Title: Soluciones exactas para la interacción de materiales de Dirac anisótropos con campos eléctricos y magnéticos
Authors: Julio Armando Mojica Zárate
Abstract: This work analyzes anisotropic Dirac materials, such as graphene and borophene, under inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields with position-dependent profiles. Exact solutions of the Dirac--Weyl equation are obtained for singular and exponentially decaying interactions, showing how anisotropy and field shape influence the energy spectrum, Landau levels, and state localization. The analysis is further extended using the Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM) in its perturbative form, applied to systems with bounded domains $( -\infty, x_0 ]$ or $( 0, x_0 ]$. In particular, we consider the case $( -\infty, x_0 ]$, where the field vanishes asymptotically. The first-order corrections reveal how the finite range $x_0$ modifies localization and transport, and how a critical electric field emerges at which Landau levels collapse, providing insight into the design of field-defined regions in two-dimensional nanoelectronic and quantum devices.

Title: Josephson Diode Effect for a Kitaev Ladder System
Authors: Cheng-Rong Xie, Hiroki Tsuchiura, Manfred Sigrist
Abstract: We study the Josephson diode effect realized purely by geometry in a Kitaev-ladder Josephson junction composed of two parallel spinless $p$-wave chains coupled by an interleg hopping $t_\perp$. The junction is governed by two phases: the superconducting phase difference across the weak link, $\theta$, and the leg-to-leg phase difference, $\phi$. For $\phi\notin \{0, \pi\}$ (mod $2\pi$), time-reversal symmetry is broken, and the absence of leg-exchange symmetry leads to a breakdown of the antisymmetry of the current-phase relation, yielding nonreciprocal Josephson transport without magnetic fields or spin-orbit coupling. By resolving transport into bonding and antibonding channels defined by $t_\perp$, it is shown that the leg phase acts as an effective phase shift for interband ($p_\nu/p_{-\nu}$) tunneling, whereas the same-band ($p_\nu/p_\nu$) contribution remains unshifted. These channels arise at different perturbative orders and, together with the $4\pi$-periodic Majorana channel that emerges near the topological transition, interfere to produce a pronounced diode response. The class-D Pfaffian invariant identifies the parameter regime where the ladder hosts Majorana zero modes. Bogoliubov-de Gennes calculations reveal a dome-like dependence of the diode efficiency $\eta$ on $t_\perp$: $\eta\to 0$ for $t_\perp\to 0$ and for large $t_\perp$, with a maximum at intermediate coupling that is tunable by $\phi$. The present results establish a field-free, geometry-based route to superconducting rectification in one-dimensional topological systems and specify symmetry and topology conditions for optimizing the effect in ladder and network devices.

Title: Controlled generation of 3D vortices in driven atomic Josephson junctions
Authors: Vijay Pal Singh, Ludwig Mathey, Herwig Ott, Luigi Amico
Abstract: We propose an ac-driven atomic Josephson junction as a clean and tunable source of three dimensional (3D) solitary waves in quantum fluids. Depending on the height of the junction barrier, the emitted excitations appear as vortex rings at low velocity or vorticity-free rarefaction pulses near the sound velocity, thus spanning the complete Jones-Roberts family of solitons. The Shapiro-step phenomenon renders the emission deterministic: on the first, second, third Shapiro steps, the junction ejects one, two, and three solitary excitations per drive cycle. This enables controlled generation of single- and multi-excitation configurations, allowing detailed studies of the full crossover between vortex rings and rarefaction pulses and their interaction dynamics. In particular, deterministic multi-ring emission provides insights into leapfrogging dynamics of two and three coaxial rings and their decay via boundary-assisted, sound-mediated processes. This ac-driven protocol establishes a compact and reproducible platform for generating, classifying, and controlling 3D solitonic excitations, paving the way for precision studies of nonlinear vortex dynamics, dissipation, and quantum turbulence in trapped superfluids.

Title: Flat electronic bands from cooperative moiré and charge order
Authors: B.K. Saika, S. Buchberger, S. Mo, A. Rajan, D. Halliday, Y.-C. Yao, L.C. Rhodes, B. Sarpi, T. Balasubramanian, C. Polley, P. Wahl, P.D.C. King
Abstract: The formation of flat electronic bands from long-wavelength superperiodic moiré potentials in van der Waals heterostructures underpins the creation and control of a host of highly-tuneable correlated and topological phases. The underlying moiré periodicity is, however, typically considered a fixed property of the heterostructure. Here, we show how the development of a charge-density wave (CDW) in one of the constituent materials can create an emergent moiré periodicity, realising a superperiodic potential in TiSe$_2$/graphite epitaxial heterostructures with an order-of-magnitude longer wavelength than that expected from the normal-state lattice mismatch. We demonstrate how this drives the formation of a remarkably strong band flattening, which can be readily deactivated by carrier doping across the CDW phase transition, opening new prospects for engineering moiré matter by exploiting the rich many-body states of the parent compounds of 2D heterostructures.

Title: Single-Atom Photocatalysts on TiO2 : Insights from X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
Authors: Yingying Li, David Morris, Peng Zhang
Abstract: Surface modification of TiO2 with single-atom catalysts (SACs) is an effective strategy for enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. However, thorough characterization of SACs at the atomic scale remains challenging. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) offers unique advantages for the in-depth analysis of TiO2-supported SACs. By employing XAS, the local atomic structure, oxidation state, and electronic properties of the SACs, as well as the underlying photocatalytic mechanism, can be revealed. Herein, we present a short review on the application of XAS in studying TiO2-supported SACs. We first elucidate the key role of XAS in simultaneously probing the structure and electronic properties of monometallic SACs across different periods. Next, we discuss XAS studies of bimetallic SACs from the perspective of each constituent element and highlight the element-specific capabilities of XAS for analyzing multi-element SACs. Finally, we demonstrate how in situ XAS can effectively monitor structural and electronic property changes in SACs under real photocatalytic reaction conditions. Additionally, we provide practical suggestions for utilizing XAS more efficiently in the analysis of various SAC systems.

Title: Surface acoustic wave enabled all-optical determination of the interlayer elastic constants of van der Waals interface
Authors: N.Yu. Frolov, A.Yu. Klokov, A. I. Sharkov, M.V. Pugachev, A.Yu. Kuntsevich
Abstract: Understanding the properties of two-dimensional materials interfaces with the substrate is necessary for device applications. Surface acoustic wave propagation through the layered material flake on a substrate could provide unique information on the transverse rigidity of the flake-to-substrate interaction. We generate ultrasonic waves by a focused femtosecond laser pulse at the surface of the model system -- fused silica with h-BN flake transferred above. Using an all-optical spatially resolved pump-probe interferometric technique, we measure the spatial dependencies of the surface vertical velocity profiles. Our measurements reveal the appearance of the surface acoustic wave dispersion in the hBN flake region compared to fused silica surface. Multilayer modeling allows us to gain access to longitudinal and shear elastic coupling constants $c^*_{33}$ and $c^*_{44}$ between hexagonal BN and substrate.

Title: Weakly universal dynamical correlations between eigenvalues of large random matrices
Authors: Kirone Mallick, Gabriel Téllez, Frédéric van Wijland
Abstract: It was shown roughly thirty years ago that the density correlations of eigenvalues of large random matrices display a universal form, independent of most of the details of the distribution of the random matrix itself. We show that when the matrix elements evolve according to a Dyson Brownian motion, dynamical correlations retain a large degree of the universality found at equal times when expressed in terms of the characteristics of some partial differential equation in the complex plane.

Title: Exchange field induced symmetry breaking in quantum hexaborides
Authors: D. Rivera, Fernando P. Sabino, H. Raebiger, A. Ruzsinszky, J. P. Perdew, G. M. Dalpian
Abstract: Symmetry breaking (SB) has proven to be a powerful approach for describing quantum materials: strong correlation, mass renormalization, and complex phase transitions are among the phenomena that SB can capture, even when coupled to a mean-field-like theory. Traditionally, corrective schemes were required to account for these effects; however, SB has emerged as an alternative that can also successfully describe the intricate physics of quantum materials. Here, we explore spin SB on EuB6 and SmB6 and how its relation to the exchange field can determine onsite properties, depending on the type of symmetry breaking. Using spin-polarized Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with the r2SCAN functional, we systematically compare four magnetic configurations, one totally symmetric - non-magnetic (NM) configuration - and three with different types of symmetry breaking: ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM) and a paramagnetic (PM) configuration - modeled through a Special Quasirandom Structure (SQS) method - to capture local symmetry-breaking effects. Our results show that the PM configuration produces distinct magnetic environments for the rare-earth atoms, leading to different exchange fields. These, in turn, induce symmetry breaking in the electronic and magnetic properties of Eu and Sm. Those results provide an alternative explanation for the experimental results on both materials, EuB6 and SmB6, where X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) measurements suggest the presence of multiple atomic environments, previously attributed to a mixed-valence configuration.

Title: Cluster percolation in the three-dimensional $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model
Authors: Lambert Münster, Martin Weigel
Abstract: Based on extensive parallel-tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the relationship between cluster percolation and equilibrium ordering phenomena in the three-dimensional $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model as one varies the fraction of antiferromagnetic bonds. We consider a range of cluster definitions, most of which are constructed in the space of overlaps between two independent real replicas of the system. In the pure ferromagnet that is contained as a limiting case in the class of problems considered, the relevant percolation point coincides with the thermodynamic ordering transition. For the disordered ferromagnet encountered first on introducing antiferromagnetic bonds and the adjacent spin-glass phase of strong disorder this connection is altered, and one finds a percolation transition above the thermodynamic ordering point that is accompanied by the appearance of /two/ percolating clusters of equal density. Only at the lower (disordered) ferromagnetic or spin-glass transition points the densities of these two clusters start to diverge, thus providing a percolation signature of these thermodynamic transitions. We compare the scaling behavior at this secondary percolation transition with the thermodynamic behavior at the corresponding ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase transitions.

Title: Excitation spectrum and low-temperature magnetism in disordered defect-fluorite Ho2Zr2O7
Authors: P. L. Oliveira Silva, J.G.A. Ramon, Viviane Peçanha-Antonio, Tatiana Guidi, J. S. Gardner, Chun Sheng Fang, R. S. Freitas
Abstract: In this work, we report on the thermomagnetic characterization and crystalline-electric field (CEF) energy scheme of the disordered defect-fluorite Ho2Zr2O7. This structural phase is distinguished by the coexistence of magnetic frustration and extensive disorder, with Ho3+ and Zr4+ sharing randomly the same 4a site with even 50% occupancy, and an average 1/8 oxygen vacancy per unit cell. AC magnetic susceptibility measurements performed on powder samples down to 0.5 K revealed signs of slowing spin dynamics without glassy behavior, including a frequency dependent peak at 1 K. Yet, no evidence for long-range magnetic order is found down to 150 mK in specific heat. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements show a weak, low-lying CEF excitation around 2 meV, accompanied by a broad level centered at 60 meV. To fit our observations, we propose an approach to account for structural disorder in the crystal-field splitting of the non-Kramers Ho3+. Our model provides an explanation to the broadening of the high-energy, single-ion excitations and suggests that the zirconate ground-state wave function has zero magnetic moment. However, structural disorder acts as guarantor of the magnetism in Ho2Zr2O7, allowing the mixing of low lying states at finite temperatures. Finally, we show that this scenario is in good agreement with the bulk properties reported in this work.

Title: From Quantum Annealing to Alloy Discovery: Towards Accelerated Design of High-Entropy Alloys
Authors: Diego Ibarra-Hoyos, Peter Connors, Ho Jang, Nathan Grain, Israel Klich, Gia-Wei Chern, Peter K. Liaw, John R. Scully, Joseph Poon
Abstract: Data scarcity remains a central challenge in materials discovery, where finding meaningful descriptors and tuning models for generalization is critical but inherently a discrete optimization problem prone to multiple local minima confounding the true optimal state. Classical methods often get trapped in these minima, while quantum annealing can escape them via quantum fluctuations, including tunneling, that overcome narrow energy barriers. We present a quantum-assisted machine-learning (QaML) framework that employs quantum annealing to address these combinatorial optimization challenges through feature selection, support-vector training formulated in QUBO form for classification and regression, and a new QUBO-based neural-network pruning formulation. Recursive batching enables quantum annealing to handle large feature spaces beyond current qubit limits, while quantum-pruned networks exhibit superior generalization over classical methods, suggesting that quantum annealing preferentially samples flatter, more stable regions of the loss landscape. Applied to high-entropy alloys (HEAs), a data-limited but compositionally complex testbed, the framework integrates models for fracture-strain classification and yield-strength regression under physics-based constraints. The framework identified and experimentally validated Al8Cr38Fe50Mn2Ti2 (at.%), a single-phase BCC alloy exhibiting a 0.2 % yield strength of 568 MPa, greater than 40 % compressive strain without fracture, and a critical current density in reducing acid nearly an order of magnitude lower than 304 stainless steel. These results establish QA as a practical route to overcome classical optimization limits and accelerate materials discovery.

Title: Chiral Cavity Control of the Interlayer Exciton Energy Spectrum
Authors: Jonathan Sanchez-Lopez, Ze-Xun Lin, Di Luo, Prineha narang
Abstract: Heterostructures of two-dimensional materials offer a versatile platform to study light-matter interactions of electron and hole gases. By separating electron and hole layers with an insulator long-lived electron-hole bound states known as interlayer excitons can form. We predict that by placing an interlayer exciton in a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking chiral cavity the energy spectrum of an interlayer exciton can be reordered. As a consequence of this reordering the ground state of the interlayer exciton can be driven from an s-orbital to a p-orbital, effectively changing the symmetry of the electron-hole pair. We present a phase diagram showing the couplings and separations required for a p-orbital excitonic ground state where we predict that larger interlayer separations require higher cavity couplings. We expect these results to be relevant for angular-momentum-tunable, single photon emission physics.

Title: Novel Pressure-Induced Transformations of PbTiO3
Authors: Husam Farraj, Stefano Racioppi, Gaston Garbarino, Muhtar Ahart, Anshuman Mondal, Samuel G. Parra, Jesse S. Smith, R. E. Cohen, Eva Zurek, Jordi Cabana, Russell J. Hemley
Abstract: We investigated the behavior of lead titanate (PbTiO3) up to 100 GPa, both at room temperature and upon laser heating, using synchrotron X ray diffraction combined with density functional theory (DFT) computations. At the high pressure temperature (PT) conditions produced in laser heated diamond anvil cells, PbTiO3 dissociates into PbO and TiO2, consistent with our DFT computations showing that decomposition becomes enthalpically favored above 65 GPa. In contrast, on room temperature compression, PbTiO3 persists in the tetragonal I4mcm phase up to at least 100 GPa. Laser heating produces distinct PbO phases: a compressed form of alpha PbO and a previously unreported delta PbO polymorph, both of which transform to beta PbO on decompression. The calculations predict that alpha PbO undergoes pressure-induced band gap closure, metallizing above 70 GPa, whereas the delta and beta phases remain semiconducting with a band gap above 1 eV even at megabar pressures. The experimental and confirming theoretical results reveal an unanticipated dimension of the behavior of PbTiO3, showing that distinct equilibrium and metastable phases can be stabilized along different PT synthesis paths.

Title: Controllable Superconductivity in Suspended van der Waals Materials

Abstract: Tunable superconductors provide a versatile platform for advancing next-generation quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate controllable superconductivity in suspended NbSe2 thin layers, achieved through local strain and thermal modulation of the superconducting state. Our results show that suspended NbSe2 structures enable strain modulation of the critical temperature by up to approximately 0.92 K (about 12.5% of the critical temperature) and allow the realization of gate-tunable superconducting critical currents. We further demonstrate configurable hysteretic transport characteristics exhibiting multistability and negative differential resistance, providing easily reconfigurable, spatially dependent superconducting states. These phenomena are well explained by calculations of electron-phonon coupling using density functional theory, together with time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau dynamics coupled to the thermal diffusion equation. Our work provides profound insight into strain and thermal modulation of van der Waals superconductors and opens new opportunities for tunable on-chip superconductor devices, integrated superconducting circuits, and quantum simulators.

Title: Impact of electron-phonon interaction on the electronic structure of interfaces between organic molecules and a MoS$_2$ monolayer
Authors: Ignacio Gonzalez Oliva, Sebastian Tillack, Fabio Caruso, Pasquale Pavone, Claudia Draxl
Abstract: By means of first-principles calculations, we investigate the role of electron-phonon interaction in the electronic structure of hybrid interfaces, formed by MoS$_2$ and monolayers of the organic molecules pyrene and pyridine, respectively. Quasiparticle energies are initially obtained within the $G_0W_0$ approximation and subsequently used to evaluate the electron-phonon self-energy and momentum-resolved spectral functions to assess the temperature renormalization of the band structure. We find that the band-gap renormalization by zero-point vibrations of both hybrid systems is comparable to that of pristine MoS$_2$, with a value of approximately 80 meV. Pronounced features of molecular origin emerge in the spectral function of the valence region, which we attribute to satellites arising from out-of-plane vibrational modes of the organic monolayers. For pyrene, this satellite exhibits a predominantly molecular character, while for pyridine, it has a hybrid nature, originating from the coupling of molecular vibrations to the MoS$_2$ valence band.

Title: An Unusual Dresselhaus Spin-Orbit Contribution of Even Order in Momentum
Authors: Hao Yang, Wei Wang, Gerson J. Ferreira, Ning Hao, Ping Zhang, Jiyong Fu
Abstract: The spin-orbit (SO) coupling is conventionally known to manifest as \emph{odd} functions of momentum. Here, through both model calculations and symmetry analysis along with the method of invariants, we reveal that, in ordinary semiconductor heterostructures, a \emph{quadratic} Dresselhaus SO term -- inheriting from its bulk crystal form -- emerges via the interband effect, while complying with time-reversal and spatial symmetries. Furthermore, we observe that this unusual SO term gives rise to a range of striking quantum phenomena, including hybridized swirling texture, anisotropic energy dispersion, avoided band crossing, longitudinal \emph{Zitterbewegung}, and opposite spin evolution between different bands in quantum dynamics. These stand in stark contrast to those associated with the usual \emph{linear} SO terms. Our findings uncover a previously overlooked route for exploiting interband effects and open new avenues for spintronic functionalities that leverage unusual SO terms of \emph{even} orders in momentum.

Title: Crossover from quantum correlation to hot-carrier transport in scattering-tolerant 2D transistors
Authors: Debottam Daw, Houcine Bouzid, Sung-Gyu Lee, Wujoon Cha, Ki Kang Kim, Min-kyu Joo, Yan Wang, Manish Chhowalla, Young Hee Lee
Abstract: Quantum correlation and hot-carrier transport represent two fundamentally distinct regimes of electronic conduction, rarely accessible within the same device. Here, we report a state-of-the-art monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides transistor architecture on a ferroelectric substrate that enables this crossover by leveraging the strong dielectric screening and in-plane gate control. At cryogenic temperatures, the devices exhibit reproducible quasi-periodic current fluctuations, consistent with an emergent potential landscape driven by electron-electron interactions at low carrier densities. As the temperature increases, this correlated potential profile thermally dissolves and transport is dominated by the lateral gate-field that drives the carriers with high kinetic energy. These hot-carriers can efficiently surmount the scattering events, exhibiting a record-high room-temperature electron mobility of ~4,800 cm^2/Vs and a maximum on-current ~0.5 mA/{\mu}m, surpassing traditional FETs in key performance metrics. These findings establish a unified approach for probing intermediate mesoscopic orders, while advancing the transistor performance limits in scalable 2D transistors.

Title: Effects of crystal field and momentum-based frustrated exchange interactions on multiorbital square skyrmion lattice
Authors: Yan S. Zha, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: Motivated by recent theoretical predictions of a square-shaped skyrmion lattice (S-SkL) in centrosymmetric tetragonal Ce-based magnets [Yan Zha and Satoru Hayami, Phys. Rev. B 111, 165155 (2025)], we perform a comprehensive theoretical investigation on the role of multiorbital effects, magnetic anisotropy, and momentum-based frustrated exchange interactions in stabilizing such topologically nontrivial magnetic textures. By employing self-consistent mean-field calculations over a broad range of model parameters, we demonstrate that the cooperative interplay among multiorbital effects, frustrated exchange interactions at higher-harmonic wave vectors, and crystal-field anisotropy is crucial for the stabilization of the S-SkL. Furthermore, the competition between the easy-plane intraorbital coupling and the easy-axis interorbital coupling leads to a significant enhancement of the S-SkL stability region. We also identify a plethora of multi-$Q$ states, including magnetic bubble lattice and double-$Q$ phases with a local/global scalar chirality. Our findings elucidate the microscopic mechanism responsible for the emergence of S-SkLs in Ce-based magnets and provide a route toward realizing skyrmion lattices in a broader class of $f$-electron materials beyond conventional Gd- and Eu-based systems lacking orbital angular momentum.

Title: Antiferromagnetic skyrmion as a magnonic lens
Authors: Hongbin Wu, Zi-Wu Wang, Jin Lan
Abstract: A lens, a device transforming propagation directions in an organized fashion, is one of the fundamental tools for wave manipulation. Spin wave, the collective excitation of ordered magnetizations, stands out as a promising candidate for future energy-saving information technologies. Here we propose theoretically and verify by micromagnetic simulations, that an antiferromagnetic skyrmion naturally serves as a lens for spin wave, when the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya strength exceeds a threshold. The underlying mechanism is the spin wave deflection caused by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, a mechanism that is ordinarily overshadowed by the magnetic topology.

Title: Exploiting Negative Capacitance for Unconventional Coulomb Engineering
Authors: Aravindh Shankar, Pramey Upadhyaya, Supriyo Datta
Abstract: It is known that the many-body ground state of a two-dimensional electron system can be tuned through Coulomb engineering by controlling the permittivity of the surrounding media. However, permittivities are traditionally restricted to positive values. In this paper we argue that the negative capacitance effect demonstrated in appropriately engineered structures can open new vistas in Coulomb engineering. Negative permittivities transform the natural repulsive interaction of electrons into an attractive one raising the intriguing possibility of a superconducting ground state. Using models of two-dimensional electron systems with linear and parabolic dispersion relations coupled to environments with negative capacitance, we estimate the strength and sign of the engineered Coulomb interaction and outline parameter regimes that could stabilize correlated electronic phases.

Title: Ground states of the Ising model at fixed magnetization on a triangular ladder with three-spin interactions
Authors: Shota Garuchava
Abstract: We study the Ising model at fixed magnetization on a triangular ladder with three-spin interactions. By recasting the ground-state determination as a linear programming (LP) problem, we solve it exactly using standard LP techniques. We construct the phase diagram for arbitrary fixed magnetization and identify three types of ground states: periodic, phase-separated, and ordered but aperiodic. When magnetization is treated as a free parameter, the ground state adopts only periodic configurations with the average magnetization per site $0$, $\pm 1/3$ or $\pm 1$, except for the phase boundaries.

Title: Unveiling the critical role of interfacial strain in adjusting electronic phase transitions in correlated vanadium dioxide
Authors: Xuanchi Zhou, Xiaohui Yao, Xiaomei Qiao
Abstract: Thermally activated abrupt switching between localized and itinerant electronic states during the insulator-metal transition (IMT) in correlated oxide systems serves as a powerful platform for exploring exotic physical phenomena and device functionality. One ongoing focal challenge lies in the realization of the broadly tunable IMT property in correlated system, to satisfy the demands of practical applications across diverse environments. Here, we unveil the overwhelming advantage associated with interfacial strain in bridging the bandwidth and band-filling control over the IMT property of VO2. Tailoring the orbital overlapping through strain-mediated bandwidth control enables a widely tunable thermally-driven IMT property in VO2. Benefiting from adjustable defect dynamics, filling-controlled Mott phase modulations from electron-localized t2g1eg0 state to electron-itinerant t2g1+{\Delta}eg0 state through oxygen vacancies can be facilitated by using in-plane tensile distortion, overcoming the high-speed bottlenecks in iontronic devices. Defect-engineered electronic phase transitions are primarily governed by the electron filling in t2g band of VO2, showcasing a definitive relationship with the incorporated defect concentration. Our findings provide fundamentally new insights into the on-demand design of emergent electronic states and transformative functionalities in correlated oxide system by unifying two fundamental control paradigms of bandwidth and band-filling control.

Title: Properties of multiterminal superconducting nanostructure with double quantum dot
Authors: G. Górski, K. Kucab, T. Domański
Abstract: We study the charge transport and thermoelectric properties of the junction, comprising double quantum dot embedded in T-shaped geometry on the interface between two normal/ferromagnetic electrodes and superconducting lead. We show that the interdot coupling plays major role in controlling the local and nonlocal transport properties of this setup. For the weak interdot coupling limit, we obtain the interferometric (Fano-type) lineshapes imprinted in the quasiparticle spectra, conductances and Seebeck coefficients. In contrast, for the strong interdot coupling, we predict that the local and nonlocal transport coefficients are primarily dependent on the molecular Andreev bound states induced by superconducting proximity effect, simultaneously in both quantum dots.

Title: Prevailing orbital excitations in paramagnetic kagome superconductor Cs(V$_{0.95}$Ti$_{0.05}$)$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Chennan Wang, Yuhang Zhang, Zhen Zhao, Zhouyouwei Lu, Hui Chen, Ziqiang Wang, Haitao Yang, Christian Bernhard, Xiaoli Dong, Hong-Jun Gao
Abstract: Using the muon as a sensitive local magnetic probe, we investigated the layered kagome superconductor Cs(V$_{0.95}$Ti$_{0.05}$)$_3$Sb$_5$, a material notably devoid of both static magnetic moments and long-range charge order. Our transverse-field $\mu$SR measurements reveal that the local magnetic susceptibility, obtained via the muon Knight shift, is dominated by orbital excitations with a split energy levels around 20 meV. Meanwhile, the persistence of itinerant electron paramagnetism down to 5 K and 7 T confirms the absence of static magnetism within this regime. In addition, zero-field (ZF) $\mu$SR experiments detect a significant increase in the inhomogeneous nuclear dipolar field distribution below a featured temperature at 70 K. We attribute this ZF-$\mu$SR feature to the emergence of local lattice distortions at low temperatures, potentially arising from orbital ordering. Significantly, our study establishes that orbital excitations constitute an intrinsic property of the layered V-Sb kagome lattice. Despite its small magnitude, spin-orbit coupling plays a crucial role in governing the lattice dynamics, potentially driving the emergence of novel phenomena such as phonon carrying angular momentum in crystals with non-chiral point groups.

Title: Magnetic field-induced degenerate ground state in the classical antiferromagnetic XX model on the icosahedron
Authors: N. P. Konstantinidis
Abstract: The ground state of the classical antiferromagnetic XX model in a magnetic field is calculated for spins mounted on the vertices of the icosahedron. The magnetization is characterized by two discontinuities as a function of the external field. For a wide field range above the first discontinuity the ground state is degenerate, with two spins related by spatial inversion aligned with the field and the rest forming two magnetization units in the form of pentagons. It is shown that the degeneracy originates from the coupling of the two pentagons, which introduces the triangle, associated with ground-state degeneracy, as an interaction unit in the icosahedron. The magnetization discontinuities are shown to evolve first from the coupling of isolated triangles and then from the coupling of the two spins related by spatial inversion.

Title: Large Spontaneous Nonreciprocal Charge Transport in a Zero-Magnetization Antiferromagnet
Authors: Kenta Sudo, Yuki Yanagi, Mitsuru Akaki, Hiroshi Tanida, Motoi Kimata
Abstract: Spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries in solids triggers diverse intriguing phenomena. Although these phenomena have been extensively studied in insulators, similar investigations for metals remain limited. Herein, we report the observation and properties of spontaneous (i.e., zero-magnetic field) nonreciprocal charge transport in the zigzag intermetallic compound NdRu2Al10. This effect is attributed to the antiferromagnetic (AF) order, which can be interpreted as a magnetic toroidal dipole order. Our results reveal an excessively large nonreciprocal coefficient for this material, attributed to the strong effective magnetic field generated through c-f exchange interactions. The results also suggest that the nonreciprocal response of this material depends on the spin configurations of the AF domains. Overall, our findings are distinct from those previously reported for field-induced nonreciprocal charge transport and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of cross-correlations in symmetry-broken metals.

Title: Design of an engaging-disengaging compliant mechanism by using bistable arches
Authors: Mehul Srivastava, Trishna Gunna, Makarand Kandiyaped Serkad, Manu Sebastian, Safvan Palathingal
Abstract: Compliant mechanisms utilise elastic deformation of their segments to transmit motion or force. The utility and behaviour of specific compliant mechanisms can be enhanced by introducing an engaging and disengaging ability with its elastic segments. Towards this, we present an engaging-disengaging compliant mechanism (EDCM) that can switch its stiffness between infinite and zero. The design of the EDCM is based on bistable arches and a locking mechanism. We describe its working, identify its design parameters, and use analytical expressions to arrive at its dimension. The design is verified by detailed finite element analysis and experiments on a 3D-printed prototype. Three alternate designs that lead us to the final mechanism are also briefly discussed.

Title: Strain-Tunable Spin Filtering and Valley Splitting Coexisting with Anomalous Hall Effect in 2D Half-Metallic VSe2/VN Heterostructure: Toward a Unified Spintronic-Valleytronic Platform
Authors: Vivek Chowdhury, Ahmed Zubair
Abstract: Rapid progress in valleytronics and spintronics is limited by the scarcity of two-dimensional materials that simultaneously provide robust valley splitting and strong spin selectivity. Here we showed that a van der Waals heterostructure (VSe2/VN) built from hexagonal VSe2 and hexagonal VN addressed this gap. Using first-principles density functional theory, phonon, ab initio molecular dynamics stability tests, Bader charge analysis, and Wannier-based Berry-curvature calculations, we demonstrated an energetically and dynamically stable heterostructure that exhibited interlayer charge transfer and a work function intermediate between the constituent monolayers. The electronic structure showed small indirect PBE gap (108.9 meV), with HSE06 indicating a half-metallic tendency; a sizable conduction-band valley splitting (\Delta CKK' = 22.9 meV for spin-up and \Delta CKK' = 61.3 meV for spin-down); and pronounced spin asymmetry, where the spin-down channel showed a wide semiconducting gap (0.64 eV) while the spin-up channel was nearly gapless. These features yielded a high zero-strain spin-filter efficiency P = 75.4%, tunable to 82.5% under +4% biaxial tensile strain. The heterostructure also supported non-zero, valley-contrasting Berry curvature, and a large anomalous Hall conductivity (peak sigmaxy = 568.33 S/cm). Importantly, mean-field estimation placed the ferromagnetic Curie temperature near room temperature at zero strain (Tc = 284.04 K), while Tc decreased to 183.9 K at +4% strain, the magnetic order remained robust to cryogenic temperatures, providing a beneficial tuning knob to balance spin-filter performance with thermal stability in device-relevant regimes. These results identified VSe2/VN as a practical, strain-tunable platform for integrated valleytronic, spintronic devices, and for exploring anomalous Hall and valley-dependent transport phenomena.

Title: Targeted synthesis of polycrystalline vanadium dioxide thin films via post-deposition annealing
Authors: Kirill Trunov, Yuri Lebedinskii, Ilya Zavidovskiy, Sergey Novikov, Alexander Morozov, Petr Shvets, Ksenia Maksimova, Andrei Zenkevich, Anton Khanas
Abstract: Implementation of neuromorphic hardware is a promising way to improve the computing efficiency and decrease the energy consumption of artificial neural networks. For this purpose, electronic elements emulating the behavior of synapses and neurons have to be developed. In order to realize electronic artificial neurons, threshold resistive switches or memristors can be efficiently used. One of the most widespread materials for threshold switches is vanadium dioxide due to its property to demonstrate the metal-insulator transition at a temperature about 70 °C. However, the processes of VO$_{2}$ synthesis are quite restrictive in temperature and gas atmosphere conditions, which hinders its integration into CMOS fabrication. In this work, we propose a new method of VO$_{2}$ synthesis: reactive pulsed laser deposition from metallic V target in oxygen atmosphere at room temperature, followed by vacuum annealing. Our method enables target synthesis of an appropriate VO$_{2}$ phase in a polycrystalline thin film form by finely tuning oxygen pressure during room temperature deposition, which allows to relax the equipment demands, such as high temperature heating in oxygen. Successful targeted VO$_{2}$ synthesis under fabrication conditions close to back-end-of-line CMOS production, achieved in this work, show the way toward its large-scale microelectronic integration for neuromorphic hardware creation.

Title: Magneto-Optical Study of Chiral Magnetic Modes in NiI$_{2}$: Direct Evidence for Kitaev Interactions
Authors: Kartik Panda, Chaebin Kim, Daniel Bazyliansky, Javier Taboada-Gutiérrez, Florian Le Mardelé, Jan Dzian, Guy Levy, Jae Ha Kim, Youjin Lee, Bumchan Park, Martin Mourigal, Jae Hoon Kim, Alexey B. Kuzmenko, Milan Orlita, Je-Geun Park, Nimrod Bachar
Abstract: Bond-dependent magnetic interactions, particularly those described by the Kitaev model, have emerged as a key pathway toward realizing unconventional magnetic states such as quantum spin liquids and topologically nontrivial excitations, including skyrmions. These interactions frustrate conventional magnetic order and give rise to rich collective behavior that continues to challenge both theory and experiment. While Kitaev physics has been extensively explored in the context of honeycomb magnets, direct evidence for its role in real materials remains scarce. Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring low-dimensional electrical, magnetic, and correlated electronic phenomena, and provide a fertile ground for potential applications ranging from spintronics to multiferroic devices and quantum information technologies. Here, we demonstrate, through magneto-transmission, Faraday angle rotation, and magnetic circular dichroism measurements, that the magnetic excitation spectrum of NiI$_2$, a van der Waals multiferroic material, is more accurately captured by a Kitaev-based spin model than by the previously invoked helical spin framework.

Title: The number of spanning trees as an indicator of critical phenomena: When Kirchhoff meets Ising
Authors: Roberto da Silva, Henrique A. Fernandes, Paulo G. Freitas, Sebastian Gonçalves, E. V. Stock, A. Alves
Abstract: Visibility graphs are spatial interpretations of time series. When derived from the time evolution of physical systems, the graphs associated with such series may exhibit properties that can reflect aspects such as ergodicity, criticality, or other dynamical behaviors. It is important to describe how the criticality of a system is manifested in the structure of the corresponding graphs or, in a particular way, in the spectra of certain matrices constructed from them. In this paper, we show how the critical behavior of an Ising spin system manifests in the spectra of the adjacency and Laplacian matrices constructed from an ensemble of time evolutions simulated via Monte Carlo (MC) Markov Chains, even for small systems and short MC steps. In particular, we show that the number of spanning trees -- or its logarithm -- , which represents a kind of \emph{structural entropy} or \emph{topological complexity} here obtained from Kirchhoff's theorem, can, in an alternative way, describe the criticality of the spin system. These findings parallel those obtained from the spectra of correlation matrices, which similarly encode signatures of critical and chaotic behavior.

Title: Ordering in statistical systems on the way to the thermodynamic limit
Authors: V.I. Yukalov, E.P. Yukalova
Abstract: It is well known that the mathematically accurate description of ordering and related symmetry breaking in statistical systems requires to consider the thermodynamic limit. But the order does not appear from nowhere, and yet before the thermodynamic limit is reached, there should exist some kind of preordering that appears and grows in the process of increasing the system size. The quantitative description of growing order, under the growing system size, is developed by introducing the notion of {\it order indices}. The rigorous proof of the phase transition existence is a separate difficult problem that is not the topic of the present paper. We illustrate the approach resorting to several models in the mean-field approximation, which makes it possible to demonstrate the notion of order indices for finite systems in a clear way. We show how the order grows on the way to the thermodynamic limit for Bose-Einstein condensation, arising superconductivity, magnetization, and crystallization phenomena.

Title: Phonon-Dominated Thermal Transport and Large Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz Law in Topological Semimetal CoSi
Authors: Luyao Zhong, Xin Jin, Mingquan He, Rui Wang, Xiaoyuan Zhou, Tianqi Deng, Xiaolong Yang
Abstract: The Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law, relating the electronic thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm e}$) to the electrical conductivity, is vital in numerous applications such as in the design of thermoelectric materials and in the experimental determination of the lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$). While the WF law is generally robust, violations are frequently observed, typically manifesting in a reduced Lorenz number ($L$) relative to the Sommerfeld value ($L_0$) due to inelastic scattering. Here, we report a pronounced departure from the WF law in the topological semimetal CoSi, where the electronic Lorenz number ($L_{\rm e}$) instead rises up to $\sim40\%$ above $L_0$. We demonstrate that this anomaly arises from strong bipolar diffusive transport, enabled by topological band-induced electron-hole compensation, which allows electrons and holes to flow cooperatively and additively enhance the heat current. Concurrently, we unveil that the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity is anomalously large and becomes the dominant component below room temperature. As a result, if $\kappa_{\rm L}$ is assumed negligible -- as conventional in metals, the resulting $L$ from the total thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm tot}=\kappa_{\rm L}+\kappa_{\rm e}$) deviates from $L_0$ by more than a factor of three. Our work provides deeper insight into the unconventional thermal transport physics in topological semimetals.

Title: Magnetic and structural properties of epitaxial Er-substituted yttrium iron garnet films grown by pulsed laser deposition
Authors: Lukas Flajsman, Lars Peeters, Armi Kosunen, Lide Yao, Ionela Vrejoiu, Sebastiaan van Dijken
Abstract: Er-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Er:YIG) holds the potential of combining the low magnetic damping of YIG with the telecom-band optical transitions of $\text{Er}^{3+}$ ions, making it a suitable material for hybrid optomagnonic devices and microwave-to-optical quantum transduction. We report the epitaxial growth of $\text{Er}_{x}\text{Y}_{3-x}\text{Fe}_{5}\text{O}_{12}$ films with $x=0.008-0.20$ on (111)-oriented gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates using pulsed laser deposition. X-ray diffraction, reciprocal space mapping, and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm single-phase, fully coherent growth with atomically sharp interfaces across the entire substitution range. Magnetometry reveals a gradual decrease in saturation magnetization with increasing Er content, consistent with antiparallel coupling between Er$^{3+}$ spins and the net Fe$^{3+}$ moments, along with the emergence of an in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. The ferromagnetic resonance broadens with Er concentration due to increased Gilbert damping and inhomogeneous linewidth broadening. Films with low Er content ($x=0.008$), most relevant for optomagnonic applications, retain nearly isotropic magnetization and exhibit a damping parameter only slightly higher than that of undoped YIG. These results identify growth and substitution conditions that preserve YIG's low-loss magnetic properties while introducing optical functionality, establishing Er:YIG as a viable platform for hybrid quantum magnonics and microwave-to-optical transduction.

Title: Robustness of bipolaronic superconductivity to electron-density-phonon coupling
Authors: Chao Zhang
Abstract: We study bipolaron formation and bipolaronic superconductivity on a square lattice, where electrons couple to both local Holstein phonons via on-site charge density and nonlocal bond Su-Schrieffer-Heeger phonons via modulation of hopping amplitudes. Using an unbiased Diagrammatic Monte Carlo method, we investigate how the interplay between these two types of electron-phonon coupling affects the bipolaron binding energy, effective mass, spatial extent (quantified by the mean-squared radius), and the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$. We find that, in some parameter space, the moderate Holstein coupling, though detrimental to $T_c$ when acting alone, can enhance superconductivity when combined with the bond SSH coupling by further compressing the bipolaron without significantly increasing its mass. Similarly, introducing bond SSH coupling into a Holstein bipolaron reduces its size while keeping the effective mass nearly unchanged, leading a higher $T_c$. These effects give rise to nonmonotonic behavior and reveal a cooperative regime in which both couplings work together to enhance superconductivity. We further examine phonon frequency asymmetry, particularly the case $\omega_H/t = 2\omega_B/t$, and show that in the deep adiabatic regime, adding Holstein coupling can even raise $T_c$ when combined with bond SSH coupling. These results highlight the distinct and complementary roles of local Holstein and non-local bond SSH electron-phonon couplings, and suggest strategies for optimizing high-$T_c$ superconductivity in systems with multiple phonon modes.

Title: Linear tetramer formation in nonmagnetic pyrochlore niobate
Authors: Shota Nishida, Shunsuke Kitou, Shingo Toyoda, Yuiga Nakamura, Yusuke Tokunaga, Taka-hisa Arima
Abstract: We investigate displacive short-range order in pyrochlore Y2Nb2O7, which exhibits a nonmagnetic insulating state despite the presence of formally tetravalent Nb4+ (S = 1/2) ions on the pyrochlore network. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction on a single crystal reveals a characteristic x-ray diffuse scattering (XDS) pattern primarily around q = {0.5, 0.5, 2}. Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simulations uncover local Nb displacements along the <111> axes, leading to the formation of linear Nb4 tetramers. Our findings highlight a crucial role of molecular orbital degrees of freedom in stabilizing the nonmagnetic insulating state. This study demonstrates that RMC analysis of XDS provides a powerful approach for elucidating short-range correlations and the underlying mechanisms governing the physical properties of crystalline materials.

Title: Active Noise Reduction in Si/SiGe Gated Quantum Dots
Authors: Rajat Bharadwaj, Parvathy Gireesan, Harikrishnan Sundaresan, Chithra H Sharma, Lucky Donald L Kynshi, Prasad Muragesh, D. Bougeard, Madhu Thalakulam
Abstract: Solid-state quantum technologies such as quantum dot qubits and quantum electrical metrology circuits rely on quantum phenomena at ultra-low energies, making them highly sensitive to various forms of environmental noise. Conventional passive filtering schemes can reduce high-frequency noise but are often ineffective against low-frequency interference, like powerline or instrument-induced. Extending such filters to lower frequencies causes practical issues such as longer stabilization times, slower system response, and increased Johnson noise, which impede low-frequency transport measurements. To address these limitations, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a generalized active noise cancellation scheme for quantum devices operating at sub-Kelvin temperatures. Our approach compensates periodic environmental interference by dynamically injecting a phase-coherent anti-noise signal directly into the device. We employ an automated feedback protocol featuring beat-frequency reduction and adaptive phase-amplitude tuning, enabling real-time compensation without any manual intervention. Unlike post-processing or passive filtering, this method suppresses noise at the device level without introducing additional time constants. We implement the scheme on a gate-defined Si/SiGe quantum dot subject to strong 50 Hz powerline interference and validate its effectiveness through acquiring Coulomb Blockade Oscillations and Coulomb diamond plots. The technique achieves substantial suppression of both the targeted interference and the overall noise floor, thereby stabilizing transport characteristics and enhancing device fidelity. While demonstrated on a quantum dot, the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide class of solid-state quantum devices where deterministic noise presents a critical bottleneck.

Title: Decoupling interface and thickness effects on hydrogen absorption in V/MgO: experiments and DFT
Authors: Qiuxiang Zhang, Yan Zhu, Xiaofang Peng, Weiguang Yang, Yuping Le, Xiao Xin
Abstract: We report combined experimental and first principles investigations of hydrogen absorption in epitaxial vanadium films on MgO(001) with nominal thicknesses of 10 nm and 50 nm. In - situ optical transmission and four - probe resistance isotherms show that the 50 nm film reproduces bulk like behavior with a clear first order alpha-beta hydride transition, the formation enthalpy and entropy gradually decrease with increasing hydrogen concentration. The 10 nm film, by contrast, displays continuous uptake without plateaus, with formation enthalpies H that are relatively close in magnitude to the 50 nm film (both exhibiting exothermic behavior in the range of approximately 0.5 to 0.3 eV/H), but with a more negative entropy change S (larger S) indicating reduced configurational freedom for hydrogen in the ultrathin limit; the critical temperature for phase coexistence is suppressed below 400 K. Density functional theory calculations on MgO V superlattices (Vn/(MgO)n, n = 3,5,7) reveal pronounced V 3d and O 2p hybridization and interfacial charge redistribution that weaken hydrogen binding near the interface and recover toward bulk values with increasing V thickness. These results indicate that interfacial electronic structure, in addition to finite size energetics, governs hydride stability in ultrathin V films and that layer - thickness and interface engineering can tune reversible hydrogen uptake.

Title: Spin-valley 0.7 anomaly in bilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ quantum point contacts
Authors: Jonas D. Gerber, Efe Ersoy, Michele Masseroni, Markus Niese, Artem O. Denisov, Christoph Adam, Lara Ostertag, Jessica Richter, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Yigal Meir, Thomas Ihn, Klaus Ensslin
Abstract: We report a well-resolved 0.7 conductance anomaly at $G = 0.7\times(2e^2/h)$ in bilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ quantum point contacts. Proximity-enhanced spin-orbit coupling splits the four-fold ground state of bilayer graphene into well-separated spin-valley locked Kramers doublets. The anomaly emerges between these opposite spin-valley states. Despite fundamentally different band structure and wavefunction characteristics, the temperature and bias phenomenology closely mirror GaAs systems. In contrast, the parallel magnetic field response differs significantly, confirming the central role of valley degrees of freedom. This opens new pathways to study valley-exchange correlation physics in regimes inaccessible to conventional semiconductors.

Title: Ultrafast symmetry modulation and induced magnetic excitation in the Kagome metal RbV3Sb5
Authors: Mengxue Guan, Xiaodong Zhou, Jingyi Duan, Chaoxi Cui, Wei Jiang, Zeying Zhang, Binhua Zhang, Zhengwei Nie, Xun Shi, Zhiwei Wang, Yugui Yao
Abstract: Light-matter interaction in frustrated Kagome metals enables access to hidden quantum states, yet the microscopic origin of symmetry breaking under ultrafast excitation remains elusive. Here, we uncover a microscopic mechanism for laser-induced symmetry breaking in RbV3Sb5 through first-principles real-time simulations. Selective excitation of a single-QM phonon mode dynamically breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries within the 2X2X1 charge density wave (CDW) superlattice. The resulting anisotropic lattice distortion lifts geometric frustration and stabilizes a nonequilibrium ferrimagnetic phase, accompanied by a sizable intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Distinct from prior interpretations based on orbital antiferromagnetism or extrinsic perturbations, our findings reveal a spin-driven pathway for symmetry breaking under strong optical fields. These results provide a microscopic foundation for exploring how spin, lattice and charge degrees of freedom are intertwined in nonequilibrium correlated states.

Title: Comprehensive Validation of Replica Symmetry Breaking via Quantum Annealing: From Ground States to Topological Collapse
Authors: Kumar Ghosh
Abstract: Giorgio Parisi's exact solution of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, recognized with the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics, revealed revolutionary hierarchical organization in disordered systems, yet systematic validation has remained computationally intractable beyond $N \sim 100$ spins, and the topological limits of this complexity remain unexplored. Here we leverage quantum annealing to extend ground-state computations to 4000 spins and systematically probe both the emergence and breakdown of replica symmetry breaking. Three independent measurements validate core RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value $E_\infty/N = -0.7633$ with predicted $N^{-2/3}$ finite-size corrections; chaos exponent $\theta = 0.51 \pm 0.02$ confirms mean-field square-root scaling ($R^2 = 0.989$); and state-space overlap distribution exhibits broad continuous structure ($\sigma_q = 0.19$) characteristic of hierarchical landscape organization. We then investigate RSB robustness by introducing controlled network dilution via the Blume-Capel model with vacancy formation. Remarkably, hierarchical complexity remains invariant under 36\% dilution, proving RSB is a topological property of network connectivity rather than spin density. Beyond a critical threshold in the range $0.8 < D_c < 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously as the system undergoes complete conversion to the all-vacancy state within a narrow parameter window an abrupt avalanche-driven transition where independent-vacancy mean-field theory correctly predicts the energy scale but fails to capture the cooperative dynamics. This comprehensive validation across thermodynamics, universality, landscape geometry, and topological limits establishes quantum advantage for probing fundamental statistical mechanics in complex systems relevant to neural networks, optimization, and materials science.

Title: Phase transitions in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice
Authors: Jie Qiao, Shu-Hao Zhang, Jing-Bo Qin, Xiao-Long Zhao, Qiang Cheng
Abstract: The nature of the intermediate ground-state phase in the spin-1/2 frustrated square lattice model has long been debated. Using cluster density matrix embedding theory, we investigate the phase diagram of this model. The Neel phase is directly identified for J2<0.45 and the collinear phase for J2>0.65 based on the ground state. Although no direct evidence of an internal phase transition is found within the intermediate phase from the ground state, analysis of the first excited state wave function reveals a continuous quantum phase transition in this region, with a critical point at J2=0.55. This critical point divides the intermediate phase into PVBS and CVBS.

Title: Metamagnetic Transition in Low-Dimensional Site-Decorated Quantum Heisenberg Ferrimagnets
Authors: Weiguo Yin, A. M. Tsvelik
Abstract: The prohibition of finite-temperature phase transition in one-dimensional (1D) Ising models and 1D/2D quantum Heisenberg models with short-range interactions fundamentally constrains the application potentials of low-dimensional magnetic materials. Recently, ultranarrow phase crossover (UNPC), which can approach a transition at a desirable finite temperature $T_0$ arbitrarily closely, was discovered in 1D decorated Ising chains and ladders. Here we present a theoretical study of similarly decorated, yet much more challenging, quantum Heisenberg ferrimagnets in a magnetic field, which features ferromagnetic backbone exchange $J$, antiferromagnetic site-decoration coupling $J_{AF}$, and different magnetic moments for the backbone and decorating spins $\mu_aS_a<\mu_bS_b$. We exactly solved the model in the large $J$ limit -- as a central-macrospin model -- and found two finite-temperature second-order transitions; just above $T_{c2}$ a ``half-ice, half-fire'' regime appears. Finite-$J$ weak-field results follow from an effective-field mapping, suggesting the emergence of UNPC at finite $T_0$ in 2D square lattices thanks to its exponentially strong initial magnetic susceptibility $\chi_0\propto e^{4\pi S_a^2 J/T_0}$, though less likely in 1D chains where $\chi_0\propto J/T_0$. These results may shed light on new technological applications of low-dimensional quantum spin systems and attract experimental and computational tests.

Title: Facile Salt-Assisted Hydrothermal Synthesis of Nanodiamonds from CHO Precursors: Atomic-Scale Mechanistic Insights

Abstract: Hydrothermal synthesis offers an economical and scalable way to produce nanodiamonds under relatively mild, low-pressure and low-temperature conditions. However,its sustainability and the detailed mechanisms behind diamond formation in such environments are still not fully understood. In this work, we designed ten hydrothermal synthesis protocols using different CHO-based molecular precursors containing COOH and OH groups, such as organic acids, polyols, sugars, and this http URL reactions were carried out at 190 degrees Centigrade in chlorinated, strongly alkaline aqueous solutions with alkali and alkaline-earth metal ions. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we confirmed the presence of diamond-specific lattice planes and sp3-hybridized carbon structures. Our results show that the type of precursor, its molecular size, and the ionic composition of the solution play key roles in determining the defect patterns and polymorph distribution in the resulting nanodiamonds. Atomic-scale imaging showed both coherent and incoherent transitions from graphite to diamond, along with gradual lattice compression and complex twinning patterns. These observations provide direct insight into how interfacial crystallography and defect dynamics drive diamond formation in aqueous systems. Overall, the study positions hydrothermal synthesis as a sustainable, chemistry-driven, and tunable approach for creating nanodiamonds tailored for applications in quantum technologies, biomedicine, catalysis, and advanced materials.

Title: Enhanced Coalescence in Driven Foams
Authors: Alice Requier, Andrea Plati, Emmanuelle Rio, Anniina Salonen
Abstract: External driving leads to the emergence of unique phenomena and properties in soft matter systems. We show that driving quasi-2D foams by mechanical vibration results in significant bubble coalescence, which is enhanced by the continuous phase yield stress. The competition between coarsening and coalescence can be modulated through vibration amplitude and foam liquid fraction, which can be used to create unusual structural motifs. The combined effect of coarsening and coalescence is captured through a statistical model that quantitatively describes the time evolution of the number of bubbles.

Title: Resonating valence bond pairing energy in graphene by quantum Monte Carlo
Authors: S. Azadi, A. Principi, T.D. Kühne, M.S. Bahramy
Abstract: We determine the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state in graphene using real-space quantum Monte Carlo with correlated variational wave functions. Variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations with Jastrow-Slater-determinant and Jastrow-antisymmetrized-geminal-power ansatze are employed to evaluate the RVB pairing energy. Using a rectangular graphene sample that lacks $\pi/3$ rotational symmetry, we found that the single-particle energy gap near the Fermi level depends on the system size along the $x$-direction. The gap vanishes when the length satisfies $L_x=3n\sqrt{3}d$, where $n$ is an integer and $d$ is the carbon-carbon bond length, otherwise, the system, exhibits a finite gap. Our DMC results show no stable RVB pairing in the zero-gap case, whereas the opening of a finite gap near the Fermi level stabilizes the electron pairing. The DMC predicted absolute value of pairing energy at the thermodynamic limit for a finite-gap system is $\sim 0.48(1)$ mHa/atom. Our results reveal a feometry-driven electron pairing mechanism in the confined graphene nanostructure.

Title: Machine learning intermolecular transfer integrals with compact atomic cluster representations
Authors: Keerati Keeratikarn, Christoph Ortner, Jarvist Moore Frost
Abstract: Calculating intermolecular charge transfer integrals in organic semiconductors requires substantial computer resource for each individual calculation. We might alternatively construct a machine learning model for transfer integrals, which model the full six-degrees of freedom for the relative position of dimer pairs, trained on representative calculations for the molecules of interest. Recent developments have produced effective machine learning force fields, which model the total energy of atomic assemblies. We extend the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) with the correct symmetries for transfer (kinetic-energy) integrals. Combined with a spherical harmonic basis makes, this forms a strong inductive bias and makes for a data efficient model. We introduce coarse-grained and heavy-atom representations, and assess the methodology on representative conjugated semiconductors: ethylene, thiophene, and naphthalene.

Title: Thermal conductivity of commodity polymers under high pressures
Authors: Otavio Higino Moura de Alencar, James Mu, Marcus Müller, Debashish Mukherji
Abstract: Understanding the thermal conductivity of polymers under high--pressure conditions is essential for a range of applications, from aerospace and deep--sea engineering to common lubricants. However, the complex relationship between pressure, $P$, the thermal transport coefficient, $\kappa$, and polymer architecture poses substantial challenges to both experimental and theoretical investigations. In this work, we study the pressure--dependent thermal transport properties of a widely used commodity polymer -- poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) -- using a combination of all--atom molecular dynamics simulations and semi-analytical approaches. While we report both classical and quantum-corrected estimates of $\kappa$, the latter approach reveals that as the pressure increases from 1 atm to 10 GPa, $\kappa$ rises by up to a factor of four -- from 0.21 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ to 0.80 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. To better understand the mechanisms behind this increase, we disentangle the contributions from bonded and nonbonded monomer interactions. Our analysis shows that nonbonded energy-transfer rates increase by a factor of six over the pressure range, while bonded interactions show a more modest increase -- about a factor of three. This observation further consolidates the fact that the nonbonded interactions play the dominant role in dictating the microscopic heat flow in polymers. These individual energy-transfer rates are also incorporated into a simplified heat diffusion model to predict $\kappa$. The results obtained from different approaches show internal consistency and align well with available experimental data. Additionally, some data for polylactic acid (PLA) are presented.

Title: Mechanical instability generates monodisperse colloidosomes
Authors: Seungwoo Shin, Federico Cao, Robert A. Pelcovits, Thomas R. Powers, Zvonimir Dogic
Abstract: Formation and rupture of vesicles is a fundamental process underlying diverse phenomena in biology, materials science, and biomedical applications. Vesicles form when the area of a growing disk-like membrane exceeds a critical value at which the edge and bending energies balance each other. Observing such topological transitions in lipid bilayers is a challenge because of their nanoscale dimensions and rapid dynamics. We study a scaled-up model of colloidal membranes assembled from rod-shaped colloidal particles. The unique features of colloidal membranes enable the real-time visualization of spontaneous closure driven by instability relevant to all membrane-based materials. First-principles theory quantitatively predicts the instability point for vesicle formation and intermediate membrane conformations during the disk-to-vesicle transition. The instability generates monodisperse, selectively permeable colloidosomes with size controlled by gravity and membrane thickness, providing a scalable and programmable platform for diverse applications.

Title: A passive atomtronics filter for Fermi gases
Authors: Jun Hao Hue, Martin-Isbjörn Trappe, Piotr T. Grochowski, Jonathan Lau, Leong-Chuan Kwek
Abstract: We design an atomtronic filter device that spatially separates the components of a two-component Fermi gas with repulsive contact interactions in a two-dimensional geometry. With the aid of density--potential functional theory (DPFT), which can accurately simulate Fermi gases in realistic settings, we propose and characterize a barbell-shaped trapping potential, where a bridge-shaped potential connects two ring-shaped potentials. In the strongly repulsive regime, each of the ring traps eventually stores one of the fermion species. Our simulations are a guide to designing component filters for initially mixed, weakly repulsive spin components. We demonstrate that the functioning of this barbell design is robust against variations in experimental settings, for example, across particle numbers, for small deformations of the trap geometry, or if interatomic interactions differ from the bare contact repulsion. Our investigation marks the first step in establishing DPFT as a comprehensive simulation framework for fermionic atomtronics.

Title: Shape-controlled growth of two-dimensional kagome-lattice colloidal crystals through nanoparticle capping
Authors: Rui Huang, Jordan Austin-Frank Wilson, Allen Sun, Artemis Harlow, Zhiwei Li
Abstract: Organic capping ligands can selectively bind to crystal facets to modulate growth kinetics and are important in chemical synthesis of inorganic nanocrystals. Using the capping ligands for shape-controlled growth of colloidal crystals is challenging due to the size mismatch of molecules and nanoparticle building blocks. In existing synthetic pathways, colloidal crystal shapes are determined by their thermodynamically favored phases yet controlling their shapes independent of lattice symmetry is vital to study many solid-state properties. Here, we develop a nanoparticle capping strategy to control colloidal crystal shapes and structural heterogeneity. Au bipyramids were used as building blocks and assembled into rhombohedral colloidal crystals driven by DNA hybridization. In (111) planes of the crystals, bipyramids assembled into kagome lattices, featuring structure cavities organized in a hexagonal lattice. The rhombohedral crystals have truncated tetrahedral crystal habits, and the degree of truncation defines the exposed facets and crystal shapes. Our surface capping strategy is to introduce DNA-modified nanospheres as effective capping agents, which selectively register on the surface vacancies of the kagome facets and resemble the role of organic ligands in classic nanocrystal growth. Such selective capping is driven by maximizing DNA hybridization and leads to slower growth of the (111) kagome facets, changing the crystal shape from three-dimensional truncated tetrahedra to two-dimensional layered microplates with structural heterogeneity and shape anisotropy. This study underpins the importance of capping agents in colloidal crystal growth and inspires effective ways to control the growth kinetics and heterostructures of colloidal crystals.

Title: Quantum Monte Carlo study of magnetism and chiral d+id-wave superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Shi-Chao Fang, Xin-Yi Liao
Abstract: We employ a large-scale, unbiased constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method to systematically simulate the effective two-orbital Hubbard model for twisted bilayer graphene in order to gain deeper insight into the relationship between correlated states and the superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted bilayer graphene, as well as the influence of the twist angle on superconductivity. Initially, we investigate the modulation of superconductivity by nearest-neighbor attractive Coulomb interactions, demonstrating that electron-phonon coupling plays a significant role in the system. Our numerical results reveal that the superconducting state is dominated by chiral NN-d+id superconducting electron pairing symmetry, and that such nearest-neighbor attractive Coulomb interactions significantly enhance the effective long-range pairing correlation function of chiral NN-d+id wave. Then, we explore how the twist angle affects the superconducting state. Our results show that as the twist angle deviates downward from 1.08°, the effective pairing correlation function of the chiral NN-d+id wave increases substantially. Through these investigations, our numerical findings not only contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of strongly correlated systems such as twisted bilayer graphene, but also provide guidance for identifying twist-angle systems with potentially higher superconducting transition temperatures.

Title: KTaO3-based editable superconducting diode
Authors: Yishuai Wang, Wenze Pan, Meng Zhang, Yanwu Xie
Abstract: Superconducting diodes, which enable dissipationless supercurrent flow in one direction while blocking it in the reverse direction, are emerging as pivotal components for superconducting electronics. The development of editable superconducting diodes could unlock transformative applications, including dynamically reconfigurable quantum circuits that adapt to operational requirements. Here, we report the first observation of the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in LaAlO3/KTaO3 heterostructures, a two-dimensional oxide interface superconductor with exceptional tunability. We observe a strong SDE in Hall-bar (or strip-shaped) devices under perpendicular magnetic fields (< 15 Oe), with efficiencies above 40% and rectification signals exceeding 10 mV. Through conductive atomic force microscope lithography, we demonstrate reversible nanoscale editing of the SDE's polarity and efficiency by locally modifying the superconducting channel edges. This approach enables multiple nonvolatile configurations within a single device, realizing an editable superconducting diode. Our work establishes LAO/KTO as a platform for vortex-based nonreciprocal transport and provides a pathway toward designer quantum circuits with on-demand functionalities.

Title: Colloidal rod dynamics under large amplitude oscillatory extensional flow
Authors: Steffen M. Recktenwald, Vincenzo Calabrese, Amy Q. Shen, Giovanniantonio Natale, Simon J. Haward
Abstract: We perform a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the orientational dynamics of rod-like colloidal particles in dilute suspension as they are subjected to a time-dependent homogeneous planar elongational flow. Our experimental approach involves the flow of dilute suspensions of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) within a cross-slot-type stagnation point microfluidic device through which the extension rate is modulated sinusoidally over a wide range of Péclet number amplitudes ($Pe_0$) and Deborah numbers ($De$). The time-dependent orientation of the CNC is assessed via quantitative flow-induced birefringence measurements. For small $Pe_0 \lesssim 1$ and small $De \lesssim 0.03$, the birefringence response is sinusoidal and in phase with the strain rate, i.e., the response is linear. With increasing $Pe_0$, the response becomes non-sinusoidal (i.e., nonlinear) as the birefringence saturates due to the high degree of particle alignment at higher strain rates during the cycle. With increasing $De$, the CNC rods have insufficient time to respond to the rapidly changing strain rate, leading to asymmetry in the birefringence response around the minima and a residual effect as the strain rate passes through zero. These varied dynamical responses of the rod-like CNC are captured in a detailed series of Lissajous plots of the birefringence versus the strain rate. Experimental measurements are compared with simulations performed on both monodisperse and polydisperse systems, with rotational diffusion coefficients $D_r$ matched to the CNC. A semiquantitative agreement is found for simulations of a polydisperse system with $D_r$ heavily weighted to the longest rods in the measured CNC distribution. The results will be valuable for understanding, predicting, and optimizing the orientation of rod-like colloids during transient processing flows such as fiber spinning and film casting.

Title: Compression-induced magnetic obstructed atomic insulator and spin singlet state in antiferromagnetic KV2Se2O
Authors: Liucheng Chen, Jiayi Yue, Jingwen Cheng, Jianli Bai, Zexiao Zhang, Xiaoli Ma, Fang Hong, Genfu Chen, Jian-Tao Wang, Zhijun Wang, Xiaohui Yu
Abstract: Among the complex many-body systems, the metal-insulator transition stands out as a cornerstone and a particularly fertile ground for scientific inquiry. The established models including Mott insulator, Anderson localization and Peierls transition, are still insufficient to capture the complex and intertwined phenomena observed in certain material systems. KV2Se2O, a newly discovered room-temperature altermagnetic candidate exhibiting a spin-density-wave transition below 100 K, provides a unique platform to investigate the interplay of many-body effects and unconventional magnetism, specifically the anticipated metal-insulator transition under extreme conditions. Here, we report a compression-induced insulator by suppressing the metallic behavior without structural phase transition. The newly opened gap is estimated to be 40 meV at around 43.5 GPa, given direct evidence for the insulating state. A concurrent switching of carrier type demonstrates the large Fermi surface reconstruction crossing the metal-insulator transition. The density functional theory calculations indicate that the discovered V+2.5-based insulator is a magnetic obstructed atomic insulator, being a spin-singlet state with bonding orbital order. This work not only presents an archetype of a pressure-driven metal-insulator transition decoupled from structural change but also delivers fundamental physical insights into the metal-insulator transition.

Title: Interface Roughness Scattering Processes in Quantum wells in a Tilted Quantizing Magnetic Field
Authors: M.P. Telenkov, Yu.A. Mityagin
Abstract: Scattering processes by the interface roughness in a quantum well in a quantizing magnetic field are considered. An expression for the scattering rate is derived for a magnetic field tilted relative to the quantum well layers. By analyzing this expression, trends in the behavior of the scattering rate are established with variation in the magnetic field strength and orientation, the potential profile of the quantum well, and the interface roughness parameters.

Title: Broad Feshbach resonance with a large background scattering length in a fermionic atom-molecule mixture
Authors: Zhen Su, Tong-Hui Shou, Huan Yang, Jin Cao, Bo-Yuan Wang, Ting Xie, Jun Rui, Bo Zhao, Jian-Wei Pan
Abstract: We report the observation of a broad magnetic Feshbach resonance with a large background scattering length in an ultracold fermionic mixture of $^{23}$Na$^{40}$K molecules and $^{40}$K atoms, with both species prepared in their lowest hyperfine states. The Feshbach resonance is characterized by measuring resonantly enhanced loss rates and elastic scattering cross sections via cross-species thermalization. The large background scattering length can drive the atom-molecule mixture into the hydrodynamic regime when the magnetic field is far from the resonance. We observe that the center-of-mass motions of the atoms and molecules are phase-locked and oscillate with a common frequency due to hydrodynamic drag effects. This broad atom-molecule Feshbach resonance with its large background scattering length opens up a new avenue towards studying strongly interacting fermionic gases with mass imbalance.

Title: Universal two-stage dynamics and phase control in skyrmion formation
Authors: Shiwei Zhu, Xinyuan Guan, Zhen Sun, Qiuyao Zhang, Changsheng Song
Abstract: We uncover a universal two-stage dynamics during skyrmion formation and establish its connection to equilibrium phases through the introduction of a chiral correlation $\chi$. Stage I involves stripe coarsening governed by the exchange-to-DMI ratio $J'$, while stage II entails stripe contraction driven by the synergy between $J'$ and the anisotropy-to-DMI ratio $K'$. The magnetic field-to-DMI ratio $B'$ influences both stages. By combining symbolic regression with neural networks, we model the competition and cooperation among these parameters and derive a skyrmion formation criterion, $0.58 K'J' + \mu B'J' > 1$. Our model disentangles their distinct roles: $J'$ sets the stripe width, $K'$ primarily controls the skyrmion size, and $B'$ strongly affects the topological charge. This approach provides a general framework for predicting and controlling magnetic phases in chiral magnets.

Title: Heat Coulomb blockade in a double-island metal-semiconductor device
Authors: A. V. Parafilo
Abstract: We study the thermal transport properties of a mesoscopic device comprising two metallic islands embedded in a two-dimensional electron gas in the integer quantum Hall regime. It is shown that the $2M$ ballistic edge channels connecting the islands to the external reservoirs and the $N$ inter-island channels play a central role in the phenomenon of heat Coulomb blockade. Unlike the single-island case, where the heat flux is reduced by exactly one quantum of thermal conductance, we predict an additional suppression proportional to the factor $M^2/(2N+M)^2$. We further examine a configuration in which the islands are placed between electrodes at different temperatures and identify the conditions under which the Wiedemann-Franz law is violated.

Title: Polarization - Magnetization Coupling in Visible Light Ferroelectric Double Perovskites
Authors: Sathiyamoorthy Buvaneswaran, Trilochan Sahoo, Saurabh Ghosh
Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), arising from broken inversion symmetry in ferroelectrics, offers a distinct pathway toward high-efficiency next-generation photovoltaics. We propose and investigate A/A$^\prime$-ordered double perovskites KLaFeMoO$_6$ and NaLaFeMoO$_6$ as promising single-phase ferroelectric photovoltaic (FE-PV) materials. First-principles calculations reveal robust P2$_1$ symmetry with A-site layer and B-site rock-salt ordering, accompanied by hybrid improper ferroelectricity driven by $a^{-}a^{-}c^{+}$ octahedral tilts. Both compounds exhibit significant spontaneous polarization and indirect band gaps of $\sim$ 1.8 eV, well suited for visible-light absorption ($>$10$^5$ cm$^{-1}$). Low carrier effective masses along the polar axis indicate efficient charge transport. \textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) show that polarization-coupled magnetization switching is feasible above room temperature, making these materials suitable for room-temperature applications.

Title: Anomalous Enhancement of Yield Strength due to Static Friction
Authors: Ryudo Suzuki, Takashi Matsushima, Tetsuo Yamaguchi, Marie Tani, Shin-ichi Sasa
Abstract: Friction is fundamental to mechanical stability across scales, from geological faults and architectural structures to granular materials and animal feet. We study the mechanical stability of a minimal friction-stabilized structure composed of three cylindrical particles arranged in a triangular stack on a floor under gravity. We analyze the yield force, defined as the threshold compressive force applied quasi-statically from above at which the structure collapses due to sliding at the floor contact. Using singular perturbation analysis, we derive an expression which quantitatively predicts the yield force as a function of the static friction coefficient and a small dimensionless parameter $\epsilon$ characterizing elastic deformation.

Title: Machine Learning Approach to Predict the Curie Temperature of Fe- and Pt-Based Alloys
Authors: Svitlana Ponomarova, Oleksandr Ponomarov, Yurii Koval
Abstract: Various techniques can be employed to determine the temperature of magnetic transformation, whether it be the Curie or Neel temperature. The standard procedure typically involves creating alloys with defined compositions and performing measurements experimentally. Alternatively, these temperatures can be predicted based on a material known physical and chemical properties prior to experiments. We identified an optimal feature set and selected the most effective algorithm. Our findings show that the Voting Ensemble model, when combined with Monte Carlo cross-validation, achieves the highest prediction accuracy. The normalized root mean squared error serves as the primary performance metric. For implementation, we utilize the Azure Machine Learning framework for its robust computational and integration capabilities. This approach offers an efficient and reliable strategy for designing and predicting the Curie temperature of ternary alloys. The paper also highlights potential applications of the model and its extensions for other systems.

Title: Tunable phononic transparency and opacity with isotopic defects
Authors: Zhun-Yong Ong
Abstract: In an isotopically disordered harmonic chain, phonon transmission attenuates exponentially with distance because of multiple scattering by the isotopic defects. We propose a simple method, which is based on the static structure factor, for arranging the isotopic defects to suppress or enhance phonon scattering within a targeted frequency window, resulting in maximization or minimization of phonon transmission. The phononic transparency and opacity effects are demonstrated numerically from the frequency dependence of the transmission coefficient. We briefly discuss how the underlying concept can be extended to the design of aperiodic superlattices to improve or block phononic transmission.

Title: Mobility of Lactose in Milk Powders
Authors: Armin Afrough, Pernille Andersen, Tanja Ninette Angelika Weihrauch, Dennis Wilkens Juhl, Serafim Bakalis, Kirsten Gade Malmos, Thomas Vosegaard
Abstract: Lactose is the major component of milk powders and is normally found to be in a glassy/amorphous state. During storage, lactose is known to participate in physicochemical processes, including crystallization on the surface and reaction with proteins such as $\beta$-lactoglobulin. Lactose needs to be mobile to participate in such processes. However, there is a lack of evidence of its mobility in milk powders. In this study, we demonstrate that some of the lactose becomes mobile when milk powders are exposed to humid air $-$ an inappropriate storage condition. This mobility is evidenced by peaks in magic angle spinning $^{1}\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectra of milk powders in the range of 3.5 ppm to 4.0 ppm, which stem from lactose molecules displaying considerable rotational mobility. These signals have a longitudinal relaxation time constant T1 similar to that of mobile water according to 2D T1$-\delta(^{1}\mathrm{H})$ experiments under magic angle spinning. Furthermore, 2D $^{1}\mathrm{H}-^{13}\mathrm{C}$ HSQC magic angle spinning experiments of skim milk powder demonstrate the same fingerprint as that of lactose in the solution, confirming our observations.

Title: On the thermodynamic analogy of intracellular diffusivity fluctuations
Authors: Yuichi Itto
Abstract: Two recent topics on a formal thermodynamic analogy of intracellular diffusivity fluctuations observed experimentally in normal/anomalous diffusion are reported. Not only the analogs of the quantity of heat and work as well as the internal energy but also that of the Clausius inequality are identified. Then, the analog of the heat engine is constructed to characterize extraction of the diffusivity change as the analog of work during a cycle, the efficiency of which is formally equivalent to that of the Carnot engine, making the total change of the entropy concerning the fluctuations vanish. The effect of the slow variation of the fluctuations on the efficiency is also briefly discussed.

Title: Physical properties and first-principles calculations of an altermagnet candidate Cs$_{1-δ}$V$_2$Te$_2$O
Authors: Chang-Chao Liu, Jing Li, Ji-Yong Liu, Jia-Yi Lu, Hua-Xun Li, Yi Liu, Guang-Han Cao
Abstract: We report the crystal growth, structure, physical properties, and first-principles calculations of a vanadium-based oxytelluride Cs$_{1-\delta}$V$_2$Te$_2$O. The material possesses two-dimensional V$_2$O square nets sandwiched by tellurium layers, with local crystallographic symmetry satisfying the spin symmetry for a $d$-wave altermagnet. An antiferromagnetic transition at 293 K is unambiguously evidenced from the measurements of magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. In addition, a secondary transition at $\sim$70 K is also observed, possibly associated with a Lifshitz transition. The first-principles calculations indicate robust Néel-type collinear antiferromagnetism in the V$_2$O plane. Consequently, spin splittings show up in momentum space, in relation with the real-space mirror/rotation symmetry. Interestingly, the V-$d_{yz}/d_{xz}$ electrons, which primarily contribute the quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surface, turns out to be fully orbital- and spin-polarized, akin to the case of a half metal. Our work lays a solid foundation on the potential applications utilizing altermagnetic properties in vanadium-based oxychalcogenides.

Title: Density-dependent sodium-storage mechanisms in hard carbon materials
Authors: Alexis Front, Tapio Ala-Nissila, Miguel A. Caro
Abstract: Understanding the sodium-storage mechanism in hard carbon (HC) anodes is crucial for advancing sodium-ion battery (SIB) technology. However, the intrinsic complexity of HC microstructures and their interactions with sodium remains poorly understood. We present a multiscale methodology that integrates grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations with a machine-learning interatomic potential based on the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework to investigate sodium insertion mechanisms in hard carbons with densities ranging from 0.7 to 1.9 g cm$^{-3}$. Structural and thermodynamic analyses reveal that increasing carbon density reduces pore size and accessibility, thereby modulating the relative contributions of adsorption, intercalation, and pore filling to the overall storage capacity. Low-density carbons favor pore-filling, achieving extremely high capacities at near-zero voltages, whereas high-density carbons primarily store sodium through adsorption and intercalation, leading to lower but more stable capacities. Intermediate-density carbons ($1.3-1.6$ g cm$^{-3}$) provide the most balanced performance, combining moderate capacity ($\approx 400$ mAh g$^{-1}$), safe operating voltages, and minimal volume expansion ($<10$\%). These findings establish a direct correlation between carbon density and electrochemical behavior, providing atomic-scale insight into how hard carbon morphology governs sodium-storage. The proposed framework offers a rational design principle for optimizing HC-based SIB anodes toward high energy density and long-term cycling stability.

Title: Ultra-long-range spin coupling in graphene revealed by atomically resolved spin excitations
Authors: Beatriz Viña-Bausá, Antonio. T. Costa, Joao Henriques, Eva Cortés-del Río, Roberto Carrasco, Pierre Mallet, Jean-Yves Veuillen, Joaquín Fernández-Rossier, Iván Brihuega
Abstract: Magnetic interactions between localized spins-1/2 play a central role in quantum magnetism, spin-based quantum computing, and quantum simulation. The range and strength of these interactions are key figures of merit. Here, we probe exchange interactions in pairs and trimers of spins-1/2 introduced by chemisorption of individual hydrogen atoms on graphene. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, supported by large-scale mean-field Hubbard calculations, we demonstrate 3 meV exchange couplings at separations beyond 10 nm, surpassing all prior systems. The couplings can be ferro- or antiferromagnetic depending on the relative sublattice arrangement. Real-space mapping of spin excitation amplitudes enables characterization with atomic-resolution. Through atomic manipulation we extend this control to spin trimers, revealing collective spin excitations when pairwise exchange couplings are comparable.

Title: Plasmon resonance in a sub-THz graphene-based detector: theory and experiment
Authors: I.M. Moiseenko, E. Titova, M. Kashchenko, D. Svintsov
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of photovoltage generation in a bilayer graphene (BLG) transistor structure exposed to subterahertz radiation. The device features a global bottom and split top gate, enabling independent control of the band gap and Fermi level, thereby enabling the formation of a tunable p-n junction in graphene. Measurements show that the photovoltage arises primarily through a thermoelectric mechanism driven by heating of the p-n junction in the middle of the channel. We also provide a theoretical justification for the excitation of two-dimensional plasmons at a record-low frequency of 0.13 THz, which manifests itself as characteristic oscillations in the measured photovoltage. These plasmonic resonances, activated by a decrease in charge carrier concentration due to opening of the band gap, lead to a local enhancement of the electromagnetic field and an increase in the carrier temperature in the junction region. The record-low frequency of plasmon resonance is enabled by the low carrier density achievable in the bilayer graphene upon electrical induction of the band gap.

Title: Controlling the Size of Nanoparticles Using a Magnetic Field: A Sphere Packing Approach
Authors: Yazeed Tawalbeh, Marwa Ghazi, Mauro Fernandes Pereira
Abstract: We present an analytical framework that predicts and controls nanoparticle size through external magnetic fields, uniting first-principles thermodynamics with a sphere packing approach. Calibrated to diamagnetic silver nanoparticles (20 nm at zero field and 5 nm at 250 mT), the model yields a closed-form relation between radius and field that reproduces the observed shift in most-probable size. Within the limits of classical capillarity and spherical demagnetization, the field lowers the nucleation barrier and drives the distribution toward smaller particles. Our results are robust for radii above 3 nm (5740 atoms). Below this scale non-extensive effects likely dominate, as discussed in detail in Supplementary Information. The approach generalizes to both diamagnetic and paramagnetic systems and the limitations expected for very small or ferromagnetically ordered nanoparticles are discussed.

Title: Challenges in predicting positron annihilation lifetimes in lead halide perovskites: correlation functionals and polymorphism
Authors: Kajal Madaan, Guido Roma, Jasurbek Gulomov, Pascal Pochet, Catherine Corbel, Ilja Makkonen
Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged in the last decade as a new important class of semiconductors for a variety of optoelectronic applications. A lot of previous studies were thus devoted to the characterisation of their point defects. Positron annihilation spectroscopy is a well recognized tool for probing vacancies in materials. Recent applications of this technique to APbX$_3$ halide perovskites are sparse, and the rare theoretical predictions of positron lifetimes in these materials, published in association with experiments, do not fully agree with each other. These works suggest that vacancies on the A site are not detected. In our theoretical study we focus on the role of the electron-positron correlation functional. We thoroughly revisit and compare several approximations when applied to methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI$_3$) with or without vacancies, as well as inorganic perovskites CsPbI$_3$ and CsPbBr$_3$, in various phases. We show also the relationship between the size of the voids, through Voronoi volumes, and the calculated lifetimes. For the cubic phases we investigate in detail the role of polymorphism, including the distribution of vacancy formation energies and positron annihilation lifetimes. In our lifetimes calculations, apart from older and more recent semi-local approximations for the electron-positron correlation potential, we also consider the weighted density approximation (WDA), which is truly non-local and should better describe positron annihilation in regions with strong electronic density variations. We show that for this class of materials, and especially for cations vacancies, the influence of the chosen approximation is crucial, much stronger than in metals, alloys and conventional semiconductors. This influence may induce to reconsider the interpretation of experimentally determined lifetimes.

Title: High-resolution magnetostriction measurements of the Pauli-limited superconductor Sr2RuO4
Authors: Shunichiro Kittaka, Yohei Kono, Toshiro Sakakibara, Naoki Kikugawa, Shinya Uji, Dmitry A. Sokolov, Kazushige Machida
Abstract: We performed high-resolution magnetostriction measurements on the Pauli-limited superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ using high-quality single crystals. A first-order superconducting transition, accompanied by pronounced hysteresis, was observed under in-plane magnetic fields, where the relative length change of the sample, $\Delta L/L$, was on the order of $10^{-8}$. To ensure the reliability of the measurements, particular attention was paid to minimizing the influence of magnetic torque, which can significantly affect data under in-plane field configurations, via field-angle-resolved magnetostriction. Within the hysteresis regime, slightly below the Pauli-limited upper critical field, a hump-like anomaly in the magnetostriction coefficient was identified. Furthermore, a characteristic double-peak structure in the field-angle derivative of the magnetostriction provides additional support for this anomaly. Although these findings may reflect a lattice response associated with the emergence of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, the possibility of a broadened first-order transition cannot be excluded. Notably, this magnetostriction anomaly qualitatively deviates from the FFLO phase boundary suggested by previous NMR measurements, highlighting the necessity for further experimental and theoretical investigations to elucidate the nature of the FFLO state in this material.

Title: Coupling of Lipid Phase Behavior and Protein Oligomerization in a Lattice Model of Raft Membranes
Authors: Subhadip Basu, Oded Farago
Abstract: Membrane proteins often form dimers and higher-order oligomers whose stability and spatial organization depend sensitively on their lipid environment. To investigate the physical principles underlying this coupling, we employ a lattice Monte Carlo model of ternary lipid mixtures that exhibit liquid-disordered ($L_d$) and liquid-ordered ($L_o$) phase coexistence. In this framework, proteins are represented as small membrane inclusions with tunable nearest neighbor interactions with both lipids and other proteins, allowing us to examine how protein-lipid affinity competes with protein-protein interactions and lipid-lipid demixing. We find that the balance of these interactions controls whether proteins remain dispersed, assemble into small oligomers, or form large stable clusters within $L_o$ domains, and that increasing the protein concentration further promotes coarsening of the ordered phase. To incorporate ligand-regulated activation, we extend the model to a kinetic Monte Carlo scheme in which proteins stochastically switch between inactive and active states with distinct affinities. The inverse switching rate, relative to the time required for a protein to diffuse across the characteristic size of the $L_o$ domains, governs the aggregation behavior. Rapid switching yields only transient small oligomers, slow switching reproduces the static limit with persistent large clusters, and intermediate rates produce broad cluster-size distributions. These results highlight the interplay between lipid phase organization, protein-lipid affinity, and activation dynamics in regulating membrane protein oligomerization, a coupling that is central to signal transduction and membrane organization in living cells.

Title: Perspective on Moreau-Yosida Regularization in Density-Functional Theory
Authors: Markus Penz, Michael F. Herbst, Trygve Helgaker, Andre Laestadius
Abstract: Within density-functional theory, Moreau-Yosida regularization enables both a reformulation of the theory and a mathematically well-defined definition of the Kohn-Sham approach. It is further employed in density-potential inversion schemes and, through the choice of topology for the density and potential space, can be directly linked to classical field theories. This perspective collects various appearances of the regularization technique within density-functional theory alongside possibilities for their future development.

Title: Wafer-Scale Films of Two-Dimensional Materials via Roll-to-Roll Mechanical Exfoliation
Authors: Yigit Sozen, Thomas Pucher, Bhagyanath Paliyottil Kesavan, Nuria Jimenez-Arevalo, Julia Hernandez-Ruiz, Zdenek Sofer, Carmen Munuera, Juan J. Riquelme, Andres Castellanos-Gomez
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate an improved version of the roll-to-roll mechanical exfoliation method, incorporating a controlled sliding motion into the exfoliation process to achieve uniform nanosheet films of two-dimensional materials at wafer-scale. This scalable technique enables the fabrication of high-quality films suitable for electronic and optoelectronic applications. We validate the process by fabricating WSe2 phototransistors directly on the exfoliated films, achieving performance metrics comparable to the best reported devices based on electrochemically exfoliated material. The all-dry transfer method employed ensures minimal contamination and preserves the intrinsic properties of the material. This work highlights the potential of high-throughput mechanical exfoliation as a cost-effective and reliable route for large-scale production of 2D material-based devices.

Title: Non-local synchronization of continuous time crystals in a semiconductor
Authors: Alex Greilich, Nataliia E. Kopteva, Vladimir L. Korenev, Philipp A. Haude, Linus Kunze, Ben W. Grobecker, Sergiu Anghel, Markus Betz, Manfred Bayer
Abstract: Synchronization resulting in unified collective behavior of the individual elements of a system that are weakly coupled to each other has long fascinated scientists. Examples range from the periodic oscillation of coupled pendulum clocks to the rhythmic behavior in biological systems. Here we demonstrate this effect in a solid-state platform: spatially remote, auto-oscillating electron-nuclear spin systems in a semiconductor. When two such oscillators separated by up to 40 ${\mu}$m are optically pumped, their individually different frequencies lock to a common value, revealing long-range coherent coupling. For larger separations, the synchronization breaks. The interaction distance matches the electron spin diffusion length, identifying spin transport as the coupling-mediating mechanism and establishing phase coherence over mesoscopic distances. As a consequence, a wide-area optical pump drives all oscillators within the illuminated spot into a single synchronized state, despite their inhomogeneity. This synchronization accounts for the exceptional stability of the resulting auto-oscillations, enabling collective motion in distributed spin systems and paving the way toward coherent spin networks in spintronics.

Title: Controlling viscosity to engineer focal conic domains in photonic cellulose nanocrystal films
Authors: Diogo V. Saraiva, Lotte Polling, Ivo R. Vermaire, Sander J. W. Vonk, Freddy T. Rabouw, Lisa Tran
Abstract: Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) form cholesteric architectures that can have color specific reflectivity and enable sustainable photonic films. However, achieving uniform color, suppressing iridescence, and accessing ordered defect structures such as focal conic domains remain challenging. Here, we control the photonic properties of CNC films by steering the self assembly process. Across 24 dish-cast films with varying salt concentrations and sonication doses, we combine viscosity measurements, timelapse polarized optical microscopy, and angle-resolved reflectance spectroscopy to correlate evaporation dynamics with photonic structure. We show that viscosity, jointly controlled by NaCl-mediated electrostatic screening and sonication-induced bundle fragmentation, dictates the extent of tactoid coalescence. Low-viscosity suspensions generate large, homogeneous cholesteric domains and narrow spectral responses, while high viscosity leads to arrested, heterogenous domains and increased diffuse light reflection. Critically, within a narrow parameter window of intermediate ionic strength and moderate sonication, we reproducibly engineer photonically active focal conic domains. These results identify viscosity-driven flow as a key, previously underappreciated factor in CNC self-assembly and establish design rules for producing structurally colored films with tunable photonic response, reduced iridescence, and controllable defect architectures.

Title: The Microscopic Structure of Stacking Faults in Sr$_2$NaNb$_5$O$_{15}$
Authors: Robin Sjökvist, Yining Xie, Zabeada Aslam, Andy P. Brown, Nicholas C. Bristowe, Mark S. Senn, Richard Beanland
Abstract: Stacking faults and other topological defects in ferroics can have a significant influence on the electronic and mechanical properties of the material. Here, regular stacking faults in the tetragonal tungsten bronze material Sr$_2$NaNb$_5$O$_{15}$ are investigated through transmission electron microscopy, symmetry mode analysis and machine-learned force-field calculations. It is shown that the faults, with a fault vector of $\frac{1}{4}[\bar{2}12]_o$, annihilate in sets of four in the material, owing to the $\frac{1}{4}$ unit cell displacement along the b-axis. The four resulting domains emerge as four possible directions of the S$_3$ order parameter, related to NbO$_6$ octahedral tilts in the material. Force-field calculations reveal that the stacking faults are likely placed at positions where the octahedra in neighbouring domains have similar magnitudes of rotation, and that the estimated stacking fault energy is 46 mJ/m$^2$. The investigation shows that the stacking faults have a significant local effect on the polar modes present in the structure, and therefore could affect the ferroelectric properties.

Title: Microscopic origin of period-four stripe charge-density-wave in kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Yuma Murata, Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Seiichiro Onari, Hiroshi Kontani
Abstract: The interplay between unconventional density waves and exotic superconductivity has attracted growing interest. Kagome superconductors $A\rm{V}_3\rm{Sb}_5$ ($A = \rm{K}, \rm{Rb}, \rm{Cs}$) offer a platform for studying quantum phase transitions and the resulting symmetry breaking. Among these quantum phases, the $4a_0$ stripe charge-density-wave (CDW) has been widely observed for $A=\rm{Rb}$ and $\rm{Cs}$ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. However, the microscopic origin of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW remains elusive, and no theoretical studies addressing this phenomenon have been reported so far. In this paper, we propose a microscopic mechanism for the emergence of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW. We analyze the CDW instability in the 12-site kagome lattice Hubbard model with the $2\times2$ bond order driven by the paramagnon-interference mechanism by focusing on the short-range magnetic fluctuations due to the geometrical frustration of kagome lattice. We reveal that the nesting vector of the reconstructed Fermi surface, formed by the $2\times 2$ bond order, gives rise to a $4a_0$-period CDW. Remarkably, the obtained stripe CDW is composed of both the off-site hopping integral modulations and on-site potentials. The real-space structure of the stripe CDW obtained here is in good qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed stripe pattern.

Title: Low Temperature Two Fluid State in SmB6
Authors: Sayantan Ghosh, Sugata Paul, Tamoghna Chattoraj, Ritesh Kumar, Zachary Fisk, S. S. Banerjee
Abstract: Comprehensive study using DC transport, specific heat, magnetization, and two-coil mutual inductance measurements unveils an understanding of three temperature regimes in SmB$_6$: (i) $T \geq T^{*}$ ($\sim66$K), (ii) $T_g$ ($\sim40$ K) $\leq T < T^{*}$, and (iii) $T < T_g$. Onset of Kondo breakdown below $T^{*}$ releases disorder-driven magnetic fluctuations, which splits the bulk ($\sim116$K) and surface Kondo temperature ($T_k^{s} \approx 7$ K). Below $T_g$, as magnetic fluctuations subside, surface Kondo screening revives, stabilizing the topological surface state and generating an in-gap feature ($\sim2.2$ meV) across which Dirac-like carriers are excited. Nyquist impedance analysis reveals a crossover from purely capacitive to capacitive-inductive behavior, signalling a disorder-driven two-fluid phase of heavy quasiparticles and light, high-mobility carriers below $T_g$. We identify a characteristic length scale, $L_{\nu_0}(T)$, associated with the high-mobility phase, exhibiting an almost divergent trend below $T_k^{s}$. These findings underscore the complex nature of the surface conducting state in SmB$_6$.

Title: Why Extensile and Contractile Tissues Could be Hard to Tell Apart
Authors: Jan Rozman, Sumesh P. Thampi, Julia M. Yeomans
Abstract: Active nematic models explain the topological defects and flow patterns observed in epithelial tissues, but the nature of active stress-whether it is extensile or contractile, a key parameter of the theory-is not well established experimentally. Individual cells are contractile, yet tissue-level behavior often resembles extensile nematics. To address this discrepancy, we use a continuum theory with two-tensor order parameters that distinguishes cell shape from active stress. We show that correlating cell shape and flow, whether in coherent flows in channels, near topological defects, or at rigid boundaries, cannot unambiguously determine the type of active stress. Our results demonstrate that simultaneous measurements of stress and cell shape are essential to fully interpret experiments investigating the nature of the physical forces acting within epithelial cell layers.

Title: Electrical conductivity of randomly placed linear wires: a mean field approach
Authors: Yuri Yu. Tarasevich, Andrei V. Eserkepov, Irina V. Vodolazskaya
Abstract: Using the mean-field approximation, a formula for the effective electrical conductivity of a two-dimensional system of randomly arranged conducting sticks with a given orientation distribution was obtained. Both the resistance of the sticks themselves and the resistance of the contacts between them were taken into account. The accuracy in the resulting formula was analyzed. A comparison of the theoretical predictions of mean-field approach with the results of direct electrical conductivity calculations for several model orientation distributions describing systems with crossed sticks demonstrated good agreement.

Title: Designing new Zintl phases SrBaX (X = Si, Ge, Sn) for thermoelectric applications using \textit{ab initio} techniques
Authors: Vivek Gusain, Mohd Zeeshan, B. K. Mani
Abstract: Slack's phonon-glass and electron-crystal concept has been the guiding paradigm for designing new thermoelectric materials. Zintl phases, in principle, have been shown as great contenders of the concept and thereby good thermoelectric candidates. With this as motivation, we design new Zintl phases SrBaX (X = Si, Ge, Sn) using state-of-the-art computational methods. Herein, we use first-principles simulations to provide key theoretical insights to thermal and electrical transport properties. Some of the key findings of our work feature remarkably low lattice thermal conductivities ($<$~1~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$), putting proposed materials among the well-known thermoelectric materials such as SnSe and other contemporary Zintl phases. We ascribe such low values to antibonding states induced weak bonding in the lattice and intrinsically weak phonon transport, resulting in low phonon velocities, short lifetimes, and considerable anharmonic scattering phase spaces. Besides, our results on electronic structure and transport properties reveal tremendous performance of SrBaGe ($ZT\sim$ 2.0 at 700~K), highlighting the relevance among state-of-the-art materials such as SnSe. Further, the similar performances for both $p$- and $n$-type dopings render these materials attractive from device fabrication perspective. We believe that our study would invite experimental investigations for realizing the true thermoelectric potential of SrBaX series.

Title: Sedimentation profiles and phase stacking diagrams in polydisperse hard rounded rectangle fluids
Authors: Tobias Eckert, Daniel de las Heras, Enrique Velasco, Yuri Martínez-Ratón
Abstract: We analyze the sedimentation behavior of a polydisperse two-dimensional liquid-crystal fluid using a local density functional theory based on scaled particle theory. Polydispersity is incorporated through variations in the roundness of hard rectangular particles interacting solely via excluded area effects. Despite its simplicity, the model displays a rich phenomenology. In bulk, the fluid exhibits isotropic, nematic, and tetratic phases. In sedimentation, we obtain complex phase stacking diagrams featuring multiphasic stacking sequences with up to four stacks of different bulk phases, inverted stacking sequences such as top isotropic and bottom nematic together with top nematic and bottom isotopic, as well as stacking sequences with reentrant stacks such as tetratic and nematic stacks floating between two isotropic stacks. This phenomenology arises as a result of an intricate coupling between particle polydispersity and the effect of gravity. Our approach can be easily adapted to investigate the sedimentation behaviour of other polydisperse colloidal systems.

Title: Chiral phases and dynamics of dipoles in triangular optical ladders
Authors: Arjo Dasgupta, Mateusz Łącki, Henning Korbmacher, Gustavo A. Domínguez-Castro, Jakub Zakrzewski, Luis Santos
Abstract: Dipoles in triangular optical ladders constitute a flexible platform for the study of the interplay between geometric frustration and long-range anisotropic interactions, and in particular for the observation of the spontaneous onset of chirality. Frustration magnifies the effect of the dipolar interactions in itinerant polarized dipolar bosons. As a result, the dipole-induced transition between a chiral superfluid and a non-chiral two-component superfluid may be observed for current state-of-the-art temperatures even for the weak inter-site interaction characterizing magnetic atoms in standard optical lattices. On the other hand, pinned spin-$1/2$ dipoles, which we discuss in the context of polar molecules in two rotational states, realize frustrated dipolar XXZ spin models. By controlling the external electric field strength and orientation, these systems can explore a rich ground-state landscape including chiral and nematic phases, as well as intriguing chiral dynamics.

Title: Magnetic anisotropy and intermediate valence in CeCo$_5$ ferromagnet
Authors: Alexander B. Shick, Evgenia A. Tereshina-Chitrova (Institute of Physics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Na Slovance 2, 182 21 Prague, Czech Republic)
Abstract: The intermediate valence of Ce in CeCo$_5$ challenges standard density functional theory (DFT) and static DFT+$U$ approaches, which fail to capture its magnetic properties. By combining DFT+$U$ with exact diagonalization of the Anderson impurity model for the Ce 4$f$ shell, we find a substantial reduction of Ce spin and orbital moments, consistent with DFT+DMFT, arising from Ce$^{4+}$ - Ce$^{3+}$ valence fluctuations. The total magnetic moment of 6.70 $\mu_B$ agrees with experiment, and the calculated $4f$ density of states reproduces photoemission and Bremsstrahlung isochromat spectra. The uniaxial magnetic anisotropy energy reaches 4.8 meV/f.u. when Coulomb correlations on both Ce 4$f$ and Co 3$d$ shells are included, in very good agreement with experimental data. These results highlight the importance of dynamical correlations and provide guidance for exploring high-performance, low-rare-earth-content permanent magnets.

Title: Uniaxial stress control of versatile helimagnetic phases in the square-lattice itinerant magnet EuAl$_{4}$
Authors: Masaki Gen, Takuya Nomoto, Hiraku Saito, Taro Nakajima, Yusuke Tokunaga, Rina Takagi, Shinichiro Seki, Taka-hisa Arima
Abstract: We investigate uniaxial-stress effects on the magnetic phase diagram of the square-lattice itinerant magnet EuAl$_{4}$, where strong coupling among spin, lattice, and charge produces a variety of helimagnetic phases, including rhombic and square skyrmion lattices. Combining resistivity and magnetization measurements with neutron scattering, we find that compressive stresses of only several tens of MPa along [010] enhance antiferromagnetic character and shorten the magnetic modulation period in the lowest-temperature single-Q spiral state, thereby driving the critical temperatures and fields of multiple phases to higher values. First-principles calculations show that increasing orthorhombic lattice distortion deforms the Fermi surface relevant to the magnetism, providing compelling evidence that Fermi-surface nesting plays a crucial role in stabilizing the helical magnetic modulations in EuAl$_{4}$.

Authors: Luiz H. G. Tizei, Yves Auad, Florian Castioni, Mathieu Kociak
Abstract: Electron spectroscopy implemented in electron microscopes provides high spatial resolution, down to the atomic scale, of the chemical, electronic, vibrational and optical properties of materials. In this review, we will describe how temporal coincidence experiments in the nanosecond to femtosecond range between different electron spectroscopies involving photons, inelastic electrons and secondary electrons can provide information bits not accessible to independent spectroscopies. In particular, we will focus on nano-optics applications. The instrumental modifications necessary for these experiments are discussed, as well as the perspectives for these coincidence techniques.

Title: Synchronizing microwave cQED limit-cycle oscillators
Authors: Cecilie Hermansen, Jens Paaske
Abstract: Self-sustained oscillators play a central role in the stabilization and synchronization of complex dynamical systems. A number of different physical systems are currently being investigated to clarify the importance of such active components in the quantum realm. Here we explore the properties of a driven dissipative electron-photon hybrid system based on superconducting microwave resonators coupled resonantly to a voltage-biased double quantum dot (DQD). First, we establish a Hopf bifurcation at a critical value of the electron-photon coupling, beyond which an effective negative friction sustains steady limit-cycle oscillations of individual resonators. Second, we show that two such limit-cycle resonators coupled via the same voltage-biased DQD synchronize for small enough frequency detuning. A nonlinear photon Keldysh action is derived by perturbation theory in the effective circuit fine-structure constant, and the limit-cycle dynamics is analyzed in terms of resulting saddle-point, and Fokker-Planck equations. In the Markovian limit of infinite bias voltage, these results are shown to agree well with the solution of a corresponding Lindblad master equation for the DQD resonator system.

Title: Complementary and Asymmetric Tapered Bent Mid-Infrared Waveguide Arrays for Subwavelength-Pitch Integration and Crosstalk Minimization
Authors: Humaira Zafar, Mauro Fernandes Pereira
Abstract: This paper delivers the first report of a mid-infrared (MIR) waveguide array design that employs complementary and asym- metric tapered Euler-shaped bends. These provide greater fabrication flexibility to achieve subwavelength-pitch integration while reducing crosstalk to below 30 dB across the 3.1 to 3.6 micron wavelength range. Unlike previous designs, which main- tained constant waveguide widths, the Euler waveguide bends are characterized by asymmetric and complementary tapered waveguide widths. This approach significantly reduces crosstalk to below 30 dB for both the first and second neighboring waveguides across a 500 nm wavelength range, enhancing the efficiency of optical phased arrays (OPA) with a large field of view, optimizing light propagation and minimizing crosstalk. The waveguide array is fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator platform, with a 2-micron buried oxide layer and a 500 nm-thick silicon layer. The design is highly tolerant to fabrication variations, maintaining consistent performance even with width variations. The spectral responses, simulated using the 3D finite-difference time-domain method, demonstrate negligible coupling and low insertion loss across the wavelength range. This work offers a robust and CMOS-compatible solution for MIR integrated photonic circuits.

Title: Pattern formation in ring condensates subjected to bichromatic driving
Authors: Premabrata Manna, S. I. Mistakidis, P. G. Kevrekidis, Pankaj Kumar Mishra
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical formation of nonlinear patterns in one-dimensional ring condensates under bichromatic periodic modulation of the interaction strength. The stability phase diagram of the condensate's homogeneous density state is analytically derived through a suitable biharmonic variant of the Mathieu equation and computing the associated Floquet spectrum. It reveals the complex interplay between the driving parameters, i.e., amplitude, frequencies, and the so-called frequencies' mixing angle, which dictate the instability onset and the selective enhancement of higher-order resonance tongues, thus offering precise control over the excited modes. These results are in agreement with time-dependent mean-field simulations evidencing the emergence of density wave modulations of specific momenta, while enabling a deeper understanding of the nonlinear stage of the relevant instability. Further insights on the ensuing unstable nonlinear dynamics are provided through a reduced {five-mode} model which captures the instability onset, the oscillatory behavior of the mode populations and the phase-space dynamics, in agreement with the mean-field predictions. Our study highlights the versatility of bichromatic driving to generate and control complex nonlinear patterns that are within reach in present day ultracold atom experiments.

Title: Defect-Mediated Phase Engineering of 2D Ag at the Graphene/SiC Interface

Henshaw, Shreya Mathela, Maxwell Wetherington, William H. Blades, Kenneth Knappenberger, Ursula Wurstbauer, Su Ying Quek, Ulrich Starke, Shengxi Huang, Vincent H. Crespi, Joshua A. Robinson
Abstract: Atomically thin silver (Ag) films offer unique opportunities in plasmonic, quantum optics, and energy harvesting, yet conventional growth methods struggle to achieve structural control at the monolayer limit. Here, we demonstrate phase-selective synthesis of large-area, crystalline 2D Ag films via defect-engineered confinement heteroepitaxy (CHet) at the epitaxial graphene/silicon carbide (EG/SiC) interface. By tuning graphene growth and post-growth defect introduction, two distinct Ag phases are achieved with disparate properties: a nearly commensurate Ag(1) lattice stabilized by vacancy and line defects in epitaxial graphene, and a denser Ag(2) phase preferentially grown with sp3-rich zero-layer graphene. Structural and spectroscopic characterization confirm lattice registry with the SiC substrate, while theoretical calculations reveal a thermodynamic preference for Ag(2) but an easier nucleation for Ag(1). Both phases are found to be semiconducting, with the Ag(2) phase exhibiting slightly enhanced n-doping of graphene. Notably, nonlinear optical measurements reveal a three-order magnitude difference in second-order susceptibility between the two phases, demonstrating promise for phase-tunable 2D metals in reconfigurable optoelectronic and metamaterial platforms.

Title: Direct imaging of magnetotransport at graphene-metal interfaces with a single-spin quantum sensor
Authors: C. Ding, M. L. Palm, K. Kohli, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, C. L. Degen
Abstract: Magnetotransport underlines many important phenomena in condensed matter physics, such as the Hall effect and magnetoresistance (MR) effect. Thus far, most magnetotransport studies are based on bulk resistance measurements without direct access to microscopic details of the spatial transport pattern. Here, we report nanoscale imaging of magnetotransport using a scanning single-spin quantum magnetometer, which is demonstrated in a graphene-metal hybrid device at room temperature. By visualizing the current flow at elevated magnetic fields (~0.5 T), we directly observe the Lorentz deflection of current near the graphene-metal interface, which is a hallmark of magnetotransport. Combining the local current distribution with global resistance measurements, we reveal that transport properties of the hybrid are governed by a complex interplay of intrinsic MR around the Dirac cone, carrier hydrodynamics, interface resistance, and the nanoscale device geometry. Furthermore, accessing the local transport pattern across the interface enables quantitative mapping of spatial variations in contact resistance, which is commonly present in electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials yet non-trivial to characterize. Our work demonstrates the potential of nanoscale current imaging techniques for studying complex electronic transport phenomena that are difficult to probe by resistance-based measurements.

Title: Effect of Misfit and Threading Dislocations on Surface Energies of PbTe-PbSe Interfaces
Authors: Emir Bilgili, Nicholas Taormina, Yang Li, Adrian Diaz, Simon R. Phillpot, Youping Chen
Abstract: The manufacturing processes of heterostructures determine the structure and properties of their interfaces. In this work, we simulate PbTe and PbSe heterostructures manufactured via (1) direct wave bonding and (2) heteroepitaxial growth. The former contains interfaces with 2D misfit dislocation networks while the latter contains complex 3D networks with both misfit and threading dislocations. To compute the surface energy of interfaces, we measure the interaction energy across surfaces using a well-verified code. Compared with hypothetical interfaces modeled to be coherent, a typical assumption in traditional slab-based methods, the surface energy of wafer bonded and epitaxially grown interfaces are significantly different. Semi-coherent interfaces exhibit up to ~27% lower surface energies than coherent ones, while coherent models overestimate surface energies by up to ~50% relative to epitaxial interfaces. The consequence of such differences can lead to conflicting predictions of physical phenomena such as fracture toughness or growth mode.

Title: A Strain-Engineered 0D/1D Heterojunction of InVO4/Cu-TbFeO3 for High- Selectivity CO2 Photoreduction
Authors: Muneeb ur Rahman
Abstract: The catalytic CO2 photoreduction to CO is significantly hindered by the pervasive kinetic bottleneck of *CO-desorption and inefficient charge separation. Surpassing the conventional single photocatalytic strategy, herein, a multi-synergetic 0D/1D S-scheme heterojunction by precisely assembling 0D InVO4 nanoparticles on 1D Cu-doped TbFeO3 (IVO/CTFO). This nano-heterojunction is rationally designed at multiple steps where Cu2+ substitution at the Fe3+ site induces a compression in lattice strain and oxygen vacancies (VO), acting as electron traps and CO2 chemisorption sites, which breaks spin-polarization of pristine TbFeO3 to facilitate multichannel charge flow. The 0D/1D strategy couples the maximum surface active-sites and short charge diffusion routes with directional charge migration. Moreover, a 0D/1D lattice mismatch creates a built-in electric field at the interface, resulting in an enhanced lifetime (64.70 ns) of charged species, an efficient CO yield (65.75 mmole g-1.h-1), and high selectivity (95.93%). DFT calculations and experimental findings confirmed the Fermi level shift toward the conduction band and the existence of spin-hybridization. Operando-DRIFTS and the free-energy diagram unveil a H+ mediated mechanism at the interface, alongside a reduction in energy barrier for CO2 photoreduction from *COOH to *CO. Thus, this study presents an excellent approach that integrates defect-engineering, strain-compression, and interfacial design in advancing solar fuels production.

Title: Domain Walls and Defects in Ferroelectric Inorganic Halide Perovskites CsGeX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I)
Authors: Kristoffer Eggestad, Benjamin A. D. Williamson, Sverre M. Selbach
Abstract: Among all-inorganic halide perovskites, the only known ferroelectrics are the family of CsGeX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I). Here, we study their ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) and common point defects by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and investigate the interplay between DWs and defects. The most stable defects are V$_{\text{X}}$ and V$_{\text{Cs}}$ and the former shows low migration barriers and high mobility. In contrast to oxide ferroelectrics, the affinity between point defects and DWs is negligible, reflecting the subtle structural distortions at CsGeX$_3$ DWs. Concomitantly, the formation energies and migration energy barriers of CsGeX$_3$ DWs are small compared to oxides, and neither V$_{\text{X}}$ nor V$_{\text{Cs}}$ pin migrating DWs. The band gap invariance across DWs and the lack of affinity towards intrinsic charged point defects imply that conducting DWs for nanoelectronics may be challenging to realise in CsGeX$_3$. However, shallow $p$-type defect levels and low hole effective masses suggest that high $p$-type conductivity may be achievable in nominally ferroelectric CsGeX$_3$. The low DW migration energy barriers and insignificant DW pinning by point defects make CsGeX$_3$ promising materials as robust soft ferroelectrics for high-frequency switching applications with low energy dissipation.

Title: Controlling Quantum Transport in a Superconducting Device via Dissipative Baths
Authors: S. V. Aksenov, M. S. Shustin, I. S. Burmistrov
Abstract: Within the quantum field-theoretical approach describing the evolution of a quadratic Liouvillian in the basis of Keldysh contour coherent states, we investigate the spectral and transport properties of a dissipative superconducting system coupled to normal Fermi reservoirs. We derive a generalization of the Meir-Wingreen formula and Onsager matrix for a superconducting system subject to an arbitrary number of fermionic baths. Following Kirchhoff's rule, we obtain an expression describing the dissipation induced loss current and formulate modified quantum kinetic equations. For wide-band contacts locally coupled to individual sites, we find that each contact reduces the degeneracy multiplicity of the non-equilibrium steady state by one. These results are numerically verified through several cases of the extended Kitaev model at symmetric points with a single contact. Furthermore, in the linear response regime at low temperatures, we demonstrate that (non-)degenerate non-equilibrium steady states correspond to (non-)quantized conductance peaks. Revisiting a paradigmatic problem of resonant transport in the Majorana mode of the Kitaev model we demonstrate that the dissipation accounts for the zero-bias peak suppression and its asymmetry.

Title: Relaxation time for competing short- and long-range interactions in the model A dynamic universality class
Authors: Jean-François de Kemmeter, Stefano Ruffo, Stefano Gherardini
Abstract: We study the relaxation dynamics at criticality in the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ Nagle-Kardar model, where short- and long-range interactions can compete. The phase diagram of this model shows lines of first and second-order phase transitions, separated by a tricritical point. We consider Glauber dynamics, focusing on the slowing-down of the magnetization $m$ both along the critical line and at the tricritical point. Starting from the master equation and performing a coarse-graining procedure, we obtain a Fokker-Planck equation for $m$ and the fraction of defects. Using central manifold theory, we analytically show that $m$ decays asymptotically as $t^{-1/2}$ along the critical line, and as $t^{-1/4}$ at the tricritical point. This result implies that the dynamical critical exponent is $z=2$, proving that the macroscopic critical dynamics of the Nagle-Kardar model falls within the dynamic universality class of purely relaxational dynamics with a non-conserved order parameter (model A). Large deviation techniques enable us to show that the average first passage time between local equilibrium states follows an Arrhenius law.

Title: Kondo cloud conductance in cavity-coupled quantum dots with asymmetric barriers
Authors: D. Fossion, V. Champain, S. Mohapatra, A. Cavanna, U. Gennser, D. Mailly, B. Hackens, L. Jansen, X. Jehl, S. De Franceschi, B. Brun-Barrière, H. Sellier
Abstract: The Kondo effect emerges when a localized spin is screened by conduction electrons, giving rise to a strongly-correlated many-body ground state. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot, focusing on the spatial extension of the Kondo screening cloud in the electron reservoirs. To probe its properties, the dot is coupled to an electronic Fabry-Pérot interferometer, enabling controlled modulation of the density of states at the Fermi level. The observation of Kondo temperature oscillations indicates a Kondo screening length comparable to the cavity size. Furthermore, we explore how the coupling asymmetry with the two reservoirs affects both the amplitude and the phase of the conductance oscillations, revealing a subtle interplay between coherent transport and Kondo effect.

Title: A Fast, Accurate, and Reactive Equivariant Foundation Potential
Authors: Tsz Wai Ko, Runze Liu, Adesh Rohan Mishra, Zihan Yu
Abstract: Electrostatics govern charge transfer and reactivity in materials. Yet, most foundation potentials (FPs) either do not explicitly model such interactions or pay a prohibitive scaling penalty to do so. Here, we introduce charge-equilibrated TensorNet (QET), an equivariant, charge-aware architecture that attains linear scaling with system size via an analytically solvable charge-equilibration scheme. We demonstrate that a trained QET FP matches state-of-the-art FPs on standard materials property benchmarks but delivers qualitatively different predictions in systems dominated by charge transfer. The QET FP reproduces the correct structure and density of the NaCl-CaCl2 ionic liquid, which charge-agnostic FPs miss. We further show that a fine-tuned QET captures reactive processes at the Li/Li6PS5Cl solid-electrolyte interface and supports simulations under applied electrochemical potentials. These results remove a fundamental constraint in the atomistic simulation of accurate electrostatics at scale and establish a general, data-driven framework for charge-aware FPs with transformative applications in energy storage, catalysis, and beyond.

Title: Machine Learning Green's Functions of Strongly Correlated Hubbard Models
Authors: Mateo Cárdenes Wuttig
Abstract: We demonstrate that a machine learning framework based on kernel ridge regression can encode and predict the self-energy of one-dimensional Hubbard models using only mean-field features such as static and dynamic Hartree-Fock quantities and first-order GW calculations. This approach is applicable across a wide range of on-site Coulomb interaction strengths $U/t$, ranging from weakly interacting systems ($U/t \ll 1$) to strong correlations ($U/t > 8$). The predicted self-energy is transformed via Dyson's equation and analytic continuation to obtain the real-frequency Green's function, which allows access to the spectral function and density of states. This method can be used for nearest-neighbor interactions $t$ and long-range hopping terms $t'$, $t''$, and $t'''$.

Title: From Fresh to Salty: How Ions Modulate Solvent-Mediated Interactions between Grafted Silica Nanoparticles in Water
Authors: Yuvraj Singh, Chandan K. Choudhury, Rakesh S. Singh
Abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) are fundamental building blocks for engineering functional soft materials, where precise control over the solvent-mediated inter-particle effective interaction (Ueff) is essential for tailoring bulk structure and properties. These solvent-mediated interactions are strongly influenced by NP's surface chemistry, solvent properties, and thermodynamic conditions such as temperature (T) and pressure (P). However, despite considerable progress, a general predictive framework for tuning Ueff and guiding self-assembly remains lacking. In this work, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the alteration of Ueff between silica nanoparticles (Si-NPs) functionalized with polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) by salt (sodium chloride) across a range of thermodynamic conditions. At ambient thermodynamic conditions, bare (not functionalized) Si-NPs exhibit minimal variation in Ueff even at high salt concentrations. In contrast, PE-grafted Si-NPs display strong salt-induced attractions, while PEG-grafted Si-NPs show an intermediate, more gradual response. To asses the transferability of these salt-induced effects on effective interactions, we further examined the effects of salt on Ueff under different (T,P) conditions. Our results indicate that the salt-induced modulation of Ueff between both bare and grafted Si-NPs is largely invariant across the explored (T,P) conditions. Molecular-level analysis reveals that salt promotes solvent depletion within the interparticle cavity for both hydrophobic PE and hydrophilic PEG grafts, with the strongest effect observed in the PE case. In general, this study highlights the coupled roles of surface chemistry, ion-polymer interactions, and solvent structuring in the regulation of Ueff, and provides important insights into the predictable control of interparticle interactions for soft material engineering.

Title: Oxygen vacancies in vanadium dioxide: A DFT$+V$ study
Authors: Oskar Leibnitz, Peter Mlkvik, Nicola A. Spaldin, Claude Ederer
Abstract: We present a density-functional theory study of the effects of oxygen vacancies on the structural and electronic properties of vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$). Our motivation is the reported suppression of the metal-insulator transition by oxygen vacancies and the lack of a clear consensus on its origin. We use the DFT$+V$ method with a static intersite vanadium-vanadium interaction term, $V$, to calculate the properties of the oxygen-deficient metallic rutile and insulating monoclinic M1 phases of VO$_2$ on the same footing. We find that oxygen vacancies induce local distortions in the M1 phase, but do not destroy the dimerization usually associated with the insulating behavior. In spite of this, we find that the M1 phase becomes metallic as a result of the partial filling of the conduction band due to a rigid-band-like doping effect.

Title: Thermal Tensor Network Simulations of Fermions with a Fixed Filling
Authors: Qiaoyi Li, Dai-Wei Qu, Bin-Bin Chen, Tao Shi, Wei Li
Abstract: Numerical simulations of strongly correlated fermions at finite temperature are essential for studying high-temperature superconductivity and other quantum many-body phenomena. The recently developed tangent-space tensor renormalization group (tanTRG) provides an efficient and accurate framework by representing thermal density operators as matrix product operators. However, the particle number generally varies during the cooling process. The conventional strategy of fine-tuning chemical potentials to reach a target filling is computationally demanding. Here we propose a fixed-$N$ tanTRG algorithm that stabilizes the average particle number by adaptively tuning the chemical potential within the imaginary-time evolution. We benchmark its accuracy on exactly solvable free fermions, and further apply it to the square-lattice Hubbard model. For hole-doped cases, we study the temperature evolution of charge and spin correlations, identifying several characteristic temperature scales for stripe formation. Our results establish fixed-$N$ tanTRG as an efficient and reliable tool for finite-temperature studies of correlated fermion systems.

Title: Persistence of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition with long-range couplings
Authors: Luis Walther, Josef Willsher, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is an archetypal example of a topological phase transition, which is driven by the proliferation of vortices. In this Letter, we analyze the persistence of the BKT transition in the XY model under the influence of long-range algebraically decaying interactions of the form $\sim 1/{r^{2+\sigma}}$. The model hosts a magnetized low temperature phase for sufficiently small $\sigma$. Crucially, in the presence of long-range interactions, spin waves renormalize the interaction between vortices, which stabilizes the BKT transition. As a result, we find that there is no direct transition from the magnetized to the disordered phase and that the BKT transition persists for arbitrary long-range exponents, which is distinct from previous results. We use both Landau-Peierls-type arguments and renormalization group calculations - including a coupling between spin wave and topological excitations - and obtain similar results. We emphasize that Landau-Peierls-type arguments are a powerful tool for analyzing continuous spin models. We discuss the relevance of our findings for current Rydberg atom experiments, and highlight the importance of long-range couplings for other types of topological defects.

Title: Optically-Induced Faraday-Goldstone Waves
Authors: Daniel Kaplan, Pavel A. Volkov, Andrea Cavalleri, Premala Chandra
Abstract: Faraday waves, typically observed in driven fluids, result from the confluence of nonlinearity and parametric amplification. Here we show that optical pulses can generate analogous phenomena that persist much longer than the pump time-scales in ordered quantum solids. We present a theory of ultrafast light-matter interactions within a symmetry-broken state; dynamical nonlinear coupling between the Higgs (amplitude) and the Goldstone (phase) modes drives an emergent phason texture that oscillates in space and in time: Faraday-Goldstone waves. Calculated signatures of this spatiotemporal order compare well with measurements on K$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$; Higgs-Goldstone beating, associated with coherent energy exchange between these two modes, is also predicted. We show this light-generated crystalline state is robust to thermal noise, even when the original Goldstone mode is not. Our results offer a new pathway for the design of periodic structures in quantum materials with ultrafast light pulses.

Title: Characterizing Mott Insulators in the Interacting One-Body Picture
Authors: Theo N. Dionne, Santiago Villodre, Mikel Iraola, Maia G. Vergniory
Abstract: We present a framework to characterize Mott insulating phases within the interacting one-body picture, focusing on the Hubbard diamond chain featuring both Hubbard interactions and spin-orbit coupling simulated within cellular dynamical mean field theory. Using symmetry analysis of the single-particle Green's function, we classify spectral functions by irreducible representations at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Complementarily, we calculate the one-body reduced density matrix which allows us to reach both a qualitative description of charge distribution and an analysis of the state purity. Moreover, within the Tensor Network framework, we employ a Density Matrix Renormalization Group approach to confirm the presence of three distinct phases and their corresponding phase transitions. Our results highlight how symmetry-labelled spectral functions and effective orbital analysis provide accessible single-particle tools for probing correlation-driven insulating phases.

Title: Weak localization and universal conductance fluctuations in large area twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Spenser Talkington, Debarghya Mallick, An-Hsi Chen, Benjamin F. Mead, Seong-Jun Yang, Cheol-Joo Kim, Shaffique Adam, Liang Wu, Matthew Brahlek, Eugene J. Mele
Abstract: We study diffusive magnetotransport in highly p-doped large area twisted bilayer graphene samples as a function of twist angle, crossing from 1° (below), to 20° (above) the van Hove singularity with 7° and 9° samples near the van Hove singularity. We report weak localization in twisted bilayer graphene for the first time. All samples exhibit weak localization, from which we extract the phase coherence length and intervalley scattering lengths, and from that determine that dephasing is caused by electron-electron scattering and intervalley scattering is caused by point defects. We observe signatures of universal conductance fluctuations in the 9° sample, which has high mobility and is near the van Hove singularity. Further improvements in sample quality and applications to large area moire materials will open new avenues to observe quantum interference effects.

Abstract: By laser pump-probe time-resolved coherent magnetic X-ray diffraction imaging, we have measured the migration velocity of antiferromagnetic domain walls in the Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 at 100 K. During the laser-induced demagnetization, we observe domain walls moving at 3x10^6 m/s, significantly faster than acoustic velocities. This is understood to arise from a purely electronic spin contribution to the magnetic structure without any role for coupling to the crystal lattice.

Title: Machine-Learning Accelerated Calculations of Reduced Density Matrices
Authors: Awwab A. Azam, Lexu Zhao, Jiabin Yu
Abstract: $n$-particle reduced density matrices ($n$-RDMs) play a central role in understanding correlated phases of matter. Yet the calculation of $n$-RDMs is often computationally inefficient for strongly-correlated states, particularly when the system sizes are large. In this work, we propose to use neural network (NN) architectures to accelerate the calculation of, and even predict, the $n$-RDMs for large-size systems. The underlying intuition is that $n$-RDMs are often smooth functions over the Brillouin zone (BZ) (certainly true for gapped states) and are thus interpolable, allowing NNs trained on small-size $n$-RDMs to predict large-size ones. Building on this intuition, we devise two NNs: (i) a self-attention NN that maps random RDMs to physical ones, and (ii) a Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) that directly maps momentum-space coordinates to RDM values. We test the NNs in three 2D models: the pair-pair correlation functions of the Richardson model of superconductivity, the translationally-invariant 1-RDM in a four-band model with short-range repulsion, and the translation-breaking 1-RDM in the half-filled Hubbard model. We find that a SIREN trained on a $6\times 6$ momentum mesh can predict the $18\times 18$ pair-pair correlation function with a relative accuracy of $0.839$. The NNs trained on $6\times 6 \sim 8\times 8$ meshes can provide high-quality initial guesses for $50\times 50$ translation-invariant Hartree-Fock (HF) and $30\times 30$ fully translation-breaking-allowed HF, reducing the number of iterations required for convergence by up to $91.63\%$ and $92.78\%$, respectively, compared to random initializations. Our results illustrate the potential of using NN-based methods for interpolable $n$-RDMs, which might open a new avenue for future research on strongly correlated phases.

Abstract: Experimental and theoretical studies of unusual polar, dielectric and magnetic properties of room temperature multiferroics, such as perovskites Pb(Fe1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PFN) and Pb(Fe1/2Ta1/2)O3 (PFT), are very important. We study the phase composition, dielectric, ferroic properties of the solid solutions PFN and PFT substituted with 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 % of Mn ions prepared by the solid-state synthesis. The XRD analysis confirmed the perovskite structure of sintered ceramics. Electric measurements revealed the ferroelectric-type hysteresis of electric charge in pure PFN ceramics and in PFN ceramics substituted with (10 - 30)% of Mn. At the same time, the PFN-5% Mn ceramics did not show any ferroelectric properties due to very high this http URL dependences of the dielectric permittivity of PFN-10% Mn and PFN-15% Mn ceramics have two pronounced maxima, one of which is relatively sharp and has a weak frequency dispersion; another is diffuse and has a strong frequency dispersion. A further increase in the Mn content up to 20% leads to the right shift in the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition temperature, as well as to the strong suppression of the second wide maximum, which transforms into a small diffuse shoulder. An increase in the Mn substitution up to 30% leads to a significant decrease in the dielectric permittivity, left shift of its maximum, and induces a pronounced frequency dispersion of the paraelectric-ferroelectric transition temperature, which is inherent to relaxor-like this http URL of the model with experiments reveal the coexistence of the ordered ferroelectric-like and disordered relaxor-like phases in the multiferroic solid solutions PFN-Mn and PFT-Mn.

Title: The ideal limit of rhombohedral graphene: Interaction-induced layer-skyrmion lattices and their collective excitations
Authors: Tixuan Tan, Patrick J. Ledwith, Trithep Devakul
Abstract: We introduce an ideal limit of rhombohedral graphene multilayers. In this limit, we show analytically how short-range repulsion stabilizes a layer-pseudospin skyrmion lattice, which generates an effective magnetic field and gives rise to a Chern band. This establishes the real-space origin of interaction-driven topology in moiré rhombohedral graphene. The resulting interaction-induced skyrmion lattice is physically analogous to magnetic skyrmion crystals and hosts a hierarchy of collective excitations naturally described within the framework of skyrmion-lattice dynamics.

Title: Topological and Trivial Valence-Bond Orders in Higher-Spin Kitaev Models
Authors: Xing-Yu Zhang, Qi Yang, Philippe Corboz, Jutho Haegeman, Yuchi He
Abstract: We investigate the quantum phases of higher-spin Kitaev models using tensor network methods. Our results reveal distinct bond-ordered phases for spin-1, spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$, and spin-2 models. In all cases, we find translational symmetry breaking with unit cells being tripled by forming valence-bond orders. However, these three phases are distinct, forming plaquette order, topological dimer order, and non-topological dimer order, respectively. Our findings are based on a cross-validation between variational two-dimensional tensor network calculations: an unrestricted exploration of symmetry-broken states versus the detection of symmetry breaking from cat-state behavior in symmetry-restricted states. The origin of different orders can also be understood from a theoretical analysis. Our work sheds light upon the interplay between topological and symmetry-breaking orders as well as their detection via tensor networks.

Title: YAP+: Pad-Layout-Aware Yield Modeling and Simulation for Hybrid Bonding
Authors: Zhichao Chen, Puneet Gupta
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) integration continues to advance Moore's Law by facilitating dense interconnects and enabling multi-tier system architectures. Among the various integration approaches, Cu-Cu hybrid bonding has emerged as a leading solution for achieving high interconnect density in chiplet integration. In this work, we present YAP+, a yield modeling framework specifically tailored for wafer-to-wafer (W2W) and die-to-wafer (D2W) hybrid bonding processes. YAP+ incorporates a comprehensive set of yield-impacting failure mechanisms, including overlay misalignment, particle defects, Cu recess variations, surface roughness, and Cu pad density. Furthermore, YAP+ supports pad layout-aware yield analysis, considering critical, redundant, and dummy pads across arbitrary 2D physical layout patterns. To support practical evaluation, we developed an open-source yield simulator, demonstrating that our near-analytical model matches simulation accuracy while achieving over 1,000x speedup in runtime. This performance makes YAP+ a valuable tool for co-optimizing packaging technologies, assembly design rules, and system-level design strategies. Beyond W2W-D2W comparisons, we leverage YAP+ to investigate the impact of pad layout patterns, bonding pitch, and pad ratios across different pad types, and explore the benefits of strategically placing redundant pad replicas.

Title: Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Membrane Selectivity of Star Peptides Across Different Bacterial and Mammalian Bilipids
Authors: Amal Jayawardena, Andrew Hung, Greg Qiao, Neil OBrien-Simpson, Elnaz Hajizadeh
Abstract: Structurally nanoengineered antimicrobial peptide polymers (SNAPPs) are emerging as promising selective agents against bacterial membranes. In this study, we used all atom molecular dynamics simulation techniques to investigate the interaction of a promising cationic SNAPP architecture (Alt-SNAPP with 8 arms made of alternating lysine and valine residues) with modelled Gram-negative, Gram-positive, mammalian, and red blood cell membranes. Alt-SNAPP exhibited rapid and stable binding to bacterial membranes, driven by electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), and supported by membrane fluidity. In contrast, mammalian and red blood cell membranes, enriched in zwitterionic lipids and cholesterol, resisted peptide association entirely. Analyses of center of mass distance, partial density, hydrogen bonding, and interaction energy confirmed that SNAPP remains fully excluded from host like membranes while forming stable, multivalent interactions with bacterial bilayers. These findings provide mechanistic insight into membrane selectivity of SNAPP and offer a molecular framework for designing next generation antimicrobial polymers with minimal off target toxicity.

Title: Fine-Tuning Vision-Language Models for Multimodal Polymer Property Prediction
Authors: An Vuong, Minh-Hao Van, Prateek Verma, Chen Zhao, Xintao Wu
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in tasks like visual question answering and multimodal text generation, but their effectiveness in scientific domains such as materials science remains limited. While some machine learning methods have addressed specific challenges in this field, there is still a lack of foundation models designed for broad tasks like polymer property prediction using multimodal data. In this work, we present a multimodal polymer dataset to fine-tune VLMs through instruction-tuning pairs and assess the impact of multimodality on prediction performance. Our fine-tuned models, using LoRA, outperform unimodal and baseline approaches, demonstrating the benefits of multimodal learning. Additionally, this approach reduces the need to train separate models for different properties, lowering deployment and maintenance costs.

Title: Gas Mixture Diffusion and Distribution in the Porous ZIF-90 Framework
Authors: Ashok Yacham, Tarak K. Patra, Jithin John Varghese
Abstract: Understanding how gas mixtures diffuse and distribute within porous frameworks is central to designing advanced separation and storage materials. Here, we investigate the transport and spatial distribution of binary gas mixtures in a porous metal organic framework, viz., ZIF-90, using molecular simulations. We perform grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to examine the competitive adsorption of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from a binary gas mixture in ZIF-90, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are conducted to investigate the transport behavior of the adsorbed molecules within the framework. These integrated simulations reveal that the framework topology and pore chemistry jointly dictate diffusion pathways and preferential occupancy of gas species, underscoring their intrinsic interdependence. Competitive adsorption leads to distinct spatial partitioning within the pores, which in turn modulates mixture diffusivity inside the porous medium compared to their bulk properties. Our results provide molecular-level insight into how ZIF-90 accommodates and separates gas mixtures, offering design principles for optimizing metal-organic frameworks in energy and environmental applications.

Title: Stability theory of flat band solitons in nonlinear wave systems
Authors: Cheng Shi, Ross Parker, Panayotis G. Kevrekides, Michael I. Weinstein
Abstract: We establish a sharp criterion for the stability of a class of compactly supported, homogeneous density``minimal compact solitons'' or MCS states, of the time-dependent discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation on a multi-lattice, $\mathbb L$ ($\mathbb L$-DNLS). MCS states arise for multi-lattices where a nearest neighbor Laplace-type operator on $\mathbb L$ has a flat band. Our stability criterion is in terms of the explicit form of the nonlinearity and the projection of distinguished vectors onto the flat band eigenspace. We apply our general results to MCS states of DNLS for the diamond, Kagom{é} and checkerboard lattices. In lattices where MCS states are unstable, we demonstrate how to engineer the nonlinearity to stabilize small amplitude MCS states. Finally, via systematic numerical computations, we put our analytical results in the context of global bifurcation diagrams.

Title: Dual holography as functional renormalization group
Authors: Ki-Seok Kim, Arpita Mitra, Debangshu Mukherjee, Seung-Jong Yoo
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the functional renormalization group (RG) and the dual holography framework in the path integral formulation, highlighting how each can be understood as a manifestation of the other. Rather than employing the conventional functional RG formalism, we consider a functional RG equation for the probability distribution function, where the RG flow is governed by a Fokker-Planck-type equation. The central idea is to reformulate the solution of Fokker-Planck type functional RG equation in a path integral representation. Within the semiclassical approximation, this leads to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for an effective renormalized on-shell action. We then examine our framework for an Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a scalar field. Applying standard techniques, we derive a corresponding functional RG equation for the distribution function, where the dual holographic path integral serves as its formal solution. By synthesizing these two perspectives, we propose a generalized dual holography framework in which the RG flow is explicitly incorporated into the bulk effective action. This generalization naturally introduces RG $\beta$-functions and reveals that the RG flow of the distribution function is essentially identical to that of the functional RG equation.

Title: Unveiling architectural and optoelectronic synergies in lead-free perovskite/perovskite/kesterite triple-junction monolithic tandem solar cells
Authors: Md. Faiaad Rahman, Md. Ashaduzzaman Niloy, Ehsanur Rahmana, Ahmed Zubair
Abstract: The widespread use of lead-based materials in tandem solar cells raises critical environmental and health concerns due to their inherent toxicity and risk of contamination. To address this challenge, we focused on lead-free tandem architectures based on non-toxic, environmentally benign materials such as tin-based perovskites and kesterites, which are essential for advancing sustainable photovoltaic technologies. In this study, we present the proposition, design, and optimization of two distinct lead-free monolithic tandem solar cell architectures - an all-perovskite dual-junction device employing potassium tin iodide (KSnI3) and formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) as absorbers for the top and bottom subcells, respectively, and a triple-junction monolithic tandem structure incorporating KSnI3, FASnI3, and Ag-doped copper zinc tin selenide (ACZTSe) as absorbers for the top, middle, and bottom subcells, respectively. We simulated the optical and electrical characteristics of these devices using the finite-difference time-domain and finite element methods, explicitly considering radiative, non-radiative, and surface recombination mechanisms. The optimized all-perovskite dual-junction solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 27.3%, with short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.74 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 2.227 V, and fill factor (FF) of 83.14%. Conversely, the optimized triple-junction hybrid perovskite-kesterite architecture secured an elevated PCE of 30.69%, along with Jsc of 13.184 mA/cm2, Voc of 2.766 V, and FF of 84.18%. These findings reveal the strong potential of lead-free perovskite and kesterite material based absorbers in promoting high-performance hybrid tandem solar cells, highlighting their importance in advancing sustainable and efficient photovoltaic technologies.

Title: Converting coherence into work with a fully quantum engine
Authors: MinSik Kwon, Tobias Denzler, Rouven Maier, Vadim Vorobyov, Durga Bhaktavatsala Rao Dasari, Eric Lutz, Jörg Wrachtrup
Abstract: Heat engines convert thermal energy into mechanical work. We here report the experimental realization of a fully quantum engine that converts quantum coherence into work. A single solid-state spin in diamond is fueled by a coherent bath and cyclically stores energy in a spin quantum battery. We establish quantum-enhanced performance by showing that almost 200$\%$ more work is produced after a few cycle compared to the corresponding classical engine. We obtain concrete criteria for successful coherence-to-work conversion, and highlight the importance of a coherent motor-battery interaction. This device harnesses nonclassical features during all stages of its cycle, and demonstrates the functionality of a nanomachine whose parts are all quantum coherent.

Title: Two variants of the friendship paradox: The condition for inequality between them
Authors: Sang Hoon Lee
Abstract: The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the "alter-based" and "ego-based" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This document establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.

Title: Chiral Anomaly of Kogut-Susskind Fermion in (3+1)-dimensional Hamiltonian formalism
Authors: Shoto Aoki, Yoshio Kikukawa, Toshinari Takemoto
Abstract: We consider Kogut-Susskind fermions (also known as staggered fermions) in a $(3+1)$-dimensional Hamiltonian formalism and examine a chiral transformation and its associated chiral anomaly. The Hamiltonian of the massless Kogut-Susskind fermion has symmetry under the shift transformations in each space direction $S_k \, (k=1,2,3)$, and the product of the three shift transformations in particular (the odd shifts in general) may be regarded as a unitary discrete chiral transformation, modulo two-site translations. The hermitian part of the transformation kernel $\Gamma = i S_1 S_2 S_3$ can define an axial charge as $Q_A = (1/2)\sum_x \chi^\dagger(x) \left(\Gamma+\Gamma^\dagger \right)\chi(x)$, which is non-onsite, nonquantized, and commutative with the vector charge, analogous to $\tilde{Q}_A = (1/2) \sum_n ( \chi^\dagger_n \chi_{n+1} + \chi^\dagger_{n+1} \chi_{n} )$ for the $(1+1)$ dimensional Kogut-Susskind fermion. However, our $Q_A$ cannot be expressed in terms of any quantized charges in a generalized Onsager algebra. Although $Q_A$ does not commute with the fermion Hamiltonian in general when coupled to background link gauge fields, we show that they become commutative for a class of $U(1)$ link configurations carrying nontrivial magnetic and electric fields. We then verify numerically that the vacuum expectation value of $Q_A$ satisfies the anomalous conservation law of axial charge in the continuum two-flavor theory under an adiabatic evolution of the link gauge field.

Title: A Bilayer Cathode Design Procedure for Li ion Batteries Using the Multilayer Doyle-Fuller-Newman Model (M-DFN)
Authors: E. C. Tredenick, A. M. Boyce, R. Drummond, S. R. Duncan
Abstract: Heterogeneities in lithium ion batteries can be significant factors in electrode under utilisation and degradation while charging. Bilayer electrodes have been proposed as a convenient and scalable way to homogenise the electrode response. In this paper, the design of a bilayer cathode for Li-ion batteries composed of separate layers of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC622) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) is optimised using the multilayer Doyle-Fuller-Newman (M-DFN) model. Changes to the carbon binder domain, electrolyte volume fraction, and tortuosity provided the greatest control for improving Li-ion charge mobility. The optimised bilayer design was able to charge at 3C between 0-90% SOC in 18.6 minutes, achieving 4.4 mAh/cm2. Comparing the optimal bilayer to the LFP-only electrode, the bilayer achieved 41% higher capacity. Through mechanistic physics-based modelling, it was shown that the 3C charging improvement of the optimised bilayer was achieved by enabling a more homogeneous current density distribution through the thickness of the electrode and electrolyte depletion prevention. The findings were confirmed on a high-fidelity X-ray computed tomography (CT) based microstructural model. The results illustrate how modelling can be used to rapidly search novel electrode designs

Title: Global Buckley--Leverett for Multicomponent Flow in Fractured Media: Isothermal Equation-of-State Coupling and Dynamic Capillarity
Authors: Christian Tantardini, Fernando Alonso-Marroquin
Abstract: We present an isothermal Global Buckley--Leverett framework for multicomponent, multiphase flow in porous and fractured media that retains the interpretability of classical Buckley--Leverett while incorporating essential physics: equation of state-based phase behavior, multicomponent Maxwell--Stefan diffusion, dynamic capillarity, stress-sensitive permeability, and non-Darcy fracture flow. The formulation yields a single global-pressure equation driving the total Darcy flux and an exact fractional-flow decomposition of phase velocities with buoyancy and capillary drifts; inertial effects enter as per-phase damping that renormalizes mobilities. Crucially, the combination of Maxwell--Stefan diffusion and dynamic capillarity renders transport pseudo-parabolic, resolving the loss of strict hyperbolicity that plagues three-phase Buckley--Leverett and ensuring a well-posed initial-value problem. In practice, each time step solves the scalar global-pressure equation, reconstructs phase fluxes via the split, and advances strictly conservative component balances; axisymmetric (cylindrical) forms for radial injection with vertical buoyancy are provided. The model reduces exactly to classical Buckley--Leverett when added physics are disabled, making it a practical backbone for carbon storage and contaminant transport in fractured, compositionally complex reservoirs.

Title: Do Discrete Fine-Scale Mechanical Models with Rotational Degrees of Freedom Homogenize Into a Cosserat or a Cauchy Continuum?
Authors: Jan Eliáš, Gianluca Cusatis
Abstract: This article answers the question of whether homogenization of discrete fine-scale mechanical models, such as particle or lattice models, gives rise to an equivalent continuum that is of Cauchy-type or Cosserat-type. The study employs the machinery of asymptotic expansion homogenization to analyze discrete mechanical models with rotational degrees of freedom commonly used to simulate the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous solids. The proposed derivation has general validity in both stationary (steady-state) and transient conditions (assuming wavelength much larger that particle size) and for arbitrary nonlinear, inelastic fine-scale constitutive equations. The results show that the unit cell problem is always stationary, and the only inertia term appears in the linear momentum balance equation at the coarse scale. Depending on the magnitude of the local bending stiffness, mathematical homogenization rigorously identifies two limiting conditions that correspond to the Cauchy continuum and the Cosserat continuum. A heuristic combination of these two limiting conditions provides very accurate results also in the transition from one limiting case to the other. Finally, the study demonstrates that cases for which the Cosserat character of the homogenized response is significant are associated with non-physically high fine-scale bending stiffness and, as such, are of no interest in practice.

Title: Spontaneous emission of a three-level artificial atom in a one-dimensional open waveguide
Authors: Oleg. A. Chuikin, Yakov Greenberg, Oleg Kibis
Abstract: We study the dynamical and spectral characteristics of a quantum three-level ladder system, interacting with a continuous electromagnetic field in one-dimensional open waveguide. Common realization of such systems is a waveguide QED setup ~ -- a superconducting artificial atom (transmon), coupled to an open microwave transmission line. We derive an analytical solution for spontaneous emission of initially excited atom, and use it to study the probability of state detection and spectral density of output photon states. We find that for strong coupling of transmon to a waveguide emitted photons show correlation in frequency and can have the same energies, even if the three-level system is anharmonic.

Title: Modeling the precipitation distribution by radius and pore size during drying of an impregnated sphere
Authors: N.V. Peskov
Abstract: The process of preparing heterogeneous catalysts on porous supports includes a drying stage, in which the porous material, impregnated with an aqueous solution of the catalyst precursor, is dried, and the precursor is precipitated on the pore walls. The precipitate distribution throughout the support volume strongly influences the catalyst performance and durability within industrial reactors. This paper presents a mathematical model for simulating the precipitation distribution during the drying of a porous sphere. Examples of calculations are given demonstrating the influence of some parameters on the distribution by space and by pore size.17

Title: Equivalence and Divergence of Imaginary-Time Evolution and Gradient Descent for Gaussian Variational States
Authors: Yash Palan
Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution (ITE) is one of the most widely used numerical techniques for obtaining ground states of many-body Hamiltonians. In this work, we compare ITE with gradient descent (GD) within the framework of Gaussian wavefunction ansatze. We show that while ITE and GD are formally equivalent for fermionic systems, GD exhibits consistently faster convergence for bosonic systems, challenging the common assumption of their complete equivalence.

Title: Geometric Intermittency in Turbulence
Authors: Ritwik Mukherjee, Siddhartha Mukherjee, I. V. Kolokolov, V. V. Lebedev, Takeshi Matsumoto, Samriddhi Sankar Ray
Abstract: Equal-time scaling exponents in fully developed turbulence typically exhibit non anomalous scaling in the inverse cascade of two-dimensional (2D) turbulence and anomalous scaling in three dimensions. We demonstrate that multiscaling is not confined to longitudinal, scalar velocity increments, but also emerges in increments associated with the magnitude and orientation of the velocity vector. This decomposition uncovers a multiscaling in the 2D inverse cascade, which remains obscured when using conventional structure functions. Our results highlight a decoupling between velocity amplitude and flow geometry, offering new insight into the statistical structure of turbulent cascades as well as showing how different classes of multiscaling emerge.

Title: Flux-modulated tunable interaction regimes in two strongly nonlinear oscillators
Authors: J. D. Koenig, G. Barbieri, F. Fani Sani, C. A. Potts, M. Kounalakis, G. A. Steele
Abstract: The ability to efficiently simulate a variety of interacting quantum systems on a single device is an overarching goal for digital and analog quantum simulators. In circuit quantum electrodynamical systems, strongly nonlinear superconducting oscillators are typically realized using transmon qubits, featuring a wide range of tunable couplings that are mainly achieved via flux-dependent inductive elements. Such controllability is highly desirable both for digital quantum information processing and for analog quantum simulations of various physical phenomena, such as arbitrary spin-spin interactions. Furthermore, broad tunability facilitates the study of driven-dissipative oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored parameter regimes. In this work, we demonstrate the ability to selectively activate different dynamical regimes between two strongly nonlinear oscillators using parametric modulation. In particular, our scheme enables access to regimes that are dominated by photon-hopping, two-mode squeezing, or cross-Kerr interactions. Finally, we observe level repulsion and attraction between Kerr-nonlinear oscillators in regimes where the nonlinearities exceed the coupling strengths and decay rates of the system. Our results could be used for realizing purely analog quantum simulators to study arbitrary spin systems as well as for exploring strongly nonlinear oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored interaction regimes.

Title: Quantum algorithm for one quasi-particle excitations in the thermodynamic limit via cluster-additive block-diagonalization
Authors: Sumeet, M. Hörmann, K.P. Schmidt
Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for computing one quasi-particle excitation energies in the thermodynamic limit by combining numerical linked-cluster expansions (NLCEs) and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our approach uses VQE to block-diagonalize the cluster Hamiltonian through a single-unitary transformation. This unitary is then post-processed using the projective cluster-additive transformation (PCAT) to ensure cluster additivity, a key requirement for NLCE convergence. We benchmark our method on the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one and two dimensions, and with longitudinal field, computing one quasi-particle dispersions in the high-field polarized phase. We compare two cost function classes, trace minimization and variance-based, demonstrating their effectiveness with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz (HVA). For pure TFIM, $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ layers suffice: NLCE+VQE matches exact diagonalization. For TFIM with longitudinal field, where parity symmetry breaks and PCAT becomes essential, both $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ and $N$ layers converge with increasing cluster size, with $N$ layers providing improved accuracy. Our results establish PCAT as a cluster-additive framework that extends variational quantum algorithms to excited-state calculations in the thermodynamic limit via NLCE. While demonstrated with VQE, the PCAT post-processing approach, which requires only low-energy eigenspace information, applies to any quantum eigenstate preparation method.

Title: Local metamaterials and transition layers
Authors: Kimya Yadollahpour, Hossein Khodavirdi, Ankit Srivastava
Abstract: In this paper, we elucidate the concept of local acoustic metamaterials. These are composites which exhibit equi-frequency contours (EFC) which correspond to those expected of homogeneous local acoustic media. We show that EFCs for local acoustic media are conics in 2-dimension and quadrics in 3-dimension. In 2-D, the sure signature of negative properties is if the conic is a hyperbola and in 3-D, the sure signature is the presence of hyperboloids. We note that metamaterial coupling (Willis coupling) has the potential of translating these conics and quadrics in the wave-vector plane but that it does not fundamentally change the shape of these geometries. The local effective properties assigned to a composite in such cases are dispersive (frequency dependent) and they satisfy causality considerations. We finally also show that such properties truly characterize the composite in the sense that they can be used to solve scattering problems involving different samples of the composite. We show that this is made possible through the consideration of transition layers. While the sharp-interface model incurs scattering errors exceeding 20\% at oblique angles, the Drude-layer model restores agreement to within 2\% without requiring integral-equation or multi-mode expansions, thereby offering a simple yet highly efficient route to accurate scattering predictions in resonant local acoustic metamaterials.

Title: Average Winding Number for Determinantal Curves associated to 2-Matrix Models in the Class AIII
Authors: Mathieu Yahiaoui, Mario Kieburg
Abstract: To classify one-dimensional disordered quantum systems with chiral symmetry, we analyse the winding number of the determinant of a parametrized non-Hermitian random matrix field over the unit circle modelling the off-diagonal block of a disordered chiral Hamiltonian. The associated partition function is computed explicitly for a broad class of additive two-matrix models extending beyond the Ginibre Unitary Ensemble. In the large-dimension limit, we derive an asymptotic expansion of the average winding number whose leading term exhibits universal features, up to the tail behaviour of the underlying random matrix ensemble, and identify a new correction term absent in the previously studied Ginibre case.

Title: Emergent self-inhibition governs the landscape of stable states in complex ecosystems
Authors: Nitesh Kumar Patro, Washington Taylor, Akshit Goyal
Abstract: Species-rich ecosystems often exhibit multiple stable states with distinct species compositions. Yet, the factors determining the likelihood of each state's occurrence remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize and explain the landscape of stable states in the random Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model, in which multistability is widespread. We find that the same pool of species with random initial abundances can result in different stable states, whose likelihoods typically differ by orders of magnitude. A state's likelihood increases sharply with its total biomass, or inverse self-inhibition. We develop a simplified model to predict and explain this behavior, by coarse-graining ecological interactions so that each stable state behaves as a unit. In this setting, we can accurately predict the entire landscape of stable states using only two macroscopic properties: the biomass of each state and species diversity. Our theory also provides insight into the biomass-likelihood relationship: High-biomass states have low self-inhibition and thus grow faster, outcompete others, and become much more likely. These results reveal emergent self-inhibition as a fundamental organizing principle for the attractor landscape of complex ecosystems - and provide a path to predict ecosystem outcomes without knowing microscopic interactions.

Title: Dynamics of number entropy for free fermionic systems in presence of defects and stochastic processes
Authors: Atharva Naik, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla, Manas Kulkarni
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of number entropy in a chain of free fermions subjected to both defects and stochastic processes. For a special class of defects, namely conformal defects, we present analytical and numerical results for the temporal growth of number entropy, the time evolution of the number distribution, and the eigenvalue profile of the associated correlation matrix within a subsystem. We show that the number entropy exhibits logarithmic growth in time, originating from the Gaussian structure of the number distribution. We find that the eigenvalue dynamics reveal a profound connection to the reflection and transmission coefficients of the associated scattering problem for a broad range of defects. When stochastic processes are introduced, specifically Stochastic Unitary Processes (SUP) and Quantum State Diffusion (QSD), the number entropy scales as $\ln(t)$ in the SUP case and shows strong hints of $\ln [\ln(t)]$ scaling in the QSD case. These findings establish compelling evidence that number entropy grows logarithmically slower than the corresponding von Neumann entanglement entropy across a wide class of systems.

Title: Beyond the Tip: Lattice Dynamics, Seams, and the Mechanism of Microtubule Fracture
Authors: Amir Zablotsky, Subham Biswas, Laura Schaedel, Karin John
Abstract: The structural integrity of microtubules is paramount for cellular function. We present a theoretical analysis of their lattice fracture, focusing on the influence of multi-seam structures arising from monomer defects and aiming to provide a more accurate estimation of GDP lattice parameters. Our findings reveal that seams function as pre-existing pathways that accelerate damage propagation. Consequently, monomer vacancies destabilize the lattice due to the inherent structural loss of tubulin-tubulin contacts and the additive acceleration of fracture through multiple seams. Importantly, the comparison of our simulations with experiments on lattice fracture suggests that the intrinsic ratio of longitudinal to lateral binding energies is bounded at approximately 1.5, challenging previous predictions of lattice anisotropy from tip-growth models and highlighting the urgent need to incorporate into current growth models parameters obtained from lattice dynamics.

Title: Theory of Semi-discontinuous DNA Replication
Authors: Janani G, Deepak Bhat
Abstract: In biological cells, DNA replication is carried out by the replisome, a protein complex encompassing multiple DNA polymerases. DNA replication is semi-discontinuous: a DNA polymerase synthesizes one (leading) strand of the DNA continuously, and another polymerase synthesizes the other (lagging) strand discontinuously. Complex dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase within the replisome result in the formation of short interim fragments, known as Okazaki fragments, and gaps between them. Although the semi-discontinuous replication is ubiquitous, a detailed characterization of it remains elusive. In this work, we develop a framework to investigate the semi-discontinuous replication by incorporating stochastic dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase. Computing the size distribution of Okazaki fragments and gaps, we uncover the significance of the polymerase dissociation in shaping them. We apply the method to the previous experiment on the T4 bacteriophage replication system and identify the key parameters governing the polymerase dynamics. These results reveal that the collisions of lagging-strand polymerase with pre-synthesised Okazaki fragments primarily trigger its dissociation from the lagging strand.

Title: The noiseless limit and improved-prior limit of the maximum entropy method and their implications for the analytic continuation problem
Authors: Thomas Chuna, Nicholas Barnfield, Paul Hamann, Sebastian Schwalbe, Michael P. Friedlander, Tobias Dornheim
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are uniquely capable of providing exact simulations of quantum many-body systems. Unfortunately, the applications of a QMC simulation are limited because extracting dynamic properties requires solving the analytic continuation (AC) problem. Across the many fields that use QMC methods, there is no universally accepted analytic continuation algorithm for extracting dynamic properties, but many publications compare to the maximum entropy method. We investigate when entropy maximization is an acceptable approach. We show that stochastic sampling algorithms reduce to entropy maximization when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We investigate when is Bryan's controversial optimization algorithm [Bryan, Eur. Biophys. J. 18, 165-174 (1990)] for entropy maximization (sometimes known as the maximum entropy method) appropriate to use. We show that Bryan's algorithm is appropriate when the noise is near zero or when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We also investigate the mean squared error, finding a better scaling when the Bayesian prior is near the true solution than when the noise is near zero. We point to examples of improved data-driven Bayesian priors that have already leveraged this advantage. We support these results by solving the double Gaussian problem using both Bryan's algorithm and the newly formulated dual approach to entropy maximization [Chuna et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 58, 335203 (2025)].

Title: Nonlinear Thermodynamic Formalism: Mean-field Phase Transitions, Large Deviations and Bogoliubov's Variational Principle
Authors: Jean-Bernard Bru, Walter de Siqueira Pedra, Artur O. Lopes
Abstract: Let $\Omega =\{1,2,\ldots ,d\}^{\mathbb{N}}$, $T$ be the shift acting on $\Omega $, $\mathcal{P}(T)$ the set of $T$-invariant probabilities. Given a Hölder potential $A$ and a continuous function $F$, we investigate the probabilities $\rho _{F,A}$ that are maximizers of the nonlinear pressure $\mathfrak{P}_{F,A}:=\sup_{\rho \in \mathcal{P}(T)}\{ F(\int A(x)\rho (\mathrm{d}x))+h(\rho )\} .$ $\rho _{F,A}$} is called a nonlinear equilibrium; a nonlinear phase transition occurs when there is more than one. In the case $F$\ is convex or concave, we combine Varadhan's lemma and Bogoliubov's variational principle to characterize them via the linear pressure problem and self-consistency conditions. Let $\mu \in \mathcal{P}(T)$ be the maximal entropy measure, $\varphi _{n}(x)=n^{-1}(\varphi (x)+\varphi (T(x))+\cdots +\varphi (T^{n-1}(x)))$ and $\beta >0$.}\newline (I) We also consider the limit measure $\mathfrak{m}$ on $ \Omega $, so that $\forall \psi \in C(\Omega )$, $\int \psi (x)\,\mathfrak{m}\,( \mathrm{d}x)\,\,=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }\frac{\,\int \,\psi (x)\,\,\,e^{ \frac{\beta n}{2}\,\,A_{n}((x)^{2}}\,\,\mu \,(\mathrm{d}x)\,}{\int e^{\frac{ \beta n}{2}\,\,A_{n}((x)^{2}}\mu \,(\mathrm{d}x)\,\,}.$ We call $\mathfrak{m}$ a \textit{quadratic mean-field Gibbs probability (II) Via subsequences $n_{k}$, $k\in \mathbb{N}$, we study the limit measure $\mathfrak{M}$ on $\Omega $, so that $\forall \psi \in C(\Omega )$, $\int \psi (x)\mathfrak{M}(\mathrm{d} x)=\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty }\frac{\,\int \psi _{n_{k}}(x)e^{\frac{\beta n_{k}}{2}A_{n_{k}}(x)^{2}}\mu (\mathrm{d}x)}{\int e^{\frac{\beta n_{k}}{2} A_{n_{k}}(x)^{2}}\mu (\mathrm{d}x)}.$ We call $\mathfrak{M}$ a quadratic mean-field equilibrium probability; it is shift-invariant. Explicit examples are given.

Title: Biphoton state generation and engineering with bright hybrid III-V/Silicon photonic devices
Authors: Lorenzo Lazzari, Jérémie Schuhmann, Othmane Meskine, Martina Morassi, Aristide Lemaître, Maria I. Amanti, Frédéric Boeuf, Fabrice Raineri, Florent Baboux, Sara Ducci
Abstract: Hybrid photonic circuits, harnessing the complementary strengths of multiple materials, represent a key resource to enable compact, scalable platforms for quantum technologies. In particular, the availability of bright sources of tunable biphoton states is eagerly awaited to meet the variety of applications currently under development. In this work we demonstrate a heterogeneously integrated device that merges biphoton generation and on-chip quantum state engineering, combining an AlGaAs photon-pair source with a CMOS-compatible silicon-on-insulator (SOI) circuit. Photon pairs are generated in the C telecom band via spontaneous parametric down-conversion and transferred to the SOI chip through a multimode evanescent coupling scheme. This design achieves a pair generation rate above 10$^{6}$ s$^{-1}$mW$^{-1}$ and a coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to 600. Crucially, the coupling design induces strong and predictable transformations of the biphoton joint spectral amplitude, enabling complex quantum state engineering entirely on-chip in a compact device compliant with electrical pumping.

Title: A Comprehensive Approach to Finite-Bath Open Quantum Systems: Exact Dynamics
Authors: Devvrat Tiwari, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: Here, we develop the exact dynamics of the central spin model, modeling a finite-bath open quantum system. Particularly, two different types of interactions are investigated between the system and the bath: Heisenberg interaction with constant interaction strength, and a stochastic time-dependent interaction. In the former case, a new quantum channel is characterized, while the latter elucidates the microscopic understanding of a very well-known non-Markovian quantum channel. Exact master equations are provided in both scenarios. This is achieved by developing a new technique for obtaining a master equation from the map, making use of the concept of a minimal dissipator. This paves the way for a foundational understanding of finite-bath open quantum systems and a number of novel applications in the vast domain of quantum physics, one of which, implemented here, is in quantum thermodynamics.

Title: Matrix-product state skeletons in Onsager-integrable quantum chains
Authors: Imogen Camp, Nick G. Jones
Abstract: Matrix-product state (MPS) skeletons are connected networks of Hamiltonians with exact MPS ground states that underlie a phase diagram. Such skeletons have previously been found in classes of free-fermion models. For the translation-invariant BDI and AIII free-fermion classes, it has been shown that the underlying skeleton is dense, giving an analytic approach to MPS approximation of ground states anywhere in the class. In this paper, we partially expose the skeleton in certain interacting spin chains: the $N$-state Onsager-integrable chiral clock families. We construct MPS that form a dense MPS skeleton in the gapped regions surrounding a sequence of fixed-point Hamiltonians (the generators of the Onsager algebra). Outside these gapped regions, these MPS remain eigenstates, but no longer give the many-body ground state. Rather, they are ground states in particular sectors of the spectrum. Our methods also allow us to find further MPS eigenstates; these correspond to low-lying excited states within the aforementioned gapped regions. This set of MPS excited states goes beyond the previous analysis of ground states on the $N=2$ free-fermion MPS skeleton. As an application of our results, we find a closed form for the disorder parameter in a family of interacting models. Finally, we remark that many of our results use only the Onsager algebra and are not specific to the chiral clock model representation.

Title: Phases and properties of color superconductors
Authors: Andreas Schmitt
Abstract: Cold and dense matter is expected to be in a color-superconducting state. Here we review two calculations, relevant for fundamental properties and applications of color superconductivity, respectively: the weak-coupling QCD calculation of the fermionic energy gap together with the magnetic screening masses of the gauge bosons, and the calculation of bulk viscosity from a non-leptonic electroweak process. These calculations are supplemented by a discussion of color superconductors with mismatched Fermi momenta, and they are embedded in the context of the state of the art by giving an overview of previous and ongoing work and future directions.

Title: Decoupling of clusters in independent sets in a percolated hypercube
Authors: Mriganka Basu Roy Chowdhury, Shirshendu Ganguly, Vilas Winstein
Abstract: Independent sets in graphs are sets of vertices containing no neighbors, and they represent a canonical spin system with hardcore constraints. Of particular interest is the setting of the boolean hypercube, where counting independent sets was the original motivator for Sapozhenko's famous graph container method. A modern perspective on such problems is to consider the effect of disorder, and the study of independent sets in random subgraphs of the hypercube obtained via bond percolation with parameter $p$ was initiated by Kronenberg and Spinka. They employed tools from statistical mechanics to obtain detailed information about the moments of the number of independent sets (now a random variable), and posed many interesting questions. Previous work by the authors addressed many of these questions in the regime $p \geq \frac{2}{3}$, where the behavior is relatively simple and can be modeled well by a related family of independent particles. As $p$ decreases, though, typical independent sets become larger and feature more intricate clustering behavior. In the present article we overcome many of the challenges presented by this phenomenon and analyze the model for all $p> 0.465$. We obtain a sharp in-probability approximation for the number of independent sets in the percolated hypercube in terms of explicit random variables, as well as provide a sampling algorithm. Note that this shows, curiously, that $p = \frac{1}{2}$ is not a natural barrier for this problem unlike in many other problems where it appears as a point of a phase transition. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a new probabilistic framework to handle the clustering behavior for these low values of $p$. Although our analysis is restricted to $p > 0.465$, our arguments are expected to be helpful for studying this model at even lower values of $p$, and possibly for other related problems.

Title: Effect of shape on void growth: A coupled Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) and Discrete Dislocation Plasticity (DDP) study
Authors: Muhammad Usman, Sana Waheed, Aamir Mubashar
Abstract: Voids are one of the many material defects present at the microscopic length scale. They are primarily responsible for the formation of cracks and hence contribute to ductile fracture. Circular voids tend to deform into elliptical voids just before their coalescence to form cracks. The principle aim of this study is to investigate the effect of void shape on the micro-mechanism of void growth by using Discrete Dislocation Plasticity simulations. For voided crystals, conventional DDP produces a continuous slip step throughout the material even if a dislocation escapes from a non-convex domain. To overcome this issue, the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is used here to incorporate the displacement discontinuity. Different aspect ratios of elliptical voids are considered under uniaxial and biaxial deformation boundary conditions. The results suggest that voids having the largest surface area tend to have maximum growth rate as compared to void with lower surface area, i.e. "larger is faster". Under biaxial loading, a higher magnitude of strain hardening, and void growth rate are observed as compared to uniaxial loading. The results also suggest that the orientation of slip planes as well as voids, affect the overall plastic behavior of the voided-ductile material. Furthermore, circular void tends to induce minimum growth rate but have the maximum strain hardening effect as compared to other void shapes under both loading conditions. The results of this study provide a deeper understanding of ductile fracture with applications in manufacturing industry, aerospace industry and in the design of nano/micro-electromechanical devices i.e. NEMS/MEMS.

Title: Entanglement-driven responses through multiscale 3D-printed knits
Authors: Bradley Cline, Catherine Bai, Sehui Jeong, Ling Xu, Yue Wang, James U. Surjadi, Carlos M. Portela, Tian Chen
Abstract: For their resilience and toughness, filamentous entanglements are ubiquitous in both natural and engineered systems across length scales, from polymer-chain- to collagen-networks and from cable-net structures to forest canopies. Textiles are an everyday manifestation of filamentous entanglement: the remarkable resilience and toughness in knitted fabrics arise predominately from the topology of interlooped yarns. Yet most architected materials do not exploit entanglement as a design primitive, and industrial knitting fixes a narrow set of patterns for manufacturability. Additive manufacturing has recently enabled interlocking structures such as chainmail, knot and woven assemblies, hinting at broader possibilities for entangled architectures. The general challenge is to treat knitting itself as a three-dimensional architected material with predictable and tunable mechanics across scales. Here, we show that knitted architectures fabricated additively can be recast as periodic entangled solids whose responses are both fabric-like and programmable. We reproduce the characteristic behavior of conventional planar knits and extend knitting into the third dimension by interlooping along three orthogonal directions, yielding volumetric knits whose stiffness and dissipation are tuned by prescribed pre-strain. We propose a simple scaling that unifies the responses across stitch geometries and constituent materials. Further, we realize the same topology from centimeter to micrometer scales, culminating in the fabrication of what is, to our knowledge, the smallest knitted structure ever made. By demonstrating 3D-printed knits can be interpreted both as a traditional fabric, as well as a novel architected material with defined periodicity, this work establishes the dual nature of entangled filaments and paves the way towards a new form of material architectures with high degrees of entanglement.

Title: Extreme statistics and spacing distribution in a Brownian gas correlated by resetting
Authors: Marco Biroli, Hernan Larralde, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional gas of $N$ Brownian particles that diffuse independently, but are {\it simultaneously} reset to the origin at a constant rate $r$. The system approaches a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) with long-range interactions induced by the simultaneous resetting. Despite the presence of strong correlations, we show that several observables can be computed exactly, which include the global average density, the distribution of the position of the $k$-th rightmost particle and the spacing distribution between two successive particles. Our analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations. We also discuss a possible experimental realisation of this resetting gas using optical traps.

Title: Classical uncertainty relations and entropy production in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics
Authors: Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi, Luca Peliti
Abstract: We analyze Fürth's 1933 classical uncertainty relations in the modern language of stochastic differential equations. Our interest is motivated by applications to non-equilibrium classical statistical mechanics. We show that Fürth's uncertainty relations are a property enjoyed by martingales under the measure of a diffusion process. This result implies a lower bound on fluctuations in current velocities of entropic quantifiers of transitions in stochastic thermodynamics. In cases of particular interest, we recover an inequality well known in optimal mass transport relating the mean kinetic energy of the current velocity and the squared quadratic Wasserstein distance between the probability distributions of the entropy. In performing our analysis, we also avail us of an unpublished argument due to Krzysztof Gawȩdzki to derive a lower bound to the entropy production by transition described by Langevin-Kramers process in terms of the squared quadratic Wasserstein distance between the initial and final states of the transition. Finally, we illustrate how Fürth's relations admit a straightforward extension to piecewise deterministic processes. We thus show that the results in the paper concern properties enjoyed by general Markov processes.

Title: Full Counting Statistics of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov Bound States
Authors: David Christian Ohnmacht, Wolfgang Belzig, Juan Carlos Cuevas
Abstract: With the help of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) it has become possible to address single magnetic impurities on superconducting surfaces and to investigate the peculiar properties of the in-gap states known as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states. However, until very recently YSR states were only investigated with conventional tunneling spectroscopy, missing the crucial information contained in other transport properties such as shot noise. Here, we adapt the concept of full counting statistics (FCS) to provide a very deep insight into the spin-dependent transport in these hybrid systems. We illustrate the power of FCS by analyzing different situations in which YSR states show up including single-impurity junctions, as well as double-impurity systems where one can probe the tunneling between individual YSR states. The FCS concept allows us to unambiguously identify every tunneling process that plays a role in these situations. Moreover, FCS provides all the relevant transport properties, including current, shot noise and all the cumulants of the current distribution. Our approach can reproduce the experimental results recently reported on the shot noise of a single-impurity junction with a normal STM tip. We also predict the signatures of resonant (and non-resonant) multiple Andreev reflections in the shot noise of single-impurity junctions with two superconducting electrodes. In the case of double-impurity junctions we show that the direct tunneling between YSR states is characterized by a strong reduction of the Fano factor that reaches a minimum value of 7/32, a new fundamental result in quantum transport. The FCS approach presented here can be naturally extended to investigate the spin-dependent superconducting transport in a variety of situations, and it is also suitable to analyze multi-terminal superconducting junctions, irradiated contacts, and many other basic situations.

Title: Fermi Surface Bosonization for Non-Fermi Liquids
Authors: SangEun Han, Félix Desrochers, Yong Baek Kim
Abstract: Understanding non-Fermi liquids in dimensions higher than one remains one of the most formidable challenges in modern condensed matter physics. These systems, characterized by an abundance of gapless degrees of freedom and the absence of well-defined quasiparticles, defy conventional analytical frameworks. Inspired by recent work [Delacretaz, Du, Mehta, and Son, Physical Review Research, 4, 033131 (2022)], we present a procedure for bosonizing Fermi surfaces that does not rely on the existence of sharp excitation and is thus directly applicable to non-Fermi liquids. Our method involves parameterizing the generalized fermionic distribution function through a bosonic field that describes frequency-dependent local variations of the chemical potential in momentum space. We propose an effective action that produces the collisionless quantum Boltzmann equation as its equation of motion and can be used for any dimension and Fermi surface of interest. Even at the quadratic order, this action reproduces non-trivial results obtainable only through involved analysis with alternative means. By offering an alternative method directly applicable to studying the low-energy physics of Fermi and non-Fermi liquids, our work potentially stands as an important building block in advancing the comprehension of strange metals and associated phenomena.

Title: Roughness and critical force for depinning at 3-loop order
Authors: Mikhail N. Semeikin, Kay Joerg Wiese
Abstract: A $d$-dimensional elastic manifold at depinning is described by a renormalized field theory, based on the Functional Renormalization Group (FRG). Here we analyze this theory to 3-loop order, equivalent to third order in $\epsilon=4-d$, where $d$ is the internal dimension. The critical exponent reads $\zeta = \frac \epsilon3 + 0.04777 \epsilon^2 -0.068354 \epsilon^3 + {\cal O}(\epsilon^4)$. Using that $\zeta(d=0)=2^-$, we estimate $\zeta(d=1)=1.266(20)$, $\zeta(d=2)=0.752(1)$ and $\zeta(d=3)=0.357(1)$. For Gaussian disorder, the pinning force per site is estimated as $f_{\rm c}= {\cal B} m^{2}\rho_m + f_{\rm c}^0$, where $m^2$ is the strength of the confining potential, $\cal B$ a universal amplitude, $\rho_m$ the correlation length of the disorder, and $f_{\rm c}^0$ a non-universal lattice dependent term. For charge-density waves, we find a mapping to the standard $\phi^4$-theory with $O(n)$ symmetry in the limit of $n\to -2$. This gives $f_{\rm c} = \tilde {\cal A}(d) m^2 \ln (m) + f_{\rm c}^0 $, with $\tilde {\cal A}(d) = -\partial_n \big[\nu(d,n)^{-1}+\eta(d,n)\big]_{n=-2}$, reminiscent of log-CFTs.

Title: A general formula of frequency and amplitude for shaking induced Mott insulator in atomtronic transistors
Authors: Wenxi Lai, Yu-Quan Ma, Yi-Wen Wei
Abstract: Mott insulator of atomic transport can be realized in driven optical lattices by choosing particular ratio of driving frequency and amplitude, which has been studied as Floquet engineering with time-independent effective Hamiltonian approach. Here, we give a general formula of frequency-amplitude radio for realization of the driving induced insulator-conductor transition in a double-well open system, using numerical computation with instantaneous eigenstates approach. The result is owing to the fact that the instantaneous eigenstates approach is applicable in more wide parameter range compared with the time-independent effective Hamiltonian approach. Analysis from the results of quantum master equation shows that the insulator effect is originated from coherent localization of atom wave packets in optical wells.

Title: Lattice Models for Phases and Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries
Authors: Lakshya Bhardwaj, Lea E. Bottini, Sakura Schafer-Nameki, Apoorv Tiwari
Abstract: Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing, in the IR limit, these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.

Title: Sublattice Dichotomy in Monolayer FeSe Superconductor
Authors: Cui Ding, Zhipeng Xu, Xiaotong Jiao, Yinqi Hu, Wenxuan Zhao, Lexian Yang, Kun Jiang, Lili Wang, Jin-Feng Jia, Jiangping Hu, Qi-Kun Xue
Abstract: The pairing mechanism behind the monolayer FeSe is one essential question for iron-based superconductors. In this work, we show the sublattice degree of freedoms of monolayer FeSe plays a special role in its pairing properties, namely the sublattice dichotomy. The high-quality monolayer FeSe samples with atomic flat $1\times1$ topography on the SrTiO$_3$(001) substrates are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By comparing the tunneling spectra at $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Fe sublattices, we find the coherence peak of $\alpha$-Fe at the inner gap $+V_i$ is higher than $\beta$-Fe while the coherence peak of $\beta$-Fe at $-V_i$ is higher than $\alpha$-Fe with a similar amount. We also observed a reversed effect at the outer gap $\pm V_o$. We propose the $\eta$-pairing mechanism between $k$ and $-k+Q$ is the key mechanism for this unconventional sublattice dichotomy effect.

Title: Free energy barrier and thermal-quantum behavior of sliding bilayer graphene
Authors: Jean Paul Nery, Lorenzo Monacelli, Francesco Mauri
Abstract: In multilayer graphene, the stacking order of the layers plays a crucial role in the electronic properties and the manifestation of superconductivity. By applying shear stress, it is possible to induce sliding between different layers, altering the stacking order. Here, focusing on bilayer graphene, we analyze how ionic fluctuations alter the free energy barrier between different stacking equilibria. We calculate the free energy barrier through the state-of-the-art self-consistent harmonic approximation, which can be evaluated at unstable configurations. We find that above 100 K there is a large reduction of the barrier of more than 30% due to thermal vibrations, which significantly improves the agreement between previous first-principles theoretical work and experiments in a single graphite crystal. As the temperature increases, the barrier remains nearly constant up to around 500 K, with a more pronounced decrease only at higher temperatures. Our approach is general and paves the way for systematically accounting for thermal effects in free energy barriers of other macroscopic systems.

Title: Persistence of small polarons into the superconducting phase of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$BiO$_3$

Abstract: Bipolaronic superconductivity is an exotic pairing mechanism proposed for materials like Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$BiO$_3$ (BKBO); however, conclusive experimental evidence for a (bi)polaron metallic state in this material remains elusive. Here, we combine resonant inelastic x-ray and neutron total scattering techniques with advanced modelling to study the local lattice distortions, electronic structure, and electron-phonon coupling ($e$-ph) in BKBO as a function of doping. Data for the parent compound ($x = 0$) indicates that the electronic gap opens in predominantly oxygen-derived states strongly coupled to a long-range ordered breathing distortion of the oxygen sublattice. Upon doping, short-range breathing distortions and sizable ($e$-ph) coupling persist into the superconducting regime ($x = 0.4$). Comparisons with exact diagonalization and determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations further support this conclusion. Our results provide compelling evidence that BKBO's metallic phase hosts a liquid of small (bi)polarons derived from local breathing distortions of the lattice, with implications for understanding the low-temperature superconducting instability

Title: Geometric expansion of fluctuations and average shadows
Authors: Clément Berthière, Benoit Estienne, Jean-Marie Stéphan, William Witczak-Krempa
Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this paper, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.

Title: Topological Antenna: A Non-Classical Beam-Steering Micro-Antenna Based on Spin Injection from a Topological Insulator
Authors: Raisa Fabiha, Patrick J. Taylor, Supriyo Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: Antennas are the quintessential means to communicate information wirelessly over long distances via electromagnetic waves. Traditional antennas have two shortcomings that have prevented miniaturization: (1) their radiation efficiencies plummet and (2) they radiate isotropically when miniaturized to small fractions of the radiated wavelength. Here, we report a new genre of non-classical antennas that overcome these limitations by employing non-traditional principles and harnessing topological insulators. An alternating charge current of frequency 1-10 GHz injected into a thin film of a three-dimensional topological insulator (3D-TI) injects a spin current of alternating spin polarization into a periodic array of cobalt nanomagnets deposited on the surface of the 3D-TI. This generates spin waves in the nanomagnets, which radiate electromagnetic waves in space, thereby implementing an antenna. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave is the same as that of the current. The antenna dimension is only 0.6-1.8% of the free space wavelength and yet it radiates with an efficiency several orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical limit for conventional antennas. Furthermore, it radiates anisotropically (despite being a "point source") and one can change the anisotropic radiation pattern by changing the direction of the injected alternating charge current, which changes the spin wave patterns within the nanomagnets because of spin-momentum locking in the 3D-TI. This enables beam steering without the use of a phased array. We have overcome several limitations of classical antennas by harnessing the quantum mechanical attributes of a quantum material, namely a 3D-TI.

Title: Nonreciprocal Spin-Glass Transition and Aging
Authors: Giulia Garcia Lorenzana, Ada Altieri, Giulio Biroli, Michel Fruchart, Vincenzo Vitelli
Abstract: Disordered systems generically exhibit aging and a glass transition. Previous studies have long suggested that non-reciprocity tends to destroy glassiness. Here, we show that this is not always the case using a bipartite spherical Sherrington-Kirpatrick model that describes the antagonistic coupling between two identical complex agents modeled as macroscopic spin glasses. Our dynamical mean field theory calculations reveal an exceptional-point mediated transition from a static disorder phase to an oscillating amorphous phase as well as non-reciprocal aging with slow dynamics and oscillations.

Title: Exceptional second-order topological insulators
Authors: Yutaro Tanaka, Daichi Nakamura, Ryo Okugawa, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: Point-gap topological phases of non-Hermitian systems exhibit exotic boundary states that have no counterparts in Hermitian systems. Here, we develop classification of second-order point-gap topological phases protected by reflection symmetry. Based on this classification, we propose exceptional second-order topological insulators, exhibiting second-order boundary states stabilized by point-gap topology. As an illustrative example, we uncover a two-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator with point-gapless corner states. Furthermore, we identify a three-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator that features hinge states with isolated exceptional points, representing second-order topological phases intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Our work enlarges the family of point-gap topological phases in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Electron-Ion Coupling Breaks Energy Symmetry in Bistable Organic Electrochemical Transistors
Authors: Lukas M. Bongartz, Garrett LeCroy, Tyler J. Quill, Nicholas Siemons, Gerwin Dijk, Adam Marks, Christina Cheng, Hans Kleemann, Karl Leo, Alberto Salleo
Abstract: Organic electrochemical transistors are extensively studied for applications ranging from bioelectronics to analog and neuromorphic computing. Despite significant advances, the fundamental interactions between the polymer semiconductor channel and the electrolyte, which critically determine the device performance, remain underexplored. Here, we examine the coupling between the benchmark semiconductor PEDOT:PSS and an ionic liquid to explain the bistable and non-volatile behavior observed in OECTs. Using X-ray scattering and spectroscopy techniques, we demonstrate how the electrolyte modifies the channel composition, enhances molecular order, and reshapes the energetic landscape. Notably, the observed bistability arises from asymmetric and path-dependent energetics during doping and dedoping, resulting in two distinct paths, driven by a direct interaction between the electronic and ionic charge carriers. These findings highlight the electrolyte's role in tuning charge carrier dynamics, positioning it as a powerful yet underutilized lever for enabling novel device functionalities.

Title: Melting Points and Formation Free Energies of Carbon Compounds with Sodalite Structure
Authors: Kazuhiro Sano, Kenshin Nato
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the melting temperatures $T_{\rm m}$ and formation free energy of carbon compounds with sodalite structures, $X$C$ _6$, $X$C$ _{10}$, and $X$C$ _{12}$, where $X$ is F, Na, Cl, and so on. These compounds are expected to be phonon-mediated superconductors exhibiting high transition temperatures $T_{\rm c}$ of up to about 100 K. We estimate $T_{\rm m}$ as a function of pressure $P$ by using the first-principles molecular dynamics method and show the results as phase diagrams on the $P$-$T$ plane together with the results of $T_{\rm c}$. It indicates that the $T_{\rm m}$ of NaC$_{\rm 6}$, which has a $T_{\rm c}$ up to about 100 K, is about $1300$ K or more at $P=30$ GPa. Furthermore, the $T_{\rm m}$ of FC$_{\rm 6}$ is about 2200 K even at $P=0$ GPa, where its $T_{\rm c}$ is about 80 K. Similar results are obtained for FC$_{\rm 10}$ and ClC$_{\rm 10}$ systems. These results suggest that some compounds can stably exist as high-temperature superconductors even at room temperature and pressure. To examine the feasibility of synthesizing these compounds, we estimate the formation enthalpies and formation free energies. These results suggest that NaC$_6$ could be formed under a sufficiently high pressure of about 300 GPa and a high temperature of about 6500 K.

Title: Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moiré matter beyond one billion sites
Authors: Yitao Sun, Marcel Niedermeier, Tiago V. C. Antão, Adolfo O. Fumega, Jose L. Lado
Abstract: Moiré and super-moiré materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moiré systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moiré materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moiré systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moiré quantum matter.

Abstract: Multiterminal Josephson junctions are a promising platform to study non-trivial topology in engineered quantum systems. Yet, experimentally meaningful insight into what exactly makes these systems topologically non-trivial remains elusive. In this work, we show that zero energy reflectionless scattering modes (RSMs) of the normal scattering matrix result in topological phase boundaries. By analyzing two different setups, we explain the origin of each topological phase boundary and furthermore provide generalizable insight into these systems. The considerations here can be of help for experimentalists as it connects the properties of the normal scattering region to the Andreev bound state spectrum of superconducting junctions in a multiterminal setup.

Title: In situ vs ex situ: Comparing the structure of PNIPAM microgels at the air/water and air/solid interfaces
Authors: Hayden Robertson, Joanne Zimmer, Anuar Sifuentes Name, Cassia Lux, Sebastian Stock, Regine von Klitzing, Olaf Soltwedel
Abstract: For studying the structure of microgel particles at the air/water interface, specular and off-specular X-ray reflectivity (OSR/XRR) allows in situ measurements without any labelling techniques. Herein we investigate the vertical and lateral structure of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels (MGs) at the air/water interface and the effect of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) transfer onto solid substrates. The initial ex situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) scans of LB-transferred MGs at the air/solid interface reveal strong lateral 2D hexagonal ordering across a broad range of lateral surface pressures at the air/water interface before LB-transfer. Notably, for the first time, these results were confirmed by OSR, demonstrating the existence of the long-range hexagonal ordering at low and intermediate surface pressures. For in situ conditions and upon uniaxial compression at the air/water interface, the MG lattice constant decreases non-monotonically. This indicates the formation of domains at low pressures that approach each other and only compress when the surface isotherm reaches a plateau. Comparing the results of in situ and ex situ measurements, our study demonstrates a clear transfer effect during the LB-deposition on the lateral ordering of the MGs: the distance between the particles decreased during LB-transfer, and at high pressures ($\Pi\,>\,17\,\mathrm{mNm^{-1}}$) a second distance occurs indicating small domains with hexagonal internal ordering. The novel surface characterisation approaches debuted here highlight the use of both XRR and OSR to probe the vertical and lateral structure of adsorbed MGs, offering in situ, non-invasive insights without the need for doping or transfer-induced artefacts.

Title: Floquet non-Abelian topological charges and edge states
Authors: Jiaxin Pan, Longwen Zhou
Abstract: Non-Abelian topological insulators are characterized by matrix-valued, non-commuting topological charges with regard to more than one energy gap. Their descriptions go beyond the conventional topological band theory, in which an additive integer is endowed separately with each (degenerate group of) energy band(s). In this work, we reveal that Floquet (time-periodic) driving could not only enrich the topology and phase transitions of non-Abelian topological matter, but also induce bulk-edge correspondence unique to nonequilibrium setups. Using a one-dimensional (1D), three-band model as an illustrative example, we demonstrate that Floquet driving could reshuffle the phase diagram of the non-driven system, yielding both gapped and gapless Floquet band structures with non-Abelian topological charges. Moreover, by dynamically tuning the anomalous Floquet $\pi$-quasienergy gap, non-Abelian topological transitions inaccessible to static systems could arise, leading to much more complicated relations between non-Abelian topological charges and Floquet edge states. These discoveries put forth the periodic driving as a powerful scheme of engineering non-Abelian topological phases (NATPs) and incubating unique non-Abelian band topology beyond equilibrium.

Title: Atomic Josephson Parametric Amplifier
Authors: Vijay Pal Singh, Luigi Amico, Ludwig Mathey
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a driven atomic Josephson junction that we propose as a parametric amplifier. By periodically modulating the position of the barrier, we induce a small current across the junction, serving as our input signal. The pump field is implemented by modulating the barrier height at twice the Josephson plasma frequency. The resulting dynamics exhibit parametric amplification of the signal through nonlinear mixing between the signal and pump fields, which is encoded in a specific microscopic pattern of density waves and phase excitations that can be addressed within the experimental cold atoms capabilities. This work paves the way for tunable amplifiers in atomtronic circuits, with potential applications in several fields including precision measurements and quantum information processing. At the same time, our analysis provides the microscopic explanation of the general notion of parametric amplification occurring in nonlinear coherent devices.

Title: Generic deformation channels for critical Fermi surfaces including the impact of collisions
Authors: Kazi Ranjibul Islam, Aditya Savanur, Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: This paper constitutes a sequel to our theoretical efforts to determine the nature of generic low-energy deformations of the Fermi surface of a quantum-critical metal, which arises at the stable non-Fermi liquid (NFL) fixed point of a quantum phase transition. The emergent critical Fermi surface, arising right at the Ising-nematic quantum critical point (QCP), is a paradigmatic example where an NFL behaviour is induced by the strong interactions of the fermionic degrees of freedom with those of the bosonic order parameter. It is an artifact of the bosonic modes becoming massless at the QCP, thus undergoing Landau-damping at the level of one-loop self-energy. We resort to the well-tested formalism of the quantum Boltzmann equations (QBEs) for identifying the excitations. While in our earlier works, we have focused on the collisionless regime by neglecting the collision integral and assuming the bosons to be in equilibrium, here we embark on a full analysis. In particular, we take into account the bosonic part of the QBEs as well, which, however, turn out to have no effect on the solutions. Decomposing the master equation into angular-momentum ($\ell$) channels, the emergent modes are of two types: Fermi-surface deformations with discrete spectra and particle-hole excitations forming a continuous band. The long-lived zero-sound mode, which corresponds to $\ell = 0$, is found to be robust against damping effects. Intriguingly, we have an infinite family of discrete modes corresponding to higher-order harmonics of the net deformation.

Title: Statistics of power and efficiency for collisional Brownian engines
Authors: Gustavo A. L. Forão, Fernando S. Filho, Pedro V. Paraguassú
Abstract: Collisional Brownian engines have attracted significant attention due to their simplicity, experimental accessibility, and amenability to exact analytical solutions. While previous research has predominantly focused on optimizing mean values of power and efficiency, the joint statistical properties of these performance metrics remain largely unexplored. Using stochastic thermodynamics, we investigate the joint probability distributions of power and efficiency for collisional Brownian engines, revealing how thermodynamic fluctuations influence the probability of observing values exceeding their respective mean maxima. Our conditional probability analysis demonstrates that when power fluctuates above its maximum mean value, the probability of achieving high efficiency increases substantially, suggesting fluctuation regimes where the classical power-efficiency trade-off can be probabilistically overcome. Notably, our framework extends to a broader class of engines, as the essential features of the statistics of the system are fully determined by the Onsager coefficients. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of fluctuations in Brownian engines, highlighting how stochastic behavior can enable performance beyond traditional thermodynamic bounds.

Title: Self-consistency error correction for accurate machine learning potentials from variational Monte Carlo
Authors: Giacomo Tenti, Kousuke Nakano, Michele Casula
Abstract: Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) can be used to train accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), enabling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of complex materials on time scales and for system sizes previously unattainable. VMC training sets are often based on partially optimized wave functions (WFs) to circumvent expensive energy optimizations of the whole set of WF parameters. However, frozen variational parameters lead to VMC forces and pressures not consistent with the underlying potential energy surface, a bias called the self-consistency error (SCE). Here, we demonstrate how the SCE can spoil the accuracy of MLIPs trained on these data, taking high-pressure hydrogen as test case. We then apply a recently introduced SCE correction [ Phys. Rev. B 109, 205151 (2024)] to generate unbiased VMC training sets based on a Jastrow-correlated single determinant WF with frozen Kohn-Sham orbitals. The MLIPs generated within this framework are significantly improved and can approach in quality those trained on datasets built with fully optimized WFs. Our conclusions are further supported by MD simulations, which show how MLIPs trained on SCE-corrected datasets systematically yield more reliable physical observables. Our framework opens the possibility of constructing extended high-quality training sets with VMC.

Title: Large-scale exponential correlations of nonaffine elastic response of strongly disordered materials
Authors: D. A. Conyuh, D. V. Babin, I. O. Raikov, Y. M. Beltukov
Abstract: The correlation properties of nonaffine elastic response in strongly disordered materials are investigated using the theory of correlated random matrices and numerical models. The random matrix theory shows that the divergence of the nonaffine displacement field has large-scale exponentially decaying correlations. The corresponding length scale $\xi$ is determined by the strength of the disorder and can be indefinitely large, significantly exceeding the correlation length of the disorder. The rotor of the nonaffine displacement field has the same length scale $\xi$ except the case of the volumetric deformation. The main theoretical dependencies are confirmed by the numerical investigation of the rigidity percolation model and the molecular dynamics simulations of a model polystyrene in the amorphous state.

Title: Engineering the Kondo impurity problem with alkaline-earth atom arrays
Authors: Adriano Amaricci, Andrea Richaud, Massimo Capone, Nelson Darkwah Oppong, Francesco Scazza
Abstract: We propose quantum simulation experiments of the Kondo impurity problem using cold alkaline-earth(-like) atoms (AEAs) in a combination of optical lattice and optical tweezer potentials. Within an ab initio model for atomic interactions in the optical potentials, we analyze hallmark signatures of the Kondo effect in a variety of observables accessible in cold-atom quantum simulators. We identify additional terms not part of the textbook Kondo problem, mostly ignored in previous works and giving rise to a direct competition between spin and charge correlations - strongly suppressing Kondo physics. We show that the Kondo effect can be restored by locally adjusting the chemical potential on the impurity site, and we identify realistic parameter regimes and preparation protocols suited to current experiments with AEA arrays. Our work paves the way for novel quantum simulations of the Kondo problem and offers new insights into Kondo physics in unconventional regimes.

Title: Complexity reduction of physical models: an equation-free approach by means of scaling
Authors: Simone Rusconi, Christina Schenk, Razvan Ceuca, Arghir Zarnescu, Elena Akhmatskaya
Abstract: The description of complex physical phenomena often involves sophisticated models that rely on a large number of parameters, with many dimensions and scales. One practical way to simplify that kind of models is to discard some of the parameters, or terms of underlying equations, thus giving rise to reduced models. Here, we propose a general approach to obtaining such reduced models. The method is independent of the model in use, i.e., equation-free, depends only on the interplay between the scales and dimensions involved in the description of the phenomena, and controls over-parametrization. It also quantifies conditions for asymptotic models by providing explicitly computable thresholds on values of parameters that allow for reducing complexity of a model, while preserving essential predictive properties. Although our focus is on complexity reduction, this approach may also help with calibration by mitigating the risks of over-parameterization and instability in parameter estimation. The benefits of this approach are discussed in the context of the classical projectile model.

Title: Scalable Machine Learning Models for Predicting Quantum Transport in Disordered 2D Hexagonal Materials
Authors: Seyed Mahdi Mastoor, Amirhossein Ahmadkhan Kordbacheh
Abstract: We introduce scalable machine learning models to accurately predict two key quantum transport properties, the transmission coefficient T(E) and average local density of states (Average-LDOS) in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal materials with magnetic disorder. Using a tight binding Hamiltonian combined with the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism, we generate a large dataset of over 400,000 unique configurations across graphene, germanene, silicene, and stanene nanoribbons with varying geometries, impurity concentrations, and energy levels. A central contribution of this work is the development of a geometrydriven, physically interpretable feature space that enables the models to generalize across material types and device sizes. Random Forest regression and classification models are evaluated in terms of accuracy, stability, and extrapolation ability. Regression consistently outperforms classification in capturing continuous transport behavior on in-domain data. However, extrapolation performance degrades significantly, revealing the limitations of tree-based models in unseen regimes. This study highlights both the potential and constraints of scalable ML models for quantum transport prediction and motivates future research into physics-informed or graph-based learning architectures for improved generalization in spintronic and nanoelectronic device design.

Title: Microcanonical simulated annealing: Massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations with sporadic random-number generation

Abstract: Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (MicSA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the MicSA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.

Title: Quantized and nonquantized Hall response in topological Hatsugai-Kohmoto systems
Authors: Thibaut Desort, Mark O. Goerbig, Corentin Morice
Abstract: We explore the robustness of Hall conductivity quantization in several insulating systems, exhibiting one scenario where the quantization is not preserved. Specifically, we apply the Kubo formula to topological models with the Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction. Starting from the many-body degeneracy induced by this interaction in the topological Kane-Mele model, we consider Zeeman fields to select specific states within the ground-state manifold that reveal a non-quantized Hall response, precisely for the case with a Zeeman field diagonal in the bands of the Kane-Mele model. From a physical point of view, this term may mimic a ferromagnetic order that arises naturally when couplings beyond the Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction are taken into account.

Title: Beyond one-loop calculation: Higher-order effects on Gross-Neveu-Yukawa tensorial criticality
Authors: SangEun Han, Igor F. Herbut
Abstract: We study the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the SO($N$) symmetric traceless rank-two tensor order parameter coupled to Majorana fermions using the $\epsilon$-expansion around upper critical dimensions of $3+1$ to two loops. Previously we established in the one-loop calculation that the theory does not exhibit a critical fixed point for $N \geq 4$, but that nevertheless the stable fixed point inevitably emerges at a large number of fermion flavors $N_f$. For $N_f < N_{f,c1} \approx N/2$, no critical fixed point exists; for $N_{f,c1} < N_f < N_{f,c2}$, a real critical fixed point emerges from the complex plane but fails to satisfy the additional stability conditions necessary for a continuous phase transition; and finally only for $N_f > N_{f,c2} \approx N$, the fixed point satisfies the stability conditions as well. In the present work we compute the $O(\epsilon)$ (two-loop) corrections to the critical flavour numbers $N_{f,c1} $ and $N_{f,c2}$. Most importantly, we observe a sharp decrease in $N_{f,c2}$ from its one-loop value, which brings it closer to the point $N_f =1$ relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Some three-loop results are also presented and discussed.

Title: Hyperuniform interfaces in non-equilibrium phase coexistence
Authors: Raphaël Maire, Leonardo Galliano, Andrea Plati, Ludovic Berthier
Abstract: We show that long-wavelength interfacial fluctuations are strongly suppressed in non-equilibrium phase coexistence between bulk hyperuniform systems. Using simulations of three distinct microscopic models, we demonstrate that hyperuniform interfaces are much smoother than equilibrium ones, with a universal reduction of height fluctuations at large scale. We derive a non-equilibrium interface equation from the field theory of the bulk order parameter, and predict a reduction in height fluctuations, $S_h(\boldsymbol k)\equiv \langle |h(\boldsymbol k)|^2\rangle\sim |\boldsymbol k|^{-1}$, in stark contrast to equilibrium capillary wave theory where $S_h(\boldsymbol k)\sim |\boldsymbol k|^{-2}$. Our results establish a new universality class for non-equilibrium interfaces, highlighting the fundamental role of suppressed bulk fluctuations in shaping interfacial dynamics far from equilibrium.

Title: Non-reciprocal spin-wave excitations in Rashba-Hubbard ferromagnets
Authors: Aastha Jain, Dheeraj Kumar Singh
Abstract: We explore the nonreciprocity of spin-wave excitations in the Rashba-Hubbard ferromagnet on a square lattice. Our study reveals that the propagation of spin-wave excitations exhibit non-reciprocal behavior, i.e., spin waves traveling in opposite directions display asymmetry in energy dispersion $\omega({\bf q}) \ne \omega(-{\bf q)}$, which also results in an asymmetric behavior of group velocity, spin stiffness, etc. We find that this asymmetric behavior arises only when the magnetic moments are aligned inside the atomic plane, while the excitations remain symmetric for out-of-plane magnetization. The first dominating term in the low-energy dispersion is linear. However, if the magnetic moments are out-of-plane, then the first dominant term is quadratic instead. The low-energy non-quadratic behavior is examined in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime for various strengths of Rashba spin-orbit coupling.

Title: The Hitchhiker's Guide to Differential Dynamic Microscopy
Authors: Enrico Lattuada, Fabian Krautgasser, Maxime Lavaud, Fabio Giavazzi, Roberto Cerbino
Abstract: Over nearly two decades, Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) has become a standard technique for extracting dynamic correlation functions from time-lapse microscopy data, with applications spanning colloidal suspensions, polymer solutions, active fluids, and biological systems. In its most common implementation, DDM analyzes image sequences acquired with a conventional microscope equipped with a digital camera, yielding time- and wavevector-resolved information analogous to that obtained in multi-angle Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). With a widening array of applications and a growing, heterogeneous user base, lowering the technical barrier to performing DDM has become a central objective. In this tutorial article, we provide a step-by-step guide to conducting DDM experiments -- from planning and acquisition to data analysis -- and introduce the open-source software package fastDDM, designed to efficiently process large image datasets. fastDDM employs optimized, parallel algorithms that reduce analysis times by up to four orders of magnitude on typical datasets (e.g., 10,000 frames), thereby enabling high-throughput workflows and making DDM more broadly accessible across disciplines.

Title: Excess dissipation shapes symmetry breaking in non-equilibrium currents
Authors: Matteo Sireci, Luca Peliti, Daniel Maria Busiello
Abstract: Most natural thermodynamic systems operate far from equilibrium, developing persistent currents and organizing into non-equilibrium stationary states (NESSs). Yet, the principles by which such systems self-organize, breaking equilibrium symmetries under external and internal constraints, remain unclear. Here, we establish a general connection between symmetry breaking and dissipation in mesoscopic stochastic systems described by Langevin dynamics. Using a geometric framework based on the inverse diffusion matrix, we decompose the velocity field into excess (gradient) and housekeeping (residual) components. This provides a natural entropy production split: the excess part captures internal reorganization under non-equilibrium conditions, while the housekeeping part quantifies detailed-balance violation due to external forces. We derive an exact equality linking the two, along with an inequality identifying accessible thermodynamics. A weak-noise expansion of the stationary solution reveals the general geometry of the NESS velocity field, enabling a unified classification of steady states. We apply this framework to systems ranging from molecular machines to coupled oscillators, showing how symmetry breaking in trajectory space constrains NESS organization. We further extend our approach to systems with multiplicative noise, deriving how additional symmetry breaking relates to curved (space-dependent) metrics. Finally, we show that both the NESS velocity field and stationary distribution can be derived through variational functionals based on excess dissipation. This work sheds light on the intimate connection between geometric features, dissipative properties, and symmetry breaking, uncovering a classification of NESSs that reflects how emergent organization reflects physical non-equilibrium conditions.

Title: The viscoelastic rheology of transient diffusion creep
Authors: John F. Rudge
Abstract: Polycrystalline materials have a viscoelastic rheology where the strains produced by stresses depend on the timescale of deformation. Energy can be stored elastically within grain interiors and dissipated by a variety of different mechanisms. One such dissipation mechanism is diffusionally-accommodated/-assisted grain boundary sliding, also known as transient diffusion creep. Here we detail a simple reference model of transient diffusion creep, based on finite element calculations with simple grain shapes: a regular hexagon in 2D and a tetrakaidecadedron in 3D. The linear viscoelastic behaviour of the finite element models can be well described by a parameterised extended Burgers model, which behaves as a Maxwell model at low frequencies and as an Andrade model at high frequencies. The parametrisation has a specific relaxation strength, Andrade exponent and Andrade time. The Andrade exponent depends only on the angles at which grains meet at triple junctions, and can be related to the exponents of stress singularities that occur at triple junctions in purely elastic models without diffusion. A comparison with laboratory experiments shows that the simple models here provide a lower bound on the observed attenuation. However, there are also clearly additional dissipative processes occurring in laboratory experiments that are not described by these simple models.

Title: Mass-gap description of heavy impurities in Fermi gases
Authors: Xin Chen, Eugen Dizer, Emilio Ramos Rodríguez, Richard Schmidt
Abstract: We present a unified theory that connects the quasiparticle picture of Fermi polarons for mobile impurities to the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe for static impurities. By operator reordering of the underlying many-body Hamiltonian, we obtain a modified fermionic dispersion relation that features a recoil-induced energy gap, which we call the `mass gap'. We show that the resulting mean-field Hamiltonian exhibits an in-gap state for finite impurity mass, which takes a key role in Fermi polaron and molecule formation. We identify the mass gap as the microscopic origin of the quasiparticle weight of Fermi polarons and derive a power-law scaling of the weight with the impurity-to-fermion mass ratio. The associated in-gap state is shown to give rise to the emergence of the polaron-to-molecule transition away from the limiting case of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in which the transition is absent.

Title: Impact of Metal Cation on Chiral Properties of 2D Halide Perovskites
Authors: Mike Pols, Helena Boom, Geert Brocks, Sofía Calero, Shuxia Tao
Abstract: Chiral two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites are formed by embedding chiral organic cations in a perovskite crystal structure. The chirality arises from distortions of the 2D metal halide layers induced by the packing of these organic cations. Sn-based octahedra spontaneously distort, but it remains unclear whether this intrinsic structural instability enhances the chirality. We investigate the effect of the metal cation on structural and phonon chirality in MBA$_{2}$Sn$_{\mathrm{x}}$Pb$_{1-\mathrm{x}}$I$_{4}$ (x = 0, 1/2, and 1). Incorporating Sn does distort the metal halide octehedra, yet it only has a minor impact on the structural chirality. In contrast, the phonons in MBA$_{2}$SnI$_{4}$ are substantially more chiral than in MBA$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$, especially the in-plane acoustic modes. However, this enhanced phonon chirality does not lead to a generation of a larger angular momentum under a temperature gradient, because the contributions of different chiral phonons tend to compensate one another.

Title: YSGAG: The Ideal Substrate for YIG in Quantum Magnonics
Authors: Rostyslav O. Serha, Carsten Dubs, Christo Guguschev, Bernd Aichner, David Schmoll, Julien Schäfer, Jaganandha Panda, Matthias Weiler, Philipp Pirro, Michal Urbánek, Andrii V. Chumak
Abstract: Quantum magnonics leverages the quantum properties of magnons to advance nanoscale quantum information technologies. Ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG), known for exceptionally long magnon lifetimes, is a cornerstone material typically grown as thin films on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) for lattice matching. However, paramagnetic GGG introduces detrimental damping at low temperatures due to substrate magnetization, undermining quantum applications. Here, we study magnetic damping in a 150$\,$nm-thick YIG film on a yttrium scandium gallium aluminum garnet (YSGAG) substrate, a newly developed diamagnetic alternative to GGG. Using ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy down to 30$\,$mK, we compare YIG/YSGAG with a conventional YIG/GGG reference system. We demonstrate that the YIG/YSGAG system maintains low damping from 300$\,$K to 30$\,$mK, with $\alpha = 4.29\times10^{-5}$ at room temperature, comparable to the best YIG/GGG films and bulk YIG, with no low-temperature upturn. The diamagnetic substrate eliminates the dissipation mechanisms that dominate on magnetized GGG, preserving low magnetic damping across the full temperature range. Consequently, YSGAG serves as an ideal substrate for YIG films in quantum magnonics and is paving the way for the development of spin-wave-based quantum technologies.

Title: A perspective on inelastic light scattering spectroscopy for probing transport of collective acoustic excitations
Authors: Hyemin Kim, Hyungseok Kim, Taeyong Kim
Abstract: Understanding and manipulating nanoscale energy transport and conversion processes are essential for diverse applications, ranging from thermoelectrics and energy harvesting to thermal management of microelectronics. While it has long been recognized that acoustic and thermal properties in condensed matters are primarily due to microscopic transport of phonons as quasiparticles, probing thermal acoustic excitations particularly at sub-THz remains a challenge primarily due to limitations in experimental techniques with spatiotemporal resolutions pertinent to probing them. Brillouin light scattering (BLS) and its variant, impulsive stimulated Brillouin scattering (ISS), provide access to these thermal acoustic excitations, enabling measurement of quantities such as acoustic dispersions along with relaxation dynamics occurring in ultrasonic as well as hypersonic frequencies. In this perspective, we provide a brief overview of the operational principles of BLS and ISS, and highlight their applications in probing acoustic, thermal, and magnetic excitations in emerging and low-dimensional materials. We conclude by discussing current challenges and future opportunities for advanced material characterization using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy techniques.

Authors: Cesare Vianello, Sofia Salvatore, Luca Salasnich
Abstract: We study the beyond-mean-field Josephson dynamics of the relative phase between two coupled macroscopic quantum systems. Using a covariant background field method, we derive the one-loop only-phase quantum effective action and the corresponding equation of motion for the quantum average of the phase. These analytical results are benchmarked against the exact quantum dynamics of the two-site Bose-Hubbard model, demonstrating a relevant improvement over the standard mean-field predictions across a wide range of interaction strengths.

Title: Topological characterization of phase transitions and critical edge states in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry
Authors: Longwen Zhou, Rujia Jing, Shenlin Wu
Abstract: Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.

Title: Radio-frequency charge detection on graphene electron-hole double quantum dots
Authors: Katrin Hecker, Samuel Möller, Hubert Dulisch, Şiyar Duman, Leon Stecher, Lucca Valerius, Tobias Deußen, Saketh Ravuri, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Florian Libisch, Christian Volk, Christoph Stampfer
Abstract: High-fidelity detection of charge transitions in quantum dots (QDs) is a key ingredient in solid state quantum computation. We demonstrate high-bandwidth radio-frequency charge detection in bilayer graphene quantum dots (QDs) using a capacitively coupled quantum point contact (QPC). The device design suppresses screening effects and enables sensitive QPC-based charge readout. The QPC is arranged to maximize the readout contrast between two neighboring, coupled electron and hole QDs. We apply the readout scheme to a single-particle electron-hole double QD and demonstrate time-resolved detection of charge states as well as magnetic field dependent tunneling rates. This promises a high-fidelity readout scheme for individual spin and valley states, which is important for the operation of spin, valley or spin-valley qubits in bilayer graphene.

Title: Dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch-Slonczewski equations for spintronics
Authors: Pascal Thibaudeau, Mouad Fattouhi, Liliana D. Buda-Prejbeanu
Abstract: The atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is challenged when modeling spintronic devices where Joule heating is significant, due to its core assumption of a constant magnetization magnitude. Based on a statistical framework that treats the magnetization magnitude as a dynamic variable coupled to a thermal bath, we derive a dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch-Slonczewski set of equations for torques, that captures the transient, heating-induced demagnetization that occurs during high-current operation. Integrating these dynamic equations and comparing them to their stochastic equivalents reveals that both the energy landscape and switching dynamics in high-anisotropy systems are similarly modified. This approach yields accurate and accelerated predictions of critical currents and switching times.

Title: Bridging the Synthesizability Gap in Perovskites by Combining Computations, Literature Data, and PU Learning
Authors: Rushik Desai, Junyeong Ahn, Alejandro Strachan, Arun Mannodi-Kanakkithodi
Abstract: Among emerging energy materials, halide and chalcogenide perovskites have garnered significant attention over the last decade owing to the abundance of their constituent species, low manufacturing costs, and their highly tunable composition-structure-property space. Navigating the vast perovskite compositional landscape is possible using density functional theory (DFT) computations, but they are not easily extended to predictions of the synthesizability of new materials and their properties. As a result, only a limited number of compositions identified to have desirable optoelectronic properties from these calculations have been realized experimentally. One way to bridge this gap is by learning from the experimental literature about how the perovskite composition-structure space relates to their likelihood of laboratory synthesis. Here, we present our efforts in combining high-throughput DFT data with experimental labels collected from the literature to train classifier models employing various materials descriptors to forecast the synthesizability of any given perovskite compound. Our framework utilizes the positive and unlabeled (PU) learning strategy and makes probabilistic estimates of the synthesis likelihood based on DFT- computed energies and the prior existence of similar synthesized compounds. Our data and models can be readily accessed via a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible (FAIR) nanoHUB tool.

Title: Local Order Average-Atom Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Chloe A. Zeller, Ronald E. Miller, Ellad B. Tadmor
Abstract: This article describes an extension to the effective Average Atom (AA) method for random alloys to account for local ordering (short-range order) effects by utilizing information from partial radial distribution functions. The new Local-Order Average Atom (LOAA) method is rigorously derived based on statistical mechanics arguments and validated for non-stoichiometric binary 2D hexagonal crystals and 3D FeNiCr and NiAl alloys whose ground state is obtained through Monte Carlo sampling. Material properties for these alloys, and phase transformations for the NiAl system, computed from static and dynamic atomistic simulations using standard interatomic potentials (IPs) exhibit a strong dependence on local ordering that is captured by simulations with effective LOAA IPs, but not the original AA method. The advantage of LOAA is that it requires smaller system sizes to achieve statistically converged results and therefore enables the simulation of complex materials, such as high-entropy alloys, at a fraction of the computational cost of standard IPs.

Abstract: We study the critical behavior of the Ising spin glass in five spatial dimensions through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis. Numerical evidence for a phase transition is found both with and without an externally applied magnetic field. The critical exponents are computed in both cases. We compute with a 10% accuracy the lower critical dimension at zero magnetic field, finding a result consistent with estimates obtained with entirely different methods, by combining our estimates of critical exponents in five dimensions with previous results for other spatial dimensions. When the results in a magnetic field are compared with previous results in six spatial dimensions, qualitative differences emerge in the scaling behavior of the correlation functions at zero external momentum. This anomalous scaling does not extend to other wavevectors. We do not find indications of a quasi first-order phase transition in a magnetic field.

Title: The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"
Authors: Tomoi Koide, Armin van de Venn
Abstract: We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.

Title: Low-Gap Hf-HfOx-Hf Josephson Junctions for meV-Scale Particle Detection
Authors: Y. Balaji, M. Surendran, X. Li, A. Kemelbay, A. Gashi, C. Salemi, A. Suzuki, S. Aloni, A. Tynes Hammack, A. Schwartzberg
Abstract: Superconducting qubits have motivated the exploration of Josephson-junction technologies beyond quantum computing, with emerging applications in low-energy photon and phonon detection for astrophysics and dark matter searches. Achieving sensitivity at the THz (meV) scale requires materials with smaller superconducting gaps than those of conventional aluminum or niobium-based devices. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of hafnium (Hf)-based Josephson junctions (Hf-HfOx-Hf), demonstrating Hf as a promising low-Tc material platform for ultra-low threshold single THz photon and single-phonon detection. Structural and chemical analyses reveal crystalline films and well-defined oxide barriers, while electrical transport measurements at both room and cryogenic temperatures exhibit clear Josephson behavior, enabling extraction of key junction parameters such as critical current, superconducting gap and normal-state resistance. This work presents the first comprehensive study of Hf-based junctions and their potential for next-generation superconducting detectors and qubit architectures leveraging low superconducting gap energies.

Title: Low-Frequency Noise and Resistive Switching in $β$-Na$_{0.33}$V$_2$O$_5$
Authors: Nitin Kumar, Nicholas Jerla, John Ponis, Sarbajit Banerjee, G. Sambandamurthy
Abstract: The interplay between charge ordering and its manifestation in macroscopic electrical transport in low-dimensional materials is crucial for understanding resistive switching mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the electronic transport and switching behavior of single-crystalline $\beta$-Na$_{0.33}$V$_2$O$_5$, focusing on low-frequency resistance noise dynamics of charge-order-driven resistive switching. Using electrical transport, low frequency noise spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, we probe electron dynamics across the Na-ion-ordering (IO) and charge-ordering (CO) transitions. Near room temperature, the weak temperature dependence of the noise spectral density points to a dominance of nearest-neighbor polaron hopping. Below IO transition temperature (\( T_{IO} \sim 240 \, \text{K} \)), structural analysis reveals that Na-ions adopt a zig-zag occupancy pattern, breaking the two-fold rotational symmetry and influencing the electronic ground state. Subsequently, a sharp drop in resistance noise below the CO transition temperature (\( T_{CO} \sim 125 \, \text{K} \)) indicates the emergence of correlated electron behavior. Furthermore, application of sufficient electric field leads to the destabilization of the CO state, and a transition to a high-conducting state. The material exhibits distinct resistive switching between 35~K and 110~K, with a resistance change spanning two orders of magnitude, primarily driven by electronic mechanisms rather than Joule heating. These findings provide new insights into charge-order-induced switching and electronic correlations in quasi-one-dimensional systems, with potential applications in cryogenic memory and neuromorphic computing devices owing to the low noise levels in their stable resistive states.

Title: Inverse Purcell Suppression of Decoherence in Majorana Qubits via Environmental Engineering
Authors: Vladimir Toussaint
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for optimizing topological quantum devices: instead of merely isolating qubits from environmental noise, we engineer the environment to actively suppress decoherence. For a Majorana qubit in a topological superconducting wire, the exponentially small energy splitting $\epsilon \sim e^{-L/\xi}$ provides protection against local perturbations but renders it highly susceptible to pure dephasing from low-frequency environmental noise. We show that coupling via a parity-conserving operator ($i\gamma_L\gamma_R$) to a bosonic environment yields a dephasing rate $\Gamma_\phi \propto S(\epsilon)$, where $S(\epsilon)$ is the environmental noise power at the qubit splitting frequency. In the experimentally relevant regime where $k_B T \gtrsim \hbar\epsilon$ (with $T \sim 10-100$ mK), the noise power scales as $S(\epsilon) \propto \rho(\epsilon) k_B T/\hbar\epsilon$, leading to a dephasing rate $\Gamma_\phi \propto \rho(\epsilon) T/\epsilon$. This exposes a fundamental challenge: the dephasing rate diverges as $1/\epsilon$ for a standard environment, e.g., a 1D system with linear dispersion where $\rho(\epsilon)$ is constant. We overcome this by designing environments with a suppressed density of states following $\rho_{\text{engineered}}(\epsilon) = \rho_{\text{free}}(\epsilon) (\epsilon/\omega_c)^\alpha$. This creates an ``inverse Purcell effect'' that yields a temperature-independent suppression factor $F_P = (\epsilon/\omega_c)^\alpha$. For $\alpha > 1$, the engineered dephasing rate decreases exponentially with wire length, $\Gamma_{\phi,\text{engineered}} \propto e^{-(\alpha-1)L/\xi}$, meaning longer wires provide better coherence protection. This provides a quantitative design principle where environmental engineering transforms detrimental noise into a tool for coherence stabilization, while respecting fermion parity superselection rules.

Title: Quantum Acoustics Demystifies the Strange Metals
Authors: Eric J. Heller, Alhun Aydin, Anton M. Graf, Joost de Nijs, Yoel Zimmermann, Xiaoyu Ouyang, Shaobing Yuan, Zixuan Chai, Siyuan Chen, Jasper Jain, Mingxuan Xiao, Chenzheng Yu, Zhongling Lu, Joonas Keski-Rahkonen
Abstract: Phonons have long been thought to be incapable of explaining key phenomena in strange metals, including linear-in-\textit{T} Planckian resistivity from high to very low temperatures. We argue that these conclusions were based on static, perturbative approaches that overlooked essential time-dependent and nonperturbative electron-lattice physics. In fact ``phonons'' are not the best target for discussion, just like ``photons'' are not the best way to think about Maxwell's equations. Quantum optics connects photons and electromagnetism, as developed 60 years ago by Glauber and others. We have been developing the parallel world of quantum acoustics. Far from being only of academic interest, the new tools are rapidly exposing the secrets of the strange metals, revealing strong vibronic (vibration-electronic) interactions playing a crucial role forming polarons and charge density waves, linear-in-$T$ resistivity at the Planckian rate over thousands of degrees, resolution of the Drude peak infrared anomaly, and the absence of a $T^4$ low-temperature resistivity rise in 2D systems, and of a Mott-Ioffe-Regel resistivity saturation. We derive Planckian transport, polarons, CDWs, and pseudogaps from the Fröhlich model. The ``new physics'' has been hiding in this model all along, in the right parameter regime, if it is treated nonperturbatively. In the course of this work we have uncovered the generalization of Anderson localization to dynamic media: a universal Planckian diffusion emerges, a ``ghost'' of Anderson localization. Planckian diffusion is clearly defined and is more fundamental than the popular but elusive, model dependent concept of ``Planckian speed limit''.

Title: Mittag-Leffler Quantum Statistics and Thermodynamic Anomalies
Authors: Maryam Seifi, Zahra Ebadi, Hamzeh Agahi, Hossein Mehri-Dehnavi, Hosein Mohammadzadeh
Abstract: Building upon the framework established in our recent work [M. Seifi et al., Phys. Rev. E 111, 054114 (2025)], wherein a generalized Maxwell Boltzmann distribution was formulated using the Mittag Leffler function within the superstatistical formalism, we extend this approach to the quantum domain. Specifically, we introduce two statistical distributions,termed the Mittag Leffler Bose Einstein (MLBE) and Mittag Leffler Fermi Dirac (MLFD) distributions, constructed by generalizing the conventional Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions through the Mittag-Leffler function. This generalization incorporates a deformation parameter (\alpha), which facilitates a continuous interpolation between bosonic and fermionic statistics, while inherently capturing nonequilibrium effects and generalized thermodynamic behavior. We analyze the thermodynamic geometry associated with these distributions and identify significant departures from standard statistical models. Notably, the MLBE distribution manifests a Bose-Einstein-like condensation even in the absence of interactions, whereas the MLFD distribution exhibits unconventional features, such as negative heat capacity in the low-temperature regime. These findings highlight the pivotal role of statistical deformation in determining emergent macroscopic thermodynamic phenomena.

Title: Intrinsic viscous liquid dynamics
Authors: Ulf R. Pedersen
Abstract: When liquids are cooled, their dynamics are slowed, and if crystallization is avoided, they will solidify into an amorphous structure referred to as a glass. Experiments show that chemically distinct glass-forming liquids have universal features of the spectrum and temperature dependence of the main structural relaxation. We introduce Randium, a generic energetically coarse-grained model of viscous liquids, and demonstrate that the intrinsic dynamics of viscous liquids emerges. These results suggest that Randium belongs to a universal class of systems whose dynamics capture the essential physics of viscous liquid relaxation, bridging microscopic molecular models and coarse-grained theoretical descriptions.

Title: Emergent Dynamical Translational Symmetry Breaking as an Order Principle for Localization and Topological Transitions
Authors: Yucheng Wang
Abstract: Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.

Title: Exact strong zero modes in quantum circuits and spin chains with non-diagonal boundary conditions
Authors: Sascha Gehrmann, Fabian H. L. Essler
Abstract: We construct exact strong zero mode operators (ESZM) in integrable quantum circuits and the spin-1/2 XXZ chain for general open boundary conditions, which break the bulk U(1) symmetry of the time evolution operators. We show that the ESZM is localized around one of the boundaries and induces infinite boundary coherence times. Finally, we prove that the ESZM becomes spatially non-local under the map that relates the spin-1/2 XXZ chain to the asymmetric simple exclusion process, which suggests that it does not play a significant role in the dynamics of the latter.

Title: Defect Fusion and Casimir Energy in Higher Dimensions
Authors: Oleksandr Diatlyk, Himanshu Khanchandani, Fedor K.Popov, Yifan Wang
Abstract: We study the operator algebra of extended conformal defects in more than two spacetime dimensions. Such algebra structure encodes the combined effect of multiple impurities on physical observables at long distances as well as the interactions among the impurities. These features are formalized by a fusion product which we define for a pair of defects, after isolating divergences that capture the effective potential between the defects, which generalizes the usual Casimir energy. We discuss general properties of the corresponding fusion algebra and contrast with the more familiar cases that involve topological defects. We also describe the relation to a different defect setup in the shape of a wedge. We provide explicit examples to illustrate these properties using line defects and interfaces in the Wilson-Fisher CFT and the Gross-Neveu(-Yukawa) CFT and determine the defect fusion data thereof.

Title: Addressing bedload flux variability due to grain shape effects and experimental channel geometry
Authors: Thomas Pähtz, Yulan Chen, Jiafeng Xie, Rémi Monthiller, Raphaël Maurin, Katharina Tholen, Yen-Cheng Lin, Hao-Che Ho, Peng Hu, Zhiguo He, Orencio Durán
Abstract: The study-to-study variability of bedload flux measurements in turbulent sediment transport borders an order of magnitude, even for idealized laboratory conditions. This uncertainty stems from physically poorly supported, empirical methods to account for channel geometry effects in the determination of the transport-driving bed shear stress and from study-to-study grain shape variations. Here, we derive a universal method of bed shear stress determination. It consists of a physically-based definition of the bed surface and a channel sidewall correction that does not rely on empirical elements, except for well-established scaling coefficients associated with Kolmogórov's theory of turbulence. Application of this method to bedload transport of spherical grains -- to rule out grain shape effects -- collapses data from existing laboratory measurements and grain-resolved CFD-DEM simulations for various channel geometries onto a single curve. In contrast, classical sidewall corrections, as well as an alternative bed surface definition, are unable to universally capture these data, especially those from shallow or very narrow channel flows. We then apply our method to an extended grain-shape-controlled data compilation, complemented by literature data for non-spherical grains and from grain-unresolved CFD-DEM simulations. This compilation covers a very diverse range of transport conditions, ranging from very narrow to infinitely wide channels, from shallow to deep channel flows, from mild to steep bed slopes, and from weak to intense transport. We generalize an existing physical bedload flux model to account for grain shape variability and show that it explains almost all the compiled data within a factor of only $1.3$.

Title: Practical Few-Atom Quantum Reservoir Computing
Authors: Chuanzhou Zhu, Peter J. Ehlers, Hendra I. Nurdin, Daniel Soh
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) harnesses quantum systems to tackle intricate computational problems with exceptional efficiency and minimized energy usage. This paper presents a QRC framework that utilizes a minimalistic quantum reservoir, consisting of only a few two-level atoms within an optical cavity. The system is inherently scalable, as newly added atoms automatically couple with the existing ones through the shared cavity field. We demonstrate that the quantum reservoir outperforms traditional classical reservoir computing in both memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks, namely the prediction of time-series data using the Mackey-Glass task and the classification of sine-square waveforms. Our results show significant performance improvements with an increasing number of atoms, facilitated by non-destructive, continuous quantum measurements and polynomial regression techniques. These findings confirm the potential of QRC as a practical and efficient solution to addressing complex computational challenges in quantum machine learning.

Title: Non-relativistic transport from frame-indifferent kinetic theory
Authors: Paweł Matus, Rajesh Biswas, Piotr Surówka, Francisco Peña-Benítez
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Newton-Cartan geometry to the kinetic theory of gases that includes non-relativistic gravitational effects and the principle of general covariance. Starting with an introduction to the basics of Newton-Cartan geometry, we examine the motion of point particles within this framework, leading to a detailed analysis of kinetic theory and the derivation of conservation equations. The equilibrium distribution function is explored, and the example of a rotating gas in a gravitational field is discussed. Further, we develop covariant hydrodynamic equations and extend our analysis through a gradient expansion approach to assess first-order constitutive relations for rotating gases. Finally, we address the frame-dependence paradox, presenting a novel resolution that addresses apparent discrepancies. Our construction resolves a fifty-year-old debate about the frame-indifferent formulation of kinetic theory. The resolution is presented in a modern, symmetry-based approach.

Title: Localized RG flows on composite defects and $\mathcal{C}$-theorem
Authors: Dongsheng Ge, Tatsuma Nishioka, Soichiro Shimamori
Abstract: We consider a composite defect system where a lower-dimensional defect (sub-defect) is embedded to a higher-dimensional one, and examine renormalization group (RG) flows localized on the defect. A composite defect is constructed in the $(3-\epsilon)$-dimensional free $\text{O}(N)$ vector model with line and surface interactions by triggering localized RG flows to non-trivial IR fixed points. Focusing on the case where the symmetry group $\text{O}(N)$ is broken to a subgroup $\text{O}(m)\times\text{O}(N-m)$ on the line defect, there is an $\text{O}(N)$ symmetric fixed point for all $N$, while two additional $\text{O}(N)$ symmetry breaking ones appear for $N\ge 23$. We also examine a $\mathcal{C}$-theorem for localized RG flows along the sub-defect and show that the $\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds in our model by perturbative calculations.

Title: Taming Multi-Domain, -Fidelity Data: Towards Foundation Models for Atomistic Scale Simulations
Authors: Tomoya Shiota, Kenji Ishihara, Tuan Minh Do, Toshio Mori, Wataru Mizukami
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are changing atomistic simulations in the field of chemistry and materials science. However, constructing a single universal MLIP that can accurately model molecular and crystalline systems remains challenging. A central obstacle is the integration of diverse datasets generated under different computational conditions. We present Total Energy Alignment (TEA), which is an approach that enables the seamless integration of heterogeneous quantum chemical datasets without redundant calculations. Using TEA, we trained MACE-Osaka24, the first open-source MLIP model based on a unified dataset covering molecular and crystalline systems. This universal model displays strong performances across diverse chemical systems, exhibiting similar or improved accuracies in predicting organic reaction barriers compared to those of specialized models, while effectively maintaining state-of-the-art accuracies for inorganic systems. These advancements pave the way for accelerated discoveries in the fields of chemistry and materials science via genuine foundation models for chemistry.

Title: First Sub-MeV Dark Matter Search with the QROCODILE Experiment Using Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors

Hohmann, Alexander Kavner, Christian Koos, Artem Kuzmin, Benjamin V. Lehmann, Severin Nägeli, Titus Neupert, Bjoern Penning, Diego Ramírez García, Andreas Schilling
Abstract: We present the first results from the Quantum Resolution-Optimized Cryogenic Observatory for Dark matter Incident at Low Energy (QROCODILE). The QROCODILE experiment uses a microwire-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) as a target and sensor for dark matter scattering and absorption, and is sensitive to energy deposits as low as 0.11 eV. We introduce the experimental configuration and report new world-leading constraints on the interactions of sub-MeV dark matter particles with masses as low as 30 keV. The thin-layer geometry of the system provides anisotropy in the interaction rate, enabling directional sensitivity. In addition, we leverage the coupling between phonons and quasiparticles in the detector to simultaneously constrain interactions with both electrons and nucleons. We discuss the potential for improvements to both the energy threshold and effective volume of the experiment in the coming years.

Title: Minimalistic and Scalable Quantum Reservoir Computing Enhanced with Feedback
Authors: Chuanzhou Zhu, Peter J. Ehlers, Hendra I. Nurdin, Daniel Soh
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) leverages quantum systems to perform complex computational tasks with exceptional efficiency and reduced energy consumption. We introduce a minimalistic QRC framework utilizing as few as five atoms in a single-mode optical cavity, combined with continuous quantum measurement. The system is conveniently scalable, as newly added atoms naturally couple with existing ones via the shared cavity field. To achieve high computational expressivity with a minimal reservoir, we include two critical elements: reservoir feedback and polynomial regression. Reservoir feedback modifies the reservoir's dynamics without altering its internal quantum hardware, while polynomial regression nonlinearly enhances output resolution. We demonstrate significant QRC performance in memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks: predicting chaotic time-series data via the Mackey-Glass task and classifying sine-square waveforms. This framework fulfills QRC's objectives to minimize hardware size and energy consumption, marking a significant advancement in integrating quantum physics with machine learning technology.

Title: A solvable model of learning generative diffusion: theory and insights
Authors: Hugo Cui, Cengiz Pehlevan, Yue M. Lu
Abstract: In this manuscript, we consider the problem of learning a flow or diffusion-based generative model parametrized by a two-layer auto-encoder, trained with online stochastic gradient descent, on a high-dimensional target density with an underlying low-dimensional manifold structure. We derive a tight asymptotic characterization of low-dimensional projections of the distribution of samples generated by the learned model, ascertaining in particular its dependence on the number of training samples. Building on this analysis, we discuss how mode collapse can arise, and lead to model collapse when the generative model is re-trained on generated synthetic data.

Title: Co-Designing Spectral Transformation Oracles with Hybrid Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Processors: From Algorithms to Compilation
Authors: Luke Bell, Yan Wang, Kevin C. Smith, Yuan Liu, Eugene Dumitrescu, S. M. Girvin
Abstract: We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To illustrate the oracle's representation-theoretic power and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. As a result, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancillary qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of preparing eigenstates in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation which expresses high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture in both 1D and 2D. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system and are applicable to both near-term and large-scale quantum processors.

Title: Laser-induced spectral diffusion of T centers in silicon nanophotonic devices
Authors: Xueyue Zhang, Niccolo Fiaschi, Lukasz Komza, Hanbin Song, Thomas Schenkel, Alp Sipahigil
Abstract: Color centers in silicon are emerging as spin-photon interfaces operating at telecommunication wavelengths. The nanophotonic device integration of silicon color centers via ion implantation leads to significant optical linewidth broadening, which makes indistinguishable photon generation challenging. Here, we study the optical spectral diffusion of T centers in a silicon photonic crystal cavity. We investigate the linewidth broadening timescales and origins by measuring the temporal correlations of the resonance frequency under different conditions. Spectral hole burning measurements reveal no spectral broadening at short timescales from 102 ns to 725 ns. We probe broadening at longer timescales using a check pulse to herald the T center frequency and a probe pulse to measure frequency after a wait time. The optical resonance frequency is stable up to 3 ms in the dark. Laser pulses below the silicon band gap applied during the wait time leads to linewidth broadening. Our observations establish laser-induced processes as the dominant spectral diffusion mechanism for T centers in devices, and inform materials and feedback strategies for indistinguishable photon generation.

Title: Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning
Authors: Liu Ziyin, Yizhou Xu, Isaac Chuang
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.

Title: Probing forced responses and causality in data-driven climate emulators: conceptual limitations and the role of reduced-order models
Authors: Fabrizio Falasca
Abstract: A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often fail to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To investigate the origin of these limitations, we first focus on a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of multiscale systems' emulators to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. For low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific processes and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application, developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. These results expose fundamental challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory as a principled framework to guide model design.

Title: Entanglement Suppression Due to Black Hole Scattering
Authors: Kazuki Doi, Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.

Title: What do the fundamental constants of physics tell us about life?
Authors: Pankaj Mehta, Jane Kondev
Abstract: In the 1970s, the renowned physicist Victor Weisskopf famously developed a research program to qualitatively explain properties of matter in terms of the fundamental constants of physics. But there was one type of matter prominently missing from Weisskopf's analysis: life. Here, we develop Weisskopf-style arguments demonstrating how the fundamental constants of physics can be used to understand the properties of living systems. By combining biophysical arguments and dimensional analysis, we show that vital properties of chemical self-replicators, such as growth yield, minimum doubling time, and minimum power consumption in dormancy, can be quantitatively estimated using fundamental physical constants. The calculations highlight how the laws of physics constrain chemistry-based life on Earth, and if it exists, elsewhere in our universe.

Title: -Continuum limit of bipartite lattices - The SSH model
Authors: Fotios K. Diakonos, P. Schmelcher
Abstract: We present a continuous non-local model that faithfully replicates the rich topological and spectral features of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Remarkably, our model shares the SSH models bulk energy spectrum, eigenstates, and Zak phase, hallmarks of its topological character, while introducing a tunable length-scale a quantifying non-locality. This parameter allows for a controlled interpolation between non-local and local regimes. Furthermore, for a specific value of a the exact spectral equivalence to the discrete SSH model is established. Distinct from previous continuous analogues based on Schrödinger or Dirac-type Hamiltonians, our approach maintains chiral symmetry, does not require an external potential and features periodic energy bands. On finite domains, the model supports a flat band with zero energy formed by a countable infinite set of exponentially localized zero-energy edge states of topological origin. Beyond SSH, our method lays the foundation for constructing non-local, continuous analogues of a wide class of bipartite and multipartite lattices, opening new paths for theoretical exploration and new challenges for experimental realization in topological quantum matter.

Title: Going beyond Landauer: Information-cost relations from inference based on the maximum entropy principle
Authors: Yuanyuan Xiao, Jian-Hua Jiang, Junjie Liu
Abstract: The Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of information thermodynamics, provides a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of information erasure in terms of the information content change. However, its traditional formulation is largely confined to systems exchanging solely energy with an ideal thermal bath. In this work, we derive general information-cost trade-off relations that go beyond the scope of Landauer's principle by developing a thermodynamic inference approach based on the maximum entropy principle. These relations require only information about the system and are applicable to complex quantum scenarios involving multiple conserved charges and non-thermal environments. Specifically, we present two key results: (i) In scenarios where only the mean values of observables are accessible, we derive an information-content-informed upper bound on the thermodynamic cost which complements an existing generalized Landauer lower bound. (ii) When second-order fluctuations can also be measured, we obtain an information-content-informed lower bound on the change in variances of observables, thereby extending the Landauer's principle to constrain higher-order fluctuation costs. We numerically validate our information-cost trade-off relations using a coupled-qubit system exchanging energy and excitations, a driven qubit implementing an information erasure process, and a driven double quantum dot system that can operate as an inelastic heat engine. Our results underscore the broad utility of maximum-entropy inference in constraining thermodynamic costs for generic finite-time quantum processes, with direct relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamic applications.

Title: Scrambling Without Chaos in Random Free-Fermionic Systems
Authors: Ali Mollabashi, Mohammad-Javad Vasli
Abstract: We study the role of randomness in the scrambling of quantum information within integrable free-fermionic systems. Considering quadratic Hamiltonians with varying degrees of randomness, we analyze entanglement-based measures to characterize the scrambling structure. We show that the memory effect in the entanglement of disjoint subsystems of Gaussian states vanishes when the local couplings are random, indicating information delocalization. The tripartite mutual information exhibits negative saturation values similar to those in chaotic systems, albeit with a smaller magnitude, revealing weaker scrambling under integrable quadratic dynamics. Despite integrability, spectral analyses reveal that local random models display a spectral-form-factor ramp and a partial crossover in the single-particle level-spacing ratio from Poisson-like to Wigner--Dyson-like behavior within a certain range of random couplings. These results demonstrate that randomness can act as a minimal ingredient for inducing information scrambling in integrable quadratic fermionic models.

Title: Krylov Complexity and Mixed-State Phase Transition
Authors: Hung-Hsuan Teh, Takahiro Orito
Abstract: We establish a unified framework connecting decoherence and quantum complexity. By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.

Title: Multiscale analysis of the conductivity in the Lorentz mirrors model
Authors: Raphael Lefevere
Abstract: We consider the mirrors model in $d$ dimensions on an infinite slab and with unit density. This is a deterministic dynamics in a random environment. We argue that the crossing probability of the slab goes like $\kappa/(\kappa+N)$ where $N$ is the width of the slab. We are able to compute $\kappa$ perturbatively by using a multiscale approach. The only small parameter involved in the expansion is the inverse of the size of the system. This approach rests on an inductive process and a closure assumption adapted to the mirrors model. For $d=3$, we propose the recursive relation for the conductivity $\kappa_n$ at scale $n$ : $\kappa_{n+1}=\kappa_n(1+\frac{\kappa_n}{2^{n}}\alpha)$, up to $o(1/2^n)$ terms and with $\alpha\simeq 0.0374$. This sequence has a finite limit.

Abstract: We investigate the interior of AdS black holes under finite shear strain in a class of holographic axion models, which are widely used to describe strongly-coupled systems with broken translations. We demonstrate that the shear anisotropy necessarily eliminates the inner Cauchy horizon, such that the deformed black hole approaches a space like singularity. The anisotropic effect induced by the axion fields triggers a collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon, accompanied by a rapid change in the anisotropy of the spatial geometry. In addition, for a power-law axion potential, sufficiently large shear deformations give rise to a domain wall solution that includes a Lifshitz like scaling geometry near the boundary as well as a near horizon Kasner epoch with the Kasner exponents determined by the powers of the potential. Finally, we find that the interior dynamics of black holes generally enter an era described by an anisotropic Kasner universe at later interior time. Depending on the form of the potential, they either tend to stable Kasner universes, or exhibit an endless alternation of different Kasner epochs toward the singularity.
