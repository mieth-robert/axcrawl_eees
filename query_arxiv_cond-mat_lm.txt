Title: Fractal structure of Christ-Lee model
Authors: Boming Zhang, Yunguo Jiang
Abstract: This paper numerically investigates the dynamical properties of kink and antikink collisions in the Christ_Lee model in the regime of epsilon approaching the phi4 theory. With given epsilon and the initial velocity Vin, we exhibiting the formation of bion, scattering, and n_bounce states. Additionally, we show the self_similar fractal structures in the plot of Vout_Vin with given epsilon. Specially, we find the fractal structure in the plot of Vout versus epsilon, which is not reported previously. We computes the Box_counting dimension for these fractal structures. We find that the Box_dimension is positively correlated with epsilon, and approaches to Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle when epsilon is sufficiently large.

Title: A General Solution for Network Models with Pairwise Edge Coupling
Authors: Alessio Catanzaro, Subodh Patil, Diego Garlaschelli
Abstract: Network Models with couplings between link pairs are the simplest models for a class of networks with Higher Order interactions. In this paper we give an analytic, general solution to this family of Random Graph Models extending previous results obtained for specific interaction structures. We use the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform to show that such higher order models can be decoupled into families of effectively separable random graph models, which might be enhanced with auxiliary, possibly multi-valued, parameters identifying the thermodynamical phase of the system. Moreover, given the diagonalizability of couplings between links, we carry out the full computation of the partition functions and discuss why in some cases they can effectively reduce to the one for the Mean-Field case.

Title: Comment on " Second Law of Thermodynamics without Einstein Relation'', arXiv:2405.17142
Authors: Robert Alicki
Abstract: It is argued the the idea of a single temperature-like variable, introduced in [1], which enters a generalized second law for Markovian open system in non-equilibrium environment is not sufficient for a consistent and useful thermodynamic formalism. The origin of the Second Law and ``local temperatures'' in Markovian theory of Quantum Open Systems is revisited and illustrated by simple examples.

Title: Equivalent Electric Model of a Macrospin
Authors: Steven Louis, Hannah Bradley, Vasyl Tyberkevych
Abstract: Dynamics of a ferromagnetic macrospin (e.g., a free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)) can be described in terms of equivalent capacitor charge $Q$ and inductor flux $\Phi$, in a manner similar to a standard electric LC circuit, but with strongly nonlinear and coupled capacitance and inductance. This description allows for the inclusion of Gilbert damping and spin transfer torques and yields a relatively simple equivalent electric circuit, which can be easily modeled in LTspice or other electrical engineering software. It allows one to easily simulate advanced electrical circuits containing MTJs and conventional electronic components in standard simulation software.

Title: Thermodynamic Relations in Time-Dependent Temperatures and Time-Varying Forces: A Study of Entropy Production and Extraction Rates Governed by the Fokker-Planck Equation in Active Brownian Systems
Authors: Mesfin Taye
Abstract: Most previous works have focused on systems exposed to spatially varying forces and temperatures without looking at the role of time-dependent temperature or force fluctuations in active matter, molecular motors, and Brownian heat engines. However time varying temperature and forces regulate the efficiency and dissipation of molecular motors like kinesin, dynein, and myosin. Cooling of the system may slow ATP hydrolysis, reducing the transport efficiency while increasing dissipation. The performance of a Brownian heat engine can be affected by the cooling conditions. On other hand it is vital to consider the time-dependent force in ATP depletion, weakening optical tweezers, and energy loss in damped systems since this directly affects the motor dynamics and non-equilibrium transport. Thus, this time-dependent temperature or force considerably affects the transport efficiency, energy dissipation, and entropy production in non-equilibrium systems. In this work we examines the impact of time-varying temperature and force on the thermodynamic features of the system. By deriving analytical expressions for entropy production, entropy extraction, and dissipation rates, we extend the existing theoretical frameworks by considering, a force or temperature that varies exponentially, linearly, and quadratically.

Title: A Physics-Based Circuit Model for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions
Authors: Steven Louis, Hannah Bradley, Artem Litvinenko, Vasyl Tyberkevych
Abstract: This work presents an equivalent circuit model for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) that accurately captures their magnetization dynamics and electrical behavior. Implemented in LTspice, the model is validated against direct numerical solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation. It effectively simulates essential spintronic phenomena, including ferromagnetic resonance, field- and spin-torque-induced switching, and spin-torque-induced oscillations. Simulation results demonstrate strong agreement between LTspice and LLGS solutions, confirming the model accuracy and utility for efficient circuit-level analysis of spintronic devices. The ability to incorporate time-dependent magnetic fields and voltage inputs makes the proposed model suitable for diverse applications such as neuromorphic computing, microwave signal processing, and spintronic memory technologies. By providing a computationally efficient yet physically accurate circuit representation, this work enables seamless integration of MTJs into larger electronic systems, potentially accelerating the development of advanced spintronic circuit architectures.

Title: Damped photonic modes in helicoidal graphene
Authors: Abdullah Guvendi, Omar Mustafa, Abdulkerim Karabulut
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of spin-1 vector bosons in helicoidal spacetime, focusing on photonic modes in helicoidal graphene structures. By solving the fully covariant vector boson equation, we derive exact solutions that describe the quantum states of photons in a curved helicoidal background, revealing their energy spectra, mode profiles, and decay dynamics. We find that the decay times of damped photonic modes range from \(10^{-16}\) to \(10^{-13}\) seconds as the helicoidal pitch (\(a\)) varies from \(10^3\) nanometers to \(1\) nanometer, indicating that the structure efficiently absorbs all photonic modes. Additionally, the probability density functions exhibit time dependence, complementing their spatial variation. These findings provide a foundation for the design of ultrafast graphene photodetectors, graphene photodevices for high-speed optical communications, advanced photonic devices, and quantum materials based on helicoidal graphene for various nanophotonic applications.

Title: Mobility of single vacancies and adatoms in graphene at room temperature
Authors: Tuan T. Tran
Abstract: We investigate the mobility of structural defects, adatoms, and defect-adatom combinations in self-supporting graphene subjected to keV ion irradiation. In the first scenario, homogeneous irradiation using 20 keV Ar$^+$ ions at a dose of $3 \times 10^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$ induces tensile strain of up to 0.8\%. This strain diminishes with increasing defect density at the dose of $5 \times 10^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$, indicating a strain-relaxation mechanism. Contrary to the expected localized behavior, vacancies exhibit long-range interactions, contributing to global strain effects across the lattice. In the second scenario, by employing a nanopore mask, we spatially confined defect generation to periodically aligned circular regions surrounded by non-irradiated material, enabling direct observation of vacancy and adatom dynamics. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) reveals significant structural damage in areas adjacent to the irradiated regions, suggesting that single vacancies migrate over distances on the order of 100 nm from irradiated to non-irradiated zones even at room temperature. The build-up of lattice strain observed in this study may play a key role in lowering the migration barrier of single vacancies, thereby facilitating their diffusion into pristine lattice regions. Furthermore, the findings highlight the role of pre-existing surface contaminants in preserving lattice integrity through a self-healing mechanism, where adatom-induced lattice reconstruction mitigates defect-induced structural degradation.

Title: Unraveling the electronic, vibrational, thermodynamic, optical and piezoelectric properties of LiNbO$_3$, LiTaO$_3$ and Li$_2$NbTaO$_6$ from first-principles calculations
Authors: Debidutta Pradhan, Rojalin Swain, Souvagya Kumar Biswal, Jagadish Kumar
Abstract: We have investigated the electronic, vibrational, optical, thermal and piezoelectric properties of LiNbO$_3$, LiTaO$_3$ and Li$_2$NbTaO$_6$ using the first-principles calculation based on the density functional theory. It also shows structural phase transition below $T_c$ due to ionic displacement that may alter the properties of material. We have checked the structural stability by calculating the tolerance factor and formation energy before proceeding to the further calculations. The ground state electronic band structures and corresponding density of states show its semiconducting nature with a band gap range of 3.5-3.7 eV. Optical properties such as dielectric function, absorption coefficient, optical conductivity, refractive index, absorbance and reflectance are calculated using time-dependent density functional theory. Furthermore, the piezoelectric properties and Born effective charges were analyzed to find the correlation between them. In these materials, the distortion induced by the small ionic radius of Li$^{+}$ coupled with strong covalent interaction between transition metal and oxygen leads to high spontaneous polarization which can enhance both piezoelectric and optical properties.

Title: BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$: Strong Kitaev, After All
Authors: Pavel A. Maksimov, Shengtao Jiang, L. P. Regnault, A. L. Chernyshev
Abstract: The inelastic neutron scattering results and their analysis unequivocally point to a dominant Kitaev interaction in the honeycomb-lattice cobaltate BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. Our anisotropic-exchange model closely describes $all$ available neutron scattering data in the material's field-polarized phase. The density-matrix renormalization group results for our model are in close accord with the unusual double-zigzag magnetic order and the low in-plane saturation field of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$.

Title: Inhomogeneity, Fluctuations, and Gap Filling in Overdoped Cuprates
Authors: Miguel Antonio Sulangi, Willem Farmilo, Andreas Kreisel, Mainak Pal, W. A. Atkinson, P. J. Hirschfeld
Abstract: Several recent experiments have challenged the premise that cuprate high-temperature superconductors approach conventional Landau-BCS behavior in the high-doping limit. We argue, based on an analysis of their superconducting spectra, that anomalous properties seen in the most-studied overdoped cuprates require a pairing interaction that is strongly inhomogeneous on nm length scales. This is consistent with recent proposals that the "strange-metal" phase above $T_c$ in the same doping range arises from a spatially random interaction. We show, via mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) calculations and time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations, that key features of the observed tunneling spectra are reproduced when both inhomogeneity and thermal phase fluctuations are accounted for. In accord with experiments, BdG calculations find that low-$T$ spectra are highly inhomogeneous and exhibit a low-energy spectral shoulder and broad coherence peaks. However, the spectral gap in this approach becomes homogeneous at high $T$, in contrast to experiments. This is resolved when thermal fluctuations are included; in this case, global phase coherence is lost at the superconducting $T_c$ via a broadened BKT transition, while robust phase-coherent superconducting islands persist well above $T_c$. The local spectrum remains inhomogeneous at $T_c$.

Title: Theory of Superconductivity in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ and Predictions of New Kagome Flat Band Superconductors
Authors: Junze Deng, Yi Jiang, Tiago F. T. Cerqueira, Haoyu Hu, Eeli O. Lamponen, Dumitru Călugăru, Hanqi Pi, Zhijun Wang, Maia G. Vergniory, Emilia Morosan, Titus Neupert, S. Blanco-Canosa, Claudia Felser, Kristjan Haule, Miguel A. L. Marques, Päivi Törmä, B. Andrei Bernevig
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the flat-band kagome superconductor LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, which has recently been reported to host charge density wave (CDW) order above room temperature ($T_{CDW} \simeq 400$ K). The stable crystal structure above the CDW transition is identified via soft phonon condensation and confirmed to be harmonically stable through ab initio calculations, consistent with recent X-ray diffraction refinements. The electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ is found to be mode-selective, primarily driven by strong interactions between Ru-$B_{3u}$ phonons (local $x$-direction, pointing toward the hexagon center) and Ru-$A_g$ electrons (local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital) within the kagome lattice. Using a spring-ball model, we identify this mode-selective EPC as a universal feature of kagome materials. Employing the newly developed Gaussian approximation of the hopping parameters, we derive an analytical expression for the EPC and demonstrate that superconductivity in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ is mostly driven by the coupling between the kagome $B_{3u}$ phonons and the $A_g$ electrons. The impact of doping is also investigated, revealing that light hole doping (approximately one hole per unit cell) significantly enhances the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ by 50%, whereas heavy doping induces structural instability and ferromagnetism. Furthermore, high-throughput screening identifies 3063 stable 1:3:2 kagome materials, of which 428 are predicted to exhibit superconductivity with $T_c > 1$ K, and the highest $T_c$ reaching 15 K. These findings establish LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ and related materials as promising platforms for exploring the interplay among kagome flat bands, EPC, and superconductivity. Additionally, they may offer valuable insights into potential limitations on the $T_c$ of flat-band superconductivity in real materials.

Title: Generalized Lotka-Volterra model with sparse interactions: non-Gaussian effects and topological multiple-equilibria phase
Authors: Tommaso Tonolo, Maria Chiara Angelini, Sandro Azaele, Amos Maritan, Giacomo Gradenigo
Abstract: We study the equilibrium phases of a generalized Lotka-Volterra model characterized by a species interaction matrix which is random, sparse and symmetric. Dynamical fluctuations are modeled by a demographic noise with amplitude proportional to the effective temperature T. The equilibrium distribution of species abundances is obtained by means of the cavity method and the Belief Propagation equations, which allow for an exact solution on sparse networks. Our results reveal a rich and non-trivial phenomenology that deviates significantly from the predictions of fully connected models. Consistently with data from real ecosystems, which are characterized by sparse rather than dense interaction networks, we find strong deviations from Gaussianity in the distribution of abundances. In addition to the study of these deviations from Gaussianity, which are not related to multiple-equilibria, we also identified a novel topological glass phase, present at both finite temperature, as shown here, and at T=0, as previously suggested in the literature. The peculiarity of this phase, which differs from the multiple-equilibria phase of fully-connected networks, is its strong dependence on the presence of extinctions. These findings provide new insights into how network topology and disorder influence ecological networks, particularly emphasizing that sparsity is a crucial feature for accurately modeling real-world ecological phenomena.

Title: Atomic Josephson Parametric Amplifier
Authors: Vijay Pal Singh, Luigi Amico, Ludwig Mathey
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a driven atomic Josephson junction that we propose as a parametric amplifier. By periodically modulating the position of the barrier, we induce a small current across the junction, serving as our input signal. The pump field is implemented by modulating the barrier height at twice the Josephson plasma frequency. The resulting dynamics exhibit parametric amplification of the signal through nonlinear mixing between the signal and pump fields, which is reflected by specific patterns of density waves and phase excitations. We employ a classical-field dynamics method and benchmark our results against driven circuit dynamics. This work paves the way for tunable quantum amplifiers in atomtronic circuits, with potential applications in several fields including precision measurements and quantum information processing.

Title: A brief introduction to fluctuation theorems: from theory to experiments
Authors: Thalyta T. Martins, André H. A. Malavazi, Lucas P. Kamizaki, Artyom Petrosyan, Benjamin Besga, Sergio Ciliberto, Sérgio R. Muniz
Abstract: Thermodynamics is a fundamental branch of physics, and over the years, it has evolved to include mesoscopic and out-of-equilibrium systems driven by theoretical and experimental advances at the micro- and nanoscale. This development has led to \textit{stochastic thermodynamics}, a framework that connects microscopic fluctuations with macroscopic laws. Despite their significance, fundamental ideas, such as fluctuation theorems, are frequently not covered in current curricula, leaving them largely unknown across many disciplines. Here, we present the core results of stochastic thermodynamics, particularly the Jarzynski equality and the Crooks theorem, using an integrated approach combining theoretical foundations with experimental verification using optical tweezers. This approach helps to clarify the fundamentals, linking theoretical ideas to real elements in the lab, showing the simplicity of the apparatus, and presenting detailed procedures for calibration and calculation of relevant quantities to enable the implementation of these experiments in new research and teaching laboratories. The goal is to enrich thermodynamics education and to stimulate exploration in this evolving field.

Title: Non-reciprocal interactions and high-dimensional chaos: comparing dynamics and statistics of equilibria in a solvable model
Authors: Samantha J. Fournier, Alessandro Pacco, Valentina Ros, Pierfrancesco Urbani
Abstract: We investigate a model of high-dimensional dynamical variables with all-to-all interactions that are random and non-reciprocal. We characterize its phase diagram and point out that the model can exhibit chaotic dynamics. We show that the equations describing the system's dynamics exhibit a number of equilibria that is exponentially large in the dimensionality of the system, and these equilibria are all linearly unstable in the chaotic phase. Solving the effective equations governing the dynamics in the infinite-dimensional limit, we determine the typical properties (magnetization, overlap) of the configurations belonging to the attractor manifold. We show that these properties cannot be inferred from those of the equilibria, challenging the expectation that chaos can be understood purely in terms of the numerous unstable equilibria of the dynamical equations. We discuss the dependence of this scenario on the strength of non-reciprocity in the interactions. These results are obtained through a combination of analytical methods such as Dynamical Mean-Field Theory and the Kac-Rice formalism.

Title: Toward Sustainable Polymer Design: A Molecular Dynamics-Informed Machine Learning Approach for Vitrimers
Authors: Yiwen Zheng, Agni K. Biswal, Yaqi Guo, Prakash Thakolkaran, Yash Kokane, Vikas Varshney, Siddhant Kumar, Aniruddh Vashisth
Abstract: Vitrimer is an emerging class of sustainable polymers with self-healing capabilities enabled by dynamic covalent adaptive networks. However, their limited molecular diversity constrains their property space and potential applications. Recent development in machine learning (ML) techniques accelerates polymer design by predicting properties and virtually screening candidates, yet the scarcity of available experimental vitrimer data poses challenges in training ML models. To address this, we leverage molecular dynamics (MD) data generated by our previous work to train and benchmark seven ML models covering six feature representations for glass transition temperature (Tg) prediction. By averaging predicted Tg from different models, the model ensemble approach outperforms individual models, allowing for accurate and efficient property prediction on unlabeled datasets. Two novel vitrimers are identified and synthesized, exhibiting experimentally validated higher Tg than existing bifunctional transesterification vitrimers, along with demonstrated healability. This work explores the possibility of using MD data to train ML models in the absence of sufficient experimental data, enabling the discovery of novel, synthesizable polymer chemistries with superior properties. The integrated MD-ML approach offers polymer chemists an efficient tool for designing polymers tailored to diverse applications.

Title: Modeling Practical Capacitive Structures for Electronic and Dielectric Property Extraction and Analysis
Authors: James G. Champlain, Vikrant J. Gokhale, Matthew T. Hardy, Eric N. Jin
Abstract: A method for modeling the full steady-state and small-signal behavior of practical capacitive structures, such as metal-insulator-metal capacitors, diodes, and transistors, is presented. Simple lumped element models fail to properly represent the behavior of most practical structures, resulting in incorrect electronic material property extraction and evaluation. The methodology and model presented in this paper properly characterizes practical structures and can be employed to more accurately understand and evaluate experimental results, extract various electronic and dielectric properties of the constituent materials, and predict possible behavior of new structures and materials. The impact of dielectric properties (e.g., real versus complex permittivity, conductance, Cole-Cole dielectric response) and geometry on observed behavior of practical structures, especially with regard to extracting correct property values, is discussed.

Title: Active Hydrodynamic Theory of Euchromatin and Heterochromatin
Authors: S. Alex Rautu, Alexandra Zidovska, David Saintillan, Michael J. Shelley
Abstract: The genome contains genetic information essential for cell's life. The genome's spatial organization inside the cell nucleus is critical for its proper function including gene regulation. The two major genomic compartments -- euchromatin and heterochromatin -- contain largely transcriptionally active and silenced genes, respectively, and exhibit distinct dynamics. In this work, we present a hydrodynamic framework that describes the large-scale behavior of euchromatin and heterochromatin, and accounts for the interplay of mechanical forces, active processes, and nuclear confinement. Our model shows contractile stresses from cross-linking proteins lead to the formation of heterochromatin droplets via mechanically driven phase separation. These droplets grow, coalesce, and in nuclear confinement, wet the boundary. Active processes, such as gene transcription in euchromatin, introduce non-equilibrium fluctuations that drive long-range, coherent motions of chromatin as well as the nucleoplasm, and thus alter the genome's spatial organization. These fluctuations also indirectly deform heterochromatin droplets, by continuously changing their shape. Taken together, our findings reveal how active forces, mechanical stresses and hydrodynamic flows contribute to the genome's organization at large scales and provide a physical framework for understanding chromatin organization and dynamics in live cells.

Title: Tunable multi-bit stochasticity in La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$-based probabilistic bits
Authors: I. Bhaduri (1 and 2), A. Jaman (1 and 2), W. Quiñonez (3), A. Gupta (1), T. Banerjee (1 and 2) ((1) Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials, (2) Groningen Cognitive Systems and Materials Center, (3) Instituto de Nanociencia y Nanotecnología)
Abstract: One promising approach to combat the rapidly escalating computational demands is to use networks of naturally stochastic units called probabilistic bits (p-bits). To date, hardware implementations of p-bits have predominantly relied on thermally unstable nanomagnets. However, the search continues for alternative material platforms exhibiting easily accessible, intrinsic forms of stochasticity. In this work, we demonstrate hitherto unreported p-bit functionality in epitaxial thin films of La0.67Sr0.33MnO3, a material showing an electrically triggered metal-insulator transition, grown on twin-textured LaAlO3 substrates. By leveraging the combined effects of phase and structural inhomogeneities, we show two distinct modes of voltage-tunable stochastic operation: clocked binary switching and unclocked multi-bit switching. Our findings suggest that the differences result from variations in the energy landscape near the phase transition. This tunability of the energy landscape is promising for designing diverse stochastic behavior within the same material, highlighting its potential for applications in true random number generation for cryptography and probabilistic computing.

Title: Monopole current control in artificial spin ice via localized fields
Authors: Julia Frank, Johan van Lierop, Robert L. Stamps
Abstract: Artificial spin ice systems are metamaterials composed of interacting nanomagnets arranged on a lattice, exhibiting geometrical frustration and emergent phenomena such as monopole excitations. We explore magnetization dynamics and monopole current control in square artificial spin ice with added vertical control elements. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we examine how localized magnetic fields from these elements influence vertex configurations and domain propagation, enabling directional and polarity control of monopole currents. The control elements suppress monopole nucleation along one edge, steering monopole flow across the lattice, sometimes even against the applied field direction. These elements also reshape the system's energy landscape, producing tailored hysteresis and guided state transitions. Our results offer a strategy for manipulating collective behaviours in artificial spin ice using localized fields. This has implications for magnetic memory, physical reservoir computing, enabling reconfigurable magnetic logic and spin-based information processing, and device architectures requiring directional magnetic charge transport.

Title: A computational study of nematic core structure and disclination interactions in elastically anisotropic nematics
Authors: Lucas Myers, Carter Swift, Jonas Ronning, Luiza Angheluta, Jorge Vinals
Abstract: A singular potential method in the Q tensor order parameter representation of a nematic liquid crystal is used to study the equilibrium configuration of a disclination dipole. Unlike the well studied isotropic limit (the so called one constant approximation), we focus on the case of anisotropic Frank elasticity (bend/splay elastic constant contrast). Prior research has established that the singular potential method provides an accurate description of the tensor order parameter profile in the vicinity of a disclination core of a highly anisotropic lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal. This research is extended here to two interacting disclinations forming a dipole configuration. The director angle is shown to decay in the far field inversely with distance to the dipole as is the case in the isotropic limit, but with a different angular dependence. Therefore elastic constant anisotropy modifies the elastic screening between disclinations, with implications for the study of ensembles of defects as seen, for example, in active matter in the extended system limit.

Title: Nonlocality-enabled inverse design of Dirac-type and higher-order degeneracies for traveling and evanescent waves in phononic crystals
Authors: Sharat Paul, Md Nahid Hasan, Pai Wang
Abstract: We propose complete tailoring procedures with analytical precision for band degeneracies in one-dimensional (1D) nonlocal phononic crystals, focusing on the role of beyond-nearest-neighbor (BNN) interactions. Unlike trivial Dirac cones at either the center or boundary of Brillouin zone (BZ), we demonstrate non-trivial Dirac-type and higher-order band crossings at any desirable wave number within the BZ by tuning BNN interactions. Our analyses show that odd-indexed BNN interactions determine the quantity and wave number of degeneracy points, while even-indexed BNN interactions primarily affect the frequency. Moreover, we discover new evanescent wave modes and associated degeneracies in the complex-valued wave number. In addition, we study a varieties of spatial-temporal response patterns in time-domain simulations for the interplay between traveling and localized modes at the propagating and evanescent degeneracies.

Title: Intrinsic Berry phase contribution to Hall conductivity in CoS$_2$
Authors: Tamal Kumar Dalui, Hari Paudyal, Durga Paudyal, Ramesh C Budhani
Abstract: In Weyl semi-metals, the conduction and valence bands intersect at distinct points on the Brillouin zone (Weyl points), which act as monopoles of Berry curvature in momentum space. This nontrivial band topology, identified from electronic structure calculations, gives rise to various exotic magneto-transport properties. Hybrid functional calculations that incorporate a portion of exact exchange, magneto-transport measurements, and temperature-dependent resistivity confirm nontrivial band topology and half-metallicity in CoS$_2$ of magnetic ordering temperature $T_{\rm C} \approx 120~\mathrm{K}$. However, electronic structure calculations also show that application of small strain transforms this half metallic character to the metallic. Interestingly, the magnetoresistance (MR) of the CoS$_2$ films is characterized by a reentrant weak localization above a critical field at $T \leq 60\,\mathrm{K}$ and a negative to positive transition in MR as the $T$ goes from $<T_{\rm C}$ to $>T_{\rm C}$. Experimental observation of anomalous Hall resistivity and $ab~initio$ computed band structure, Berry curvature, and Hall conductivity ($\sigma_{xy}$) demonstrate that the $\sigma_{xy}$ in CoS$_2$ is primarily driven by the intrinsic Karplus-Luttinger contribution, often linked to Berry phase physics.

Title: Competing Many-Body Phases at Small Fillings in Ultrahigh-Quality GaAs 2D Hole Systems: Role of Landau Level Mixing
Authors: Chengyu Wang, A. Gupta, S. K. Singh, L. N. Pfeiffer, K. W. Baldwin, R. Winkler, M. Shayegan
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall state (FQHS), an incompressible liquid state hosting anyonic excitations with fractional charge and statistics, represents a compelling many-body phase observed in clean two-dimensional (2D) carrier systems. The expected non-Abelian nature of the FQHSs at even-denominator Landau level (LL) fillings has particularly sparked considerable recent interest. At sufficiently small fillings, another exotic phase, namely a quantum Wigner crystal (WC) state, dominates. Here we report magneto-transport measurements in an ultrahigh-quality GaAs 2D \textit{hole} system where the large hole effective mass leads to a significant LL mixing (LLM) even at very high magnetic fields and affects the many-body states at very small fillings. We observe numerous developing FQHSs at both even- and odd-denominator fillings, deep in the insulating regime at $\nu \lesssim$ 1/3 where WC states dominate. The FQHSs we observe at odd-denominator fillings on the flanks of $\nu=$ 1/4 and 1/6 are consistent with the Abelian Jain sequence of four-flux and six-flux composite fermions, while the ones at even-denominator fillings $\nu=$ 1/4 and 1/6 are likely non-Abelian states emerging from the pairing of these quasiparticles induced by severe LLM. Our results demonstrate that the competition between the FQHSs and WC phases is close at very small fillings even in the presence of severe LLM. We also measure activation energies of WC states near $\nu=$ 1/6, and find that they are substantially larger than what has been reported for ultrahigh-quality GaAs 2D electrons. A moderate LLM is believed to lower the activation energy associated to the formation of WC intrinsic defects. The surprisingly large activation energy for our 2DHS with significant LLM is therefore puzzling, and may suggest a different type of intrinsic WC defect compared to that in 2D electrons.

Title: Topological Peierls instabilities in more than one dimension
Authors: Santiago Palumbo, Pablo S. Cornaglia, Jorge I. Facio
Abstract: A periodic lattice distortion that reduces the translational symmetry folds electron bands into a reduced Brillouin zone, leading to band mixing and a tendency to gap formation, as in the Peierls transition in one-dimensional systems. However, in higher dimensions, the resulting phase can present topological obstructions preventing a complete gap opening. We discuss two different mechanisms for such obstructions, emergent Weyl nodes and symmetry protected band crossings. Based on density-functional calculations, we show these mechanisms are at play in trigonal PtBi$_2$.

Title: Insulator-to-Metal Transition via Magnetic Reconstruction at Oxide Interfaces
Authors: Zengxing Lu, Jiatai Feng, Xuan Zheng, You-guo Shi, Run-Wei Li, Carmine Autieri, Mario Cuoco, Milan Radovic, Zhiming Wang
Abstract: Ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) electronic systems at the interfaces of layered materials are highly desirable platforms for exploring of novel quantum phenomena and developing advanced device applications. Here, we investigate ultrathin heterostructures composed of SrIrO3 (SIO) and SrRuO3 (SRO) layers to uncover their emergent properties. Strikingly, despite the fact that both individual layers are antiferromagnetic insulators, the interfaced heterostructure exhibits emergent metallicity. Through transport measurements, magnetic characterization, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we analyze the underlying mechanisms governing this insulator-to-metal transition. Our findings reveal that the transition is driven by interface-induced magnetic reconstruction, which is further corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction at the SIO/SRO interface is identified as the key driving force for this spin reorganization, as it stabilizes ferromagnetism in the coupled antiferromagnetic insulating layers. These findings highlight the significant potential of engineering interfacial magnetic interactions as a powerful approach to generate and control emergent electronic properties, paving the way for novel functionalities that are unattainable in individual ultrathin films.

Title: Time-resolved measurement of single electrons using a modulated barrier
Authors: Wanki Park, Chanuk Yang, Young-Seok Ghee, Hyung Kook Choi, Bum-Kyu Kim, Myung-Ho Bae
Abstract: Measuring the wave packet of high-energy electrons in solid-state devices is important for quantum information processing. Time-resolved measurements with high time resolutions and small errors typically require detectors with a large RF bandwidth. Here, we demonstrate a precise and time-efficient time-resolved method, where an accuracy in measurements are not limited by the bandwidth. By analyzing the energy variance derived from transconductance measurements under a sinusoidal gate voltage applied to a detector barrier, we extract key characteristics of single-electron states. It includes a temporal variance and the covariance between energy and time. The results are consistent with those obtained using a hyperbolic tangent shaped (linearly varying) gate voltage. The proposed approach provides a simple yet precise method for probing the single-electron states. The present findings will be useful for identifying suitable waveforms for applications in electron quantum optics and quantum information processing.

Abstract: High density data storage and spin-logic devices require highly efficient all-electric control of spin moments. So far, charge-to-spin conversion through the spin Hall effect limits to d-orbital materials associated with strong spin-orbit coupling, especially heavy metals. However, d-orbital heavy metals with strong spin-orbit coupling results in a short spin diffusion length, which restricts the spin transport and accumulation in spintronic devices. Therefore, the conflict between charge-to-spin conversion efficiency and spin transport ability is irreconcilable in d-orbital materials. Here, we report a large charge to spin conversion experimentally observed in the p-orbital In2Bi alloy, exhibiting the coexistence of a large spin Hall angle comparable to heave metal Pt and a long spin diffusion length (4 times that of Pt). First-principles calculations reveal that topological symmetry-protected gap opening near the Fermi level results in large Berry curvature-related spin Hall conductivity. Due to the delocalized nature of p-orbitals and semimetal properties of In2Bi, its spin current can overcome the physical barriers between spin Hall angle and spin diffusion length in d-orbital metals, thereby advancing the development of high-performance spintronic devices.

Title: Composition based machine learning to predict phases & strength of refractory high entropy alloys

Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys can function at temperatures exceeding those of nickel-based superalloys. Aluminum, as an alloying element, contributes multiple advantageous characteristics to various high-temperature alloys. The Aluminum containing RHEAs have the potential of being the best high temperature materials. In the present study we use the machine learning(ML) technique to determine the phase and yield strength of aluminum containing RHEAs. In this regard, we created the Al-RHEA dataset from the published [1] compilation of RHEA data. We applied multiple ML algorithms to the training set and determined that the CatBoost algorithm gave the best performance. We optimized the hyperparameters of this algorithm and tested it for robustness using cross-validation methods. The CatBoost model predicts the yield strength of test data accurately (R2=0.98). The algorithm was applied to estimate the yield strength for alloy compositions absent from our current dataset, achieving accurate predictions for these unrecorded alloys indicating that the model has learnt the underlying rules to predict the yield strength sufficiently. We then predict the effect of varying aluminum content on yield strength of RHEA. The model predictions were rationalized in view of published data on Al-RHEAs. We also developed the CatBoost classifier model that predicts the phases formed in the alloy of a given composition accurately. The cause for errors in phase prediction is discussed.

Title: Onsager reciprocal relations for charge and spin transport in periodically driven systems
Authors: Naoya Arakawa, Kenji Yonemitsu
Abstract: A time-periodic driving field can be used to generate and control transport phenomena. Any transport coefficients in the linear-response regime are restricted by the Onsager reciprocal relations, but these relations in periodically driven systems have been poorly understood. In particular, the Onsager reciprocal relation in spin transport of these systems is lacking despite its vital role. Here we establish the Onsager reciprocal relations for charge and spin transport in periodically driven systems. We consider the time-averaged charge and spin off-diagonal dc conductivities $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ and $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ in the nonequilibrium steady state with the pump field of light. First, we argue the Onsager reciprocal relations for these conductivities with the pump field of circularly, linearly, or bicircularly polarized light. We show that $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ and $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ satisfy the Onsager reciprocal relations in all the cases considered, but their main terms depend on the polarization of light. Our numerical calculations validate our general arguments. Therefore, the spin current generated in periodically driven systems is detectable by the inverse spin Hall effect. Our numerical calculations also show that $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ cannot necessarily be regarded as the anomalous Hall conductivity even with broken time-reversal symmetry, whereas $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ can be regarded as the spin Hall conductivity in all the cases considered. Our results suggest that it is highly required to check the dominant terms of the charge and spin off-diagonal conductivities in discussing the anomalous Hall and spin Hall effects, respectively. This study will become a cornerstone of theoretical and experimental studies of transport phenomena in periodically driven systems.

Title: Efficient Crystal Structure Prediction Using Genetic Algorithm and Universal Neural Network Potential
Authors: Takuya Shibayama, Hideaki Imamura, Katsuhiko Nishimra, Kohei Shinohara, Chikashi Shinagawa, So Takamoto, Ju Li
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is crucial for identifying stable crystal structures in given systems and is a prerequisite for computational atomistic simulations. Recent advances in neural network potentials (NNPs) have reduced the computational cost of CSP. However, searching for stable crystal structures across the entire composition space in multicomponent systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose a novel genetic algorithm (GA) -based CSP method using a universal NNP. Our GA-based methods are designed to efficiently expand convex hull volumes while preserving the diversity of crystal structures. This approach draws inspiration from the similarity between convex hull updates and Pareto front evolution in multi-objective optimization. Our evaluation shows that the present method outperforms the symmetry-aware random structure generation, achieving a larger convex hull with fewer trials. We demonstrated that our approach, combined with the developed universal NNP (PFP), can accurately reproduce and explore phase diagrams obtained through DFT calculations; this indicates the validity of PFP across a wide range of crystal structures and element combinations. This study, which integrates a universal NNP with a GA-based CSP method, highlights the promise of these methods in materials discovery.

Title: A theoretical framework for investigating the role of stiffness heterogeneity in structure and dynamics of flexible polymer
Authors: Arvind Saini, Rajiblochan Sahoo, Rajarshi Chakrabarti, Sayantan Dutta
Abstract: Heteropolymers are ubiquitous in both synthetic systems, such as block copolymers, and biological macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids. Beyond their chemical composition, these polymers often exhibit spatial variations in physical properties. For instance, in biopolymers such as chromatin, stiffness heterogeneity arises from inherent molecular features as well as extensile or contractile active forces. In this letter, we develop a theoretical framework that extends the physics of flexible polymers, a widely used tool to describe biopolymer dynamic, to incorporate spatially varying stiffness. Using this approach, we specifically analyze the structure and dynamics of flexible heteropolymers with periodic stepwise stiffness profiles. We find that stiffness heterogeneity leads to qualitative deviations in dynamical observables such as mean squared displacement while also increasing structural anisotropy. Altogether, this framework provides a platform to interpret stiffness heterogeneity from experimental data especially for biopolymers as well as to design heteropolymers with tailored structural and dynamic properties.

Title: Valley-polarized Quantum Anomalous Hall and Topological Metal Phase in Rashba induced pseudospin-1 lattice
Authors: Puspita Parui, Bheema Lingam Chittari
Abstract: We study the topological properties of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling induced pseudospin-$1$ system Dice lattice under the influence of a staggered electric potential and magnetization. The band structure and topological phases of the system are investigated and compared with pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system honeycomb lattice. Under individual influence of the staggered electric field and magnetization, the system undergoes a distinct phase transition: (i) a staggered electric potential drives the system from a quantum anomalous Hall $(C_n = 2)$ to a valley polarized quantum anomalous Hall phase $(C_n = -1)$ associated with edge modes with a flip in the chirality; while (ii) a staggered magnetization changes the system to a topological metal associated with unconventional antichiral edge bands, from a topological insulator. These results are further supported by calculations of the Chern numbers, Hall conductance, zigzag, and armchair edge states. Our findings enhance the understanding of new topological phases in the 2D pseudospin-1 system and open up a new platform to explore the anti-chiral edge states.

Title: Quantum Resistor-Capacitor Circuit with two Majorana Bound States
Authors: Cong Li, Bing Dong
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the equations of motion for a system composed of a spinless quantum dot coupled to two normal leads and two Majorana bound states (MBSs), utilizing the auxiliary-mode expansion method and the nonequilibrium Green function technique. Subsequently, we use these equations to analyze the linear conductance, adiabatic linear capacitance, and adiabatic linear relaxation resistance of the system. We find that when the phase difference between the two MBSs is an integer multiple of $\pi$, the MBSs enter the zero mode, leading to the complete suppression of the linear relaxation resistance. In this case, the relaxation resistance is highly sensitive to the MBSs modes. On the other hand, when the phase difference is not an integer multiple of $\pi$, the linear conductance is fully suppressed. Furthermore, the linear relaxation resistance remains completely suppressed, even when the MBSs are not in the zero mode, and the system loses its sensitivity to the MBSs modes.

Title: Three-body interactions in Rabi-coupled Bose gases: a perturbative approach
Authors: S Tiengo (IOGS, LCF), R Eid (IOGS, LCF), T Bourdel (IOGS, LCF)
Abstract: In ultracold atomic gases, radio-frequency coupling between two spin states can lead to atoms being in a stable coherent superposition of the two states (dressed states). When the two-body interactions (scattering lengths) are different between the two states, it offers the possibility not only to control the interatomic interaction but also to modify the equation of states with emerging three-body terms with different signs and scalings with the parameters. We derive these terms in a unified perturbation framework and show that they correspond to genuine three-body processes found at different orders in perturbation theory. Our work justifies the introduction of contact three-body interactions in dressed-state systems when the spin degree of freedom is integrated out.

Title: Symmetry broken states at high displacement fields in ABA trilayer graphene
Authors: Simrandeep Kaur, Unmesh Ghorai, Abhisek Samanta, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Rajdeep Sensarma, Aveek Bid
Abstract: In this Letter, we present a comprehensive study of magnetotransport in high-mobility trilayer graphene (TLG) devices under a transverse displacement field, focusing on symmetry-broken Landau levels (LLs) from monolayer-like and bilayer-like bands. A striking displacement-field-induced enhancement of the Landé g-factor is observed in the zeroth Landau level of the monolayer-like band, highlighting the role of strong electron-electron interactions. Additionally, we find a rich landscape of LL crossings in the Dirac gully region, accompanied by phase transitions between spin-, gully-, and valley-polarized LLs. These experimental observations are successfully modeled using calculations based on optimized tight-binding parameters. Furthermore, our results reveal significant particle-hole asymmetry in the sequence of LLs in the Dirac gullies, attributed to differing g-factor values for electrons and holes. This asymmetry underscores the limitations of non-interacting models in capturing the complexities of strongly correlated multiband systems. This work provides new insights into the interplay of symmetry-breaking mechanisms and strong correlations in Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene, advancing our understanding of quantum transport phenomena in multiband systems.

Title: Tailoring non-collinear magnetism and 3d $-$ 4f exchange interactions in RVO$_3$ epitaxial thin films
Authors: O. Copie, J. Varignon, I. C. Infante, M. Martirosyan, F. Choueikani, P. Ohresser, P.-E. Janolin, A. Pautrat, A. David, P. Ghosez, W. Prellier
Abstract: In orthorhombic perovskite oxides (RMO$_3$), substituting R$^{3+}$ rare-earth cations tailors the spin, orbital, and charge degrees of freedom of the central M$^{3+}$ transition metal cations through lattice distortions. In turn, these modify also the surrounding environment of R$^{3+}$. When both R$^{3+}$ and M$^{3+}$ exhibit magnetic properties, phenomena such as spin reorientation and magnetization reversal can occur. In fact, the underlying exchange interactions between M-$3d$ spins and R-$4f$ magnetic moments enrich the multifunctional character of RMO$_3$, particularly when combined with structural distortions. They play a crucial role in achieving appealing properties such as robust magnetoelectricity with non-collinear magnetic orders. Here, we explore the exchange coupling in epitaxial PrVO$_3$ thin films, selectively probing the magnetism of cation sublattices, and uncovering simultaneous V$^{3+}$ $3d$ spin reorientation and Pr$^{3+}$ $4f$ magnetization reversal using spectroscopy techniques. By strain engineering, we manipulate the lattice distortions to rationalize their role in coupling $3d$ spins and $4f$ magnetic moments. Theorectical calculations show that octahedral rotations and Jahn-Teller distortions act as tuning mechanisms, promoting competition between orbital and spin orders. The observed coupling between magnetic cations and lattice distortions can be extended to other orthorhombic RMO$_3$ systems, advancing the understanding of controlling spins in engineered perovskite heterostructures and superlattices.

Title: Subtle Structural Anomaly under Compression in Line-Nodal CaSb$_2$
Authors: Hidemitsu Takahashi, Atsutoshi Ikeda, Shunsaku Kitagawa, Hirokazu Kadobayashi, Naohisa Hirao, Kenji Ishida, Tsuyoshi Imazu, Yoshiteru Maeno
Abstract: We report X-ray diffraction patterns and calculated electronic band structures of the Dirac line-nodal material CaSb$_2$ under pressure. Its superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}=1.7$ K) increases under pressure and reaches a maximum at 3.4 K at around 3 GPa. We observed subtle anomalies in lattice parameters accompanied by a jump in bulk modulus without any change in crystal symmetry at around 3 GPa. First-principles calculations revealed that the distorted lattice of Sb(1) site deforms in the pressure range of 0-3 GPa. Those results suggest the existence of a first-order structural transition and arouse expectations for unusual phononic properties affecting the superconducting state. The calculated pressure dependence of the electronic density of states (DOS) confirms that it is not the change in the DOS that governs the variations in $T_{\mathrm{c}}$.

Title: THz carrier dynamics in $SrTiO_{3}/LaTiO_{3}$ interface two-dimensional electron gases

Abstract: A two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) forms at the interface of complex oxides like $SrTiO_{3}$ (STO) and $LaTiO_{3}$ (LTO), despite each material having a low native conductivity, as a band and a Mott insulator, respectively. The interface 2DEG hosts charge carriers with moderate charge carrier density and mobility that raised interest as a material system for applications like field-effect transistors or detectors. Of particular interest is the integration of these oxide systems in silicon technology. To this end we study the carrier dynamics in a STO/LTO/STO heterostructure epitaxially grown on Si(001) both experimentally and theoretically. Linear THz spectroscopy was performed to analyze the temperature dependent charge carrier density and mobility, which was found to be in the range of $10^{12}$ $cm^2$ and 1000 $cm^2V^{-1}s^{-1}$, respectively. Pump-probe measurements revealed a very minor optical nonlinearity caused by hot carriers with a relaxation time of several 10 ps, even at low temperature. Density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard U term on ultrathin STO-capped LTO films on STO(001) show an effective mass of 0.64-0.68 $m_{e}$.

Title: Insight into magnetocaloric properties of Mn2Nb molecular magnet by relaxation calorimetry: A comprehensive case study
Authors: Robert Pelka, Yuji Miyazaki, Yasuhiro Nakazawa, Dawid Pinkowicz
Abstract: Magnetocaloric effect in [Nb$^\mathrm{IV}${($\mu$-CN)$_4$Mn$^\mathrm{II}$(H$_2$O)$_2$]}$_2\cdot$4H$_2$O]$_n$ molecular magnet is reported. The compound crystallizes in the tetragonal I4/m space group. It exhibits a phase transition to a long-range ferrimagnetically ordered state at $T_\mathrm{c}$ = 47.0(2) K. In order to calculate magnetocaloric properties relaxation calorimetry measurements are performed and a self-consistent scheme based on the magnetic entropy counting for the baseline determination is developed. The molecular field model is used to simulate the temperature and field dependence of the magnetic entropy change. The exchange coupling constant between the Mn$^\mathrm{II}$ and Nb$^\mathrm{IV}$ ions is estimated to be equal to -10.26 K. At the lowest temperatures and for the lowest applied field change values the inverse magnetocaloric effect is revealed, which seems to be characteristic for systems with antiferromagnetic coupling. The temperature dependence of exponent $n$ quantifying the field dependence of $\Delta S_\mathrm{M}$ is calculated on the basis of the experimental results and within the mean-field model. Its predicting power for the universality class of the critical behavior is discussed. Finally, the studied compound is employed as the working substance in the two most natural refrigeration cycles, i.e. the Brayton cycle and the Ericsson cycle, to assess its cooling effectiveness. A cascade system is suggested for the most efficient cooling performance.

Title: Effects of Stirring Time on Formation of Microplastics Fragmented from Photo-aged Polypropylene
Authors: Kazuya Haremaki, Takumitsu Kida, Yusuke Koide, Takashi Uneyama, Yuichi Masubuchi, Takato Ishida
Abstract: This paper examines the evolution of microplastic (MP) size distributions fragmented from photo-aged polypropylene (PP) in stirred water. PP specimens fragmented into MPs with their size of 1-30 um after UV irradiation and stirring in laboratory settings. MPs were dispersed into the water during the stirring process. A series of MP size distributions was analyzed from optical microscope images of obtained MPs. The MP size distribution was described by an exponential function in the short stirring time domain, whereas it changed to a power-law function as the stirring time increased. The fragmentation rate of MPs and nanoplastics (NPs) decreased with increasing stirring time. The obtained MP exhibited higher crystallinity than the photo-aged PP specimen after stirring. This result implies that MP fragmentation is induced by the chemi-crystallization of PP.

Title: Ultrafast Saddletronics
Authors: Sangeeta Sharma, Deepika Gill, John Kay Dewhurst, Peter Elliott, Sam Shallcross
Abstract: Low energy valleys in the band structure of 2d materials represent a potential route to the ultrafast writing of information in quantum matter by laser light, with excited charge at the K or K$^\ast$ valleys representing the fundamental states of 1 and 0. Here we demonstrate that a second electronic feature, the saddle point, is endowed with lightwave control over information states. Linearly polarized light is shown to excite 2 of the 3 inequivalent M point saddles in graphene, generating three possible excited configurations, with which of these are realised determined by the polarization vector direction. We show that saddle excitation is highly robust, with "saddle polarized" states created both in the sub-cycle strong field regime and the long time limit of extended multi-cycle pulses. Our findings, applicable to other members of the graphene family and Xenes such as stanene, point towards a rich and ultrafast light based manipulation of matter based on the saddle point.

Title: Limited Diffusion of Silicon in GaN: A DFT Study Supported by Experimental Evidence
Authors: Karol Kawka, Pawel Kempisty, Akira Kusaba, Krzysztof Golyga, Karol Pozyczka, Michal Fijalkowski, Michal Bockowski
Abstract: Silicon (Si) is the primary donor dopant in gallium nitride (GaN), introduced through epitaxial growth or ion implantation. However, precise control over Si diffusion remains a critical challenge for high-performance device applications. This study investigates Si diffusion mechanisms in bulk GaN using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, supported by ultra-high-pressure annealing (UHPA) experiments. Vacancy-mediated diffusion pathways were analyzed using the SIESTA code, with minimum energy paths (MEPs) and activation barriers determined via the nudged elastic band (NEB) method. The results indicate that Si diffusion barriers vary with crystallographic direction, with the lowest barrier of 3.2 eV along [11-20] and the highest barrier of ~9.9 eV along [1-100], rendering diffusion in this direction highly improbable. Alternative diffusion mechanisms, including direct exchange and ring-like migration, exhibit prohibitively high barriers ($>$12 eV). Phonon calculations confirm that temperature-induced reductions in effective diffusion barriers are minimal. Experimental validation using SIMS analysis on Si-implanted GaN samples subjected to UHPA (1450°C, 1 GPa) confirms negligible Si diffusion under these extreme conditions. These findings resolve inconsistencies in prior reports and establish that Si-doped GaN remains highly stable, ensuring reliable doping profiles for advanced electronic and optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: The electronic structure of the CuO monolayer is investigated taking into account the intra- and interatomic Coulomb interactions on copper and oxygen atoms. Local Coulomb interactions and covalence effects are treated exactly when constructing quasiparticle excitations using the generalized tight-binding method (GTB). The electronic system is described in the hole representation within the eight-band p-d model including long-range hoppings up to four nearest neighbors with parameters obtained from calculations using the density functional theory. Using the multiband Hubbard model, we calculated the dependencies of the band structure of quasiparticle excitations, Fermi surfaces, constant energy maps at the top of the valence band, band gap values and contributions of different orbitals to states at the top of the valence band in the regime of strong intra-atomic Coulomb interactions on copper for different values of the intra-atomic interaction on oxygen $U_p$ and the interatomic copper-oxygen interaction $V_{pd}$. It is shown that the system goes from the insulating state with d-states at the top of the valence band to the metallic state in which the main contribution to low-energy excitations is made by oxygen orbitals depending on the values of the parameters $U_p$ and $V_{pd}$.

Title: Andreev bound states and supercurrent in an unconventional superconductor-altermagnetic Josephson junction
Authors: Mohammad Alipourzadeh, Yaser Hajati
Abstract: Motivated by the orientation-dependent properties of d-wave superconductors (SCs), we investigate Andreev bound states (ABSs) and Josephson current in s-wave SC/altermagnet/d-wave SC (S/AM/D) and d-wave SC/altermagnet/d-wave SC (D/AM/D) junctions. The asymmetric S/AM/D junction exhibits a node-less ABSs spectrum with distinct spin states, arising from AM manipulation. In contrast, a symmetric D/AM/D junction with $\pm 45^\circ$-oriented order parameters exhibits a nodal ABSs spectrum, characterized by spin-split sinusoidal curves. This behavior arises from the angular dependence of the d-wave pairing potential, which introduces a $\pi$-shift in the ABSs spectrum of the D/AM/D junction compared to that of conventional S/AM/S junctions. Additionally, the positions of the ABSs nodes in the D/AM/D junction can be controlled by adjusting the length and strength of the AM layer. Analysis of the free energy and Josephson current reveals additional extrema in the free energy at intermediate phase differences, leading to skewness and a non-sinusoidal behavior in the current-phase relationship of both configurations. These zero-supercurrent phase differences can be tuned by adjusting the properties of the AM layer such as AM strength and length. These findings provide new insights into AM-based Josephson junctions.

Title: Forces and symmetry breaking of a living meso-swimmer
Authors: Rafael A. Lara, N. Sharadhi, Anna A. L. Huttunen, Lotta Ansas, Ensio J. G. Rislakki, Matilda Backholm
Abstract: Swimming is ubiquitous in nature and crucial for the survival of a wide range of organisms. The physics of swimming at the viscosity-dominated microscale and inertia-dominated macroscale is well studied. However, in between lies a notoriously complicated mesoscale with swimmers affected by non-linear and time-dependent fluid mechanics. The intricate motility strategies as well as the complex and periodically changing shapes of these meso-organisms add extra challenges for accurately modelling their dynamics. Here, we have further developed the micropipette force sensor to experimentally study the physics of biological meso-swimming dynamics. We directly probe the swimming forces of the meso-organism Artemia sp. and determine how the propulsive force scales with body size. We show that this scaling law is universal for a wide range of micro- to meso-organisms, regardless of body shape, swimming strategy, or the addition of inertia at the mesoscale. Through deep neural network-based image analysis, we determine the time-reversal symmetry breaking of Artemia as it transitions from the viscous regime to the mesoscale. We discover that this model meso-swimmer achieves an increased propulsive force by increasing its level of time-reversal symmetry breaking. These results capture fundamental aspects of biological meso-swimming dynamics and provide guidance for future biomimicking meso-robot designs.

Title: The role of the effective mass in two-dimensional Dirac electric quantum dots
Authors: Ş.Kuru, J. Negro, S. Salamanca
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a different effective mass inside and outside an electric quantum dot on in its energy spectrum. Depending on the different values we give to the mass, we have found quite different spectra. Specifically, when the mass is positive but lighter inside the dot than outside it, the spectrum increases and splits into two types of states separated by a gap. Conversely, if the mass inside the quantum dot is heavier than the mass outside, the spectrum has fewer states and needs stronger fields in order to confine states. Finally, the case of inverted mass (ie, negative mass inside the quantum dot and positive outside it or vice versa) gives rise to a new spectral curve of edge states. All these cases have been analyzed in detail along this paper.

Title: No-drift phase-change memory alloy for neuromorphic computing
Authors: Xiaozhe Wang, Ruobing Wang, Suyang Sun, Ding Xu, Chao Nie, Zhou Zhou, Chenyu Wen, Junying Zhang, Ruixuan Chu, Xueyang Shen, Wen Zhou, Zhitang Song, Jiang-Jing Wang, En Ma, Wei Zhang
Abstract: Spontaneous structural relaxation is intrinsic to glassy materials due to their metastable nature. For phase-change materials (PCMs), the resultant temporal change in electrical resistance seriously hamper in-memory computing (IMC) applications. Here, we report an ab-initio-calculation-informed design of amorphous PCM composed of robust "molecule-like" motifs with minimal Peierls distortion, depriving the amorphous alloy of structural ingredients that would gradually evolve upon aging to entail resistance drift. We demonstrate amorphous CrTe3 thin films that display practically no resistance drift at any working temperature from -200 to 165 degree C. We achieve multilevel programming of CrTe3 through both step-wise crystallization and step-wise amorphization using a hybrid opto-electronic device at various temperatures. Moreover, the application potential of CrTe3 in neuromorphic computing is testified by its incorporation in a vehicle with automatic path-tracking function. Our work opens a new avenue to achieving IMC-requisite properties via judicious design of the composition and atomic-level structure of disordered PCM alloys.

Title: An appraisal of Understanding Pressure Effects on Structural, Optical, and Magnetic Properties of CsMnF_{4} and Other 3d^{n} Compounds
Authors: Fernando Rodriguez
Abstract: A recently published article in Inorganic Chemistry (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.4c00599) offers theoretical calculations on the effects of pressure on the structural, optical, and magnetic behavior of CsMnF_{4}. Although a thorough theoretical and experimental understanding of this material is certainly warranted, there are previously published experimental results on CsMnF_{4}, as well as on other Mn^{3+} fluorides, under pressure that have not been considered in the aforementioned article. These findings raise questions about the accuracy of the theoretical estimates and the validity of the methodology used to determine the reported structural, optical, and magnetic properties. This paper intends to provide the readers of Inorganic Chemistry and the broader scientific community with a perspective on a publication that directly contradicts interpretations presented in prior research.

Title: Dynamic scaling and Family-Vicsek universality in $SU(N)$ quantum spin chains
Authors: Cătălin Paşcu Moca, Balázs Dóra, Doru Sticlet, Angelo Valli, Tomaž Prosen, Gergely Zaránd
Abstract: The Family-Vicsek scaling is a fundamental framework for understanding surface growth in non-equilibrium classical systems, providing a universal description of temporal surface roughness evolution. While universal scaling laws are well established in quantum systems, the applicability of Family-Vicsek scaling in quantum many-body dynamics remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this, we investigate the infinite-temperature dynamics of one-dimensional $SU(N)$ spin chains, focusing on the well-known $SU(2)$ XXZ model and the $SU(3)$ Izergin-Korepin model. We compute the quantum analogue of classical surface roughness using the second cumulant of spin fluctuations and demonstrate universal scaling with respect to time and subsystem size. By systematically breaking global $SU(N)$ symmetry and integrability, we identify distinct transport regimes characterized by the dynamical exponent $z$: (i) ballistic transport with $z=1$, (ii) superdiffusive transport with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang exponent $z=3/2$, and (iii) diffusive transport with the Edwards-Wilkinson exponent $z=2$. Notably, breaking integrability always drives the system into the diffusive regime. Our results demonstrate that Family-Vicsek scaling extends beyond classical systems, holding universally across quantum many-body models with $SU(N)$ symmetry.

Title: Interface-plane parameterization for macroscopic grain boundary identification
Authors: Adam Morawiec
Abstract: The geometric state of a flat boundary is frequently described using the so-called macroscopic parameters. They are a principal tool for dealing with interfaces at the continuous scale. The paper describes a new method for macroscopic identification of boundaries. The proposed approach is based on Euler angles representing orientations of the crystals. Two pairs of the angles are directly related to two vectors normal to the boundary plane in the crystal reference frames, and the new boundary representation can be viewed as a triplet composed of these vectors and the angle of rotation about the axis perpendicular to the plane. The representation resembles the `interface-plane scheme', but unlike the latter, it is a proper parameterization. Basic practical aspects of the parameterization (such as equivalences due to symmetries, fundamental regions, uniform distribution of boundaries) are considered. The parameterization is applied to examination of Bulatov-Reed-Kumar model of grain boundary energy and reveals its previously unknown features. The proposed boundary identification method, apart from its use in numerical calculations, appeals to physical intuition.

Title: Yin-Yang vortex on UTe2 (011) surface

Abstract: UTe2 is a promising candidate for spin-triplet superconductor, yet its exact superconducting order parameter remains highly debated. Here, via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observe a novel type of magnetic vortex with distinct dark-bright contrast in the local density of states on the UTe2 (011) surface under a perpendicular magnetic field, resembling the Yin-Yang diagram in Taoism. Each Yin-Yang vortex contains a quantized magnetic flux, and the boundary between the Yin and Yang parts aligns with the crystallographic a-axis of UTe2. The vortex states exhibit intriguing behaviors -- a sharp zero-energy conductance peak exists at the Yang part, while a superconducting gap feature with pronounced coherence peaks exists at the Yin part, which is even sharper than those measured far from the vortex core or in the absence of magnetic field. Assisted by numerical simulations, we show that the Yin-Yang vortices on the UTe2 (011) surface arise from the interplay between the gapless surface states associated with spin-triplet pairing and the vortex bound states because of the cylindrical squarish Fermi surface of UTe2. Therefore, the observation of Yin-Yang vortex is strong evidence of the gapless surface states on UTe2 (011) surface, which rules out the possibility of B2u pairing symmetry.

Authors: Sergio I. Rey, Martin J. Cross, Malte L. Welsch, Frederik Schröder, Binbin Zhou, Nicolas Stenger, Peter U. Jepsen, Edmund J. R. Kelleher
Abstract: Coherent acoustic phonons (CAPs)$-$propagating strain waves that can dynamically modify the structure and symmetry of a crystal$-$offer unique opportunities for controlling material properties. We investigate CAP generation in the Janus-like layered alloy tungsten sulfide selenide (WS$_x$Se$_{1-x}$, hereafter WSSe). Employing high-fluence photoexcitation at 400 nm combined with ultrafast transient reflection spectroscopy, we capture the carrier-lattice dynamics governed by a cascade of processes including rapid exciton formation, phonon recycling, and thermoelastic deformation. These phenomena precede the emergence of a robust CAP mode at 27 GHz. Notably, the CAP amplitude in WSSe substantially exceeds that observed in the symmetric parent crystals WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$, which we attribute to an enhanced coupling mediated by a built-in out-of-plane electric field arising from the inversion asymmetry of the WSSe alloy. Furthermore, the implementation of a tailored two-pulse excitation sequence enables optical control of the CAP, underscoring the potential of WSSe and related Janus-like layered alloys as versatile building blocks in optomechanical and nanoacoustic device applications.

Title: Statistical learning of structure-property relationships for transport in porous media, using hybrid AI modeling
Authors: Somayeh Hosseinhashemi, Philipp Rieder, Orkun Furat, Benedikt Prifling, Changlin Wu, Christoph Thon, Volker Schmidt, Carsten Schilde
Abstract: The 3D microstructure of porous media, such as electrodes in lithium-ion batteries or fiber-based materials, significantly impacts the resulting macroscopic properties, including effective diffusivity or permeability. Consequently, quantitative structure-property relationships, which link structural descriptors of 3D microstructures such as porosity or geodesic tortuosity to effective transport properties, are crucial for further optimizing the performance of porous media. To overcome the limitations of 3D imaging, parametric stochastic 3D microstructure modeling is a powerful tool to generate many virtual but realistic structures at the cost of computer simulations. The present paper uses 90,000 virtually generated 3D microstructures of porous media derived from literature by systematically varying parameters of stochastic 3D microstructure models. Previously, this data set has been used to establish quantitative microstructure-property relationships. The present paper extends these findings by applying a hybrid AI framework to this data set. More precisely, symbolic regression, powered by deep neural networks, genetic algorithms, and graph attention networks, is used to derive precise and robust analytical equations. These equations model the relationships between structural descriptors and effective transport properties without requiring manual specification of the underlying functional relationship. By integrating AI with traditional computational methods, the hybrid AI framework not only generates predictive equations but also enhances conventional modeling approaches by capturing relationships influenced by specific microstructural features traditionally underrepresented. Thus, this paper significantly advances the predictive modeling capabilities in materials science, offering vital insights for designing and optimizing new materials with tailored transport properties.

Title: A double-spiral spin ordering in the helimagnet YBaCuFeO$_{5}$
Authors: Yu-Hui Liang, Chun-Hao Lai, Chin-Wei Wang, Shinichiro Yano, Daisuke Okuyama, Taku J. Sato, Yusuke Nambu, Shih-Chang Weng, Yen-Chung Lai, Wei-Tin Chen, Kirrily C. Rule, Chao-Hung Du
Abstract: Materials with a spiral spin ordering always show a rich phase diagram and can be a playground for studying the exotic physical properties associated with spiral magnetism. Using neutron elastic and resonant x-ray scattering on a high-quality single crystal YBaCuFeO$_{5}$, we demonstrate YBaCuFeO$_{5}$ to be a helimagnet consisting of a double-spiral spin ordering. YBaCuFeO$_{5}$ undergoes a commensurate to incommensurate magnetic phase transition at $T_{N2}$$\sim$ 175 K, and the incommensurate phase consists of two spin-ordered components. Both components have different periodicities but with the same propagating direction along the {\it c}-axis below $T_{N2}$. Using resonant x-ray scattering at the Fe and Cu \textit{K}-edges, we further demonstrate that both spiral spin orderings result from the Fe$^{3+}$ and Cu$^{2+}$, respectively, forming a double-spiral spin ordering structure. This can be understood to be caused by the coupling between both sublattices of Fe$^{3+}$ and Cu$^{2+}$ with the atomic lattice.

Title: Finite-temperature charge and spin transport in the one-dimensional Hubbard model accounting for its global [SU (2) X SU(2) X U(1)]/Z_2^2$ symmetry
Authors: J. M. P. Carmelo, J. E. C. Carmelo
Abstract: Using a general representation that accounts for the effects on finite-temperature spin and charge transport of the global [SU (2) X SU(2) X U(1)]/(Z2 X Z2) symmetry of the one-dimensional (1D) Hubbard model, we show that important finite-temperature transport quantities as the finite-field spin and finite-chemical potential charge stiffnesses and the zero-field spin and zero-chemical potential charge diffusion constants are controlled by microscopic processes associated with the spin and charge elementary currents carried by the spin and charge carriers, respectively. We describe the model finite-temperature transport properties in terms of the microscopic processes associated with the spin and charge elementary currents carried by the corresponding carriers. We expect that the general representation used in our study is that suitable to address the open problems on finite-temperature transport in the 1D Hubbard model also discussed in this paper.

Title: Thermoelectric Performance Boost by Chemical Order in Epitaxial L2$_1$ (100) and (110) Oriented undoped Fe$_2$VAl Thin Films: An Experimental and Theoretical Study
Authors: José María Domínguez-Vázquez, Olga Caballero-Calero, Ketan Lohani, José J. Plata, Antonio M. Marquez, Cristina V. Manzano, Miguel Ángel Tenaguillo, Hiromichi Ohta, Alfonso Cebollada, Andres Conca, Marisol Martín-González
Abstract: This study demonstrates the direct correlation between the presence of the L2$_1$ ordered phase and the large enhancement in the thermoelectric performance of Fe$_2$VAl thin films deposited on MgO and Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates at temperatures varying between room temperature and 950$^{\circ}$C. We employ both experimental techniques and computational modeling to analyze the influence of crystallographic orientation and deposition temperature on the thermoelectric properties, including the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity. Our findings indicate that the presence of the L2$_1$ phase significantly enhances the power factor (PF) and figure of merit (zT), surpassing previously reported values for both bulk and thin film forms of Fe$_2$VAl, achieving a PF of 480 $\mu$W/m$\cdot$K$^2$ and a zT of 0.025.

Title: The theory of planar ballistic SNS junctions at $T=0$
Authors: Edouard B. Sonin
Abstract: The paper presents the theory of planar ballistic SNS junctions at $T=0$ for any normal layer thickness $L$ taking into account phase gradients in superconducting layers. The current-phase relation was derived in the model of the steplike pairing potential model analytically and is exact in the limit of large ratio of the Fermi energy to the superconducting gap. Obtained current-phase relation is essentially different from that in the widely accepted theory neglecting phase gradients, especially in the limit $L\to 0$ (short junction). The analysis resolves the problem with the charge conservation law in the steplike pairing potential model.

Title: Exploring the magnetic states in the one-band Hubbard model: Impact of long-range hoppings
Authors: Sudip Mandal, Sandip Halder, Kalpataru Pradhan
Abstract: Correlated electron systems with competing interactions provide a valuable platform for examining exotic magnetic phases. Theoretical models often focus on nearest-neighbor interactions, although long-range interactions can have a considerable impact on the behavior of the system, creating distinct and complicated magnetic phases. We investigate the consequences of competing interactions in a half-filled one-band Hubbard model on a simple cubic lattice, incorporating hopping processes up to third-nearest-neighbors, to explore the underlying magnetotransport properties. Our magnetic phase diagrams at low temperatures, obtained using semi-classical Monte Carlo analysis, reveal that the long-range interactions can disrupt one form of magnetic phase while creating a new type of magnetic order. For the nonperturbative regime (on-site Hubbard repulsive strength $U \sim$ bandwidth) the C-type antiferromagnetic ground state is preferred over the G-type antiferromagnetic phase when the interaction between second-nearest neighbor sites becomes significant to the nearest-neighbor interactions. However, interactions beyond the second-nearest-neighbors are required to stabilize the A-type antiferromagnetic ground state. Remarkably, at low temperatures, a highly correlated paramagnetic insulating phase develops at the intersection between the antiferromagnetic phases, which might promote a three-dimensional spin-liquid state.

Title: Dielectric permittivity of water confined in stacks of charged lipid layers: extracting profiles from molecular dynamics simulations using a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation
Authors: Ludovic Gardré, Swen Helstroffer, Pierre Muller, Fabrice Thalmann, Thierry Charitat, Laurent Joly, Claire Loison
Abstract: Most organic and inorganic surfaces (e.g., glass, nucleic acids or lipid membranes) become charged in aqueous solutions. The resulting ionic distribution induces effective interactions between the charged surfaces. Stacks of like-charged lipid bilayers immersed in multivalent ion solutions exhibit strong coupling (SC) effects, where ion correlations cause counter-intuitive membrane attraction. A similar attraction observed with monovalent ions is explained by SC theory through reduced dielectric permittivity under confinement. To explore this phenomenon, we propose a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (mPB) model with spatially varying dielectric permittivity and explicit Born solvation energy for ions. We use the model to investigate the dielectric permittivity profile of confined water in molecular dynamics simulations of charged lipid layers stacks at varying hydration levels, and compare the results with alternative computational methods. The model captures a sharp decrease in permittivity as the system enters the attractive regime, converging to a plateau value that we attribute to lipid headgroups. The generic nature of the mPB framework allows application to other systems, such as other biological interfaces or solid walls, provided ions follow Boltzmann statistics.

Title: Renormalization group analysis of noisy neural field
Authors: Jie Zang, Pascal Helson, Shenquan Liu, Arvind Kumar, Dhrubaditya Mitra
Abstract: Neurons in the brain show great diversity in their individual properties and their connections to other neurons. To develop an understanding of how neuronal diversity contributes to brain dynamics and function at large scales we borrow from the framework of replica methods, that has been successfully applied to a large class of problems with quenched noise in equilibrium statistical mechanics. We analyze two linearized versions of Wilson-Cowan model with random coefficients which are correlated in space. In particular: (A) a model where the properties of the neurons themselves are heterogeneous and (B) where their connectivities are anisotropic. In both of these models, the averaging over the quenched randomness gives rise to additional nonlinearities. These nonlinearities are analyzed within the framework of Wilsonian renormalization group. We find that for Model A, if the spatial correlation of noise decays with distance with an exponent smaller than $-2$, at large spatial scales the effect of the noise vanishes. By contrast, for model B, the effect of noise in neuronal connectivity vanishes only if the spatial correlations decay with an exponent smaller than $-1$. Our calculations also suggest that the presence of noise, under certain conditions, can give rise to travelling wave like behavior at large scales, although it remains to be seen whether this result remains valid at higher orders in perturbation theory.

Title: Alloying as a new route to generating interlayer excitons
Authors: Suvadip Masanta, Chumki Nayak, Indrani Bose, Achintya Singha
Abstract: We propose a novel route for the generation of interlayer excitons based on the synthesis of a transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer alloy material, WS$_{2x}$Se$_{2(1-x)}$. Using piezoelectric force microscopy, we demonstrate the existence of an internal electric field oriented in the out-of-plane direction. Interlayer excitons have so far been mostly observed in heterostructures with a type-II band alignment. In the presence of an internal electric field, a similar alignment occurs in the alloy bilayer resulting in an efficient generation of interlayer excitons. Photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements involving circularly polarised light come up with key observations like a negative degree of circular polarization of the interlayer excitons which increases as a function of temperature. A simple theoretical model provides a physical understanding of the major experimentally observed features. With experimentally fitted parameter values, the dominant contribution to the degree of circular polarization is shown to arise from spin polarization and not from valley polarization, a consequence of the spin-valley-layer coupling characteristic of a TMDC bilayer.

Title: Intrinsic Limitation of Conductivity in Depolymerized Sodium-ion Glassy Networks
Authors: Léo Legrand, Louis-Martin Poitras, Nicolas Sator, Matthieu Micoulaut
Abstract: The electric properties of a model fast-ion electrolyte ((100-x)SiS2-xNa2S) glass are investigated by means of classical molecular dynamics simulations. These systems appear promising for battery applications and the conductivity is thought to be essentially driven by the concentration of charge carriers (Na) so that the usual amount is found to be of about 50% < x < 80%. We first set up a Buckingham-Coulomb type potential that describes the atomic structure and experimental structure functions (structure factor) in an improved fashion with respect to previous reported force fields. A systematic investigation of properties with modifier content Na2S permits to acknowledge an unexpected result which manifests by a near constant of conductivity upon Na2S for various isotherms in the liquid state. The analysis indicates that unlike Li-based electrolytes, the diffusivity difference between networks species (Si,S) and modifier (Na) is too small so that the contribution to conductivity is essentially driven by the former. The main reason is the reduction of the concentration of network species in the range 66% < x < 80% without any dramatic increase in Na diffusivity, and the emergence of molecular Na2S in the structure at large modifier content which also induces profound structural changes. Unlike Lithium glassy electrolytes, the design of Na-based batteries must, therefore, take into account the contribution of the network species.

Title: Mutual friction and vortex Hall angle in a strongly interacting Fermi superfluid
Authors: Nicola Grani, Diego Hernández-Rajkov, Cyprien Daix, Pierbiagio Pieri, Michele Pini, Piotr Magierski, Gabriel Wlazłowski, Marcia Frómeta Fernández, Francesco Scazza, Giulia Del Pace, Giacomo Roati
Abstract: The motion of a quantized vortex is intimately connected with its microscopic structure and the elementary excitations of the surrounding fluid. In this work, we investigate the two-dimensional motion of a single vortex orbiting a pinned anti-vortex in a unitary Fermi superfluid at varying temperature. By analyzing its trajectory, we measure the yet-unknown longitudinal and transverse mutual friction coefficients, which quantify the vortex-mediated coupling between the normal and superfluid components. Both coefficients increase while approaching the superfluid transition. They provide access to the vortex Hall angle, which is linked to the relaxation time of the localized quasiparticles occupying Andreev bound states within the vortex core, as well as the intrinsic superfluid parameter associated with the transition from laminar to quantum turbulent flows. We compare our results with numerical simulations and an analytic model originally formulated for superfluid $^3$He in the low-temperature limit, finding good agreement. Our work highlights the interplay between vortex-bound quasiparticles and delocalized thermal excitations in shaping vortex dynamics in unitary Fermi superfluids. Further, it provides a novel testbed for studying out-of-equilibrium vortex matter at finite temperatures.

Title: Shear Strain-Induced Multiferroic Response in the Altermagnetic Semiconductor CuFeS$_2$
Authors: Roman Malyshev, Bjørnulf Brekke, Ingeborg-Helene Svenum, Sverre M. Selbach, Christoph Brüne, Arne Brataas, Thomas Tybell
Abstract: CuFeS$_2$ is an altermagnetic semiconductor that is lattice-matched with silicon and has a high Néel temperature. It is nonpolar and magnetically compensated in its structural ground state. However, the crystal belongs to a magnetic symmetry class allowing simultaneous piezoelectricity and -magnetism, indicating that distortion by shear strain may enable functional properties not observed in its tetragonal ground state. This first-principles study explores how biaxial and shear strain affect the crystal structure and functional properties. Biaxial strain lowers crystal symmetry when applied to two of the three crystallographic {001} planes considered, enhancing the altermagnetic lifting of the Kramers degeneracy. Shear strain has a compressive effect on the crystal, enhancing the effects on the electronic structure seen under biaxial compressive strain. Applying it to any one of the three {001} planes induces a polar phase with an out-of-plane electric polarization, perpendicular to the strained plane. Moreover, applying shear strain to two out of the three {001} planes induces a net magnetization simultaneously with electric polarization, producing a multiferroic response.

Title: Effects of non-equilibrium in ultrafast irradiation of matter
Authors: Nikita Medvedev
Abstract: This proceeding discusses nonequilibrium effects in matter exposed to XUV/X-ray irradiation. When ultrashort, intense XUV/X-ray pulses interact with materials, they trigger a complex sequence of processes, including electronic excitation, nonequilibrium electron kinetics, energy exchange with the atomic system, electronic thermalization, and subsequent atomic dynamics. These effects were investigated using XTANT-3, a hybrid simulation tool that simultaneously models all relevant dynamics. XTANT-3 integrates (a) a Monte Carlo transport method for photon absorption and fast electron kinetics, (b) the Boltzmann equation for nonequilibrium slow electron dynamics, (c) a transferable tight-binding approach for electronic structure evolution and interatomic potential modeling, and (d) molecular dynamics for atomic system response. This approach enables a detailed study of nonequilibrium effects in each subsystem and their interplay with nonthermal damage, where electronic excitation alters the interatomic potential. Methods of quantifying the nonequilibrium in the electronic and atomic subsystems are discussed.

Title: Odd Droplets: Fluids with Odd Viscosity and Highly Deformable Interfaces
Authors: Hugo França, Maziyar Jalaal
Abstract: Flows with deformable interfaces are commonly controlled by applying an external field or modifying the boundaries that interact with the fluid, but realizing such solutions can be demanding or impractical in various scenarios. Here, we demonstrate that fluids with broken symmetries can self-control their mechanics. We present a continuum model of a viscous fluid with highly deformable interfaces subject to capillary stresses. Our model features odd viscosity, a parity-violating property that emerges in chiral fluids. Using direct numerical simulations, we focus on the impact of an odd droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. We demonstrate that odd viscosity dramatically disrupts conventional symmetric spreading by inducing asymmetric deformations and chiral flow patterns. Our analysis reveals a variety of dynamic regimes, including leftward and rightward bouncing, as well as rolling, depending on the relative strength of the odd viscosity. Our work illustrates that regulating odd viscosity provides a promising framework for controlling multiphase flows and designing functional metamaterials with tailored fluidic properties.

Title: Electronic structure dimensionality of the quantum-critical ferromagnet YbNi$_4$P$_2$

Abstract: YbNi$_4$P$_2$ is the first known ferromagnetic metal showing a second-order quantum phase transition. Current theoretical understanding rules out second order ferromagnetic quantum criticality in centrosymmetric 2D and 3D metals. Thus, studying the electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$ is of prime fundamental importance. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we experimentally prove the existence of 1D Fermi surface contours. In addition, our results demonstrate that part of the electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$ is made of states of higher dimensionality, thereby bringing into question the fact that ferromagnetic quantum criticality in centrosymmetric crystals, is exclusively found in 1D systems. Our experimental data show that the electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$ is a playground of mixed dimensionality, electron correlations, strong hybridization and spin-orbit coupling, all of them providing new insights in understanding the origin of ferromagnetic quantum criticality.

Title: Anisotropic light-tailored RKKY interaction in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets
Authors: Mohsen Yarmohammadi, Ulrich Zülicke, Jamal Berakdar, Jacob Linder, James K. Freericks
Abstract: Altermagnets are known in spintronics for their intrinsic spin-splitting and unconventional magnetic responses, particularly to magnetic impurities. However, effectively controlling the magnetic exchange interactions in altermagnets is challenging for practical applications. Here, we propose using circularly polarized light to tune the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. Using the real-space retarded Green's functions approach, our results show that while the Heisenberg and Ising exchanges dominate, a notable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction also plays a key role. Furthermore, the inherent strength of altermagnetism imprints chirp-like signatures into the magnetic responses, which can be dynamically tuned via light. We mainly demonstrate that gate-induced Rashba spin-orbit coupling is essential in response to light -- light selectively and anisotropically adjusts the DM interaction without affecting the other exchanges. Our findings further indicate that rotating the altermagnet by $45^\circ$ relative to the light's polarization direction generates a Dirac-like dispersion and different DM interactions. We finally extract critical thresholds where light reverses DM interactions along one axis or balances both in-plane components. The anisotropic light-driven control of RKKY interactions in 2D altermagnets not only highlights their unique properties but also opens new avenues for engineering tailored magnetic characteristics in spintronic applications.

Title: Machine Learning Assisted Modeling of Amorphous TiO$_2$-Doped GeO$_2$ for Advanced LIGO Mirror Coatings
Authors: Jun Jiang, Rui Zhang, Kiran Prasai, Riccardo Bassiri, James N. Fry, Martin M. Fejer, Hai-Ping Cheng
Abstract: The mechanical loss angle of amorphous TiO$_2$-doped GeO$_2$ can be lower than 10$^{-4}$, making it a candidate for Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) mirror coatings. Amorphous oxides have complex atomic structures that are influenced by various factors, including doping concentration, preparation, and thermal history, resulting in different mass densities and physical properties. Modeling at atomistic level enables capturing these effects by generating atomic structure models according to experimental conditions. In order to obtain reliable and physical amorphous models at an affordable cost, we develop classical and machine-learning potentials (MLP) to speed up simulations. First-principles calculations are used to train and validate MLP as well as validating structure models. To better reproduce properties such as elastic modulus, radial distribution function (RDF) and the variations in mass density of doped amorphous oxides, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to optimize the final models. We find that the mass densities of amorphous systems are correlated with the total void volume. The experimental mass density matches the models with the most symmetric potential energy wells under volume change. The elastic response of the metal-oxygen network is also studied. The 27\% TiO$_2$ doped GeO$_2$ system shows the least number of large atom-atom distance changes, while for 44\% TiO$_2$ doped GeO$_2$, a majority of Ti-O distances are significantly changed. In response to strains, the metal-oxygen network at low mass densities prefers to adjust bond angles, while at high mass densities, the adjustment is mainly done by changing atom-atom distance.

Title: Heterostructure Effects on the Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy Energy of MnN
Authors: Robert A. Lawrence, Matt I.J. Probert
Abstract: Thin film effects on the Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy Energy (MAE) of MnN were studied using density functional theory (DFT). Initially, strain effects on bulk MnN were considered as a proxy for lattice-matching induced strain and a linear relationship between the c/a ratio and the MAE was found. This relationship was explained in terms of underlying point group symmetry. Strain and charge-transfer effects were then considered for an ultra-thin film. It was found that a Ta seed-layer suppresses the net spin moment on the Mn ions, leading to a reduction of the MAE.

Title: Optical control of orbital magnetism in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Eylon Persky, Minhao He, Jiaqi Cai, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Xiaodong Xu, Aharon Kapitulnik
Abstract: Flat bands in graphene-based moiré structures host a wide range of emerging strongly correlated and topological phenomena. Optically probing and controlling them can reveal important information such as symmetry and dynamics, but have so far been challenging due to the small energy gap compared to optical wavelengths. Here, we report near infrared optical control of orbital magnetism and associated anomalous Hall effects (AHE) in a magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) on monolayer WSe$_2$ device. We show that the properties of the AHE, such as hysteresis and amplitude, can be controlled by light near integer moiré fillings, where spontaneous ferromagnetism exists. By modulating the light helicity, we observe periodic modulation of the transverse resistance in a wide range of fillings, indicating light induced orbital magnetization through a large inverse Faraday effect. At the transition between metallic and AHE regimes, we also reveal large and random switching of the Hall resistivity, which are attributed to optical control of percolating cluster of magnetic domains. Our results open the door to optical manipulation of correlation and topology in MATBG and related structures.

Title: Phases with non-invertible symmetries in 1+1D $\unicode{x2013}$ symmetry protected topological orders as duality automorphisms
Authors: Ömer M. Aksoy, Xiao-Gang Wen
Abstract: We explore 1+1 dimensional (1+1D) gapped phases in systems with non-invertible symmetries, focusing on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases (defined as gapped phases with non-degenerate ground states), as well as SPT orders (defined as the differences between gapped/gapless phases with identical bulk excitations spectrum). For group-like symmetries, distinct SPT phases share identical bulk excitations and always differ by SPT orders. However, for certain non-invertible symmetries, we discover novel SPT phases that have different bulk excitations and thus do not differ by SPT orders. Additionally, we also study the spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of non-invertible symmetries. Unlike group-like symmetries, non-invertible symmetries lack the concept of subgroups, which complicates the definition of SSB phases as well as their identification. This challenge can be addressed by employing the symmetry-topological-order (symTO) framework for the symmetry. The Lagrangian condensable algebras and automorphisms of the symTO facilitate the classification of gapped phases in systems with such symmetries, enabling the analysis of both SPT and SSB phases (including those that differ by SPT orders). Finally, we apply this methodology to investigate gapless phases in symmetric systems and to study gapless phases differing by SPT orders.

Title: Kondo-lattice phenomenology of twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ from compact molecular orbitals of topological bands
Authors: Fang Xie, Chenyuan Li, Jennifer Cano, Qimiao Si
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity and correlated electronic phases in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ (Xia et al., Nature 2024; Guo et al., Nature 2025) has generated considerable excitement. Accompanying the superconductivity and a correlated insulator phase is the Kondo-lattice-like phenomenology in transport properties. Here we consider how such phenomenology can develop when the combination of the active bands are topological. We advance a unique construction of compact molecular orbitals through a partial Wannierization that is symmetry preserving. The resulting Anderson lattice model provides the basis for a microscopic understanding of the experimental observation, including the involved energy scales. Our approach may apply to a broad range of settings where topology and correlations interplay.

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) based quantum sensors hold great potential for real-time single-cell sensing with far-reaching applications in fundamental biology and medical diagnostics. Although highly sensitive, the mapping of quantum measurements onto cellular physiological states has remained an exceptional challenge. Here we introduce a novel quantum sensing modality capable of detecting changes in cellular activity. Our approach is based on the detection of environment-induced charge depletion within an individual particle that, owing to a previously unaccounted transverse dipole term, induces systematic shifts in the zero-field splitting (ZFS). Importantly, these charge-induced shifts serve as a reliable indicator for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammatory response in macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that surface modification of our diamond nanoprobes effectively suppresses these environment-induced ZFS shifts, providing an important tool for differentiating electrostatic shifts caused by the environment from other unrelated effects, such as temperature variations. Notably, this surface modification also leads to significant reductions in particle-induced toxicity and inflammation. Our findings shed light on systematic drifts and sensitivity limits of NV spectroscopy in a biological environment with ramification on the critical discussion surrounding single-cell thermogenesis. Notably, this work establishes the foundation for a novel sensing modality capable of probing complex cellular processes through straightforward physical measurements.

Title: Additivity, Haag duality, and non-invertible symmetries
Authors: Shu-Heng Shao, Jonathan Sorce, Manu Srivastava
Abstract: The algebraic approach to quantum field theory focuses on the properties of local algebras, whereas the study of (possibly non-invertible) global symmetries emphasizes global aspects of the theory and spacetime. We study connections between these two perspectives by examining how either of two core algebraic properties -- "additivity" or "Haag duality" -- is violated in a 1+1D CFT or lattice model restricted to the symmetric sector of a general global symmetry. For the Verlinde symmetry of a bosonic diagonal RCFT, we find that additivity is violated whenever the symmetry algebra contains an invertible element, while Haag duality is violated whenever it contains a non-invertible element. We find similar phenomena for the Kramers-Wannier and Rep(D$_8$) non-invertible symmetries on spin chains.

Title: Non-invertible symmetries of two-dimensional Non-Linear Sigma Models
Authors: Guillermo Arias-Tamargo, Chris Hull, Maxwell L. Velásquez Cotini Hutt
Abstract: Global symmetries can be generalised to transformations generated by topological operators, including cases in which the topological operator does not have an inverse. A family of such topological operators are intimately related to dualities via the procedure of half-space gauging. In this work we discuss the construction of non-invertible defects based on T-duality in two dimensions, generalising the well-known case of the free compact boson to any Non-Linear Sigma Model with Wess-Zumino term which is T-dualisable. This requires that the target space has an isometry with compact orbits that acts without fixed points. Our approach allows us to include target spaces without non-trivial 1-cycles, does not require the NLSM to be conformal, and when it is conformal it does not need to be rational; moreover, it highlights the microscopic origin of the topological terms that are responsible for the non-invertibility of the defect. An interesting class of examples are Wess-Zumino-Witten models, which are self-dual under a discrete gauging of a subgroup of the isometry symmetry and so host a topological defect line with Tambara-Yamagami fusion. Along the way, we discuss how the usual 0-form symmetries match across T-dual models in target spaces without 1-cycles, and how global obstructions can prevent locally conserved currents from giving rise to topological operators.

Abstract: The utility of near-term quantum computers for simulating realistic quantum systems hinges on the stability of digital quantum matter--realized when discrete quantum gates approximate continuous time evolution--and whether it can be maintained at system sizes and time scales inaccessible to classical simulations. Here, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to simulate digitized dynamics of the quantum Ising model and observe the emergence of Floquet prethermalization on timescales where accurate simulations using current classical methods are extremely challenging (if feasible at all). In addition to confirming the stability of dynamics subject to achievable digitization errors, we show direct evidence of the resultant local equilibration by computing diffusion constants associated with an emergent hydrodynamic description of the dynamics. Our results were enabled by continued advances in two-qubit gate quality (native partial entangler fidelities of 99.94(1)%) that allow us to access circuit volumes of over 2000 two-qubit gates. This work establishes digital quantum computers as powerful tools for studying continuous-time dynamics and demonstrates their potential to benchmark classical heuristics in a regime of scale and complexity where no known classical methods are both efficient and trustworthy.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate a single fluorescent molecule as a hybrid quantum optical device, in which multiple external laser sources exert control of the vibronic states. In the high-saturation regime, a coherent interaction is established between the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom, and molecules can simulate several cavity QED models, whereby a specific vibrational mode plays the role of the cavity mode. Focusing on the specific example where the system is turned into an analogue simulator of the quantum Rabi model, the steady state exhibits vibrational bi-modality resulting in a statistical mixture of highly non-classical vibronic cat states. Applying our paradigm to molecules with prominent spatial asymmetry and combining an optical excitation with a THz(IR) driving, the system can be turned into a single photon transducer. Two possible implementations are discussed based on the coupling to a subwavelength THz patch antenna or a resonant metamaterial. In a nutshell, this work assesses the role of molecules as an optomechanical quantum toolbox for creating hybrid entangled states of electrons, photons, and vibrations, hence enabling frequency conversion over very different energy scales.

Title: Stabilizer Entanglement as a Magic Highway
Authors: Zong-Yue Hou, ChunJun Cao, Zhi-Cheng Yang
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness is a key resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet its interplay with entanglement in dynamical settings remains underexplored. We study a well-controlled, analytically tractable setup that isolates entanglement generation from magic injection. We analytically and numerically demonstrate that stabilizer entanglement functions as a highway that facilitates the spreading of locally injected magic throughout the entire system. Specifically, for an initial stabilizer state with bipartite entanglement $E$, the total magic growth, quantified by the linear stabilizer entropy $Y$, follows $\overline{Y}\propto 2^{-|A|-E}$ under a Haar random unitary on a local subregion $A$. Moreover, when applying a tensor product of local Haar random unitaries, the resulting state's global magic approaches that of a genuine Haar random state if the initial stabilizer state is sufficiently entangled by a system-size-independent amount. Similar results are also obtained for tripartite stabilizer entanglement. We further extend our analysis to non-stabilizer entanglement and magic injection via a shallow-depth brickwork circuit, and find that the qualitative picture of our conclusion remains unchanged.

Title: Quantum Coherence of Topologically Frustrated Spin Chains
Authors: S. B. Kožić, G. Torre, K. Delić, F. Franchini, S. M. Giampaolo
Abstract: The study of entanglement and magic properties in topologically frustrated systems suggests that, in the thermodynamic limit, these quantities decompose into two distinct contributions. One is determined by the specific nature of the model and its Hamiltonian, and another arises from topological frustration itself, resulting in being independent of the Hamiltonian's parameters. In this work, we test the generality of this picture by investigating an additional quantum resource, namely quantum coherence, in two different models where topological frustration is induced through an appropriate choice of boundary conditions. Our findings reveal a perfect analogy between the behavior of quantum coherence and that of other quantum resources, particularly magic, providing further evidence in support of the universality of this picture and the topological nature of this source of frustration.

Title: Solvable Quantum Circuits in Tree+1 Dimensions
Authors: Oliver Breach, Benedikt Placke, Pieter W. Claeys, S.A. Parameswaran
Abstract: We devise tractable models of unitary quantum many-body dynamics on tree graphs, as a first step towards a deeper understanding of dynamics in non-Euclidean spaces. To this end, we first demonstrate how to construct strictly local quantum circuits that preserve the symmetries of trees, such that their dynamical light cones grow isotropically. We show that, for trees with coordination number z, such circuits can be built from z-site gates. We then introduce a family of gates for which the dynamics is exactly solvable; these satisfy a set of constraints that we term 'tree-unitarity'. Notably, tree-unitarity reduces to the previously-established notion of dual-unitarity for z=2, when the tree reduces to a line. Among the unexpected features of tree-unitarity is a trade-off between 'maximum velocity' dynamics of out-of-time-order correlators and the existence of non-vanishing correlation functions in multiple directions, a tension absent in one-dimensional dual-unitary models and their Euclidean generalizations. We give various examples of tree-unitary gates, discuss dynamical correlations, out-of-time-order correlators, and entanglement growth, and show that the kicked Ising model on a tree is a physically-motivated example of maximum-velocity tree-unitary dynamics.

Title: Least Squares as Random Walks
Authors: Alexander Kostinski, Glenn Ierley, Sarah Kostinski
Abstract: Linear least squares (LLS) is perhaps the most common method of data analysis, dating back to Legendre, Gauss and Laplace. Framed as linear regression, LLS is also a backbone of mathematical statistics. Here we report on an unexpected new connection between LLS and random walks. To that end, we introduce the notion of a random walk based on a discrete sequence of data samples (data walk). We show that the slope of a straight line which annuls the net area under a residual data walk equals the one found by LLS. For equidistant data samples this result is exact and holds for an arbitrary distribution of steps.

Title: Host-dependent frequency offsets in $^{229}$Th nuclear clockwork
Authors: U. C. Perera, H. W. T. Morgan, Eric R. Hudson, Andrei Derevianko
Abstract: Recent advances in laser excitation of the low-energy nuclear isomer transition in $^{229}$Th have opened avenues for developing nuclear clocks, a novel quantum technology with exceptional performance and sensitivity to exotic physics. Here we explore the host-dependence of the nuclear clock frequency, focusing on the isomer shift induced by the difference in the nuclear charge distribution between the ground and excited nuclear states. We combine relativistic many-body methods of atomic structure with periodic density functional theory to evaluate the isomer shifts in solid-state hosts. Our analysis predicts nuclear clock frequencies for various solid-state and trapped ion platforms: $ \omega_\text{clk}(\text{solid state}) = 2,020,407,384(40) \, \text{MHz}$, $\omega_\text{clk}($$^{229}$Th$^{4+}) = 2,020,407,648(70) \, \text{MHz}$, and $\omega_\text{clk}(^{229}\text{Th}{3+})= 2,020,407,114(70) \, \text{MHz}$. We also determine the nuclear transition energy for the bare $^{229}$Th nucleus to be $\omega_\text{nuc} = 8.272(22) \,\text{eV}$. Our calculated valence-band isomer shifts for different host materials constrain the nuclear transition frequencies to an 80 MHz-wide frequency window, aiding experimental searches for the $^{229}$Th nuclear transition in novel materials.

Title: Optimal Rejection-Free Path Sampling
Authors: Gianmarco Lazzeri, Peter G. Bolhuis, Roberto Covino
Abstract: We propose an efficient novel path sampling-based framework designed to accelerate the investigation of rare events in complex molecular systems. A key innovation is the shift from sampling restricted path ensemble distributions, as in transition path sampling, to directly sampling the distribution of shooting points. This allows for a rejection-free algorithm that samples the entire path ensemble efficiently. Optimal sampling is achieved by applying a selection bias that is the inverse of the free energy along a reaction coordinate. The optimal reaction coordinate, the committor, is iteratively constructed as a neural network using AI for Molecular Mechanism Discovery (AIMMD), concurrently with the free energy profile, which is obtained through reweighting the sampled path ensembles. We showcase our algorithm on theoretical and molecular bechnmarks, and demonstrate how it provides at the same time molecular mechanism, free energy, and rates at a moderate computational cost.

Title: Exponential quantum speedups in quantum chemistry with linear depth
Authors: Oskar Leimkuhler, K. Birgitta Whaley
Abstract: We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term quantum chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum multi-reference methods designed for near-term quantum hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of reference state that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and unitary coupled-cluster with single and double excitations. In each case we discuss the implications for achieving exponential quantum advantage in quantum chemistry on near-term hardware.

Title: Computer simulations of the bacterial ribosome using a general purpose coarse-grained model MARTINI
Authors: Josef Cikhart, Aneta Leskourová, Michal H. Kolář
Abstract: Ribosomes are critical biomolecular nanomachines responsible for protein synthesis in all known organisms. The function and dynamics of ribosomes can be studied using molecular dynamics computer simulations. Although this task remains challenging at atomic level, several studies have reported all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the entire ribosome. However, for certain applications, atomistic simulations are impractical due to the limited simulation timescales achievable. In this study, we investigate the applicability of the coarse-grained MARTINI model for simulations of the bacterial ribosome. After testing several simulation setups, we found that the structure of the ribosome and its components are generally well represented compared to the reference experimental structure. Compared with all-atom simulations of the entire ribosome, coarse-grained simulations result in a less flexible and smaller ribosome. We demonstrate how modifications of some parameters of the model can enhance the dynamics of the ribosome to better align with the atomistic model. Our work provides a detailed protocol for coarse-grained simulations of the ribosome and highlights aspects of the model that need improvements.

Title: Statistics of the Random Matrix Spectral Form Factor
Authors: Alex Altland, Francisco Divi, Tobias Micklitz, Silvia Pappalardi, Maedeh Rezaei
Abstract: The spectral form factor of random matrix theory plays a key role in the description of disordered and chaotic quantum systems. While its moments are known to be approximately Gaussian, corrections subleading in the matrix dimension, $D$, have recently come to attention, with conflicting results in the literature. In this work, we investigate these departures from Gaussianity for both circular and Gaussian ensembles. Using two independent approaches -- sine-kernel techniques and supersymmetric field theory -- we identify the form factor statistics to next leading order in a $D^{-1}$ expansion. Our sine-kernel analysis highlights inconsistencies with previous studies, while the supersymmetric approach backs these findings and suggests an understanding of the statistics from a complementary perspective. Our findings fully agree with numerics. They are presented in a pedagogical way, highlighting new pathways (and pitfalls) in the study of statistical signatures at next leading order, which are increasingly becoming important in applications.

Title: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Phase Transition in Free Fermion Chains
Authors: Han-Ze Li, Jian-Xin Zhong, Xue-Jia Yu
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions (MIET) highlight how local measurements drive quantum systems between area-law and volume-law entangled states. This review surveys MIET in free fermion models, focusing on how unitary hopping competes with measurement-induced non-unitarity. We discuss controversies regarding the existence of measurement-induced entanglement phase transition in one dimension, the impact of non-Hermitian skin effects, and potential experimental platforms. We conclude with open challenges, including feedback control and higher-dimensional extensions.

Title: The Fe-Ni phase diagram and the Earth's inner core structure
Authors: Liangrui Wei, Kai-Ming Ho, Renata M. Wentzcovitch, Yang Sun
Abstract: The Fe-Ni alloy is believed to be the main component of Earth's core. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of phase equilibria near the melting point of this alloy under core conditions is still lacking, leaving the effect of nickel inconclusive. Using ab initio simulations, we computed Gibbs free energy and phase diagram for liquid and solid solutions of the Fe-Ni alloy under conditions close to the inner core, considering inner-shell electron contributions and non-ideal mixing effects. The Fe-Ni phase diagram provides crucial insights for understanding previous experimental observations and crystallization simulations of the Fe-Ni alloy under core conditions. It also presents new scenarios for inner core structures, suggesting bcc-liquid coexistence at the inner core boundary and the possibility of multi-layer structures consisting of bcc-hcp composites within the inner core. Our work clarifies nickel's substantial impact on the inner core structure, providing new constraints for the study of core's composition and formation.

Title: Gauging $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries of Narain CFTs
Authors: Keiichi Ando, Kohki Kawabata, Tatsuma Nishioka
Abstract: We investigate the gauging of a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry in lattice conformal field theories (CFTs), also known as Narain CFTs. For prime $N$, we derive a spin selection rule for operators in a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ charge-twisted sector of a general bosonic CFT. Using this result, we formulate the gauging procedures in lattice CFTs as modifications of the momentum lattices by a lattice vector that specifies a non-anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry. Applying this formulation to code CFTs, i.e., Narain CFTs constructed from error-correcting codes, we express the torus partition functions of the orbifolded and parafermionized theories in terms of the weight enumerator polynomials of the underlying codes. As an application, we identify a class of codes that yield self-dual bosonic CFTs under the orbifolding by a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry.

Title: Exploring the Energy Landscape of RBMs: Reciprocal Space Insights into Bosons, Hierarchical Learning and Symmetry Breaking
Authors: J. Quetzalcóatl Toledo-Marin, Anindita Maiti, Geoffrey C. Fox, Roger G. Melko
Abstract: Deep generative models have become ubiquitous due to their ability to learn and sample from complex distributions. Despite the proliferation of various frameworks, the relationships among these models remain largely unexplored, a gap that hinders the development of a unified theory of AI learning. We address two central challenges: clarifying the connections between different deep generative models and deepening our understanding of their learning mechanisms. We focus on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), known for their universal approximation capabilities for discrete distributions. By introducing a reciprocal space formulation, we reveal a connection between RBMs, diffusion processes, and coupled Bosons. We show that at initialization, the RBM operates at a saddle point, where the local curvature is determined by the singular values, whose distribution follows the Marcenko-Pastur law and exhibits rotational symmetry. During training, this rotational symmetry is broken due to hierarchical learning, where different degrees of freedom progressively capture features at multiple levels of abstraction. This leads to a symmetry breaking in the energy landscape, reminiscent of Landau theory. This symmetry breaking in the energy landscape is characterized by the singular values and the weight matrix eigenvector matrix. We derive the corresponding free energy in a mean-field approximation. We show that in the limit of infinite size RBM, the reciprocal variables are Gaussian distributed. Our findings indicate that in this regime, there will be some modes for which the diffusion process will not converge to the Boltzmann distribution. To illustrate our results, we trained replicas of RBMs with different hidden layer sizes using the MNIST dataset. Our findings bridge the gap between disparate generative frameworks and also shed light on the processes underpinning learning in generative models.

Title: Amplifying solid-state high harmonic generations with momentum k-gaps in band structure engineering
Authors: Yiming Pan, Danni Chen, Xiaoxi Xu, Zhaopin Chen, Huaiqiang Wang
Abstract: We propose a novel amplification mechanism for high harmonic generation (HHG) in solids by leveraging bandgap engineering with momentum k-gaps. By constructing a simple diatomic lattice featuring balanced, alternating gain and loss profiles, facilitated by an array of four-level systems, we explore the physics of k-gap-amplified Bloch oscillations in the intraband channel of solid-state HHG. Through numerical simulations, we elucidate the coexistence of amplification and harmonic radiation processes in a solid. Our finding reveals that advanced bandgap engineering can define k-space optical devices - such as Brillouin cavity, Bloch-Zener oscillator and k-gap amplifier - thereby enabling the coherent manipulation of semiconductor radiation and high harmonic generation in both semiconductor superlattices and artificial materials. Furthermore, we analyze the spectrogram and material realizations required for amplifying solid-state HHG. These results underscore the potential of k-gap band structure engineering to advance coherent light sources at extremely short wavelengths.

Title: Synchronization and chaos in complex ecological communities with delayed interactions
Authors: Francesco Ferraro, Christian Grilletta, Emanuele Pigani, Samir Suweis, Sandro Azaele, Amos Maritan
Abstract: Explaining the wide range of dynamics observed in ecological communities is challenging due to the large number of species involved, the complex network of interactions among them, and the influence of multiple environmental variables. Here, we consider a general framework to model the dynamics of species-rich communities under the effects of external environmental factors, showing that it naturally leads to delayed interactions between species, and analyze the impact of such memory effects on population dynamics. Employing the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations with time delays and random interactions, we characterize the resulting dynamical phases in terms of the statistical properties of community interactions. Our findings reveal that memory effects can generate persistent and synchronized oscillations in species abundances in sufficiently competitive communities. This provides an additional explanation for synchronization in large communities, complementing known mechanisms such as predator-prey cycles and environmental periodic variability. Furthermore, we show that when reciprocal interactions are negatively correlated, time delays alone can induce chaotic behavior. This suggests that ecological complexity is not a prerequisite for unpredictable population dynamics, as intrinsic memory effects are sufficient to generate long-term fluctuations in species abundances. The techniques developed in this work are applicable to any high-dimensional random dynamical system with time delays.

Title: Prethermalization by Random Multipolar Driving on a 78-Qubit Superconducting Processor

Abstract: Time-dependent drives hold the promise of realizing non-equilibrium many-body phenomena that are absent in undriven systems. Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the first experimental observation of the long-lived prethermal phases with tunable heating rates in many-body systems, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by the $n$-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and the subsystem entanglement entropy, we trace out the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and confirm the existence of the prethermal plateau. Its lifetime grows algebraically with the driving frequency and the scaling exponent is approximately $2n{+}1$, tunable by the multipolar order. Using quantum state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from the area-law to the volume-law entanglement scaling. We utilize all 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a 2D configuration, and their entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work underscores superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems.

Title: Superfluid density in linear response theory : pulsar glitches from the inner crust of neutron stars
Authors: Giorgio Almirante, Michael Urban
Abstract: The question of whether there are enough superfluid neutrons in the inner crust of neutron stars to explain pulsar glitches remains a topic of debate. Previous band structure calculations suggest that the entrainment effect significantly reduces the superfluid density. In this letter, a new derivation of the BCS expression for the superfluid density is given. We compute it in the superfluid band theory framework through linear response theory, for a small relative velocity between superfluid and normal components, under the assumption that the pairing gap in the rest frame of the superfluid is constant and not affected by the perturbation. Our result suggests that a formula extensively used in neutron star physics is incomplete. Numerical evaluations for two realistic configurations reveal that the previously neglected contribution drastically alters the picture of the superfluid reservoir in the inner crust of neutron stars, suggesting that about 90% of the neutrons are effectively superfluid.

Title: Fracton and Non-Lorentzian Particle Duality: Gauge Field Couplings and Geometric Implications
Authors: M.M. Ahmadi-Jahmani, A. Parvizi
Abstract: Fractons, characterized by restricted mobility and governed by higher-moment conservation laws, represent a novel phase of matter with deep connections to tensor gauge theories and emergent gravity. This work systematically explores the duality between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles -- Carroll and Galilean -- within electromagnetic (EM) fields. By constructing canonical actions for fractons in rank-2 gauge fields, we derive their equations of motion and demonstrate that static fractons exhibit duality with electric-sector of Carroll particles, while mobile fracton dipoles correspond to both electric and magnetic sectors of Galilean particles. The algebraic underpinnings of these dualities are clarified through symmetry analyses, revealing structural parallels between the fracton and Carroll/Galilean algebras. Furthermore, by gauging the fracton algebra, we develop a geometric framework for fracton gravity, linking it to non-Lorentzian spacetime geometries. These results unify fracton dynamics with non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic limits of physics, offering insights into emergent gravity and exotic condensed matter systems.

Title: Extracting Coupling-Mode Spectral Densities with Two-Dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy
Authors: Roosmarijn de Wit, Jonathan Keeling, Brendon W. Lovett, Alex W. Chin
Abstract: Methods for reconstructing the spectral density of a vibrational environment from experimental data can yield key insights into the impact of the environment on molecular function. Although such experimental methods exist, they generally only access vibrational modes that couple diagonally to the electron system. Here we present a method for extracting the spectral density of modes that couple to the transition between electronic states, using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. To demonstrate this, we use a process-tensor method that can simulate two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy measurements in a numerically exact way. To explain how the extraction works, we also derive an approximate analytical solution, which illustrates that the non-Markovianity of the environment plays an essential role in the existence of the simulated signal.

Title: Adiabatic quantum state preparation in integrable models
Authors: Maximilian Lutz, Lorenzo Piroli, Georgios Styliaris, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: We propose applying the adiabatic algorithm to prepare high-energy eigenstates of integrable models on a quantum computer. We first review the standard adiabatic algorithm to prepare ground states in each magnetization sector of the prototypical XXZ Heisenberg chain. Based on the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, we show that the algorithm circuit depth is polynomial in the number of qubits $N$, outperforming previous methods explicitly relying on integrability. Next, we propose a protocol to prepare arbitrary eigenstates of integrable models that satisfy certain conditions. For a given target eigenstate, we construct a suitable parent Hamiltonian written in terms of a complete set of local conserved quantities. We propose using such Hamiltonian as an input for an adiabatic algorithm. After benchmarking this construction in the case of the non-interacting XY spin chain, where we can rigorously prove its efficiency, we apply it to prepare arbitrary eigenstates of the Richardson-Gaudin models. In this case, we provide numerical evidence that the circuit depth of our algorithm is polynomial in $N$ for all eigenstates, despite the models being interacting.

Title: Two-dimensional atomic-scale ultrathin lateral heterostructures
Authors: Nanami Ichinose, Mina Maruyama, Takato Hotta, Zheng Liu, Ruben Canton-Vitoria, Susumu Okada, Fanyu Zeng, Feng Zhang, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Ryo Kitaura
Abstract: Ultrathin lateral heterostructures of monolayer MoS2 and WS2 have successfully been realized with the metal-organic chemical vapor deposition method. Atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM observations have revealed that the junction widths of lateral heterostructures range from several nanometers to single-atom thickness, the thinnest heterojunction in theory. The interfaces are atomically flat with minimal mixing between MoS2 and WS2, originating from rapid and abrupt switching of the source supply. Due to one-dimensional interfaces and broken rotational symmetry, the resulting ultrathin lateral heterostructures, 1~2 mixed-dimensional structures, can show emergent optical/electronic properties. The MOCVD growth developed in this work allows us to access various ultrathin lateral heterostructures, leading to future exploration of their emergent properties absent in each component alone.

Title: Quantum entropy thermalization
Authors: Yichen Huang, Aram W. Harrow
Abstract: In an isolated quantum many-body system undergoing unitary evolution, the entropy of a subsystem (smaller than half the system size) thermalizes if at long times, it is to leading order equal to the thermodynamic entropy of the subsystem at the same energy. In this paper, we prove entropy thermalization for a nearly integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model initialized in a pure product state. The model is obtained by adding random all-to-all $4$-body interactions as a perturbation to a random free-fermion model.

Title: Biaxial nematic order in fundamental measure theory
Authors: Anouar El Moumane, Michael te Vrugt, Hartmut Löwen, René Wittmann
Abstract: Liquid crystals consisting of biaxial particles can exhibit a much richer phase behavior than their uniaxial counterparts. Usually, one has to rely on simulation results to understand the phase diagram of these systems, since very few analytical results exist. In this work, we apply fundamental measure theory, which allows us to derive free energy functionals for hard particles from first principles and with high accuracy, to systems of hard cylinders, cones and spherotriangles. We provide a general recipe for incorporating biaxial liquid crystal order parameters into fundamental measure theory and use this framework to obtain the phase boundaries for the emergence of orientational order in the considered systems. Our results provide insights into the phase behavior of biaxial nematic liquid crystals and, in particular, into methods for their analytical investigation.

Title: Optimal number of agents in a collective search, and when to launch them
Authors: Hugues Meyer, Heiko Rieger
Abstract: Search processes often involve multiple agents that collectively search a randomly located target. While increasing the number of agents usually decreases the time at which the first agent finds the target, it also requires resources to create and sustain more agents. In this manuscript, we raise the question of the optimal timing for launching multiple agents in a search in order to reach the best compromise between minimizing the overall search time and minimizing the costs associated with launching and sustaining agents. After introducing a general formalism for independent agents in which we allow them to be launched at arbitrary times, we investigate by means of analytical calculations and numerical optimization the optimal launch strategies to optimize the quantiles of the search cost and its mean. Finally, we compare our results with the case of stochastic resetting and study the conditions under which it is preferable to launch new searchers rather than resetting the first one to its initial position.

Title: Heat-charge separation in a hybrid superconducting quantum Hall setup
Authors: Carlo Panu, Fabio Taddei, Marco Polini, Amir Yacoby
Abstract: Separating heat from charge in a material is an extremely challenging task since they are transported by the very same carriers, i.e. electrons or holes. In this Letter we show that such separation can reach 100% efficiency in a hybrid superconducting quantum Hall setup, provided that the quantum Hall system is tuned to integer filling factor. We present microscopic calculations for a three-terminal setup to illustrate our idea.

Title: Electric conductivity in graphene: Kubo model versus a nonlocal quantum field theory model
Authors: Pablo Rodriguez-Lopez, Jian-Sheng Wang, Mauro Antezza
Abstract: We compare three models of graphene electric conductivity: a non-local Kubo model, a local model derived by Falkovsky, and finally, a non-local quantum field theory (QFT) polarization-based model. These models are supposed to provide consistent results since they are derived from the same Hamiltonian. While we confirm that the local model is a proper $\textbf{q}\to\textbf{0}$ limit of both the non-local Kubo and the non-local QFT model (once losses are added to this last model), we find hard inconsistencies in the non-local QFT model as derived and currently used in literature. In particular, in the genuine non-local region ($\textbf{q}\neq\textbf{0}$), the available QFT model shows an intrinsic non-physical plasma-like behavior for the interband transversal electric conductivity at low frequencies (even after introducing the unavoidable losses). The Kubo model, instead, shows the expected behavior, i.e., an almost constant electric conductivity as a function of frequency $\omega$ with a gap for frequencies $\hbar\omega<\sqrt{(\hbar v_F q)^{2}+4m^{2}}$. We show that the Kubo and QFT models can be expressed using an identical Polarization operator $\Pi_{\mu\nu}(\omega,\textbf{q})$, but they employ different expressions for the electric conductivity $\sigma_{\mu\nu}(\omega,\textbf{q})$. In particular, the Kubo model uses a standard regularized expression, a direct consequence of Ohm's Law and causality, as we rigorously re-derive. We show that, once the standard regularized expression for $\sigma_{\mu\nu}(\omega,\textbf{q})$ is used in the QFT model, and losses are included, the Kubo and QFT model coincide, and all its anomalies naturally disappear. Our findings show the necessity to appropriately define and regularize the electric conductivity to connect it with the available QFT model.

Title: Pressure effects on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of infinite-layer nickelates
Authors: Shekhar Sharma, Myung-Chul Jung, Harrison LaBollita, Antia S. Botana
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates RNiO$_2$ (R= rare-earth), and the subsequent enhancement of their T$_c$ with pressure, we investigate the evolution of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of this family of materials via first-principles calculations employing hydrostatic and chemical pressure as tuning knobs. Overall, our analysis shows that pressure tends to increase the R-$5d$ self-doping effect, as well as the Ni-$d _{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ bandwidth, the $e_g$ energy splitting, the charge transfer energy, and the superexchange ($J$). Using the energy scale of $J$ as a predictor of superconducting tendencies, we anticipate that pressure can indeed be a feasible means to further increase the T$_c$ in this family of materials.

Title: Kondo-Zeno crossover in the dynamics of a monitored quantum dot
Authors: Matthieu Vanhoecke, Marco Schirò
Abstract: Continuously monitoring a quantum system can strongly affect its properties and even suppress its coherent evolution via the Quantum Zeno effect. Well understood for few body quantum systems, the role of quantum measurements on entangled many-body states is still largely unexplored. Here we focus on one of the simplest entangled many-body state, arising via the Kondo effect in a strongly interacting quantum dot coupled to a metallic bath, and investigate the effect of continuous monitoring of the dot total charge. We show that the decay rate of an initially polarized spin displays a crossover from Kondo screening, with a decay rate controlled by interactions, to Quantum Zeno effect, with a decay rate which decreases with bare dissipation as the monitoring rate is increased. Remarkably we show that the long-lived Kondo state is robust to weak dissipation, as further confirmed by the dot spectral function which features a clear Kondo peak at finite dissipation, even in a regime where charge fluctuations and the associated Hubbard bands have been quenched by the monitoring protocol. We derive an effective model for the long-time dynamics which is described, at weak dissipation, by a non-Hermitian Kondo model with complex-valued spin exchange which is known to host exotic low-energy physics and a dissipative phase transition between Kondo and non-Kondo steady-state. Finally, as the dephasing is increased heating due to doublon production takes over and control the spin decay.

Title: Resilience of the quantum critical line in the Schmid transition
Authors: Nicolas Paris, Luca Giacomelli, Romain Daviet, Cristiano Ciuti, Nicolas Dupuis, Christophe Mora
Abstract: Schmid predicted that a single Josephson junction coupled to a resistive environment undergoes a quantum phase transition to an insulating phase when the shunt resistance $R$ exceeds the resistance quantum $h/(4 e^ 2)$. Recent measurements and theoretical studies have sparked a debate on whether the location of this transition depends on the ratio between the Josephson and the charging energies. We employ a combination of multiple innovative analytical and numerical techniques, never before explicitly applied to this problem, to decisively demonstrate that the transition line between superconducting and insulating behavior is indeed independent of this energy ratio. First, we apply field-theory renormalization group methods and find that the $\beta$ function vanishes along the critical line up to the third order in the Josephson energy. We then identify a simple fermionic model that precisely captures the low-energy physics on the critical line, regardless of the energy ratio. This conformally invariant fermionic model is verified by comparing the expected spectrum with exact diagonalization calculations of the resistively shunted Josephson junction, showing excellent agreement even for moderate system sizes. Importantly, this identification provides a rigorous non-perturbative proof that the transition line is maintained at $R=h/(4 e^ 2)$ for all ratios of Josephson to charging energies. The line is further resilient to other ultraviolet cutoffs such as the plasma frequency of the resistive environment. Finally, we implement an adiabatic approach to validate the duality at large Josephson energy.

Abstract: The complexation of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) and thermoresponsive microgels is widely exploited for applications, but a microscopic description of the mechanisms governing the spatial organization of the NPs is still lacking. Combining small angle X-ray scattering, state-of-the-art simulations and a simple toy model, we uncover how the volume phase transition of microgels controls NP-NP interactions, establishing for the first time a microscopic link between plasmon coupling and NP local structure. Our study paves the way to experimentally investigate phase transitions on controlled curved surfaces at the nanoscale.

Title: Theory of quasiparticle interference in Kitaev quantum spin liquids
Authors: Ammar Jahin, Hao Zhang, Gábor B. Halász, Shi-Zeng Lin
Abstract: We study quasiparticle interference (QPI) in the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL) for electrons tunneling into the QSL. The local tunneling conductance around a spin vacancy or localized vison reveals unique features associated with fractionalized Majorana fermions, chargons, and visons. In certain parameter regimes, the single-spinon density of states and momentum dispersion can both be directly extracted from the tunneling conductance. Our results suggest that QPI is a promising tool for identifying the Kitaev QSL and its fractionalized excitations.

Title: Generalization of the Central Limit Theorem to Critical Systems: Revisiting Perturbation Theory
Authors: Sankarshan Sahu, Bertrand Delamotte, Adam Rançon
Abstract: The Central Limit Theorem does not hold for strongly correlated stochastic variables, as is the case for statistical systems close to criticality. Recently, the calculation of the probability distribution function (PDF) of the magnetization mode has been performed with the functional renormalization group in the case of the three-dimensional Ising model [Balog et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 129}, 210602 (2022)]. It has been shown in that article that there exists an entire family of universal PDFs parameterized by $\zeta=\lim_{L,\xi_\infty\rightarrow\infty} L/\xi_\infty$ which is the ratio of the system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$ with both the thermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously. We show how these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm, can be systematically computed perturbatively in the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion. We determine the whole family of universal PDFs and show that they are in good qualitative agreement with Monte Carlo data. Finally, we conjecture on how to significantly improve the quantitative agreement between the one-loop and the numerical results.

Title: Fast, Accurate, and Local Temperature Control Using Qubits
Authors: Riya Baruah, Pedro Portugal, Joachim Wabnig, Christian Flindt
Abstract: Many quantum technologies, including quantum computers, quantum heat engines, and quantum sensors, rely on operating conditions in the subkelvin regime. It is therefore desirable to develop practical tools and methods for the precise control of the temperature in nanoscale quantum systems. Here, we present a proposal for fast, accurate, and local temperature control using qubits, which regulate the flow of heat between a quantum system and its thermal environment. The qubits are kept in a thermal state with a temperature that is controlled in an interplay between work done on the qubits by changing their energy splittings and the flow of heat between the qubits and the environment. Using only a few qubits, it is possible to control the thermal environment of another quantum system, which can be heated or cooled by the qubits. As an example, we show how a quantum system at subkelvin temperatures can be significantly and accurately cooled on a nanosecond timescale. Our proposal can potentially be realized with superconducting flux qubits, charge qubits, or spin qubits, which can now be fabricated and manipulated with exquisite control.

Title: Magnetic- and electric-field-induced anomalous Hall currents from optical excitation of Landau transitions in bulk GaAs
Authors: Christoph Dresler, Shekhar Priyadarshi, Mark Bieler
Abstract: We study a certain type of anomalous Hall current in magnetically- and electrically-biased bulk GaAs samples under the formation of Landau levels. The currents are generated by ultrafast optical excitation of spin-polarized carriers and detected by time-resolved measurements of the simultaneously emitted THz radiation. Due to the requirements of simultaneous magnetic and electric driving fields we refer to these currents as BE-AHC. We find that the BE-AHC peak for optical transitions between the band extrema of Landau levels of valance and conduction bands. These discrete features are attributed to the energy dependence of the geometric phases being responsible for anomalous transport effects in a semiconductor bandstructure. Surprisingly, we even detect the discrete Landau band transitions at room temperature, most likely due to the ultrafast local probing realized in our experiment. An analysis of the THz spectra using a model, based on the Boltzmann transport equation of optically excited carriers, shows that electron and hole contributions lead to complex current dynamics. While the cyclotronic motion of electrons results in a dip in the THz spectral response of BE-AHC, it causes a peak in the spectral response of normal Hall currents. Additionally, our experimental results strongly suggest that the Landau levels of the valance band play a significant role in the generation of BE-AHC. We expect that our results will initiate further studies on Berry-phase effects in Landau bands.

Title: Ring-exchange physics in a chain of three-level ions
Authors: Sourav Biswas, E. Rico, Tobias Grass
Abstract: In the presence of ring exchange interactions, bosons in a ladder-like lattice may form the bosonic analogon of a correlated metal, known as the d-wave Bose liquid (DBL). In this paper, we show that a chain of trapped ions with three internal levels can mimic a ladder-like system constrained to a maximum occupation of one boson per rung. The setup enables tunable ring exchange interactions, transitioning between a polarized regime with all bosons confined to one leg and the DBL regime. The latter state is characterized by a splitting of the peak in the momentum distribution and an oscillating pair correlation function.

Title: Effects of Disorder in a Single-site anisotropic XY ferromagnet: A Monte Carlo study
Authors: Olivia Mallick
Abstract: We perform Monte Carlo simulation to study the effects of random disorder on equilibrium phase transition of three-dimensional single-site anisotropic XY ferromagnet. The disorder is incorporated in two ways; having a randomly distributed anisotropy and presence of a quenched random field. The ferro-para transition temperature has been found to increase with the increase of the strength of constant (over the space) anisotropy. In contrast, the system gets ordered at lower temperatures if the anisotropy has random distribution. The effects of quenched random fields are also studied in single-site anisotropic XY ferromagnet. The transition temperature reduces due to the presence of quenched random field. The compensating field (the required amount of field which preserves the critical temperature for isotropic XY ferromagnet) linearly depends on the strength of constant single-site anisotropy. We compute the magnetic and susceptibility exponent ratios for constant single-site anisotropic XY system only via detailed finite-size scaling analysis.

Title: Monopole excitations in the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid on the triangular lattice
Authors: Sasank Budaraju, Alberto Parola, Yasir Iqbal, Federico Becca, Didier Poilblanc
Abstract: The $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid might realize an exotic phase of matter whose low-energy properties are described by quantum electrodynamics in $2+1$ dimensions, where gapless modes exists but spinons and gauge fields are strongly coupled. Its existence has been proposed in frustrated Heisenberg models in presence of frustrating super-exchange interactions, by the (Abrikosov) fermionic representation of the spin operators [X.-G. Wen, \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B {\bf 65}, 165113 (2002)}], supplemented by the Gutzwiller projection. Here, we construct charge-$Q$ monopole excitations in the Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice with nearest- ($J_1$) and next-neighbor ($J_2$) couplings. In the highly frustrated regime, singlet and triplet monopoles with $Q=1$ become gapless in the thermodynamic limit; in addition, the energies for generic $Q$ agree with field-theoretical predictions, obtained for a large number of gapless fermion modes. Finally, we consider localized gauge excitations, in which magnetic $\pi$-fluxes are concentrated in the triangular plaquettes (in analogy with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ visons), showing that these kind of states do not play a relevant role at low energies. All our findings lend support to a stable $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid in the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice.

Title: Coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior and level spacing statistics in a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor
Authors: Meri Teeriaho, Ville-Vertti Linho, Koushik Swaminathan, Sebastiano Peotta
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies of the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian [K. Swaminathan et al., Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043215 (2023)], we introduce the on-site/bond singlet (OBS) model, a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor, in order to better understand the quasiparticle localization and interesting coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior present in the former model. The OBS model is the sum of terms that have direct counterparts in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian, each of which is parameterized by a coupling constant. Exact diagonalization reveals that the energy spectrum and non-equilibrium dynamics of the OBS model are essentially the same as that of the dice lattice for some values of the coupling constants. The quasiparticle localization and breaking of ergodicity manifest in a striking manner in the level spacing distribution. Its near Poissonian form provides evidence for the existence of local integrals of motion and establishes the OBS model as a non-trivial integrable generalization of the projected Creutz ladder Hamiltonian. These results show that level spacing statistics is a promising tool to study quasiparticle excitations in flat band superconductors.

Title: 2D Hexagonal Boron Nitride-based Anticorrosion Coatings
Authors: Onurcan Kaya, Luca Gabatel, Sebastiano Bellani, Fabrizio Barberis, Francesco Bonaccorso, Ivan Cole, Stephan Roche
Abstract: The corrosion of metallic surfaces poses significant challenges across industries such as petroleum, energy, and biomedical sectors, leading to structural degradation, safety risks, and substantial maintenance costs. Traditional organic and metallic coatings provide some protection, but their limited durability and susceptibility to harsh environmental conditions necessitate the development of more advanced and efficient solutions. This has driven significant interest in two-dimensional (2D) materials, with graphene extensively studied for its exceptional mechanical strength and impermeability to gases and ions. However, while graphene offers short-term corrosion protection, its high electrical conductivity presents a long-term issue by promoting galvanic corrosion on metal surfaces. In contrast, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has emerged as a promising alternative for anticorrosion coatings. h-BN combines exceptional chemical stability, impermeability, and electrical insulation, making it particularly suited for long-term protection in highly corrosive or high-temperature environments. While h-BN holds promise as anticorrosion material, challenges such as structural defects, agglomeration of nanosheets, and poor dispersion within coatings limit its performance. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent advancements in addressing these challenges, including novel functionalization strategies, scalable synthesis methods, and hybrid systems that integrate h-BN with complementary materials. By bridging the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications, this review outlines the potential for h-BN to revolutionize anticorrosion technologies. These obstacles necessitate advanced strategies such as surface functionalization to improve compatibility with polymer matrices and dispersion optimization to minimize agglomeration.

Title: Strange metal transport from coupling to fluctuating spins
Authors: Simone Fratini, Arnaud Ralko, Sergio Ciuchi
Abstract: Metals hosting strong electronic interactions, including high-temperature superconductors, behave in ways that do not conform to the normal Fermi liquid theory. To pinpoint the microscopic origin of this "strange metal" behavior, here we reexamine the d.c. and frequency-dependent conductivity of the two-dimensional t-J model taking advantage of recent improvements made on the finite temperature Lanczos method, enabling numerically exact calculations at unprecedentedly low temperatures and high spectral resolution. We find that strange metallicity is pervasive in the temperature-doping phase diagram wherever anti-ferromagnetic correlations are suppressed, being instead driven by paramagnetic spin fluctuations and unrelated to quantum criticality. Our results precisely characterize the Planckian carriers responsible for both the strange metal resistivities and the unconventional optical conductivities seen in experiments, highlighting striking similarities with the universal relaxation of glasses and dielectrics.

Basov, Andrew J. Millis, David R. Reichman, Abhay N. Pasupathy, Xavier Roy, Michael E. Ziebel
Abstract: In materials with one-dimensional electronic bands, electron-electron interactions can produce intriguing quantum phenomena, including spin-charge separation and charge density waves (CDW). Most of these systems, however, are non-magnetic, motivating a search for anisotropic materials where the coupling of charge and spin may affect emergent quantum states. Here, chemical intercalation of the van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrSBr yields $Li_{0.17(2)} (tetrahydrofuran)_{0.26(3)} CrSBr$, which possess an electronically driven quasi-1D CDW with an onset temperature above room temperature. Concurrently, electron doping increases the magnetic ordering temperature from 132 K to 200 K and switches its interlayer magnetic coupling from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. The spin-polarized nature of the anisotropic bands that give rise to this CDW enforces an intrinsic coupling of charge and spin. The coexistence and interplay of ferromagnetism and charge modulation in this exfoliatable material provides a promising platform for studying tunable quantum phenomena across a range of temperatures and thicknesses.

Title: Quantum Fisher Information Reveals UV-IR Mixing in the Strange Metal
Authors: David Bałut, Xuefei Guo, Niels de Vries, Dipanjan Chaudhuri, Barry Bradlyn, Peter Abbamonte, Philip W. Phillips
Abstract: The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. For a Fermi liquid, we find that the QFI grows quadratically as the temperature increases, consistent then with the phase space available for scattering in the standard theory of metals. By contrast, the QFI in a strange metal increases as a power law at as the temperature decreases, but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.

Title: The Diffusive Nature of Housing Prices
Authors: Antoine-Cyrus Becharat, Michael Benzaquen, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud
Abstract: We analyze the French housing market prices in the period 1970-2022, with high-resolution data from 2018 to 2022. The spatial correlation of the observed price field exhibits logarithmic decay characteristic of the two-dimensional random diffusion equation -- local interactions may create long-range correlations. We introduce a stylized model, used in the past to model spatial regularities in voting patterns, that accounts for both spatial and temporal correlations with reasonable values of parameters. Our analysis reveals that price shocks are persistent in time and their amplitude is strongly heterogeneous in space. Our study confirms and quantifies the diffusive nature of housing prices that was anticipated long ago (Clapp et al. 1994, Pollakowski et al. 1997), albeit on much restricted, local data sets.

Title: Probability distributions of the order parameter of the $O(N)$ model
Authors: Adam Rançon, Bertrand Delamotte, Lovro Šaravanja, Ivan Balog
Abstract: We study the probability distribution function (PDF) of the order parameter of the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model at criticality using the functional renormalisation group. For this purpose, we generalize the method introduced in [Balog et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 129}, 210602 (2022)] to the $O(N)$ model. We study the large $N$ limit, as well as the cases $N=2$ and $N=3$ at the level of the Local Potential Approximation (LPA), and compare our results to Monte Carlo simulations. We compute the entire family of universal scaling functions, obtained in the limit where the system size $L$ and the correlation length of the infinite system $\xi_\infty$ diverge, with the ratio $\zeta=L/\xi_\infty$ constant. We also generalize our results to the approach of criticality from the low-temperature phase where another infinite family of universal PDF exists. We find that the LPA describes very well the functional form of the family of PDFs, once we correct for a global amplitude of the (logarithm of the) PDF and of $\zeta$.

Title: Interactive Multiscale Modeling to Bridge Atomic Properties and Electrochemical Performance in Li-CO$_2$ Battery Design
Authors: Mohammed Lemaalem, Selva Chandrasekaran Selvaraj, Ilias Papailias, Naveen K. Dandu, Arash Namaeighasemi, Larry A. Curtiss, Amin Salehi-Khojin, Anh T. Ngo
Abstract: Li-CO$_2$ batteries show promise as energy storage solutions, offering high theoretical energy density and CO$_2$ fixation. Their operation is based on the formation and decomposition of Li$_2$CO$_3$/C during discharge and charge cycles, respectively. We used a multiscale modeling framework that integrates Density Functional Theory (DFT), Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD), classical Molecular Dynamics (MD), and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to investigate atomic and cell-level properties. The considered Li-CO$_2$ battery consists of a lithium metal anode, an ionic liquid electrolyte, and a carbon cloth porous cathode with Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ as a catalyst. DFT and AIMD determined the electrical conductivities of Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ and Li$_2$CO$_3$ using the Kubo-Greenwood formalism and studied the CO$_2$ reduction mechanism on the cathode catalyst. MD simulations calculated the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient, Li$^+$ transference number, ionic conductivity, and Li$^+$ solvation structure. The FEA model, incorporating results from atomistic simulations, reproduced experimental voltage-capacity profiles at 1 mA/cm$^2$ and revealed spatio-temporal variations in Li$_2$CO$_3$/C deposition, porosity, and CO$_2$ concentration dependence on discharge rates in the cathode. Accordingly, Li$_2$CO$_3$ can form large and thin film deposits, leading to dispersed and local porosity changes at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ and 1 mA/cm$^2$, respectively. The capacity decreases exponentially from 81,570 mAh/g at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ to 6,200 mAh/g at 1 mA/cm$^2$, due to pore clogging from excessive discharge product deposition that limits CO$_2$ transport to the cathode interior. Therefore, the performance of Li-CO$_2$ batteries can be improved by enhancing CO$_2$ transport, regulating Li$_2$CO$_3$ deposition, and optimizing cathode architecture.

Title: Three-Dimensional to Layered Halide Perovskites: A Parameter-Free Hybrid Functional Method for Predicting Electronic Band Gaps
Authors: Ibrahim Buba Garba, Lorenzo Trombini, Claudine Katan, Jacky Even, Marios Zacharias, Mikael Kepenekian, George Volonakis
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic band gaps in halide perovskites using density functional theory is crucial for optoelectronic applications. Standard hybrid functionals like HSE and PBE0 are becoming computationally accessible, yet can fail at predicting the band gaps for three-dimensional (3D) and/or layered halide perovskite. This study evaluates the doubly screened dielectric-dependent hybrid (DSH) functional for predicting band gaps of Pb- and Sn-based inorganic and hybrid 3D halide perovskites, as well as layered hybrid perovskites. The DSH functional employs material-dependent mixing parameters derived from macroscopic dielectric constants, and accurately predicts band gaps for 3D perovskites only if structural local disorder is taken into account. For layered hybrid perovskites, the DSH functional based on average dielectric constants tends to overestimate the band gaps. To improve predictions, we propose using the calculated dielectric constant of the respective 3D perovskites to define the DSH screening. This method is then applied to Pb- and Sn-based layered halide perovskites with various organic spacers and multilayered structures, such as $BA_2MA_{n-1}Pb_{n}I_{3n-1}$ with n =1, 2, 3, resulting in improved precision. The HSE functional systematically underestimates band gaps in layered perovskites due to the missing non-local long-range dielectric screening. On the other hand, the PBE0 is in good agreement with the experimental values, in particular for the layered iodide perovskites. The computational framework introduced here provides an efficient parameter-free \textit{ab initio} methodology suitable for predicting the electronic properties of 3D, layered halide perovskites and their heterostructures, towards modelling materials for advanced optoelectronic devices

Title: Deep learning with reflection high-energy electron diffraction images to predict cation ratio in Sr$_{2x}$Ti$_{2(1-x)}$O$_{3}$ thin films
Authors: Sumner B. Harris, Patrick T. Gemperline, Christopher M. Rouleau, Rama K. Vasudevan, Ryan B. Comes
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) with in situ diagnostics offers a transformative approach to accelerate, understand, and control thin film synthesis by uncovering relationships between synthesis conditions and material properties. In this study, we demonstrate the application of deep learning to predict the stoichiometry of Sr$_{2x}$Ti$_{2(1-x)}$O$_{3}$ thin films using reflection high-energy electron diffraction images acquired during pulsed laser deposition. A gated convolutional neural network trained for regression of the Sr atomic fraction achieved accurate predictions with a small dataset of 31 samples. Explainable AI techniques revealed a previously unknown correlation between diffraction streak features and cation stoichiometry in Sr$_{2x}$Ti$_{2(1-x)}$O$_{3}$ thin films. Our results demonstrate how ML can be used to transform a ubiquitous in situ diagnostic tool, that is usually limited to qualitative assessments, into a quantitative surrogate measurement of continuously valued thin film properties. Such methods are critically needed to enable real-time control, autonomous workflows, and accelerate traditional synthesis approaches.

Title: Tunable altermagnetism via inter-chain engineering in parallelassembled atomic chains
Authors: Deping Guo, Canbo Zong, Weihan Zhang, Cong Wang, Junwei Liu, Wei Ji
Abstract: Altermagnetism has recently drawn considerable attention in three- and twodimensional materials. Here, we extend this concept to quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) monolayers assembled from single-atomic magnetic chains. Through systematically examining nine types of structures, two stacking orders, and intra-/inter-chain magnetic couplings, we identify four out of thirty promising structural prototypes for hosting altermagnetism, which yields 192 potential monolayer materials. We further confirm eight thermodynamically stable Q1D monolayers via high-throughput calculations. Using symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we find that the existence of altermagnetism is determined by the type of inter-chain magnetic coupling and predict three intrinsic altermagnets,\(CrBr_3\),\(VBr_3\),\(MnBr_3\),due to their ferromagnetic inter-chain couplings and five extrinsic ones,\(CrF_3\),\(CrCl_3\),\(CrI_3\),\(FeCl_3\)and \(CoTe_3\), ascribed to their neglectable or antiferromagnetic inter-chain couplings. Moreover, the inter-chain magnetic coupling here is highly tunable by manipulating the inter-chain spacing, leading to experimentally feasible transitions between altermagnetic and nodal-line semiconducting states. In addition, applying external electric fields can further modulate the spin splitting. Our findings establish a highly tunable family of Q1D altermagnets, offering fundamental insights into the intricate relationship between geometry, electronic structure, and this http URL discoveries hold significant promises for experimental realization and future spintronic applications.

Title: Asymmetric simple exclusion process on a random comb: Transport properties in the stationary state
Authors: Mrinal Sarkar, Shamik Gupta
Abstract: We address the dynamics of interacting particles on a disordered lattice formed by a random comb. The dynamics comprises that of the asymmetric simple exclusion process, whereby motion to nearest-neighour sites that are empty is more likely in the direction of a bias than in the opposite direction. The random comb comprises a backbone lattice from each site of which emanates a branch with a random number of sites. The backbone and the branches run in the direction of the bias. The number of branch sites or alternatively the branch lengths are sampled independently from a common distribution, specifically, an exponential distribution. The system relaxes at long times into a nonequilibrium stationary state. We analyse the stationary-state density of sites across the random comb, and also explore the transport properties, in particular, the stationary-state drift velocity of particles along the backbone. We show that in the stationary state, the density is uniform along the backbone and nonuniform along the branches, decreasing monotonically from the free-end of a branch to its intersection with the backbone. On the other hand, the drift velocity as a function of the bias strength has a non-monotonic dependence, first increasing and then decreasing with increase of bias. However, remarkably, as the particle density increases, the dependence becomes no more non-monotonic. We understand this effect as a consequence of an interplay between biased hopping and hard-core exclusion, whereby sites towards the free end of the branches remain occupied for long times and become effectively non-participatory in the dynamics of the system. This results in an effective reduction of the branch lengths and a motion of the particles that takes place primarily along the backbone.

Title: The open driven two-level system at conical intersections of quasienergies
Authors: Sigmund Kohler
Abstract: We study the stationary state of an ac-driven two-level system under particle exchange with a fermionic environment. A particular question addressed is whether there exist limits in which the populations of the Floquet states are determined by their quasienergies or their mean energies, respectively. The focus lies on parameters in the vicinity of conical intersections of quasienergies, because there the two kinds of energies behave rather differently, such that the characteristics of the two intuitive limits are most pronounced. A main finding is a crossover from a Floquet-Gibbs-like state at low temperatures to a mean-energy dominated state at intermediate temperatures. Analytical estimates are confirmed by numerical calculations.

Title: Angular Dependence of Specific Heat and Magnetization Effects in the Kitaev Model
Authors: Takao Morinari, Hibiki Takegami
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a magnetic field on the Kitaev model using the equation of motion approach for the spin Green's function. Our study considers both cases: suppressed magnetization and finite magnetization in the paramagnetic phase of the Kitaev model. When magnetization is suppressed, the specific heat exhibits a $60^\circ$ periodicity in its angular dependence, with maxima and minima aligning with recent experimental observations in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Furthermore, a qualitative difference emerges in the temperature dependence of the maxima and minima: the maxima exhibit behavior characteristic of a gapless feature, while the minima suggest a gapful feature. This behavior can be interpreted as a signature of Majorana fermion gap formation. When magnetization is included, the angular dependence of the specific heat remains similar; however, both the maxima and minima show similar temperature dependence, suggesting that the Majorana fermion gap behavior is smeared out by the presence of magnetization. Our results indicate that the suppression of magnetization is essential for observing features associated with Majorana fermions, suggesting that a nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction could contribute to this suppression.

Title: Revealing Nanostructures in High-Entropy Alloys via Machine-Learning Accelerated Scalable Monte Carlo Simulation
Authors: Xianglin Liu, Kai Yang, Yongxiang Liu, Fanli Zhou, Dengdong Fan, Zongrui Pei, Pengxiang Xu, Yonghong Tian
Abstract: The computational cost of traditional first-principles method quickly becomes prohibitively expensive as the number of atoms increases. This challenge is further amplified by the need to evaluate finite-temperature properties with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which is inherently challenging to parallelize due to sequential Markov chain updates. Here, we introduce Scalable Monte Carlo (SMC), an efficient MC simulation method that overcomes the parallelization bottlenecks in conventional MC simulation, reducing the computational complexity of a MC sweep from quadratic to linear. We present a GPU implementation of the SMC method, SMC-GPU, which simultaneously harnesses the thousands of processing cores on a GPU to accelerate the computation. By adopting a data-driven workflow that surrogates the computationally expensive density functional theory (DFT) with ML models, we demonstrate that SMC-GPU is capable of simulating systems of more than one-billion atoms, while maintaining the accuracy of first-principles methods. Using this unprecedented capability, we performed billion-atom MC simulations to investigate the nanostructure evolution of two important high-entropy alloys (HEAs), FeCoNiAlTi and MoNbTaW, in which the nanostructures are believed to be responsible for their superb mechanical properties. Our results reveal a rich diversity of nanostructures, including nanoparticles (NP), 3D-connected NP, and disorder protected nanophases. We quantitatively analyze the size, composition, and morphology of the nanostructures, as well as directly simulate the atom-probe-tomography (APT) needle. The results align well with available experimental observations. This work underscores the promising potential of leveraging large-scale MC simulation to explore the largely uncharted territory of nanostructure evolution in HEAs.

Title: Data-driven Azimuthal RHEED construction for in-situ crystal growth characterization
Authors: Abdourahman Khaireh-Walieh, Alexandre Arnoult, Sébastien Plissard, Peter R. Wiecha
Abstract: Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) is a powerful tool to probe the surface reconstruction during MBE growth. However, raw RHEED patterns are difficult to interpret, especially when the wafer is rotating. A more accessible representation of the information is therefore the so-called Azimuthal RHEED (ARHEED), an angularly resolved plot of the electron diffraction pattern during a full wafer rotation. However, ARHEED requires precise information about the rotation angle as well as of the position of the specular spot of the electron beam. We present a Deep Learning technique to automatically construct the Azimuthal RHEED from bare RHEED images, requiring no further measurement equipment. We use two artificial neural networks: an image segmentation model to track the center of the specular spot and a regression model to determine the orientation of the crystal with respect to the incident electron beam of the RHEED system. Our technique enables accurate and real-time ARHEED construction on any growth chamber equipped with a RHEED system.

Title: Anatomy of torques from orbital Rashba textures: the case of Co/Al interfaces
Authors: A. Pezo, N. Sebe, A. Manchon, V. Cros, H. Jaffrès
Abstract: In the context of orbitronics, the rising of the orbital angular momentum generated at light metal interfaces from orbital textures via orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects nowadays represent extraordinary alternatives to the usual heavy-metal spin-based materials. In the light of very recent experimental results [\textcolor{blue}{S. Krishnia \textit{et al.}, Nanoletters 2023, 23, 6785}], starting from state-of-the-art density functional theory simulations, we provide theoretical insights into the emergence of very strong orbital torques at the Co/Al interface location a strong orbital Rashba texture. By using linear response theory, we calculate the exerted orbital torque amplitudes, mainly of field-like intraband character, acting onto the ultrathin Co. Moreover, we show that an insertion of a single atomic plane of Pt between Co and Al is enough to suppress the effect which questions about the anatomy of the torque action clearly behaving differently than in the standard way. This work opens new routes to the engineering of spintronic devices.

Title: Review of the Electrochemical Double Layer Theory and Its Applications in Battery Electrode Materials
Authors: Yitao He
Abstract: The interface plays a critical role in electrochemical systems, driving the development of various theories to investigate properties at nanoscale and microscale levels, including the electrictrochemical double layer (EDL) theory and continuum theory. However, the application of EDL theory within the realm of battery electrode materials has not been clearly defined according to material type. The diverse range of materials and their intricate interactions with interface theories often lead to misunderstandings. This review meticulously outlines the origins and principles of the EDL theory. Additionally, it categorizes battery electrode materials into two main groups: semiconductors and conductors. A comprehensive examination is presented on the implementation of EDL and other interface theories, accompanied by a comparative evaluation of the fundamental models and experiments described.

Title: A brief note on the G$_2$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki chain
Authors: Hosho Katsura, Dirk Schuricht
Abstract: We consider the valence bond solid (VBS) state built of singlet pairs of fundamental representations and projected onto adjoint representations of the exceptional Lie group G$_2$. The two-point correlation function in the VBS state is non-vanishing only for nearest neighbours, but possesses finite string order. We construct a parent Hamiltonian for the VBS state, which constitutes the G$_2$ analog of the famous AKLT chain.

Title: Small-Mass Asymptotics of Massive Point Vortex Dynamics in Bose--Einstein Condensates
Authors: Tomoki Ohsawa, Andrea Richaud
Abstract: We perform an asymptotic analysis of the massive point vortex dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensates in the small-mass limit $\varepsilon \to 0$. We show that the orthogonal projection of the massive dynamics to a certain subspace $\mathcal{K}$ (called kinematic subspace) in the phase space yields the standard massless vortex dynamics or the Kirchhoff equations. We show that the massless dynamics is the zeroth-order approximation to the massive equation as $\varepsilon \to 0$, and also derive a first-order correction to the zeroth-order massless dynamics. The massive dynamics near $\mathcal{K}$ is well approximated by the corresponding massless dynamics. In fact, our main result proves that the massive dynamics starting in $\mathcal{K}$ stays $O(\varepsilon)$-close to $\mathcal{K}$ for short time. On the other hand, the massive dynamics starting outside $\mathcal{K}$ exhibits an oscillatory initial layer due to its inertia and deviates significantly from the massless dynamics. We also perform an asymptotic analysis with a rescaled time to derive the inner approximation to capture the initial layer. The 0th-order inner equations are exactly solvable, and the 1st-order inner equations can be solved by quadrature. The combined inner approximation captures the initial oscillatory layer of the massive dynamics.

Title: Floquet control of topological phases and Hall effects in Z2 nodal line semimetals
Authors: Pu Liu, Chaoxi Cui, Lei Li, Runze Li, Dong-Hui Xu, Zhi-Ming Yu
Abstract: Dynamic control of topological properties in materials is central to modern condensed matter physics, and Floquet engineering, utilizing periodic light fields, provides a promising avenue. Here, we use Floquet theory to theoretically study the topological response of a Z2 nodal line semimetal (NLSM) when driven by circularly polarized light (CPL). We demonstrate that the direction of CPL irradiation critically dictates the resulting topological phase transitions. Specifically, when light is incident perpendicular to the nodal line plane, increasing the light amplitude induces two successive topological phase transitions: first, from the Z2 NLSM to a vortex NLSM, a rare and intriguing topological state; and second, a transition from the vortex NLSM to a semimetal with a pair of Weyl points (WPs). In stark contrast, irradiation along other directions directly transforms the Z2 nodal line into a pair of WPs. We further investigate the transport properties of the Floquet Z2 NLSM, focusing on the anomalous and planar Hall effects. The anomalous Hall effect exhibits a direction-dependent amplitude variation, deviating from conventional two-band NLSM behavior. Importantly, we reveal a significant and tunable planar Hall effect, a phenomenon largely unexplored in Floquet topological materials, which is highly sensitive to both light amplitude and direction. Our findings not only present a novel route to realize the vortex NLSM, but also establish an efficient way to control Hall transport phenomena in Z2 NLSMs.

Title: Mixed radix numeration bases: Horner's rule, Yang-Baxter equation and Furstenberg's conjecture
Authors: Damien Simon
Abstract: Mixed radix bases in numeration is a very old notion but it is rarely studied on its own or in relation with concrete problems related to number theory. Starting from the natural question of the conversion of a basis to another for integers as well as polynomials, we use mixed radix bases to introduce two-dimensional arrays with suitable filling rules. These arrays provide algorithms of conversion which uses only a finite number of euclidean division to convert from one basis to another; it is interesting to note that these algorithms are generalizations of the well-known Horner's rule of quick evaluation of polynomials. The two-dimensional arrays with local transformations are reminiscent from statistical mechanics models: we show that changes between three numeration basis are related to the set-theoretical Yang-Baxter equation and this is, up to our knowledge, the first time that such a structure is described in number theory. As an illustration, we reinterpret well-known results around Furstenberg's conjecture in terms of Yang-Baxter transformations between mixed radix bases, hence opening the way to alternative approaches.

Title: Loop Series Expansions for Tensor Networks
Authors: Glen Evenbly, Nicola Pancotti, Ashley Milsted, Johnnie Gray, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) can be a useful tool to approximately contract a tensor network, provided that the contributions from any closed loops in the network are sufficiently weak. In this manuscript we describe how a loop series expansion can be applied to systematically improve the accuracy of a BP approximation to a tensor network contraction, in principle converging arbitrarily close to the exact result. More generally, our result provides a framework for expanding a tensor network as a sum of component networks in a hierarchy of increasing complexity. We benchmark this proposal for the contraction of iPEPS, either representing the ground state of an AKLT model or with randomly defined tensors, where it is shown to improve in accuracy over standard BP by several orders of magnitude whilst incurring only a minor increase in computational cost. These results indicate that the proposed series expansions could be a useful tool to accurately evaluate tensor networks in cases that otherwise exceed the limits of established contraction routines.

Title: Thermal Bootstrap of Matrix Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Minjae Cho, Barak Gabai, Joshua Sandor, Xi Yin
Abstract: We implement a bootstrap method that combines stationary state conditions, thermal inequalities, and semidefinite relaxations of matrix logarithm in the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, at finite rank N as well as in the large N limit, and determine finite temperature observables that interpolate between available analytic results in the low and high temperature limits respectively. We also obtain bootstrap bounds on thermal phase transition as well as preliminary results in the ungauged two-matrix quantum mechanics.

Title: Everything everywhere all at once: a probability-based enhanced sampling approach to rare events
Authors: Enrico Trizio, Peilin Kang, Michele Parrinello
Abstract: The problem of studying rare events is central to many areas of computer simulations. In a recent paper [Kang, P., et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460, 2024], we have shown that a powerful way of solving this problem passes through the computation of the committor function, and we have demonstrated how the committor can be iteratively computed in a variational way and the transition state ensemble efficiently sampled. Here, we greatly ameliorate this procedure by combining it with a metadynamics-like enhanced sampling approach in which a logarithmic function of the committor is used as a collective variable. This integrated procedure leads to an accurate and balanced sampling of the free energy surface in which transition states and metastable basins are studied with the same thoroughness. We also show that our approach can be used in cases in which competing reactive paths are possible and intermediate metastable are encountered. In addition, we demonstrate how physical insights can be obtained from the optimized committor model and the sampled data, thus providing a full characterization of the rare event under study. We ascribe the success of this approach to the use of a probability-based description of rare events.

Title: Average-case matrix discrepancy: satisfiability bounds
Authors: Antoine Maillard
Abstract: Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta > 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_{\rm op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau > 0$. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau < \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau > \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions is exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau>\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the semicircle law. Finally, under a technical assumption, we show that there exists values of $(\tau,\kappa)$ for which the number of solutions has large variance, implying the failure of the second moment method. Our proofs rely on establishing concentration and large deviation properties of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints.

Title: Geometry effect of the dynamical quantum phase transitions at finite temperatures
Authors: Jia-Chen Tang, Xu-Yang Hou, Hao Guo
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) probe the nonequilibrium evolution of quantum systems, unveiling their geometric and topological characteristics. In this study, we introduce the concepts of parallel quench and dynamic geometrical order parameter (DGOP) for non-band models, where these quantities capture the geometric shifts associated with DQPTs. At zero temperature, the DGOP corresponds to the Pancharatnam geometric phase, while at finite temperatures, it extends to the interferometric geometric phase. We further generalize the dynamic topological order parameter (DTOP) to finite-temperature band models, examining its behavior in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Our analysis shows that thermal fluctuations and boundary effects at finite temperatures disrupt the quantization of the DTOP, yet it retains signatures of topological transitions. These findings deepen the understanding of geometric and topological properties in quantum dynamics, illuminating DQPTs across both non-band and band frameworks.

Title: On learning higher-order cumulants in diffusion models
Authors: Gert Aarts, Diaa E. Habibi, Lingxiao Wang, Kai Zhou
Abstract: To analyse how diffusion models learn correlations beyond Gaussian ones, we study the behaviour of higher-order cumulants, or connected n-point functions, under both the forward and backward process. We derive explicit expressions for the moment- and cumulant-generating functionals, in terms of the distribution of the initial data and properties of forward process. It is shown analytically that during the forward process higher-order cumulants are conserved in models without a drift, such as the variance-expanding scheme, and that therefore the endpoint of the forward process maintains nontrivial correlations. We demonstrate that since these correlations are encoded in the score function, higher-order cumulants are learnt in the backward process, also when starting from a normal prior. We confirm our analytical results in an exactly solvable toy model with nonzero cumulants and in scalar lattice field theory.

Title: Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves
Authors: Or Dobkowski, Barak Trok, Peter Skakunenko, Yonathan Japha, David Groswasser, Maxim Efremov, Chiara Marletto, Ivette Fuentes, Roger Penrose, Vlatko Vedral, Wolfgang P. Schleich, Ron Folman
Abstract: Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely-falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. To measure this gauge phase we realise a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.

Title: Experimental Signatures for Identifying Distinct Origins of Color Field Generation
Authors: Subramanya Bhat K. N., Amita Das, Bhooshan Paradkar, V Ravishankar
Abstract: Signatures for non-abelian dynamics have long been central to QCD and QGP. Equally important are they in spin systems and laser-plasma interactions, where they emerge as effective interactions. Distinguishing experimentally gauge inequivalent sources (and hence potentials) that produce the same field tensor is one major task in this endeavour. As a step in this direction, this paper investigates how physically distinct sources which produce the same color electric field (uniform and constant) may be distinguished experimentally in a gauge-invariant manner. We first study the motion of a test particle in such fields and show that the resultant trajectories are counterintuitive. We then examine the radiation emitted - both gluonic and photonic and show that each source (independent non-abelian configuration) leaves a unique signature in the energy spectra, laying the ground for application to specific physical systems.
