Title: Accelerating magnonic simulations with the pseudospectral Landau-Lifshitz equation
Authors: A. Roxburgh, M. Copus, E. Iacocca
Abstract: The pseudospectral Landau-Lifshitz (PS-LL) model can describe atomic-scale magnetic exchange interactions within a continuum framework. This is achieved by employing a convolution kernel that models the nonlocal interaction in a grid-independent manner. Even though the PS-LL was originally introduced to address atomic exchange, any nonlocal kernel can be modeled. In the field of magnonics, the dipole field is fundamental to describe the dispersion relation of magnons, the quasiparticle representation of angular momentum. Because dipole-dipole interactions are long-range, numerical approaches typically rely on convolutions. Here, we demonstrate that the PS-LL model can be used to perform magnonic simulations with a single convolution kernel derived from analytical solutions. We demonstrate a twofold increase in computational speed compared with the full dipole calculation. This approach is valid insofar as the excitations are linear, which is typically the case for magnons. Our results have the potential to accelerate magnonic research, particularly for the inverse design method, where several simulations must be performed to achieve the desired outcome.

Title: Cyclotron reonance in a kagome spin liquid candidate material
Authors: Byungmin Kang, Patrick A. Lee
Abstract: We propose cyclotron resonance as an optical probe for emergent fractionalized excitations in $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum spin liquids, focusing on kagome antiferromagnets. In contrast to conventional systems, where cyclotron resonance directly couples to charged carriers, spinons in spin liquids are charge-neutral and interact only through an emergent gauge field. We identify two key mechanisms by which an external physical electromagnetic field induces emergent electric and magnetic fields, enabling indirect coupling to spinons. Using these mechanisms, we compute the absorption rate of the cyclotron resonance response for Dirac spinons forming Landau levels. Our analysis shows that, although the absorption per layer is small, the absence of a skin-depth limitation in insulating spin liquids allows for cumulative absorption comparable to graphene in realistic sample sizes for the recently discovered spin-liquid candidate material YCu${}_3$(OH)${}_6$Br${}_2$[Br${}_{1-y}$(OH)${}_y$]. Our findings shows that cyclotron resonance is a viable experimental probe of spinon Landau quantization and emergent gauge fields, providing powerful positive experimental signatures of quantum spin liquids.

Title: Chern-Simons-matter conformal field theory on fuzzy sphere: Confinement transition of Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid
Authors: Zheng Zhou, Chong Wang, Yin-Chen He
Abstract: Gauge theories compose a large class of interacting conformal field theories in 3d, among which an outstanding category is critical Chern-Simons-matter theories. In this paper, we focus on one of the simplest instances: one complex critical scalar coupled to $\mathrm{U}(1)_2$ Chern-Simons gauge field. It is theoretically interesting as it is conjectured to exhibit dualities between four simple Lagrangian descriptions, but also practically important as it describes the transition between Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (or $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state) and trivially gapped phase. Using the fuzzy sphere regularisation, we realise this theory as a transition on the spherical lowest Landau level between a $\nu_f=2$ fermionic integer quantum Hall state and a $\nu_b=1/2$ bosonic fractional quantum Hall state. We show that this transition is continuous and has emergent conformal symmetry. By studying the operator spectrum, we show that there exists only one relevant singlet with scaling dimension $\Delta_S=1.52(18)$. We also discuss other higher operators and the consequences of our results.

Title: Local Potential Functional Embedding Theory of Molecular Systems: Localized Orbital-Based Embedding from an Exact Density-Functional Perspective
Authors: W. Makhlouf, B. Senjean, E. Fromager
Abstract: Localized orbital-based quantum embedding, as originally formulated in the context of density matrix embedding theory (DMET), is revisited from the perspective of lattice density functional theory (DFT). An in-principle exact (in the sense of full configuration interaction) formulation of the theory, where the occupations of the localized orbitals play the role of the density, is derived for any (model or ab initio) electronic Hamiltonian. From this general formalism we deduce an exact relation between the local Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential of the full-size Kohn-Sham (KS) lattice-like system and the embedding chemical potential that is adjusted on each embedded fragment, individually, such that both KS and embedding cluster systems reproduce the exact same local density. When well-identified density-functional approximations (that find their justification in the strongly correlated regime) are applied, a practical self-consistent local potential functional embedding theory (LPFET), where the local Hxc potential becomes the basic variable, naturally emerges from the theory. LPFET differs from previous density embedding approaches by its fragment-dependent embedding chemical potential expression, which is a simple functional of the Hxc potential. Numerical calculations on prototypical systems show the ability of such an ansatz to ease convergence and improve substantially the description of density profiles (localized orbital occupations in this context) in strongly correlated systems.

Title: Van der Waals injection-molded crystals
Authors: Vinh Tran, Amy X. Wu, Laisi Chen, Ziyu Feng, Vijay Kumar, Takashi Taniguichi, Kenji Watanabe, Javier Sanchez-Yamagishi
Abstract: Shaping low-dimensional crystals into precise geometries with low disorder is an outstanding challenge. Here, we present a method to grow single crystals of arbitrary geometry within van der Waals (vdW) materials. By injecting molten material between atomically-flat vdW layers within an SiO2 mold, we produce ultraflat and thin crystals of bismuth, tin, and indium that are shaped as hallbars, rings, and nanowires. The crystals are grown fully encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride, a vdW material, providing protection from oxidation. Varying the depth of the mold allows us to control the crystal thickness from ten to a hundred nanometers. Structural measurements demonstrate large single-crystals encompassing the entire mold geometry, while transport measurements show reduced disorder scattering. This approach offers a means to produce complex single-crystal nanostructures without the disorder introduced by post-growth nanofabrication.

Title: Learning disentangled latent representations facilitates discovery and design of functional materials
Authors: Jaehoon Cha, Tingyao Lu, Matthew Walker, Keith T. Butler
Abstract: The discovery of new materials is often constrained by the need for large labelled datasets or expensive simulations. In this study, we explore the use of Disentangling Autoencoders (DAEs) to learn compact and interpretable representations of spectral data in an entirely unsupervised manner. We demonstrate that the DAE captures physically meaningful features in optical absorption spectra, relevant to photovoltaic (PV) performance, including a latent dimension strongly correlated with the Spectroscopic Limited Maximum Efficiency (SLME)--despite being trained without access to SLME labels. This feature corresponds to a well-known spectral signature: the transition from direct to indirect optical band gaps. Compared to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a beta-Variational Autoencoder (beta-VAE), the DAE achieves superior reconstruction fidelity, improved correlation with efficiency metrics, and more compact encoding of relevant features. We further show that the DAE latent space enables more efficient discovery of high-performing PV materials, identifying top candidates using fewer evaluations than both VAE-guided and random search. These results highlight the potential of DAEs as a powerful tool for unsupervised structure-property learning and suggest broad applicability to other areas of materials discovery where labeled data is limited but rich structure is present in raw signals.

Title: Exciton dynamics and exciton-phonon coupling in bulk and thin flakes of layered van der Waals antiferromagnet Ni2P2S6
Authors: Nasaru Khan, Yuliia Shemerliuk, Sebastian Selter, Bernd Büchner, Saicharan Aswartham, Pradeep Kumar
Abstract: The Zhang-Rice (ZR) singlet is an intriguing quantum state offering potential to realize a spin-orbit-entangled bosonic quasiparticle, which gives rise to the Zhang-Rice exciton. Its formation is attributed to the correlation between a localized d-orbital of a transition metal and the p-orbitals of the neighbouring ligands. The layered two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic Ni2P2S6 system provide an excellent platform to probe the ZR exciton dynamics along with the role of exciton-phonon coupling. Here, we present a comprehensive study of ZR exciton and coupling with the phonons in bulk and few-layered single crystals of Ni2P2S6 using temperature, polarization and power-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. At cryogenic temperatures, the PL spectra reveal distinct phonon sidebands spaced by an energy difference of nearly 117 cm-1, indicative of exciton-phonon hybridization. Polarization-resolved measurements demonstrate a strong optical anisotropy, with a linear polarization degree of ~ 40 % at 4 K. Excitation power variation highlights linear scaling of PL intensity in the low-power regime, followed by spectral deformation at higher powers attributed to the phonon-assisted recombination and exciton saturation effects. ZR exciton and phonon side bands survival temperature decreases with decreasing flake thickness suggesting their tunability. The emergence and suppression of phonon sidebands with temperature and flake thickness emphasize dimensional sensitivity and coherence limits of excitonic states. Our findings position Ni2P2S6 as a promising candidate for tunable and anisotropic optoelectronic applications, while offering insight into quasiparticle interactions in 2D magnetic systems.

Title: Data-efficient machine-learning of complex Fe-Mo intermetallics using domain knowledge of chemistry and crystallography
Authors: Mariano Forti, Alesya Malakhova, Yury Lysogorskiy, Wenhao Zhang, Jean-Claude Crivello, Jean-Marc Joubert, Ralf Drautz, Thomas Hammerschmidt
Abstract: Atomistic simulations of multi-component systems require accurate descriptions of interatomic interactions to resolve details in the energy of competing phases. A particularly challenging case are topologically close-packed (TCP) phases with close energetic competition of numerous different site occupations even in binary systems like Fe-Mo. In this work, machine learning (ML) models are presented that overcome this challenge by using features with domain knowledge of chemistry and crystallography. The resulting data-efficient ML models need only a small set of training data of simple TCP phases $A$15, $\sigma$, $\chi$, $\mu$, $C$14, $C$15, $C$36 with 2-5 WS to reach robust and accurate predictions for the complex TCP phases $R$, $M$, $P$, $\delta$ with 11-14 WS. Several ML models with kernel-ridge regression, multi-layer perceptrons, and random forests, are trained on less than 300 DFT calculations for the simple TCP phases in Fe-Mo. The performance of these ML models is shown to improve systematically with increased utilization of domain knowledge. The convex hulls of the $R$, $M$, $P$ and $\delta$ phase in the Fe-Mo system are predicted with uncertainties of 20-25 meV/atom and show very good agreement with DFT verification. Complementary X-ray diffraction experiments and Rietveld analysis are carried out for an Fe-Mo R-phase sample. The measured WS occupancy is in excellent agreement with the predictions of our ML model using the Bragg Williams approximation at the same temperature.

Title: Dynamics of current-induced switching in the quantum anomalous Hall effect
Authors: Alina Rupp, Daniel Rosenbach, Torsten Röper, Dominik Hoborka, Alexey A. Taskin, Yoichi Ando, Erwann Bocquillon
Abstract: Ferromagnetic topological insulators in the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) regime host chiral, dissipationless edge states whose propagation direction is determined by the internal magnetization. Under suitable conditions, a strong electrical bias can induce magnetization reversal, and thus flip the propagation direction. In this work, we perform time-resolved measurements to investigate the switching dynamics. Our results reveal characteristics consistent with a disordered magnetic landscape and demonstrate that the reversal process is thermally activated, driven by Joule heating during the current pulse. The understanding of the magnetization dynamics in QAH systems opens pathways for local, controlled manipulation of chiral edge states via thermal effects.

Sewell, Iurii Timrov, Aliaksandr V. Yakutovich, Jusong Yu, Nicola Marzari, Carlo A. Pignedoli, Giovanni Pizzi
Abstract: Despite the wide availability of density functional theory (DFT) codes, their adoption by the broader materials science community remains limited due to challenges such as software installation, input preparation, high-performance computing setup, and output analysis. To overcome these barriers, we introduce the Quantum ESPRESSO app, an intuitive, web-based platform built on AiiDAlab that integrates user-friendly graphical interfaces with automated DFT workflows. The app employs a modular Input-Process-Output model and a plugin-based architecture, providing predefined computational protocols, automated error handling, and interactive results visualization. We demonstrate the app's capabilities through plugins for electronic band structures, projected density of states, phonon, infrared/Raman, X-ray and muon spectroscopies, Hubbard parameters (DFT+$U$+$V$), Wannier functions, and post-processing tools. By extending the FAIR principles to simulations, workflows, and analyses, the app enhances the accessibility and reproducibility of advanced DFT calculations and provides a general template to interface with other first-principles calculation codes.

Title: Bonding and the dynamics of glassy network liquids
Authors: M. H. Brown, P. G. Wolynes
Abstract: The Random First Order Transition (RFOT) theory of glasses provides a unified framework for explaining the observed correlations of the kinetic and thermodynamic behaviors of glass-forming liquids having a wide variety of chemical compositions and interactions. The theory also provides a solid starting point for calculating glassy dynamics starting from the microscopic forces. Network liquids, which interact via long-lived, geometrically constraining interactions, such as covalent bonding, have competing energy scales for bond breaking events and for collective particle rearrange- ment events. In this paper, we show microscopic calculations via the RFOT theory can predict how glassy dynamics depends on the degree of bonding, focusing on mixtures of network-forming particles with non-bonding impurities as in familiar window glass. By introducing soft-core nonbonding interactions, we show the viscosity and fragility of the network liquid model can be computed as a function of composition, temperature, and density or pressure. We find that the fragility in the strong-bond limit depends only on composition and not on the bond breaking energy and describes well corresponding measurements in sodium or potassium silicates. The model predicts that materials with weaker bonds may show a non-monotonic trend in the fragility as a function of composition.

Title: Current-induced Magnetoexcitons in Mesoscopic Electron-hole Plasma
Authors: Yu. A. Pusep, M. A. T. Patricio, G. M. Jacobsen, M. D. Teodoro, G. M. Gusev, A. K. Bakarov
Abstract: A radical restructuring of the optical response of highly excited electron-hole plasma formed in a mesoscopic GaAs/AlGaAs channel in a quantizing magnetic field when an electric current flows in the channel has been discovered. In the absence of current, the emission spectra are caused by transitions between Landau levels formed in the conduction band and in the valence band of heavy holes. A critical electric current leads to a drastic change in the emission spectra with a predominant contribution from light holes. It is shown that the current causes local accumulation of light holes due to Coulomb drag, which leads to strong electron-hole coupling and, as a consequence, the formation of excitons and trions.

Title: Towards Environmentally Responsive Hypersound Materials

Abstract: The engineering of acoustic phonons in the gigahertz (GHz) range holds significant potential for technological breakthroughs in areas such as data processing, sensing and quantum communication. Novel approaches for nanophononic resonators responsive to external stimuli provide additional control and functionality for these devices. Mesoporous thin films (MTFs) for example, featuring nanoscale ordered pores, support GHz-range acoustic resonances. These materials are sensitive to environmental changes, such as liquid and vapor infiltration, modifying their effective optical and elastic properties. Here, a SiO$_{2}$ MTF-based open-cavity nanoacoustic resonator is presented, in which the MTF forms the topmost layer and is exposed to the environment. Using a transient reflectivity setup, acoustic responses under varying humidity conditions are investigated. A pronounced shift in acoustic resonance frequency with changes in relative humidity is observed for the first time, demonstrating a simple way to tune hypersound confinement. In addition, resonators with varying pore sizes and thicknesses are compared, revealing that resonance frequencies are primarily influenced by material properties and film thickness, rather than pore size. The proposed open-cavity resonator design provides a versatile platform for future studies on the mechanical response of MTFs to liquid and vapor infiltration, opening the gate to environment-responsive hypersound devices.

Title: Electron-phonon coupled Langevin dynamics for Mott insulators
Authors: Rico Pohle, Yukitoshi Motome, Terumasa Tadano, Shintaro Hoshino
Abstract: The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equations are widely used to study spin dynamics in Mott insulators. However, because energy dissipation is typically introduced phenomenologically, its validity for describing nonequilibrium processes and long-time dynamics in real materials remains questionable. In this paper, we derive a generalized stochastic LLG equation from first principles for spin-orbital coupled Mott insulators, explicitly incorporating the coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and lattice vibrations. Our approach is based on the path-integral formalism formulated along the Keldysh contour, which naturally accounts for dissipation and thermal fluctuations through interactions with a phonon bath and emergent stochastic noise. We benchmark our theoretical framework by numerically integrating the equations of motion for a two-orbital spin chain coupled to Einstein phonons. The resulting energy relaxation mimics realistic cooling dynamics, exhibits nontrivial transient behavior during thermalization, and accurately reproduces thermodynamic properties upon equilibration. This demonstrates the robustness and reliability of our formalism for capturing both equilibrium and nonequilibrium aspects of dissipative spin dynamics in strongly correlated systems. We further show how electron-phonon coupling induces hybridization between electronic and phononic modes in the excitation spectrum. Finally, we demonstrate how the conventional LLG equations can be recovered as a limiting case of our microscopic theory, and discuss their applicability to real materials.

Title: Prediction of Ambient-Pressure High-Temperature Superconductivity in Doped Transition-Metal Hydrides
Authors: Haowei Xu, Olivia Schneble, Rafael Jaramillo, Marek Polański, Ju Li
Abstract: The search for conventional superconductors with high transition temperatures ($T_c$) has largely focused on intrinsically metallic compounds. In this work, we explore the potential of intrinsically non-metallic compounds to exhibit high-$T_c$ superconductivity under ambient pressure through carrier doping. We identify $\rm MgAlFeH_6$, a representative of carrier-doped transition-metal hydrides like $\rm Mg_2FeH_6$, as a promising example with a predicted $T_c \approx 130~\rm K$. We propose that the average projected electron density of states, defined as the geometric mean of the total and hydrogen-projected density of states at the Fermi level, serves as a simple and computationally inexpensive indicator of high-$T_c$ behavior. We also highlight the tradeoff between high-$T_c$ and dynamic stability, both of which depend on the electron density of states. Our findings thus expand the pool of potential superconducting materials and offer a practical route for accelerating the discovery of superconductors suitable for real-world applications.

Title: Magnetic ground state, critical analysis of magnetization, and large magnetocaloric effect in the ferromagnetically coupled kagome lattice YCa$_3$(MnO)$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$
Authors: A. Choudhary, A. Magar, S. Ghosh, S. Kanungo, R. Nath
Abstract: We report a detailed study of the magnetic properties, critical analysis of magnetization, and magnetocaloric effect of a spin-$2$ kagome lattice YCa$_3$(MnO)$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$. The experiments are complemented by the density functional band structure calculations. The magnetic measurements suggest a highly frustrated nature of the compound due to competing ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions with the dominant one being ferromagnetic. It undergoes a unconventional ferromagnetic ordering at $T^* \simeq 7.8$ K and a field induced metamagnetic transition in low fields, implying spin canting. A $H$-$T$ phase diagram is constructed that features three phase regimes. Indeed, the band structure calculations reveal dominant ferromagnetic interaction along the chains that are coupled antiferromagnetically yielding a frustrated kagome geometry. This compound shows a large magnetocaloric effect with isothermal entropy change $\Delta S_{\rm m} \simeq 12$ J/kg-K, adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_{\rm ad} \simeq 8.4$ K, and relative cooling power $RCP \simeq 349$ J/kg for a field change of 7 T. The critical analysis of magnetization and magnetocaloric parameters suggests that the transition is a second order phase transition and it is tricritical mean field type. Owing to it's large magnetocaloric parameters, second order phase transition, and no thermal hysteresis, YCa$_3$(MnO)$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$ emerges as a potential rare-earth free material for magnetic refrigeration.

Title: Theoretical study of the electronic correlation and superconducting pairing in La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ film grown on SrLaAlO$_4$
Authors: Yi Gao
Abstract: We investigate the electronic correlation effects in La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ film grown on SrLaAlO$_4$ by fluctuation-exchange approximation. The $\gamma$ and $\delta$ bands are found to shift down with correlation while their Fermi surfaces become highly damped and cannot to be resolved experimentally. In contrast, the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Fermi surfaces do not vary much with correlation and they are sharp enough to be detected in experiments. The spin susceptibility peaks at a wave vector in the odd channel, connecting the symmetric $\gamma$ band and the asymmetric $\delta$ band. The superconducting pairing symmetry is robustly $s$-wave and the $\delta$ band has the largest pairing magnitude. All the findings suggest a dominant role of the $3d_{z^{2}}$ orbital in this material.

Title: Band-selective Plasmonic Polaron in Thermoelectric Semimetal Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$ with ultra-high power factor
Authors: Daiki Ootsuki, Akitoshi Nakano, Urara Maruoka, Takumi Hasegawa, Masashi Arita, Miho Kitamura, Koji Horiba, Teppei Yoshida, Ichiro Terasaki
Abstract: We report the electronic structure of the thermoelectric semimetal Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$ with a large thermoelectric power factor and giant Peltier conductivity by means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The ARPES spectra reveal the coexistence of a sharp hole band with a light electron mass and a broad electron band with a relatively heavy electron mass, which originate from different quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) chains in Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$. Moreover, the electron band around the Brillouin-zone (BZ) boundary shows a replica structure with respect to the energy originating from plasmonic polarons due to electron-plasmon interactions. The different scattering effects and interactions in each atomic chain lead to asymmetric transport lifetimes of carriers: a large Seebeck coefficient can be realized even in a semimetal. Our findings pave the way for exploring the thermoelectric materials in previously overlooked semimetals and provide a new platform for low-temperature thermoelectric physics, which has been challenging with semiconductors.

Title: Multiscale analysis and lifetime prediction of adhesive lap joints in contact with aggressive environments
Authors: M.P. Ariza, M. Ortiz
Abstract: We formulate a multiscale model of adhesive layers undergoing impurity-dependent cohesive fracture. The model contemplates three scales: i) at the atomic scale, fracture is controlled by interatomic separation and the thermodynamics of separation depends on temperature and impurity concentration; ii) the mesoscale is characterized by the collective response of a large number of interatomic planes across the adhesive layer, resulting in a thickness-dependence strength; in addition, impurities are uptaken from the environment and diffuse through the adhesive layer; and iii) at the macroscale, we focus on lap joints under the action of static loads and aggressive environments. Within this scenario, we obtain closed form analytical solutions for: the dependence of the adhesive layer strength on thickness; the length of the edge cracks, if any, as a function of time; the lifetime of the joint; and the dependence of the strength of the joint on time of preexposure to the environment. Overall, the theory is found to capture well the experimentally observed trends. Finally, we discuss how the model can be characterized on the basis of atomistic calculations, which opens the way for the systematic exploration of new material specifications.

Title: Enhancing Materials Discovery with Valence Constrained Design in Generative Modeling
Authors: Mouyang Cheng, Weiliang Luo, Hao Tang, Bowen Yu, Yongqiang Cheng, Weiwei Xie, Ju Li, Heather J. Kulik, Mingda Li
Abstract: Diffusion-based deep generative models have emerged as powerful tools for inverse materials design. Yet, many existing approaches overlook essential chemical constraints such as oxidation state balance, which can lead to chemically invalid structures. Here we introduce CrysVCD (Crystal generator with Valence-Constrained Design), a modular framework that integrates chemical rules directly into the generative process. CrysVCD first employs a transformer-based elemental language model to generate valence-balanced compositions, followed by a diffusion model to generate crystal structures. The valence constraint enables orders-of-magnitude more efficient chemical valence checking, compared to pure data-driven approaches with post-screening. When fine-tuned on stability metrics, CrysVCD achieves 85% thermodynamic stability and 68% phonon stability. Moreover, CrysVCD supports conditional generation of functional materials, enabling discovery of candidates such as high thermal conductivity semiconductors and high-$\kappa$ dielectric compounds. Designed as a general-purpose plugin, CrysVCD can be integrated into diverse generative pipeline to promote chemical validity, offering a reliable, scientifically grounded path for materials discovery.

Title: A comprehensive first principles investigation of A2BH6 type (A= Li,Na, and K; B= Al, and Si) double perovskite hydrides for high capacity hydrogen storage
Authors: R. Zosiamliana, Lalhriat Zuala, Shivraj Gurung, R. Lalmalsawma, A. Laref, A. Yvaz, D.P.Rai
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in vacancy-ordered double perovskite hydride materials have underscored their significant potential for integration into next-generation high-capacity hydrogen energy storage systems. We perform extensive first principles calculations leveraging both the GGA and hybrid-HSE06 functionals to systematically explore the intrinsic properties of A2BH6 complex hydrides. Thermodynamic stability for each hydride is demonstrated and confirmed by negative formation energies, determined by both the GGA and HSE06 formalisms. Additionally, mechanical stability is validated through compliance with Born's stability criteria. Electronic properties analysis reveals a semiconducting behavior in Si based hydrides (A2SiH6 ), whereas Al based (A2AlH6) display metallic nature, regardless of the A site atoms and functionals adopted. For the semiconducting hydrides, we have observed higher optical absorption peak greater than 106 (1/cm) in the UV regime indicating potential application in UV-optoelectronic devices. Furthermore, all studied compounds adhere to Debye's low-temperature specific heat behavior and converge to the classical Dulong-Petit limit at elevated temperatures, in accordance with fundamental thermodynamic principles. For hydrogen storage applications, both Al- and Si-based hydrides. meet key benchmarks set by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), achieving gravimetric hydrogen capacities (Cwt) exceeding 5.5 percent when A = Li or Na, and exhibiting volumetric hydrogen densities greater than 40 g.H2/L. Among all studied hydrides, Li2AlH6 and Li2SiH6 emerge as the two most promising candidates due to their outstanding Cwt greater than 12.0 percent , elevated density greater than 140 g.H2/L, and favorable hydrogen desorption temperature ranges TD = 450 to 650 K.

Title: Macroscopic fluctuation theory and the absorption of Brownian particles by partially reactive targets
Authors: Paul C Bressloff
Abstract: We use macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) to analyse current fluctuations in a non-interacting Brownian gas with one or more partially absorbing targets within a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \R^d$. We proceed by coarse-graining a generalised Dean-Kawasaki equation with Robin boundary conditions at the target surfaces. The exterior surface $\partial \Omega$ is maintained at a constant density $\owp$. We first derive MFT equations for the optimal noise-induced path for a single target under a saddle-point approximation of the associated path integral action. We then obtain the Gaussian distribution characterising small current fluctuations by linearising the MFT equations about the corresponding deterministic or noise-averaged system and solving the resulting stationary equations. The Robin boundary conditions are handled using the spectrum of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator defined on the target surface. We illustrate the theory by considering the finite interval and a circular annulus. In both cases we determine how the variance of the current depends on the rate of absorption $\kappa$. Finally, we extend our analysis to multiple partially absorbing targets. First, we obtain the general result that, in the case of partially absorbing targets ($0<\kappa<\infty$), the covariance matrix for current fluctuations supports cross correlations even in the absence of particle interactions. (These cross-correlations vanish in the totally absorbing limit $\kappa\rightarrow \infty$.) We then explicitly calculate the covariance matrix for circular targets in a 2D domain by assuming that the targets are much smaller than the characteristic size $L$ of the domain $\Omega$ and applying methods from singular perturbation theory.

Title: Spin-flop-like transition as quantum critical point in Cs$_2$RuO$_4$
Authors: S. D. Nabi, M. Zhu, K. Yu. Povarov, D. G. Mazzone, J. Lass, Y. Wu, Z. Yan, S. Gvasaliya, A. Zheludev
Abstract: We report thermodynamic, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering measurements on Cs$_2$RuO$_4$, a member of the celebrated family of frustrated magnets Cs$_2$MX$_4$ (M = Cu, Co, X = Br, Cl). Unlike the previously studied members, it is based on $4d$ transition metal ions with $S=1$. Mapping out the $H-T$ magnetic phase diagram reveals an unusual continuous spin-flop-like phase transition associated with a quantum critical point within the antiferromagnetically ordered phase. A quantitative analysis of the complex magnetic excitation spectrum measured in zero field allows us to derive a model magnetic Hamiltonian for this compound. Its main feature is a frustration of magnetic anisotropy on a level that is much higher than in any of the previously studied species. This frustration naturally explains the peculiar phase transition observed.

Title: Excitation of vortex core gyration in nanopillars through driven Floquet magnons
Authors: Gauthier Philippe, Joo-Von Kim
Abstract: The dynamics of vortex states in confined geometries like thin-film disks are characterized by a sub-GHz gyration, representing the damped oscillatory motion of the vortex core about the disk center. It has recently been shown that interactions between the core and azimuthal spin waves, lying in the GHz range and driven by magnetic fields, can result in steady-state core gyration. The gyration in turn provides a time-periodic modulation for the spin waves, resulting in the emergence of Floquet states. Here, we present results of a theoretical and computational study in which we examine how Floquet modes sustain this core gyration. In particular, we find that multiple steady-state gyration radii are possible under certain field conditions, resulting from the nonlinear interactions between the core and Floquet modes. Different gyration radii result in distinct Floquet frequency comb spectra and allow for hysteretic effects, as reported in recent experiments.

Title: Unraveling a chemical-bond-driven root of topology in three-dimensional chiral crystals
Authors: Shungo Aoyagi, Shunsuke Kitou, Yuiga Nakamura, Motoaki Hirayama, Hideki Matsuoka, Ryotaro Arita, Shuichi Murakami, Taka-hisa Arima, Naoya Kanazawa
Abstract: Chirality manifests across multiple scales, yielding unique phenomena that break mirror symmetry. In chiral materials, unexpectedly large spin-filtering or photogalvanic effects have been observed even in materials composed of light elements, implying crucial influence of their topological electronic states. However, an underlying framework that links chemical bonding and electronic topology remains elusive, preventing the rational design of quantum chiral properties. Here we identify the chiral bonding network responsible for multifold topological fermions by combining synchrotron X-ray diffraction and first-principles calculations on cubic chiral crystals, CoSi and FeSi. Based on the observations of asymmetric valence electron distributions around the transition metals, together with analyses of their bonding to sevenfold-coordinated silicon atoms, we develop a three-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, showing that inter-site hopping on this chiral network creates multifold fermions with doubled topological invariants. Topological features can be switched by reversing the crystalline chirality or tuning electron filling. Our results highlight that implementing strong spin-orbit coupling is not the sole route to realize robust topological phases at elevated temperatures and offer a practical design principle for exploiting chiral topology. Moreover, this real-space framework naturally extends to other elementary excitations or artificial metamaterials, enabling various quantum functionalities through an intuitive approach to chirality engineering.

Authors: M. Yu. Kagan, M. M. Korovushkin, V. A. Mitskan, K. I. Kugel, A. L. Rakhmanov, A. V. Rozhkov, A. O. Sboychakov
Abstract: It has been shown that the Kohn--Luttinger superconductivity mechanism interplaying with other types of ordering can be implemented in systems with a hexagonal lattice. A number of unusual properties of such systems in the normal phase have also been considered. Our previous results on Kohn--Luttinger superconductivity with $p$-, $d$-, and $f$-wave pairing in monolayer and AB bilayer graphene, obtained disregarding the effect of substrate potential and impurities, have been presented in the first part. Then, the interplay of the superconducting Kohn--Luttinger state with the spin density wave state in actual AB, AA, and twisted bilayer graphene has been discussed in detail. In the last parts, a number of anomalous properties in the normal phase and the appearance of nematic superconductivity alongside with the spin density wave in the twisted bilayer graphene have been presented.

Title: Density-dependent transport coefficients in two-dimensional cellular aggregates
Authors: Subhadip Chakraborti, Vasily Zaburdaev
Abstract: The large-scale collective behavior of biological systems can be characterized by macroscopic transport, which arises from the non-equilibrium microscopic interactions among individual constituents. A prominent example is the formation of dynamic aggregates by motile eukaryotic cells or bacteria mediated by active contractile forces. In this work, we develop the two-dimensional fluctuating hydrodynamics theory based on the microscopic dynamics of a model system of aggregation by \textit{Neisseria gonorrhoeae} bacteria. The derivation of two macroscopic transport coefficients of bulk diffusivity and conductivity which determine hydrodynamic current of cells is the central result of this work. By showing how transport coefficients depend on cell density and microscopic parameters of the system we predict transport slowdown during the colony formation process. This study provides valuable analytical tools for quantifying hydrodynamic transport in experimental systems involving cellular aggregation occurring due to intermittent contractile dipole forces.

Title: Exploration and aging of non-Markovian processes
Authors: Julien Brémont
Abstract: This thesis explores a central question: how does memory affect the way random walkers explore space? By analyzing various non-Markovian models, where past behavior directly influences future dynamics, we uncover new mechanisms and universal patterns in space exploration. In the first part, we study Locally Activated Random Walks (LARWs), where motion depends on the time spent at visited sites. These walks, though simply defined, display rich behaviors such as dynamical trapping, aging, and non-Gaussian diffusion. We identify confinement criteria, reveal a dynamical phase transition, and derive exact analytical results in several regimes. The second part focuses on Self-Interacting Random Walks (SIRWs), where the walker's own history governs future steps. Using advanced probabilistic tools, especially Ray-Knight theory, we compute exact results for observables such as splitting probabilities, persistence, first-passage times, number of visited sites, and aging effects. This includes the first exact expressions for aged observables in the saturating Self-Attracting Walk (SATW) model. In the third part, we propose a unified framework to describe memory effects in space exploration, based on the walker's tendency to reverse direction over time. This approach reveals robust patterns across a wide class of non-Markovian models, including fractional Brownian motion and the strongly self-interacting True Self-Avoiding Walk (TSAW), where we derive the first exact result for an aged observable in a non-saturating system. Together, these results show that memory-driven systems, though complex, can exhibit universal structures. This work offers new tools to analyze such dynamics and lays the groundwork for future research across physics, probability, and beyond.

Title: Specifics of ITO properties deposited on cerium-doped glass for space-grade solar cells
Authors: Danil D. Gren, Lev O. Luchnikov, Dmitri Yu. Dorofeev, Prokhor A. Alekseev, Ildar R. Sayarov, Alexey R. Tameev, Mikhail S. Dunaevskiy, Vladislav Kalinichenko, Vladimir Ivanov, Danila S. Saranin, Eugene I. Terukov
Abstract: Ce-doped glass is a well-established solution for ultraviolet and ionizing radiation shielding of solar cells in space. Traditionally, Ce-glass protected Si or III-V based devices as an overlaying cap. However, for emerging photovoltaics such as halide perovskites, thin Ce-glass coated with transparent conductive layers could serve as a lightweight carrier with an electrode. While indium-tin oxide (ITO) is widely used in solar cells for charge collection, its optical, structural, and electrical properties depend on the substrate quality. In this work, we demonstrated significant differences in properties of ITO deposited on Ce-glass (100 micron thick) compared to standard soda lime glass. ITO on Ce-glass exhibited pronounced compressive strain because of higher oxygen vacancy concentrations, reduced transparency and charge carrier concentration (10^19 cm-3) resulting from altered stoichiometry. Electrical analysis showed increased Hall mobility (66 cm2V-1s-1) but decreased conductivity due to excess tin incorporation. These specific ITO features originated from inelastic collisions with the substrate during deposition. Variations in wettability and surface potential underscore substrate-induced differences critical for developing optimized ITO coatings for space-grade photovoltaics.

Title: Spin-Type Photonic Topological Insulators on a Rhombic Lattice
Authors: Robert J. Davis, Daniel F. Sievenpiper
Abstract: A simplified model of a metallic spin-type photonic topological insulator on a rhombic lattice is presented and analyzed. Instead of the more commonly used hexagonal unit cells, a reduced symmetry rhombus is employed, which is both simpler and allows for easier integration into more traditional microwave systems. The non-trivial nature of the transport is shown via direct calculation of the structure's spin-projected Berry curvature and Wilson loop spectra, as well as by a systematic investigation of a reduced symmetry tight-binding model based off the Kane-Mele Hamiltonian. Device implementations are shown for a range of non-trivial configurations.

Title: A first-principles study on the early-stage corrosion of a NiWNb alloy in a chloride salt environment
Authors: Tyler D. Doležal, Adib J. Samin
Abstract: In this work a representative nickel superalloy, Ni70W20Nb10, was investigated in the presence of chlorine to quantify its early-stage dissolution behavior. Surface structures were generated from a bulk configuration sampled in equilibrium using a multi-cell Monte Carlo method for phase prediction. The predicted solid-phase at 800 C was Ni72W19Nb9 in a body-centered tetragonal crystal structure closely resembling the Ni4W structure. Chlorine adsorption onto the energetically favored (110) surface showed preference to niobium which acted as a trapping sink on the top surface of the slab model. Our findings suggested that niobium and tungsten enhanced the corrosion resistance of nickel as their presence created regions that were thermodynamically preferred by the incoming chlorine and less susceptible to chlorine-facilitated dissolution from the alloy. Nickel, niobium, and tungsten resisted chlorine-induced dissolution from the surface model up to a 1/3 monolayer coverage of chlorine indicating that all constituents of this alloy possessed superior resistance to localized surface degradation such as corrosive pitting. Further analysis and comparisons between the corrosion resistance of the three metallic species was performed. This work may provide insights that aid in the development of improved structural materials for molten salt reactors.

Title: On the adsorption of oxygen to high entropy alloy surfaces up to 2ML coverage using Density Functional Theory and Monte Carlo calculations
Authors: Tyler D. Doležal, Adib J. Samin
Abstract: To enhance our understanding of oxidation in high-entropy alloys, the early stages of oxidation on the surface of Al10Nb15Ta5Ti30Zr40 were studied using density functional theory and thermodynamic modeling. Surface slabs were generated from bulk configurations sampled from equilibrium using a multicell Monte Carlo method for phase prediction. The bulk structure was found to be a single BCC phase in good agreement with experimental observations. The oxygen adsorbed with a strong preference for sites with Ti and Zr and avoided sites with Nb-Al and Nb-Ta. The surface was shown to be highly reactive to oxygen, yielding a dominating oxygen coverage of two monolayers over the temperature range of 100 to 2600 K and an oxygen pressure range of 10-30 to 105 bar. Inward oxygen diffusion at low coverage was preferred in regions rich with Zr but slowed with the addition of Ti and Al. Diffusion rates drastically decreased at 1 ML, especially in the region rich with Ti and Zr, where strong metal-oxygen bonds were reported. Our results indicated that a high content of Ti and Zr increased the reactivity of the HEA surface to oxygen. The presence of Nb also enhanced the resistance to oxygen adsorption, especially when partnered with Al and Ta. Inward oxygen diffusion was likely to occur at low coverage in regions rich with Zr but could be protected against with the addition of Al and Ti. The limitations of the present work are discussed. This study may provide insights that assist with devising short- and long-term mitigation strategies against material degradation related to high-temperature oxidation.

Title: Mo-Re-W Alloys for High Temperature Applications: Phase Stability, Elasticity, and Thermal Property Insights via Multi-Cell Monte Carlo and Machine Learning
Authors: Tyler D. Doležal, Nick A. Valverde, Jodie Yuwono, Ryan Kemnitz
Abstract: The increasing demand for materials capable of withstanding high temperatures and harsh environments necessitates the discovery of advanced alloys. This study introduces a computational routine to predict solid-state phase stability and calculates elastic constants to determine high temperature viability. With it, machine learning models were trained on 1,014 Mo-Re-W structures to enable a large compilation of elastic and thermal properties over the complete Mo-Re-W compositional domain with extreme resolution. A series of heat maps spanning the full compositional domain were generated to visually present the impact of alloy constituents on the alloy properties. Our findings identified a balanced (Mo,W) + Re blend as a promising composition for high temperature applications, attributed to a strong and stable (Mo,W) matrix with high Re content and the formation of strengthening (W,Re) precipitates that enhanced mechanical performance at 1600oC. Several Mo-Re-W compositions were manufactured to experimentally validate the computational predictions. This approach provides an efficient and system-agnostic pathway for designing and optimizing alloys for high-temperature applications.

Title: Energy-Resolved EBSD using a Monolithic Direct Electron Detector
Authors: Nicolò M. Della Ventura, Kalani Moore, McLean P. Echlin, Matthew R. Begley, Tresa M. Pollock, Marc De Graef, Daniel S. Gianola
Abstract: Accurate quantification of the energy distribution of backscattered electrons (BSEs) contributing to electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns remains as an active challenge. This study introduces an energy-resolved EBSD methodology based on a monolithic active pixel sensor direct electron detector and an electron-counting algorithm to enable the energy quantification of individual BSEs, providing direct measurements of electron energy spectra within diffraction patterns. Following detector calibration of the detector signal as a function of primary beam energy, measurements using a 12 keV primary beam on Si(100) reveal a broad BSE energy distribution across the diffraction pattern, extending down to 3 keV. Furthermore, an angular dependence in the weighted average BSE energy is observed, closely matching predictions from Monte Carlo simulations. Pixel-resolved energy maps reveal subtle modulations at Kikuchi band edges, offering insights into the backscattering process. By applying energy filtering within spectral windows as narrow as 2 keV centered on the primary beam energy, significant enhancement in pattern clarity and high-frequency detail is observed. Notably, electrons in the 2--8 keV range, despite having undergone substantial energy loss ({\Delta}E = 4--10 keV), still produce Kikuchi patterns. By enabling energy determination at the single-electron level, this approach introduces a versatile tool-set for expanding the quantitative capabilities of EBSD, thereby offering the potential to deepen the understanding of diffraction contrast mechanisms and to advance the precision of crystallographic measurements.

Title: Absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in the Hubbard model on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice
Authors: Mahiro Futami
Abstract: By extending the strategy developed by Shiraishi in 2019, we prove that the standard Hubbard model on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ does not admit any nontrivial local conserved quantities. The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.

Title: Cluster dynamics modeling of hydrogen saturation retention in tungsten with a universal trapping-site sink strength
Authors: Yuanyuan Zhang, Xiaoru Chen Chuanguo Zhang, Yonggang Li
Abstract: Hydrogen isotope (HI) retention poses a key issue for tungsten (W)-based plasma-facing materials (PFMs) in fusion devices, where microstructures such as dislocations (DLs) and grain boundaries (GBs) play a dominant role. Existing theoretical sink strength models for microstructures like DLs and GBs fail to account for the observed saturation of HI retention. In this study, we propose a novel universal trapping-site model that dynamically represents sink strengths as time-dependent site concentrations, which is incorporated into an improved cluster dynamics model for high-fluence HI irradiation. Our simulations quantitatively reproduce the saturated low-energy deuterium (D) retention and depth profiles in W, in good agreement with experiments. A critical saturation fluence of approximately 1023 m-2 is identified, below which unsaturated D retention is governed by both GBs and ion-induced defects, whereas above this threshold GBs dominate D retention by trapping free D and approaching their theoretical saturation limit. The trapping-site sink strength model enables quantification of H trapping by diverse microstructures via unified effective site concentrations, providing mechanistic insights into microstructural effects and facilitating direct evaluation of HI retention in PFMs under different irradiation conditions.

Title: Superconductivity emerging from the N${é}$el state in ${\it infinite}$-${\it stage}$ single-layer cuprate La$_2$CuO$_{4+δ}$
Authors: Yoshihiko Ihara, Ramender Kumar, Kota Miyakoshi, Migaku Oda, Kenji Ishida
Abstract: In copper oxides (cuprates) with single CuO$_2$ layer such as La$_{2-x}$Ba(Sr)$_x$CuO$_4$, antiferromagnetism coexists with superconductivity at small doping levels $x$, where chemical disorders are significant. Here, we report that superconductivity occurs in a uniform and fully ordered N${é}$el state in a single-layer cuprate La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ with a small amount of excess oxygen $(\delta = 0.015)$ as demonstrated by the $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance measurement. A uniform oxygen distribution in the crystal is crucial for achieving microscopic phase coexistence and overcoming the miscibility gap associated with the staging instability; self-organized periodic oxygen arrangement driven by mobile oxygen atoms. This finding prompts the reconsideration of superconductivity in cuprates, highlighting that it can emerge in a robust N${é}$el state that retains sizable magnetic moments and hosts only a small carrier density.

Title: Quasiparticle interaction originating from Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces under pressure in 18%-S substituted FeSe studied via NMR
Authors: Zhongyu Yu, Xiaoling Shen, Koya Nakamura, Kazuya Inomata, Kohei Matsuura, Yuta Mizukami, Shigeru Kasahara, Yuji Matsuda, Takasada Shibauchi, Yoshiya Uwatoko, Naoki Fujiwara
Abstract: S-substituted FeSe superconductors in the tetragonal phase display several unique features among iron-based superconductors, particularly the presence of zero-energy excitations in the superconducting (SC) this http URL recent concept of Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces (BFSs), a theoretical model describing ultranodal states, has attracted considerable interest. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (x=0.18) have revealed an anomalous low-energy spin fluctuations deep in the SC state. The low-energy spin fluctuations are enhanced with decreasing temperature, supporting strong Bogoliubov quasiparticle interactions associated with BFSs. Here, we further investigate these correlation effects through $^{77}$Se-NMR measurements of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (x=0.18) under pressures up to 2.0 GPa and temperatures down to ~100 mK. The results demonstrate that the anomalous enhancement is suppressed but persists under pressure, implying that quasiparticle interactions become weak by applying pressure. Furthermore, spin fluctuations in the normal state exhibit different temperature dependence from those deep in the SC state, suggesting that the nesting properties of normal electrons differ from those of Bogoliubov quasiparticles. These findings are consistent with the theoretical model of BFSs with C$_2$ symmetry and strengthen evidence for Bogoliubov quasiparticle interactions, providing insights into the unconventional pairing state of this system.

Title: Finite size effect in the persistence probability of the Edwards-Wilkinson model of surface growth and effect of non-linearity
Authors: Anirban Ghosh, Dipanjan Chakraborty
Abstract: The dynamical evolution of the surface height is controlled by either a linear or a nonlinear Langevin equation, depending on the underlying microscopic dynamics, and is often done theoretically using stochastic coarse-grained growth equations. The persistence probability $p(t)$ of stochastic models of surface growth that are constrained by a finite system size is examined in this work. We focus on the linear Edwards-Wilkinson model (EW) and the nonlinear Kardar-Parisi-Zhang model, two specific models of surface growth. The persistence exponents in the continuum version of these two models have been widely investigated. Krug et al.[Phys. Rev. E , 56:2702-2712, (1997)] and Kallabis et al. [EPL (Europhysics Letters) , 45(1):20, 1999] had shown that, the steady-state persistence exponents for both these models are related to the growth exponent $\beta$ as $\theta=1-\beta$. It is numerically found that the values of persistence exponents for both these models are close to the analytically predicted values. While the results of the continuum equations of the surface growth are well known, we focus to study the persistence probability expressions for discrete models with a finite size effect. In this article, we have investigated the persistence probabilities for the linear Edwards-Wilkinson(EW) model and for the non-linear Kardar-Parisi-Zhang(KPZ) model of surface growth on a finite one-dimensional lattice. The interesting phenomenon which is found in this case is that the known scenario of $p(t)$ of the following algebraic decay vanishes as we introduce a finite system size.

Title: Biorthogonal quench dynamics of entanglement and quantum geometry in PT-symmetric non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Hsueh-Hao Lu, Po-Yao Chang
Abstract: We explore the quench dynamics of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian systems by utilizing the biorthogonal formalism. We analyze quench dynamics of observable quantities, the quantum geometric tensor, and various entanglement quantities, including the entanglement entropy, the SVD entropy, and the Tu-Tzeng-Chang entropy. Our results show that a sudden quench into a PT-broken phase generally leads to exponential growth in these quantities, driven by the biorthogonal density matrix's non-positivity. In contrast to generic interacting systems, we observe a surprising linear decay in the TTC entropy for non-interacting fermionic systems. This finding originates from the approximate spectral symmetry of the biorthogonal reduced density matrix, and we confirm our findings using the Yang-Lee and non-Hermitian XXZ models.

Title: Inelastic Neutron Scattering for Direct Detection of Chiral Phonons
Authors: Tingting Wang, Jun Zhou, Qingyong Ren, Lifa Zhang
Abstract: Chiral phonons have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in spintronics, superconductivity, and advanced materials, but their detection has predominantly relied on indirect photon-involved processes. Here, we propose inelastic neutron scattering (INS) as a direct and versatile approach for chiral phonon detection over a broad momentum-energy space. Leveraging INS sensitivity to phonon eigenmodes, we clearly distinguish linear, elliptical, and chiral phonons and determine phonon handedness through angle-resolved measurements. Using right-handed tellurium (Te) as a model system, we identify characteristic INS fingerprints that clearly separate chiral from linear phonons. Moreover, we show that INS can directly access phonon magnetic moments and the effective magnetic fields generated by chiral phonons, as evidenced by the pronounced mode splitting in CeF$_3$. Collectively, these results position INS as a powerful platform for comprehensive investigations of chiral-phonon dynamics and their associated quantum phenomena.

Title: Knot-Driven Spin Selectivity: Topological Chirality-Induced Robust Spin Polarization in Molecular Knots
Authors: Xi Sun, Kai-Yuan Zhang, Shu-Zheng Zhou, Hua-Hua Fu
Abstract: Compared to traditional structural chiral materials (e.g., DNA, helicene), topological chirality in trefoil knot molecules has demonstrated multiple remarkable advantages in chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), including ultra-high spin polarization of nearly 90%, conductivity increased by two orders of magnitude, and high-temperature stability (up to 350$^{\circ}$C). However, the underlying physical mechanism remains elusive. This work establishes, for the first time, a fundamental theoretical framework for topological chirality-induced spin selectivity (TCISS) in trefoil knot molecules and identifies the necessary conditions for knot-driven spin selectivity. Our calculation results reveal that a trefoil knot molecule can exhibit spin polarization exceeding 60% along with significant conductivity. Notably, neither reducing the lattice number nor applying strain regulation significantly diminishes this ultra-high spin polarization, highlighting its robustness. Importantly, when the topological knot degenerates into a trivial structure, accompanied by the transition from topological chirality to structural chirality, the spin polarization sharply declines, demonstrating a strong correlation between the ultrahigh spin polarization and the knot topology. Our theory not only successfully elucidates the physical mechanism of TCISS, but also uncovers a new spin-polarized transport phenomenon termed knot-driven spin selectivity, offering new guiding principles for designing nonmagnetic materials for spintronics device applications.

Title: Time-bin qubit architecture using quantum Hall edge channels
Authors: David Pomaranski, Michihisa Yamamoto
Abstract: We present the basic elements for a modular architecture for time-bin encoded qubits based on quantum Hall edge channels, forming the foundation of a scalable electronic quantum information platform named TEMPO (Time-binned Electronic Modular Platform for Qubits). Quantum states are encoded in temporally separated edge magnetoplasmon (EMP) wave packets propagating along a single chiral edge, eliminating the need for spatial path separation and enhancing coherence. The platform supports full qubit operations$\unicode{x2013}$including initialization, phase modulation, readout, and two-qubit entangling gates$\unicode{x2013}$by leveraging dynamically tunable quantum point contacts and electrostatic control of interferometric loops. We consider the linear dispersion and gate-induced velocity control on EMP propagation and describe strategies for maintaining waveform integrity. Various single-electron sources, including ohmic injection and capacitive excitation, are discussed in the context of coherence. Multi-qubit operations are enabled through synchronized injection and engineered Coulomb interactions between adjacent channels, while single-qubit readout is addressed via spin-based or capacitive charge sensors. Our approach integrates gate-tunable coherent control of chiral edge states, offering a comprehensive pathway toward scalable electron quantum optics in solid-state platforms.

Title: High-reflectivity homoepitaxial distributed Bragg reflectors for photonic applications
Authors: Helena Janowska, Anna Musiał, Grzegorz Sęk
Abstract: Distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) are one of the basic photonic structures used to define microcavities for fundamental light-matter coupling studies, as well as to optimize performance of optoelectronic and photonic devices, e.g., lasers or non-classical light sources. The reflectivity of these structures depends critically on the refractive index contrast between the two quarter-wavelength thick layers constituting the DBR. At the same time, epitaxial fabrication process limits the choice of materials to those with the same, or very similar lattice constant to avoid strain accumulation in the relatively thick multilayer structure. This becomes very often a bottleneck for the DBR designs at certain wavelengths or for some of the material systems. Therefore, we explore theoretically DBR designs employing the reflective index contrast between undoped and doped layers of the same material, making the entire growth process homoepitaxial. The refractive index for a doped layer is calculated taking into account the free carrier absorption, carrier-carrier interaction, the Burnstein-Moss and plasma effects. The reflectivity spectrum of a DBR is further calculated using transfer matrix method. Exemplary results for three application relevant materials - hBN, InP and Si suitable for different spectral ranges, i.e. ultraviolet, telecommunication and mid-infrared, respectively, are presented. We report reflectivities on the level of 90\% for technologically achievable doping concentrations and moderate number of layer pairs.

Title: Eigenvalue spectral tails and localization properties of asymmetric networks
Authors: Pietro Valigi, Joseph W. Baron, Izaak Neri, Giulio Biroli, Chiara Cammarota
Abstract: In contrast to the neatly bounded spectra of densely populated large random matrices, sparse random matrices often exhibit unbounded eigenvalue tails on the real and imaginary axis, called Lifshitz tails. In the case of asymmetric matrices, concise mathematical results have proved elusive. In this work, we present an analytical approach to characterising these tails. We exploit the fact that eigenvalues in the tail region have corresponding eigenvectors that are exponentially localised on highly-connected hubs of the network associated to the random matrix. We approximate these eigenvectors using a series expansion in the inverse connectivity of the hub, where successive terms in the series take into account further sets of next-nearest neighbours. By considering the ensemble of such hubs, we are able to characterise the eigenvalue density and the extent of localisation in the tails of the spectrum in a general fashion. As such, we classify a number of different asymptotic behaviours in the Lifshitz tails, as well as the leading eigenvalue and the inverse participation ratio. We demonstrate how an interplay between matrix asymmetry, network structure, and the edge-weight distribution leads to the variety of observed behaviours.

Title: A Gross-Pitaevskii theory for an excitonic incompressible Bose solid
Authors: Sara Conti, Andrey Chaves, Alexander R. Hamilton, Jacques Tempere, Milorad V. Milosevic, David Neilson
Abstract: We show that interlayer excitons in double-layer semiconductor heterostructures can form a Bose solid, which is an incompressible supersolid characterized by exactly one boson per lattice site. This exciton Bose solid would be the first realization of an incompressible supersolid, unlike the generally compressible cluster supersolids seen in dipolar quantum gases. Capturing its characteristics and associated emergent phenomena requires extending the Gross-Pitaevskii formalism to include strong two-particle correlations and exclude exciton self-interactions. We develop such a formalism, we apply it across experimentally accessible exciton densities and interlayer separations, and we show that it incorporates both superfluid and incompressible supersolid ground states. This extended framework allows us to determine the superfluid-supersolid transition and explore the low-temperature properties of the exciton supersolid across its complete parameter space.

Title: Electron transport through mesoscopic junctions revisited
Authors: Robert Alicki
Abstract: Theoretical foundations of electron transport in mesoscopic systems, based on Landauer theory, Master equations or Onsager linear thermodynamics, are revisited to show that the noniteracting electrons model is insufficient to describe neither passive transport, nor generation of electromotive force (active transport). It is argued that 2-body electrostatic interactions creating double layers and surface charge distributions are crucial for the electron transport through a junction. Phenomenological modifications of the passive transport formulas based on the carefull analysis of the fundamental notions of chemical, electrostatic, electrochemical, build-in potentials, band bending and bias voltage, are proposed. On the other hand active transport can be generated by a self-oscillating double layer (a pump ) driven by an external heat, light or chemical energy source.

Title: Quantum Imaging of Ferromagnetic van der Waals Magnetic Domain Structures at Ambient Conditions
Authors: Bindu, Amandeep Singh, Amir Hen, Lukas Drago Cavar, Sebastian Maria Ulrich Schultheis, Shira Yochelis, Yossi Paltiel, Andrew F. May, Angela Wittmann, Mathias Klaui, Dmitry Budker, Hadar Steinberg, Nir Bar-Gill
Abstract: Recently discovered 2D van der Waals magnetic materials, and specifically Iron-Germanium-Telluride ($\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$), have attracted significant attention both from a fundamental perspective and for potential applications. Key open questions concern their domain structure and magnetic phase transition temperature as a function of sample thickness and external field, as well as implications for integration into devices such as magnetic memories and logic. Here we address key questions using a nitrogen-vacancy center based quantum magnetic microscope, enabling direct imaging of the magnetization of $\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$ at sub-micron spatial resolution as a function of temperature, magnetic field, and thickness. We employ spatially resolved measures, including magnetization variance and cross-correlation, and find a significant spread in transition temperature yet with no clear dependence on thickness down to 15 nm. We also identify previously unknown stripe features in the optical as well as magnetic images, which we attribute to modulations of the constituting elements during crystal synthesis and subsequent oxidation. Our results suggest that the magnetic anisotropy in this material does not play a crucial role in their magnetic properties, leading to a magnetic phase transition of $\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$ which is largely thickness-independent down to 15 nm. Our findings could be significant in designing future spintronic devices, magnetic memories and logic with 2D van der Waals magnetic materials.

Title: Nonequilibrium Dynamics in a Quantum Spin Chain with Pump-Probe Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering
Authors: Menglian Shi, Zhengzhong Du, Yi Lu
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of the transverse field Ising chain (TFIC) using time-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (tr-RIXS) in a pump-probe setup within a condensed matter setting. The tr-RIXS spectra reveal distinctive features, including two-kink continua at high energies and oscillatory spectral weight at low energies, both strongly influenced by the pump dynamics. By systematically analyzing the nonequilibrium tr-RIXS cross section under various pump configurations, we demonstrate how the spectra encode detailed information about the system's transient states, capturing instantaneous Hamiltonian parameters and the traversal of equilibrium quantum critical points during dynamic evolution. Notably, we uncover a one-to-one correspondence between oscillatory features in the low-energy spectra and dynamical quantum phase transitions, offering a novel and experimentally accessible approach for their detection. These findings highlight the versatility of tr-RIXS as a powerful tool for studying quantum systems far from equilibrium and their critical phenomena.

Title: Type-II Antiferroelectricity
Authors: Yang Wang, Chaoxi Cui, Yilin Han, Tingli He, Weikang Wu, Run-Wu Zhang, Zhi-Ming Yu, Shengyuan A. Yang, Yugui Yao
Abstract: Antiferroelectricity (AFE) is a fundamental concept in physics and materials science. Conventional AFEs have the picture of alternating local electric dipoles defined in real space. Here, we discover a new class of AFEs, termed type-II AFEs, which possess opposite polarizations defined in momentum space across a pair of symmetry decoupled subspaces. Unlike conventional AFEs, the order parameter of type-II AFEs is rigorously formulated through Berry-phase theory and can be quantitatively extracted from the electronic band structure. Focusing on a subclass of type-II AFEs that preserve spin-rotation symmetry, we establish the relevant symmetry constraints and identify all compatible spin point groups. Remarkably, we find that type-II AFE order intrinsically coexists with antiferromagnetism, revealing a robust form of magnetoelectric coupling. We construct an altermagnetic model and identify several concrete antiferromagnetic/altermagnetic materials, such as FeS, Cr2O3, MgMnO3, monolayer MoICl2 and bilayer CrI3, that exhibit this novel ordering. Furthermore, we uncover unique physical phenomena associated with type-II spin-AFE systems, including spin current generation upon AFE switching and localized spin polarization at boundaries and domain walls. Our findings reveal a previously hidden class of quantum materials with intertwined ferroic orders, offering exciting opportunities for both fundamental exploration and technological applications.

Title: Pairing without $γ$-Pocket in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Film
Authors: Zhi-Yan Shao, Chen Lu, Min Liu, Yu-Bo Liu, Zhiming Pan, Congjun Wu, Fan Yang
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film at ambient pressure has aroused great research interest. The $\gamma$-pocket formed by the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band, which was previously proposed to be crucial in the pairing mechanism of pressurized bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, is reported to be either present or absent here by different experimental groups, giving rise to the problem: what is the pairing mechanism and pairing nature without the $\gamma$-pocket? Here, we start from a band structure obtained via density-functional-theoretical calculation, which exhibits no $\gamma$-pocket. Then, equipped with electron interactions, we study the pairing nature via combined weak- and strong- coupling approaches, which provide consistent results. In the weak-coupling study, the nesting between the $\alpha$- and $\beta$- pockets leads to an $s^\pm$-wave pairing in which the gap signs on the two pockets are opposite, as provided by our random-phase-approximation based calculations. In real-space, the pairing pattern is dominated by the interlayer pairing of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. In the strong-coupling study, as the $d_{z^2}$ orbitals are nearly half-filled and hence localized, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals carry the HTSC. Driven by the interlayer superexchange transferred from the $d_{z^2}$ orbital through the Hund's rule coupling, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital electrons form interlayer $s$-wave pairing, as suggested by our slave-boson-mean-field study on the related two-orbital $t$-$J$ model. Projected onto the Fermi surface, this pairing just gives the $s^\pm$-wave pattern consistent with that obtained in the weak-coupling study. Our result is consistent with that obtained in recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiment.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots are a promising platform for generating single and entangled this http URL, their use is limited even in the most advanced structures by changes in the charge state of the quantum dot and its environment. Here, we present detailed time-resolved resonance fluorescence measurements on a single charge-tunable GaAs quantum dot, shedding new light on the spectral shadows invoked by the complex impurity environment. Detuning-dependent measurements reveal the existence of multiple Stark-shifted resonances, which are associated with rare spectral jumps smaller than the homogeneous linewidth and, therefore, typically concealed in the measurement noise. We observe similar environmentally induced Stark shifts for both the neutral exciton and negatively charged trion transitions, while the positively and doubly negatively charged trions exhibit significant differences. Our investigation quantifies the underlying impurity charge dynamics over a range from well below milliseconds to seconds, revealing that the hole occupation of the positively charged trion transition is constrained by rapid hole loss and slow hole recapture dynamics. Utilizing a second non-resonant laser, we increase the hole occupancy by over an order of magnitude and identify both a prolonged hole residence time and an enhanced hole tunneling rate into the quantum dot. These findings are supported by complementary spin noise spectroscopy measurements, which offer a significantly higher bandwidth compared to the time-resolved resonance fluorescence measurements.

Title: Variational study of the magnetization plateaus of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet and its implication on YCOB
Authors: Rong Cheng, Tao Li
Abstract: Numerical simulations find that there are multiple plateaus in the magnetization curve of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kagome antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model(KAFH) at fractional magnetization $m=1/9,1/3,5/9,7/9$. While it is well known that the $m=1/3,5/9,7/9$ plateau feature a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ valence bond crystal(VBC) ordering pattern with a David-star-shaped motif, the origin of the narrow plateau at $m=1/9$ remains elusive. Some researchers claim that a subtle translational symmetry breaking pattern with the same $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ periodicity occurs at the $m=1/9$ plateau. On the other hand, it has also been argued that the $m=1/9$ plateau may harbor a novel $Z_{3}$ chiral spin liquid phase. To resolve this controversy, we have proposed the most general variational ansatz based on the resonating valence bond(RVB) picture that is consistent with the spin symmetry of the system and developed a new algorithm to optimize such a complicated ansatz. We find that a peculiar VBC state with a $3\times3$ periodicity and a windmill-shaped motif has significantly lower energy than the claimed $Z_{3}$ chiral spin liquid state and other proposed VBC states around the $m=1/9$ plateau. We find that there are strong spatial modulation in the local magnetization at the $1/9$ plateau, so strong that even its polarization can be reversed. Our general RVB ansatz also well reproduces all other more conventional magnetization plateaus of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ KAFH. We find that the local magnetization is always strongly inhomogeneous below the saturating field for such a strongly frustrated quantum magnet.

Title: Two fluctuating interfaces with sticking interactions: Invariant measures and dynamics
Authors: Samvit Mahapatra, Malay Bandyopadhyay, Mustansir Barma
Abstract: We introduce and study a non-equilibrium stochastic model of two fluctuating interfaces which interact through short-range attractive interactions at their points of contact. Beginning from an entangled state, the system exhibits diverse dynamics -- ranging from fast transients with small lifetimes to ultraslow evolution through quasi-stationary states -- and reaches stuck, entangled, or detached steady states. Near the stuck-detached transition, two distinct dynamical modes of evolution co-occur. When the two surfaces evolve through similar dynamics (both Edwards-Wilkinson or both Kardar-Parisi-Zhang), the invariant measure is determined and found to have an inhomogeneous product form. This exact steady state is shown to be the measure of the equilibrium Poland-Scheraga model of DNA denaturation.

Title: Third-order strong-coupling impurity solver for real-frequency DMFT: Accurate spectral functions for antiferromagnetic and photo-doped states
Authors: Lei Geng, Aaram J. Kim, Philipp Werner
Abstract: We present a real-frequency third-order strong-coupling impurity solver which employs quantics tensor cross interpolation (QTCI) for an efficient evaluation of the diagram weights. Applying the method to dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations of the single-band Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice, we clarify the interaction and temperature range in which the third-order approach yields accurate results. Since the calculations are implemented on the real-time/frequency axis, the detailed structure of spectral functions can be obtained without analytical continuation, as we demonstrate with examples for paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic and photo-doped states. Our work establishes a viable path toward high-order, real-frequency impurity solvers for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium DMFT studies.

Title: Angle-dependent chiral tunneling in biased twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Nadia Benlakhouy, El Mustapha Feddi, Abdelouahed El Fatimy
Abstract: In twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG), chiral tunneling can be tuned by parameters such as the twist angle, barrier height, and Fermi energy. This differs from the tunneling behavior observed in monolayer and Bernal bilayer graphene, where electrons either pass completely through or are fully blocked due to the Klein paradox. Here we investigate the effect of a perpendicular interlayer bias on electron tunneling through electrostatic barriers in TBLG. Using a dual-gated model, which controls the carrier density and interlayer potential difference independently, we compute the transmission and reflection probabilities of electrons at different angles and energies for representative twist angles of $\theta = 1.8^{\circ}$, $3.89^{\circ}$, and $9.43^{\circ}$. We find that a moderate bias suppresses normal-incidence transmission by opening a band gap in the low-energy spectrum. Our results show this leads to near-total reflection at low energy, with transmission starting to increase just above the gap due to twist-dependent conducting channels. The applied bias breaks the system's effective inversion symmetry, resulting in pronounced direction-dependent and valley-specific asymmetries in the angular distribution of transmitted electrons. We show that electrons incident at different angles show notable variations in transmission under bias. Furthermore, interlayer bias modulates Fabry--Pérot--like resonances in the TBLG barrier, shifting the energies of transmission peaks and altering their intensity.

Title: Low-energy atomic scattering: s-wave relation between the interaction potential and the phase shift
Authors: Francesco Lorenzi, Luca Salansich
Abstract: We investigate the on-shell approximation in the context of s-wave scattering for ultracold two-body collisions. Our analysis systematically covers spatial dimensions D=1,2,3 , with the aim of identifying the regimes in which the approximation remains valid when applied to commonly used model interaction potentials. Specifically, we focus on the square well and delta shell potentials, both of which admit analytical solutions for the s-wave scattering problem in all dimensions considered. By employing the exact analytical expressions for the s-wave scattering phase shift, we perform a direct comparison between the exact on-shell matrix element of the interaction potential and their corresponding approximations across a range of collision momenta. Particular attention is given to the low-energy regime. Our findings indicate that, although the on-shell approximation generally improves with increasing momentum, its accuracy also improves for weaker potentials. Remarkably, in the limit of weak interactions, we demonstrate that the on-shell approximation becomes exact at leading order. In this regime, the approximation offers a controlled means of deriving the low-momentum expansion of the potential and may serve as a useful tool in constructing effective interactions for quantum field theories.

Title: Entanglement Halos
Authors: Nadir Samos Sáenz de Buruaga, Silvia N. Santalla, Germán Sierra, Javier Rodríguez-Laguna
Abstract: We introduce the concept of entanglement halos, a set of strongly entangled distant sites within the ground state of a quantum many-body system. Such halos emerge in star-like systems with exponentially decaying couplings, as we show using both free-fermions and the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. Depending on the central connectivity, entanglement halos may exhibit trivial and non trivial symmetry-protected topological features. Our findings highlight how geometry and connectivity can generate complex entanglement structures with rich physical content, which can be experimentally accessible via state-of-the-art technologies.

Title: Adjudicating Conduction Mechanisms in High Performance Carbon Nanotube Fibers

Susner, David Turner, Pengyu Fu, Teresa Kulka, Jacek Majewski, Irina Lebedeva, Karolina Z. Milowska, Agnieszka Lekawa-Raus, Magdalena Marganska
Abstract: The performance of carbon nanotube (CNT) cables, a contender for copper-wire replacement, is tied to its metallic and semi-conducting-like conductivity responses with temperature; the origin of the semi-conducting-like response however is an underappreciated incongruity in literature. With controlled aspect-ratio and doping-degree, over 61 unique cryogenic experiments including anisotropy and Hall measurements, CNT cable performance is explored at extreme temperatures (65 mK) and magnetic fields (60 T). A semi-conducting-like conductivity response with temperature becomes temperature-independent approaching absolute-zero, uniquely demonstrating the necessity of heterogeneous fluctuation induced tunneling; complete de-doping leads to localized hopping, contrasting graphite's pure metallic-like response. High-field magneto-resistance (including +22% longitudinal magneto-resistance near room-temperature) is analyzed with hopping and classical two-band models, both similarly yielding a parameter useful for conductor development. Varying field-orientation angle uncovers two-and four-fold symmetries from Aharonov-Bohm-like corrections to curvature-induced bandgap. Tight-binding calculations using Green's Function formalism model large-scale, coherent transport in commensurate CNT bundles in magnetic field, revealing non-uniform transmission across bundle cross-sections with doping restoring uniformity; independent of doping, transport in bundle-junction-bundle systems are predominantly from CNTs adjacent to the other bundle. The final impact is predicting the ultimate conductivity of heterogeneous CNT cables using temperature and field-dependent transport, surpassing conductivity of traditional metals.

Title: Predicting Chemically Accurate Adsorption Energy Using an Interpretable Deep Learning Model Pretrained by GGA Calculation Data
Authors: Zhihao Zhang, Xiao-Ming Cao
Abstract: Molecular adsorption energy is a critical descriptor for high-throughput screening of heterogeneous catalysts and electrode materials. However, precise experimental adsorption energies are scarce due to the complexity of experiments, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations remain computationally expensive for large-scale material screening. Machine learning models trained on DFT data have emerged as a promising alternative, but face challenges such as functional dependency, limited labeled high-fidelity data, and interpretability issues. Herein, we present DOS Transformer for Adsorption (DOTA), a novel deep learning model that leverages local density of states (LDOS) as input to predict chemically accurate adsorption energies across metallic and intermetallic surfaces. DOTA integrates multi-head self-attention mechanisms with LDOS feature engineering to capture orbital interaction patterns, achieving superior accuracy and transferability. Pretrained on PBE-level DFT data, DOTA can be fine-tuned using minimal high-fidelity experimental or hybrid functional data to predict adsorption energies with chemical accuracy. The model resolves long-standing challenges, such as the "CO puzzle" and outperforms traditional theories, like the d-band center and Fermi softness models. It provides a robust framework for efficient catalyst and electrode screening, bridging the gap between computational and experimental approaches.

Title: Synchronized Circular Motion of Optically Confined Marangoni Microswimmers
Authors: Sabera M. Borno, Robin Khisa, Israt H. Zarin, Md Hasan Mahmud, Nicholas D. Brubaker, Ryan C. Hayward, Nabila Tanjeem
Abstract: Understanding the collective actuation of microscopic structures driven by external fields can lead to the development of next-generation autonomous machines. With this goal in mind, we investigated light-induced collective motion of thermocapillary microswimmers at the air-water interface. We found that Marangoni forces, which lead to long-ranged repulsive interparticle interactions, can cause microswimmers to synchronize their circular motion in a collective chase mode that resembles predator-prey behavior often observed in nature. We examined different degrees of confinement in small systems containing 2-6 particles of different individual swimming velocities and shapes. Thanks to the strong repulsive interactions between particles, a sustained chasing mode was observed for particle packing fractions above a critical value of 0.25. At lower packing fractions, swimmers transition between chasing, bouncing, and intermittent pausing, likely due to time-varying activity levels. Additionally, we report that a new synchronized mode can be introduced by incorporating chirality in particle shapes, where the microswimmers collectively reverse the direction of their circular motion periodically. Our results point to a simple but powerful mechanism of obtaining collective synchronization in synthetic confined systems where particles are designed with different shapes and activity levels.

Title: Geometric Superfluid Weight in Quasicrystals
Authors: Junsong Sun, Huaiming Guo, Bohm-Jung Yang
Abstract: We study the geometric contribution to the superfluidity in quasicrystals in which the conventional momentum-space quantum geometric tensor cannot be defined due to the lack of translational invariance. Based on the correspondence between the momentum and magnetic flux, we introduce the flux-space quantum metric in finite-size closed systems and reveal its contribution to the superfluid weight in quasicrystalline superconductors. As a toy model, we study the attractive Hubbard model on the Fibonacci quasiperiodic stub lattices that host flat energy spectra even in the presence of quasiperiodic hoppings. In the weak-coupling limit, we establish the relation between superfluid weight and the flux-space quantum metric in quasicrystal superconductors with flat energy spectra. Moreover, by analyzing the spread of Wannier functions, we propose a general fluctuation mechanism that explains how quasiperiodicity modulates the integrated flux-space quantum metric. Our theory provides a general way to examine the effect of the quantum geometry in systems lacking translational symmetry.

Title: Revealing Atomic-Scale Switching Pathways in van der Waals Ferroelectrics
Authors: Xinyan Li, Kenna Ashen, Chuqiao Shi, Nannan Mao, Saagar Kolachina, Kaiwen Yang, Tianyi Zhang, Sajid Husain, Ramamoorthy Ramesh, Jing Kong, Xiaofeng Qian, Yimo Han
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials hold the potential for ultra-scaled ferroelectric (FE) devices due to their silicon compatibility and robust polarization down to atomic scale. However, the inherently weak vdW interactions enable facile sliding between layers, introducing complexities beyond those encountered in conventional ferroelectric materials and presenting significant challenges in uncovering intricate switching pathways. Here, we combine atomic-resolution imaging under in-situ electrical biasing conditions with first-principles calculations to unravel the atomic-scale switching mechanisms in SnSe, a vdW group-IV monochalcogenide. Our results uncover the coexistence of a consecutive 90 degrees switching pathway and a direct 180 degrees switching pathway from antiferroelectric (AFE) to FE order in this vdW system. Atomic-scale investigations and strain analysis reveal that the switching processes simultaneously induce interlayer sliding and compressive strain, while the lattice remains coherent despite the presence of multidomain structures. These findings elucidate vdW ferroelectric switching dynamics at atomic scale and lay the foundation for the rational design of 2D ferroelectric nanodevices.

Title: Finite-momentum mixed singlet-triplet pairing in chiral antiferromagnets induced by even-parity spin texture
Authors: Song-Bo Zhang, Lun-Hui Hu
Abstract: Non-relativistic spin-splitting in unconventional antiferromagnets has garnered much attention for its promising spintronic applications and open fundamental questions. Here, we uncover a unique even-parity spin texture in chiral non-collinear antiferromagnets, exemplified using a kagome lattice. We consider two distinct types of electrons in the system: one with Schrödinger-like dispersion and the other exhibiting Dirac-like behavior. Remarkably, we show that, for both electron types, this spin texture induces an exotic coexistence of opposite-spin singlet and equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs with finite momentum when proximity-coupled to conventional superconductors. The triplet pairing arises from the intrinsic spin rotation of the antiferromagnet and does not require net magnetization or spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, we identify an unprecedented and tunable phase difference between singlet and triplet pairings, controllable through junction orientation. This mixed pairing state can be experimentally probed via damped oscillations in order parameters and 0-$\pi$ transitions in Josephson junctions. Additionally, we analyze the effect of out-of-plane spin canting, elucidating its role in generating spin-polarized supercurrents, and discuss Mn$_3$Ga and Mn$_3$Ge to test our predictions.

Title: A set of nearly good real numbers to specify the eigenstates of a medium-body system with two kinds of spin-1 cold atoms and with the Hamiltonian containing non-commutable terms
Authors: Yanzhang He, Yimin Liu, Chengguang Bao
Abstract: A distinguished feature of multi-species boson systems is the appearance of the odd channel, in which the coupled spin of two different bosons is given by an odd number. Through exact numerical solutions of the Schrödinger equation for a medium-body cold system containing two types of spin-1 atoms, the effect of the odd channel has been studied. It was found that, due to the odd channel, the terms in the Hamiltonian are no longer all commutable. Accordingly, the combined spin of a single species is no longer conserved. However, when the parameters of interactions lie in some specific and broad domains, instead of a set of good quantum numbers, the ground-state (g.s.) can be specified by a set of nearly good real numbers. Each of them is not exactly a number but a very narrow interval on the positive real axis. The widths of the intervals would tend to zero when the particle numbers tend to infinity. When the parameters vary, the nearly good numbers can jump suddenly from one narrow interval to another well-separated narrow interval. Since the results of this paper are extracted from the exact solution of a medium-body system and not from a many-body approach as usual, for general many-body systems with Hamiltonians containing non-commutable terms, it remains to be clarified whether specific domains exist in the parameter space in which a set of nearly good real numbers can be used to specify the eigenstates.

Title: Vacancy induced expansion of spin-liquid regime in J1-J2 Heisenberg model
Authors: Soumyaranjan Dash, Anish Koley, Sanjeev Kumar
Abstract: We study the model for spin-1/2 J1-J2 Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a square lattice in the presence of spin vacancies. In order to overcome the methodological challenges associated with analyzing models with magnetic frustration and inhomogeneities, we introduce a new semi-classical approach in which singlet dimers are treated as effective classical degrees of freedom. The energetic and entropic aspects of the dimer formation are included via a classical Monte Carlo scheme that allows for the dynamical conversion of spin pairs into dimers and vice versa. We show that our semi-classical approach recovers the qualitative physics of the J1-J2 model in the absence of vacancies. The vacancies lead to a broadening of the spin-liquid regime between the Néel and the stripe antiferromagnetic phases. This suggests a possible new route to discover spin-liquid ground states by tuning the J2/J1 ratio in doped square lattice antiferromagnets.

Title: Magnetically controlled double-twist director configuration of lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals in cylinders: Energetics, topological defects, and instability
Authors: Junghoon Lee, Joonwoo Jeong
Abstract: We study experimentally how the double-twist (DT) configuration of cylindrically confined lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs) responds to axial magnetic fields. Our director field model unveils the energetics behind the magnetic field-induced transition in the twist profile of the DT configuration. Additionally, we catalog three different types of topological defects -- residing between the DT domains of opposite handedness -- before and after the field application, and propose a new director field model for the defect with a ring disclination. Lastly, we report a symmetry-breaking instability occurring when the field strength exceeds a critical value, suggesting an eccentric DT director field model that reproduces a helix-like optical texture. Our systematic investigation not only enhances our understanding of LCLC energetics but also provides potential for precise control over DT configurations.

Title: Characterizing local Majorana properties using Andreev states
Authors: Miguel Alvarado, Alfredo Levy Yetati, Ramón Aguado, Rubén Seoane Souto
Abstract: We propose using Andreev bound states (ABS) as spectroscopic probes to characterize Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in quantum-dot based minimal Kitaev chains. Specifically, we show that tunneling conductance measurements with a superconducting probe hosting an ABS reveal four subgap peaks whose voltage positions and relative heights enable extraction of the MZM energy splitting and Bogoliubov-de Gennes coherence factors. This provides direct access to zero-splitting regimes and to the local Majorana polarization - a measure of the Majorana character. The method is compatible with existing experimental architectures and remains robust in extended chains.

Title: Perturbative Analysis of the Field-Free Josephson Diode Effect in a Multilayered Josephson Junction
Authors: Shin-ichi Hikino
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect (JDE) is a novel phenomenon in which a superconducting junction exhibits asymmetric Josephson currents with respect to the superconducting phase difference. In this study, we theoretically investigate how the interplay between a static exchange field and Rashba spin-orbit interaction (RSOI) influences the JDE. By employing the quasiclassical Green's function method and perturbative calculations, we derive analytical expressions for the Josephson current in a junction composed of a ferromagnetic layer and a normal metal with RSOI. Remarkably, the JDE is found to emerge even in the absence of any external magnetic field. In this regime, the Josephson current is exclusively carried by spin-triplet Cooper pairs, as spin-singlet components are strongly suppressed by the ferromagnet. Furthermore, our results show that the efficiency of the JDE can be enhanced by tuning the thickness of the normal metal and the strength of the RSOI. These findings offer valuable theoretical guidelines for the design of superconducting devices exhibiting nonreciprocal transport effects.

Title: Localized Edge States in Stacked Al/Ni Multilayers: Possible Evidence of Chiral Hinge Modes
Authors: M. Belogolovskii, I. P. Nevirkovets
Abstract: Here, we report experimental evidence suggesting the emergence of robust, possibly chiral, edge states in artificially engineered multilayers composed of alternating nanometer-thick layers of nonmagnetic aluminum (Al) and ferromagnetic nickel (Ni). Using phase-sensitive Josephson interferometry, we observed distinct SQUID-like oscillations (instead of the conventional Fraunhofer patterns) in the maximum supercurrent versus in-plane probing magnetic field patterns, which can be associated with one-dimensional current-carrying modes localized at the sample boundaries. These results were obtained for multilayers consisting of up to ten Al/Ni bilayers sandwiched between superconducting Nb electrodes to form Josephson junctions. The spatially confined flow of supercurrent suggests the possible presence of chiral Andreev edge states reminiscent of those found in higher-order topological insulators, despite the absence of strong spin-orbit coupling or intrinsic topological band structure. The discovery of edge-localized charge transport in structures made of materials without intrinsic topological order challenges the prevailing understanding of topological phenomena and highlights the possibility of developing topological metamaterials as a tunable platform for exploring nontrivial edge physics.

Title: Ultrafast transition from coherent to incoherent polariton nonlinearities in a hybrid 1L-WS2/plasmon structure
Authors: Daniel Timmer, Moritz Gittinger, Thomas Quenzel, Alisson R. Cadore, Barbara L.T. Rosa, Wenshan Li, Giancarlo Soavi, Daniel C. Lünemann, Sven Stephan, Lara Greten, Marten Richter, Andreas Knorr, Antonietta De Sio, Martin Silies, Giulio Cerullo, Andrea C. Ferrari, Christoph Lienau
Abstract: Exciton polaritons based on atomically thin semiconductors are essential building blocks of quantum optoelectronic devices. Their properties are governed by an ultrafast and oscillatory energy transfer between their excitonic and photonic constituents, resulting in the formation of polaritonic quasiparticles with pronounced nonlinearities induced by the excitonic component. In metallic nanoresonators, dissipation phenomena limit the polariton lifetime to a few ten femtoseconds, so short that the role of these polaritons for the nonlinearities of such hybrids is yet unexplored. Here, we use ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to uncover coherent polariton dynamics in a hybrid monolayer (1L) WS2/plasmonic nanostructure. With respect to an uncoupled WS2 flake, we observe an over 20-fold, polarization-dependent enhancement of the optical nonlinearity and a rapid evolution of the 2DES spectra within ~70 fs. We relate these dynamics to a transition from coherent polaritons to incoherent excitations, unravel the microscopic optical nonlinearities, and show the potential of coherent polaritons for ultrafast all-optical switching.

Title: High-fidelity modeling of interface crossing in the diffusion welding process at the polycrystalline scale
Authors: Camille Godinot, Emmanuel Rigal, Frédéric Bernard, Philippe Emonot, Pierre-Eric Frayssines, Luc Védie, Marc Bernacki
Abstract: Controlling the microstructure of a diffusion welded interface is a critical point to ensure optimum mechanical properties and the homogeneity of the joint. Beyond the intimate contact formation between bonded parts studied in the literature, this article focuses on the grain boundary crossing of the interface during this process and its measurement. Following this perspective, a Level-Set method has been used for full-field microstructure simulations in 2D with various interface parameters. Two crossing measurement models have been formulated, tested and discussed over the simulations.

Title: Pressure-Driven Moiré Potential Enhancement and Tertiary Gap Opening in Graphene/h-BN Heterostructure
Authors: Yupeng Wang, Jiaqi An, Chunhui Ye, Xiangqi Wang, Di Mai, Hongze Zhao, Yang Zhang, Chiyu Peng, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Xiaoyu Sun, Rucheng Dai, Zhongping Wang, Wei Qin, Zhenhua Qiao, Zengming Zhang
Abstract: Moiré superlattices enable engineering of correlated quantum states through tunable periodic potentials, where twist angle controls periodicity but dynamic potential strength modulation remains challenging. Here, we develop a high-pressure quantum transport technique for van der Waals heterostructures, achieving the ultimate pressure limit (~9 GPa) in encapsulated moiré devices. In aligned graphene/h-BN, we demonstrate that pressure induces a substantial enhancement of the moiré potential strength, evidenced by the suppression of the first valence bandwidth and the near-doubling of the primary band gap. Moreover, we report the first observation of a tertiary gap emerging above 6.4 GPa, verifying theoretical predictions. Our results establish hydrostatic pressure as a universal parameter to reshape moiré band structures. By enabling quantum transport studies at previously inaccessible pressure regimes, this Letter expands the accessible parameter space for exploring correlated phases in moiré systems.

Title: Differentiation of Site-Specific Symmetry Breaking Orders in Y$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+y}$
Authors: L. Martinelli, S. Rüdiger, I. Bialo, J. Oppliger, F. Igoa Saldana, M. v. Zimmermann, E. Weschke, R. Arpaia, J. Chang
Abstract: Solid matter is classified through symmetry of ordering phenomena. Experimentally, this approach is straightforward, except when distinct orderings occur with identical or almost identical symmetry breaking. Here we show that the cuprate system Y$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+y}$ hosts two distinct orderings with almost identical translational symmetry breaking. Only when applying site-sensitive resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS), charge ordering can be conclusively differentiated from a super-lattice structure. These two orderings occur with almost the same in-plane symmetry but manifest at different atomic sites and display different temperature dependence. Differentiating these orders provides an important clue to the anomalous behavior of PrBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ within the 123-series of high-temperature superconductors. We conclude that the symmetry breaking at the Pr-site is unfavorable for superconducting pairing.

Title: hBN alignment orientation controls moiré strength in rhombohedral graphene

Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene hosts a rich landscape of correlated symmetry-broken phases, driven by strong interactions from its flat band edges. Aligning to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) creates a moiré pattern, leading to recent observations of exotic ground states such as integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects. Here, we show that the moiré effects and resulting correlated phase diagrams are critically influenced by a previously underestimated structural choice: the hBN alignment orientation. This binary parameter distinguishes between configurations where the rhombohedral graphene and hBN lattices are aligned near 0° or 180°, a distinction that arises only because both materials break inversion symmetry. Although the two orientations produce the same moiré wavelength, we find their distinct local stacking configurations result in markedly different moiré potential strengths. Using low-temperature transport and scanning SQUID-on-tip magnetometry, we compare nearly identical devices that differ only in alignment orientation and observe sharply contrasting sequences of symmetry-broken states. Theoretical analysis reveals a simple mechanism based on lattice relaxation and the atomic-scale electronic structure of rhombohedral graphene, supported by detailed modeling. These findings establish hBN alignment orientation as a key control parameter in moiré-engineered graphene systems and provide a framework for interpreting both prior and future experiments.

Title: Tunneling Dynamics and Time Delay in Electron Transport through Time-Dependent Barriers with Finite-Bandwidth Reservoirs
Authors: Shmuel Gurvitz, Dmitri Sokolovski
Abstract: We present a transparent and analytically tractable approach to the problem of time-dependent electron transport through tunneling barriers. Using the Single-Electron Approach, we study a model system composed of a time-dependent tunneling barrier coupled to two reservoirs of finite bandwidth. Avoiding Floquet expansions, we derive simple expressions for the time-dependent tunneling current in both adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes. Our formulation, based on the tunneling Hamiltonian framework, relates barrier modulation to measurable phase shifts in the steady-state current, offering a physically intuitive definition of the tunneling (or traversal) time. Remarkably, in the Markovian limit (wide-band reservoirs), we recover the well-known result of vanishing tunneling time. In contrast, for finite-bandwidth leads, we predict a finite time delay given by the inverse bandwidth. Our findings provide a robust foundation for understanding tunneling dynamics in non-Markovian environments and may serve as a benchmark for experimental investigations involving tunable band structures.

Title: Towards trustworthy AI in materials mechanics through domain-guided attention
Authors: Jesco Talies, Eric Breitbarth, David Melching
Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness and robustness of deep learning models remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in high-stakes scientific applications. In this study, we present a framework called attention-guided training that combines explainable artificial intelligence techniques with quantitative evaluation and domain-specific priors to guide model attention. We demonstrate that domain specific feedback on model explanations during training can enhance the model's generalization capabilities. We validate our approach on the task of semantic crack tip segmentation in digital image correlation data which is a key application in the fracture mechanical characterization of materials. By aligning model attention with physically meaningful stress fields, such as those described by Williams' analytical solution, attention-guided training ensures that the model focuses on physically relevant regions. This finally leads to improved generalization and more faithful explanations.

Title: Configurational Entropy and Its Scaling Behavior in Lattice Systems with Number of States Defined by Coordination Numbers
Authors: Youshen Wu, Xin Guan, Shengli Zhang, Lei Zhang
Abstract: We introduce an exactly solvable lattice model that reveals a universal finite-size scaling law for configurational entropy driven purely by geometry. Using exact enumeration via Burnside's lemma, we compute the entropy for diverse 1D, 2D, and 3D lattices, finding that the deviation from the thermodynamic limit $s_{\infty} = \ln (z)$ scales as $\Delta s_{N} \sim N^{-1/d}$, with lattice-dependent higher-order corrections. This scaling, observed across structures from chains to FCC and diamond lattices, offers a minimal framework to quantify geometric influences on entropy. The model captures the order of magnitude of experimental residual entropies (e.g., $S_{\mathrm{molar}} = R \ln 12 \approx 20.7 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K}$) and provides a reference for understanding entropy-driven order in colloids, clusters, and solids.

Title: Thermodynamics of the hyperkagome-lattice $S=1/2$ Heisenberg ferromagnet
Authors: Maksym Parymuda, Taras Krokhmalskii, Oleg Derzhko
Abstract: The hyperkagome-lattice $S=1/2$ Heisenberg ferromagnet is studied by means of the linear spin-wave theory, the double-time temperature Green's function method, high-temperature expansions series analysis, and quantum Monte Carlo simulations to examine the effect of lattice geometry on the finite-temperature properties. In particular, we have found that the Curie temperature $T_c$ for the hyperkagome-lattice (frustrated lattice) ferromagnet is about $0.33\vert J\vert$ that is smaller than $T_c$ for the diamond-lattice (another three-dimensional lattice with the same coordination number 4 but bipartite one) ferromagnet by about $25\%$.

Title: Flat-band projected versus fully atomistic twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Miguel Sánchez Sánchez, Tobias Stauber
Abstract: We benchmark the recently proposed projection method [Phys. Rev. B 111, 205133 (2025)] for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) across various symmetry-breaking phases at charge neutrality. The flat-band projected solutions agree well with the full tight-binding, with band structures and total energies differing by only a few meV. The projection to the flat bands is justified, owing to the increased gap to the remote bands in the normal state. Moreover, we employ a novel set of order parameters that allow us to visualize the wave functions locally in real space and quantify the breaking of various symmetries in the correlated phases. These order parameters are suitable to characterize MATBG and generic honeycomb systems.

Authors: Wen-Xin Jiang, Zhen-Hao Gong, Yuantao Chen, Zhigang Gui, Li Huang
Abstract: Valley polarization and altermagnetism are two emerging fundamental phenomena in condensed matter physics, offering unprecedented opportunites for information encoding and processing in novel energy-efficient devices. By coupling valley and spin degrees of freedom with ferroic orders such as ferroelectricity, nonvolatile memory functionalities can be achieved. Here, we propose a way to realize ferroelectric-valley (FE-valley) and FE-altermagnetic coupling in a bilayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) honeycomb lattices based on an effective four-band spin-full $k\cdot p$ model. Our proposal is validated in bilayer MnPTe$_3$ through first-principles calculations. A spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization occurs in AB- (BA-) stacking configuration, which is reversibly switchable via interlayer sliding. Remarkably, polarization reversal simultaneously inverts both layer-resolved valley polarization and altermagnetic spin splitting. This dual control enables tunable layer-spin-locked anomalous valley Hall effects and an unprecedented magnetoelectric response in 2D antiferromagnets. Our work establishes a general paradigm for electrically programmable valleytronic and spintronic functionalities of 2D AFM materials.

Title: Dynamical phase transition in a strongly hybridized phonon-triplon chain
Authors: Mohsen Yarmohammadi
Abstract: We study a dimerized spin-1/2 chain, such as CuGeO$_3$, hosting triplon excitations coupled to optical phonons under weak terahertz laser driving. Both phonons and triplons weakly lose energy into the surrounding baths, forming a non-equilibrium steady state. In the strong phonon-triplon coupling regime, phonons near the two-triplon continuum hybridize strongly with triplons. Using mean-field Lindblad dynamics, we show that this strong hybridization induces sharp first-order phase transitions -- either single or simultaneous double -- in the emission spectrum, mainly due to dissipation-induced nonlinearities. Using mean-field Floquet analysis of harmonic modes in both sectors, we analytically confirm the existence of these phase transitions. Furthermore, we map the complete steady-state phase diagram by varying key control parameters and provide experimentally relevant parameters for observing these transitions in laser-driven CuGeO$_3$.

Title: Cascade of Even-Denominator Fractional Quantum Hall States in Mixed-Stacked Multilayer Graphene
Authors: Yating Sha, Kai Liu, Chenxin Jiang, Dan Ye, Shuhan Liu, Zhongxun Guo, Jingjing Gao, Ming Tian, Neng Wan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Bingbing Tong, Guangtong Liu, Li Lu, Yuanbo Zhang, Zhiwen Shi, Zixiang Hu, Guorui Chen
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), particularly at half-filling of Landau levels, provides a unique window into topological phases hosting non-Abelian excitations. However, experimental platforms simultaneously offering large energy gaps, delicate tunability, and robust non-Abelian signatures remain scarce. Here, we report the observation of a cascade of even-denominator FQH states at filling factors ${\nu}$ = ${-5/2}$, ${-7/2}$, ${-9/2}$, ${-11/2}$, and ${-13/2}$, alongside numerous odd-denominator states in mixed-stacked pentalayer graphene, a previously unexplored system characterized by intertwined quadratic and cubic band dispersions. These even-denominator states, representing the highest filling half-filled states reported so far in the zeroth Landau level (ZLL), emerge from two distinct intra-ZLL and exhibit unprecedented displacement field tunability driven by LL crossings in the hybridized multiband structure. At half fillings, continuous quasiparticle phase transitions between paired FQH states, magnetic Bloch states, and composite Fermi liquids are clearly identified upon tuning external fields. Numerical calculations, revealing characteristic sixfold ground-state degeneracy and chiral graviton spectral analysis, suggest the observed even-denominator FQH states belong to the non-Abelian Moore-Read type. These results establish mixed-stacked multilayer graphene as a rich and versatile crystalline platform for exploring tunable correlated topological phases.

Title: Measuring coherence factors of states in superconductors through local current
Authors: Rodrigo A. Dourado, Jeroen Danon, Martin Leijnse, Rubén Seoane Souto
Abstract: The coherence factors of quasiparticles in a superconductor determine their properties, including transport and susceptibility to electric fields. In this work, we propose a way to infer the local coherence factors using local transport to normal leads. Our method is based on measuring the local current through a lead as the coupling to a second one is varied: the shape of the current is determined by the ratio between the local coherence factors, becoming independent of the coupling to the second lead in the presence of local electron-hole symmetry, {\it i.e.} coherence factors $|u|=|v|$. We apply our method to minimal Kitaev chains: arrays of quantum dots coupled via narrow superconducting segments. These chains feature Majorana-like quasiparticles (zero-energy states with $|u|=|v|$) at discrete points in parameter space. We demonstrate that the local current allows us to estimate the local Majorana polarization (MP)--a measurement of the local Majorana properties of the state. We derive an analytical expression for the MP in terms of local currents and benchmark it against numerical calculations for 2- and 3-sites chains that include a finite Zeeman field and electron-electron interactions. These results provide a way to quantitatively assess the quality of Majorana states in short Kitaev chains.

Title: Dislocation Dynamics and Shape in High Entropy Alloys: the Influence of Stress Correlations, Long-Range Interactions and Anisotropy
Authors: Dénes Berta, Péter Dusán Ispánovity
Abstract: High entropy alloys gained significant scientific interest in recent years due to their enhanced mechanical properties including high yield strength combined with outstanding ductility. The strength of these materials originates from their highly heterogeneous pinning stress fields that hinder dislocation glide, that is, plastic deformation. This work investigates how the correlations and the anisotropy of the pinning stresses, and the long-range nature and the anisotropy of dislocation interactions influence the propagation of dislocations and the depinning transition in these alloys. Furthermore, it is studied how the impact of these factors manifest in the shape of dislocations. The implications to the wider scope of generic disordered systems and to possible experimental applications are also discussed.

Title: Light-induced Odd-parity Magnetism in Conventional Collinear Antiferromagnets
Authors: Shengpu Huang, Zheng Qin, Fangyang Zhan, Dong-Hui Xu, Da-Shuai, Rui Wang
Abstract: Recent studies have drawn growing attention on non-relativistic odd-parity magnetism in the wake of altermagnets. Nevertheless, odd-parity spin splitting is often believed to appear in non-collinear magnetic configurations. Here, using symmetry arguments and effective model analysis, we show that Floquet engineering offers a universal strategy for achieving odd-parity magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) collinear antiferromagnets under irradiation of periodic driving light fields such as circularly polarized light, elliptically polarized light, and bicircular light. A comprehensive classification of potential candidates for collinear monolayer or bilayer antiferromagnets is established. Strikingly, the light-induced odd-parity spin splitting can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the crystalline symmetry or the polarization state of incident light, enabling the reversal or conversion of spin-splitting. By combining first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we present illustrative examples of 2D collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials to verify the light-induced odd-parity magnetism. Our work not only offers a powerful approach for uniquely achieving odd-parity spin-splitting with high tunability, but also expands the potential of Floquet engineering in designing unconventional compensated magnetism.

Title: Theory of off-diagonal disorder in multilayer topological insulator
Authors: Z.Z. Alisultanov, A. Kudlis
Abstract: We study multilayer topological insulators with random interlayer tunnelling, known as off-diagonal disorder. Within the Burkov-Balents model a single Hermitian defect creates a bound state whose energy crosses the middle of the gap in the trivial phase but never in the topological phase; a non-Hermitian defect splits this level yet preserves the same crossing rule, so the effect serves as a local marker of topology. However, the key distinction persists: the bound state crosses zero in the trivial phase but not in the topological phase. Two complementary diagrammatic approaches give matching densities of states for the normal, topological, Weyl and anomalous quantum Hall regimes. Off diagonal disorder inserts bulk states into the gap and can close it: the Weyl phase remains robust under strong disorder, whereas the anomalous quantum Hall phase survives only for weak fluctuations, and the added bulk states shrink the Hall plateau, clarifying experimental deviations. Finally, we analyse edge modes. Uniform disorder shortens their localization length slightly, while Gaussian and Lorentzian disorder enlarge it and in the Gaussian case can even delocalize the edges. Although chirality is maintained, the enhanced overlap permits tunnelling between opposite edges and pulls the longitudinal conductance away from its quantized value.

Title: Electric-field control of two-dimensional ferromagnetic properties by chiral ionic gating
Authors: Hideki Matsuoka, Amaki Moriyama, Tomohiro Hori, Yoshinori Tokura, Yoshihiro Iwasa, Shu Seki, Masayuki Suda, Naoya Kanazawa
Abstract: Chiral molecular systems offer unique pathways to control spin and magnetism beyond conventional symmetry operations. Here, we demonstrate that chiral ionic liquids enable electric-field modulation of two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism in FeSi(111) thin films via electric double-layer transistor (EDLT) gating. FeSi hosts chemically-stable, surface-confined ferromagnetism without bulk moments, making the interfacial spins highly responsive to chiral-ion adsorption. Using both achiral and chiral ionic liquids, we systematically compare electrochemical and electrostatic gating effects. While both gating modes modulate magnetic properties such as anomalous Hall conductivity and coercive field, only chiral ionic gating biases the ratio of up- and down-magnetized domains in a handedness-dependent manner, evidencing chirality-induced symmetry breaking. This work establishes chiral ion gating as a novel strategy for controlling magnetic order and opens new directions for chiral spintronics.

Title: Chemical capacitor: its concept, functionalities and limits
Authors: Łukasz Wolański, Dawid Ciszewski, Piotr Szkudlarek, José Lorenzana, Wojciech Grochala
Abstract: We use density functional theory calculations to study simple but diverse stoichiometries within the novel chemical capacitor (CC) setup. We look at main effects occurring in this device, extremes of the physicochemical properties, and we study limits of applicability of this nano-object. In the cases studied, CC permits achieving charge transfer of up to 1.74 e per atom. Tuning of the charge transfer may be achieved via judicious choice of chemical constituents of the CC as well as use of a ferroelectric material as a separator layer. Different classes of chemical systems may be doped, including metallic and nonmetallic elements, and chemical compounds, in certain cases leading to the appearance of superconductivity.

Title: Crystalline electric field and large anomalous Hall effect in the candidate topological material CeGaSi
Authors: Rajesh Swami, Daloo Ram, Anusree C.V, V. Kanchana, Z. Hossain
Abstract: We report a comprehensive investigation of CeGaSi single crystals, including magnetic, thermodynamic, electronic, and magnetotransport properties. The powder x-ray diffraction refinement revealed that CeGaSi crystallizes in LaPtSi-type tetragonal structure with space group I41md. The electrical resistivity data show a metallic nature with a sharp drop occurring around T_m = 11 K, revealing a magnetic phase transition, which is confirmed by magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity data. The magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and heat capacity data are analyzed through the crystalline electric field based on point charge model, suggesting that the six degenerate ground states of Ce3+ (J = 5/2) ion split into three doublets with an overall splitting energy = 288 K. The maximum negative magnetoresistance in CeGaSi for both B\parallel c and B\parallel ab field-direction is observed near T_m, it is attributed to the suppression of spin-disorder scattering by the magnetic field. The Hall resistivity data for B \parallel c and B\parallel ab show anomalous Hall signal. Our scaling analysis suggests that anomalous Hall effect in CeGaSi is dominated by the skew scattering mechanism. In addition, first-principles calculations identify CeGaSi as a nodal-line metal.

Title: Physical Constraints on the Rhythmicity of the Biological Clock
Authors: YeongKyu Lee, Changbong Hyeon
Abstract: Circadian rhythms in living organisms are temporal orders emerging from biochemical circuits driven out of equilibrium. Here, we study how the rhythmicity of a biochemical clock is shaped using the KaiABC system. A phase diagram constructed as a function of KaiC and KaiA concentrations reveals a sharply bounded limit-cycle region, which naturally explains arrhythmia upon protein over-expression. Beyond the Hopf bifurcation, intrinsic noise enables regular oscillation via coherence resonance. Within the limit-cycle region, greater rhythmic precision incurs a higher energetic cost, following the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The cost-minimizing period of the KaiABC clock ($\sim$21-hr) is close enough to entrain to 24-hr cycle of environment. Our study substantiates universal physical constraints on the robustness, precision, and efficiency of noisy biological clocks.

Title: Near-field focusing and amplification of tip-substrate radiative heat transfer
Authors: Milo Vescovo, Philippe Ben-Abdallah, Riccardo Messina
Abstract: The spatially resolved near-field radiative heat transfer between a nanoscale probe and a substrate is studied in the fluctuational electrodynamics framework within the dipolar approximation. It is shown that the introduction of a thin polar film atop a non-dispersive substrate can lead to both an enhancement and a lateral focusing of the heat exchange. The influence of the probe--substrate separation, film thickness and substrate permittivity is analyzed, revealing that the effect originates from near-field interactions governed by the interplay between film-induced modifications of electromagnetic mode dispersion and the distance-dependent coupling strength. The results highlight a viable route toward the active control of local radiative heat transfer at the nanoscale.

Title: Nonequilibrium transport through an interacting monitored quantum dot
Authors: Daniel Werner, Matthieu Vanhoecke, Marco Schirò, Enrico Arrigoni
Abstract: We study the interplay between strong correlations and Markovian dephasing, resulting from monitoring the charge or spin degrees of freedom of a quantum dot described by a dissipative Anderson impurity model. Using the Auxiliary master equation approach we compute the steady-state spectral function and occupation of the dot and discuss the role of dephasing on Kondo physics. Furthermore, we consider a two-lead setup which allows to compute the steady-state current and conductance. We show that the Kondo steady-state is robust to moderate charge dephasing but not to spin dephasing, which we interpret in terms of dephasing-induced heating of low-energy excitations. Finally, we show universal scaling collapse of the non-linear conductance with a dephasing-dependent Kondo scale.

Title: Three-boson scattering hypervolume for a nonzero orbital angular momentum
Authors: Pui In Ip, Shina Tan
Abstract: We analyze the zero energy collision of three identical bosons in the same internal state with total orbital angular momentum $L=2$, assuming short range interactions. By solving the Schrödinger equation asymptotically, we derive two expansions of the wave function when three bosons are far apart or a pair of bosons and the third boson are far apart. The scattering hypervolume $D$ is defined for this collision. Unlike the scattering hypervolume defined by one of us in 2008, whose dimension is length to the fourth power, the dimension of $D$ studied in the present paper is length to the eighth power. We then derive the expression of $D$ when the interaction potentials are weak, using the Born's expansion. We also calculate the energy shift of such three bosons with three different momenta $\hbar \mathbf{k_{1}}$, $\hbar\mathbf{k_{2}}$ and $\hbar\mathbf{k_{3}}$ in a large periodic box. The obtained energy shift depends on $D^{(0)}/\Omega^{2}$ and $D/\Omega^{2}$, where $D^{(0)}$ is the three-body scattering hypervolume defined for the three-body $L=0$ collision and $\Omega$ is the volume of the periodic box. We also calculate the contribution of $D$ to the three-body T-matrix element for low-energy collisions. We then calculate the shift of the energy and the three-body recombination rate due to $D^{(0)}$ and $D$ in the dilute homogeneous Bose gas. The contribution to the three-body recombination rate constant from $D$ is proportional to $T^2$ if the temperature $T$ is much larger than the quantum degeneracy temperature but still much lower than the temperature scale at which the thermal de Broglie wave length becomes comparable to the physical range of interaction.

Title: First principles study of [111]-oriented epitaxially strained Rare-Earth Nickelate NdNiO$_3$
Authors: Alexander Lione, Jorge Íñiguez-González, Nicholas C. Bristowe
Abstract: Density functional theory is used to investigate the effect of biaxial strain on the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of [111]-oriented NdNiO$_3$, as a representative of the rare-earth perovskites that undergo metal-to-insulator transitions. We find that this constraint on the system induces unique structural phase transitions not previously observed under the well-studied bulk or [001]-oriented strained systems. We also report unique electronic behaviour, including amplification of the electronic band-gap with tensile strain, and insulating, charge-ordered phases with non-orthorhombic tilt patterns. To provide clarity to the trends we observe, we also investigate the coupling between the breathing mode and strain, where we observe certain strains to directly favour and disfavour the creation of the breathing mode (and thus the associated charge-ordering). The amplification of the band gap with strain is understood in terms of a cooperative coupling between the elastic constraint and octahedral breathing, which expands on the previously reported triggered mechanism mediated by octahedral tilting.

Title: Defect migration in supercrystalline nanocomposites

Keller, Gerold A. Schneider, Gregor B. Vonbun-Feldbauer, Robert H. Meissner, Andreas Stierle, Ivan A. Vartanyants, Diletta Giuntini
Abstract: Supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) are nanostructured hybrid materials with unique emergent functional properties. Given their periodically arranged building blocks, they also offer interesting parallelisms with crystalline materials. They can be processed in multiple forms and at different scales, and crosslinking their organic ligands via heat treatment leads to a remarkable boost of their mechanical properties. This study shows, via X-ray and in-situ scanning transmission (STEM) electron microscopy analyses, how each of these processing steps plays a distinct role in the generation, migration, interaction and healing of supercrystalline defects. Pressing of SCNCs into bulk pellets leads to a distortion of the otherwise fcc superlattice, while emulsion-templated self-assembly yields supraparticles (SPs) with stacking faults and size-dependent symmetries. Interestingly, heat treatment at the same temperatures as those applied for the organic crosslinking has significant effects on planar defects. Stacking faults migrate and get healed, as also confirmed via molecular dynamics simulations, and inter-supercrystalline 'grain' boundaries undergo structural changes. These rearrangements of defects at the supercrystalline scale (tens of nm) in nanocomposites with such remarkable mechanical properties (compressive strength of 100-500 MPa) provide new insights into the formation and evolution of ordered assemblies of functionalized nanoparticles.

Title: When does hyperuniformity lead to uniformity across length scales?
Authors: Carlo Vanoni, Paul J. Steinhardt, Salvatore Torquato
Abstract: Hyperuniform systems are distinguished by an unusually strong suppression of large-scale density fluctuations and, consequently, display a high degree of uniformity at the largest length scales. In some cases, however, enhanced uniformity is expected to be present even at intermediate and possibly small length scales. There exist three different classes of hyperuniform systems, where class I and class III are the strongest and weakest forms, respectively. We utilize the local number variance $\sigma_N^2(R)$ associated with a window of radius $R$ as a diagnostic to quantify the approach to the asymptotic large-$R$ hyperuniform scaling of a variety of class I, II, and III systems. We find, for all class I systems we analyzed, including crystals, quasicrystals, disordered stealthy hyperuniform systems, and the one-component plasma, a faster approach to the asymptotic scaling of $\sigma_N^2(R)$, governed by corrections with integer powers of $1/R$. Thus, we conclude this represents the highest degree of effective uniformity from small to large length scales. Class II systems, such as Fermi-sphere point processes, are characterized by logarithmic $1/\ln(R)$ corrections and, consequently, a lower degree of local uniformity. Class III systems, such as perturbed lattice patterns, present an asymptotic scaling of $1/R^{\alpha}$, $0 < \alpha < 1$, implying, curiously, an intermediate degree of local uniformity. In addition, our study provides insight into when experimental and numerical finite systems are representative of large-scale behavior. Our findings may thereby facilitate the design of hyperuniform systems with enhanced physical properties arising from local uniformity.

Title: Anomalous Scaling Behaviors of the Green's Function in Critical Skin Effects
Authors: Yifei Yi, Zhesen Yang
Abstract: We study the Green's functions in non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the critical non-Hermitian skin effect (critical NHSE) using a double-chain Hatano-Nelson model with inter-chain coupling $\Delta$. For $\Delta=0$, the system decouples into two independent chains, and the Green's functions follow predictable patterns based on the GBZ theory. For small $\Delta$ ($\Delta=1/10000$), in conventional regions with trivial OBC spectral winding numbers, inter-chain coupling induces a zigzag scaling structure in Green's functions due to competition between the two chains, explainable by first-order perturbation theory. In anomalous regions with non-trivial winding numbers, Green's functions match GBZ predictions in the bulk but diverge near boundaries, with residual contributions from the $\Delta=0$ GBZ accounting for the deviations. These results reveal the unique non-perturbative features of critical NHSE and highlight the limitations of GBZ theory in capturing finite-size and boundary effects, emphasizing the need to consider both bulk and boundary dynamics in such systems.

Title: Active Learning for Predicting the Enthalpy of Mixing inBinary Liquids Based on Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Quentin Bizot, Ryo Tamura, Guillaume Deffrennes
Abstract: The enthalpy of mixing in the liquid phase is an important property for predicting phase formation in alloys. It can be estimated in a large compositional space from pair wise interactions between elements, for which machine learning has recently provided the most accurate predictions. Further improvements requires acquiring high quality data in liquids where models are poorly constrained. In this study, we propose an active learning approach to identify in which liquids additional data are most needed to improve an initial dataset that covers over 400 binary liquids. We identify a critical need for new data on liquids containing refractory elements, which we address by performing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for 29 equimolar alloys of Ir, Os, Re and W. This enables more accurate predictions of the enthalpy of mixing, and we discuss the trends obtained for refractory elements of period 6. We use clustering analysis to interpret the results of active learning and to explore how our features can be linked to Miedema's semi empirical theory.

Title: Nonequilibrium fluctuations in a harmonic trap with annealed stochastic stiffness
Authors: Deepak Gupta, Sabine H. L. Klapp
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of the positional dynamics and average thermodynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle subject to both, harmonic confinement and annealed disorder due to a temporarily fluctuating trap stiffness. We model this stiffness via a stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process whose correlation time can be tuned from white noise to a quenched limit. We analytically calculate the positional distribution in these limits and provide exact expressions for the $n$th positional moments at finite correlation times, revealing important insights regarding stationarity. Further, we analyze the average work performed on the particle and the heat dissipated into the environment at all times, illustrating the nonequilibrium character of the system and its relaxation into a steady state. Our analytical results are validated by numerical Langevin simulations.

Title: Influence of Dispersity on the Relaxation of Entangled Polymers from Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Taofeek Tejuosho, Janani Sampath
Abstract: Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the deformation behavior of disperse polymer melts by tracking test chains of length N = Mw, the weight average molecular weight, in melts of varying dispersity. At high strain rates, stress decreases with increasing dispersity up to the critical stretch ratio. After flow cessation, relaxation is anisotropic: the parallel component of the radius of gyration decreases monotonically with dispersity, but the perpendicular component exhibits non-monotonic behavior, with fast relaxation at low to intermediate stretching ratios, and slower relaxation at higher stretching ratios as dispersity increases. Single-chain structure factor shows a similar trend in the perpendicular direction, with fast relaxation at intermediate length scales in disperse systems, while the parallel component remains unaffected by dispersity. These findings reveal the complex, dispersity-dependent anisotropic relaxation mechanisms in moderately entangled polymer melts far from equilibrium.

Title: Collective filament wrapping and nested spiral formation in active polydisperse systems
Authors: Caterina Landi, Giulia Janzen, Francesco Sciortino, John Russo, Chantal Valeriani, Daniel A. Matoz-Fernandez
Abstract: We investigate a two-dimensional polydisperse suspension of self-propelled semiflexible filaments and reveal a collective wrapping mechanism that is absent in monodisperse systems. At intermediate activity levels, long filaments coil around shorter ones, forming nested spiral structures stabilized by filament length disparity. These assemblies generalize the single-filament spiraling seen in active systems into cooperative, multi-filament configurations. As activity increases, the nested spirals undergo structural transitions: medium-length filaments unwind, longer filaments encapsulate shorter ones, and eventually all spiral structures dissolve. This reorganization is reflected in the dynamics, where van Hove distributions uncover coexisting confined and motile filament populations. Our findings identify filament length as a key control parameter for nonequilibrium self-assembly and establish inter-filament wrapping as a minimal mechanism for hierarchical organization in active matter. This mechanism provides a simple model for the cooperative confinement and structural hierarchy observed in both biological and synthetic active systems.

Title: Anomalous fluctuations of Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices
Authors: Zahra Jalali-Mola, Niklas Käming, Luca Asteria, Utso Bhattacharya, Ravindra W. Chhajlany, Klaus Sengstock, Maciej Lewenstein, Tobias Grass, Christof Weitenberg
Abstract: Fluctuations are fundamental in physics and important for understanding and characterizing phase transitions. In this spirit, the phase transition to the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is of specific importance. Whereas fluctuations of the condensate particle number in atomic BECs have been studied in continuous systems, experimental and theoretical studies for lattice systems were so far missing. Here, we explore the condensate particle number fluctuations in an optical lattice BEC across the phase transition in a combined experimental and theoretical study. We present both experimental data using ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms and numerical simulations based on a hybrid approach combining the Bogoliubov quasiparticle framework with a master equation analysis for modeling the system. We find strongly anomalous fluctuations, where the variance of the condensate number $\delta N_{\rm BEC}^2$ scales with the total atom number as $N^{1+\gamma}$ with an exponent around $\gamma_{\rm theo}=0.74$ and $\gamma_{\rm exp}=0.62$, which we attribute to the 2D/3D crossover geometry and the interactions. Our study highlights the importance of the trap geometry on the character of fluctuations and on fundamental quantum mechanical properties.

Title: Spectral distribution of sparse Gaussian Ensembles of Real Asymmetric Matrices
Authors: Ratul Dutta, Pragya Shukla
Abstract: Theoretical analysis of biological and artificial neural networks e.g. modelling of synaptic or weight matrices necessitate consideration of the generic real-asymmetric matrix ensembles, those with varying order of matrix elements e.g. a sparse structure or a banded structure. We pursue the complexity parameter approach to analyze the spectral statistics of the multiparametric Gaussian ensembles of real asymmetric matrices and derive the ensemble averaged spectral densities for real as well as complex eigenvalues. Considerations of the matrix elements with arbitrary choice of mean and variances render us the freedom to model the desired sparsity in the ensemble. Our formulation provides a common mathematical formulation of the spectral statistics for a wide range of sparse real-asymmetric ensembles and also reveals, thereby, a deep rooted universality among them.

Title: Superconducting density of states of PtPb4
Authors: Pablo García Talavera, Jose Antonio Moreno, Edwin Herrera, Alexander I. Buzdin, Sergey L. Bud'ko, Paul C. Canfield, Isabel Guillamón, Hermann Suderow
Abstract: PtPb$_4$ is a type II superconductor with a bulk critical temperature $T_{c}\approx 3 $K and an upper critical field of $H_{c2}=0.36 $T. PtPb$_4$ is related to non-superconducting PtSn$_4$, which presents nodal arc states at the surface. Here we measure the superconducting density of states of PtPb$_4$ using millikelvin Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). We observe a fully opened superconducting gap of $\Delta=0.48$\ meV similar to expectations from Bardeen Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS) theory ($\Delta_0=1.76k_BT_{c}=0.49 $meV). Measurements under magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the surface show a spatially inhomogeneous gap structure, presenting superconducting signatures at fields as high as 1.5 T, significantly above $H_{c2}=0.36 $T. On some locations we find that the superconducting density of states does not vanish above $T_{c}$. We can find signatures of a superconducting gap up to 5K. We discuss possible reasons for the observation of superconducting properties above $T_{c}$ and $H_{c2}$, emphasizing the role played by structural defects.

Title: Dynamics of Irreversible Particle Adsorption to Fluid Interfaces
Authors: Marina Pasquet, Yu Fu, Joelle Frechette
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic adsorption of colloidal particles at fluid interfaces is essential for applications ranging from emulsion stabilization to interfacial assembly of functional materials. Adsorption dynamics is often described through diffusion-limited models (such as the Ward-Tordai framework) along with assuming dynamic equilibrium between the adsorbed and dispersed particles. However, most experiments show that particle adsorption is irreversible, and diffusion-limited models fail as the surface coverage goes beyond the dilute limit where particle crowding limits further adsorption. Here, we present a unified model that captures the transition from diffusion-limited to kinetic-limited regimes by coupling diffusion with a Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA)-based boundary condition that accounts for irreversible adsorption and particle blocking for a spherical droplet. Using both a microtensiometer and pendant drop tensiometry, we measure dynamic interfacial tension changes for 3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TPM) particles at the toluene/water interface across a range of bulk concentrations, drop sizes, and particle functionalization. Our analysis shows that the adsorption flux becomes increasingly hindered as the surface area fills, in agreement with RSA predictions. Furthermore, we calculate the Thiele modulus as a dimensionless number that quantifies the relative importance of adsorption kinetics to diffusion. We find that above a critical surface coverage, adsorption becomes reaction-limited, marking a transition to kinetically controlled dynamics. This approach provides a predictive framework for particle adsorption at fluid interfaces and highlights the necessity of moving beyond equilibrium diffusion-limited models.

Title: Approximate solutions to the shrinking core model
Authors: Cristian Moreno Pulido, Rachael Olwande, Tim Myers, Francesc Font
Abstract: The shrinking core model describes the reaction of a spherical solid particle with a surrounding fluid. In this work, we revisit the SCM by deriving it from the underlying physical processes and performing a careful non-dimensionalisation, which highlights the limitations of the commonly used pseudo-steady-state approximation, particularly in liquid-solid systems where fluid and solid densities are comparable. To address these limitations, we derive approximate analytical solutions using a perturbation method that improves upon the pseudo-steady-state model. We also obtain a small-time solution capturing early transient behavior. A semi-implicit finite difference scheme is implemented to solve the full model numerically and benchmark the analytical approximations. We demonstrate that the perturbation solution provides significantly improved accuracy over the pseudo-steady-state model, especially in diffusion-limited regimes. Finally, we propose a simple fitting procedure combining the perturbation with the early-time solutions to estimate physical parameters from experimental data at minimal computational cost.

Title: Topological chiral superconductivity from antiferromagnetic correlations in moiré bands with extreme spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Chenyuan Li, Fang Xie, Jennifer Cano, Qimiao Si
Abstract: Motivated by the strong-correlation phenomenology observed near the superconducting phase in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we study multi-orbital $t$-$J$ models that are derived from different parameter regimes. The models contain effective antiferromagnetic interactions that are influenced by the strong underlying spin-orbit coupling. The possible superconducting pairing states are investigated in these models. We find that the preferred pairing order parameters are associated with the $^{1,2}E$ representations of the three-fold rotation symmetry operator $C_3$, with the $p\pm i p$ component intermixing with the $d\pm id$ component. The chiral superconducting states are shown to be topological, based on the Wilson loops of the corresponding Bogoliubov quasiparticles. We discuss the implications of our findings for experimental observations, as well as the new connections our results uncover between the moiré superconductivity and its counterpart in bulk quantum materials.

Title: Emergence of a Boundary-Sensitive Phase in Hyperbolic Ising Models
Authors: Xingzhi Wang, Zohar Nussinov, Gerardo Ortiz
Abstract: Physical systems defined on hyperbolic lattices may exhibit phases of matter that only emerge due to negative curvature. We focus on the case of the Ising model under open boundary conditions and show that an ``intermediate'' phase emerges in addition to standard (high-temperature) paramagnetic and (low-temperature) ferromagnetic phases. When performing the Kramers-Wannier duality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a finite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to characterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary conditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by boundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking. By developing a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide numerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their corresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete phase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous) intermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate transition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation.

Title: SPLENDOR: a novel detector platform to search for light dark matter with narrow-gap semiconductors

Abstract: We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results. Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR provides a novel approach to dark matter detection, combining quantum sensing with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass range of dark matter parameter space.

Title: MatSSL: Robust Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Metallographic Image Segmentation
Authors: Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen, Phan Nguyen Duc Hieu, Ho Won Lee
Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data, most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective. MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40% improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

Title: Graph Learning Metallic Glass Discovery from Wikipedia
Authors: K.-C. Ouyang, S.-Y. Zhang, S.-L. Liu, J. Tian, Y.-H. Li, H. Tong, H.-Y. Bai, W.-H. Wang, Y.-C. Hu
Abstract: Synthesizing new materials efficiently is highly demanded in various research fields. However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960. Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design. Our study proposes a new paradigm to harvesting new amorphous materials and beyond with artificial intelligence.

Title: Bayesian symbolic regression: Automated equation discovery from a physicists' perspective
Authors: Roger Guimera, Marta Sales-Pardo
Abstract: Symbolic regression automates the process of learning closed-form mathematical models from data. Standard approaches to symbolic regression, as well as newer deep learning approaches, rely on heuristic model selection criteria, heuristic regularization, and heuristic exploration of model space. Here, we discuss the probabilistic approach to symbolic regression, an alternative to such heuristic approaches with direct connections to information theory and statistical physics. We show how the probabilistic approach establishes model plausibility from basic considerations and explicit approximations, and how it provides guarantees of performance that heuristic approaches lack. We also discuss how the probabilistic approach compels us to consider model ensembles, as opposed to single models.

Title: The joint probability distribution function of global interaction complex systems
Authors: Jiaqi Zheng, Zhifu Huang
Abstract: Based on the relationship that the interaction energy between any two subsystems is equal to their internal energy multiplied by the interaction coefficient, we have derived a series correlated expressions of statistical physical quantities, such as the interactional average energy, the probability distribution function of internal energy, and so on. It should be noted that the probability distribution function we obtained is existing in many complex systems involving long-range interactions. Further, based on the zeroth law of thermodynamics, we have also obtained the joint probability distribution function of two coupled complex systems. It must be note that the joint probability distribution function we obtained no longer satisfies the common independent multiplication relationship in the previous researches. Finally, we selected several representative foreign exchange high-frequency trading data for verification and found that the theory is consistent with the reality.

Title: Exponentially robust non-Clifford gate in a driven-dissipative circuit
Authors: Liam O'Brien, Gil Refael, Frederik Nathan
Abstract: Recent work (Nathan et al, arXiv:2405.05671) proposed an architecture for a dissipatively stabilized GKP qubit, and protocols for protected Clifford gates. Here we propose a protocol for a protected non-Clifford $\sqrt{T}$ gate at the physical qubit level, based on the inclusion of a quartic flux potential generated by ancillary Josephson junctions. We show that such a gate is topologically robust with exponentially suppressed infidelity from control or device imperfections, and operates on microsecond timescales for GHz resonators. We analyze the resilience of the protocol to noise, imperfect control, and imperfect targeting of circuit parameters.

Title: Universal Relation Between Quantum Entanglement and Particle Transport
Authors: Elvira Bilokon, Valeriia Bilokon, Abhijit Sen, Mohammed Th. Hassan, Andrii Sotnikov, Denys I. Bondar
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum correlations and a key resource underpinning advances in quantum information and many-body physics. We uncover a universal relationship between bipartite entanglement entropy and particle number after the barrier in a one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard system with an external asymmetric potential. Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks - a novel machine learning architecture - we learn this relationship across a broad range of interaction strengths with near-perfect predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a simple analytical binary-entropy-like expression that quantitatively captures the observed correlation for fixed parameters. Our findings open new avenues for characterizing quantum correlations in transport phenomena and provide a powerful framework for predicting entanglement evolution in quantum systems.

Title: Dielectric environment engineering via 2D material heterostructure formation on hybrid photonic crystal nanocavity
Authors: C. F. Fong, D. Yamashita, N. Fang, Y.-R. Chang, S. Fujii, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, Y. K. Kato
Abstract: Hybrid integration of two-dimensional (2D) materials with nanophotonic platforms has enabled compact optoelectronic devices by leveraging the unique optical and electronic properties of atomically thin layers. While most efforts have focused on coupling 2D materials to pre-defined photonic structures, the broader potential of 2D heterostructures for actively engineering the photonic environment remains largely unexplored. In our previous work, we employed single types of 2D material and showed that even monolayer flakes can locally induce high-$Q$ nanocavities in photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides through effective refractive index modulation. Here, we extend this concept by demonstrating that further transferring of 2D material flakes onto the induced hybrid nanocavity to form heterostructures enable more flexibility for post-fabrication dielectric environment engineering of the cavity. We show that the high-$Q$ hybrid nanocavities remain robust under sequential flake stacking. Coupling optically active MoTe$_{2}$ flake to these cavities yields enhanced photoluminescence and reduced emission lifetimes, consistent with Purcell-enhanced light-matter interactions. Additionally, encapsulation with a top hBN layer leads to a significant increase in the cavity $Q$ factor, in agreement with numerical simulations. Our results show that these heterostructure stacks not only preserve the cavity quality but also introduce an additional degrees of control -- via flake thickness, refractive indices, size and interface design -- offering a richer dielectric environment modulation landscape than what is achievable with monolayers alone, providing a versatile method toward scalable and reconfigurable hybrid nanophotonic systems.

Title: A unified diagrammatic formulation of single-reference and multi-reference random phase approximations: the particle-hole and particle-particle channels
Authors: Yuqi Wang, Wei-Hai Fang, Zhendong Li
Abstract: A diagrammatic multi-reference generalization of many-body perturbation theory was recently introduced [J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2025, 16, 3047]. This framework allows us to extend single-reference (SR) Green's function methods defined at the diagrammatic level naturally into multi-reference case, as previously exemplified by the formulation of multi-reference direct random phase approximation (MR-dRPA) and the multi-reference second-order screened exchange approximation (MR-SOSEX). In this work, we further elaborate this framework and use it to develop MR generalizations of two other RPA variants, namely, particle-hole (ph) RPA with exchange (MR-RPAx) and particle-particle RPA (MR-ppRPA). We define these two MR generalizations by infinite order resummations of the generalized `ring' and `ladder' diagrams with antisymmetrized interaction vertices, respectively, which incorporate the contributions from the active-space connected two-body Green's functions. As for MR-dRPA, we derive unified sets of equations that hold at both SR and MR levels for RPAx and ppRPA, respectively. We perform numerical studies of prototypical systems using the three MR-RPA methods and carry out a perturbative analysis to gain a deeper understanding of their behaviors. We find that error cancellation between the second and third orders is a key factor for both SR-RPA and MR-RPA. In addition, we observe that MR-phRPA (MR-dRPA and MR-RPAx) and MR-ppRPA tend to overestimate and underestimate correlation energies, respectively, suggesting that a better accuracy can be achieved by further combining these two channels in the future.

Title: Spontaneous Space-Time Parity Breaking Without Thermal Restoration
Authors: Bilal Hawashin, Michael M. Scherer, Michael Smolkin, Lev Yung
Abstract: We construct an ultraviolet-complete, local, and unitary quantum field theory in 2+1 dimensions that exhibits spontaneous breaking of space-time parity, persisting to arbitrarily high temperatures. The theory is defined by a renormalization group trajectory, triggered by a relevant deformation of a conformal field theory, consisting of a critical biconical vector model and a free massless Dirac fermion. This deformation couples the fermion to the scalar sector, generating a renormalization group flow that terminates at a nontrivial infrared fixed point described by a conformal Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model and a decoupled critical vector model. By construction, the quantum field theory is parity invariant at zero temperature. However, we show that at sufficiently high temperatures, parity symmetry is spontaneously broken and remains so even in the infinite-temperature limit. Our analysis relies on both, perturbative renormalization group techniques in $4\!-\!\epsilon$ dimensions and functional renormalization group techniques directly in 2+1 dimensions.

Title: Equivariant Parameter Families of Spin Chains: A Discrete MPS Formulation
Authors: Ken Shiozaki
Abstract: We analyze topological phase transitions and higher Berry curvature in one-dimensional quantum spin systems, using a framework that explicitly incorporates the symmetry group action on the parameter space. Based on a $G$-compatible discretization of the parameter space, we incorporate both group cochains and parameter-space differentials, enabling the systematic construction of equivariant topological invariants. We derive a fixed-point formula for the higher Berry invariant in the case where the symmetry action has isolated fixed points. This reveals that the phase transition point between Haldane and trivial phases acts as a monopole-like defect where higher Berry curvature emanates. We further discuss hierarchical structures of topological defects in the parameter space, governed by symmetry reductions and compatibility with subgroup structures.

Title: Thermodynamic stability of superflows in General Relativity and Newtonian gravity
Authors: Lorenzo Gavassino
Abstract: Landau's criterion for superfluidity is a special case of a broader principle: A moving fluid cannot be stopped by frictional forces if its state of motion is a local minimum of the grand potential. We employ this general thermodynamic criterion to derive a set of inequalities that any superfluid mixture (with an arbitrary number of order parameters) must satisfy for a certain state of motion to be long-lived and unimpeded by friction. These macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids. Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid description. However, they do provide sufficient conditions for stability against stochastic hydrodynamic fluctuations. We first formulate our analysis within the framework of General Relativity, and then we take the Newtonian limit.

Title: Finite-Size Effects in Quantum Metrology at Strong Coupling: Microscopic vs Phenomenological Approaches
Authors: Ali Pedram, Özgür E. Müstecaplıoğlu
Abstract: We study the ultimate precision limits of a spin chain, strongly coupled to a heat bath, for measuring a general parameter and report the results for specific cases of magnetometry and thermometry. Employing a full polaron transform, we derive the effective Hamiltonian and obtain analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of equilibrium states in both weak coupling (WC) and strong coupling (SC) regimes for a general parameter, explicitly accounting for finite-size (FS) effects. Furthermore, we utilize Hill's nanothermodynamics to calculate an effective QFI expression at SC. Our results reveal a potential advantage of SC for thermometry at low temperatures and demonstrate enhanced magnetometric precision through control of the anisotropy parameter. Crucially, we show that neglecting FS effects leads to considerable errors in ultimate precision bounds for equilibrium thermometry. This work also highlights the inadequacy of phenomenological approaches in describing the metrological capability and thermodynamic behavior of systems at SC. Additionally, we demonstrate the effect of bath on system's phase transition at SC.

Title: Numerical extraction of crosscap coefficients in microscopic models for (2+1)D conformal field theory
Authors: Jia-Ming Dong, Yueshui Zhang, Kai-Wen Huang, Hong-Hao Tu, Ying-Hai Wu
Abstract: Conformal field theory (CFT) can be placed on disparate space-time manifolds to facilitate investigations of their properties. For (2+1)D theories, one useful choice is the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^3$ obtained by identifying antipodal points on the boundary sphere of a three-dimensional ball. One-point functions of scalar primary fields on this manifold generally do not vanish and encode the so-called crosscap coefficients. These coefficients also manifest on the sphere as the overlaps between certain crosscap states and CFT primary states. Taking the (2+1)D Ising CFT as a concrete example, we demonstrate that crosscap coefficients can be extracted from microscopic models. We construct crosscap states in both lattice models defined on polyhedrons and continuum models in Landau levels, where the degrees of freedom at antipodal points are entangled in Bell-type states. By computing their overlaps with the eigenstates of many-body Hamiltonians, we obtain results consistent with those from conformal bootstrap. Importantly, our approach directly reveals the absolute values of crosscap overlaps, whereas bootstrap calculations typically yield only their ratios. Furthermore, we investigate the finite-size scaling of these overlaps and their evolution under perturbations away from criticality.

Title: On-chip Single-crystal Plasmonic Optoelectronics for Efficient Hot Carrier Collection and Photovoltage Detection
Authors: Yunxuan Zhu, Sai. C. Yelishala, Shusen Liao, Jackson Shropshire, Douglas Natelson, Longji Cui
Abstract: Large-area chemically synthesized single-crystal metals with nanometer-scale thickness have emerged as promising materials for on-chip nanophotonic applications, owing to their superior plasmonic properties compared to nanofabricated polycrystalline counterparts. While much recent attention has focused on their optical properties, the combined optimal electrical and optical characteristics, which hold great potential for high-performance optoelectronic functionalities, remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a single-crystal plasmonic optoelectronic platform based on nanowires fabricated from synthesized gold flakes and demonstrate its capabilities for highly enhanced hot carrier collection, electroluminescence, and photovoltage detection. Notably, single-crystal gold nanogap devices exhibit an order of magnitude higher open-circuit photovoltage compared to polycrystalline devices, representing one of the highest reported photovoltage sensing performances in terms of on-chip device density and responsivity per area. Our analysis revealed that this enhancement is attributed mostly to the suppression of electron-phonon scattering and improved hot carrier tunneling efficiency in single-crystal devices. These results highlight the potential of large-scale single-crystal nanostructures for both fundamental studies of nanoscale hot carrier transport and scalable electrically driven nanophotonic applications.

Title: Refraction laws in temporal media
Authors: Cristian E. Gutiérrez, Eric Stachura
Abstract: We consider the time dependent Maxwell system in the sense of distributions in the context of temporal interfaces. Just as with spatial interfaces, electromagnetic waves at temporal interfaces scatter and create a transmitted and reflected wave. We provide a rigorous derivation of boundary conditions for the electric and magnetic fields at temporal interfaces with precise assumptions on the material parameters. In turn, we use this to obtain a general Snell's Law at such interfaces. From this, we obtain explicit formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients. Unlike previous works, we do not make any simplifying ansatz on the solution to the Maxwell system, nor do we assume that the fields are smooth. We also consider material parameters which are not necessarily constant on either side of the temporal interface.

Title: Anyonic Josephson junctions: Dynamical and ground-state properties
Authors: Jessica John Britto
Abstract: Bosons with density-dependent hopping on a one dimensional lattice have been shown to emulate anyonic particles with fractional exchange statistics. Leveraging this, we construct a Josephson junction setup, where an insulating barrier in the form of a Mott-insulator is sandwiched between two superfluid phases. This is obtained by spatially varying either the statistical phase or the strength of the on-site interaction potential on which the ground state of the system depends. Utilizing numerical methods such as exact diagonalization and density renormalization group theory, the ground state properties of this setup are investigated to understand the Josephson effect in a strongly correlated regime. The dynamical properties of this model for different configurations of this model are analyzed to find the configurations that can produce the Josephson effect. Furthermore, it is observed that continuous particle flow over time is achievable in this proposed model solely by creating an initial phase difference without any external biasing.

Title: Device-scale modeling of valley photovoltaics
Authors: Daixi Xia, Hassan Allami, Jacob J. Krich
Abstract: We present a Poisson/drift-diffusion model that includes valley scattering effects for simulating valley photovoltaic devices. The valley photovoltaic concept is a novel implementation of a hot-carrier solar cell and leverages the valley scattering effect under large electric field to potentially achieve high voltage and high efficiency. Fabricated devices have shown S-shaped current-voltage curves, low fill factor, and thus low efficiency. We hence develop the first device model for valley photovoltaics. Our model includes electric-field-dependent valley scattering rates extracted from previous ensemble Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the condition of nonequilibrium carrier populations in the satellite valleys is not enough for valley photovoltaics to achieve high efficiency. We also show that increasing the built-in electric field of the valley-scattering region does not improve efficiency, contrary to previous suggestion.

Title: Circuit simulation of readout process toward large-scale superconducting quantum circuits
Authors: Tetsufumi Tanamoto, Hiroshi Fuketa, Toyofumi Ishikawa, Shiro Kawabata
Abstract: The rapid scaling of superconducting quantum computers has highlighted the impact of device-level variability on overall circuit fidelity. In particular, fabrication-induced fluctuations in device parameters such as capacitance and Josephson critical current pose significant challenges to large-scale integration. We propose a simulation methodology for estimating qubit fidelity based on classical circuit simulation, using a conventional Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) simulator. This approach enables the evaluation of the performance of superconducting quantum circuits with 10000 qubits on standard laptop computers. The proposed method provides an accessible tool for the early stage assessment of large-scale superconducting quantum circuit performance.

Title: Poliazed Houston State Framework for Nonequilibrium Driven Open Quanum Sysmtes
Authors: Shunsuke A. Sato, Hannes Hübener, Umberto De Giovannini, Angel Rubio
Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework --the polarized Houston basis-- to model nonequilibrium dynamics in driven open quantum systems, formulated for use within the quantum master equation. This basis extends conventional Houston states by incorporating field-induced polarization effects, enabling a more accurate description of excitation dynamics under external driving. Using a one-dimensional dimer-chain model, we examine band population dynamics through projections onto polarized Houston states, original Houston states, and naive Bloch states. We find that the polarized Houston basis significantly suppresses spurious Bloch-state excitations and virtual transitions present in standard Houston approaches, allowing for a cleaner extraction of real excitations. When implemented in the relaxation time approximation of the quantum master equation, this formalism also yields a substantial reduction of unphysical DC currents in insulating systems. Our results highlight the polarized Houston basis as a powerful tool for simulating nonequilibrium phenomena in light-driven open quantum materials.

Title: L-Cysteine Polymorph Coatings for THz Sensing Metasurfaces
Authors: M. Zhezhu, A. Vasilev, H. Parsamyan, T. Abrahamyan, G. Baghdasaryan, S. Gyozalyan, D. A. Ghazaryan, H. Gharagulyan
Abstract: The electromagnetic response of metasurfaces can be intentionally engineered by carefully designing their unit cells. Narrowband metasurfaces, characterized by high quality factors, can serve as an efficient platform for biosensing in optical to THz regimes, to explore new structural forms of biomolecules, further elevating the capabilities of THz sensing technologies. In this study, an all-metallic metasurface featuring structural asymmetry is proposed to analyze L-Cysteine with orthorhombic and monoclinic crystallographic structures. The influence of the concentration of L-Cysteine in the monoclinic phase on the THz response of the metasurface was performed using a drop-casting method. Our findings reveal a noticeable frequency shift as analyte concentration raises, underscoring the potential for high sensitivity in detecting biomolecules. Thus, this research demonstrates that asymmetric THz metasurfaces offer rather promising detection capabilities at lower THz frequencies between two crystallographic structures of L Cysteine, with a Q-factor of 37, and a sensitivity of 1.430 THz ml/g. We believe that our results can be of great value to the development of biosensors for improved material characterization at low frequencies.

Title: Emission enhanced exciton-polariton condensates with optical feedback
Authors: R. Mirek, M. Furman, A. Opala, M. Król, W. Pacuski, J. Szczytko, H. Sigurðsson, B. Piętka
Abstract: Optical feedback is a well-known method of controlling laser dynamics, which has been widely studied in photonic systems to induce complex behaviors such as chaos or enhanced coherence. However, its application to systems in the strong light-matter coupling regime remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce a delayed optical feedback loop into a nonresonantly pumped polariton condensate. By feeding part of the emission back into the cavity to seed the next condensate, we observe a strong increase in the output intensity, up to 110%. We explain this effect using a classical rate equation model for the condensate coupled to excitonic reservoirs. Our results evidence that polariton condensates can respond strongly to optical feedback, congruent with well known polariton amplification techniques using resonant pump-probe setups. Our method opens new possibilities for using polariton feedback to connect multiple condensates and can be an essential step toward neuromorphic computing based on recurrent signaling in photonic systems.

Title: Controlled Fission and Superposition of Vector Solitons in an Integrable Model of Two-Component Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Ramesh Kumar Vaduganathan, Rajadurai Vijayan, Boris A. Malomed
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of vector solitons in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensates governed by the system of Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Using a gauge-transformation approach, we construct a four-soliton solution and analyze their interactions, including superposition states, fission, and shape-preserving collisions. We explore the ability of time-dependent parameters, such as the intra- and intercomponent interaction coefficients and trapping potential, to control the soliton properties. In particular, we demonstrate controlled four-soliton fission, highlighting its potential applications to quantum data processing and coherent matter-wave transport. The results suggest experimental realization in BEC systems and provide insights into nonlinear wave interactions in multicomponent quantum fluids.

Title: On correlation functions of the open XYZ spin 1/2 chain with boundary fields related by a constraint
Authors: G. Niccoli, V. Terras
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the quantum XYZ open spin-1/2 chain with boundary fields. We focus on the particular case in which the six boundary parameters are related by a single constraint enabling us to describe part of the spectrum by standard Bethe equations. We derive for this model exact representations for a set of elementary blocks of correlation functions, hence generalising to XYZ the results obtained in the XXZ open case in arXiv:2208.10097. Our approach is also similar to the approach proposed in the XXZ case arXiv:2208.10097: we solve the model by Sklyanin's version of the quantum Separation of Variables, using Baxter's Vertex-IRF transformation; in this framework, we identify a basis of local operators with a relatively simple action on the transfer matrix eigenstates; we then use the solution of the quantum inverse problem and our recent formulae on scalar products of separate states arXiv:2402.04112 to compute some of the corresponding matrix elements, which can therefore be considered as elementary building blocks for the correlation functions. The latter are expressed in terms of multiple sums in the finite chain, and as multiple integrals in the thermodynamic limit. Our results evidence that, once the basis of local operators is properly chosen, the corresponding building blocks for correlation functions have a similar structure in the XXX/XXZ/XYZ open chains, and do not require any insertion of non-local "tail operators".

Title: Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement in quantum annealing
Authors: Keita Takahashi, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising metaheuristic for solving constrained combinatorial optimization problems. However, parameter tuning difficulties and hardware noise often prevent optimal solutions from being properly encoded as the ground states of the problem Hamiltonian. This study investigates mid-anneal measurement as a mitigation approach for such situations, analyzing its effectiveness and underlying physical mechanisms. We introduce a quantitative metric to evaluate the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement and apply it to the graph bipartitioning problem and the quadratic knapsack problem. Our findings reveal that mid-anneal measurement is most effective when the energy difference between desired solutions and ground states is small, with effectiveness strongly governed by the energy structure. Furthermore, the effectiveness increases as the Hamming distance between the ground and excited states gets small, highlighting the role of state similarity. Analysis of fully-connected Ising models demonstrates that the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement persists with increasing system size, indicating its scalability and practical applicability to large-scale quantum annealing.

Abstract: Single photons source (SPS) is a key component required by quantum communication devices. We report the finding of bright diamond-based SPS created by nature millions of years ago. It is shown that narrow ($\leq$ 2 nm) lines observed within the 500-800 nm range in photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the surface layer of untreated Yakut diamonds rich in nitrogen and hydrogen belong to SPS. Moreover, unknown narrow-line PL observed earlier in nitrogen- and hydrogen-rich diamonds from various deposits around the world are thought to be associated with SPS. Thus, the diamond rim, which until now was sent to the dumps or, at best, used as an abrasive powder, turned out to be a valuable material suitable for use in quantum technologies.

Our results clarify the relation between the three representations of the steady state and provide the matrix product solution that has not been available for this model before.

Title: Neural Importance Resampling: A Practical Sampling Strategy for Neural Quantum States
Authors: Eimantas Ledinauskas, Egidijus Anisimovas
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating many-body quantum systems, but their practical use is often hindered by limitations of current sampling techniques. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods suffer from slow mixing and require manual tuning, while autoregressive NQS impose restrictive architectural constraints that complicate the enforcement of symmetries and the construction of determinant-based multi-state wave functions. In this work, we introduce Neural Importance Resampling (NIR), a new sampling algorithm that combines importance resampling with a separately trained autoregressive proposal network. This approach enables efficient and unbiased sampling without constraining the NQS architecture. We demonstrate that NIR supports stable and scalable training, including for multi-state NQS, and mitigates issues faced by MCMC and autoregressive approaches. Numerical experiments on the 2D transverse-field Ising model show that NIR outperforms MCMC in challenging regimes and yields results competitive with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Our results establish NIR as a robust alternative for sampling in variational NQS algorithms.

Title: Evaluating First-Principles Electron-Phonon Couplings: Consistency Across Methods and Implementations
Authors: Konrad Merkel, Maximilian F. X. Dorfner, Manuel Engel, Georg Kresse, Frank Ortmann
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is fundamental for understanding the behavior of molecules and crystals, influencing phenomena such as charge transport, energy transfer, phase transitions, and polaron formation. Accurate computational methods to calculate EPCs from first principles are essential, but their complexity has resulted in a variety of computational strategies, raising concerns about their mutual consistency. In this study, we provide a systematic benchmark of methods for EPC calculation by comparing two fundamentally different {\it ab initio} methodologies. We investigate Gaussian-type orbital methods based on the \textsc{CP2K} code and plane-wave-based projector-augmented-wave (PAW) methods combined with maximally localized Wannier functions, as implemented in \textsc{VASP} and \textsc{wannier90}. In addition, we further distinguish between the derivative--of--Hamiltonian ($dH$) and derivative--of--states ($d\psi$) approaches for obtaining EPC parameters. The comparison is conducted on a representative set of organic molecules, including pyrazine, pyridine, bithiophene, and quarterthiophene, varying significantly in size and flexibility. We find excellent agreement across implementations and basis sets when employing the same computational approach ($dH$ or $d\psi$), demonstrating robust consistency between the numerical schemes. However, noticeable deviations occur when comparing the $dH$ and $d\psi$ approaches within each code and for specific cases discussed in detail. Our findings emphasize the reliability of EPC computations using the $dH$ method and caution against potential pitfalls associated with the $d\psi$ approach, providing guidance for future EPC calculations and model parameterizations.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analytical study that extends the conventional formulation of Berry curvature, highlighting its derivation in the context of problematic domains of definition of the operators. Our analysis reveals that handling these domains carefully can have a substantial impact on Berry curvature, demonstrating that even Hamiltonians without explicit parameter dependence may exhibit nonzero Berry curvature. This finding emphasizes that Berry curvature is intrinsically related to the eigenvectors rather than the Hamiltonian itself. Our approach utilizes the standard Bloch (k-space) framework for spatially periodic systems, illustrating these effects from first principles and discussing potential implications for solid-state systems.

Title: Femtosecond Engineering of magnetic Domain Walls via Nonequilibrium Spin Textures
Authors: Yuzhu Fan, Gaolong Cao, Junlin Wang, Sheng Jiang, Jing Wu, Johan Åkerman, Jonas Weissenrieder
Abstract: Ultrafast optical control of magnetic textures offers new opportunities for energy-efficient, high-speed spintronic devices. While uniform magnetization reversal via all-optical switching is well established, the formation dynamics of non-uniform domain walls (DWs) under ultrafast excitation remain poorly understood. Here, we use Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy combined with transient optical grating excitation to directly image the real-time formation of DWs in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film. We observe a rapid evolution from disordered spin contrast to ordered DW arrays within 10 ps, including a transient, strongly asymmetric DW state. In a narrow fluence window, short-lived DWs form and spontaneously vanish within picoseconds. Multiscale simulations combining atomistic spin dynamics and micromagnetics reveal a nonlinear nucleation pathway involving a hybrid transition state where localized, unstable spin textures coalesce into metastable DWs. This nonequilibrium mechanism explains the observed asymmetry and spatial ordering, and establishes a framework for controlling spin textures in magnetic materials on femtosecond timescales.

Title: Fourth-order quantum master equations reveal that spin-phonon decoherence undercuts long magnetization relaxation times in single-molecule magnets
Authors: Alessandro Lunghi
Abstract: Spin-phonon interaction is known to drive magnetic relaxation in solid-state systems, but little evidence is available on how it affects coherence time. Here we extend fourth-order quantum master equations to account for coherence terms and describe the full effect of up to two-phonon processes on spin dynamics. We numerically implement this method fully ab initio for a single-molecule magnet with large magnetization blocking temperature and show that while strong axial magnetic anisotropy ensures slow magnetic relaxation approaching seconds at 77 K, the superposition of Kramers doublets is coherent for less than 10 ns due to a novel two-phonon pure dephasing mechanism.

Title: Identification and Properties of Topological States in the Bulk of Quasicrystals
Authors: Frode Balling-Ansø, Jeppe Lykke Krogh, Ella Elisabeth Lassen, Anne E. B. Nielsen
Abstract: In contrast to the usual bulk-boundary correspondence, topological states localized within the bulk of the system have been numerically identified in quasicrystalline structures, termed bulk localized transport (BLT) states. These states exhibit properties different from edge states, one example being that the number of BLT states scales with system size, while the number of edge states scales with system perimeter. Here, we define an algorithm to identify BLT states, which is based on the physically motivated crosshair marker and robustness analyses. Applying the algorithm to the Hofstadter model on the Ammann-Beenker tiling, we find that the BLT states appear mainly for magnetic fluxes within a specific interval. While edge states appear at low densities of states, we find that BLT states can appear at many different densities of states. Many of the BLT states are found to have real-space localization that follows geometric patterns characteristic of the given quasicrystal. Furthermore, BLT states can appear both isolated and in groups within the energy spectrum which could imply greater robustness for the states within such groups. The spatial localization of the states within a certain group can change depending on the Fermi energy.

Title: Herd Immunity with Spatial Adaptation Based on Global Prevalence Information
Authors: Akhil Panicker, Sasidevan V
Abstract: During an epidemic outbreak, individuals often modify their behavior in response to global prevalence cues, using spatially mediated adaptations such as reduced mobility or transmission range. In this work, we investigate the impact of distance-based adaptive behaviors on epidemic dynamics, where a fraction of the population adjusts its transmission range and susceptibility to infection based on global prevalence. We consider three adaptation scenarios: a constant adaptive fraction, a power-law dependence and a sigmoidal dependence of adaptive fraction on global prevalence. In the spatially well-mixed regime, we analytically obtain critical adaptation thresholds necessary for epidemic mitigation and in the spatially static regime, we establish bounds for the thresholds using continuum percolation results. Our results indicate that a linear adaptive response to prevalence provides no additional advantage over a constant adaptive fraction in controlling outbreaks, and a highly super-linear response is required to suppress epidemic spread. For a sigmoidal adaptation, we identify conditions under which oscillations in prevalence can emerge, with peak prevalence exhibiting a non-monotonic dependence on the width of the sigmoidal function, suggesting an optimal parameter range that minimizes epidemic severity. We obtain prevalence, final epidemic size, and peak prevalence as functions of adaptation parameters in all adaptation scenarios considered, providing a comprehensive characterization of the effects of spatial adaptation based on global prevalence information in shaping adaptive epidemic dynamics.

Title: Superconducting flux concentrator coils for levitation of particles in the Meissner state
Authors: Robert Smit, Martijn Janse, Eli van der Bent, Thijmen de Jong, Kier Heeck, Jaimy Plugge, Tjerk Oosterkamp, Bas Hensen
Abstract: Magnetic levitation of superconductors is a promising platform to study quantum mechanics in the large-mass limit. One major limitation is the weak trapping potential, which results in low vibrational eigenfrequencies and increased susceptibility to low-frequency noise. While generating strong magnetic fields is relatively straightforward, creating a tightly confined harmonic potential - essentially achieving a large magnetic field gradient - remains a significant challenge. In this work, we demonstrate a potential solution using superconducting cores that concentrate magnetic flux into arbitrarily small volumes. We show the ability to trap superconducting particles using an anti-Helmholtz coil configuration incorporating these cores. However, we observe rapid damping of the levitated particle motion due to flux trapping within the cores, occurring once the lower critical field is exceeded locally. To investigate this mechanism, we employ diamond NV center magnetometry and detect substantial remanent fields persisting after high-current operation of the coils. Finally, we discuss possible strategies to mitigate this effect and improve the levitation properties.

Title: Designing topological cluster synchronization patterns with the Dirac operator
Authors: Ahmed A. A. Zaid, Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: Designing stable cluster synchronization patterns is a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics of networks with great relevance to understanding neuronal and brain dynamics. So far, cluster synchronizion have been studied exclusively in a node-based dynamical approach, according to which oscillators are associated only with the nodes of the network. Here, we propose a topological synchronization dynamics model based on the use of the Topological Dirac operator, which allows us to design cluster synchronization patterns for topological oscillators associated with both nodes and edges of a network. In particular, by modulating the ground state of the free energy associated with the dynamical model we construct topological cluster synchronization patterns. These are aligned with the eigenstates of the Topological Dirac Equation that provide a very useful decomposition of the dynamical state of node and edge signals associated with the network. We use linear stability analysis to predict the stability of the topological cluster synchronization patterns and provide numerical evidence of the ability to design several stable topological cluster synchronization states on random graphs and on stochastic block models.

Abstract: Hyperbolic phonon polaritons - hybridized modes arising from the ultrastrong coupling of infrared light to strongly anisotropic lattice vibrations in uniaxial or biaxial polar crystals - enable to confine light to the nanoscale with low losses and high directionality. In even lower symmetry materials, such as monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ (bGO), hyperbolic shear polaritons (HShPs) further enhance the directionality. Yet, HShPs are intrinsically supported only within narrow frequency ranges defined by the phonon frequencies of the host material. Here, we report spectral tuning of HShPs in bGO by isotopic substitution. Employing near-field optical microscopy to image HShPs in $^{18}$O bGO films homo-epitaxially grown on a $^{16}$O bGO substrate, we demonstrate a spectral redshift of $\sim~40~$cm$^{-1}$ for the $^{18}$O bGO, compared to $^{16}$O bGO. The technique allows for direct observation and a model-free estimation of the spectral shift driven by isotopic substitution without the need for knowledge of the dielectric tensor. Complementary far-field measurements and ab initio calculations - in good agreement with the near-field data - confirm the effectiveness of this estimation. This multifaceted study demonstrates a significant isotopic substitution induced spectral tuning of HShPs into a previously inaccessible frequency range, creating new avenues for technological applications of such highly directional polaritons.

Title: Color and Transparency from Quantum Geometry
Authors: Chang-geun Oh, Sun-Woo Kim
Abstract: The optical properties of solids are governed not only by their energy band dispersions but also by the quantum geometry of Bloch states. While the role of energy bands in determining the perceived optical appearance of materials, such as color and transparency, is well established, the influence of quantum geometry remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the color and transparency of materials can be direct manifestations of their underlying quantum geometry. To illustrate this principle, we employ quadratic band-touching models that allow us to tune only the geometric properties of Bloch states, while keeping the energy dispersion fixed. This decoupling reveals that modifying the wavefunction texture alone can lead to dramatic changes in the optical conductivity and, consequently, in the reflectance spectrum of the material. This results in distinct and controllable changes in perceived color. Similarly, we show that quantum geometry can govern the transparency of two-dimensional materials. Our findings demonstrate how quantum geometry shapes the visual appearance of materials, opening new avenues for tailoring color and transparency beyond traditional band structure design. This establishes quantum geometric engineering as a novel approach for manipulating materials with customized optical functionalities.

Title: Roto-translational optomechanics
Authors: M. Rademacher, A. Pontin, J. M. H. Gosling, P. F. Barker, M. Toroš
Abstract: Levitated optomechanics, the interaction between light and small levitated objects, is a new macroscopic quantum system that is being used as a testing ground for fundamental physics and for the development of sensors with exquisite sensitivity. The utility of this system, when compared to other quantum optomechanical systems, is its extreme isolation from the environment and, by the relatively few degrees of freedom that a levitated object has. While work in the field has strongly focused on the three translational degrees of freedom of this system, it has become increasingly important to understand the induced rotational motion of levitated objects, particularly in optical trapping fields, but also in magnetic and electric traps. These additional three degrees of freedom, which are intrinsic to levitated systems, offer a new set of optomechanical nonlinear interactions that lead to a rich and yet largely unexplored roto-translational motion. The control and utilization of these interactions promise to extend the utility of levitated optomechanics in both fundamental studies and applications. In this review, we provide an overview of levitated optomechanics, before focusing on the roto-translational motion of optically levitated anisotropic objects. We first present a classical treatment of this induced motion, bridging the gap between classical and quantum formalisms. We describe the different types of roto-translational motion for different particle shapes via their interaction with polarized optical trapping fields. Subsequently, we provide an overview of the theoretical and experimental approaches as well as applications that have established this new field. The review concludes with an outlook of promising experiments and applications, including the creation of non-classical states of roto-translational motion, quantum-limited torque sensing and particle characterization methods.

Title: Target-density formation in swarms with stochastic sensing and dynamics
Authors: Jason Hindes, George Stantchev, Klimka Szwaykowska Kasraie, Ira B. Schwartz
Abstract: An important goal for swarming research is to create methods for predicting, controlling and designing swarms, which produce collective dynamics that solve a problem through emergent and stable pattern formation, without the need for constant intervention, and with a minimal number of parameters and controls. One such problem involves a swarm collectively producing a desired (target) density through local sensing, motion, and interactions in a domain. Here, we take a statistical physics perspective and develop and analyze a model wherein agents move in a stochastic walk over a networked domain, so as to reduce the error between the swarm density and the target, based on local, random, and uncertain measurements of the current density by the swarming agents. Using a combination of mean-field, small-fluctuation, and finite-number analysis, we are able to quantify how close and how fast a swarm comes to producing a target as a function of sensing uncertainty, stochastic collision rates, numbers of agents, and spatial variation of the target.

Title: Planckian bound on quantum dynamical entropy
Authors: Xiangyu Cao
Abstract: We introduce a simple definition of dynamical entropy for quantum systems under continuous monitoring, inspired by Connes, Narnhofer and Thirring. It quantifies the amount of information gained about the initial condition. A nonzero entropy rate can be obtained by monitoring the thermal fluctuation of an extensive observable in a generic many-body system (away from classical or large N limit). We explicitly compute the entropy rate in the thermodynamic and long-time limit, in terms of the two-point correlation functions. We conjecture a universal Planckian bound for the entropy rate. Related results on the purification rate are also obtained.

Title: Breaking the Precision Ceiling in Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Hybrid Fourier-Neural Architecture for Ultra-High Accuracy
Authors: Wei Shan Lee, Chi Kiu Althina Chau, Kei Chon Sio, Kam Ian Leong
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have plateaued at errors of $10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ for fourth-order partial differential equations, creating a perceived precision ceiling that limits their adoption in engineering applications. We break through this barrier with a hybrid Fourier-neural architecture for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, achieving unprecedented L2 error of $1.94 \times 10^{-7}$-a 17-fold improvement over standard PINNs and \(15-500\times\) better than traditional numerical methods. Our approach synergistically combines a truncated Fourier series capturing dominant modal behavior with a deep neural network providing adaptive residual corrections. A systematic harmonic optimization study revealed a counter-intuitive discovery: exactly 10 harmonics yield optimal performance, with accuracy catastrophically degrading from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$ beyond this threshold. The two-phase optimization strategy (Adam followed by L-BFGS) and adaptive weight balancing enable stable ultra-precision convergence. GPU-accelerated implementation achieves sub-30-minute training despite fourth-order derivative complexity. By addressing 12 critical gaps in existing approaches-from architectural rigidity to optimization landscapes-this work demonstrates that ultra-precision is achievable through proper design, opening new paradigms for scientific computing where machine learning can match or exceed traditional numerical methods.

Title: ProForm: Solder-Free Circuit Assembly Using Thermoforming
Authors: Narjes Pourjafarian, Zhenming Yang, Jeffrey I. Lipton, Benyamin Davaji, Gregory D. Abowd
Abstract: Electronic waste (e-waste) is a growing global challenge, with millions of functional components discarded due to the difficulty of repair and reuse. Traditional circuit assembly relies on soldering, which creates semi-permanent bonds that limit component recovery and contribute to unnecessary waste. We introduce ProForm, a thermoforming approach for solder-free circuit prototyping. By encapsulating electronic components with pressure-formed thermoplastics, ProForm enables secure, reversible mounting without the need for solder or custom mechanical housings. This approach supports a wide range of substrates, including flexible, paper-based, and non-planar circuits, facilitating easy reuse, replacement, and rapid prototyping. We demonstrate ProForm's versatility to support prototyping practices. We show that ProFormed circuits exhibit good electrical performance and mechanical stability. While motivated by a need for sustainable electronics practices, ProForm has other significant advantages over traditional soldering.

Title: Entanglement negativity in free fermions: twisted characteristic polynomial, universal bounds, and area laws
Authors: Ryota Matsuda, Zongping Gong
Abstract: We present a general and simple formula for computing the entanglement negativity in free fermions. Our formula allows for deriving several universal bounds on negativity and its rate of change in dynamics. The bound on negativity directly relates the clustering property of correlations in free-fermion states to the entanglement area law, and provides the optimal condition for the area law in mixed free fermion states with long-range correlations. In addition, we establish an area-law bound on entanglement generation in open systems, analogous to previously known results for entanglement entropy in unitary dynamics. Our work provides new analytical insights into fermionic mixed-state entanglement.

Title: Quantum Walks on Arbitrary Spatial Networks with Rydberg Atoms
Authors: Gabriel Almeida, Raul Santos, Lara Janiurek, Yasser Omar
Abstract: Rydberg atoms provide a highly promising platform for quantum computation, leveraging their strong tunable interactions to encode and manipulate information in the electronic states of individual atoms. Key advantages of Rydberg atoms include scalability, reconfigurable connectivity, and native multi-qubit gates, making them particularly well-suited for addressing complex network problems. These problems can often be framed as graph-based tasks, which can be efficiently addressed using quantum walks. In this work, we propose a general implementation of staggered quantum walks with Rydberg atoms, with a particular focus on spatial networks. We also present an efficient algorithm for constructing the tessellations required for the staggered quantum walk. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposal achieves quadratic speedup in spatial search algorithms.

Title: Information in 4D-STEM: Where it is, and How to Use it
Authors: Desheng Ma, Guanxing Li, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
Abstract: Contrast transfer mechanisms for electron scattering have been extensively studied in transmission electron microscopy. Here we revisit H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism from scattering theory to understand where information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data, and consequently identify new imaging modes that can also serve as crude but fast approximations to ptychography. We show that tilt correction and summation of the symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk -- corresponding to tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC) respectively -- enables aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that makes maximal use of the 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond the WPOA, we identify the contrast transfer from the interference between inelastic/plural scattering electrons, which show up as quadratic terms, and show that under overfocus conditions, contrast can be further enhanced at selected frequencies, similar to phase-contrast TEM imaging. There is also usable information encoded in the dark field region which we demonstrate by constructing a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) that sums up the incoherent scattering components and holds promise for depth sectioning of strong scatterers. This framework generalizes phase contrast theory in conventional/scanning transmission electron microscopy to 4D-STEM and provides analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography, which blindly exploits all above contrast mechanisms.

Title: Liquid Droplet as Adaptive Material while Levitating via Coupling between Plasma and Kelvin Force

Abstract: Fascinating in art and science, the ability to float is also captivating and relevant in practical applications, such as Penning and ion traps that are fundamental to quantum computing. In this work, we first reproduce the classic water bridge by glycerol and, as it breaks down due to thermal agitation, observe that a lump of glycerol with mass~2.5 g can float and exhibit near-periodic oscillations. Through experiments, finite element analysis, and simulations, we discover that the stability of the floating droplet is made possible by the interaction between three mechanisms: Deformation, Plasma, and Kelvin force. Note that glycerol cluster (GC) falls in the class of adaptive materials that can change their properties or behavior in response to varying environmental conditions, i.e., stimuli-responsive. Furthermore, the stimuli, modified by the deformation of GC, collaborate with it to create this unique simple, yet stable, floating system. Backed up by simulations, this process, operated by only a single pair of electrodes, holds the potential to develop a simple yet powerful railgun.

Title: Anderson Delocalization in Strongly-Coupled Disordered Non-Hermitian Chains
Authors: Wei-Wu Jin, Jin Liu, Xin Wang, Yu-Ran Zhang, Xueqin Huang, Xiaomin Wei, Wenbo Ju, Zhongmin Yang, Tao Liu, Franco Nori
Abstract: Disorder and non-Hermitian effects together can upend how waves localize. In a 1D disordered chain, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) can induce Anderson delocalization, defying the usual rule that disorder in low dimensions always localizes states. While weak disorder leaves the NHSE intact, strong disorder restores Anderson localization. Here, we study a surprising twist: coupling a strongly disordered Hatano-Nelson chain to a disordered Hermitian chain with their disorder anti-symmetrically correlated. Strikingly, once the inter-chain coupling exceeds a threshold, the system undergoes Anderson delocalization irrespective of disorder strength, reinstating the NHSE with no Hermitian counterpart. This transition arises from the interplay of non-reciprocal hopping, inter-chain coupling, and engineered disorder correlations, and is captured by a real-space winding number. To confirm this, we build an electrical-circuit analog and directly observe the re-emergent NHSE via voltage measurements. Our work uncovers unexplored and experimentally accessible physics at the crossroads of non-Hermiticity and disorder.

Title: The feedback driven atomic scale Josephson microscope
Authors: Samuel D. Escribano, Víctor Barrena, David Perconte, Jose Antonio Moreno, Marta Fernández Lomana, Miguel Águeda, Edwin Herrera, Beilun Wu, Jose Gabriel Rodrigo, Elsa Prada, Isabel Guillamón, Alfredo Levy Yeyati, Hermann Suderow
Abstract: The ultimate spatial limit to establish a Josephson coupling between two superconducting electrodes is an atomic-scale junction. The Josephson effect in such ultrasmall junctions has been used to unveil new switching dynamics, study coupling close to superconducting bound states or reveal non-reciprocal effects. However, the Josephson coupling is weak and the sensitivity to temperature reduces the Cooper pair current magnitude. Here we show that a feedback element induces a time-dependent bistable regime which consists of spontaneous periodic oscillations between two different Cooper pair tunneling states (corresponding to the DC and AC Josephson regimes respectively). The amplitude of the time-averaged current within the bistable regime is almost independent of temperature. By tracing the periodic oscillations in the new bistable regime as a function of the position in a Scanning Tunneling Microscope, we obtain atomic scale maps of the critical current in 2H-NbSe$_2$ and find spatial modulations due to a pair density wave. Our results fundamentally improve our understanding of atomic size Josephson junctions including a feedback element in the circuit and provide a promising new route to study superconducting materials through atomic scale maps of the Josephson coupling.

The method allows expressing the linearity in terms of the achievable spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of the created devices, in particular superconductive electronic devices, and therefore can be easy correlated with the obtained experimental data. The algorithm scheme and the method accuracy are considered and discussed in detail.

Title: Recurrent neural network wave functions for Rydberg atom arrays on kagome lattice
Authors: Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Ejaaz Merali, Giacomo Torlai, Roger G Melko, Juan Carrasquilla
Abstract: Rydberg atom array experiments have demonstrated the ability to act as powerful quantum simulators, preparing strongly-correlated phases of matter which are challenging to study for conventional computer simulations. A key direction has been the implementation of interactions on frustrated geometries, in an effort to prepare exotic many-body states such as spin liquids and glasses. In this paper, we apply two-dimensional recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions to study the ground states of Rydberg atom arrays on the kagome lattice. We implement an annealing scheme to find the RNN variational parameters in regions of the phase diagram where exotic phases may occur, corresponding to rough optimization landscapes. For Rydberg atom array Hamiltonians studied previously on the kagome lattice, our RNN ground states show no evidence of exotic spin liquid or emergent glassy behavior. In the latter case, we argue that the presence of a non-zero Edwards-Anderson order parameter is an artifact of the long autocorrelations times experienced with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, and we show that autocorrelations can be systematically reduced by increasing numerical effort. This result emphasizes the utility of autoregressive models, such as RNNs, in conjunction with QMC, to explore Rydberg atom array physics on frustrated lattices and beyond.

Authors: F. Ahrens, N. Crescini, A. Irace, G. Rastelli, P. Falferi, A. Giachero, B. Margesin, R. Mezzena, A. Vinante, I. Carusotto, F. Mantegazzini
Abstract: Frequency-based synthetic dimensions are a promising avenue for expanding the dimensionality of photonic systems. In this work, we show how a tilted synthetic lattice is naturally realised by periodically modulating a single-mode resonator under a coherent monochromatic drive. We theoretically study the Bloch wave dynamics in the tilted synthetic lattice, which gives rise to peculiar features in the spectral distribution of the cavity field. Our predictions are experimentally confirmed using a planar tunable superconducting microwave resonator.

Title: Thermalization is typical in large classical and quantum harmonic systems
Authors: Marco Cattaneo, Marco Baldovin, Dario Lucente, Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi, Angelo Vulpiani
Abstract: We establish an analytical criterion for dynamical thermalization within harmonic systems, applicable to both classical and quantum models. Specifically, we prove that thermalization of various observables, such as particle energies in physically relevant random quadratic Hamiltonians, is typical for large systems ($N \gg 1$) with initial conditions drawn from the microcanonical distribution. Moreover, we show that thermalization can also arise from non-typical initial conditions, where only a finite fraction of the normal modes is excited. A different choice of initial conditions, such as all the initial energy localized in a single particle, instead leads to energy equipartition without thermalization. Since the models we consider are integrable, our findings provide a general dynamical basis for an approach to thermalization that bypasses chaos and ergodicity, focusing instead on the physical requirement that thermodynamic observables depend on a large number of normal modes, and build a bridge between the classical and quantum theories of thermalization.

Title: Paste extrusion generates a surface lubrication layer
Authors: Richard T. Benders, Menno Thomas, Thomas M.M. Bastiaansen, Raoul Fix, Mario Scheel, Guido Bosch, Sonja de Vries, Jasper van der Gucht, Joshua A. Dijksman
Abstract: Dense particle-fluid mixtures, or \emph{pastes}, are encountered in the production of various materials, including animal feed, human food, pharmaceuticals, and biomass for bioenergy. The flow behavior of such dense deformable particulate media is poorly understood, as the interplay between applied stresses, particle deformability and interstitial fluids can be very complex. One challenging context is high pressure pipe flow, encountered in extrusion. Despite its widespread use, many questions remain about how during high pressure flow of the paste, the particle-fluid mixture behaves and interacts with boundaries. We show how high pressure paste extrusion induces the formation of a fluid boundary thinner than the particle size. The induced fluid layer emerges from a pressure-induced phase segregation process. The fluid layer is sufficiently thin to affect particle-wall contacts, making the paste friction coefficient tunable. Our results so offer potential pathways for reducing energy consumption and even extrusion product composition and failure.

Title: Understanding and predicting trends in adsorption energetics on monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Brian H. Lee, Jameela Fatheema, Deji Akinwande, Wennie Wang
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently been shown to demonstrate non-volatile resistive switching (NVRS), offering significant advantages such as high-density integration and low energy consumption due to their atomic-scale thinness. In this study, we focus on the adsorption and desorption of metal adatoms, which can modulate the electrical resistivity by several orders of magnitude. We develop material-based relationships of the adsorption energy with electronic and atomic structure descriptors by examining the effects of various transition-metal adsorbates on the surface of TMDs. Our results reveal that adsorption energies of transition metals exhibit consistent trends across different TMDs (MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, WSe$_2$) and can be explained using simple descriptors of the atomic and electronic structure. We propose several models to describe this adsorption process, providing a deeper understanding of a crucial step in the resistive switching mechanism based on formation and dissolution of point defects. Finally, we connect our computed adsorption energies to the switching energy. These findings will help guide rational materials selection for the development of NVRS devices using 2D TMDs.

Title: Confined density of states, quantum concentration, and electron degeneracy pressure in low-dimensional systems
Authors: Benedick Andrade, Rayda Gammag
Abstract: We present a simple derivation of the density of states (DOS) in confined nanomaterials. While previous studies often apply a heuristic $L^{3-d}$ confinement factor to bulk DOS expressions, we show that this factor arises naturally from a consistent quantum-mechanical treatment of quasi-dimensional systems. Using a Fermi gas model, we calculate carrier concentration in across different dimensions and introduce the concept of quantum concentration $n_Q$ as a statistical threshold for quantum confinement effect. We further demonstrate that the electron degeneracy pressure -- scaling with $n^{(d+2)/d}$ -- provides a thermodynamic explanation for carrier enhancement under quantum confinement. Our results clarify the origin of DOS modification and provide insights for low-dimensional materials.

Title: Microwave power and chamber pressure studies for single-crystalline diamond film growth using microwave plasma CVD
Authors: Truong Thi Hien, Jaesung Park, Cuong Manh Nguyen, Jeong Hyun Shim, Sangwon Oh
Abstract: Single-crystalline diamond (SCD) films possess exceptional thermal, chemical, and optical properties, making them ideal for advanced applications. However, achieving uniform film quality via microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) remains challenging due to spatial variations in plasma characteristics. This study systematically examines the influence of microwave power and chamber pressure on the growth of SCD films using CH4/H2 gas mixtures. Under optimized conditions (3,900 W, 120 Torr), the films exhibit low surface roughness (~2.0 nm), a sharp sp3 Raman peak at 1,332.2 cm-1, and no detectable C-H related features, indicating high crystalline purity. Cross-sectional TEM analysis confirms a uniform (100)-oriented single-crystal structure across the entire sample. These findings advance the understanding of the interplay between deposition parameters and film quality, and establish a more robust foundation for optimizing MPCVD processes in large-area, high-purity diamond fabrication.

Title: Phase transition from Weyl to self-linked semimetal using bi-circular laser
Authors: Debashree Chowdhury
Abstract: The Fermi surface topology of a triple non-hermitian (NH) Weyl semimetal (WSM) driven by bi-circularly polarized light is presented in this study. A NH WSM in particular has remarkable outlines. Bi-circular light, however, modifies the symmetry features of non-hermitian triple Weyl and causes an unusual new kind of band swapping. We observe swapping between the imaginary bands (with or without exceptional degenaracies), which causes unique Fermi surfaces in the form of double rings and knots. This is something never discussed before phase transition between Weyl and knotted phases. We also discuss the corresponding changes in the Berry curvature as well.

Title: Quantum anomalous Hall crystals in moiré bands with higher Chern number
Authors: Raul Perea-Causin, Hui Liu, Emil J. Bergholtz
Abstract: The realization of fractional Chern insulators in moiré materials has sparked the search for further novel phases of matter in this platform. In particular, recent works have demonstrated the possibility of realizing quantum anomalous Hall crystals (QAHCs), which combine the zero-field quantum Hall effect with spontaneously broken discrete translation symmetry. Here, we employ exact diagonalization to demonstrate the existence of stable QAHCs arising from $\frac{2}{3}$-filled moiré bands with Chern number $C=2$. Our calculations show that these topological crystals, which are characterized by a quantized Hall conductivity of $1$ (in units of $e^2/h$) and a tripled unit cell, are robust in an ideal model of twisted bilayer-trilayer graphene -- providing a novel explanation for experimental observations in this heterostructure. Furthermore, we predict that the QAHC remains robust in a realistic model of twisted double bilayer graphene and, in addition, we provide a range of optimal tuning parameters, namely twist angle and electric field, for experimentally realizing this phase. Overall, our work demonstrates the stability of QAHCs at odd-denominator filling of $C=2$ bands, provides specific guidelines for future experiments, and establishes chiral multilayer graphene as a theoretical platform for studying topological phases beyond the Landau-level paradigm.

Title: Orbital Optical Raman Lattice

Abstract: Spin and orbital are two basic degrees of freedom that play significant roles in exploring exotic quantum phases in optical lattices with synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and high orbital bands, respectively. Here, we combine these two crucial ingredients for the first time by proposing a completely new orbital optical Raman lattice scheme to explore exotic high-orbital Bose condensates with Raman-induced SOC in a square lattice. We find that both the SOC and p-orbital interactions influence the condensed state of bosons. Their interplay results in two novel high-orbital many-body quantum phases: the uniform angular momentum superfluid phase, which exhibits a global topological chiral orbital current characterized by a uniform Chern number, and the two-dimensional topological spin-orbital supersolid phase, which is characterized by the spin and orbital angular momentum density wave patterns and topological excitations with opposite Chern numbers, respectively protecting the chiral and antichiral edge modes in the neighboring supersolid clusters. Our scheme may open a new avenue for exploring exotic SOC and high-orbital physics in optical lattices, and is expected to advance the experimental realization of novel supersolids in higher dimensions.

Title: Universality of Top Rank Statistics for Brownian Reshuffling
Authors: Zdzislaw Burda, Mario Kieburg
Abstract: We study the dynamical aspects of the top rank statistics of particles, performing Brownian motions on a half-line, which are ranked by their distance from the origin. For this purpose, we introduce an observable that we call the overlap ratio $\Omega(t)$, whose average is the probability that a particle that is on the top-$n$ list at some time will also be on the top-$n$ list after time $t$. The overlap ratio is a local observable which is concentrated at the top of the ranking and does not require the full ranking of all particles. It is simple to measure in practice. We derive an analytical formula for the average overlap ratio for a system of $N$ particles in the stationary state that undergo independent Brownian motion on the positive real half-axis with a reflecting wall at the origin and a drift towards the wall. In particular, we show that for $N\rightarrow \infty$, the overlap ratio takes a rather simple form $\langle \Omega(t)\rangle = {\rm erfc}(a \sqrt{t})$ for $n\gg 1$ with some scaling parameter $a>0$. This result is a very good approximation even for moderate sizes of the top-$n$ list such as $n=10$. Moreover, as we show, the overlap ratio exhibits universal behavior observed in many dynamical systems including geometric Brownian motion, Brownian motion with a position-dependent drift and a soft barrier on one side, the Bouchaud-Mézard wealth distribution model, and Kesten processes.

Title: Enhanced Condensation Through Rotation
Authors: Maxim Chernodub, Frank Wilczek
Abstract: We argue that rotation of a thin superconducting cylinder in the presence of a magnetic field can increase the critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition substantially. The phenomenon originates from interaction energy of the dipole magnetic moment of the normal component with the background magnetic field, which encourages the formation of condensate that decouples from mechanical rotation. We give quantitative estimates for a thin cylinder of aluminum.

Title: Stability of co-annular active and passive confined fluids
Authors: Tanumoy Dhar, Michael J. Shelley, David Saintillan
Abstract: The translation and shape deformations of a passive viscous Newtonian droplet immersed in an active nematic liquid crystal under circular confinement are analyzed using a linear stability analysis. We focus on the case of a sharply aligned active nematic in the limit of strong elastic relaxation in two dimensions. Using an active liquid crystal model, we employ the Lorentz reciprocal theorem for Stokes flow to study the growth of interfacial perturbations as a result of both active and elastic stresses. Instabilities are uncovered in both extensile and contractile systems, for which growth rates are calculated and presented in terms of the dimensionless ratios of active, elastic, and capillary stresses, as well as the viscosity ratio between the two fluids. We also extend our theory to analyze the inverse scenario, namely, the stability of an active nematic droplet surrounded by a passive viscous layer. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of capillary, active, elastic, and viscous stresses in governing droplet stability. The instabilities uncovered here may be relevant to a plethora of biological active systems, from the dynamics of passive droplets in bacterial suspensions to the organization of subcellular compartments inside the cell and cell nucleus.

Title: Impact of electron beam propagation on high-resolution quantitative chemical analysis of 1 nm-wide GaN/AlGaN quantum wells
Authors: Florian Castioni, Patrick Quéméré, Sergi Cuesta, Vincent Delaye, Pascale Bayle-Guillemaud, Eva Monroy, Eric Robin, Nicolas Bernier
Abstract: Recent advancements in high-resolution spectroscopy analyses within the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) have paved the way for measuring the concentration of chemical species in crystalline materials at the atomic scale. However, several artifacts complicate the direct interpretation of experimental data. For instance, in the case of energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, the linear dependency of local x-ray emission on composition is disrupted by channeling effects and cross-talk during electron beam propagation. To address these challenges, it becomes necessary to adopt an approach that combines experimental data with inelastic scattering simulations. This method aims to account for the effects of electron beam propagation on x-ray emission, essentially determining the quantity and the spatial origin of the collected signal. In this publication, we propose to assess the precision and sensitivity limits of this approach in a practical case study involving a focused ion beam (FIB)-prepared III-N multilayers device. The device features nominally pure ~1.5-nm wide GaN quantum wells surrounded by AlGaN barriers containing a low concentration of aluminum (~5 at. %). By employing atomic-scale EDX acquisitions based on the averaging of more than several thousand frames, calibrated $\zeta$-factors combined with a multi-layer x-ray absorption correction model for quantification, and by comparing the x-ray radiation obtained from the quantum well with a reference 10-nm thick structure, we demonstrate that the quantitative impact of beam propagation on chemical composition can be precisely accounted for, resulting in a composition sensitivity at the atomic scale as low as +-0.25 at.%. Finally, practical aspects to achieve this high precision level are discussed, particularly in terms of inelastic multislice simulation, uncertainty determination, and sample quality.

Title: Exact solution to a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook-type equation for quantum lattice gases with dephasing noise
Authors: Michele Coppola
Abstract: The mean-state dynamics of free fermions subject to random projective measurements of local occupation number operators is governed by a Lindblad equation with dephasing noise. In the continuum limit, the equation of motion for the correlation matrix is mapped to a kinetic equation for the Wigner function, which corresponds to a special case of the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) equation without energy conservation. Our main result is the solution to the kinetic equation, showing that the Wigner dynamics emerges from stochastic sampling of classical run-and-tumble processes. As an application, we recover the crossover between ballistic and diffusive transport regimes.

Title: Monolithic 4H-SiC nanomechanical resonators with high intrinsic quality factors
Authors: A. Hochreiter, P. Bredol, F. David, B. Demiralp, H. B. Weber, E. M. Weig
Abstract: We present an extensive study of 4H-SiC nanomechanical resonators electrochemically etched out of a monocrystalline wafer. Combining piezo-driven interferometric determination of the mechanical spectra with scanning-laser-Doppler vibrometry, an unambiguous assignment of resonance peaks to flexural and torsional modes is achieved. The investigation of multiple harmonic eigenmodes of singly and doubly clamped resonators with varying geometry allows for a comprehensive characterization. Excellent intrinsic mechanical quality factors up to $2\times10^5$ are found at room temperature, approaching the thermoelastic limit at eigenfrquencies exceeding 10 MHz. Mechanical stress is essentially absent. Young's modulus in agreement with literature. These findings are robust under post-processing treatments, in particular atomic layer etching and high-temperature thermal annealing. The resulting on-chip high-quality mechanical resonators represent a valuable technological element for a broad range of applications. In particular, the monolithic architecture meets the requirements of spin-based photonic quantum technologies on the upcoming SiC platform.

Title: Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations for Coherent Transport
Authors: Kay Brandner, Keiji Saito
Abstract: We derive a universal thermodynamic uncertainty relation for Fermionic coherent transport, which bounds the total rate of entropy production in terms of the mean and fluctuations of a single particle current. This bound holds for any multi-terminal geometry and arbitrary chemical and thermal biases, as long as no external magnetic fields are applied. It can further be saturated in two-terminal settings with boxcar-shaped transmission functions and reduces to its classical counterpart in linear response. Upon insertion of a numerical factor, our bound also extends to systems with broken time-reversal symmetry. As an application, we derive trade-off relations between the figures of merit of coherent thermoelectric heat engines and refrigerators, which show that such devices can attain ideal efficiency only at vanishing mean power or diverging power fluctuations. To illustrate our results, we work out a model of a coherent conductor consisting of a chain of quantum dots.

Title: Navigating chemical design spaces for metal-ion batteries via machine-learning-guided phase-field simulations
Authors: Hamed Taghavian, Viktor Vanoppen, Erik Berg, Peter Broqvist, Jens Sjölund
Abstract: Metal anodes provide the highest energy density in batteries. However, they still suffer from electrode/electrolyte interface side reactions and dendrite growth, especially under fast-charging conditions. In this paper, we consider a phase-field model of electrodeposition in metal-anode batteries and provide a scalable, versatile framework for optimizing its chemical parameters. Our approach is based on Bayesian optimization and explores the parameter space with a high sample efficiency and a low computation complexity. We use this framework to find the optimal cell for suppressing dendrite growth and accelerating charging speed under constant voltage. We identify interfacial mobility as a key parameter, which should be maximized to inhibit dendrites without compromising the charging speed. The results are verified using extended simulations of dendrite evolution in charging half cells with lithium-metal anodes.

Title: Orbitronics in Two-dimensional Materials
Authors: Tarik P. Cysne, Luis M. Canonico, Marcio Costa, R. B. Muniz, Tatiana G. Rappoport
Abstract: Orbitronics explores the control and manipulation of electronic orbital angular momentum in solid-state systems, opening new pathways for information processing and storage. One significant advantage of orbitronics over spintronics is that it does not rely on spin-orbit coupling, thereby broadening the range of non-magnetic materials that can be utilized for these applications. It also introduces new topological features related to electronic orbital angular momentum, and clarifies some long-standing challenges in understanding experiments that rely on the conventional concept of valley transport. This review highlights recent advances in orbitronics, particularly in relation to two-dimensional materials. We examine the fundamental principles underlying the generation, transport, and dynamics of orbital angular momentum to illustrate how the unique properties of two-dimensional materials can promote orbitronic phenomena. We also outline potential future research directions and address some outstanding questions in this field.

Title: Understanding phonon selection and interference in momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy
Authors: Thomas W. Pfeifer, Harrison A. Walker, Henry T. Aller, Samuel Graham, Sokrates Pantelides, Jordan A. Hachtel, Patrick E. Hopkins, Eric R. Hoglund
Abstract: As momentum-resolved Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (q-EELS) becomes more widely used for phonon measurements, better understanding of the intricacies of the acquired signal is necessary. Selection rules limit the allowed scattering, which may prohibit the appearance of specific phonon branches for certain measurements. Simultaneous sampling of the lattice across all basis indices also warrants a coherent treatment of phonons, which yields a larger repeating unit in reciprocal space. We thus introduce the concept of the ``interferometric Brillouin zone'', which is closely related to the Dynamic Structure Factor. Both effects determine where phonon modes may be observed. Through a rigorous understanding of both, we introduce a new efficient method of simulation of scattering experiments via Spectral Energy Density (SED) and/or Lattice Dynamics (LD) calculations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of scattering selection rules on well-studied systems and explore the acquisition of a polarization-selective vibrational density of states.

Title: Dynamical response theory of interacting Majorana fermions and its application to generic Kitaev quantum spin liquids in a field
Authors: Peng Rao, Roderich Moessner, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: Motivated by the appearance of Majorana fermions in a broad range of correlated and topological electronic systems, we develop a general method to compute the dynamical response of interacting Majorana fermions in the random-phase approximation (RPA). This can be applied self-consistently on top of Majorana mean-field theory (MFT) backgrounds, thereby in particular providing a powerful tool to analyse $\textit{generic}$ behaviour in the vicinity of (various heavily studied) exactly soluble models. Prime examples are quantum spin liquids (QSL) with emergent Majorana excitations, with the celebrated exact solution of Kitaev. We employ the RPA to study in considerable detail phase structure and dynamics of the extended Kitaev honeycomb $KJ\Gamma$-model, with and without an applied field. First, we benchmark our method with Kitaev's exactly soluble model, finding a remarkable agreement. The interactions between Majorana fermions even turn out to mimic the effect of local $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux excitations, which we explain analytically. Second, we show how small non-Kitaev couplings $J$ and $\Gamma$ induce Majorana bound states, resulting in sharp features in the dynamical structure factor in the presence of fractionalisation: such 'spinon excitons' naturally appear, and can coexist and interact with the broad Majorana continuum. Third, for increasing couplings or field, our theory predicts instabilities of the KQSL triggered by the condensation of the sharp modes. From the high symmetry momenta of the condensation we can deduce which magnetically ordered phases surround the KQSL, in good agreement with previous finite-size numerics. We discuss implications for experiments and the broad range of applicability of our method to other QSL and Majorana systems.

Title: Jeff = 1/2 Diamond Magnet CaCo2TeO6: A Pathway toward New Spin Physics and Quantum Functions
Authors: Xudong Huai, Luke Pritchard Cairns, Bridget Delles, Michal J. Winiarski, Maurice Sorolla II, Xinshu Zhang, Youzhe Chen, Stuart Calder, Tatenda Kanyowa, Anshul Kogar, Huibo Cao, Danielle Yahne, Robert Birgeneau, James Analytis, Thao T. Tran
Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.

Title: Chemo-mechanical motility modes of partially wetting liquid droplets
Authors: Florian Voss, Uwe Thiele
Abstract: We consider a simple thermodynamically consistent model that captures the self-organized chemo-mechanical coupling resulting from the interplay between autocatalytically reacting surfactants, the Marangoni effect and wetting dynamics. An ambient bath of surfactant acts as a chemostat and provides the system with chemical fuel, thereby driving it away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that a positive feedback loop between the local reactions and the Marangoni effect induces surface tension gradients that allow for self-propelled droplets. Besides simple directional motion, we find crawling and shuttling droplets as well as droplets performing random walks, thus exploring the entire substrate. We study the occurring chemo-mechanical motility modes and show how the observed dynamic states emerge from local and global bifurcations. Due to the underlying generic thermodynamic structure, we expect that our results are relevant not only to directly related biomimetic droplet systems but also to structurally similar systems like chemically active phase-separating mixtures.

Title: A temperature dependent framework to predict and control physical pellet quality in biomass extrusion
Authors: Richard T. Benders, Joshua A. Dijksman, Thomas M. M. Bastiaansen, Raoul Fix, Jasper van der Gucht, Menno Thomas
Abstract: Pellet manufacturing of biomass (food, feed, bioenergy) presses powders or particles into dense pellets with improved nutritional, calorific, and handling properties. This process upgrades industrial co-products from agriculture, forestry, and bioenergy into higher-value products. However, processing particulate streams raises the scientific question: Under which conditions do loose particles bind to form rigid, durable pellets? This work answers this question for biomass extrusion. Systematic experiments reveal how steam conditioning temperature, production rate, and die geometry interact to determine pellet quality. We propose an overarching framework introducing the stickiness temperature ($T^*$), marking the onset of enthalpic reactions required for particle agglomeration. $T^*$ serves as the boundary for inter-particle bond formation and is reached through a combination of steam conditioning and friction, both controllable via process parameters. Results highlight the combined role of pellet temperature and die residence time in optimizing pellet durability while lowering specific energy use (J/kg). Validation with experiments and literature confirms that this framework offers practical guidance to enhance efficiency and sustainability of pelleting. By providing operational parameters to control bonding and energy input, this work supports a more circular economy through efficient conversion of diverse biomass streams into valuable products while reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

Title: Evanescent Orbital Pumping by Magnetization Dynamics Without Spin-Orbit Coupling
Authors: Chengyuan Cai, Hanchen Wang, Tao Yu
Abstract: Converting magnetization spin to orbital current often relies on strong spin-orbit interaction that may cause additional angular momentum dissipation. We report that coherent magnetization dynamics in magnetic nanostructures can evanescently pump an orbital current into adjacent semiconductors due to the coupling between its stray electromagnetic field and electron orbitals without relying on spin-orbit coupling. The underlying photonic spin of the electromagnetic field governs the orbital polarization that flows along the gradient of the driven field. Due to the orbital texture, the orbital Hall current that flows perpendicularly to the gradient of the AC field is also generated and does not suffer from the orbital torque. These findings extend the paradigm of orbital pumping to include photonic spin and pave the way for developing low-dissipation orbitronic devices.

Title: Experimental Observation of Single- and Multi-Site Matter-Wave Solitons in 1D Optical Lattices
Authors: Robbie Cruickshank, Francesco Lorenzi, Arthur La Rooij, Ethan Kerr, Timon Hilker, Stefan Kuhr, Luca Salasnich, Elmar Haller
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of discrete bright matter-wave solitons with attractive interaction in an optical lattice. Using an accordion lattice with adjustable spacing, we prepare a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms across a defined number of lattice sites. By quenching the interaction strength and the trapping potential, we generate both single-site and multi-site solitons. Our results reveal the existence and characteristics of these solitons across a range of lattice depths and spacings. We identify stable regions of the solitons, based on interaction strength and lattice properties, and compare these findings with theoretical predictions. The experimental results qualitatively agree with a Gaussian variational model and match quantitatively with numerical simulations of the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, extended with a quintic term to account for the loss of atoms. Our results provide insights into the quench dynamics and collapse mechanisms, paving the way for further studies on transport and dynamical properties of matter-wave solitons in lattices.

Title: Crossover in Electronic Specific Heat near Narrow-Sense Type-III Dirac Cones
Authors: Keita Kishigi, Yasumasa Hasegawa
Abstract: Two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions exhibit Dirac cones, which are classified into three types: type-I, type-II, and type-III. In both type-I and type-II cones, the energy dispersion is linear in all momentum directions. Type-I cones are characterized by a non-overtilted structure, where the Dirac point serves as a local minimum (maximum) for the upper (lower) band. In contrast, type-II cones exhibit overtilted dispersions, leading to the coexistence of electron and hole pockets. At the critical tilt, the linear energy dispersion vanishes in one momentum direction, corresponding to a type-III Dirac cone. We further define a special case, termed the "narrow-sense" type-III cone, where not only the linear term but also quadratic and higher-order terms vanish, resulting in a completely flat dispersion along one direction. In this work, we numerically investigate the temperature ($T$) -dependence of the electronic specific heat ($C$), as the Dirac cone is continuously tilted from type-I to narrow-sense type-III. A model with particle-hole symmetry is employed to ensure that the chemical potential ($\mu$) remains temperature independent. Our results reveal a notable crossover in $C$ near narrow-sense type-III, where $C$ changes from $C \propto T^{2}$ below the crossover temperature ($T_{\rm co}$) to $C \propto T^{\frac{1}{2}}$ above $T_{\rm co}$. This crossover is attributed to the energy-dependent structure of the density of states. The present findings suggest a feasible approach for experimentally probing the degree of Dirac cone tilting near the narrow-sense type-III limit.

Title: Chiral Locking of Magnon Flow and Electron Spin Accumulation in Their Near-Field Radiative Spin Transfer
Authors: Xi-Han Zhou, Xiyin Ye, Tao Yu
Abstract: We report a non-contact mechanism for directional injection of magnons in magnetic films when driven by a spin accumulation $\pmb{\mu}_s$ of electrons of a nearby metallic layer, governed by the long-range dipolar coupling between magnons and electron spins, which spontaneously generates a magnon current ${\bf J}_m$ flowing in the film plane. Crucially, in such near-field radiative spin transfer, the magnon flow ${\bf J}_m$ is always perpendicular to the spin accumulation $\pmb{\mu}_s$, showing a universal chiral locking relation. The spin injection is efficient even when $\pmb{\mu}_s$ is parallel to the magnetization, a feature breaking the limitation of the spin transfer by contact exchange interaction. Our findings reveal the critical role of dipolar chirality in driving the magnon thermal current and paving the way for the functional design of magnonic devices based on near-field radiative spin transfer.

Title: Super Moiré Domain Tessellations, Sliding Ferroelectricity and Reconfigurable Quantum Dot Arrays in Twisted Trilayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Kunihiro Yananose, Changwon Park, Young-Woo Son
Abstract: At very small twist angles, bilayer moiré systems exhibit characteristic stacking domain patterns, where the moiré length scale is determined solely by the twist angle. In contrast, the additional stacking and twisting degrees of freedom in twisted trilayer systems give rise to richer and more intricate domain tessellations. In twisted trilayer hexagonal boron nitride (TTBN), the interplay between polar and nonpolar domains and their domain walls is shown to result in unconventional responses to external electric fields, including electric-field tunability of the moiré-of-moiré or super moiré pattern - features absent in bilayer counterparts. We demonstrate that at the vertices of super moiré domains, TTBN can support arrays of quantum dots hosting localized quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) states with diverse spatial symmetries. Futhermore, we show that the shape of the array and the spacing between the localized QHO states can be dynamically reconfigured by electric fields, enabling facile switching between fully isolated and strongly coupled regimes. The local potentials for the quantum dot state are predicted to be sufficiently deep to support a series of QHO states with nonzero angular momentum. This tunability enables control over the transport of quantum dot states and their inter-dot coupling, facillitating long-range quantum state transfer. Combined with the feasibility of large-scale fabrication of homogeneous twisted trilayer materials, these properties position TTBN as a promising platform for a wide range of quantum technologies.

Title: Leveraging Modified Ex Situ Tomography Data for Segmentation of In Situ Synchrotron X-Ray Computed Tomography
Authors: Tristan Manchester, Adam Anders, Julio Spadotto, Hannah Eccleston, William Beavan, Hugues Arcis, Brian J. Connolly
Abstract: In situ synchrotron X-ray computed tomography enables dynamic material studies. However, automated segmentation remains challenging due to complex imaging artefacts - like ring and cupping effects - and limited training data. We present a methodology for deep learning-based segmentation by transforming high-quality ex situ laboratory data to train models for segmentation of in situ synchrotron data, demonstrated through a metal oxide dissolution study. Using a modified SegFormer architecture, our approach achieves segmentation performance (94.7% IoU) that matches human inter-annotator reliability (94.6% IoU). This indicates the model has reached the practical upper bound for this task, while reducing processing time by 2 orders of magnitude per 3D dataset compared to manual segmentation. The method maintains robust performance over significant morphological changes during experiments, despite training only on static specimens. This methodology can be readily applied to diverse materials systems, enabling the efficient analysis of the large volumes of time-resolved tomographic data generated in typical in situ experiments across scientific disciplines.

Title: Topotactical Hydrogen Induced Single-Band $d$-wave Superconductivity in La$_2$NiO$_4$
Authors: Ying Gao, Wenfeng Wu, Zhaoxin Liu, Karsten Held, Liang Si
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_4$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a structural resemblance to its cuprate counterpart, La$_2$CuO$_4$. However, La$_2$CuO$_4$ has a Cu$^{2+}$ or 3$d^9$ electronic configuration that needs to be hole or electron doped for superconductivity, whereas La$_2$NiO$_4$ is 3$d^8$ with divalent Ni$^{2+}$. Making a cuprate analog through conventional electron doping is impractical due to the rarity of tetravalent substituents for trivalent La. Here, we propose an alternative route: intercalating topotactical hydrogen, which is possible through electric-field-controlled protonation and transforms La$_2$NiO$_4$ into a 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ single-band two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Mott insulator analogous to La$_2$CuO$_4$. This we find through density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations. The furthergoing dynamical vertex approximation predicts that H-La$_2$NiO$_4$ can host $d$-wave superconductivity under 15\% hole doping with a critical temperature above 20\,K. Our findings not only suggest a new method for tuning the electronic structure of layered nickelates but also provide theoretical evidence for a new nickelate superconductor, awaiting experimental synthesis.

Title: Effect of Magnetic Anisotropy and Gradient-Induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction on the Formation of Magnetic Skyrmions
Authors: Adam Erickson, Qihan Zhang, Hamed Vakili, Edward Schwartz, Suvechhya Lamichhane, Chaozhong Li, Boyu Li, Dongsheng Song, Guozhi Chai, Sy-Hwang Liou, Alexey A. Kovalev, Jingsheng Chen, Abdelghani Laraoui
Abstract: Topological spin textures (e.g. skyrmions) can be stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in the magnetic multilayer, which has been intensively studied. Recently, Bloch-type magnetic skyrmions stabilized by composition gradient-induced DMI (g-DMI) have been observed in 10-nm thick CoPt single layer. However, magnetic anisotropy in gradient-composition engineered CoPt (g-CoPt) films is highly sensitive to both the relative Co/Pt composition and the film thickness, leading to a complex interplay with g-DMI. The stability of skyrmions under the combined influence of magnetic anisotropy and g-DMI is crucial yet remains poorly understood. Here, we conduct a systematic study on the characteristics of magnetic skyrmions as a function of gradient polarity and effective gradient (defined as gradient/thickness) in g-CoPt single layers (thickness of 10-30 nm) using magnetic force microscopy (MFM), bulk magnetometry, and topological Hall effect measurements. Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy confirms that both the sign and magnitude of g-DMI depend on the polarity and amplitude of the composition gradient in g-CoPt films. MFM reveals that skyrmion size and density vary with g-CoPt film thickness, gradient polarity, and applied magnetic field. An increased skyrmion density is observed in samples exhibiting higher magnetic anisotropy, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations and energy barrier calculations.

Title: Accurate Prediction of Tensorial Spectra Using Equivariant Graph Neural Network
Authors: Ting-Wei Hsu, Zhenyao Fang, Arun Bansil, Qimin Yan
Abstract: Optical spectroscopies provide a powerful tool for harnessing light-matter interactions for unraveling complex electronic features such as the flat bands and nontrivial topologies of materials. These insights are crucial for the development and optimization of optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, where device performance is closely connected with the nature of the underlying electronic spectrum. Realistic modeling of tensor optical responses in materials, which are computationally quite demanding, however, remains challenging. Here we introduce the Tensorial Spectra Equivariant Neural Network (TSENN), which is a equivariant graph neural network architecture that maps crystal structures directly to their full photon-frequency-dependent optical tensors. By encoding the isotropic sequential scalar components along with the anisotropic sequential tensor components into l = 0 and l = 2 spherical tensor components, TSENN ensures symmetry-aware predictions that are consistent with the constraints of crystalline symmetries of materials. Trained on a dataset of frequency-dependent permittivity tensors of 1,432 bulk semiconductors computed using first-principles methods, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 21.181 millifarads per meter (mF/m), demonstrating its potential for efficient modeling of other related properties such as the optical conductivities. Our framework opens new avenues for rational data-driven design of anisotropic optical responses for accelerating materials discovery for advancing optoelectronic applications.

Title: Inferring activity from the flow field around active colloidal particles using deep learning
Authors: Aditya Mohapatra, Aditya Kumar, Mayurakshi Deb, Siddharth Dhomkar, Rajesh Singh
Abstract: Active colloidal particles create flow around them due to non-equilibrium process on their surfaces. In this paper, we infer the activity of such colloidal particles from the flow field created by them via deep learning. We first explain our method for one active particle, inferring the $2s$ mode (or the stresslet) and the $3t$ mode (or the source dipole) from the flow field data, along with the position and orientation of the particle. We then apply the method to a system of many active particles. We find excellent agreements between the predictions and the true values of activity. Our method presents a principled way to predict arbitrary activity from the flow field created by active particles.

Title: Nitrogen-Vacancy Magnetometry of Edge Magnetism in WS2 Flakes

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnets are of significant interest both as a platform for exploring novel fundamental physics and for their potential in spintronic and optoelectronic devices. Recent bulk magnetometry studies have indicated a weak ferromagnetic response in WS2, and theoretical predictions suggest edge-localized magnetization in flakes with partial hydrogenation. Here, we use room-temperature wide-field quantum diamond magnetometry to image pristine and Fe-implanted WS2 flakes of varying thicknesses (45-160 nm), exfoliated from bulk crystals and transferred to NV-doped diamond substrates. We observe direct evidence of edge-localized stray magnetic fields, which scale linearly with applied external magnetic field (4.4-220 mT), reaching up to 4.7 uT. The edge signal shows a limited dependence on the flake thickness, consistent with dipolar field decay and sensing geometry. Magnetic simulations using five alternative models favor the presence of edge magnetization aligned along an axis slightly tilted from the normal to the WS2 flake plane, consistent with spin canting in antiferromagnetically coupled edge states. Our findings establish WS2 as a promising platform for edge-controlled 2D spintronics.

Title: Higher order Jacobi method for solving system of linear equations
Authors: Nithin Kumar Goona, Lama Tarsissi
Abstract: This work proposes a higher-order iterative framework for solving matrix equations, inspired by the structure and functionality of neural networks. A modification of the classical Jacobi iterative method is introduced to compute higher-order coefficient matrices through matrix-matrix multiplications. The resulting method, termed the higher order Jacobi method (HOJM), structurally resembles a shallow linear network and allows direct computation of the inverse of the coefficient matrix. Building on this, an iterative scheme is developed that allows efficient resolution of system variations without recomputing the coefficients, once the network parameters are trained for a known system. This iterative process naturally assumes the form of a deep recurrent neural network. The proposed approach goes beyond conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) by providing an explicit, training-free definition of network parameters rooted in physical and mathematical formulations. Computational analysis on GPU reveals significant enhancement in the order of complexity, highlighting a compelling and transformative direction for advancing algorithmic efficiency in solving linear systems. This methodology opens avenues for interpretable and scalable solutions to physically motivated problems in computational science.

Title: Expressivity of determinantal anzatzes for neural network wave functions
Authors: Ni Zhan, William A. Wheeler, Gil Goldshlager, Elif Ertekin, Ryan P. Adams, Lucas K. Wagner
Abstract: Neural network wave functions have shown promise as a way to achieve high accuracy on the many-body quantum problem. These wave functions most commonly use a determinant or sum of determinants to antisymmetrize many-body orbitals which are described by a neural network. In many cases, the wave function is projected onto a fixed-spin state. Such a treatment is allowed for spin-independent operators; however, it cannot be applied to spin-dependent problems, such as Hamiltonians containing spin-orbit interactions. We show that for spin-independent Hamiltonians, a strict upper bound property is obeyed between a traditional Hartree-Fock like determinant, full spinor wave function, the full determinant wave function, and a generalized spinor wave function. The relationship between a spinor wave function and the full determinant arises because the full determinant wave function is the spinor wave function projected onto a fixed-spin, after which antisymmetry is implicitly restored in the spin-independent case. For spin-dependent Hamiltonians, the full determinant wave function is not applicable, because it is not antisymmetric. Numerical experiments on the H$_3$ molecule and two-dimensional homogeneous electron gas confirm the bounds.

Title: Role of interaction anisotropy in polymer cononsolvency: insights from the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework
Authors: Satyen Dhamankar, Michael A. Webb
Abstract: Cononsolvency occurs when mixing two good solvents creates poor-solvent conditions for polymers over specific composition ranges, causing macroscopic phase separation or microscopic chain collapse. Despite its technological and biophysical relevance, the connection between macroscopic and microscopic manifestations of cononsolvency remains unclear. A key challenge is identifying which interactions govern cononsolvency: coarse-grained analyses like standard Flory--Huggins models assume purely isotropic interactions, while atomistic simulations contain complex anisotropic interactions that cannot be precisely controlled or isolated. Here, we address the role of interaction anisotropy using the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework, which treats $\chi$ as a thermodynamic average over molecular orientations. This enables controlled comparison between systems with isotropic versus anisotropic interactions that share identical effective $\chi$ parameters, either driving cononsolvency by strong solvent-cosolvent affinity or preferential polymer-cosolvent affinity. While pairs of systems exhibit equivalent macroscopic phase behavior, lattice Monte Carlo simulations reveal that those featuring anisotropic interactions generate distinct collapse signatures, particularly in reentrant coil-globule transitions or characteristics of the solvation structure. These results demonstrate how microscopic interaction anisotropy influences cononsolvency behavior beyond what effective $\chi$ parameters alone predict.

Title: Hetero-Orbital Two-Component Fractional Quantum Hall States in Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Ke Huang, Ajit C. Balram, Hailong Fu, Chengqi Guo, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jainendra K. Jain, Jun Zhu
Abstract: A two-dimensional electron system exposed to a strong magnetic field produces a plethora of strongly interacting fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, the complex topological orders of which are revealed through exotic emergent particles, such as composite fermions, fractionally charged Abelian and non-Abelian anyons. Much insight has been gained by the study of multi-component FQH states, where spin and pseudospin indices of the electron contribute additional correlation. Traditional multi-component FQH states develop in situations where the components share the same orbital states and the resulting interactions are pseudospin independent; this homo-orbital nature was also crucial to their theoretical understanding. Here, we study "hetero-orbital" two-component FQH states, in which the orbital index is part of the pseudospin, rendering the multi-component interactions strongly SU(2) anisotropic in the pseudospin space. Such states, obtained in bilayer graphene at the isospin transition between N = 0 and N = 1 electron Landau levels, are markedly different from previous homo-orbital two-component FQH states. In particular, we observe strikingly different behaviors for the parallel-flux and reverse-flux composite fermion states, and an anomalously strong two-component 2/5 state over a wide range of magnetic field before it abruptly disappears at a high field. Our findings, combined with detailed theoretical calculations, reveal the surprising robustness of the hetero-orbital FQH effects, significantly enriching our understanding of FQH physics in this novel regime.

Title: Transfer-matrix approach to the Blume-Capel model on the triangular lattice
Authors: Dimitrios Mataragkas, Alexandros Vasilopoulos, Nikolaos G. Fytas, Dong-Hee Kim
Abstract: We investigate the spin-$1$ Blume-Capel model on an infinite strip of the triangular lattice using the transfer-matrix method combined with a sparse-matrix factorization technique. Through finite-size scaling analysis of numerically exact spectra for strip widths up to $L = 19$, we accurately locate the tricritical point improving upon recent Monte Carlo estimates. In the first-order regime, we observe exponential scaling of the spectral gap, reflecting the linear growth of interfacial tension as the temperature decreases below the tricritical point. Finally, we validate our tricritical point estimate through precise agreement with conformal field theory predictions for the tricritical Ising universality class. Our results underscore the continued utility of the transfer-matrix approach for studying phase transitions in complex lattice models.

Title: Intertwined Orders and the Physics of High Temperature Superconductors
Authors: Eduardo Fradkin
Abstract: Complex phase diagrams are generic feature of quantum materials that display high temperature superconductivity. In addition to d-wave superconductivity (or other unconventional states), these phase diagrams typically include various forms of charge-ordered phases, including charge-density-waves and/or spin-density waves, and electronic nematic states. In most cases these phases have critical temperatures comparable in magnitude to that of the superconducting state, and appear in a "pseudo-gap" regime. In these systems the high temperature state is not a good metal with well-defined quasiparticles but a "strange metal". These states typically arise from doping a strongly correlated Mott insulator. With my collaborators we have identified these behaviors as a problem with "Intertwined Orders". A Pair-density wave is a type of superconducting state which embodies the physics of intertwined orders. Here I discus the phenomenology of intertwined orders and the quantum materials that are known to display these behaviors.

Title: "Depletion" of Superfluid Density: Universal Low-temperature Thermodynamics of Superfluids
Authors: Viktor Berger, Nikolay Prokof'ev, Boris Svistunov
Abstract: Landau theory of superfluidity associates low-temperature flow of the normal component with the phonon wind. This picture does not apply to superfluids in which Galilean invariance is broken either by disorder, or porous media, or lattice potential, and the phonon wind is no longer responsible for depletion of the superfluid component. Based on Popov's hydrodynamic action with anharmonic terms, we present a general theory for temperature ($T$) dependence of the superfluid stiffness at low $T$, which reproduces Landau result as a special case when several parameters of the hydrodynamic action are fixed by the Galilean invariance. At the technical level, the theory of low-temperature depletion in a $d$-dimensional quantum superfluid maps onto the problem of finite-size ($L$) corrections in a $(d+1)$-dimensional anisotropic (pseudo-)classical-field system with U(1)-symmetric complex-valued action. We validate our theory with numeric simulations of interacting lattice bosons and the J-current model. In a broader context, our approach reveals universal low-temperature thermodynamics of superfluids with an intrinsic connection between finite-$T$ and finite-$L$ effects implying universal scaling, $T^{d+1}$ and $1/L^{d+1}$, respectively, for a large class of thermodynamic quantities.

Title: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain
Authors: Jingya Wang, Zenan Liu, Bin-Bin Mao, Xu Tian, Zijian Xiong, Zhe Wang, Zheng Yan
Abstract: It is generally believed that spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry is restricted by Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. A special case is that the 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain holds long-range order because the order parameter commutes with the Hamiltonian. The other one is that the recently found frustration-free Hamiltonians can bypass this theorem, but the observed symmetry breaking is fragile under generic perturbations. In this Letter, we have discovered a new example that goes beyond the above two examples-- a 1D antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on comb lattice -- that can achieve spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry. In addition to the long range order parameter, its energy spectrum shows Anderson tower of states. Importantly, it is not a frustration-free model and its order parameter does not commute with the Hamiltonian. Moreover, the long-range order is robust under symmetry-preserving perturbations. Combining numerical simulation and theoretical analysis, we have further confirmed and understood this nontrivial phenomenon.

Title: Spacetime symmetry-enriched SymTFT: from LSM anomalies to modulated symmetries and beyond
Authors: Salvatore D. Pace, Ömer M. Aksoy, Ho Tat Lam
Abstract: We extend the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) framework beyond internal symmetries by including geometric data that encode spacetime symmetries. Concretely, we enrich the SymTFT of an internal symmetry by spacetime symmetries and study the resulting symmetry-enriched topological (SET) order, which captures the interplay between the spacetime and internal symmetries. We illustrate the framework by focusing on symmetries in 1+1D. To this end, we first analyze how gapped boundaries of 2+1D SETs affect the enriching symmetry, and apply this within the SymTFT framework to gauging and detecting anomalies of the 1+1D symmetry, as well as to classifying 1+1D symmetry-enriched phases. We then consider quantum spin chains and explicitly construct the SymTFTs for three prototypical spacetime symmetries: lattice translations, spatial reflections, and time reversal. For lattice translations, the interplay with internal symmetries is encoded in the SymTFT by translations permuting anyons, which causes the continuum description of the SymTFT to be a foliated field theory. Using this, we elucidate the relation between Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies and modulated symmetries and classify modulated symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. For reflection and time-reversal symmetries, the interplay can additionally be encoded by symmetry fractionalization data in the SymTFT, and we identify mixed anomalies and study gauging for such examples.

Title: Chiral superconductivity near a fractional Chern insulator
Authors: Taige Wang, Michael P. Zaletel
Abstract: Superconductivity arising from fully spin-polarized, repulsively interacting electrons can host intrinsically chiral Cooper pairs and Majorana zero modes, yet no concrete microscopic route to such a state has been established. Motivated by recent observations in twisted homobilayer MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, where fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) appear adjacent to spin-valley-polarized superconductors, we investigate a minimal model: spinless electrons in the lowest Landau level subject to a tunable periodic potential. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations reveal that, as the FCI gap closes, two nearly degenerate phases emerge before the system turns metallic: a chiral $f$-wave superconductor and a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ charge-density wave (CDW) whose energies differ by less than $1\%$. These two competing states mirror the superconducting and re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) phases observed experimentally near the FCI regime. The superconducting dome survives realistic Coulomb interaction, light doping, and various lattice geometry. Melting the FCI therefore provides a new mechanism for realizing spin-polarized chiral superconductivity and RIQH order. We predict that twisted MoTe$_2$ at larger twist angles will develop a superconducting dome even at filling $\nu = 2/3$, and suppressing this superconductivity with a magnetic field should drive the system into an RIQH state.

Title: Quasiparticle band picture bridging topology and strong correlations across energy scales
Authors: Ivan Pasqua, Antonio Maria Tagliente, Gabriele Bellomia, Bartomeu Monserrat, Michele Fabrizio, Carlos Mejuto-Zaera
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between electronic correlations and band topology remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics, primarily hindered by a language mismatch problem. While band topology is naturally formulated within a single-particle band theory, strong correlations typically elude such an effective one-body description. In this work, we bridge this gap leveraging the ghost Gutzwiller (gGut) variational embedding framework, which introduces auxiliary quasiparticle degrees of freedom to recover an effective band structure description of strongly correlated systems. This approach enables an interpretable and computationally efficient treatment of correlated topological phases, resulting in energy- and momentum-resolved topological features that are directly comparable with experimental spectra. We exemplify the advantages of this framework through a detailed study of the interacting Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. Not only does the gGut description reproduce established results, but it also reveals previously inaccessible aspects: most notably, the emergence of topologically nontrivial Hubbard bands hosting their own edge states, as well as possible ways to manipulate these through a finite magnetization. These results position the gGut framework as a promising tool for the predictive modeling of correlated topological materials.

Title: Localization Transition for Interacting Quantum Particles in Colored-Noise Disorder
Authors: Giacomo Morpurgo, Laurent Sanchez-Palencia, Thierry Giamarchi
Abstract: We investigate the localization transition of interacting particles in a one-dimensional correlated disorder system. The disorder which we investigate allows for vanishing backwards scattering processes. We derive by two renormalization group procedures its phase diagram and predict that the localization transition point is shifted from finite attractive interaction to the non-interacting point. We finally show numerically that the scaling of the localization length with the disorder strength deviates from the usual scaling of a localized phase.

Title: Defect Interactions Through Periodic Boundaries in Two-Dimensional $p$-atics
Authors: Cody D. Schimming
Abstract: Periodic boundary conditions are a common theoretical and computational tool used to emulate effectively infinite domains. However, two-dimensional periodic domains are topologically distinct from the infinite plane, eliciting the question: How do periodic boundaries affect systems with topological properties themselves? In this work, I derive an analytical expression for the orientation fields of two-dimensional $p$-atic liquid crystals, systems with $p$-fold rotational symmetry, with topological defects in a flat domain subject to periodic boundary conditions. I show that this orientation field leads to an anomalous interaction between defects that deviates from the usual Coulomb interaction, which is confirmed through continuum simulations of nematic liquid crystals ($p = 2$). The interaction is understood as being mediated by non-singular topological solitons in the director field which are stabilized by the periodic boundary conditions. The results show the importance of considering domain topology, not only geometry, when analyzing interactions between topological defects.

Title: Suppression of the charge fluctuations by nonlocal correlations close to the Mott transition
Authors: Irakli Titvinidze, Julian Stobbe, Marvin Leusch, Georg Rohringer
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of nonlocal correlations on charge fluctuations in the two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model close to the Mott metal-to-insulator transition. At half-filling and for interaction strengths and temperatures where the system is in the Mott insulating phase, charge fluctuations are strongly suppressed. Under these conditions, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations predict a strong enhancement of the charge susceptibility at small (electron or hole) doping. However, these DMFT results include only the effects of purely local correlations despite the importance of nonlocal correlations in two-dimensional systems. We have, hence, carried out dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A) simulations which allow for the inclusion of such nonlocal correlation effects while retaining the local ones of DMFT. Our numerical data show that close to half-filling the large uniform charge susceptibility of DMFT is strongly suppressed by nonlocal fluctuations but gradually increases with (electron) doping. At a certain doping value, charge fluctuations eventually become larger in D$\Gamma$A with respect to DMFT indicating that the absence of nonlocal correlations underestimates the mobility of the charge carriers in this parameter regime. This metallization effect is also reflected in an enhancement of the D$\Gamma$A kinetic and potential energies and a corresponding reduction of the (absolute value of the) D$\Gamma$A Matsubara self-energy with respect to DMFT.

Title: Anyonic analogue of optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer
Authors: Navketan Batra, Zezhu Wei, Smitha Vishveshwara, D. E. Feldman
Abstract: Anyonic interferometry is a direct probe of fractional statistics. We propose an interferometry geometry that parallels an optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer and offers several advantages over existing interferometry schemes. In contrast to the currently studied electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer, our setup has no drain inside the device so that the trapped topological charge is time-independent. In contrast to electronic Fabry-Pérot interferometry, anyons cannot go around the device more than once. Thus, the interference signal has a straightforward interpretation in terms of anyonic statistical phases. The proposed geometry suppresses the undesirable effects of bulk-edge coupling. Moreover, the setup allows for simple exact solutions for the electric current and noise for an arbitrary quasiparticle tunneling strength in a broad range of conditions. The structure of the solutions is similar to that for non-interacting electrons but reflects fractional charge and statistics. We present results for electric current and noise in Jain states and address thermal interferometry at zero voltage bias.

Title: Designing Two-Dimensional Octuple-Atomic-Layer M$_2$A$_2$Z$_4$ as Promising Photocatalysts for Overall Water Splitting
Authors: Dingyanyan Zhou, Yujin Ji, Mir F. Mousavi, Youyong Li
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates as photocatalytic materials due to their large surface areas and tunable electronic properties. In this work, we systematically design and screen a series of octuple-atomic-layer M$_2$A$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers (M = Al, Ga, In; A = Si, Ge, Sn; Z = N, P, As) using first-principles calculations. 108 structures are constructed by intercalation approach, followed by a comprehensive evaluation of their thermodynamic and dynamic stability, band gaps, and band edge alignments to assess their potential for photocatalytic overall water splitting. Among them, eight candidates meet the criteria for overall water splitting under acidic condition (pH = 0), and Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$, further exhibit suitable band edge positions for photocatalysis under both acidic and neutral environments (pH = 0 and 7). Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$ also show pronounced visible-light absorption and structural stability in aqueous conditions. Importantly, the introduction of N vacancies on the surfaces of Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$ significantly enhances their catalytic activity for both hydrogen reduction and water oxidation reactions, further supporting their potential as photocatalysts for overall water splitting. Our study provides theoretical insights for the rational design of efficient and stable 2D photocatalysts for overall water splitting.

Title: Fluctuation-induced Hall-like lateral forces in a chiral-gain environment
Authors: Daigo Oue, Mário G. Silveirinha
Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag linked to the nonlinear Hall current. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.

Title: Spin Faraday pattern formation in a circular spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate with stripe phase
Authors: Shixiang Chen, Hongguang Liang, Juan Wang, Yan Li
Abstract: We investigate the spin Faraday pattern formation in a periodically driven, pancake-shaped spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) prepared with stripe phase. By modulating atomic interactions using in-phase and out-of-phase protocols, we observe collective excitation modes with distinct rotational symmetries (L-fold). Crucially, at the critical modulation frequency, out-of-phase modulation destabilizes the L = 6 pattern, whereas in-phase modulation not only preserves high symmetry but also excites higher-order modes. Unlike conventional binary BECs, Faraday patterns emerge here without initial noise due to SOC-induced symmetry breaking, with all patterns exhibiting supersolid characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate control over pattern symmetry, radial nodes, and pattern radius by tuning the modulation frequency, providing a new approach for manipulating quantum fluid dynamics. This work establishes a platform for exploring supersolidity and nonlinear excitations in SOC systems with stripe phase.

Title: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological trion insulator
Authors: Yichen Chu, Qizhong Zhu
Abstract: Trions, charged quasiparticles formed by binding an exciton to an excess charge carrier, dominate the optical response of doped transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and the study of the transport properties of trions in TMDs may have application in developing high-speed excitonic and optoelectronic devices. However, an important building block for low-dissipation optoelectronic devices that provides dissipationless transport channels for trions has remained elusive. Here, we propose the concept of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological trion insulator that features helical dissipationless edge states for trions. This is realized for intralayer trions, which inherit the valley-orbit coupling of intralayer excitons in TMDs subject to a moiré periodic potential. We find that under certain circumstances, the moiré trion band becomes topological, characterized by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological number. We further provide two specific material realizations of this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator: a doped monolayer TMD placed on top of a twisted hBN substrate, and a generic twisted TMD heterobilayer. We also examine the effect of charge screening and find that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological trion insulator remains robust. Our work paves the way toward realizing dissipationless excitonic devices.

Title: Two-Stage Ordering and Elastocaloric Effect in TmVO$_4$
Authors: Sayan Ghosh, Anirudha Menon, Manoranjan Kumar, Rajiv R.P. Singh
Abstract: Rare-earth material TmVO$_4$ shows ferro-quadrupolar order below a critical temperature which can be tuned by various parameters such as a magnetic field, a strain field, chemical composition, and nuclear spin coupling to its non-Kramers electronic doublets. In this work, we study a pseudo-spin-1/2 model to understand the various phases in TmVO$_4$. The model captures coupled electronic and nuclear orders via (i) a ferro-quadrupolar Jahn-Teller interaction, (ii) a $B_{1g}$ shear strain, (iii) a transverse magnetic field, and (iv) a weak on-site nuclear hyperfine coupling A. At zero transverse magnetic and strain fields, electronic quadrupoles undergo a second-order transition at $T_Q$, lowering the entropy per site from ln 4 to ln 2. At a much lower $T_N$ ~ $A^2/T_Q$, virtual electronic fluctuations mediate an effective nuclear-spin Ising interaction, driving a second transition that collapses the remaining entropy. Under a transverse magnetic field, nuclear moments polarize smoothly, replacing the sharp low-T transition by a crossover. In contrast, adiabatic $B_{1g}$ strain sweeps across the two ordering temperatures yielding a pronounced two-step elastocaloric effect, highlighting TmVO$_4$ as a tunable strain-driven solid-state refrigerant.

Title: Fingerprints of collective magnetic excitations in inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy
Authors: Finnian Rist, Henry L. Nourse, Ben J. Powell
Abstract: Spin-flip inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy allows magnetic materials to be probed at the single-atom level via scanning tunneling microscopy. Previously, the local spectral weight of spin excitations of small systems has been deduced from discrete steps in the differential conductance. However, this is not viable for large systems. We show that the local spin density of states can be measured via the double differential conductance. This contrasts with elastic measurements where the local density of electronic states is deduced from the differential conductance. We study the tunneling currents of the spin-1/2 and -1 Heisenberg chains and propose a method to probe zero-frequency modes.

Title: Hydrodynamic Theory of Two-dimensional Chiral Malthusian Flocks
Authors: Leiming Chen, Chiu Fan Lee, John Toner
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic behavior of two-dimensional chiral dry Malthusian flocks; that is, chiral polar-ordered active matter with neither number nor momentum conservation. We show that, in the absence of fluctuations, such systems generically form a ``time cholesteric", in which the velocity of the entire system rotates uniformly at a fixed frequency b. Fluctuations about this state belong to the universality class of (2+1)-Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, which implies short-ranged orientational order in the hydrodynamic limit. We then show that, in the limit of weak chirality, the hydrodynamics of a system with reasonable size is expected to governed by the linear regime of the KPZ equation, exhibiting quasi-long-ranged orientational order. Our predictions for the velocity and number density correlations are testable in both simulations and experiments.

Title: A Riemann-Hilbert Approach to Slavnov Overlaps in the Lieb-Liniger model
Authors: Eldad Bettelheim
Abstract: We provide a method to compute Slavnov overlaps in the Lieb-Liniger model using the steepest descent method of the Riemann-Hilbert problem. To do so, we employ the Matsuo-Kostov Representation of the Slavnov overlaps to write an integral equation for the respective resolvent, and then represent this equation as a Riemann-Hilbert problem. We demonstrate the validity and applicability of the method by computing the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in the $c\to\infty$ limit, corresponding to free fermions.

Title: Time-energy tradeoff in stochastic resetting using optimal control
Authors: Rémi Goerlich, Kristian Stølevik Olsen, Hartmut Löwen, Yael Roichman
Abstract: Stochastic resetting is a driving mechanism that is known to minimize the first passage time to reach a target, at the cost of energy expenditure. The choice of the physical implementation of each resetting event determines the tradeoff between the acceleration of the search process and its energetic cost. Here, we present an optimal transport protocol that balances the duration and the energetic cost of each resetting event. This protocol drives a harmonically trapped Brownian particle between two equilibrium states within a finite time and with minimal energetic cost. An explicit comparison with other types of finite-time protocols further shows its specific thermodynamic properties. Its cost is both a lower bound on the cost of unoptimized shortcut protocols and an upper bound on the cost of optimal protocols which do not ensure final equilibrium. When applying the optimal transport protocol to implement stochastic resetting, a single lower time-energy bound is reached: this protocol allows to reach the best tradeoff between energetic cost and search time.

Title: The gauge theory dual of the bilayer XY model with second order Josephson coupling
Authors: Pye Ton How, Sungkit Yip
Abstract: We formulate a duality transformation for a bilayer XY model where the layers are coupled by second order Josephson effect, which favors inter-layer phase difference of either $0$ or $\pi$. The model may represent a bilayer superconductor or a spin-1 ferromagnetic Bose gas in the easy-plane limit. The second order Josephson term is mapped to a U(1) gauge field, known to be trivially confining in two dimensions, and we argue that a Coulomb-gas analysis is not applicable to the dual theory. Instead, we appeal to the vast knowledge of gauge theory and infer that the only phase transition out of low-temperature ordered phase is an Ising transition driven by condensation of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ domain wall loops. The domain wall loops can be seen as a surviving vestige of single-layer vortex-anti-vortex pair, heavily deformed by the second order Josephson coupling. A theoretical or computational method that concentrates on point defects would most likely miss out on these excitations and reach erroneous results. Our dual theory offers a clear, intuitive picture of how the second order Josephson coupling induces confinement of vortices and drastically changes the physics.

Title: Entanglement blossom in a simplex matryoshka
Authors: Zhao Zhang
Abstract: Exotic entanglement entropy scaling properties usually come with interesting entanglement structures in real space and novel metrics of the spacetime lattice. One prominent example is the rainbow chain where lattice sites symmetric about the center form entangled Bell pairs due to an effective long-range coupling from the strong inhomogeneity of the coupling strength. This manuscript generalizes the rainbow chain to higher dimensional space on lattices with Hausdorff dimension one and enlarged local Hilbert space keeping the Hamiltonian frustration free. The effective Hamiltonian from the Schrieffer-Wolf transformation is given by a stacking of layers of $k$-simplices with $0$-dimensional (fully-connected) antiferromagnetic Hamiltonians, which can be diagonalized analytically with Young operators. The original lattice can be obtained from proliferating disinclination defects in a regular $k$-dimensional cubical lattice, which introduces curvature at the center of the lattice. The model interpolates between the SYK model and the free-fermionic XX spin chain, and hence might be potentially useful in understanding black hole physics and holography.

Title: Virtual Quantum Markov Chains
Authors: Yu-Ao Chen, Chengkai Zhu, Keming He, Mingrui Jing, Xin Wang
Abstract: Quantum Markov chains generalize classical Markov chains for random variables to the quantum realm and exhibit unique inherent properties, making them an important feature in quantum information theory. In this work, we propose the concept of virtual quantum Markov chains (VQMCs), focusing on scenarios where subsystems retain classical information about global systems from measurement statistics. As a generalization of quantum Markov chains, VQMCs characterize states where arbitrary global shadow information can be recovered from subsystems through local quantum operations and measurements. We present an algebraic characterization for virtual quantum Markov chains and show that the virtual quantum recovery is fully determined by the block matrices of a quantum state on its subsystems. Notably, we find a distinction between two classes of tripartite entanglement by showing that the W state is a VQMC while the GHZ state is not. Furthermore, we introduce the virtual non-Markovianity to quantify the non-Markovianity of a given quantum state, which also assesses the optimal sampling overhead for virtually recovering this state. Our findings elucidate distinctions between quantum Markov chains and virtual quantum Markov chains, extending our understanding of quantum recovery to scenarios prioritizing classical information from measurement statistics.

Title: Dual-unitary shadow tomography
Authors: Ahmed A. Akhtar, Namit Anand, Jeffrey Marshall, Yi-Zhuang You
Abstract: We introduce ``dual-unitary shadow tomography'' (DUST), a classical shadow tomography protocol based on dual-unitary brick-wall circuits. To quantify the performance of DUST, we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$ and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. For the task of predicting operators with (nearly) full support, we show that DUST outperforms brick-wall Clifford shadows of equal depth. This advantage is further pronounced for small system sizes and our results are generally robust to finite-size effects.

Title: Non-stabilizerness in kinetically-constrained Rydberg atom arrays
Authors: Ryan Smith, Zlatko Papić, Andrew Hallam
Abstract: Non-stabilizer states are a fundamental resource for universal quantum computation. However,despite broad significance in quantum computing, the emergence of "many-body" non-stabilizerness in interacting quantum systems remains poorly understood due to its analytical intractability. Here we show that Rydberg atom arrays provide a natural reservoir of non-stabilizerness that extends beyond single qubits and arises from quantum correlations engendered by the Rydberg blockade. We demonstrate that this non-stabilizerness can be experimentally accessed in two complementary ways, either by performing quench dynamics or via adiabatic ground state preparation. Using the analytical framework based on matrix product states, we explain the origin of Rydberg nonstabilizerness via a quantum circuit decomposition of the wave function.

Authors: Yang Hou, Zhanpeng Fu, Roderich Moessner, Marin Bukov, Hongzheng Zhao
Abstract: We present a general framework to implement massive Nambu-Goldstone quasi-particles in driven many-body systems. The underlying mechanism leverages an explicit Lie group structure imprinted into an effective Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom; the resulting emergent continuous symmetry is weakly explicitly broken, giving rise to a massive Nambu-Goldstone mode, with a spectral mass gap scaling linearly with the drive period. We discuss explicit and experimentally implementable realizations, such as Heisenberg-like spin models that support gapped spin-wave excitations. We provide a protocol to certify the existence of the massive Nambu-Goldstone mode from the dynamics of specific observables, and analyse the dispersion spectrum and their lifetime in the presence of weak explicit symmetry breaking.

Title: Quantum thermalization of translation-invariant systems at high temperature
Authors: Saúl Pilatowsky-Cameo, Soonwon Choi
Abstract: Quantum thermalization describes how closed quantum systems can effectively reach thermal equilibrium, resolving the apparent incongruity between the reversibility of Schrödinger's equation and the second law of thermodynamics. Despite its ubiquity and conceptual significance, the precise conditions that give rise to quantum thermalization are still not well understood. After nearly a century of efforts, we have yet to find a complete mathematical proof that an effective statistical description naturally emerges the underlying quantum dynamics in generic settings. Here, we prove that quantum thermalization must occur in any qubit system with local interactions under three conditions: (i) high effective temperature, (ii) translation invariance, and (iii) no perfect resonances in the energy spectrum. Specifically, we show that a typical, low-complexity pure state drawn from any ensemble with large entropy and well-defined effective temperature becomes locally indistinguishable from a Gibbs state upon unitary evolution. In this setting, our rigorous results prove the widely anticipated notion that statistical physics should be understood as an emergent phenomenon, explicitly derived from the first principles of quantum mechanics.

Title: The random free field scalar theory
Authors: Alessandro Piazza, Marco Serone, Emilio Trevisani
Abstract: Quantum field theories with quenched disorder are so hard to study that even exactly solvable free theories present puzzling aspects. We consider a free scalar field $\phi$ in $d$ dimensions coupled to a random source $h$ with quenched disorder. Despite the presence of a mass scale governing the disorder distribution, we derive a new description of the theory that allows us to show that the theory is gapless and invariant under conformal symmetry, which acts in a non-trivial way on $\phi$ and $h$. This manifest CFT description reveals the presence of exotic continuous symmetries, such as nilpotent bosonic ones, in the quenched theory. We also reconsider Cardy's CFT description defined through the replica trick. In this description, the nilpotent symmetries reveal a striking resemblance with Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetries. We provide explicit maps of correlation functions between such CFTs and the original quenched theory. The maps are non-trivial and show that conformal behaviour is manifest only when considering suitable linear combinations of averages of products of correlators. We also briefly discuss how familiar notions like normal ordering of composite operators and OPE can be generalized in the presence of the more complicated local observables in the quenched theory.

Title: Lagrangian neural networks for nonholonomic mechanics
Authors: Viviana Alejandra Diaz, Leandro Martin Salomone, Marcela Zuccalli
Abstract: Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) are a powerful tool for addressing physical systems, particularly those governed by conservation laws. LNNs can parametrize the Lagrangian of a system to predict trajectories with nearly conserved energy. These techniques have proven effective in unconstrained systems as well as those with holonomic constraints. In this work, we adapt LNN techniques to mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints. We test our approach on some well-known examples with nonholonomic constraints, showing that incorporating these restrictions into the neural network's learning improves not only trajectory estimation accuracy but also ensures adherence to constraints and exhibits better energy behavior compared to the unconstrained counterpart.

Title: Bethe Ansatz, Quantum Circuits, and the F-basis
Authors: Roberto Ruiz, Alejandro Sopena, Esperanza López, Germán Sierra, Balázs Pozsgay
Abstract: The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superposition of plane waves that is characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.

Title: String breaking dynamics in Ising chain with local vibrations
Authors: Arindam Mallick, Maciej Lewenstein, Jakub Zakrzewski, Marcin Płodzień
Abstract: We consider the dynamics in the one-dimensional quantum Ising model in which each spin coherently interacts with its phononic mode. The model is motivated by quantum simulators based on Rydberg atoms in tweezers or trapped ions. The configuration of two domain walls simulates the particle-antiparticle connecting string. We concentrate on the effect the local vibrations have on the dynamics of this initial state. Our study supplements recent investigations of string breaking, traditionally studied within quantum chromodynamics (QCD), to quantum many-body systems. Two regimes are identified depending on the strength of the coupling with local vibrations. For weak coupling, the string breaking is slowed down as compared to the dynamics in an isolated Ising string. The strong coupling leads to complicated dynamics in which the domain wall character of excitation is dissolved among many coupled states.

Title: Fault-tolerant quantum simulation of generalized Hubbard models
Authors: Andreas Juul Bay-Smidt, Frederik Ravn Klausen, Christoph Sünderhauf, Róbert Izsák, Gemma C. Solomon, Nick S. Blunt
Abstract: Quantum simulations of strongly interacting fermionic systems, such as those described by the Hubbard model, are promising candidates for useful early fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which uses a set of tiles to construct Trotter decompositions of arbitrary lattice Hubbard models. The Tile Trotterization scheme also enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model. We improve previous Hubbard model commutator bounds, further provide tight commutator bounds for periodic extended Hubbard models, and demonstrate the use of tensor network methods for this task. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate hexagonal lattice Hubbard models and compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, demonstrating that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.

Title: A Denser Hydrogen Inferred from First-Principles Simulations Challenges Jupiter's Interior Models
Authors: Cesare Cozza, Kousuke Nakano, Saburo Howard, Hao Xie, Ravit Helled, Guglielmo Mazzola
Abstract: First-principle modeling of dense hydrogen is crucial in materials and planetary sciences. Despite its apparent simplicity, predicting the ionic and electronic structure of hydrogen is a formidable challenge, and it is connected with the insulator-to-metal transition, a century-old problem in condensed matter. Accurate simulations of liquid hydrogen are also essential for modeling gas giant planets. Here we perform an exhaustive study of the equation of state of hydrogen using Density Functional Theory and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the pressure predicted by Density Functional Theory may vary qualitatively when using different functionals. The predictive power of first-principle simulations is restored by validating each functional against higher-level wavefunction theories, represented by computationally intensive variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. Our simulations provide evidence that hydrogen is denser at planetary conditions, compared to currently used equations of state. For Jupiter, this implies a lower bulk metallicity (i.e., a smaller mass of heavy elements). Our results further amplify the inconsistency between Jupiter's atmospheric metallicity measured by the Galileo probe and the envelope metallicity inferred from interior models.

Title: Growing Neural Networks: Dynamic Evolution through Gradient Descent
Authors: Anil Radhakrishnan, John F. Lindner, Scott T. Miller, Sudeshna Sinha, William L. Ditto
Abstract: In contrast to conventional artificial neural networks, which are structurally static, we present two approaches for evolving small networks into larger ones during training. The first method employs an auxiliary weight that directly controls network size, while the second uses a controller-generated mask to modulate neuron participation. Both approaches optimize network size through the same gradient-descent algorithm that updates the network's weights and biases. We evaluate these growing networks on nonlinear regression and classification tasks, where they consistently outperform static networks of equivalent final size. We then explore the hyperparameter space of these networks to find associated scaling relations relative to their static counterparts. Our results suggest that starting small and growing naturally may be preferable to simply starting large, particularly as neural networks continue to grow in size and energy consumption.

Title: Fermionic CFTs from topological boundaries in abelian Chern-Simons theories
Authors: Kohki Kawabata, Tatsuma Nishioka, Takuya Okuda, Shinichiro Yahagi
Abstract: A quantum field theory is referred to as bosonic (non-spin) if its physical quantities are independent of the spacetime spin structure, and as fermionic (spin) if they depend on it. We explore fermionic conformal field theories (CFTs) that emerge from bosonic abelian Chern-Simons theories, playing the role of a symmetry topological field theory, by imposing topological boundary conditions. Our construction includes the fermionic generalization of code CFTs. When the Chern-Simons theory is associated with the root lattice of a simply laced Lie algebra, this approach yields a fermionic CFT with a level-one affine Lie algebra symmetry. As an application, we consider the Chern-Simons theories corresponding to a class of supersymmetric vertex operator algebras studied by Johnson-Freyd and classify their fermionic topological boundary conditions that give rise to supersymmetric CFTs.

Title: A Tutorial on Knots and Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Dmitry Melnikov
Abstract: These notes review a description of quantum mechanics in terms of the topology of spaces, basing on the axioms of Topological Quantum Field Theory and path integral formalism. In this description quantum states and operators are encoded by the topology of spaces that are used as modules to build the quantum mechanical model, while expectation values and probabilities are given by topological invariants of spaces, knots and links. The notes focus on the specific way the topology encodes quantum mechanical features, or, equivalently, on how these features can be controlled through the topology. A topological classification of entanglement is discussed, as well as properties of entanglement entropy and basic quantum protocols. The primary aim is to build a less conventional diagrammatic intuition about quantum mechanics, expanding the paradigm of ``Quantum Picturalism".

Title: Pushing the Boundary of Quantum Advantage in Hard Combinatorial Optimization with Probabilistic Computers

Abstract: Recent demonstrations on specialized benchmarks have reignited excitement for quantum computers, yet whether they can deliver an advantage for practical real-world problems remains an open question. Here, we show that probabilistic computers (p-computers), when co-designed with hardware to implement powerful Monte Carlo algorithms, provide a compelling and scalable classical pathway for solving hard optimization problems. We focus on two key algorithms applied to 3D spin glasses: discrete-time simulated quantum annealing (DT-SQA) and adaptive parallel tempering (APT). We benchmark these methods against the performance of a leading quantum annealer on the same problem instances. For DT-SQA, we find that increasing the number of replicas improves residual energy scaling, in line with expectations from extreme value theory. We then show that APT, when supported by non-local isoenergetic cluster moves, exhibits a more favorable scaling and ultimately outperforms DT-SQA. We demonstrate these algorithms are readily implementable in modern hardware, projecting that custom Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or specialized chips can leverage massive parallelism to accelerate these algorithms by orders of magnitude while drastically improving energy efficiency. Our results establish a new, rigorous classical baseline, clarifying the landscape for assessing a practical quantum advantage and presenting p-computers as a scalable platform for real-world optimization challenges.

Title: Architecture-Aware Minimization (A$^2$M): How to Find Flat Minima in Neural Architecture Search
Authors: Matteo Gambella, Fabrizio Pittorino, Manuel Roveri
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has become an essential tool for designing effective and efficient neural networks. In this paper, we investigate the geometric properties of neural architecture spaces commonly used in differentiable NAS methods, specifically NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS. By defining flatness metrics such as neighborhoods and loss barriers along paths in architecture space, we reveal locality and flatness characteristics analogous to the well-known properties of neural network loss landscapes in weight space. In particular, we find that highly accurate architectures cluster together in flat regions, while suboptimal architectures remain isolated, unveiling the detailed geometrical structure of the architecture search landscape. Building on these insights, we propose Architecture-Aware Minimization (A$^2$M), a novel analytically derived algorithmic framework that explicitly biases, for the first time, the gradient of differentiable NAS methods towards flat minima in architecture space. A$^2$M consistently improves generalization over state-of-the-art DARTS-based algorithms on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet16-120, across both NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces. Notably, A$^2$M is able to increase the test accuracy, on average across different differentiable NAS methods, by +3.60\% on CIFAR-10, +4.60\% on CIFAR-100, and +3.64\% on ImageNet16-120, demonstrating its superior effectiveness in practice. A$^2$M can be easily integrated into existing differentiable NAS frameworks, offering a versatile tool for future research and applications in automated machine learning. We open-source our code at this https URL.

Title: On the non-integrability of driven-dissipative one-dimensional hard-core bosons
Authors: Martina Zündel
Abstract: We address the question whether hard-core bosons, equivalent to the XX-model, remain integrable once the system is no longer closed. We consider the lattice version under incoherent local pump and loss and show, using random matrix theory, that the statistics of the complex spacial ratios indicate that the system is chaotic. Further, we show that the model belongs in the AI$^{\dagger}$ universality class of random matrices. In addition to this analysis, we investigate an emergent stripe pattern in the Lindbladian spectrum and relate it to the dissipative parameters of the model.

Title: Non-linear and non-empirical double hybrid density functional
Authors: Danish Khan
Abstract: We develop a non-linear and non-empirical (nlane) double hybrid density functional derived from an accurate interpolation of the adiabatic connection in density functional theory, incorporating the correct asymptotic expansions. By bridging the second-order perturbative weak correlation limit with the fully interacting limit from the semi-local SCAN functional, nlane-SCAN is free of fitted parameters while providing improved energetic predictions compared to SCAN for moderately and strongly correlated systems alike. It delivers accurate predictions for atomic total energies and multiple reaction datasets from the GMTKN55 benchmark while significantly outperforming traditional linear hybrids and double hybrids for non-covalent interactions without requiring dispersion corrections. Due to the exact constraints at the weak correlation limit, nlane-SCAN has reduced delocalization errors as evident through the SIE4x4 benchmark and bond dissociations of H\(_2^+\) and He\(_2^+\). Its proper asymptotic behavior ensures stability in strongly correlated systems, improving H\(_2\) and N\(_2\) bond dissociation profiles compared to conventional functionals.

Title: Strain Effects in a Directly Bonded Diamond-on-Insulator Substrate
Authors: Ioannis Varveris, Gianni D. Aliberti, Tianyin Chen, Filip A. Sfetcu, Diederik J. W. Dekker, Alfred Schuurmans, Nikolaj K. Nitzsche, Salahuddin Nur, Ryoichi Ishihara
Abstract: The direct bonding process of a diamond-on-insulator (DOI) substrate enables monolithic integration of diamond photonic structures for quantum computing by improving photon collection efficiency and entanglement generation rate between emitters. It also addresses key fabrication challenges, such as robustness, bonding strength, and scalability. This study investigates strain effects in DOI substrates following direct bonding. Strain generation is expected near the diamond-SiO$_2$/Si interface due to thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the bonded materials. Strain-induced lattice distortions are characterized using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and photoluminescence (PL) mapping. PL mapping reveals interference fringes in unbonded regions, indicating bonding irregularities. Depth-resolved ODMR measurements show a volumetric strain component increase of $\approx$0.45 MHz and a shear component increase of $\approx$0.71 MHz between the top surface and the DOI interface. However, ODMR signal contrast and peak linewidth remain largely unaffected, suggesting no visible deterioration in the optical properties of the emitters. By combining ODMR and PL mapping, this work establishes a robust methodology for assessing bonding quality and strain impact on NV centers, an essential step toward advancing scalable quantum technologies and integrated photonic circuits.

Title: Restoring the second law to classical-quantum dynamics
Authors: Isaac Layton, Harry J. D. Miller
Abstract: All physical theories should obey the second law of thermodynamics. However, existing proposals to describe the dynamics of hybrid classical-quantum systems either violate the second law or lack a proof of its existence. Here we rectify this by studying classical-quantum dynamics that are (1) linear and completely-positive and (2) preserve the thermal state of the classical-quantum system. We first prove that such dynamics necessarily satisfy the second law. We then show how these dynamics may be constructed, proposing dynamics that generalise the standard Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations for classical systems in thermal environments to include back-reaction from a quantum degree of freedom. Deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for completely-positive, linear and continuous classical-quantum dynamics to satisfy detailed balance, we find this property satisfied by our dynamics. To illustrate the formalism and its applications we introduce two models. The first is an analytically solvable model of an overdamped classical system coupled to a quantum two-level system, which we use to study the total entropy production in both quantum system and classical measurement apparatus during a quantum measurement. The second describes an underdamped classical-quantum oscillator system subject to friction, which we numerically demonstrate exhibits thermalisation in the adiabatic basis, showing the relevance of our dynamics for the mixed classical-quantum simulation of molecules.

Title: Coupled Instantons In A Four-Well Potential With Application To The Tunneling Of A Composite Particle
Authors: Pervez Hoodbhoy, M. Haashir Ismail, M. Mufassir
Abstract: Coupled instantons are introduced by generalizing the double well potential to multiple mutually coupled wells. Physically this corresponds to the simultaneous tunneling of multiple degrees of freedom. A system with four equal minima is examined in detail. It has three instanton types or flavors with distinct actions. For weak coupling and subject to there being a single large (or small) parameter, the interactive system can be handled perturbatively. The zero mode problem arising from time translation symmetry is handled via the Fadeev-Popov procedure. A diagrammatic procedure allows corrections to the fluctuation determinant to be calculated systematically. Independent instanton contributions are summed over by extending the dilute gas approximation to three flavors and energy splittings of the lowest four states is calculated. All tunneling amplitudes are concisely expressed in terms of elementary functions. While the model is possibly useful for a variety of physical systems, an application is made here to the tunneling of a composite particle in one dimension.

Title: Probing plexciton dynamics with higher-order spectroscopy
Authors: Simon Büttner, Luca Nils Philipp, Julian Lüttig, Maximilian Rödel, Matthias Hensen, Jens Pflaum, Roland Mitric, Tobias Brixner
Abstract: Coupling molecular transition dipole moments to surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) results in the formation of new optical quasiparticles, i.e., plexcitons. Mixing the specific properties of matter excitations and light modes has proven to be an efficient strategy to alter a variety of molecular processes ranging from chemical reactions to exciton transport. Here, we investigate energy transfer in a plexcitonic system of zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecules aggregated in the crystalline {\alpha}-phase and an SPP on a planar gold surface. By tuning the angle of incidence, we vary the degree of mixing between excitonic and SPP character of the excited state. We apply our recently developed higher-order pump-probe spectroscopy to separate the system's fifth-order signal describing the dynamics of two-particle interactions. The time it takes for two quasiparticles to meet and annihilate is a measure of their movement and thus the transport of excitation energy in the system. We find that the transport extracted from the fifth-order signal is surprisingly unaffected by the mixing ratio of exciton and SPP contributions of the plexciton. Using a rate equation model, we explain this behavior by fast transition from the plexcitonic states to many localized excitonic dark states that do not have an SPP contribution. Our results give an indication of how hybrid exciton-plasmon systems should be designed to exploit the delocalization of the involved plasmon modes for improved transport.

Title: Experimental study of the distributions of off-diagonal scattering-matrix elements of quantum graphs with symplectic symmetry
Authors: Jiongning Che, Nils Gluth, Simon Köhnes, Thomas Guhr, Barbara Dietz
Abstract: We report on experimental studies of the distribution of the off-diagonal elements of the scattering matrix of open microwave networks with symplectic symmetry and a chaotic wave dynamics. These consist of two geometrically identical subgraphs with unitary symmetry described by complex conjugate Hamiltonians, that are coupled by a pair of bonds. The results are compared to random-matrix theory predictions obtained on the basis of the Heidelberg approach for the scattering matrix of open quantum-chaotic systems. We demonstrate that deviations from random-matrix theory predictions observed in the distributions may be attributed to the fact that the subgraphs are not fully connected.

Title: Nanoscale Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Control of a Strongly Interacting Dipolar System
Authors: Piotr Put, Nathaniel T. Leitao, Christina Spaegele, Haoyang Gao, Oksana Makarova, Bartholomeus Machielse, Hengyun Zhou, Federico Capasso, Leigh S. Martin, Hongkun Park, Mikhail D. Lukin
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a foundational tool in the physical and life sciences, yet conventional implementations are typically limited to macroscopic spatial resolution. Here, we introduce a method for nanoscale MRI by combining strong, time-dependent magnetic field gradients with global coherent control over a dense ensemble of electron spins in diamond. This approach enables spatially structured manipulation of spin dynamics, allowing us to generate and track nanoscale spin textures - patterns of spin polarization - that evolve under engineered many-body dipolar interactions. By tuning the rotational symmetry of the dipolar exchange interactions, we observe pronounced sensitivity of the spin dynamics to the microscopic structure of the polarization, which we resolve through nanoscale MRI. Our results open the door for robust control of metrologically useful entanglement and nanoscale imaging of materials and biological systems under ambient conditions.

Title: Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus
Authors: Aswathy K R, Udaya Maurya, Surya Teja Gavva, Rickmoy Samanta
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.

Title: Mixed-state phases from local reversibility
Authors: Shengqi Sang, Leonardo A. Lessa, Roger S. K. Mong, Tarun Grover, Chong Wang, Timothy H. Hsieh
Abstract: We propose a refined definition of mixed-state phase equivalence based on locally reversible channel circuits. We show that such circuits preserve topological degeneracy and the locality of all operators including both strong and weak symmetries. Under a locally reversible channel, weak unitary symmetries are locally dressed into channel symmetries, a new generalization of symmetry for open quantum systems. For abelian higher-form symmetries, we show the refined definition preserves anomalies and spontaneous breaking of such symmetries within a phase. As a primary example, a two-dimensional classical loop ensemble is trivial under the previously adopted definition of mixed-state phases. However, it has non-trivial topological degeneracy arising from a mutual anomaly between strong and weak 1-form symmetries, and our results show that it is not connected to a trivial state via locally reversible channel circuits.

Title: Interfacial Entanglement-Induced Time-Dependent Solidification of Polymeric Fluids
Authors: Jaewon Shim (Seoul National University), Manhee Lee (Chungbuk National University), Wonho Jhe (Seoul National University)
Abstract: The structure of polymers at solid interfaces evolves over time, but the corresponding changes in their rheological properties remain poorly understood. Here, using a home-built quartz tuning fork atomic force microscope-based nano-rheometer, we directly measure the time-dependent viscoelasticity of the interfacial fluid. The bottommost layer, closest to the substrate, undergoes solidification over 10 hours, exhibiting an approximately five-fold increase in storage modulus and a two-fold increase in loss modulus. This arises from interfacial entanglement due to the strong binding of polymers to the solid surface driven by solid-wall attractive interactions. In contrast, within the second and third layers, the storage modulus remains nearly constant over time, while the loss modulus shows approximately two-fold increase. In this region, unlike the strongly bound first layer, entropic repulsion dominates, allowing the material to behave fluid-like while becoming increasingly viscous. Notably, as the first layer, where interfacial entanglement occurs, undergoes solidification, the flow boundary for interfacial fluid flow shifts upward away from the substrate, resulting in a negative slip length. This highlights the critical role of nanoscale interfacial structure and properties in governing macroscopic flow behavior.

Title: Local nanoscale probing of electron spins using NV centers in diamond
Authors: Sergei Trofimov, Christos Thessalonikios, Victor Deinhart, Alexander Spyrantis, Lucas Tsunaki, Kseniia Volkova, Katja Höflich, Boris Naydenov
Abstract: Substitutional nitrogen atoms in a diamond crystal (P1 centers) are, on one hand, a resource for creation of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, that have been widely employed as nanoscale quantum sensors. On the other hand, P1's electron spin is a source of paramagnetic noise that degrades the NV's performance by shortening its coherence time. Accurate quantification of nitrogen concentration is therefore essential for optimizing diamond-based quantum devices. However, bulk characterization methods based on optical absorption or electron paramagnetic resonance often overlook local variations in nitrogen content. In this work, we use a helium ion microscope to fabricate nanoscale NV center ensembles at predefined sites in a diamond crystal containing low concentrations of nitrogen. We then utilize these NV-based probes to measure the local nitrogen concentration on the level of 230 ppb (atomic parts per billion) using the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique. Moreover, by comparing the DEER spectra with numerical simulations, we managed to determine the concentration of other unknown paramagnetic defects created during the ion implantation, reaching 15 ppb depending on the implantation dose.

Title: SETOL: A Semi-Empirical Theory of (Deep) Learning
Authors: Charles H Martin, Christopher Hinrichs
Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry. The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning, including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models, we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.
