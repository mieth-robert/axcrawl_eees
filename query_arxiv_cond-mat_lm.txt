Title: Hydrogen trapping in sub-stoichiometric niobium and vanadium carbide precipitates in high-strength steels
Authors: Xiaohan Bie, Jun Song
Abstract: High strength steels (HSS) are widely used in aerospace industries but they can be susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement (HE), a phenomenon that with the ingress of a small amount of hydrogen, the materials can experience a ductile to brittle transition. Secondary carbide precipitates play a crucial role in reducing HE in steels by providing strong hydrogen traps, reducing diffusible hydrogen atoms that are detrimental to the steel ductility. Among the secondary carbide precipitates, sub-stoichiometric vanadium and niobium carbides contain high concentrations of carbon vacancies, which serve as robust hydrogen traps that greatly reduced diffusible hydrogen atoms, beneficial for the HE resistivity. This study investigated hydrogen trapping energies in VCx and NbCx and revealed that sub-stoichiometry plays a role in hydrogen trapping ability. Further examination of hydrogen trapping in vacancies revealed the charge density at vacancy can affect the bonding between hydrogen and neighboring V/Nb atoms. Additionally, the vacancy configurations in VCx and NbCx with varying x plays a role in hydrogen diffusional barriers inside them. Carbides with more vacancies possess reduced hydrogen diffusional barriers within them. In conclusion, the vacancies in certain carbide compounds can enhance both the trapping energy and possibly trapping capacity of hydrogen atoms, ultimately reducing the susceptibility of HSS to HE.

Title: Ordering the topological order in the fractional quantum Hall effect
Authors: Meng Cheng, Seth Musser, Amir Raz, Nathan Seiberg, T. Senthil
Abstract: We discuss the possible topological order/topological quantum field theory of different quantum Hall systems. Given the value of the Hall conductivity, we constrain the global symmetry of the low-energy theory and its anomaly. Specifically, the one-form global symmetry and its anomaly are presented as the organizing principle of these systems. This information is powerful enough to lead to a unique minimal topological order (or a small number of minimal topological orders). Almost all of the known experimentally discovered topological orders are these minimal theories. Since this work is interdisciplinary, we made a special effort to relate to people with different backgrounds by providing translations between different perspectives.

Title: Monopoles, Dirac strings and Magnetic Noise in Model Spin Ice
Authors: A. Huster Zapke, P. C. W. Holdsworth
Abstract: Using the Dirac string formalism for monopoles we expose an extensive analogy between magnetic monopole excitations in the dumbbell model of spin ice and those of the vacuum. In both cases the Dirac strings are defined in the space-time of monopole trajectories which are simulated in spin ice using transition graphs between initial and final configurations. The Stanford experiment for Dirac monopole detection is reconstructed in spin ice using the fragmentation procedure. The setup is then extended to simulate magnetic noise experiments using stochastic dynamics. It is shown that the noise from the monopoles and their constraining strings can be separated and that the correlated signal over long times comes largely from the constraining strings rather than from the monopoles themselves.

Title: Crystal structure, magnetic properties and magnetocaloric performance of RE$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$ (RE = Gd-Tm) compounds
Authors: Altifani Rizky Hayyu, Stanisław Baran, Aleksandra Deptuch, Andrzej Szytuła
Abstract: Polycrystalline samples of the RE$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$ (RE = Gd--Tm) intermetallics have been investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as by DC and AC magnetometric measurements. The XRD data confirm that the compounds crystallize with the orthorhombic Lu$_{5}$Ni$_2$In$_4$-type structure (space group Pbam, No. 55). With decreasing temperature, RE$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$ spontaneously order magnetically with the critical temperatures of magnetic order equal to 10.6, 14.2, 15.4, 7.2, 5.9 and 4.9 K for RE = Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er and Tm, respectively. The compounds have complex magnetic properties, showing features characteristic of both ferro- and antiferromagnetic orderings. Moreover, the magnetic properties change with increasing number of the 4f electrons from predominantly ferromagnetic in Gd$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$ to predominantly antiferromagnetic in Tm$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$. The magnetic data indicate that only the rare earth atoms carry magnetic moments. The maximum magnetic entropy change ($-\Delta S_{M}^{max}$) at the 0-9 T magnetic flux density change ($\Delta \mu_0 H$) equals 12.4 J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ at 17 K for Gd$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$, 11.3 J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ at 28 K for Tb$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$, 13.1 J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ at 19 K for Dy$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$, 16.4 J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ at 12 K for Ho$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$, 15.3 J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ at 8 K for Er$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$ and 12.6 J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ at 6.5 K for Tm$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$. For a selected rare earth element (RE), the member of the RE$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$ family of compounds reaches the highest $-\Delta S_{M}^{max}$ value, when compared with its RE$_{5}$T$_2$In$_4$ (T = Ni, Pd, Pt) isostructural analogues, making the RE$_{5}$Rh$_2$In$_4$ intermetallics a good choice for application in low-temperature magnetic refrigeration.

Title: Flux Jumps up to 17 T in ReBCO Tape Stack Cables and their Suppression with Increased Intertape Spacing
Authors: Tushar Garg (1), Mike D. Sumption (1), Milan Majoros (1), Edward Collings (1), Jan Jaroszynski (2), Eun-Sang Choi (2) ((1) Center for Superconducting and Magnetic Materials, Materials Science Department, Ohio State University, (2) National High Magnetic Field Laboratory)
Abstract: The magnetization of ReBCO tape stacks and tape stack cables in high magnetic fields (up to 30 T) are not commonly reported. Here we report magnetization measurements of tape stack cables in magnetic fields up to 30 T at 4.2 K. We observed that flux jumps, commonly relegated to low field regimes for single tapes, persisted up to 17 T in tape stacks, an effect which could have substantial technological relevance for high field applications including fusion devices or accelerator magnets. On the other hand, with the use of small spacers, we could suppress flux jump behavior, in some cases eliminating jumps entirely. Our findings provide critical insights for the optimization of designs for ReBCO cables for high-field applications, including fusion magnets and particle accelerators.

Title: Structural and Bonding Insights into B8Cu3- Clusters: A DFT Study
Authors: P. L. Rodríguez-Kessler
Abstract: In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the structural and electronic properties of B8Cu3- clusters-boron-based frameworks doped with three copper atoms. The results indicate that the lowest-energy structure features a vertical Cu3 triangle supported on a B$_8$ wheel geometry, whereas the horizontally supported configuration is 3.0 (5.6) kcal/mol higher in energy at the PBE0 (wB97X) functional. Electron localization function (ELF) and Mulliken population analyses reveal that the most stable isomer exhibits strong Cu-B interactions and significant electron delocalization, which contribute to its enhanced stability. Localized orbital locator (LOL) maps further support this finding by showing pronounced electron localization around the Cu3 unit in the more stable structure. These insights highlight the possible role of Cu-centered multicenter bonding in stabilizing boron-based nanoclusters.

Title: Perpendicularly magnetized Tb/Co multilayers featuring tilted uniaxial anisotropy: Experiments and modeling
Authors: J. C. Rodriguez E., L. Avilés-Félix, M. H. Aguirre, L. M. Rodriguez, D. Salomoni, S. Auffret, R. C. Sousa, I. L. Prejbeanu, A. E. Bruchhausen, E. De Biasi, J. Curiale
Abstract: Rare earth/transition metal (RE/TM) multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are key ingredients for the development of spintronic applications. Their compensation temperature depends on the ratio of the thicknesses of rare earth and transition metal, allowing their magnetic properties to be tuned with temperature while maintaining their anisotropy even in nanometer-scale devices. In this work, we performed a thorough structural characterization and systematically investigate the magnetic properties of a whole family of ferrimagnetic [Tb/Co]$_{\times 5}$ multilayers varying the Tb thickness in the range of 0.4 nm - 1.25 nm. A linear dependence of the compensation temperature on the Tb layer thickness was observed. Moreover, a uniaxial anisotropy constant of 330$\pm$30 kJ/m$^3$, which is close to the values reported by other authors, was estimated. Additionally, we proposed a model to gain a better understanding of the angular dependence of the magnetization loops and the linear dependence of the compensation temperature. We present strong evidence demonstrating that the perpendicular anisotropy must be tilted away from the perpendicular axis in order to explain the observed features, particularly the hysteresis in the in-plane loops. Our work advances the understanding of DC magnetic properties in thin RE/TM ferrimagnetic films, which has the potential to impact different fields where these materials are involved.

Title: Coarse grained descriptions of the dynamics of yielding of amorphous solids under cyclic shear
Authors: Debargha Sarkar, Jishnu N. Nampoothiri, Muhittin Mungan, Jack T. Parley, Peter Sollich, Srikanth Sastry
Abstract: Recent computer simulations reveal several intriguing features in the evolution of properties of amorphous solids subjected to repeated cyclic shear deformation. These include the divergence of the number of cycles to reach steady states as the yielding point is approached, a non-monotonic change of properties with cycles, and the possibility of a spectrum of frozen states. Theoretical attempts to capture these properties through simple models, including the Ehrenfest model describing a random walk in a confining potential, have met partial success. Here, we show that incorporating the influence of mechanical noise through a feedback term leads to a genuine dynamical transition with characteristics reflecting those of yielding. Coarse graining the dynamics into a small number of variables leads to new insights regarding the dynamics of yielding.

Title: Statistical field theory of equilibrium amorphous solids and the intrinsic heterogeneity distributions that characterize them
Authors: Paul M. Goldbart (Stony Brook University)
Abstract: A rich variety of amorphous solids are found in nature and technology, including ones formed via the vulcanization of long, flexible molecules. A special class -- those featuring a wide gap between the long timescales over which constraints in them release and the much shorter timescales over which their unconstrained freedoms relax -- exhibit states of thermodynamic equilibrium and are thus amenable to the framework of equilibrium statistical physics. The approach reviewed here is the least specific -- and thus the most general -- approach to the statistical mechanics of equilibrium amorphous solid-formers: statistical field theory. An overview is given of the key elements and results of this theory. The field of the theory is constructed to detect and diagnose the amorphous solid state. Its form turns out to be unusual, in ways that are essential for its application, so it is examined in detail, as is the form of the field theory controlling the field. What this theory can predict for the equilibrium properties of amorphous solids is then discussed, including: the transition to the amorphous solid state and the heterogeneity of the resulting solid; the impact of fluctuations on the transition and connections with percolation theory; the pattern of symmetry-breaking and the nature of the resulting elasticity; and field correlations and the information they provide. Emphasis is placed on the idea, peculiar to amorphous solids, that their equilibrium states are naturally characterized in terms of distributions that capture the intrinsic spatial heterogeneity of the thermal motions of their constituents. The theory's field has an internal structure that subtly encodes this information, via the wave-vector dependencies of the average field and its correlations. Reflections are made on the applicability of theses ideas and results to a range of amorphous solids and related systems.

Title: Superconducting vacancy-ordered rock-salt NbO films
Authors: Jeong Rae Kim, Sandra Glotzer, Evan Krysko, Matthew R. Barone, Jinkwon Kim, Salva Salmani-Rezaie, Adrian Llanos, Joseph Falson
Abstract: We report molecular beam epitaxy synthesis of vacancy-ordered rocksalt NbO thin films which display superconductivity. A comparative study of substrates identifies Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001) as the optimal platform for realizing high-quality, single-phase films when growing at temperatures exceeding 1000 $^\circ$C. The controlled NbO films exhibit superconductivity with critical temperatures up to $T_\mathrm{c}$ = 1.37 K, comparable to bulk single crystals. This work addresses the fundamental bottlenecks encountered in the high-temperature epitaxy of compounds with uncommon oxidation states, while expanding the scope of available thin-film superconductors.

Title: Observation of Topological Hall Effect in Synthetic Antiferromagnetic Skyrmion System
Authors: Xinbao Geng, Guanqi Li, Zhongxiang Zhang, Wenjing Hu, Wenjing Zhong, Xiaoming Xiong, Yongbing Xu, Zhendong Chen, Junlin Wang, Xiangyu Zheng, Jing Wu
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) skyrmions have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation high-speed and highly integrated spintronic devices, owing to their exceptional properties such as high driving velocity, nanoscale dimensions, and the absence of the skyrmion Hall effect. In this work, we report the observation of the topological Hall effect in both compensated and non-compensated synthetic antiferromagnetic skyrmion systems based on [Pt/Co/Ru]2 bilayers. The antiferromagnetic skyrmions are demonstrated to be robust in these synthetic antiferromagnets under zero-field. Our first principal calculations and micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the formation of the antiferromagnetic skyrmions are due to nonuniformity of RKKY coupling associated with the proximity effect induced magnetic moments in the Pt and Ru layers. The skyrmions in the Pt and Ru layers adjacent to the Co layers lead to the observed topological Hall effect. This work not only provides insight into the effect of the magnetic proximity effect and RKKY coupling to the SAF skyrmions, but also an effective detection method for the SAF skyrmion systems, thereby laying a foundation for the practical application of antiferromagnetic skyrmions in spintronic devices.

Title: Two-Terminal Electrical Detection of the Néel Vector via Longitudinal Antiferromagnetic Nonreciprocal Transport
Authors: Guozhi Long, Hui Zeng, Mingxiang Pan, Wenhui Duan, Huaqing Huang
Abstract: We propose a robust two-terminal electrical readout scheme for detecting the Néel vector orientation in antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials by leveraging longitudinal nonreciprocal transport driven by quantum metric dipoles. Unlike conventional readout mechanisms, our approach does not require spin-polarized electrodes, tunneling junctions, or multi-terminal geometries, offering a universal and scalable solution for AFM spintronics. As examples, we demonstrate pronounced second-order longitudinal nonlinear conductivity (LNC) in two-dimensional (2D) MnS and 3D CuMnAs, both of which exhibit clear sign reversal of LNC under 180$^\circ$ Néel vector reorientation. We show that this LNC is predominantly governed by the intrinsic, relaxation-time-independent quantum metric mechanism rather than the extrinsic nonlinear Drude effect. Our findings provide a practical and material-general pathway for electrically reading AFM memory states, with promising implications for next-generation AFM spintronic technologies.

Title: Multicrossmodal Automated Agent for Integrating Diverse Materials Science Data
Authors: Adib Bazgir, Rama chandra Praneeth Madugula, Yuwen Zhang
Abstract: We introduce a multicrossmodal LLM-agent framework motivated by the growing volume and diversity of materials-science data ranging from high-resolution microscopy and dynamic simulation videos to tabular experiment logs and sprawling literature archives. While recent AI efforts have accelerated individual tasks such as property prediction or image classification, they typically treat each modality in isolation, leaving rich cross-modal correlations unexplored and forcing researchers to perform laborious manual integration. Moreover, existing multimodal foundation models often require expensive retraining or fine-tuning on domain data, and current multi-agent systems in materials informatics address only narrow subtasks. To overcome these obstacles, we design a coordinated team of specialized LLM agents, each equipped with domain-adapted prompts and plugins that project their outputs into a shared embedding space. A dynamic gating mechanism then weights and merges these insights, enabling unified reasoning over heterogeneous inputs without ever modifying the underlying LLM weights. We validate our approach on challenging case studies and demonstrate substantial gains in retrieval accuracy (85%), captioning fidelity, and integrated coverage (35%) compared to single-modality and zero-shot baselines. Our work paves the way for AI digital researchers capable of bridging data silos and accelerating the materials-discovery cycle. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: How to exploit driving and dissipation to stabilize and manipulate quantum many-body states
Authors: Iacopo Carusotto
Abstract: We review the basic concepts of quantum fluids of light and the different techniques that have been developed to exploit driving and dissipation to stabilize and manipulate interesting many-body states. In the weakly interacting regime, this approach has allowed to study, among other, superfluid light, non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation, photonic analogs of Hall effects, and is opening the way towards the realization of a new family of analog models of gravity. In the strongly interacting regime, the recent observations of Mott insulators and baby Laughlin fluids of light open promising avenues towards the study of novel strongly correlated many-body states.

Title: Bridging Two Dimensions: Luminescent Sensors at the Intersection of Temperature and Pressure
Authors: Lukasz Marciniak, Maja Szymczak, Przemyslaw Wozny, Marcin Runowski
Abstract: Luminescence thermometry and manometry are exponentially growing areas dealing with the optical detection of temperature and pressure, respectively, being appealing alternatives for conventional thermometers and manometers. The main benefit of luminescent thermometers and manometers is a possibility of remote temperature and/or pressure monitoring, in contrast to conventional gauges. Moreover, the use of luminescent nanoparticles as temperature/pressure sensors allow detection in micron- and nano-sized areas, previously inaccessible for conventional gauges. Therefore, the combination of both functionalities in a single material is highly appealing, as has been shown in a growing number of reports in the last years. Moreover, the bifunctional pressure and temperature sensors, operating with multiple independent spectroscopic parameters, allow simultaneous and distinct pressure and temperature readouts. However, the development of such truly bifunctional and reliable sensors is very challenging and rarely reported. This review summarizes the current status in the field, focusing on the sensing strategy and the selection of optically active sensor materials appropriate for a given application, including their sensitivity, spectral range of interest and pressure/temperature (in)dependence.

Title: Manipulating the hydrogen-induced insulator-metal transition through artificial microstructure engineering
Authors: Xuanchi Zhou, Xiaohui Yao, Wentian Lu, Jinjian Guo, Jiahui Ji, Lili Lang, Guowei Zhou, Chunwei Yao, Xiaomei Qiao, Huihui Ji, Zhe Yuan, Xiaohong Xu
Abstract: Hydrogen-associated filling-controlled Mottronics within electron-correlated system provides a groundbreaking paradigm to explore exotic physical functionality and phenomena. Dynamically controlling hydrogen-induced phase transitions through external fields offers a promising route for designing protonic devices in multidisciplinary fields, but faces high-speed bottlenecks owing to slow bulk diffusion of hydrogens. Here, we present a promising pathway to kinetically expedite hydrogen-related Mott transition in correlated VO2 system by taking advantage of artificial microstructure design. Typically, inclined domain boundary configuration and cR-faceted preferential orientation simultaneously realized in VO2/Al2O3 (102) heterostructure significantly lower the diffusion barrier via creating an unobstructed conduit for hydrogen diffusion. As a result, the achievable switching speed through hydrogenation outperforms that of counterpart grown on widely-reported c-plane Al2O3 substrate by 2-3 times, with resistive switching concurrently improved by an order of magnitude. Of particular interest, an anomalous uphill hydrogen diffusion observed for VO2 with a highway for hydrogen diffusion fundamentally deviates from basic Fick's law, unveiling a deterministic role of hydrogen spatial distribution in tailoring electronic state evolution. The present work not only provides a versatile strategy for manipulating ionic evolution, endowing with great potential in designing high-speed protonic devices, but also deepens the understanding of hydrogen-induced Mott transitions in electron-correlated system.

Title: Bonding relay for room-temperature oxide plasticity like metals
Authors: Xiangkai Chen, Yuhong Li, Xiaofei Zhu, Yun-Long Tang, Shi Liu
Abstract: Oxides have long been regarded as intrinsically brittle due to their strong, directional ionic or covalent bonds, in stark contrast to the ductile behavior of metals, where delocalized electron sharing enables plasticity through facile dislocation glide. Here, we challenge this paradigm by demonstrating that typical oxides, such as SrTiO3 and MgO, can exhibit room-temperature plasticity with pronounced crystallographic anisotropy. Through an integrated approach combining ab initio calculations, large scale molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental nanoindentation, we identify a universal structural criterion enabling room-temperature oxide plasticity: the presence of alternating positively and negatively charged atomic layers along specific slip directions, specifically the (1-10)[110] orientation in perovskite and rocksalt oxides. This charge alternating configuration enables a bonding relay mechanism, in which sequential bond breaking and reformation across the slip plane accompanied by interlayer persistent bonds mimics multi centered interactions in metals, thereby facilitating dislocation motion without catastrophic failure. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized pathway to achieving metal-like plasticity in oxides and establish a structural design principle for engineering flexible and mechanically resilient oxide materials.

Title: Multisetting protocol for Bell correlated states detection with spin-$f$ systems
Authors: Arkadiusz Kobus, Xinwei Li, Mariusz Gajda, Li You, Emilia Witkowska
Abstract: We propose a multisetting protocol for the detection of two-body Bell correlations, and apply it to spin-nematic squeezed states realized in $f$ pairs of SU(2) subsystems within spin-$f$ atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Experimental data for $f=1$, alongside with numerical simulations using the truncated Wigner method for $f=1,\,2,\,3$, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol. Our findings extend the reach of multisetting Bell tests in ultracold atomic system, paving the way for extended quantum information processing in high-spin ensemble platforms.

Title: Stabilization of Martensite and Austenite Phases and Realization of Two-way Martensitic Transition in Co-Ni-Ga Ferromagnetic Shape Memory Alloy Nanoparticles
Authors: Debraj Mahata, Ananthakrishnan Srinivasana
Abstract: Three sets of Co-Ni-Ga alloy nanoparticles have been synthesized by a template-free chemical route. Structural, morphological, shape memory, and magnetic properties of room temperature martensite (M) phase, dual (M + secondary $\gamma$) phase and austenite (A) phase Co-Ni-Ga nanoparticles are reported. Temperature-dependent XRD analysis revealed that $Co_{36}Ni_{36}Ga_{28}$ nanoparticles exhibiting a single M phase at room temperature, completely transform to A phase at $\sim1000$ K. Upon cooling to room temperature, the A phase transforms back to single M phase, confirming the two-way martensitic transition in Co-Ni-Ga nanoparticles. Structural analysis shows that the $\gamma$-phase does not influence the martensitic transition of bi-phasic (M + $\gamma$) $Co_{41}Ni_{34}Ga_{25}$ nanoparticles. These nanoparticles display saturation magnetization ranging from 2.9 emu/g to 15.3 emu/g at room temperature. The $\gamma$ phase could be introduced in A phase $Co_{44}Ni_{26}Ga_{30}$ nanoparticles when heated up to 1073 K. Curie temperatures of A and M phases are higher than the martensitic transition temperatures in all the samples, qualifying them as ferromagnetic shape memory alloy nanoparticles. Observation of M $\leftrightarrow$ A phase transition, Co-Ni-Ga nanoparticles with tunable magnetic properties make them excellent candidates for low and high temperature nanoactuators and other ferromagnetic shape memory applications.

Title: Procedure of tuning up a three-site artificial Kitaev chain based on transmon measurements
Authors: Xiaozhou Yang, Zhaozheng Lyu, Xiang Wang, Enna Zhuo, Yunxiao Zhang, Duolin Wang, Yukun Shi, Yuyang Huang, Bing Li, Xiaohui Song, Peiling Li, Bingbing Tong, Ziwei Dou, Jie Shen, Guangtong Liu, Fanming Qu, Li Lu
Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains (AKCs), formed of quantum dot-superconductor linear arrays, provide a promising platform for hosting Majorana bound states (MBSs) and implementing topological quantum computing. The main challenges along this research direction would include the tuning up of AKCs for hosting MBSs and the readout of the parity of the chains. In this work, we present a step-by-step procedure for tuning up a three-site AKC to its sweet spots based on the spectra of a transmon circuit which is integrated with the chain for the purpose of reading out the parity of the chain. The signatures of the transmon's plasma modes in each step, particular those related to the appearance of MBSs in the chain, will be given. We find that the sweet spots in a three-site AKC can be classified into three types based on the relative strengths of elastic cotunneling (ECT) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR): ECT-dominated sweet spots, genuine sweet spots and CAR-dominated sweet spots. We show that the ECT-dominated and CAR-dominated sweet spots can be more conveniently accessed and utilized in transmon-based measurements.

Title: Subgap pumping of antiferromagnetic Mott insulators: photoexcitation mechanisms and applications
Authors: Radu Andrei, Mingyao Guo, Mustafa Ali, Hoon Kim, Richard D. Averitt, David Hsieh, Eugene Demler
Abstract: We study the behavior of the 2D repulsive Hubbard model on a square lattice at half filling, under strong driving with ac electric fields, by employing a time-dependent Gaussian variational approach. Within the same theoretical framework, we analytically obtain the conventional Keldysh crossover between multiphoton and tunneling photoexcitation mechanisms, as well as two new regimes beyond the Keldysh paradigm. We discuss how dynamical renormalization of the Mott-Hubbard gap feeds back into the photoexcitation process, modulating the carrier generation rate in real time. The momentum distribution of quasiparticle excitations immediately after the drive is calculated, and shown to contain valuable information about the generation mechanism. Finally, we discuss experimental probing of the pump-induced nonequilibrium electronic state.

Title: Multiplexed holographic molecular binding assays with internal calibration standards
Authors: Kaitlynn Snyder, Andrew D. Hollingsworth, Fook Chiong Cheong, Rushna Quddus, David G. Grier
Abstract: Holographic molecular binding assays detect macromolecules binding to colloidal probe beads by monitoring nanometer-scale changes in the beads' diameters with holographic microscopy. Measured changes are interpreted with Maxwell Garnett effective-medium theory to infer the surface coverage of analyte molecules and therefore to measure the analyte concentration in solution. The precision and accuracy of those measurements can be degraded by run-to-run instrumental variations, which introduce systematic errors in the holographic characterization measurements. We detect and mitigate these errors by introducing a class of inert reference beads whose polymer brush coating resists macromolecular binding. The holographically measured diameter and refractive index of those beads serve as internal standards for THC measurements. To characterize the reference beads, we introduce a general all-optical method to measure the grafting density of the polymer brush that combines holographic characterization of the bead diameter with a refractometry measurement of the polymer's specific volume. The latter technique shows the specific volume of poly(ethylene oxide) to be 1.308(4) cubic nanometers per kilodalton. We use this suite of techniques to demonstrate a multiplexed immunoassay for immunoglobulin G (IgG) whose success validates the effective-medium analysis of holographic characterization measurements. Internal negative controls provided by the reference beads are validated by negative control measurements on alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which has a similar molecular weight to IgG but does not bind to the probe beads' binding sites.

Title: Density modulations in active colloidal systems through orthogonal propulsion control and sensory delays
Authors: Ueli Töpfer, Maximilian R. Bailey, Sanjay Schreiber, Federico Paratore, Lucio Isa
Abstract: Recent advancements in active colloidal systems aim to mimic key characteristics of biological microswimmers, particularly their adaptive motility in response to environmental changes. While many approaches rely on externally imposing a propulsive force, achieving true autonomous and self-regulating adaptation to the environment remains limited. In this study, we develop and analyze Janus microswimmers driven by electrohydrodynamic flows that autonomously adjust their propulsion dynamics in response to varying illumination conditions. Our Janus particles are silica colloids partially coated with titania, which self-propel via induced-charge electrophoresis (ICEP) under uniform AC electric fields. Since titania is photoconductive, it increases its conductivity under UV illumination, which thereby regulates the propulsion velocity independently of and orthogonally to the applied electric field. Crucially, the velocity adaptation requires a finite time. This sensory delay, which we systematically characterize, leads to enhanced microswimmer localization in response to spatiotemporal light modulations compared to the typical case of instantaneous response considered for synthetic microswimmers. By harnessing these dynamics, akin to those of biological microswimmers, we exert precise control over both local and global particle behavior, presenting novel opportunities for adaptive active matter systems.

Abstract: The crystallographic structure of iron under extreme conditions is a key benchmark for cutting-edge experimental and numerical methods. Moreover, it plays a crucial role in understanding planetary cores, as it significantly influences the interpretation of observational data and, consequently, insights into their internal structure and dynamics. However, even the structure of pure solid iron under the Earth's core conditions remains uncertain, with the commonly expected hexagonal close-packed structure energetically competitive with various cubic lattices. In this study, iron was compressed in a diamond anvil cell to above 200 GPa, and dynamically probed near the melting point using MHz frequency X-ray pulses from the European X-ray Free Electron Laser. The emergence of an additional diffraction line at high temperatures suggests the formation of an entropically stabilized bcc structure. Rapid heating and cooling cycles captured intermediate phases, offering new insights into iron's phase transformation paths. The appearance of the bcc phase near melting at extreme pressures challenges current understanding of the iron phase diagram under Earth's core conditions.

Title: Controlling quantum phases with electric fields in one-dimensional Hubbard systems
Authors: D. Arisa, R. M. Dos Santos, Isaac M. Carvalho, Vivian V. França
Abstract: Quantum systems under electric fields provide a powerful framework for uncovering and controlling novel quantum phases, especially in low-dimensional systems with strong correlations. In this work, we investigate quantum phase transitions induced by an electric potential difference in a one-dimensional half-filled Hubbard chain. By analyzing (i) tunneling and pairing mechanisms, (ii) charge and spin gaps, and (iii) entanglement between the chain halves, we identify three distinct phases: Mott insulator, metal and band-like insulator. The metallic regime, characterized by the closing of both charge and spin gaps, is accompanied by a field-dependent kinetic energy and a quasi-periodic oscillatory behavior of pairing response and entanglement. Although the metallic phase persists for different magnetizations, its extent in the phase diagram shrinks as spin polarization increases.

Title: All-electrical near-field injection of excitons in a van der Waals antiferromagnet
Authors: Jonas D. Ziegler, Sotirios Papadopoulos, Antti J. Moilanen, Marcelo M. Valenzuela, Qia Lin, Kseniia Mosina, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Zdenek Sofer, Florian Dirnberger, Lukas Novotny
Abstract: Van der Waals materials have become a promising building block for future electronics and photonics. The two-dimensional magnet CrSBr came into the spotlight of solid state research due to its intriguing combination of antiferromagnetic order, strong light-matter coupling and unusual quasi-1D electronic bandstructure. This study reports the electrical excitation of excitons in CrSBr layers from cryogenic temperatures up to room temperature. By exploiting the energy transfer via tunneling electrons in a graphene tunnel junction strongly bound excitons are excited in proximate CrSBr layers. This facilitates electrically-excited emission from CrSBr crystals ranging in thickness from a bilayer up to 250 nm, in which the strong linear polarization of the electroluminescence confirms the excitonic origin. For thicker layers, clear evidence for the electrically excited emission from self-hybridized exciton polaritons is observed, highlighting the strong coupling between optical excitations and confined photon modes in CrSBr. These results pave the way for future applications in spintronic and optical readout of magnetic properties.

Title: Entropy exchange in an inter-correlating binary quasi-classical system: Concept of entropy-bath accelerated molecular dynamics
Authors: Projesh Kumar Roy
Abstract: This letter highlights the entropy exchange phenomenon in a coupled binary inter-correlating system following Haldane's non-linear statistical correlation. A unique coupling between a classical and a quantum-like system at the marginal distribution is observed. It is shown that the quantum nature of a system can arise without any self-correlation. Extending this idea, an enhanced sampling method in molecular dynamics simulation is postulated where a classical system is forced to show quantum-like behavior with the help of an entropy-bath. An entropy-bath exchanges entropy with the system to scale the potential energy distribution of the system, so that a probability upper bound at each energy level is maintained. An algorithm to implement the entropy-bath accelerated molecular dynamics simulation is discussed. Using low temperature vitreous silica as an example, the capability of such an algorithm to greatly improve sampling of the potential energy landscape under equilibrium conditions for kinetically arrested systems is highlighted.

Title: Chemical design of monolayer altermagnets
Authors: Runzhang Xu, Yifan Gao, Junwei Liu
Abstract: The crystal-symmetry-paired spin-momentum locking (CSML) arisen from the intrinsic crystal symmetry connecting different magnetic sublattices in altermagnets enables many exotic spintronics properties such as unconventional piezomagnetism and noncollinear spin current. However, the shortage of monolayer altermagnets restricts further exploration of dimensionally confined phenomena and applications of nanostructured devices. Here, we propose general chemical design principles inspired by sublattice symmetry of layered altermagnet V$_2$(Se,Te)$_2$O through symmetry-preserving structural modification and valence-adaptive chemical substitutions. In total, we construct 2600 candidates across four structural frameworks, M$_2$A$_2$B$_{1,0}$ and their Janus derivatives. High-throughput calculations identify 670 potential altermagnets with Néel-ordered ground states, among which 91 ones exhibiting CSML Dirac cones that enable spin-polarized ultra-fast transport. These materials also feature different ground-state magnetic orderings and demonstrate diverse electronic behaviors, ranging from semiconductors, metals, half-metals, to Dirac semimetals. This work not only reveals abundant monolayer altermagnets, but also establishes a rational principle for their design, opening gates for exploration of confined magnetism and spintronics in atomically thin systems.

Title: Eu-doped CsSrCl$_3$ Large Nanocrystal Clusters with Self-Reduction Effect and Near-Unity Quantum Yield
Authors: Chuangchang Lei, Xiang Wu, Yaohua Li, Xu Xu, Guangzheng Zuo, Qiongrong Ou, Shuyu Zhang
Abstract: Europium halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for environmental-friendly blue-emitting materials. However, their development is hindered by relative low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY, e.g. ~2-5% for intrinsic CsEuCl3) and poor stability against air. Here, we introduce a one-step-procedure for synthesizing Eu$^{2+}$-doped CsSrCl$_3$ large nanocrystal clusters (LNCs) with the effect of self-reduction, therefore eliminating the use of conventional reductant oleylamine (OAm) and ensuring phase purity. The CsSrCl$_3$:Eu LNCs shows photoluminescence emission centered at 430 nm with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 25 nm and a PLQY of ~40%, which can be further enhanced to ~97% after passivating the surface defects by adding trioctylphosphine (TOP), the highest among all reported lead-free blue-emitting perovskite nanocrystals. The stability of CsSrCl$_3$:Eu can also be improved significantly by epitaxially growing ZnS shell on the surface. This work will shed more light on lanthanide and alkaline-earth metal (AEM)-based perovskites for nontoxic light-emitting materials.

Title: Mott transition and correlation effects on strictly localized states in an octagonal quasicrystal
Authors: Efe Yelesti, Onur Erten, M. O. Oktel
Abstract: Flat-band systems have attracted significant attention as platforms for studying strongly correlated electron physics, where the dominance of electron-electron interactions over kinetic energy gives rise to a variety of emergent phenomena. Quasicrystals are compelling systems for studying these phenomena as they host degenerate strictly localized states at zero energy due to perfect destructive interference patterns. In this study, we use the slave-rotor mean-field approach to investigate the effects of electron interactions within the Hubbard model on the Ammann-Beenker quasicrystal. The phase diagram characterizing metallic and Mott insulator regions indicates a first-order phase transition. Our analysis shows that the local coordination number affects the local quasiparticle weight, displaying varying metallicity across the sites. Furthermore, we focus on the strictly localized states that arise in the non-interacting limit. We find that interactions and deviation from particle-hole symmetry induce spectral splitting, broadening, and partial delocalization of the localized states, depending on the local environment. In particular, certain localized states with higher coordination numbers remain more robust compared to others. Our results highlight the critical role of local geometry in shaping correlation effects in flat-band quasicrystals.

Title: First-principles calculations of transport coefficients in Weyl semimetal TaAs
Authors: Guillaume E. Allemand, Matteo Giantomassi, Matthieu J. Verstraete
Abstract: We study charge and heat transport from first-principles in the topological Weyl semimetal TaAs. Electron-phonon coupling matrix elements are calculated using density functional perturbation theory and used to derive the thermo-electric transport coefficients, including the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, electronic thermal conductivity and the Peltier coefficient. We compare the self-energy and momentum relaxation time approximations to the iterative solution of the Boltzmann Transport Equation, finding they give similar results for TaAs provided the chemical potential is treated accurately. For the iterative method, we derive an additional equation, which is needed to fully solve for transport under both thermal and an electrical potential gradients. Interestingly, the Onsager reciprocity between $S$ and $\Pi$ is no longer imposed, and we can deal with systems breaking time-reversal symmetry, in particular magnetic materials. We compare our results with the available experimental data for TaAs: the agreement is excellent for $\sigma_{xx}$, while $\sigma_{zz}$ is overestimated, probably due to differences in experimental carrier concentrations. The Seebeck coefficient is of the same order of magnitude in theory and experiments, and we find that its low-T behavior also strongly depends on the doping level.

Title: Exciton-defect interaction and optical properties from a first-principles T-matrix approach
Authors: Yang-hao Chan, Jonah B. Haber, Mit H. Naik, Diana Y. Qiu, Felipe H. da Jornada
Abstract: Understanding exciton-defect interactions is critical for optimizing optoelectronic and quantum information applications in many materials. However, ab initio simulations of material properties with defects are often limited to high defect density. Here, we study effects of exciton-defect interactions on optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra in monolayer MoS2 using a first-principles T-matrix approach. We demonstrate that exciton-defect bound states can be captured by the disorder-averaged Green's function with the T-matrix approximation and further analyze their optical properties. Our approach yields photoluminescence spectra in good agreement with experiments and provides a new, computationally efficient framework for simulating optical properties of disordered 2D materials from first-principles.

Title: Tailoring the Electronic Configurations of YPc$_2$ on Cu(111): Decoupling Strategies for Molecular Spin Qubits Platforms
Authors: Soyoung Oh, Franklin. H. Cho, We-hyo Soe, Jisoo Yu, Hong Bui, Lukas Spree, Caroline Hommel, Wonjun Jang, Soo-hyon Phark, Luciano Colazzo, Christoph Wolf, Fabio Donati
Abstract: Among molecular spin qubit candidates, yttrium phthalocyanine double-decker (YPc$_2$) features a diamagnetic metal ion core that stabilizes the molecular structure, while its magnetic properties arise primarily from an unpaired electron (S = 1/2) delocalized over the phthalocyanine (Pc) ligand. Understanding its properties in the proximity of metal electrodes is crucial to assess its potential use in molecular spin qubits architectures. Here, we investigated the morphology and electronic structure of this molecule adsorbed on a metal Cu(111) surface using scanning tunneling microscopy. On that surface, YPc$_2$ adsorbs flat, with isolated molecules showing a preferred orientation along the (111) crystal axes. We observed two different types of self-assembly molecular packing when growing the molecular patches on Cu(111). For YPc$_2$ in direct contact with Cu(111), scanning tunneling spectroscopy revealed a widely separated highest occupied (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO), suggesting the quenching of the unpaired spin. Conversely, when the YPc$_2$ is separated from the substrate by a few-layer thick diamagnetic ZnPc layer, we find the HOMO to split into singly occupied (SOMO) and singly unoccupied molecular orbitals (SUMO). We find that more than 2 layers of ZnPc are needed to avoid intermixing between the two molecules and spin quenching in the YPc$_2$. Density functional theory reveals the spin quenching to be due to the hybridization between YPc$_2$ and Cu(111) states, confirming the importance of using suitable decoupling layers to preserve the unpaired molecular spin. Our results suggest the potential of YPc$_2$/ZnPc heterostructures as a stable and effective molecular spin qubit platform and validates the possibility of integrating this molecular spin qubit candidate in future quantum logic devices.

Title: Exciton Bohr radius of lead halide perovskites for photovoltaic and light-emitting applications
Authors: Hyun Myung Jang, Kyung Yeon Jang, Song Hee Lee, Jinwoo Park, Tae-Woo Lee
Abstract: Exciton Bohr radius (a_B) and exciton binding energy (E_b) of metal halide perovskites are two prime quantities in their applications to both light-emitting diode displays and photovoltaic devices. We develop a reliable theoretical method of simultaneously finding a_B and {\epsilon}_r^c (dielectric constant) based on the net exciton energy above the bulk band gap. It is estimated that a_B under the dielectric confinement is substantially smaller than a_B in the absence of dielectric confinement: 4.36 nm vs. 5.61 nm in the case of CH3NH3PbBr3. We attribute the enhanced a_B to variations of {\epsilon}_r^c and the electron-hole correlation energy. We also develop a simple method of finding E_b based on the same net exciton energy. Using this, we attribute the well-known difference in E_b between organic bromide perovskites and iodide counterparts to {\epsilon}_r^c and explain that iodide perovskites are more suited than bromide counterparts in photovoltaic applications, which require smaller E_b for efficient charge-carriers transport.

Title: Triplet Excitons Reconcile Charge Generation and Recombination in Low-Offset Organic Solar Cells: Efficiency Limits from a 5-State Model
Authors: Jonathan L. Langentepe-Kong, Manasi Pranav, Safa Shoaee, Dieter Neher
Abstract: The power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells has recently improved beyond 20%. The active layers of these devices comprise of at least two organic semiconductors, forming a type II heterojunction. Hereby, the device performance is determined by the kinetic interplay of various species, including localized excitons, charge transfer state as well as charge-separated states. However, a model which describes all relevant photovoltaic measures has yet to be developed. Herein, we present a comprehensive 5-state rate model which includes both singlet and triplet charge transfer states and takes into account the formation, re-splitting and decay of the local triplet state, parametric in the respective energy offset. We show that this model not only describes key device properties such as charge generation efficiency, photoluminescence, electroluminescence and Langevin reduction factor simultaneously but also elucidate how these vary across material combinations based on the D:A interfacial energy offset alone. We find that the electroluminescence and Langevin reduction factor depend strongly on the triplet properties and that the triplet decay becomes the dominant charge recombination pathway for systems with moderate offset, in full agreement to previous experimental results. Validation against literature data demonstrates the model's ability to predict the device efficiency accurately. Subsequently, we identify material combinations with singlet exciton to charge transfer state energetic offset of roughly 150meV as particularly promising. Our model explains further why recent certified efficiency records for binary blends remain at ca. 20% if no further means to improve photon and charge carrier harvesting are taken.

Title: Entanglement of Inhomogeneous Free Bosons and Orthogonal Polynomials
Authors: Pierre-Antoine Bernard, Rafael I. Nepomechie, Gilles Parez, Eric Ragoucy, David Raveh, Luc Vinet
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ground-state entanglement entropy in inhomogeneous free-boson models in one spatial dimension. We develop a powerful method to extract the leading term in the entanglement scaling, based on the analytic properties of the inhomogeneous potential. This method is applicable to a broad class of models with smooth spatial inhomogeneities. As a case study, we apply this approach for a family of exactly-solvable models characterized by orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme, finding a perfect match between the numerical and analytical results.

Title: Congestion and extreme events in urban street networks
Authors: Ajay Agarwal, M. S. Santhanam
Abstract: Congestion and extreme events in transportation networks are emergent phenomena with significant socio-economic implications. In this work, we study congestion and extreme event properties on real urban street (planar) networks drawn from four cities and compare it with that on a regular square grid. For dynamics, we employ three variants of random walk with additional realistic transport features. In all the four urban street networks and 2D square grid and with all dynamical models, phase transitions are observed from a free flow to congested phase as a function of birth rate of vehicles. These transitions can be modified by traffic-aware routing protocols, but congestion cannot be entirely mitigated. In organically evolved street networks, we observe a semi-congested regime which has both congested and free-flow components. In the free-flow regime, the extreme event occurrence probability is larger for small degree nodes than for hubs, a feature originally observed in non-planar scale-free networks. In general, with respect to congestion and extreme events, the urban street networks and regular square grid display similar properties.

Abstract: Alkali metal intercalation is an important strategy for doping van der Waals materials. Lithium, in particular, was shown to achieve exceptional charge carrier densities, reaching levels at which fundamental electrical, optical, and magnetic material properties begin to be strongly modified. While lithium is known to be highly volatile, its migration dynamics in anisotropic layered crystals remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the intercalation of lithium in-between layers of the anisotropic magnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Using exfoliated crystals, we are able to monitor the dynamics of the intercalation process in real time through optical and electrical characterization methods. Our measurements reveal highly anisotropic migration of Lithium characterized by diffusion coefficients that differ by more than one order of magnitude along a- and b-directions. This finding is in good agreement with our molecular dynamics simulations which show trajectories of lithium atoms primarily follow the Br-chains in the a-direction. Beyond that, we find that partially covering CrSBr crystals by thin hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes has a significant impact on the intercalation process, and that lithium strongly enhances the electrical conductivity along the a-axis. Our method offers a new platform for lithium diffusion studies and encourages further research to pursue the fabrication of lithium-doped devices.

Title: Shubnikov-de Haas Oscillations in 2D $\text{PtSe}_2$: A fermiological Charge Carrier Investigation
Authors: Julian Max Salchegger, Rajdeep Adhikari, Bogdan Faina, Alberta Bonanni
Abstract: High magnetic field and low temperature transport is carried out in order to characterize the charge carriers of $\text{PtSe}_2$. In particular, the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations arising at applied magnetic field strengths $\gtrsim 4.5\,\text{T}$ are found to occur exclusively in plane and emerge at a layer thickness of $\approx 18\,\text{nm}$, increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency for thinner $\text{PtSe}_2$ flakes. Moreover, the quantum transport time, Berry phase, Dingle temperature and cyclotron mass of the charge carriers are ascertained. The emergence of weak antilocalization (WAL) lies in contrast to the presence of magnetic moments from Pt vacancies. An explanation is provided on how WAL and the Kondo effect can be observed within the same material. Detailed information about the charge carriers and transport phenomena in $\text{PtSe}_2$ is obtained, which is relevant for the design of prospective spintronic and orbitronic devices and for the realization of orbital Hall effect-based architectures.

Title: Coupling quantum spin ice to matter on the centered pyrochlore lattice
Authors: Rajah P. Nutakki, Sylvain Capponi, Ludovic D. C. Jaubert, Lode Pollet
Abstract: The low-energy physics of quantum spin ice is known to support an emergent form of quantum electrodynamics (QED), where magnetic monopoles exist and the fine structure constant is material dependent. In this article, we show how this QED is modified via a coupling to dynamical matter on the centered pyrochlore lattice, a structure which has recently been synthesized using metal-organic frameworks. Specifically, we study the low-energy properties of the S = 1/2 quantum XXZ model on the centered pyrochlore lattice. At fourth order in degenerate perturbation theory, this model hosts a quantum spin liquid distinct from the well-known U(1) quantum spin ice on the pyrochlore due to the presence of dynamical matter in the ground state. Exact diagonalization results are consistent with this quantum spin liquid over an extended region of the ground state phase diagram although potential quantum critical points within this region could indicate a richer phase structure. Our work thus expands the physics of quantum spin ice in an experimentally motivated geometry, providing the framework for understanding how the emergent QED behaves in the presence of dynamical matter.

Abstract: The recent discovery of ferroelectric nematics-genuine 3D ferroelectric fluids-has underscored the importance of electrostatic interactions in shaping the physical behaviour of soft matter systems. In this paper, we investigate the mechanical properties of ferroelectric nematics by directly comparing the splay and twist elastic constants in a liquid crystal system that exhibits both nonpolar and ferroelectric nematic phases. Our results reveal that polar ordering results in increased splay rigidity and a concomitant reduction in twist elasticity.

Title: Linear scaling relation between two-dimensional massless Dirac fermion Fermi velocity and Fe-As bond length in iron arsenide superconductor systems
Authors: Chengpu Lv, Jianzhou Zhao, Yueshan Xu, Yu Song, Chenglin Zhang, Mykhaylo Ozerov, Pengcheng Dai, Nan-Lin Wang, Zhi-Guo Chen
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) massless Dirac fermions (MDF), which represent a type of quasi-particles with linear energy-momentum dispersions only in 2D momentum space, provide a fertile ground for realizing novel quantum phenomena. However, 2D MDF were seldom observed in the superconducting bulk states of 3D materials. Furthermore, as a cornerstone for accurately tuning the quantum phenomena based on 2D MDF, a quantitative relationship between 2D MDF and a structural parameter has rarely been revealed so far. Here, we report magneto-infrared spectroscopy studies of the iron-arsenide-superconductor systems NaFeAs and $A\mathrm{Fe_2As_2} (A = \mathrm{Ca, Ba})$ at temperature $T \sim 4.2 $ K and at magnetic fields ($B$) up to 17.5 T. Our results demonstrate the existence of 2D MDF in the superconducting bulk state of NaFeAs. Moreover, the 2D-MDF Fermi velocities in NaFeAs and $A\mathrm{Fe_2As_2} (A = \mathrm{Ca, Ba})$, which are extracted from the slopes of the linear $\sqrt{B}$ dependences of the Landau-level transition energies, scale linearly with the Fe-As bond lengths. The linear scaling between the 2D-MDF Fermi velocities and the Fe-As bond lengths is supported by (i) the linear relationship between the square root of the effective mass of the $d_{xy}$ electrons and the Fe-As bond length and (ii) the linear dependence of the square root of the calculated tight-binding hopping energy on the Fe-As bond length. Our results open up new avenues for exploring and tuning novel quantum phenomena based on 2D MDF in the superconducting bulk states of 3D materials.

Title: Majorana Zero Modes in a Heterogenous Structure of Topological and Trivial Domains in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$
Authors: Prashant Gupta, Jasmin Bedow, Eric Mascot, Dirk K. Morr
Abstract: We propose that the existence of vortices in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ with and without Majoarana zero modes (MZMs) can be explained by a heterogeneous mixture of strong topological and trivial superconducting domains, with only vortices in the former exhibiting MZMs. We identify the spectroscopic signatures of topological and trivial vortices and show that they are necessarily separated by a domain wall harboring Majorana edge modes. We demonstrate that when a vortex is moved from a trivial to a topological domain in real time, a domain wall Majorana edge mode is transferred to the vortex as an MZM.

Title: Electric-Magnetic Duality for Symmetric Tensor Gauge Theories and Immobile $p$-branes
Authors: Ryuki Makino, Shin Sasaki, Kenta Shiozawa
Abstract: We study electric-magnetic duality in Lorentz invariant symmetric tensor gauge theories, where immobile charged particles - fractons - arise due to the generalized current conservation $\partial_{\mu} \partial_{\nu} J^{\mu \nu} = 0$ and the fracton gauge principle. We show that the duality in the symmetric gauge theories holds only in four-dimensional spacetime. In higher dimensions, the duality does not hold with only the symmetric gauge fields but tensor fields with more complex symmetries come into play. Furthermore, we show that a hierarchy for the symmetric gauge field theories of higher ranks is interpreted by the bi-form calculus. We also discuss the restricted immobility of $p$-branes in the mixed symmetric gauge theories. As a byproduct, we find that novel self-duality conditions are defined as BPS equations in the four-dimensional Euclidean space.

Title: Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos
Authors: Naga Dileep Varikuti, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.

Title: Bell sampling in Quantum Monte Carlo simulations
Authors: Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Yi-Ming Ding
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are essential for the numerical study of large-scale quantum many-body systems, yet their utility has been significantly hampered by the difficulty in computing key quantities such as off-diagonal operators and entanglement. This work introduces Bell-QMC, a novel QMC framework leveraging Bell sampling, a two-copy measurement protocol in the transversal Bell basis. We demonstrate that Bell-QMC enables an efficient and unbiased estimation of both challenging classes of observables, offering a significant advantage over previous QMC approaches. Notably, the entanglement across all system partitions can be computed in a single Bell-QMC simulation. We implement this method within the stochastic series expansion (SSE), where we design an efficient update scheme for sampling the configurations in the Bell basis. We demonstrate our algorithm in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, extracting universal quantum features using only simple diagonal measurements. This work establishes Bell-QMC as a powerful framework that significantly expands the accessible quantum properties in QMC simulations, providing an exponential advantage over conventional QMC.

Title: Exact spin helix eigenstates in anisotropic spin-$s$ Heisenberg model in arbitrary dimensions
Authors: Mingchen Zheng, Chenguang Liang, Shu Chen, Xin Zhang
Abstract: Spin-helix states are exact eigenstates of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ Heisenberg chain characterized by spatially modulated spin textures appearing under special parameter conditions. In this work, we generalize this framework and construct exact spin helix eigenstates in the fully anisotropic XYZ Heisenberg model, extending to higher spatial dimensions and spin representations, which reveals new stabilization mechanisms beyond integrability. The XXZ and XY limits are also analyzed to clarify the properties and constraints of these spin helix eigenstates. Our results broaden the class of analytically tractable exact eigenstates in quantum spin systems and deepen understanding of spatially inhomogeneous states in complex many-body systems.

Title: Gap modes in Arnold tongues and their topological origins
Authors: Andrew Brown, Hong Qin
Abstract: Gap modes in a modified Mathieu equation, perturbed by a Dirac delta potential, are investigated. It is proved that the modified Mathieu equation admits stable isolated gap modes with topological origins in the unstable regions of the Mathieu equation, which are known as Arnold tongues. The modes may be identified as localized electron wavefunctions in a 1D chain or as toroidal Alfvén eigenmodes. A generalization of this argument shows that gap modes can be induced in regimes of instability by localized potential perturbations for a large class of periodic Hamiltonians.

Title: Non-Factorizing Interface in the Two-Dimensional Long-Range Ising Model
Authors: Dongsheng Ge, Yu Nakayama
Abstract: The factorization proposal claims that the co-dimension one "pinning defect", on which a local relevant operator is integrated, factorizes the space into two halves in general conformal field theories in the infrared limit. In this letter, we study a two-dimensional long-range Ising model at criticality with a line defect or an interface, which physically corresponds to changing the local temperature on it. We show that in the perturbative regime, it is not factorizing even in the infrared limit. An intuitive explanation of the non-factorization is that the long-range Ising model is equivalent to a local conformal field theory in higher dimensions. In this picture, the space is still connected through the "extra dimension" across the defect line.

Title: High-Throughput Mechanical Characterization of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles by Real-Time Deformability Cytometry
Authors: Maximilian Kloppe, Stefan J. Maurer, Tobias Abele, Kerstin Göpfrich, Sebastian Aland
Abstract: Real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) enables high-throughput, contact-free mechanical characterization of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). However, the interpretation of vesicle deformation under flow has been hindered by the absence of a suitable theoretical or computational framework. Here, we present a simulation-based model that describes GUV deformation in RT-DC, taking into account the surface dilational elastic modulus as the dominant mechanical parameter. Using phase-field simulations over a wide parameter space, we find GUV deformation to depend linearly on GUV area. Based on these results, we derive two complementary fitting strategies for extracting the surface dilational modulus K from RT-DC data: a direct model-based fit for single-vesicle characterization and a noise-resistant collective approach that enables robust population-level estimates. Furthermore, we introduce a combined fitting method that integrates both approaches to filter outliers and improve accuracy in heterogeneous or noisy datasets. All methods scale across varying flow rates, channel geometries and buffer viscosities, and produce predictions of K consistent with literature values for different lipid compositions. Compared to traditional techniques such as micropipette aspiration, our approach offers orders of magnitude higher throughput without mechanical contact, making it particularly suitable for GUV population studies. Beyond mechanical phenotyping, this framework opens new avenues for sorting vesicle populations based on membrane mechanics, a capability of growing interest in synthetic biology and soft matter research.

Title: Hyperscaling of Fidelity and Operator Estimations in the Critical Manifold
Authors: Matheus Henrique Martins Costa, Flavio de Souza Nogueira, Jeroen van den Brink
Abstract: By formulating the renormalization group as a quantum channel acting on density matrices in Quantum Field Theories (QFTs), we show that ground-state expectation values of observables supported on slow momentum modes can be approximated by their averages on the fixed-point theories to which the QFTs flow. This is done by studying the fidelity between ground states of different QFTs and arriving at certain hyperscaling relations satisfied at criticality. Our results allow for a clear identification of cases in which one can replace a QFT by its scale-invariant limit in the calculation of expectation values, opening the way for the application of numerical and analytical methods to as of yet difficult computer simulation of critical models.

Title: Uhlmann and scalar Wilczek-Zee phases of degenerate quantum systems
Authors: Xin Wang, Hao Guo, Chih-Chun Chien
Abstract: The Wilczek-Zee (WZ) holonomy arises in degenerate states while the Uhlmann holonomy characterizes finite-temperature topology. We investigate possible relationships between the Uhlmann phase and the scalar WZ phase, which reflects the Uhlmann and WZ holonomy respectively, in an exemplary four-level model with two doubly degenerate subspaces. Through exactly solutions, we contrast the behavior of the Uhlmann and WZ connections and their associated phases. In the zero-temperature limit, the Uhlmann phase may or may not agree with the scalar WZ phase of the degenerate ground states due to the underlying topology. Some conditions are derived in an analytic analysis, under which the Uhlmann phase in the zero-temperature limit converges to the scalar WZ phase. We also briefly discuss possible realizations or simulations of the phenomena as well as their implications.

Title: Analysis and Simulation of Generalized Langevin Equations with Non-Gaussian Orthogonal Forces
Authors: Henrik Kiefer, Benjamin J. A. Héry, Lucas Tepper, Benjamin A. Dalton, Cihan Ayaz, Roland R. Netz
Abstract: The generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is a useful framework for analyzing and modeling the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of low-dimensional reaction coordinates, with its specific form determined by the choice of projection formalism. We compare parameters derived from different GLE formulations using molecular dynamics simulations of butane's dihedral angle dynamics. Our analysis reveals non-Gaussian contributions of the orthogonal force in different GLEs, being most enhanced for the Mori-GLE, where all non-linearities are relegated to the orthogonal force. We establish a simulation technique that correctly accounts for non-Gaussian orthogonal forces, which is critical for accurately predicting dihedral-angle mean first-passage times. We find that the accuracy of GLE simulations depends significantly on the chosen GLE formalism; the Mori-GLE offers the most numerically robust framework for capturing the statistical observables of the dihedral angle dynamics, provided the correct non-Gaussian orthogonal force distribution is used.

Title: Dissipative phase transition of interacting non-reciprocal fermions
Authors: Rafael D. Soares, Matteo Brunelli, Marco Schirò
Abstract: We study an interacting fermionic chain in the presence of non-reciprocal gain and loss processes obtained via reservoir engineering. The interplay between unitary evolution and the two dissipative processes leads to distinct non-reciprocal signatures in the transient dynamics and the steady state. These include a transition from exponential to power-law relaxation towards a finite-density steady-state, a nonzero particle current from breaking inversion symmetry, and dynamics under open boundary conditions showing directionality and charge accumulation. Weak interactions preserve the main signatures of non-reciprocity, enriching the interacting many-body non-reciprocal phase with volume law entanglement of quantum trajectories. Upon increasing the interaction above a critical value, we find a dissipative phase transition where reciprocity is dynamically restored.

Title: Metasurface-mediated quantum entanglement via bound states in the continuum

Abstract: Scalable quantum technologies demand entanglement between many distant quantum emitters (QEs), for which we propose using high-$Q$, spatially extended bound states in the continuum (BICs) in all-dielectric metasurfaces. We show that QE-BIC coupling efficiencies ($\beta$-factors) can exceed $80\%$, comparable to waveguides even without further mode engineering, but within a 2D geometry that naturally accommodates large QE arrays and relaxes strict emitter placement. Inter-QE entanglement is generated faster than in free space, is significantly amplified, and persists over several resonant wavelengths. Optimality requires large $\beta$-factors but moderately small Purcell factors. Our results establish all-dielectric metasurfaces as a practical, scalable platform for leading-edge quantum photonics.

Title: Energy transfer between localized emitters in photonic cavities from first principles
Authors: Swarnabha Chattaraj, Giulia Galli
Abstract: Radiative and nonradiative resonant couplings between defects are ubiquitous phenomena in photonic devices used in classical and quantum information technology applications. In this work we present a first principles approach to enable quantitative predictions of the energy transfer between defects in photonic cavities, beyond the dipole-dipole approximation and including the many-body nature of the electronic states. As an example, we discuss the energy transfer from a dipole like emitter to an F center in MgO in a spherical cavity. We show that the cavity can be used to controllably enhance or suppress specific spin flip and spin conserving transitions. Specifically, we predict that a ~10 to 100 enhancement in the non-radiative resonant energy transfer rate can be gained in the case of the F center in MgO by a rather moderate cavity with Q~400, and equal suppression in the rate can be achieved by incorporating a significant energy mismatch between the electronic excitation and the cavity mode. Our framework is general and readily applicable to a wide range of devices where localized emitters are embedded in micro-spheres, core-shell nanoparticles, and dielectric Mie resonators. Hence, our approach paves the way to predict how to control energy transfer in quantum memories and in ultra-high density optical memories, and in a variety of quantum information platforms.

Title: Vortical currents and reciprocal relations for transport coefficients in the electron hydrodynamic regime
Authors: Nisarg Chadha, Subroto Mukerjee
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic regime in metals with momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering. The conservation of momentum results in well-defined dynamics whose effects we investigate via the relevant continuity equations. We find anomalous contributions to the charge and heat transport currents arising from gradients of the velocity field in a semiclassical treatment with a Berry curvature. These contributions are non-vanishing for systems lacking inversion symmetry, and the corresponding transport coefficients do not obey the standard Onsager reciprocity relations. Instead, we show that the response coefficients relating the currents to the stress tensor obey independent reciprocity relations with the stress tensor and thus exhibit cross-tensor effects of charge and heat transport with the momentum transport. The Berry curvature contribution to the stress magnetization tensor is also derived.

Title: Fractional-statistics-induced entanglement from Andreev-like tunneling
Authors: Gu Zhang, Pierre Glidic, Frederic Pierre, Igor Gornyi, Yuval Gefen
Abstract: The role of anyonic statistics stands as a cornerstone in the landscape of topological quantum techniques. While recent years have brought forth encouraging and persuasive strides in detecting anyons, a significant facet remains unexplored, especially in view of connecting anyonic physics to quantum information platforms -- whether and how entanglement can be generated by anyonic braiding. Here, we demonstrate that even when two anyonic subsystems (represented by anyonic beams) are connected only by electron tunneling, entanglement between them, manifesting fractional statistics, is generated. To demonstrate this physics, we rely on a platform where fractional quantum Hall edges are bridged by a quantum point contact that allows only transmission of fermions (so-called Andreev-like tunneling). This invokes the physics of two-beam collisions in an anyonic Hong-Ou-Mandel collider, accompanied by a process that we dub anyon-quasihole braiding. We define an entanglement pointer -- a current-noise-based function tailored to quantify entanglement associated with quasiparticle fractional statistics. Our work, which exposes, both in theory and in experiment, entanglement associated with anyonic statistics and braiding, prospectively paves the way to the exploration of entanglement induced by non-Abelian statistics.

Title: Geometric and conventional contributions of superconducting diode effect: Application to flat-band systems
Authors: Jin-Xin Hu, Shuai A. Chen, K. T. Law
Abstract: Nonreciprocal critical supercurrents give rise to the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in noncentrosymmetric superconductors when time-reversal symmetry is broken. In this paper, we investigate the SDE in superconductors with vanishing spin-orbit coupling but featuring narrow bands near the Fermi energy -- a characteristic particularly relevant to moiré heterostructures, such as twisted bilayer graphene. Using phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory and self-consistent mean-field approaches, we analyze the contributions to the SDE from both conventional band dispersion and quantum geometry. While the conventional SDE arises from the asymmetric Fermi surface, we demonstrate that the quantum metric dipole generates a band quantum-geometric contribution to the SDE, even in systems with symmetric single-particle dispersion. Notably, in the flat-band limit, where the attractive interaction strength significantly exceeds the bandwidth, the contributions from quantum geometry to the supercurrent and diode effect become dominant. Our paper elucidates the conventional and quantum-geometric origins of superconducting nonreciprocity and explores their implications for flat-band superconductors.

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a brittle ceramic with a layered structure, however, recent experiments have suggested that inter-layer structural engineering could be key to new structural and functional properties. Here we report the scalable bulk synthesis of high-density crystalline h-BN solids, by using high-temperature spark plasma sintering (SPS) of h-BN powders, which show high values of mechanical strength, ductility, dielectric constant, thermal conductivity, and exceptional neutron radiation shielding capability. Through exhaustive characterizations we reveal that SPS induces non-basal plane crystallinity, twisting of layers, and facilitates inter-grain fusion with a high degree of in-plane alignment across macroscale dimensions, resulting in near-theoretical density and improved properties. Our findings highlight the importance of material design, via new approaches such as layer twisting and interlayer interconnections, to create novel ceramics with properties that could go beyond their intrinsic limits.

Title: Dynamical patterns and nonreciprocal effective interactions in an active-passive mixture through exact hydrodynamic analysis
Authors: James Mason, Robert L. Jack, Maria Bruna
Abstract: The formation of dynamical patterns is one of the most striking features of nonequilibrium physical systems. Recent work has shown that such patterns arise generically from forces that violate Newton's third law, known as nonreciprocal interactions. These nonequilibrium phenomena are challenging for modern theories. Here, we introduce a model mixture of active (self-propelled) and passive (diffusive) particles amenable to exact mathematical analysis. We exploit state-of-the-art methods to derive exact hydrodynamic equations for the particle densities, which reveal effective nonreciprocal couplings between the active and passive species. We study the resulting collective behavior, including the linear stability of homogeneous states and phase coexistence in large systems. This reveals a novel phase diagram with the spinodal associated with active phase separation protruding through the associated binodal, heralding the emergence of dynamical steady states. We analyze these states in the thermodynamic limit of large system size, showing, for example, that sharp interfaces may travel at finite velocities, but traveling phase-separated states are forbidden. The model's mathematical tractability enables precise new conclusions beyond those available by numerical simulation of particle models or field theories.

Title: Mechanistic rules for de novo design of enzymes
Authors: Michalis Chatzittofi, Jaime Agudo-Canalejo, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: Enzymes are nano-scale machines that have evolved to drive chemical reactions out of equilibrium in the right place at the right time. Given the complexity and specificity of enzymatic function, bottom-up design of enzymes presents a daunting task that is far more challenging than making passive molecules with specific binding affinities or building nano-scale mechanically active devices. We present a thermodynamically-consistent model for the operation of such a fuelled enzyme, which uses the energy from a favourable reaction to undergo non-equilibrium conformational changes that in turn catalyze a chemical reaction on an attached substrate molecule. We show that enzymatic function can emerge through a bifurcation upon appropriate implementation of momentum conservation on the effective reaction coordinates of the low dimensional description of the enzyme, and thanks to a generically present dissipative coupling. Our results can complement the recently developed strategies for de novo enzyme design based on machine learning approaches.

Title: Bilinear Sequence Regression: A Model for Learning from Long Sequences of High-dimensional Tokens
Authors: Vittorio Erba, Emanuele Troiani, Luca Biggio, Antoine Maillard, Lenka Zdeborová
Abstract: Current progress in artificial intelligence is centered around so-called large language models that consist of neural networks processing long sequences of high-dimensional vectors called tokens. Statistical physics provides powerful tools to study the functioning of learning with neural networks and has played a recognized role in the development of modern machine learning. The statistical physics approach relies on simplified and analytically tractable models of data. However, simple tractable models for long sequences of high-dimensional tokens are largely underexplored. Inspired by the crucial role models such as the single-layer teacher-student perceptron (aka generalized linear regression) played in the theory of fully connected neural networks, in this paper, we introduce and study the bilinear sequence regression (BSR) as one of the most basic models for sequences of tokens. We note that modern architectures naturally subsume the BSR model due to the skip connections. Building on recent methodological progress, we compute the Bayes-optimal generalization error for the model in the limit of long sequences of high-dimensional tokens, and provide a message-passing algorithm that matches this performance. We quantify the improvement that optimal learning brings with respect to vectorizing the sequence of tokens and learning via simple linear regression. We also unveil surprising properties of the gradient descent algorithms in the BSR model.

Title: Disorder-Order Interface Propagating over the Ferromagnetic Ground State in the Transverse Field Ising Chain
Authors: Vanja Marić, Florent Ferro, Maurizio Fagotti
Abstract: We consider time evolution of order parameters and entanglement asymmetries in the ferromagnetic phase of the transverse-field Ising chain. One side of the system is prepared in a ferromagnetic ground state and the other side either in equilibrium at higher temperature or out of equilibrium. We focus on the disorder-order interface in which the order parameter attains a nonzero value, different from the ground state one. In that region, correlations follow a universal behaviour. We analytically compute the asymptotic scaling functions of the one- and two-point equal time correlations of the order parameter and provide numerical evidence that also the non-equal time correlations are universal. We analyze the Rényi entanglement asymmetries of subsystems and obtain a prediction that is expected to hold also in the von Neumann limit. Finally, we show that the Wigner-Yanase skew information of the order paramerter in subsystems within the interfacial region scales as their length squared. We propose a semiclassical approximation that is particularly effective close to the edge of the lightcone.

Title: Fractionalized Superconductivity Mediated by Majorana Fermions in the Kitaev-Kondo Lattice
Authors: Matthew Bunney, Urban F. P. Seifert, Stephan Rachel, Matthias Vojta
Abstract: Superconductivity usually emerges from a metallic normal state which follows the Fermi-liquid paradigm. If, in contrast, the normal state is a fractionalized non-Fermi liquid, then pairing may either eliminate fractionalization via a Higgs-type mechanism leading to a conventional superconducting state, or pairing can occur in the presence of fractionalization. Here we discuss a simple model for the latter case: Using a combination of perturbation theory and functional renormalization group, we show that the Kitaev--Kondo lattice model displays a fractionalized superconducting phase at weak Kondo coupling. This phase is characterized by Cooper pairing of conventional electronic quasiparticles, coexisting with a spin-liquid background and topological order. Depending on the sign of the Kitaev coupling, we find the pairing to be either of chiral $d$-wave or $p$-wave type for extended doping regions around the van-Hove filling. We discuss applications and extensions.

Title: Higher-order Topological Knots and the classification of non-Hermitian lattices under $C_n$ symmetry
Authors: Yifan Wang, Wladimir A. Benalcazar
Abstract: In two dimensions, Hermitian lattices with non-zero Chern numbers and non-Hermitian lattices with a higher-order skin effect (HOSE) bypass the constraints of the Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem at their one-dimensional boundaries. This allows the realization of topologically-protected one-dimensional edges with nonreciprocal dynamics. However, unlike the edge states of Chern insulators, the nonreciprocal edges of HOSE phases exist only at certain edges of the two-dimensional lattice, not all, leading to corner-localized states. In this paper, we investigate the topological connections between these two systems and uncover novel non-Hermitian topological phases possessing higher-order topological knots (HOTKs). These phases arise from multiband topology protected by crystalline symmetries and host nonreciprocal edge states that circulate the entire boundary of the two-dimensional lattice. We show that phase transitions typically separate HOTK phases from complex Chern insulator phases - non-Hermitian lattices with nonzero Chern numbers protected by imaginary line gaps in the presence of time-reversal symmetry.

Title: Glassy dynamics near the interpolation transition in deep recurrent networks
Authors: John Hertz, Joanna Tyrcha
Abstract: We examine learning dynamics in deep recurrent networks, focusing on the behavior near the boundary in the depth-width plane separating under- from overparametrized networks, known as the interpolation transition. The training data are Bach chorales in 4-part harmony, and the learning is by stochastic gradient descent with a cross-entropy loss function. We find critical slowing down of the learning approaching the transition from the overparametrized side: For a given network depth, learning times to reach small training loss values appear to diverge proportional to 1/(w - w_c) as the width w approaches a (loss-dependent) critical value w_c. We identify the zero-loss limit of this value with the interpolation transition. We also study aging (the slowing down of fluctuations as the time since the beginning of learning increases). Taking a system that has been learning for a time tau_w, we measure the subsequent mean-square fluctuations of the weight values at times tau > tau_w. In the underparametrized phase, we find that they are well-described by a single function of tau/tau_w. While this scaling holds approximately at short times at the transition and in the overparametrized phase, it breaks down at longer times when the training loss gets close to the lower limit imposed by the stochastic gradient descent dynamics. Both this kind of aging and the critical slowing down are also found in certain spin glass models, suggesting that those models contain the most essential features of the learning dynamics.

Title: Impact of Fixing Spins in a Quantum Annealer with Energy Rescaling
Authors: Tomohiro Hattori, Hirotaka Irie, Tadashi Kadowaki, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, various hardware restrictions significantly impede its efficient performance. Size-reduction methods provide an effective approach for addressing large-scale problems but often introduce additional challenges. A notable hardware restriction is the limited number of decision variables quantum annealing can handle compared to the size of the problem. Moreover, when employing size-reduction methods, the interactions and local magnetic fields in the Ising model--used to represent the combinatorial optimization problem--can become excessively large, making them difficult to implement on hardware. Although prior studies suggest that energy rescaling impacts the performance of quantum annealing, its interplay with size-reduction methods remains unexplored. This study examines the relationship between fixing spins, a promising size-reduction method, and the effects of energy rescaling. Numerical simulations and experiments conducted on a quantum annealer demonstrate that the fixing spins method enhances quantum annealing performance while preserving the spin-chain embedding for a homogeneous, fully connected ferromagnetic Ising model.

Title: Quantum anomalous Hall domains in a Quenched Topological Mott Insulator
Authors: Lara Ulčakar, Gal Lemut, Tomaž Rejec, Jernej Mravlje
Abstract: We study an interacting spinless quadratic band touching model that realizes a topological Mott insulating state. We quench the interaction from a value corresponding to the nematic insulator to that of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) ordered phase. We perform time-dependent Hartree-Fock simulations and show that after the quench the system realizes an excited Dirac semimetal state, which is however unstable and spontaneously evolves to a state with inhomogeneous nematic and QAH order parameters. The modulations form a stripe pattern that grows exponentially with time until the local Chern marker reaches unity. The alternating QAH order defines a domain structure with boundaries that host chiral sublattice currents.

Title: Ultrafast dynamics of moments in bulk ferromagnets
Authors: Mouad Fattouhi, Pascal Thibaudeau, Liliana D. Buda-Prejbeanu
Abstract: A robust and efficient model for investigating the ultrafast dynamics of magnetic materials excited by laser pulses has been created, integrating dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equations with a quantum thermostat and a two-temperature model. The model has been successfully applied to three archetypal materials in the literature: nickel, cobalt, and iron. Additionally, analysis of the ultrafast dynamic susceptibility tensor indicates that off-diagonal components display specific features depending on whether a continuous external magnetic field is present.

Title: Uncovering the atomic structure of substitutional platinum dopants in MoS$_2$ with single-sideband ptychography
Authors: David Lamprecht, Anna Benzer, Manuel Längle, Mate Capin, Clemens Mangler, Toma Susi, Lado Filipovic, Jani Kotakoski
Abstract: We substitute individual Pt atoms into monolayer MoS$_2$ and study the resulting atomic structures with single-sideband (SSB) ptychography supported by ab initio simulations. We demonstrate that while high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging provides excellent Z-contrast, distinguishing some defect types such as single and double sulfur vacancies remains challenging due to their low relative contrast difference. However, SSB with its nearly linear Z-contrast and high phase sensitivity enables reliable identification of these defect configurations as well as various Pt dopant structures at significantly lower electron doses. Our findings uncover the precise atomic placement and highlight the potential of SSB ptychography for detailed structural analysis of dopant-modified 2D materials while minimizing beam-induced damage, offering new pathways for understanding and engineering atomic-scale features in 2D systems.

Title: Yin-Yang vortex on UTe2 (011) surface

Abstract: UTe2 is a promising candidate for spin-triplet superconductor, yet its exact superconducting order parameter remains highly debated. Here, via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observe a novel type of magnetic vortex with distinct dark-bright contrast in local density of states on UTe2 (011) surface under a perpendicular magnetic field, resembling the conjugate structure of Yin-Yang diagram in Taoism. Each Yin-Yang vortex contains a quantized magnetic flux, and the boundary between the Yin and Yang parts aligns with the crystallographic a-axis of UTe2. The vortex states exhibit intriguing behaviors -- a sharp zero-energy conductance peak exists at the Yang part, while a superconducting gap with pronounced coherence peaks exists at the Yin part, which is even sharper than those measured far from the vortex core or in the absence of magnetic field. By theoretical modeling, we show that the Yin-Yang vortices on UTe2 (011) surface can be explained by the asymmetric vortex-derived local distortion of the zero-energy surface states associated with spin-triplet pairing with appropriate d-vectors. Therefore, the observation of Yin-Yang vortex confirms the spin-triplet pairing in UTe2 and imposes constraints on the candidate d-vector for the spin-triplet pairing.

Title: Quantum Borderlines - Fluctuation Energies in Ultracold Bose Gases
Authors: Carsten Henkel
Abstract: Ultracold Bose gases are many-body systems with well-defined particle interactions that may serve as models for interacting quantum fields. The impact of virtual excitations is studied in the spatial transition zone created by a soft confinement potential that separates a degenerate ideal gas from a dense quasi-condensate. We compute within Bogoliubov theory the contribution of quasi-particles to the surface energy at zero temperature.

Title: Two-Dimensional Ferroelectric Altermagnets: From Model to Material Realization
Authors: Ziye Zhu, Xunkai Duan, Jiayong Zhang, Bowen Hao, Igor Zutic, Tong Zhou
Abstract: Multiferroic altermagnets offer new opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling and electrically tunable spintronics. However, due to intrinsic symmetry conflicts between altermagnetism and ferroelectricity, achieving their coexistence, known as ferroelectric altermagnets (FEAM), remains an outstanding challenge, especially in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here, we propose a universal, symmetry-based design principle for 2D FEAM, supported by tight-binding models and first-principles calculations. We show that lattice distortions can break spin equivalence and introduce the necessary rotation-related symmetry, enabling altermagnetism with electrically reversible spin splitting. Guided by this framework, we identify a family of 2D vanadium oxyhalides and sulfide halides as promising FEAM candidates. In these compounds, pseudo Jahn-Teller distortions and Peierls-like dimerization cooperatively establish the required symmetry conditions. We further propose the magneto-optical Kerr effect as an experimental probe to confirm FEAM and its electric spin reversal. Our findings provide a practical framework for 2D FEAM and advancing electrically controlled spintronic devices.

Title: Anomalous interference drives oscillatory dynamics in wave-dressed active particles
Authors: Austin M. Blitstein, Rodolfo R. Rosales, Pedro J. Sáenz
Abstract: A recent surge of discoveries has sparked significant interest in active systems where a particle moves autonomously in resonance with its self-generated wave field, leading to notable wave-mediated effects including new propulsion mechanisms, spontaneous oscillatory dynamics, and quantum-like phenomena. Drawing from an archetypical model of wave-dressed active particles, we unveil a wave-mediated non-local force driving their dynamics, arising from the particle's path memory and an unconventional form of wave interference near jerking points, locations where the particle's velocity changes rapidly. In contrast to the typical case of constructive interference at points of stationary phase, waves excited by the particle near jerking points avoid cancellation through rapid changes in frequency. Through an asymptotic analysis, we derive the wave force from jerking points, revealing it as an elusive but crucial remnant of the particle's past motion that underlies a range of phenomena previously regarded as disparate -- including in-line speed oscillations, wave-like statistics in potential wells, and non-specular reflections -- and places them within a unified mechanistic framework resulting from generic wave superposition principles.

Title: Physical ageing from generalised time-translation-invariance
Authors: Malte Henkel
Abstract: A generalised form of time-translation-invariance permits to re-derive the known generic phenomenology of ageing, which arises in classical many-body systems after a quench from an initially disordered system to a temperature $T\leq T_c$, at or below the critical temperature $T_c$. Generalised time-translation-invariance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of representation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries of scale-invariance and time-translation-invariance. Observable consequences include the algebraic form of the scaling functions for large arguments of the two-time auto-correlators and auto-responses, the equality of the auto-correlation and the auto-response exponents $\lambda_C=\lambda_R$, the cross-over scaling form for an initially magnetised critical system and the explanation of a novel finite-size scaling if the auto-correlator or auto-response converge for large arguments $y=t/s\gg 1$ to a plateau. For global two-time correlators, the time-dependence involving the initial critical slip exponent $\Theta$ is confirmed and is generalised to all temperatures below criticality and to the global two-time response function, and their finite-size scaling is derived as well. This also includes the time-dependence of the squared global order-parameter. The celebrate Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation with the auto-correlation exponent is thereby extended to all temperatures below the critical temperature. A simple criterion on the relevance of non-linear terms in the stochastic equation of motion is derived, taking the dimensionality of couplings into account. Its applicability in a wide class of models is confirmed, for temperatures $T\leq T_c$. Relevance to experiments is also discussed.

Title: Geometric potential for a Bose-Einstein condensate on a curved surface
Authors: Sheilla M. de Oliveira, Natália Salomé Móller
Abstract: We compute the ground state of a Bose-Einstein condensate confined on a curved surface and unravel the effects of curvatures. Starting with a general formulation for any smooth surface, we apply it to a prolate ellipsoid, which is inspired by recent bubble trap experiments. Using only elementary tools, we perform a perturbative approach to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and a general Ansatz, followed by a dimensional reduction. We derive an effective two-dimensional equation that includes a curvature-dependent geometric potential. We compute the ground state using Thomas-Fermi approximation and, for an isotropic confinement, we find that the highest accumulation of atoms happens on the regions with the greatest difference between the principal curvatures. For a prolate ellipsoid, this accumulation happens on the equator, which is contrary to previous findings that describe accumulation on the poles of a bubble trap. Finally, we explain the reasons for this difference: the higher accumulation of atoms on the poles happens due to anisotropies in the confinement, while the higher accumulation on the equator happens exclusively due to the geometric properties of the surface.

Title: Optimizing proximitized magnetic topological insulator nanoribbons for Majorana bound states
Authors: Eduárd Zsurka, Daniele Di Miceli, Julian Legendre, Llorenç Serra, Detlev Grützmacher, Thomas L. Schmidt, Kristof Moors
Abstract: Heterostructures comprised of a magnetic topological insulator (MTI) placed in the proximity of an $s$-wave superconductor have emerged as a platform for the practical realization of Majorana bound states (MBSs). More specifically, it has been theoretically predicted that MBS can appear in proximitized MTI nanoribbons (PNRs) in the quantum anomalous Hall regime. As with all MBS platforms, disorder and device imperfections can be detrimental to the formation of robust and well-separated MBSs that are suitable for fusion and braiding experiments. Here, we identify the optimal conditions for obtaining a topological superconducting gap that is robust against disorder, with spatially separated stable MBSs in PNRs, and introduce a figure of merit that encompasses these conditions. Particular attention is given to the thin-film limit of magnetic topological insulators (MTIs), where the hybridization of the surface states cannot be neglected, and to the role of electron-hole asymmetry in the low-energy physics of the system. Based on our numerical results, we find that (1) MTI thin films that are normal (rather than quantum spin Hall) insulators for zero magnetization are favorable, (2) strong electron-hole asymmetry causes the stability and robustness of MBS to be very different for chemical potentials above or below the Dirac point, and (3) the magnetization strength should preferably be comparable to the hybridization or confinement energy of the surface states, whichever is largest.

Title: Generalized Non-Hermitian Skin Effect
Authors: Zheng Wei, Ji-Yao Fan, Kui Cao, Xin-Ran Ma, Su-Peng Kou
Abstract: In this Letter, we present a unified theory termed the generalized non-Hermitian skin effect. This framework provides a universal characterization of typical one-dimensional non-Hermitian skin effects within the perturbative regime and unveils a novel type of skin effect that beyond the predictions of the generalized Brillouin zone theory, referred to as the relative skin effect. Previously recognized skin effects are classified as global skin effects, thereby explicitly delineating the scope and limitations of existing non-Bloch band theories. Additionally, we establish, for the first time, a phase transition criterion between global skin effects and relative skin effect, demonstrating the competition between these two distinct types of skin effects, emphasizing the pivotal role of real-space non-Hermitian terms in understanding skin effects and challenging the traditional reliance of non-Bloch band theory on momentum space. Our study substantially advances the conceptual framework of non-Hermitian physics and provides new theoretical tools for investigation.

Title: Soft superconductivity in covalent bismuth dihydride BiH$_2$ under extreme conditions

Abstract: Strong magnetic fields provide a unique environment for investigating the fundamental properties of superconducting materials, especially for hydride superconductors with large upper critical fields. Following this idea, we have investigated the effect of pulsed magnetic fields on covalent bismuth dihydride (BiH$_2$), successfully synthesized under pressure up to 211 GPa. The electrical resistance measurements indicate that the superconducting phase $P2_1/m$-BiH$_2$ exhibits the highest superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) of 70 K among MH$_2$-type hydrides apart from H$_2$this http URL electrical transport experiments under both pulsed (up to 50 T) and steady magnetic fields (up to 16 T) for $P2_1/m$- and $C2/m$-BiH$_2$ indicate that the upper critical fields $\mu_0 H_{c2}(0)$ = 12--16 T are unusually low, much lower than that of clathrate-like metal polyhydrides with similar $T_c$. This is due to the unexpectedly high Fermi velocity in BiH$_2$, about $1.1 \times 10^6$ m/s, which allows to classify BiH$_2$ as a 'soft' molecular superconducting hydride with relatively weak vortex this http URL of the current-voltage characteristics in the pulsed mode make it possible to experimentally establish the temperature dependence of the critical current density (the maximum $J_c(0) = 10$ kA/mm$^2$), which indicates the presence of two $s$-wave superconducting gaps in BiH$_2$ at 172--176 GPa: $\Delta_L(0) = 6.9 \pm 1.2$ meV and $\Delta_S(0) \sim 1.5$ meV.

Title: Landau Instability and soliton formation
Authors: Shanquan Lan, Hong Liu, Yu Tian, Hongbao Zhang
Abstract: Consider at a finite temperature $T$ a superfluid moving with a velocity $v$ relative to the thermal bath or its normal component. From Landau's argument there exists a critical $v_c (T)$ beyond which excitations can be spontaneously generated and the system becomes unstable. Identifying the final state induced by such an instability has been an outstanding open question. Using holographic duality we perform dynamical simulations of evolutions from initial unstable states, and find that the system settles to a homogenous superfluid state with a final velocity below the critical velocity. The dynamical evolution process appears to be highly chaotic, exhibiting transient turbulence. Nevertheless we are able to identify from the simulations a universal physical mechanism for the reduction of superfluid velocity, in terms of spontaneous nucleation of solitons. We also derive a simple analytic formula which relates the final velocity to the number of solitons nucleated during the evolution.

Title: Potts and random cluster measures on locally regular-tree-like graphs
Authors: Anirban Basak, Amir Dembo, Allan Sly
Abstract: Fixing $\beta \ge 0$ and an integer $q \ge 2$, consider the ferromagnetic $q$-Potts measures $\mu_n^{\beta,B}$ on finite graphs ${\sf G}_n$ on $n$ vertices, with external field strength $B \ge 0$ and the corresponding random cluster measures $\varphi^{q,\beta,B}_{n}$. Suppose that as $n \to \infty$ the uniformly sparse graphs ${\sf G}_n$ converge locally to an infinite $d$-regular tree ${\sf T}_{d}$, $d \ge 3$. We show that the convergence of the Potts free energy density to its Bethe replica symmetric prediction (which has been proved in case $d$ is even, or when $B=0$), yields the local weak convergence of $\varphi^{q,\beta,B}_n$ and $\mu_n^{\beta,B}$ to the corresponding free or wired random cluster measure, Potts measure, respectively, on ${\sf T}_{d}$. The choice of free versus wired limit is according to which has the larger Potts Bethe functional value, with mixtures of these two appearing {as limit points on} the critical line $\beta_c(q,B)$ where these two values of the Bethe functional coincide. For $B=0$ and $\beta>\beta_c$, we further establish a pure-state decomposition by showing that conditionally on the same dominant color $1 \le k \le q$, the $q$-Potts measures on such edge-expander graphs ${\sf G}_n$ converge locally to the $q$-Potts measure on ${\sf T}_{d}$ with a boundary wired at color $k$.

Title: A Dark Matter Fermionic Quantum Fluid from Standard Model Dynamics
Authors: Stephon Alexander, Heliudson Bernardo, Humberto Gilmer
Abstract: We present a model of dark matter as a superconducting fluid of Cooper pairs of right handed neutrinos or of vector-like quarks. The superconducting dark matter is induced by attractive channels in the Standard Model Higgs and color sectors of the Standard Model, respectively. We show that, for each case, the solution to the gap equation provides viable dark matter candidates for suitable chemical potential values. The mechanism yields an ultra-light neutrino condensate with a mass of $m_{\rm DM} \sim 10^{-19} \text{eV}$ or a vector-like quark condensate with wide range of possible masses. Both cosmological and particle physics constraints on the model lead to a connection between the number of effective relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, and the chemical potential and CMB temperature at the time of fermion creation. We also find a relation between the superconducting fermion and baryon densities, with implications for the coincidence between the dark matter and baryon densities in standard cosmology. Given the natural $\text{eV}$ scale of neutrinos, this mechanism may have implications for the Hubble tension.

Title: Quantum complexity and localization in random and time-periodic unitary circuits
Authors: Himanshu Sahu, Aranya Bhattacharya, Pingal Pratyush Nath
Abstract: We study the growth and saturation of Krylov spread (K-) complexity under random quantum circuits. In Haar-random unitary evolution, we show that, for large system sizes, K-complexity grows linearly before saturating at a late-time value of $D/2$, where $D$ is the Hilbert space dimension, at timescales $\sim D$. Our numerical analysis encompasses two classes of random circuits: brick-wall random unitary circuits and Floquet random circuits. In brick-wall case, K-complexity exhibits dynamics consistent with Haar-random unitary evolution, while the inclusion of measurements significantly slows its growth down. For Floquet random circuits, we show that localized phases lead to reduced late-time saturation values of K-complexity, forbye we utilize these saturation values to probe the transition between thermal and many-body localized phases.

Title: Neural Entropy
Authors: Akhil Premkumar
Abstract: We explore the connection between deep learning and information theory through the paradigm of diffusion models. A diffusion model converts noise into structured data by reinstating, imperfectly, information that is erased when data was diffused to noise. This information is stored in a neural network during training. We quantify this information by introducing a measure called neural entropy, which is related to the total entropy produced by diffusion. Neural entropy is a function of not just the data distribution, but also the diffusive process itself. Measurements of neural entropy on a few simple image diffusion models reveal that they are extremely efficient at compressing large ensembles of structured data.

Title: Connectivity matters: Impact of bath modes ordering and geometry in open quantum system simulation with Tensor Network States
Authors: Thibaut Lacroix, Brendon W. Lovett, Alex W. Chin
Abstract: Being able to study the dynamics of quantum systems interacting with several environments is important in many settings ranging from quantum chemistry to quantum thermodynamics, through out-of-equilibrium systems. For such problems tensor network-based methods are state-of-the-art approaches for performing numerically exact simulations. However, to be used efficiently in this multi-environment and non-perturbative context, these methods require an optimized choice of the topology of the wave-function Ansätze. This is often done by analysing cross-correlations between different system and environment degrees of freedom. Here, we show for canonical model Hamiltonians that simple orderings of bosonic environmental modes, which enable the joint {System + Environments} state to be written as a matrix product state, considerably reduce the bond dimension required for convergence despite introducing long-ranged interactions. These results suggest that complex correlation analyses for tweaking tensor networks topology (e.g. entanglement renormalization) are usually not necessary and that tree tensor network states are sub-optimal compared to simple matrix product states in many important models of physical open systems.

Title: Nonlinear semiclassical spectroscopy of ultrafast molecular polariton dynamics
Authors: Michael Reitz, Arghadip Koner, Joel Yuen-Zhou
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways, which can be used to isolate purely bright state contributions. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to model a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.

Abstract: We present a protocol to implement a spin-1 chain in Rydberg systems using three Rydberg states close to a Förster resonance. In addition to dipole-dipole interactions, strong van der Waals interactions naturally appear due to the presence of the Förster resonance and give rise to a highly tunable Hamiltonian. The resulting phase diagram is studied using the infinite density-matrix renormalization group and reveals a highly robust Haldane phase -- a prime example of a symmetry protected topological phase. We find experimentally accessible parameters to probe the Haldane phase in current Rydberg systems, and demonstrate an efficient adiabatic preparation scheme. This paves the way to probe the remarkable properties of spin fractionalization in the Haldane phase.

Title: Quantum simulation of the microscopic to macroscopic crossover using superconducting quantum impurities
Authors: Amir Burshtein, Moshe Goldstein
Abstract: Despite being a pillar of quantum mechanics, little attention has been paid to the onset of Fermi's golden rule as a discrete microscopic bath of modes approaches the macroscopic thermodynamic limit and forms a continuum. Motivated by recent experiments in circuit quantum electrodynamics, we tackle this question through the lens of single-photon decay in a finite transmission line coupled to a qubit ("quantum impurity"). We consider a single-photon state, coupled via the nonlinear impurity to several baths formed by multi-photon states with different number of photons, which are inherently discrete due to the finite size of the line. We focus on the late-time dynamics of the single-photon, and uncover the conditions under which the photon's decoherence rate approaches the decay rate predicted by Fermi's golden rule. We show that it is necessary to keep a small but finite escape rate (unrelated to the impurity) for each single-photon mode to obtain a finite long-time decay rate. We analyze the contribution of the baths formed by many-body states with different number of photons, and illustrate how the decay rate induced by some bath of $n$ photon states is enhanced by the presence of other baths of $m \neq n$ photon states, highlighting the contribution of cascade photon decay processes. Our formalism could be used to analyze recent experiments in superconducting circuits.

Title: Synchronous manipulation of nuclear spins via boron vacancy centers in hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Fattah Sakuldee, Mehdi Abdi
Abstract: We develop a method for entangling operations on nuclear spins surrounding a negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-center) point defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). To this end, we propose to employ the electron spin of a VB-center as a control qubit. We show that in the presence of a background magnetic field and by applying control pulses, one can collectively manipulate the state of the nuclei with $\hat{U}_z$ and $\hat{U}_x$ rotations. These rotations can serve for implementing the synchronous three-qubit $X$, $Z$, and the Hadamard gates. Through our numerical analyses considering realistic system parameters and the decoherence effects, we demonstrate that these gates can be executed with high fidelities. Furthermore, as an example for the application of our toolbox, we utilize these collective gates to prepare the highly entangled GHZ states among the three nuclear spins with a fidelity of $0.99$. By including the electron decoherence effects, we find that the relative deviations of the gate fidelities from the noisy terms are negligibly small, proving the noise-resilience of our protocols. Our work can serve as the foundation for exploiting the nuclear spins in hBN in future quantum technological applications.

Title: Roughening dynamics of interfaces in the two-dimensional quantum Ising model
Authors: Wladislaw Krinitsin, Niklas Tausendpfund, Matteo Rizzi, Markus Heyl, Markus Schmitt
Abstract: The properties of interfaces are key to understand the physics of matter. However, the study of quantum interface dynamics has remained an outstanding challenge. Here, we use large-scale Tree Tensor Network simulations to identify the dynamical signature of an interface roughening transition within the ferromagnetic phase of the 2D quantum Ising model. For initial domain wall profiles we find extended prethermal plateaus for smooth interfaces, whereas above the roughening transition the domain wall decays quickly. Our results can be readily explored experimentally in Rydberg atomic systems.

Title: Tunable anharmonicity in cavity optomechanics in the unresolved sideband regime
Authors: Jonathan L. Wise, Clement Dutreix, Fabio Pistolesi
Abstract: Introducing a controlled and strong anharmonicity in mechanical systems is a present challenge of nanomechanics. In cavity optomechanics a mechanical oscillator may be made anharmonic by ponderomotively coupling its motion to the light field of a laser-driven cavity. In the regime where the mechanical resonating frequency and the single-photon coupling constant are small compared to the decay rate of the cavity field, it turns out that the quantum electromagnetic fluctuations of the laser field drive the oscillator into a high-temperature thermal state. The motional state may however be highly non-Gaussian; we show that a precise tuning of system parameters may even lead to a purely quartic effective potential for the mechanical oscillator. We present a theory that predicts the measurable signatures left by the mechanical anharmonicity. In particular, we obtain analytically and numerically the mechanical displacement spectrum, and explore the imprints of the mechanical anharmonicity on the cavity light field.

Title: Co-Designing Eigen- and Singular-value Transformation Oracles: From Algorithmic Applications to Hardware Compilation
Authors: Luke Bell, Yan Wang, Kevin C. Smith, Yuan Liu, Eugene Dumitrescu, S. M. Girvin
Abstract: We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To showcase the oracle's representation-theoretic power, and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. In doing so, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancilla qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of eigenstate preparation in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation -- applicable in both near-term and large-scale quantum processors -- expressing high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system, and we provide details for 1D and 2D examples. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions.

Title: Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal
Authors: Samuel D. Tomlinson, Aliki M. Tsopelakou, Tzia M. Onn, Steven R. H. Barrett, Adam M. Boies, Shaun D. Fitzgerald
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, surface-based removal techniques, such as sorption, catalysis and filtration, are often limited by pollutant transport and removal rate constraints. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow through cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies are applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e annually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal potential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when sorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets, outperforming the \$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are applied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for these technologies' costs per square meter. However, our calculations indicate that optimising catalyst properties and surface coverage could lower the cost estimates to below \$100 per tCO$_2$e across these applications. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a scalable pathway to advance climate and health objectives.

Title: Dynamics in the presence of local symmetry-breaking impurities
Authors: Yahui Li, Pablo Sala, Frank Pollmann, Sanjay Moudgalya, Olexei Motrunich
Abstract: Continuous symmetries lead to universal slow relaxation of correlation functions in quantum many-body systems. In this work, we study how local symmetry-breaking impurities affect the dynamics of these correlation functions using Brownian quantum circuits, which we expect to apply to generic non-integrable systems with the same symmetries. While explicitly breaking the symmetry is generally expected to lead to eventual restoration of full ergodicity, we find that approximately conserved quantities that survive under such circumstances can still induce slow relaxation. This can be understood using a super-Hamiltonian formulation, where low-lying excitations determine the late-time dynamics and exact ground states correspond to conserved quantities. We show that in one dimension, symmetry-breaking impurities modify diffusive and subdiffusive behaviors associated with U$(1)$ and dipole conservation at late-times, e.g., by increasing power-law decay exponents of the decay of autocorrelation functions. This stems from the fact that for these symmetries, impurities are relevant in the renormalization group sense, e.g., bulk impurities effectively disconnect the system, completely modifying both temporal and spatial correlations. On the other hand, for an impurity that disrupts strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the super-Hamiltonian only acquires an exponentially small gap, leading to prethermal plateaus in autocorrelation functions which extend for times that scale exponentially with the distance to the impurity. Overall, our approach systematically characterizes how symmetry breaking impurities affect relaxation dynamics in symmetric systems.

Title: Integrability and Chaos via fractal analysis of Spectral Form Factors: Gaussian approximations and exact results
Authors: Lorenzo Campos Venuti, Jovan Odavić, Alioscia Hamma
Abstract: We establish the mathematical equivalence between the spectral form factor, a quantity used to identify the onset of quantum chaos and scrambling in quantum many-body systems, and the classical problem of statistical characterization of planar random walks. We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random process on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such random process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the associated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This leads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for quantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low temperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the distribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the spectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation. Assuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical problem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk, defined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement, approaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk approaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the fractal dimension $4/3$. Additionally, we numerically show that Bethe Ansatz walkers fall into a category similar to the non-integrable walkers.
