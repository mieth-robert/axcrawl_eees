Title: Exact generalized Bethe eigenstates of the non-integrable alternating Heisenberg chain
Authors: Ronald Melendrez, Bhaskar Mukherjee, Marcin Szyniszewski, Christopher J. Turner, Arijeet Pal, Hitesh J. Changlani
Abstract: Exact solutions of quantum lattice models serve as useful guides for interpreting physical phenomena in condensed matter systems. Prominent examples of integrability appear in one dimension, including the Heisenberg chain, where the Bethe ansatz method has been widely successful. Recent work has noted that certain non-integrable models harbor quantum many-body scar states, which form a superspin of regular states hidden in an otherwise chaotic spectrum. Here we consider one of the simplest examples of a non-integrable model, the alternating ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic (bond-staggered) Heisenberg chain, a close cousin of the spin-1 Haldane chain and a spin analog of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and show the presence of exponentially many zero-energy states. We highlight features of the alternating chain that allow treatment with the Bethe ansatz (with important modifications) and surprisingly for a non-integrable system, we find simple compact expressions for zero-energy eigenfunctions for a few magnons including solutions with fractionalized particle momentum. We discuss a general numerical recipe to diagnose the existence of such generalized Bethe ansatz (GBA) states and also provide exact analytic expressions for the entanglement of such states. We conclude by conjecturing a picture of magnon pairing which may generalize to multiple magnons. Our work opens the avenue to describe certain eigenstates of partially integrable systems using the GBA.

Title: Exact quantum many-body scars tunable from volume to area law
Authors: Bhaskar Mukherjee, Christopher J. Turner, Marcin Szyniszewski, Arijeet Pal
Abstract: Teleportation of quantum information over long distances requires robust entanglement on the macroscopic scale. The construction of a manifold of highly energetic eigenstates with tunable long-range entanglement can provide a new medium for information transmission. We construct polynomially many exact zero-energy eigenstates in an exponentially degenerate manifold for a class of non-integrable spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with two-body interactions. A symmetric superposition of the triplet basis of antipodal spin pairs provides a rich manifold for the construction of states with extensive, logarithmic, and short-range entanglement by tuning the distribution of triplet states. We show the volume-law entangled states despite being in the middle of the spectrum host non-thermal expectation values of local observables. Certain quasiparticle excitations in this manifold converge to be exact quantum many-body scars in the thermodynamic limit. This framework has a natural extension to higher dimensions, where entangled states controlled by lattice geometry and internal symmetries can result in new classes of correlated out-of-equilibrium quantum matter. Our results provide a new avenue for entanglement control and a novel method of quantum state construction.

Title: AtomProNet: Data flow to and from machine learning interatomic potentials in materials science
Authors: Musanna Galib, Mewael Isiet, Mauricio Ponga
Abstract: As the atomistic simulations of materials science move from traditional potentials to machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), the field is entering the second phase focused on discovering and explaining new material phenomena. While MLIP development relies on curated data and flexible datasets from ab-initio simulations, transitioning seamlessly between ab-initio workflows and MLIP frameworks remains challenging. A global survey was conducted to understand the current standing (progress and bottleneck) of the machine learning-guided materials science research. The survey responses have been implemented to design an open-source software to reduce the access barriers of MLIP models for the global scientific community. Here, we present AtomProNet, an open-source Python package that automates obtaining atomic structures, prepares and submits ab-initio jobs, and efficiently collects batch-processed data for streamlined neural network (NN) training. Finally, we compared empirical and start-of-the-art machine learning potential, showing the practicality of using MLIPs based on computational time and resources.

Title: Non-Topological Edge-Localized Yu-Shiba-Rusinov States in CrBr$_3$/NbSe$_2$ Heterostructures
Authors: Jan P. Cuperus, Daniel Vanmaekelbergh, Ingmar Swart
Abstract: Topological superconductivity is predicted to emerge in certain magnet-superconductor hybrid systems. Here, we revisit the heterostructure of insulating monolayer CrBr$_3$ and NbSe$_2$, for which different conclusions on the presence of topological superconductivity have been reported. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and (shot noise) spectroscopy, we find that the superconducting gap well inside the CrBr3 islands is not affected by magnetism. At the island edges, we observe Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states at a variety of in-gap positions, including zero energy. The absence of topological superconductivity is verified by extensive dI/dV measurements at the CrBr$_3$ island edges. Our results ask for a more detailed understanding of the interaction between magnetic insulators and superconductors.

Title: Effects of electron correlation on resonant Edelstein and inverse-Edelstein effects
Authors: Mojdeh Saleh, Abhishek Kumar, Dmitrii L. Maslov, Saurabh Maiti
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in systems with broken inversion symmetry gives rise to the Edelstein effect, which is the induced spin polarization in response to an applied electric field or current, and the inverse Edelstein effect, which is the induced electric current in response to an oscillatory magnetic field or spin polarization. At the same time, an interplay between spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interaction leads to a special type of collective excitations -- chiral-spin modes -- which are oscillations of spin polarization in the absence of a magnetic field. As a result, both Edelstein and inverse Edelstein effects exhibit resonances at the frequencies of spin-chiral collective modes. Here, we present a detailed study of the effect of electron correlation on the Edelstein and inverse Edelstein effects in a single-valley two-dimensional electron gas and a multi-valley Dirac system with proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. While the chiral-spin modes involve both in-plane and out-of-plane oscillations of spins, we show that only the in-plane modes are responsible for the above resonances. In the multi-valley system, electron correlation splits the in-plane modes into two. We also study the spectral weight distribution between the two resonances over a large parameter space of intra- and inter-valley interactions.

Title: Active bacterial baths in droplets
Authors: Cristian Villalobos-Concha, Zhengyang Liu, Gabriel Ramos, Martyna Goral, Anke Lindner, Teresa López-León, Eric Clément, Rodrigo Soto, María Luisa Cordero
Abstract: Suspensions of self-propelled objects represent a novel paradigm in colloidal science. In such active baths traditional concepts, such as Brownian motion, fluctuation-dissipation relations, and work extraction from heat reservoirs, must be extended beyond the conventional framework of thermal baths. Unlike thermal baths, which are characterized by a single parameter, the temperature, the fundamental descriptors of an active bath remain elusive, especially in confined environments. In this study, buoyant, passive tracers are employed as generalized probes to investigate an active bath comprising motile bacteria confined within a droplet. We demonstrate that momentum transfer from the bath to the tracer can be effectively described as colored noise, characterized by temporal memory and an enhanced effective diffusivity significantly larger compared to thermal Brownian motion values. Using a stochastic analytical framework, we extract the temporal memory and diffusivity parameters that define such an active bath. Notably, the diffusivity scales linearly with bacterial concentration, modulated by a factor representing the role of confinement, expressed as the ratio of the confining radius to the probe radius. This finding, while still awaiting a complete theoretical explanation, offers new insights into the transport properties of confined active baths and paves the way for a deeper understanding of active emulsions driven by confined active matter.

Title: An Approach to Use Depletion Charges for Modifying Band Profiles for Field-Effect Transistors
Authors: P. Xu, H. Luo
Abstract: We present the study of using depletion charges for tailoring lateral band profiles and applying it to the promising gate-all-around field-effect transistors (GAAFET). Specifically, we introduce heavily p-type doped Si next to the channel, but outside the channel, of a transistor. They are connected to the heavily n-type doped source and drain for generating the depletion charges. The finite difference method was used for simulations and the results show significant modifications of the conduction band along the channel. The depletion charges act as built-in electrodes capable of significantly modifying the band profiles of field-effect transistors. Quantum confinement within the channel has been attempted with different approaches, such as additional electrodes and point contacts. The results presented show two aspects of this approach, namely, realizing quantum confinement in an all-Si structure and tailoring band profiles within channels to modify their transport properties.

Title: Selective enhancement of Coulomb interactions in planar Weyl fermions
Authors: Vadym Apalkov, Wenchen Luo, Tapash Chakraborty
Abstract: We report on our study of the electron interaction effects in topological two-dimensional (2D) materials placed in a quantizing magnetic field. Taking our cue from a recent experimental report, we consider a particular case of bismuthene monolayer with a strong spin-orbit interaction which can be a Weyl semimetal when placed on a specially tuned substrate. Interestingly, we observe that in some Landau levels of this material, the interaction effects are strongly enhanced compared to those for a conventional 2D system. Such an enhancement of electron-electron interactions in these materials is largely due to an anisotropy present in the materials. Additionally, the interaction effects can be tuned by changing the coupling to the substrate and the strongest inter-electron interactions are observed when the system is a Weyl semimental. The observed enhancement of the interaction effects can therefore be an important signature of the 2D Weyl fermions.

Title: Time-reversal symmetry breaking, collective modes, and Raman spectrum in pair-density-wave states
Authors: Yi-Ming Wu, Andrey V. Chubukov, Yuxuan Wang, Steven A. Kivelson
Abstract: Inspired by empirical evidence of the existence of pair-density-wave (PDW) order in certain underdoped cuprates, we investigate the collective modes in systems with unidirectional PDW order with momenta $\pm {Q}$ and a $d$-wave form-factor with special focus on the amplitude (Higgs) modes. In the pure PDW state, there are two overdamped Higgs modes. We show that a phase with co-existing PDW and uniform ($d$-wave) superconducting (SC) order, PDW/SC, spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry - and thus is distinct from a simpler phase, SC/CDW, with coexisting SC and charge-density-wave (CDW) order. The PDW/SC phase exhibits three Higgs modes, one of which is sharply peaked and is predominantly a PDW fluctuation, symmetric between ${Q}$ and -${Q}$, whose damping rate is strongly reduced by SC. This sharp mode should be visible in Raman experiments.

Title: Topolectrical space-time circuits
Authors: Weixuan Zhang, Wenhui Cao, Long Qian, Hao Yuan, Xiangdong Zhang
Abstract: Topolectrical circuits have emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing static topological states that are challenging to construct in other systems, facilitating the design of robust circuit devices. In addition to spatial dimensionality, synergistic engineering of both temporal and spatial degrees in circuit networks holds tremendous potential across diverse technologies, such as wireless communications, non-reciprocal electronics and dynamic signal controls with exotic space-time topology. However, the realization of space-time modulated circuit networks is still lacking due to the necessity for flexible modulation of node connections in both spatial and temporal domains. Here, we propose a new class of topolectrical circuits, referred to as topolectrical space-time circuits, to bridge this gap. By designing and applying a novel time-varying circuit element controlled by external voltages, we can construct circuit networks exhibiting discrete space-time translational symmetries in any dimensionality, where the circuit dynamical equation is in the same form with time-dependent Schrodinger equation. Through the implementation of topolectrical space-time circuits, three distinct types of topological space-time crystals are experimentally demonstrated, including the (1+1)-dimensional topological space-time crystal with midgap edge modes, (2+1)-dimensional topological space-time crystal with chiral edge states, and (3+1)-dimensional Weyl space-time semimetals. Our work establishes a solid foundation for the exploration of intricate space-time topological phenomena and holds potential applications in the field of dynamically manipulating electronic signals with unique space-time topology

Title: Topological Influence of Sextets on Graphene Oxide Nanostructure
Authors: Musiri M Balakrishnarajan, Gaurav Jhaa, Pattath D Pancharatna
Abstract: Graphene Oxide (GO) remains a perennial chemical enigma despite its utility in preparing graphene and its functionalization. Epoxides and tertiary alcohols are construed as primary functional groups, but the structural motifs, spectra, and physicochemical properties remain largely inexplicable. Our graph theoretic perturbational analysis of introducing defects (sp3 carbons) on graphene shows the induction of sextets that topologically force 1, 4-quinoidal channels. Edge defects minimize these, whose propagation is halted by vertex anti-defects. Molecular models show that epoxidation creates a diradical centered on two cove-end carbons due to close-lying frontier orbitals. This drives the cascade addition of hydroxides, yielding the 1:2 ratio of epoxides and hydroxides. This nanostructure accounts for the cation exchange, acidity, anionic nature of GO, and topological conditions that break its sigma framework. The simulated spectra of a 2D sheet with this nanostructure correlate pleasantly with experiments, emphasizing the dominant role of sextet topology on the surface chemistry of graphene.

Title: Nonlinear optical response in a ferromagnetic insulating manganite: Pr$_{0.8}$Ca$_{0.2}$MnO$_{3}$
Authors: A. Nakano, K. Uchida, Y. Tomioka, M. Takaya, Y. Okimoto, K. Tanaka
Abstract: High harmonic generation from Pr$_{0.8}$Ca$_{0.2}$MnO$_{3}$ was investigated across a high-temperature paramagnetic phase and a low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. As the temperature decreases, the harmonic intensity gradually increases in the paramagnetic phase like that in different composition material Pr$_{0.6}$Ca$_{0.4}$MnO$_{3}$. However, it turns to a decrease in the ferromagnetic phase. We propose a possible interpretation of the anomaly around the ferromagnetic transition temperature considering the thermal fluctuation of orbital order and the metal-insulator phase separation in the ferromagnetic insulating phase.

Title: Field Theory of Birhythmicity
Authors: Sergei Shmakov, Peter B. Littlewood
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics are present in many aspects of our lives, ranging from microscopic physical systems to the functioning of the brain. What characterizes stochastic models of non-equilibrium processes is the breaking of the fluctuation-dissipation relations as well as the existence of non-static stable states, or phases. A prototypical example is a dynamical phase characterized by a limit cycle - the order parameter of finite magnitude rotating or oscillating at a fixed frequency. Consequently, birhythmicity, where two stable limit cycles coexist, is a natural extension of the simpler single limit cycle phase. Both the abundance of real systems exhibiting such states as well as their relevance for building our understanding of non-equilibrium phases and phase transitions are strong motivations to build and study models of such behavior. Field theoretic tools can be used to provide insights into either phase and the transition between them. In this work we explore a simple linear model of the single limit cycle phase with phase-amplitude coupling. We demonstrate how such non-equilibrium coupling affects the fluctuation spectrum of the theory. We then extend this model to include a continuous transition to a two-cycle phase. We give various results, such as an appearance of a critical exceptional point, the destruction of the transition, enhancement of noise for the phase and the presence of KPZ dynamics. Finally, we qualitatively demonstrate these results with numerics and discuss future directions.

Title: Enhancing Unconventional Spin-Orbit Torque Efficiency: First Numerical Study on the Influence of Crystallographic Texture and Polycrystalline Effects on Low-Symmetry Materials
Authors: Yifei Yang, Jian-Ping Wang
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) has been extensively studied as a key mechanism in spintronics applications. However, conventional SOT materials limit the spin polarization direction to the in-plane orientation, which is suboptimal for efficient magnetization switching. Recently, spins currents with spin polarization along multiple directions have been observed in low-symmetry materials, offering a promising energy-efficient strategy for the field-free switching of magnetic materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. However, the efficiency of this mechanism is highly dependent on the crystallographic texture of the SOT materials, a critical factor that, to date, has not been quantitatively investigated. In this study, we present the first comprehensive numerical investigation into the impact of both in-plane and out-of-plane crystallographic textures of SOT materials on the unconventional SOT generated by Dresselhaus-like and out-of-plane spin polarizations. By employing a theoretical orientation distribution function, we calculate the effective unconventional SOT values for SOT materials with tunable crystallographic texture. This analysis provides a framework for the synthesis and optimization of future low-symmetry SOT materials for the first time, which can enhance operational efficiency for spintronics applications in magnetoresistive random-access memory and spin logic devices.

Title: First-principles Study of Metallic-atom Diffusion in Thermoelectric Material Mg$_3$Sb$_2$
Authors: Masayuki Ochi, Kazutaka Nishiguchi, Chul-Ho Lee, Kazuhiko Kuroki
Abstract: Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ is a promising thermoelectric material that consists of nontoxic and earth-abundant elements. We investigate metallic-atom diffusion in Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ by calculating the defect formation energy and the diffusion energy barrier for several kinds of metallic-atom impurities. We find that early transition metals, including $4d$ elements, with a large atomic radius have a high defect formation energy, whereas Mg and late transition metals such as Ni, Cu, and Zn have relatively low formation energies as interstitial impurities. Interstitial Ni, which is found to have a very low defect formation energy, might diffuse in the $ab$ plane at high temperatures with the energy barrier of 0.7 eV, while it seems difficult to diffuse in the $c$ direction. Interstitial Cu has a higher defect formation energy than Ni but has a low energy barrier of $\sim$0.4 eV for diffusion in the $ab$ plane. This study will offer important knowledge for developing a thermoelectric device of Mg$_3$Sb$_2$.

Title: Prerequisite of superconductivity: SDW rather than tetragonal structure in double-layer La3Ni2O7-x
Authors: Mengzhu Shi, Di Peng, Yikang Li, Zhenfang Xing, Yuzhu Wang, Kaibao Fan, Houpu Li, Rongqi Wu, Zhidan Zeng, Qiaoshi Zeng, Jianjun Ying, Tao Wu, Xianhui Chen
Abstract: The pressure-induced high-temperature superconductivity(Tc) in nickelates La3Ni2O7-x has sparked significant interest to explore its superconductivity at ambient this http URL+1NinO3n+1(n=2,3)adopts an orthorhombic structure with tilted NiO6 octahedra and undergoes a spin-density-wave(SDW) transition at ambient pressure, while the octahedral tilting and the SDW are suppressed by pressure, and high pressure induces a structural transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal, and the high-Tc superconductivity is achieved in the tetragonal structure. This tetragonal structure is widely believed to be crucial for the pressure-induced superconductivity. Whether the pressure-stabilized tetragonal structure is a prerequisite for achieving nickelate superconductivity at ambient pressure is under hot debate. Here, by post-annealing of the orthorhombic La3Ni2O7-x as grown microcrystals with noticeable oxygen defects in high oxygen pressure environment, tetragonal La3Ni2O6.96 single crystals are successfully obtained at ambient pressure. In contrast to the orthorhombic La3Ni2O7-x, the tetragonal La3Ni2O7-x exhibits metallic behavior without a SDW transition at ambient pressure. Moreover, no superconductivity is observed at high pressure up to ~ 70 GPa. On the other hand, by utilizing Helium as the pressure medium, we have revisited the superconducting structure in pressurized orthorhombic La3Ni2O6.93. Our results indicate that the orthorhombic structure is quite robust against pressure, and no structural transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal happens, and the superconductivity under high pressure is achieved in orthorhombic structure rather than tetragonal structure claimed previously. All these results suggest that tetragonal structure is not prerequisite for achieving superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-x.

Title: Probing $k$-Space Alternating Spin Polarization via the Anomalous Hall Effect
Authors: Rui Chen, Zi-Ming Wang, Hai-Peng Sun, Bin Zhou, Dong-Hui Xu
Abstract: Altermagnets represent a recently discovered class of collinear magnets, characterized by antiparallel neighboring magnetic moments and alternating-sign spin polarization in momentum-space($k$-space). However, experimental methods for probing the $k$-space spin polarization in altermagnets remain limited. In this work, we propose an approach to address this challenge by interfacing an altermagnet with the surface of a topological insulator. The massless Dirac fermions on the topological insulator surface acquire a mass due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking. The local $k$-space magnetic moment at the Dirac point directly determines both the sign and magnitude of this Dirac mass, resulting in an anomalous Hall effect. By measuring the Hall conductance, we can extract the local $k$-space magnetic moment. Moreover, we can map the global magnetic moment distribution by tuning the Dirac point position using an in-plane magnetic field, thereby revealing the $k$-space spin density of the altermagnet. This work establishes the Dirac fermion on the topological insulator surface as a sensitive probe for unveiling spin characters of altermagnets and those of other unconventional antiferromagnets.

Title: Out-of-time-order correlator computation based on discrete truncated Wigner approximation
Authors: Tatsuhiko Shirai, Takashi Mori
Abstract: We propose a method based on the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) for computing out-of-time-order correlators. This method is applied to long-range interacting quantum spin systems where the interactions decay as a power law with distance. As a demonstration, we use a squared commutator of local operators and its higher-order extensions that describe quantum information scrambling under Hamilton dynamics. Our results reveal that the DTWA method accurately reproduces the exact dynamics of the average spreading of quantum information (i.e., the squared commutator) across all time regimes in strongly long-range interacting systems. We also identify limitations in the DTWA method when capturing dynamics in weakly long-range interacting systems and the fastest spreading of quantum information. This work provides a new technique to study scrambling dynamics in long-range interacting quantum spin systems.

Title: On the multi-$\mathbf{q}$ characteristics of magnetic ground states of honeycomb cobalt oxides
Authors: Yuchen Gu, Xianghong Jin, Yuan Li
Abstract: The Kitaev honeycomb model has received significant attention for its exactly solvable quantum spin liquid ground states and fractionalized excitations. For realizing the model, layered cobalt oxides have been considered a promising platform. Yet, in contrast to the conventional wisdom about single-$\mathbf{q}$ zigzag magnetic order inferred from previous studies of the Na$_2$IrO$_3$ and $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ candidate materials, recent experiments on two of the representative honeycomb cobalt oxides, hexagonal Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ and monoclinic Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$, have uncovered evidence for more complex multi-$\mathbf{q}$ variants of the zigzag order. This review surveys on experimental strategies to distinguish between single- and multi-$\mathbf{q}$ orders, along with the crystallographic symmetries of the cobalt oxides in comparison to the previously studied systems. General formation mechanism of multi-$\mathbf{q}$ order is also briefly discussed. The goal is to provide some rationales for examining the relevance of multi-$\mathbf{q}$ order in the honeycomb cobalt oxides, along with its implications on the microscopic model of these intriguing quantum magnets.

Title: Observation of Giant Orbital Hall Effect in Si

Abstract: Controlling/storing information carriers, such as electron charge and spin, is key for modern information society, and significant efforts have been paid made to establish novel technologies at the nanoscale. The rise of Si-based semiconductor technology and magnetism-based technology has been motivated by the aforementioned demands. However, both technologies have been individually developed, with little effort in fusing them. Hence, establishing a technology to bridge semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies that would allow realization of a novel information device is strongly awaited. In line with this research strategy, the creation of a magnetic device using semiconductors would enable fundamental innovation. Here, we show that a mother material for modern electronics, Si, gives rise to a giant room-temperature orbital Hall effect (OHE), enabling the creation of novel energy-efficient magnetic memory via efficient torque generation. The orbital torque efficiency largely exceeds that of the archetypal metallic materials used in the OHE. Our achievement overtures the conventional understanding that nonmagnetic semiconductors cannot play a pivotal role in magnetic devices and paves a new avenue for creating novel information devices through the fusion of semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies.

Title: Thermal and dimensional stability of photocatalytic material ZnPS$_3$ under extreme environmental conditions

Abstract: Zinc phosphorus trisulfide (ZnPS$_3$), a promising material for photocatalysis and energy storage, is shown in this study to exhibit remarkable stability under extreme conditions. We explore its optical and structural properties under high pressure and cryogenic temperatures using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, Raman scattering, and density functional theory (DFT). Our results identify a pressure-induced phase transition starting at 6.75 GPa and stabilizing by 12.5 GPa, after which ZnPS$_3$ demonstrates robust stability across a broad pressure range of 15 to 100 GPa. DFT calculations predict a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition at 100 GPa, while PL measurements reveal defect-assisted emissions that quench under pressure due to enhanced non-radiative recombination. At cryogenic temperatures, PL quenching intensifies as non-radiative processes dominate, driven by a rising Grüneisen parameter and reduced phonon population. Cryogenic X-ray diffraction (XRD) also reveals a high mean thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of (4.369 $\pm$ 0.393) $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ K$^{-1}$, among the highest reported for 2D materials. This unique combination of tunable electronic properties under low pressure and high thermal sensitivity makes ZnPS$_3$ a strong candidate for sensing applications in extreme environments.

Title: Optical Response of Multi-orbital Superconductors: Role of Fermi Surface Topology and Geometry
Authors: Meghdad Yazdani-Hamid, Mehdi Biderang, Alireza Akbari
Abstract: Motivated by the possibility of shifting the nearest peak in the density of states relative to the Fermi level leading to a Lifshitz transition, such as through strain in Sr$^{}_2$RuO$^{}_4$, this study examines the consequent effects on Hall transport and the polar Kerr angle. Using a three-orbital model, variations in the chemical potential and $z$-direction hopping reveal $d+ig$- and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairings as leading candidates for pairing symmetry in the quasi-2D orbital within the weak-coupling regime. The Lifshitz transition is further analyzed for its impact on coherence factors and the density of states, both of which are crucial to response functions. Interactions with van Hove points and nearby degenerate electronic states emerge as key contributors to Hall-type responses, while electron transfer between quasi-1D and quasi-2D orbitals significantly modifies these transport properties.

Title: Natural and Intrinsic Vacancies in two-dimensional g-C$_3$N$_4$ for Trapping Isolated B and C Atoms as Color Centers
Authors: Manqi You, Chaoyu He, Gencai Guo, Jianxin Zhong
Abstract: Color centers are vital for quantum information processing, but traditional ones often suffer from instability, difficulty in realization, and precise control of locations. In contrast, natural intrinsic vacancy-based color centers in two-dimensional systems offer enhanced stability and tunability. In this work, we demonstrate that g-C$_3$N$_4$ with natural intrinsic vacancies is highly suitable for trapping B/C atoms to form stable color centers as qubits. With easily identifiable vacancies, B/C atoms are expectable to be placed at the vacancy sites in g-C$_3$N$_4$ through STM manipulation. The vacancy sites are confirmed as the most stable adsorption positions, and once atoms are adsorbed, they are protected by diffusion barriers from thermal diffusions. The most stable charge states are C$_V^{+2}$/B$_V^{+2}$, C$_V^{+1}$/B$_V^{+1}$, and C$_V^0$/B$_V^0$ in turn, with charge transition levels of 0.39 eV and 2.49 eV, respectively. Specifically, the defect levels and net spin of C$_V$/B$_V$ can be adjusted by charge states. C$_V$, C$_V^{+1}$, C$_V^{+2}$, B$_V^{+1}$, and B$_V^{+2}$ exhibit optically allowable defect transition levels. The zero-phonon lines suggest fluorescence wavelengths fall within the mid-infrared band, ideal for qubit operations of stable initialization and readout. Furthermore, the Zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameter and the characteristic hyperfine tensor are provided as potential fingerprints for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments.

Title: Microscopic study of 3D Potts phase transition via Fuzzy Sphere Regularization
Authors: Shuai Yang, Yan-Guang Yue, Yin Tang, Chao Han, W. Zhu, Yan Chen
Abstract: The Potts model describes interacting spins with $Q$ different components, which is a direct generalization of the Ising model ($Q=2$). Compared to the existing exact solutions in 2D, the phase transitions and critical phenomena in the 3D Potts model have been less explored. Here, we systematically investigate a quantum $(2+1)$-D Potts model with $Q=3$ using a fuzzy sphere regularization scheme. We first construct a microscopic model capable of achieving a magnetic phase transition that separates a spin $S_3$ permutationally symmetric paramagnet and a spontaneous symmetry-breaking ferromagnet. Importantly, the energy spectrum at the phase transition point exhibits an approximately conformal symmetry, implying that an underlying conformal field theory may govern this transition. Moreover, when tuning along the phase transition line in the mapped phase diagram, we find that the dimension of the subleading $S_3$ singlet operator flows and drifts around the critical value $\sim 3$, which is believed to be crucial for understanding this phase transition, although determining its precise value remains challenging due to the limitations of our finite-size calculations. These findings suggest a discontinuous transition in the 3D 3-state Potts model, characterized by pseudo-critical behavior, which we argue results from a nearby multicritical or complex fixed point.

Title: Optimal disk packing of chloroplasts in plant cells
Authors: Nico Schramma, Eric R. Weeks, Maziyar Jalaal
Abstract: Photosynthesis is vital for the survival of entire ecosystems on Earth. While light is fundamental to this process, excessive exposure can be detrimental to plant cells. Chloroplasts, the photosynthetic organelles, actively move in response to light and self-organize within the cell to tune light absorption. These disk-shaped motile organelles must balance dense packing for enhanced light absorption under dim conditions with spatial rearrangements to avoid damage from excessive light exposure. Here, we reveal that the packing characteristics of chloroplasts within plant cells show signatures of optimality. Combining measurements of chloroplast densities and three-dimensional cell shape in the water plant Elodea densa, we construct an argument for optimal cell shape versus chloroplast size to achieve two targets: dense packing into a two-dimensional monolayer for optimal absorption under dim light conditions and packing at the sidewalls for optimal light avoidance. We formalize these constraints using a model for random close packing matched with packing simulations of polydisperse hard disks confined within rectangular boxes. The optimal cell shape resulting from these models corresponds closely to that measured in the box-like plant cells, highlighting the importance of particle packing in the light adaptation of plants. Understanding the interplay between structure and function sheds light on how plants achieve efficient photo adaptation. It also highlights a broader principle: how cell shape relates to the optimization of packing finite and relatively small numbers of organelles under confinement. This universal challenge in biological systems shares fundamental features with the mechanics of confined granular media and the jamming transitions in dense active and passive systems across various scales and contexts.

Title: Impact of Nonreciprocal Hopping on Localization in Non-Hermitian Quasiperiodic Systems
Authors: Xianqi Tong, Yiling Zhang, Bin Li, Xiaosen Yang
Abstract: We study the non-Hermitian Aubry-André-Harper model, incorporating complex phase modulation, unmodulated and modulated nonreciprocal hopping. Using Avila's global theory, we derive analytical phase boundaries and map out the phase diagrams, revealing extended, localized, critical, and skin phases unique to non-Hermitian systems. For complex phase modulation, we determine localization lengths through Lyapunov exponents and show that topological transitions align with localization transitions. In the nonreciprocal case, we use similarity transformations to confirm phase boundaries consistent with Avila's theory and uncover asymmetric localization behaviors. Importantly, modulated nonreciprocal hopping transforms both extended and critical phases into skin phases under open boundary conditions. These results highlight the interplay between topology, localization, and non-Hermitian effects, offering new perspectives on quasiperiodic systems.

Title: Crowding Effects during DNA Translocation in Nanopipettes
Authors: Rand A. Al-Waqfi, Cengiz Khan, Oliver J. Irving, Lauren Matthews, Tim Albrecht
Abstract: Quartz nanopipettes are an important emerging class of electric single-molecule sensors for DNA, proteins, their complexes as well as other biomolecular targets. However, in comparison to other resistive pulse sensors, nanopipettes constitute a highly asymmetric environment and the transport of ions and biopolymers can become strongly direction-dependent. For double-stranded DNA, this can include the characteristic translocation time and its tertiary structure, but as we show here, nanoconfinement can not only lead to unexplored features in the transport characteristics of the sensor, but also unlock new capabilities for biophysical and bioanalytical studies at the single-molecule level. To this end, we show how the accummulation of DNA inside the nanochannel leads to crowding effects, and in some cases reversible blocking of DNA entry, and provide a detailed analysis based on a range of different DNA samples and experimental conditions. Moreover, using biotin-functionalised DNA and streptavidin-modified gold nanoparticles as target, we demonstrate in a proof-of-concept study how the crowding effect, and the resulting increased residence time in nanochannel, can be exploited in a new analytical paradigm, involving DNA injection into the nanochannel, incubation with the nanoparticle target and analysis of the complex by reverse translocation. We thereby integrate elements of sample processing and detection into the nanopipette, as an important conceptual advance, and make a case for the wider applicability of this device concept.

Title: Lower bound of entropy production at short time scales for noise-driven stochastic systems
Authors: Mairembam Kelvin Singh, R.K. Brojen Singh, Moirangthem Shubhakanta Singh
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics governs that nonequilibrium systems evolve towards states of higher entropy over time. However, it does not specify the rate of this evolution and the role of fluctuations that impact the system's dynamics. Entropy production quantifies how far a system is driven away from equilibrium and provides a measure of irreversibility. In stochastic systems, entropy production becomes essential for understanding the approach to nonequilibrium states. While macroscopic observations provide valuable insights, they often overlook the local behaviors of the system, governed by fluctuations. In this study, we focus on measuring the lower bound of entropy production at short time scales for generalized stochastic systems by calculating the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the probability density functions of forward and backward trajectories. By analysing the entropy production across sliding time scales, we uncover patterns that reveal distinctions between local, small-scale dynamics and the global, macroscopic behavior, offering deeper insights into the system's departure from equilibrium. We also analysed the effects of switching to different types of noise or fluctuations and found that the observations at larger time scales provide no distinction between the different forms of noise while at short time scales, the distinction is significant.

Title: Conditions for orbital-selective altermagnetism in Sr2RuO4: tight-binding model, similarities with cuprates, and implications for superconductivity
Authors: Carmine Autieri, Giuseppe Cuono, Debmalya Chakraborty, Paola Gentile, Annica M. Black-Schaffer
Abstract: The vibrational modes in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ easily induce octahedral rotations without tilting. Being on the verge of a magnetic instability, such propensity of octahedral rotation may also produce magnetic fluctuations. In this work, we analyze the long-range magnetic phase diagram incorporating such octahedral rotations and demonstrate the possibility of an altermagnetic phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Using ab-initio calculations, we first study single layer Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ with octahedral rotations, obtaining an orbital-selective $g$-wave altermagnetic phase. We further provide an effective $t_{2g}$ tight-binding model, demonstrating that the $g$-wave altermagnetism is primarily a product of second and third nearest neighbor interorbital hybridizations between the ${\gamma}z$ ($\gamma=x,y$) orbitals, but only a much longer range intraorbital hybridization in the $xy$ orbitals, establishing a strong orbital-selectiveness for the altermagnetism. Notably, by replacing the $xy$ orbital with the $x^2-y^2$ orbital, a similar tight-biding model may be used to investigate the hole-doped cuprate superconductors. We then study bulk Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, where we find the altermagnetic phase as the magnetic ground state for a range of finite octahedral rotations. In the bulk, interlayer hopping breaks some of the symmetries of the $g$-wave altermagnet, resulting in a $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnet, still with orbital selectiveness. We also include relativistic effects through spin-orbit coupling and obtain that an effective staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction generates weak ferromagnetism. Finally, we discuss the implications of the altermagnetic order on the intrinsic superconductivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Assuming in-plane and intraorbital pairing, the altermagnetism favors spin-singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave or $g$-wave pairing, or (nematic or chiral) combinations thereof.

Title: Anomalies in the electronic stopping of slow antiprotons in LiF
Authors: Guerda Massillon-JL, Alfredo A. Correa, Xavier Andrade, Emilio Artacho
Abstract: We present first-principles theoretical calculations for the electronic stopping power (SP) of both protons and anti-protons in LiF. Our results show the presence of the Barkas effect: a higher stopping for positively charged particles than their negatively charged antiparticles. In contrast, a previous study has predicted an anti-Barkas effect (higher stopping for negative charges) at low velocity [Qi, Bruneval and Maliyov, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 043401 (2022)]. We explain this discrepancy by showing that this anti-Barkas effect appears for highly symmetric trajectories and disappears when considering trajectories that better reproduce the experimental setup. Our low-velocity results show that the SP of both protons and anti-proton vanish for velocities under 0.1 a.u. .

Title: Integrating Deep-Learning-Based Magnetic Model and Non-Collinear Spin-Constrained Method: Methodology, Implementation and Application
Authors: Daye Zheng, Xingliang Peng, Yike Huang, Yinan Wang, Duo Zhang, Zhengtao Huang, Linfeng Zhang, Mohan Chen, Ben Xu, Weiqing Zhou
Abstract: We propose a non-collinear spin-constrained method that generates training data for deep-learning-based magnetic model, which provides a powerful tool for studying complex magnetic phenomena at the atomic scale. First, we propose a projection method for atomic magnetic moments by applying a radial truncation to the numerical atomic orbitals. We then implement a Lagrange multiplier method that can yield the magnetic torques of atoms by constraining the magnitude and direction of atomic magnetic moments. The method is implemented in ABACUS with both plane wave basis and numerical atomic orbital basis. We benchmark the iron (Fe) systems with the new method and analyze differences from calculations with the plane wave basis and numerical atomic orbitals basis in describing magnetic energy barriers. Based on more than 30,000 first-principles data with the information of magnetic torque, we train a deep-learning-based magnetic model DeePSPIN for the Fe system. By utilizing the model in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we successfully predict Curie temperatures of $\alpha$-Fe close to experimental values.

Title: Efficiently charting the space of mixed vacancy-ordered perovskites by machine-learning encoded atomic-site information
Authors: Fan Zhang, Li Fu, Weiwei Gao, Peihong Zhang, Jijun Zhao
Abstract: Vacancy-ordered double perovskites (VODPs) are promising alternatives to three-dimensional lead halide perovskites for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications. Mixing these materials creates a vast compositional space, allowing for highly tunable electronic and optical properties. However, the extensive chemical landscape poses significant challenges in efficiently screening candidates with target properties. In this study, we illustrate the diversity of electronic and optical characteristics as well as the nonlinear mixing effects on electronic structures within mixed VODPs. For mixed systems with limited local environment options, the information regarding atomic-site occupation in-principle determines both structural configurations and all essential properties. Building upon this concept, we have developed a model that integrates a data-augmentation scheme with a transformer-inspired graph neural network (GNN), which encodes atomic-site information from mixed systems. This approach enables us to accurately predict band gaps and formation energies for test samples, achieving Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) of 21 meV and 3.9 meV/atom, respectively. Trained with datasets that include (up to) ternary mixed systems and supercells with less than 72 atoms, our model can be generalized to medium- and high-entropy mixed VODPs (with 4 to 6 principal mixing elements) and large supercells containing more than 200 atoms. Furthermore, our model successfully reproduces experimentally observed bandgap bowing in Sn-based mixed VODPs and reveals an unconventional mixing effect that can result in smaller band gaps compared to those found in pristine systems.

Title: Molecular origins of colossal barocaloric effects in plastic crystals
Authors: Ares Sanuy, Carlos Escorihuela-Sayalero, Pol Lloveras, Josep Lluis Tamarit, Luis Carlos Pardo, Claudio Cazorla
Abstract: In recent years, orientationally disordered crystals, or plastic crystals, have transformed the field of solid-state cooling due to the significant latent heat and entropy changes associated with their temperature induced molecular order-disorder phase transition, which can produce colossal caloric effects under external field stimuli. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these huge caloric effects remain inadequately understood, and general principles for enhancing the performance of caloric plastic crystals are lacking. Previous studies have predominantly focused on molecular rotations, overlooking other potentially critical factors, such as lattice vibrations and molecular conformations. In this study, we employ classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to both replicate and elucidate the microscopic origins of the experimentally observed colossal barocaloric (BC) effects -- those driven by hydrostatic pressure -- in the archetypal plastic crystal neopentyl glycol (NPG). Our MD simulations demonstrate that in NPG, the combined BC response and phase-transition entropy changes arising from lattice vibrations and molecular conformations are nearly equal to those from molecular reorientations, contributing 45% and 55%, respectively. These findings suggest that, alongside hydrogen bonding -- which directly impacts molecular rotational dynamics -- lattice vibrational and molecular structural features, often overlooked, must be integrated into the rational design and modeling of advanced caloric plastic crystals. These insights are not only of significant fundamental interest but also essential for driving the development of next-generation solid-state refrigeration technologies.

Title: Bipartite Current Fluctuations in Quantum Wires through Charge Fractionalization
Authors: Magali Korolev, Karyn Le Hur
Abstract: Quantum information measures of many-body systems often imply a measure with multi- or two regions such as bipartite charge fluctuations within the ground state revealing the logarithmic profile of the entanglement entropy in a quantum wire. Here, we introduce a new method from the bipartite current fluctuations and the divergence theorem. They reveal the fractional charges related to ground-state energetics and the proximity to Mott physics in the same ballistic quantum wires. This also encodes the behavior of the electron Green's function in space. With metallic gates on both sides of an interface to implement the protocol introducing the two macroscopic domains, bipartite current fluctuations can reveal an additional localized bound state associated to the topological Jackiw-Rebbi model, coexisting with the fractional charges. Through the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm we introduce a quantum spin chain analogue.

Title: A chemical bonding based descriptor for predicting the impact of quantum nuclear and anharmonic effects on hydrogen-based superconductors
Authors: Francesco Belli, Eva Zurek, Ion Errea
Abstract: Quantum nuclear effects (QNEs) can significantly alter a material's crystal structure and phonon spectra, impacting properties such as thermal conductivity and superconductivity. However, predicting a priori whether these effects will enhance or suppress superconductivity, or destabilize a structure, remains a grand challenge. Herein, we address this unresolved problem by introducing a descriptor, based upon the integrated crystal orbital bonding index (iCOBI), to predict the influence of QNEs on a crystal lattice's dynamic stability, phonon spectra and superconducting properties. We find that structures with atoms in symmetric chemical bonding environments exhibit greater resilience to structural perturbations induced by QNEs, while those with atoms in asymmetric bonding environments are more susceptible to structural alterations, resulting in enhanced superconducting critical temperatures.

Title: Classical and quantum spin liquids
Authors: Sylvain Capponi
Abstract: When considering magnetic systems in the thermodynamic limit and at low enough temperature, one finds typically magnetically ordered phases. In contrast, in the high-temperature regime, the interactions between the spin degrees of freedom become less relevant and the system loses its order: this is a paramagnet. This phenomenon of phase transition has been well understood using statistical mechanics and simple modelling. In these short lecture notes, we will review the possibility that a many-body magnetic system may remain magnetically disordered down to zero-temperature, both for classical or quantum spins. These exotic phases of matter are known, respectively, as classical and quantum spin liquids. We will address in particular the question of classification of these classical or quantum disordered phases. Indeed, while they have no local order parameter by definition, they can still possess different qualitative features related e.g. to the nature of their correlations or elementary excitations, which could be probed experimentally.

Title: Electrically-tunable graphene nanomechanical resonators
Authors: Yi-Bo Wang, Zhuo-Zhi Zhang, Chen-Xu Wu, Yu-Shi Zhang, Guo-Sheng Lei, Xiang-Xiang Song, Guo-Ping Guo
Abstract: The excellent mechanical properties make graphene promising for realizing nanomechanical resonators with high resonant frequencies, large quality factors, strong nonlinearities, and the capability to effectively interface with various physical systems. Equipped with gate electrodes, it has been demonstrated that these exceptional device properties can be electrically manipulated, leading to a variety of nanomechanical/acoustic applications. Here, we review the recent progress of graphene nanomechanical resonators with a focus on their electrical tunability. First, we provide an overview of different graphene nanomechanical resonators, including their device structures, fabrication methods, and measurement setups. Then, the key mechanical properties of these devices, for example, resonant frequencies, nonlinearities, dissipations, and mode coupling mechanisms, are discussed, with their behaviors upon electrical gating being highlighted. After that, various potential classical/quantum applications based on these graphene nanomechanical resonators are reviewed. Finally, we briefly discuss challenges and opportunities in this field to offer future prospects of the ongoing studies on graphene nanomechanical resonators.

Title: Investigating topological in-gap states in non-Hermitian quasicrystal with unconventional $p$-wave pairing
Authors: Shaina Gandhi, Jayendra N. Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: The interplay of onsite quasiperiodic potential, superconductivity, and non-Hermiticity is explored in a non-Hermitian unconventional superconducting quasicrystal described by Aubry-André-Harper (NHAAH) model with $p$-wave pairing. In previous studies, the non-Hermiticity was only considered at the onsite quasiperiodic potential of the NHAAH model, and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) were observed under open boundary conditions (OBC) in this model. In this work, we study an NHAAH model with $p$-wave pairing, where non-Hermiticity is considered onsite by introducing complex quasiperiodic potential and asymmetry at the hopping part. Our analysis uncovers triple-phase transitions, where topological, metal-insulator, and unconventional real-to-complex transitions coincide at weak $p$-wave pairing strength. Additionally, instead of the MZMs observed in the symmetric hopping case, we observe the emergence of in-gap states under OBC in this model. These in-gap states are robust against disorder, underscoring their topological protection. Therefore, unlike the MZMs, which are very challenging to experimentally realize, these in-gap states can be used in topological quantum computational protocols.

Title: Chern Vector Protected Three-dimensional Quantized Hall Effect
Authors: Zhi-Qiang Zhang, Shu-Guang Cheng, Hongfang Liu, Hailong Li, Hua Jiang, X. C. Xie
Abstract: Recently, Chern vector with arbitrary formula $\textbf{C}\!=\!(\mathcal{C}_{yz},\mathcal{C}_{xz},\mathcal{C}_{xy})$ in three-dimensional systems has been experimentally realized [\B{Nature 609, 925 (2022)}]. Motivated by these progresses, we propose the Chern vector $\textbf{C}\!=\!(0,m,n)$-protected quantized Hall effect in three-dimensional systems. By examining samples with Chern vector $\textbf{C}\!=\!(0,m,n)$ and dimensions $L_y$ and $L_z$ along the $y$- and $z$-directions, we demonstrate a topologically protected two-terminal response. This response can be reformulated as the sum of the transmission coefficients along the $x$- and $y$-directions, given by $(mL_y\!+\!nL_z)$. When applied to Hall bar setups, this topological mechanism gives rise to quantized Hall conductances, such as \(G_{xy}\) and \(G_{xz}\), which are expressed by $\pm(mL_y\!+\!nL_z)$. These Hall conductances exhibit a clear dependency on sample dimensions, illuminating the intrinsic three-dimensional nature. Finally, we propse potential candidates for experimental realization. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of the topological nature of Chern vectors but also enlighten the exploration of their transport properties.

Title: Imaging the Meissner Effect and Flux Trapping of Superconductors under High Pressure using N-V Centers
Authors: Cassandra Dailledouze, Antoine Hilberer, Martin Schmidt, Marie-Pierre Adam, Loïc Toraille, Kin On Ho, Anne Forget, Dorothée Colson, Paul Loubeyre, Jean-François Roch
Abstract: Pressure is a key parameter for tuning or revealing superconductivity in materials and compounds. Many measurements of superconducting phase transition temperatures have been conducted using diamond anvil cells (DACs), which provide a wide pressure range and enable concomitant microscopic structural characterization of the sample. However, the inherently small sample volumes in DACs complicate the unambiguous detection of the Meissner effect, the hallmark of superconductivity. Recently, the Meissner effect in superconductors within a DAC was successfully demonstrated using diamond nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) widefield magnetometry, a non-invasive optical technique. In this work, we show that N-V magnetometry can also map superconductivity with micrometer resolution. We apply this technique to a microcrystal of HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg-1223) mercury-based cuprate superconductor under 4 GPa of pressure. The method is capable to detect the magnetic field expulsion and heterogeneities in the sample, visible in a set of characteristic parameters as the local critical temperature $T_{c}$. Flux pinning zones are identified through flux trapping maps. This approach could enable detailed investigations of superconductivity of a broad range of materials under high-pressure conditions.

Title: Scanning gate microscopy detection of Majorana bound states
Authors: S. Maji, M. P. Nowak
Abstract: We theoretically study scanning gate microscopy of a superconductor-proximitized semiconducting wire focusing on the possibility of detection of Majorana bound states. We exploit the possibility to create local potential perturbation by the scanning gate tip which allows controllable modification of the spatial distribution of the Majorana modes, which is translated into changes in their energy structure. When the tip scans across the system, it effectively divides the wire into two parts with controllable lengths, in which two pairs of Majorana states are created when the system is in the topological regime. For strong values of the tip potential the pairs are decoupled, and the presence of Majorana states can be detected via local tunneling spectroscopy that resolves the energy splittings resulting from the Majorana states wave functions overlap. Importantly, as the system is probed spatially via the tip, this technique can distinguish Majorana bound states from quasi-Majorana states localized on smooth potential barriers. We demonstrate that for weaker tip potentials the two neighboring Majorana states hybridize opening pronounced anticrossings in the energy spectra which are reflected in local conductance maps and which result in non-zero non-local conductance features. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of the disorder on the scanning gate microscopy spectroscopy maps.

Title: Designing edge currents using mesoscopic patterning in chiral d-wave superconductors
Authors: Patric Holmvall, Annica M. Black-Schaffer
Abstract: Chiral superconductors are topological as characterized by a finite Chern number and chiral edge modes. Direct fingerprints of chiral superconductivity is thus often taken to be spontaneous edge currents with associated magnetic signatures. However, a number of recent theoretical studies have shown that the total edge current along semi-infinite edges is greatly reduced or even vanishes in many scenarios for all pairing symmetries except chiral $p$-wave, thus impeding experimental detection. We demonstrate how mesoscopic finite-sized samples can be designed to give rise to a shape- and size-dependent strong enhancement of the chiral edge currents and their generated orbital magnetic moment and magnetic fields. In particular, we find that low rotational symmetry systems, such as pentagons and hexagons, give rise to the largest currents, while circular disks also generate large currents but in the opposite direction. The current and magnetic signatures diverge with shrinking system sizes, eventually cut-off by finite-size suppression of chiral superconductivity. We thus also extract the full phase diagram as a function of temperature and system size for different geometries, including competing superconducting orders. Our results are relevant for system sizes on the order of tens to hundreds of coherence lengths, and highlight mesoscopic patterning as a viable route to experimentally identify chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.

Title: Ambient pressure growth of bilayer nickelate single crystals with superconductivity over 90 K under high pressure

Abstract: Recently, the Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has been discovered as a high temperature superconductor with Tc near 80 K above 14 GPa.[1-3] The search for nickelate superconductors with higher Tc, the preparation of high-quality single crystals, and the removal of high-pressure conditions including single crystal growth under high gas pressure and achievement of high Tc superconductivity under high pressure, are the most challenging tasks. Here, we present ambient pressure flux growth of high-quality bilayer nickelate single crystals with superconductivity up to 91 K under high pressure. Single crystals of bilayer La3-xRxNi2O7-y with dimensions up to 220 um on the edge were successfully grown using flux method at atmosphere conditions. Single crystal X-ray diffraction, nuclear quadrupole resonance, energy dispersion spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements evidenced high quality of bilayer La2SmNi2O7-y single crystals in average structure and local structure. Superconductivity has been observed in high pressure resistivity measurements of annealed La2SmNi2O7-y single crystals with Tc onset up to 91 K, which is the highest among the known superconducting nickelates. Our results not only demonstrate a new and easy-to-access method for synthesizing high-quality bilayer nickelate single crystals, but also providing a direction for discovering superconducting nickelates with higher Tc.

Title: Magnetic and crystal electric field studies of two Yb$^{3+}$-based triangular lattice antiferromagnets
Authors: S. Guchhait, R. Kolay, A. Magar, R. Nath
Abstract: We present the low-temperature magnetic properties of two Yb$^{3+}$-based triangular lattice compounds NaSrYb(BO$_3$)$_2$ and K$_3$YbSi$_2$O$_7$ via thermodynamic measurements followed by crystal electric field (CEF) calculations. Magnetization and specific heat data as well as the CEF energy levels confirm that the ground state is characterized by the low-lying Kramers' doublet of Yb$^{3+}$ with effective spin-1/2 ($J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$). A small Curie-Weiss temperature and scaling of magnetic isotherms corroborate very weak magnetic correlations among $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ spins. The crystal field parameters are calculated using the point charge model and the CEF Hamiltonian is determined for both the compounds. The simulation using the eigenvalues of the CEF Hamiltonian reproduces the experimental susceptibility, magnetic isotherm, and magnetic specific heat data very well. The large separation between the ground state and first excited state doublets implies that the ground state is a Kramers' doublet with $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ at low temperatures, endorsing the experimental findings.

Title: Phase-controlled minimal Kitaev chain in multiterminal Josephson junctions
Authors: Samuel D. Escribano, Anders Enevold Dahl, Karsten Flensberg, Yuval Oreg
Abstract: We propose a nanodevice based on multi-terminal Josephson junctions for the creation and detection of poor man's Majorana (PMM) modes. The device consists of a double three-terminal Josephson junction (3TJJ) embedded in a planar semiconductor that engineers a two-site Kitaev chain. We identify the conditions necessary for the emergence of PMM modes by precisely tuning the superconducting phases of the terminals and the inter-junction coupling between the 3TJJs. To validate our findings, we perform numerical simulations that account for disorder in a more general geometry, and test experimentally feasible protocols based on conductance measurements to reliably detect these modes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on magnetic fields, our design eliminates the need for such fields, potentially increasing the energy-level resolution and significantly expanding the range of compatible semiconductor materials, such as Ge-based heterostructures.

Title: New phase space of hardness materials and synergic enhancement of hardness and toughness in superconducting Ti2Co and Ti4Co2X (X = B, C, N, O)

Abstract: Compared to traditional superhard materials with high electron density and strong covalent bonds, alloy materials mainly composed of metallic bonding structures typically have great toughness and lower hardness. Breaking through the limits of alloy materials is a preface and long term topic, which is of great significance and value for improving the comprehensive mechanical properties of alloy materials. Here, we report on the discovery of a cubic alloy semiconducting material Ti2Co with large Vickers of hardness Hvexp = 6.7 GPa and low fracture toughness of KICexp =1.51 MPa m0.5. Unexpectedly, the former value is nearly triple of the Hvcal = 2.66 GPa predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the latter value is about one or two orders of magnitude smaller than that of ordinary titanium alloy materials (KICexp = 30-120 MPa m0.5).These specifications place Ti2Co far from the phase space of the known alloy materials, but close to medium hardness materials such as MgO or TiO2. Upon incorporation of oxygen into structural void positions, both values were simultaneously improved for Ti4Co2O to = 9.7 GPa and 2.19 MPa m0.5, respectively. Further DFT calculations on the electron localization function of Ti4Co2X (X = B, C, N, O) vs. the interstitial elements indicate that these simultaneous improvements originate from the coexistence of Ti-Co metallic bonds, the emergence of newly oriented Ti-X covalent bonds, and the increase of electron concentration. Moreover, the large difference between Hvexp and Hvcal of Ti2Co suggests underlying mechanism concerning the absence of the O(16d) or Ti2-O bonds in the O-(Ti2)6 this http URL discovery expands the phase space of alloy materials and illuminates the path of exploring superconducting materials with excellent mechanical performances.

Title: A dressed singlet-triplet qubit in germanium

Hendrickx, Stephen W. Bedell, Stephan Paredes, Felix J. Schupp, Matthias Mergenthaler, Gian Salis, Andreas Fuhrer, Patrick Harvey-Collard
Abstract: In semiconductor hole spin qubits, low magnetic field ($B$) operation extends the coherence time ($T_\mathrm{2}^*$) but proportionally reduces the gate speed. In contrast, singlet-triplet (ST) qubits are primarily controlled by the exchange interaction ($J$) and can thus maintain high gate speeds even at low $B$. However, a large $J$ introduces a significant charge component to the qubit, rendering ST qubits more vulnerable to charge noise when driven. Here, we demonstrate a highly coherent ST hole spin qubit in germanium, operating at both low $B$ and low $J$. By modulating $J$, we achieve resonant driving of the ST qubit, obtaining an average gate fidelity of $99.68\%$ and a coherence time of $T_\mathrm{2}^*=1.9\,\mu$s. Moreover, by applying the resonant drive continuously, we realize a dressed ST qubit with a tenfold increase in coherence time ($T_\mathrm{2\rho}^*=20.3\,\mu$s). Frequency modulation of the driving signal enables universal control, with an average gate fidelity of $99.64\%$. Our results demonstrate the potential for extending coherence times while preserving high-fidelity control of germanium-based ST qubits, paving the way for more efficient operations in semiconductor-based quantum processors.

Title: Machine Learning Inversion from Small-Angle Scattering for Charged Polymers
Authors: Lijie Ding, Chi-Huan Tung, Jan-Michael Y. Carrillo, Wei-Ren Chen, Changwoo Do
Abstract: We develop Monte Carlo simulations for uniformly charged polymers and machine learning algorithm to interpret the intra-polymer structure factor of the charged polymer system, which can be obtained from small-angle scattering experiments. The polymer is modeled as a chain of fixed-length bonds, where the connected bonds are subject to bending energy, and there is also a screened Coulomb potential for charge interaction between all joints. The bending energy is determined by the intrinsic bending stiffness, and the charge interaction depends on the interaction strength and screening length. All three contribute to the stiffness of the polymer chain and lead to longer and larger polymer conformations. The screening length also introduces a second length scale for the polymer besides the bending persistence length. To obtain the inverse mapping from the structure factor to these polymer conformation and energy-related parameters, we generate a large data set of structure factors by running simulations for a wide range of polymer energy parameters. We use principal component analysis to investigate the intra-polymer structure factors and determine the feasibility of the inversion using the nearest neighbor distance. We employ Gaussian process regression to achieve the inverse mapping and extract the characteristic parameters of polymers from the structure factor with low relative error.

Title: Terahertz-induced second-harmonic generation in quantum paraelectrics: hot-phonon effect
Authors: F. Yang, X. J. Li, D. Talbayev, L. Q. Chen
Abstract: Recent terahertz-pump second-harmonic-generation(SHG)-probe measurements of quantum paraelectrics observed a significant long-lived non-oscillatory SHG component following an ultrafast resonant excitation of the soft mode, which was interpreted as a signature of terahertz-induced transient ferroelectric order. Here we propose a temperature-dependent dynamic model incorporating the hot-phonon effect to simulate the soft-mode behaviors under ultrafast terahertz excitation. Its application to paraelectric KTaO3 produces quantitatively most of the features exhibited in our time-resolved SHG measurements and those in existing literature, including a long-lived non-oscillatory SHG response, SHG oscillations at twice the soft-mode frequency, SHG dampings as well as temperature and field-strength dependencies. We conclude that the observed terahertz-induced non-oscillatory SHG response in quantum paraelectrics is a consequence of the induced nonequilibrium hot-phonon effect, offering an alternative to its existing interpretation as a signature of transient ferroelectric order.

Title: Impact of phonon lifetimes on the single-photon indistinguishability in quantum emitters based on 2D materials
Authors: Alexander Steinhoff, Steffen Wilksen, Ivan Solovev, Christian Schneider, Christopher Gies
Abstract: Localized excitons in two-dimensional (2D) materials are considered as promising sources of single photons on demand. The photon indistinguishability as key figure of merit for quantum information processing is strongly influenced by the coupling of charge excitations to lattice vibrations of the surrounding semiconductor material. Here, we quantify the impact of exciton-acoustic-phonon-interaction and cavity QED effects on photon indistinguishability in a Hong-Ou-Mandel setup by solving fully quantum mechanical equations for the coupled QD-cavity-phonon system including non-Markovian effects. We find a strong reduction of indistinguishability compared to 3D systems due to increased exciton-phonon coupling efficiency. Moreover, we show that the coherence properties of photons are significantly influenced by the finite phonon lifetime in the surrounding material giving rise to pure dephasing. Only if these limitations can be overcome, localized excitons in 2D semiconductors can become a new avenue for quantum light sources.

Title: Landscape of Correlated Orders in Strained Bilayer Nickelate Thin Films
Authors: Congcong Le, Jun Zhan, Xianxin Wu, Jiangping Hu
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has sparked significant research interest. This interest has been further fueled by the recent achievement of superconductivity in compressed thin films at ambient pressure, although the origin and underlying mechanism remain elusive. In this work, we explore the electronic structures and instabilities of strained thin films on substrates to identify the key factors for achieving superconductivity, using first-principles and functional renormalization group calculations. Our findings suggest that the compressed NiO$_2$ bilayer near the interface is unlikely to exhibit superconductivity, despite its electron-doped nature. In contrast, the NiO$_2$ bilayer away from the interface shows density-wave instability when undoped or slightly hole-doped. However, when this bilayer is hole-doped, leading to the emergence of a hole pocket around the M point, it exhibits robust $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity, which may account for superconductivity observed in thin films. For the stretched NiO$_2$ bilayer, robust spin-density-wave instability is observed due to enhanced Fermi surface nesting, despite the presence of a hole pocket around the M point. Potential experimental implications are discussed. Our study highlights the crucial role of fermiology in determining electronic instability and establishes a unified scenario for superconductivity in both pressurized bulk and strained thin films of bilayer nickelates.

Title: Thermomechanical Processing of Pure Magnesium: Hot Extrusion, Hot Rolling and Cold Drawing
Authors: Mohamad Amin Kalateh, Naeime Talebi, Soroush Nekoei, Mohamad Mahdi Novini, Farzad Khodabakhshi, Mahmoud Nili-Ahmadabadi
Abstract: A comprehensive study on thermomechanical processing of pure Mg was conducted through sequential hot extrusion, hot rolling, and cold drawing operations. Three different extrusion ratios (6:1, 25:1, and 39:1) were investigated at 350°C, revealing that 39:1 ratio produced an optimal bimodal grain structure with beneficial twin morphology. Subsequently, hot rolling experiments were performed at varying linear speeds (26- and 130-mm s-1) and interpass annealing times (2.5 and 10 minutes). Results demonstrated that higher rolling speeds led to finer microstructure, while longer interpass annealing times resulted in reduced twin fraction and more inhomogeneous microstructure. The processed material was then subjected to cold drawing with approximately 12% true strain per pass. Different annealing conditions (275°C and 375°C for 2.5-10 minutes) between drawing passes were evaluated. Analysis showed that annealing at 375°C for 2.5-5 minutes provided optimal softening for subsequent deformation. Fracture analysis revealed a mixed ductile-brittle behavior, with twin-matrix interfaces serving as preferred crack propagation paths This study establishes optimal processing parameters for pure Mg wire production, highlighting the critical role of twin characteristics and restoration processes in determining material formability during multi-step thermomechanical processing.

Title: Enhanced Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy with Adaptive Physics Informed Deep Autoencoders
Authors: Zaheer Ahmad, Junaid Shabeer, Usman Saleem, Tahir Qadeer, Abdul Sami, Zahira El Khalidi, Saad Mehmood
Abstract: We present a physics-informed deep learning framework to address common limitations in Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM), such as diffraction limited resolution, noise, and undersampling due to low laser power conditions. The optical system's point spread function (PSF) and common CLSM image degradation mechanisms namely photon shot noise, dark current noise, motion blur, speckle noise, and undersampling were modeled and were directly included into model architecture. The model reconstructs high fidelity images from heavily noisy inputs by using convolutional and transposed convolutional layers. Following the advances in compressed sensing, our approach significantly reduces data acquisition requirements without compromising image resolution. The proposed method was extensively evaluated on simulated CLSM images of diverse structures, including lipid droplets, neuronal networks, and fibrillar systems. Comparisons with traditional deconvolution algorithms such as Richardson-Lucy (RL), non-negative least squares (NNLS), and other methods like Total Variation (TV) regularization, Wiener filtering, and Wavelet denoising demonstrate the superiority of the network in restoring fine structural details with high fidelity. Assessment metrics like Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), underlines that the AdaptivePhysicsAutoencoder achieved robust image enhancement across diverse CLSM conditions, helping faster acquisition, reduced photodamage, and reliable performance in low light and sparse sampling scenarios holding promise for applications in live cell imaging, dynamic biological studies, and high throughput material characterization.

Abstract: Rare earth chalcogenides provide a great platform to study exotic quantum phenomena such as superconductivity and charge density waves. Among various interesting properties, the coupling between magnetism and electronic transport has attracted significant attention. Here, we report the investigation of such coupling in {alpha}-Gd2Se3 single crystals through magnetic, calorimetric, and transport property measurements. {alpha}-Gd2Se3 is found to display an antiferromagnetic ground state below 11 K with metamagnetic spin-flop transitions. The magnetic fluctuations remain strong above the transition temperature. Transport measurements reveal an overall metallic transport behavior with a large negative magnetoresistance of ~ 65% near the magnetic transition temperature, together with positive MR near the field-induced spin-flop transitions, which can be understood in terms of the suppression of spin scattering by the magnetic field.

Title: Dualities between 2+1d fusion surface models from braided fusion categories
Authors: Luisa Eck
Abstract: Fusion surface models generalize the concept of anyon chains to 2+1 dimensions, utilizing fusion 2-categories as their input. We investigate bond-algebraic dualities in these systems and show that distinct module tensor categories $\mathcal{M}$ over the same braided fusion category $\mathcal{B}$ give rise to dual lattice models. This extends the 1+1d result that dualities in anyon chains are classified by module categories over fusion categories. We analyze two concrete examples: (i) a $\text{Rep}(S_3)$ model with a constrained Hilbert space, dual to the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ XXZ model on the honeycomb lattice, and (ii) a bilayer Kitaev honeycomb model, dual to a spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ model with XXZ and Ising interactions. Unlike regular $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{B}$ fusion surface models, which conserve only 1-form symmetries, models constructed from $\mathcal{M} \neq \mathcal{B}$ can exhibit both 1-form and 0-form symmetries, including non-invertible ones.

Title: Recurrence Plots for the Analysis of Complex Systems
Authors: Norbert Marwan, Maria Carmen Romano, Marco Thiel, Jürgen Kurths
Abstract: Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system's behaviour in phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980's. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantification of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantification analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system's behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own field of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difficulties and pitfalls.

Title: Interaction energies in nematic liquid crystal suspensions
Authors: Lia Bronsard, Xavier Lamy, Dominik Stantejsky, Raghavendra Venkatraman
Abstract: We establish, as $\rho\to 0$, an asymptotic expansion for the minimal Dirichlet energy of $\mathbb S^2$-valued maps outside a finite number of three-dimensional particles of size $\rho$ with fixed centers $x_j\in\mathbb{R}^3$, under general anchoring conditions at the particle boundaries. Up to a scaling factor, this expansion is of the form \begin{align*} E_\rho = \sum_j \mu_j -4\pi\rho \sum_{i\neq j} \frac{\langle v_i,v_j\rangle}{|x_i-x_j|} +o(\rho)\,, \end{align*} where $\mu_j$ is the minimal energy after zooming in at scale $\rho$ around each particle, and $v_j\in\mathbb{R}^3$ is a torque determined by the far-field behavior of the corresponding single-particle minimizer. The above expansion highlights Coulomb-like interactions between the particle centers. This agrees with the \textit{electrostatics analogy} commonly used in the physics literature for colloid interactions in nematic liquid crystal. That analogy was pioneered by Brochard and de Gennes in 1970, based on a formal linearization argument. We obtain here for the first time a precise estimate of the energy error introduced by this linearization procedure.

Title: Wafer-scale Integration of Single-Crystalline MoS$_2$ for Flexible Electronics Enabled by Oxide Dry-transfer
Authors: Xiang Xu, Yitong Chen, Jichuang Shen, Qi Huang, Tong Jiang, Han Chen, Huaze Zhu, Yaqing Ma, Hao Wang, Wenhao Li, Chen Ji, Dingwei Li, Siyu Zhang, Yan Wang, Bowen Zhu, Wei Kong
Abstract: Atomically thin, single-crystalline transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on sapphire substrates exhibit exceptional mechanical and electrical properties, positioning them as excellent channel materials for flexible electronics. However, conventional wet-transfer processes for integrating these materials onto flexible substrates often introduce surface contamination, significantly degrading device performance. Here, we present a wafer-scale dry-transfer technique using a high-dielectric oxide as the transfer medium, enabling the integration of 4-inch single-crystalline MoS$_2$ onto flexible substrates. This method eliminates contact with polymers or solvents, thus preserving the intrinsic electronic properties of MoS$_2$. As a result, the fabricated flexible field-effect transistor (FET) arrays exhibit remarkable performance, with a mobility of 117 cm$^2$/Vs, a subthreshold swing of 68.8 mV dec$^{-1}$, and an ultra-high current on/off ratio of $10^{12}$-values comparable to those achieved on rigid substrates. Leveraging the outstanding electrical characteristics, we demonstrated MoS$_2$-based flexible inverters operating in the subthreshold regime, achieving both a high gain of 218 and ultra-low power consumption of 1.4 pW/$\mu$m. Additionally, we integrated a flexible tactile sensing system driven by active-matrix MoS$_2$ FET arrays onto a robotic gripper, enabling real-time object identification. These findings demonstrate the simultaneous achievement of high electrical performance and flexibility, highlighting the immense potential of single-crystalline TMDC-based flexible electronics for real-world applications.

Title: Non-Hermitian global synchronization
Authors: Weixuan Zhang, Fengxiao Di, Xiangdong Zhang
Abstract: Synchronization of coupled nonlinear oscillators is a prevalent phenomenon in natural systems and can play important roles in various fields of modern science, such as laser arrays and electric networks. However, achieving robust global synchronization has always been a significant challenge due to its extreme susceptibility to initial conditions and structural perturbations. Here, we present a novel approach to achieve robust global synchronization by manipulating the interplay between non-Hermitian physics and nonlinear dynamics. Remarkably, the initial-state-independent non-Hermitian skin and topological global synchronization are proposed, exhibiting diverse anomalous effects such as the enlarged-size triggered non-Hermitian global synchronization and nonlinear skin states-dominated global synchronization. To validate our findings, we design and fabricate nonlinear topoelectrical circuits for experimental observation of non-Hermitian global synchronization. Our work opens up a promising avenue for establishing resilient global synchronization with potential applications in constructing high-radiance laser arrays and topologically synchronized networks.

Title: A Classifying Space for Phases of Matrix Product States
Authors: Agnes Beaudry, Michael Hermele, Markus J. Pflaum, Marvin Qi, Daniel D. Spiegel, David T. Stephen
Abstract: We construct a topological space $\mathcal{B}$ consisting of translation invariant injective matrix product states (MPS) of all physical and bond dimensions and show that it has the weak homotopy type $K(\mathbb{Z}, 2) \times K(\mathbb{Z}, 3)$. The implication is that the phase of a family of such states parametrized by a space $X$ is completely determined by two invariants: a class in $H^2(X; \mathbb{Z})$ corresponding to the Chern number per unit cell and a class in $H^3(X; \mathbb{Z})$, the so-called Kapustin-Spodyneiko (KS) number. The space $\mathcal{B}$ is defined as the quotient of a contractible space $\mathcal{E}$ of MPS tensors by an equivalence relation describing gauge transformations of the tensors. We prove that the projection map $p:\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ is a quasifibration, and this allows us to determine the weak homotopy type of $\mathcal{B}$. As an example, we review the Chern number pump-a family of MPS parametrized by $S^3$-and prove that it generates $\pi_3(\mathcal{B})$.

Title: Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics
Authors: Satori Tsuzuki
Abstract: Recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 have provided a multiscale physics perspective based on Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between scale transformation by filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We consider that the spin angle momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. We demonstrate that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the fluctuations at the microscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the fluctuations at the microscopic scale. In particular, the fluctuations can be reproduced at more macroscopic scales and amplified according to the size of kernel radius. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of cryogenic liquid helium4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity. In conclusion, we provide a new multiscale physical framework for cryogenic liquid helium-4.

Title: Bipolar Thermoelectric Josephson Engine
Authors: Gaia Germanese, Federico Paolucci, Giampiero Marchegiani, Alessandro Braggio, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: Thermoelectric effects in metals are typically small due to the nearly-perfect particle-hole (PH) symmetry around their Fermi surface [1, 2]. Despite being initially considered paradoxical [3], thermophase effects [4-8] and linear thermoelectricity [9] in superconducting systems were identified only when PH symmetry is explicitly broken [10-14]. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that a superconducting tunnel junction can develop a very large bipolar thermoelectric effect in the presence of a nonlinear thermal gradient thanks to spontaneous PH symmetry breaking [15]. Our junctions show a maximum thermovoltage of $\pm150\; \mu$ V at $\pm650$ mK, directly proportional to the superconducting gap. Notably, the corresponding Seebeck coefficient of $\pm300\; \mu$V/K is roughly $10^5$ times larger than the one expected for a normal metal at the same temperature [16, 17]. Moreover, by integrating our junctions into a Josephson interferometer, we realize a bipolar thermoelectric Josephson engine (BTJE) [18] with phase-coherent thermopower control [19]. When connected to a generic load, the BTJE generates a phase-tunable electric power up to about 140 mW/m$^2$ at subKelvin temperatures. In addition, our device implements the prototype for a persistent thermoelectric memory cell, written or erased by current injection [20]. We expect that our findings will trigger thermoelectricity in PH symmetric systems, and will lead to a number of groundbreaking applications in superconducting electronics [21], cutting-edge quantum technologies [22-24] and sensing [25].

Title: Superconductivity above 30 K due to the introduction of oxygen in CaFeAsF
Authors: Yixin Liu, Teng Wang, Zulei Xu, Da Jiang, Yi Zhao, Yanpeng Qi, Xiaoni Wang, Ming Yang, Mao Ye, Wei Peng, Gang Mu
Abstract: Exploring new unconventional superconductors is of great value for both fundamental research and practical applications. It is a long-term challenge to develop and study more hole-doped superconductors in 1111 system of iron-based superconductors. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity with a critical transition temperature up to 30.7 K in the compound CaFeAsF by a post-annealing treatment in air atmosphere. The superconducting behaviors are verified in both the single-crystalline and polycrystalline samples by the resistance and magnetization measurements. The analysis by combining the depth-resolved time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements shows that the introduction of oxygen elements and the consequent changing in Fe valence by the annealing treatment may lead to the hole-type doping, which is the origin for the occurrence of superconductivity. Our results pave the way for further in-depth investigations on the hole-doped 1111 system in iron-based superconductors.

Title: Wigner representation of Andreev-reflected charge pulses
Authors: Benjamin Roussel, Pablo Burset, Christian Flindt
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that the edge states of a quantum Hall sample can be coupled to a superconductor, so that incoming electrons in the edge states can be Andreev converted by the superconductor as coherent superpositions of an electron and a hole. In parallel, single-electron emitters that operate in the gigahertz regime have been realized on quantum Hall edge states. Motivated by this remarkable experimental progress, we here analyze the Andreev reflections of incoming charge pulses on the interface with a superconductor. To this end, we employ a Wigner function representation that allows us to visualize the response function of the interface both in the time and in the frequency domain. We analyze the response of an interface between a normal-metal and a singlet or triplet superconductor with and without an insulating barrier in between them. As a special case, we analyze the Andreev reflections of clean single-particle excitations that are generated by the application of lorentzian-shaped voltage pulses to the contacts of the inputs. Our predictions may be tested in future experiments with edge states coupled to superconductors.

Title: Orbital-Selective Spin-Triplet Superconductivity in Infinite-Layer LaNiO$_{2}$
Authors: Fabian Jakubczyk, Armando Consiglio, Domenico Di Sante, Ronny Thomale, Carsten Timm
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates has ignited stark interest within the scientific community, particularly regarding its likely unconventional origin. Conflicting magnetotransport measurements report either isotropic or anisotropic suppression of superconductivity in an external magnetic field, with distinct implications for the nature of superconducting order. In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons. Our findings not only shed light on the distinctiveness of LaNiO$_{2}$ as compared to cuprate superconductors or nickelates of different rare-earth composition but also suggest similarities to other candidate odd-parity superconductors.

Title: Open reaction-diffusion systems: bridging probabilistic theory and simulations across scales
Authors: Mauricio J. del Razo, Margarita Kostré
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying number of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. Using these mathematical bridges across scales, we finally develop numerical schemes for open reaction-diffusion systems, which we implement in two illustrative examples. This work establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.

Title: Nano-welding of quantum spin-$1/2$ chains at minimal dissipation
Authors: Moallison F. Cavalcante, Marcus V. S. Bonança, Eduardo Miranda, Sebastian Deffner
Abstract: We consider the optimal control of switching on a coupling term between two quantum many-body systems. Specifically, we (i) quantify the energetic cost of establishing a weak junction between two quantum spin-$1/2$ chains in finite time $\tau$ and (ii) identify the energetically optimal protocol to realize it. For linear driving protocols, we find that for long times the excess (irreversible) work scales as $\tau^{-\eta}$, where $\eta=1, 2$ or a nonuniversal number depending on the phase of the chains. Interestingly, increasing a $J_z$ anisotropy in the chains suppresses the excess work thus promoting quasi-adiabaticity. The general optimal control problem is solved, employing a Chebyshev ansatz. We find that the optimal control protocol is intimately sensitive to the chain phases.

Title: Electric field manipulation of magnetization in an insulating dilute ferromagnet through piezoelectromagnetic coupling
Authors: D. Sztenkiel, K. Gas, N. Gonzalez Szwacki, M. Foltyn, C. Sliwa, T. Wojciechowski, J. Z. Domagala, D. Hommel, M. Sawicki, T. Dietl
Abstract: We report magnetization changes generated by an electric field in ferromagnetic Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Two classes of phenomena have been revealed. First, over a wide range of magnetic fields, the magnetoelectric signal is odd in the electric field and reversible. Employing a macroscopic spin model and atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert theory with Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate that the magnetoelectric response results from the inverse piezoelectric effect that changes the trigonal single-ion magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Second, in the metastable regime of ferromagnetic hystereses, the magnetoelectric effect becomes non-linear and irreversible in response to a time-dependent electric field, which can reorient the magnetization direction. Interestingly, our observations are similar to those reported for another dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor Cr$_x$(Bi$_{1-y}$Sb$_y$)$_{1-x}$Te$_3$, in which magnetization was monitored as a function of the gate electric field. Those results constitute experimental support for theories describing the effects of time-dependent perturbation upon glasses far from thermal equilibrium in terms of an enhanced effective temperature.

Title: Electric-field switchable chirality in rhombohedral graphene Chern insulators stabilized by tungsten diselenide
Authors: Jing Ding, Hanxiao Xiang, Jiannan Hua, Wenqiang Zhou, Naitian Liu, Le Zhang, Na Xin, Bing Wu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Zdenek Sofer, Wei Zhu, Shuigang Xu
Abstract: Chern insulators host topologically protected chiral edge currents with quantized conductance characterized by their Chern number. Switching the chirality of a Chern insulator, namely, the direction of the edge current, is highly challenging due to topologically forbidden backscattering but is of considerable importance for the design of topological devices. Nevertheless, this can be achieved by reversing the sign of the Chern number through a topological phase transition. Here, we report electrically switchable chirality in rhombohedral multilayer graphene-based Chern insulators. By introducing moire superlattices in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene, we observed a cascade of topological phase transitions at quarter electron filling of a moire band with the Chern number tunable from -1, 1 to 2. Furthermore, integrating monolayer tungsten diselenide at the moireless interface of rhombohedral decalayer graphene/h-BN superlattices stabilizes the Chern insulators, enabling quantized anomalous Hall resistance of h/2e^2. Remarkably, the Chern number can be switched from -1 to 2 using displacement fields. Our work establishes rhombohedral multilayer graphene moire superlattices as a versatile platform for topological engineering, with switchable chirality offering significant promise for integrating chiral edge currents into topological electronic circuits.

Title: Adaptive energy reference for machine-learning models of the electronic density of states
Authors: Wei Bin How, Sanggyu Chong, Federico Grasselli, Kevin K. Huguenin-Dumittan, Michele Ceriotti
Abstract: The electronic density of states (DOS) provides information regarding the distribution of electronic energy levels in a material, and can be used to approximate its optical and electronic properties and therefore guide computational material design. Given its usefulness and relative simplicity, it has been one of the first electronic properties used as target for machine-learning approaches going beyond interatomic potentials. A subtle but important point, well-appreciated in the condensed matter community but usually overlooked in the construction of data-driven models, is that for bulk configurations the absolute energy reference of single-particle energy levels is ill-defined. Only energy differences matter, and quantities derived from the DOS are typically independent on the absolute alignment. We introduce an adaptive scheme that optimizes the energy reference of each structure as part of the training process, and show that it consistently improves the quality of ML models compared to traditional choices of energy reference, for different classes of materials and different model architectures. On a practical level, we trace the improved performance to the ability of this self-aligning scheme to match the most prominent features in the DOS. More broadly, we believe that this work highlights the importance of incorporating insights into the nature of the physical target into the definition of the architecture and of the appropriate figures of merit for machine-learning models, that translate in better transferability and overall performance.

Title: Elastic softness of low-symmetry frustrated $A$Ti$_2$O$_5$ ($A$ = Co, Fe)
Authors: Tadataka Watanabe, Kazuya Takayanagi, Ray Nishimura, Yoshiaki Hara, Dharmalingam Prabhakaran, Roger D. Johnson, Stephen J. Blundell
Abstract: Orthorhombic pseudobrookites CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ have a low-symmetry crystal structure comprising magnetic Co$^{2+}$/Fe$^{2+}$ ions and nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ ions, where the orbital-nondegenerate Co$^{2+}$/Fe$^{2+}$ ions form one-dimensional chains running along the orthorhombic $a$ axis. These compounds undergo an antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N \sim$ 26 K for CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and $T_N \sim$ 40 K for FeTi$_2$O$_5$. Ultrasound velocity measurements on single crystals of CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ reveal that CoTi$_2$O$_5$ exhibits unusual elastic softness above $T_N$ in the symmetry-lowering elastic mode of $ac$-plane shear elastic modulus, inconsistent with the structural symmetry breaking caused by antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N$. This suggests the presence of two distinct types of magnetostructural fluctuations above $T_N$ that should be a precursor to the symmetry-lowering lattice distortion at $T_N$. In contrast, FeTi$_2$O$_5$ exhibits either negligible or smaller elastic softness, indicating weaker spin-lattice coupling. These findings highlight CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ as unique spin-latticed-coupled frustrated systems with low crystal symmetry, where, while the exchange interactions are quasi-one-dimensional in nature, the frustration is released by further lowering the crystal symmetry through three-dimensional spin-lattice coupling, which is stronger in CoTi$_2$O$_5$ than in FeTi$_2$O$_5$.

Title: An NV- center in magnesium oxide as a spin qubit for hybrid quantum technologies
Authors: Vrindaa Somjit, Joel Davidsson, Yu Jin, Giulia Galli
Abstract: Recent predictions suggest that oxides, such as MgO and CaO, could serve as hosts of spin defects with long coherence times and thus be promising materials for quantum applications. However, in most cases specific defects have not yet been identified. Here, by using a high-throughput first-principles framework and advanced electronic structure methods, we identify a negatively-charged complex between a nitrogen interstitial and a magnesium vacancy in MgO with favorable electronic and optical properties for hybrid quantum technologies. We show that this NV- center has stable triplet ground and excited states, with singlet shelving states enabling optical initialization and spin-dependent readout. We predict several properties, including absorption, emission, and zero-phonon line energies, as well as zero-field splitting tensor, and hyperfine interaction parameters, which can aid in the experimental identification of this defect. Our calculations show that due to a strong pseudo-Jahn Teller effect and low frequency phonon modes, the NV- center in MgO is subject to a substantial vibronic coupling. We discuss design strategies to reduce such coupling and increase the Debye-Waller factor, including the effect of strain and the localization of the defect states. We propose that the favorable properties of the NV- defect, along with the technological maturity of MgO, could enable hybrid classical-quantum applications, such as spintronic quantum sensors and single qubit gates.

Title: Internal tensorial variables and a heat transport equation with inertial, thermal viscosity and vorticity terms
Authors: Liliana Restuccia, David Jou, Michal Pavelka
Abstract: Phonon hydrodynamics describes the motions of heat carriers (phonons) at sub-continuum scales: diffusive, ballistic, viscous, and vortical. In a previous paper, these behaviours were investigated within the framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics with internal variables at the macroscopic scale, deriving generalizations of the Guyer-Krumhansl equation. In particular, a generalized heat conduction equation, containing not only the Fourier, Maxwell-Vernotte-Cattaneo, and Guyer-Krumhansl contributions, but also a term describing phonon vortices, was obtained. In this paper, we provide new insight and clarifications into the same model for rigid heat-conducting media. Then, we a posteriori identify two non-local macroscopic internal variables, $Q^s$ and $Q^a$ (the symmetric part and the antisymmetric part of a second order tensor $Q$) with the symmetric (changed in sign) and antisymmetric gradients of the heat flux, $-(\nabla J(q))^s$ and $(\nabla J(q))^{a}$. Also an identification of these two tensorial internal variables is obtained by an asymptotic approach. This generalizes the heat equation with additional terms containing the time derivative of the heat flux describing the viscous and vortical motions of phonons. These terms may describe the transfer from ordered rotational motion of phonon vortices to rotational microscopic motions of diatomic particles constituting complex polar crystals, in analogy to the hydrodynamics of classical micropolar fluids. Therefore, this paper fits into the currently explored area of phonon vorticity and its interactions with the heat flux itself.

Title: Low temperature state in strontium titanate microcrystals using in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging
Authors: David Yang, Ana F. Suzana, Longlong Wu, Sung Soo Ha, Sungwook Choi, Hieu Minh Ngo, Muhammad Mahmood Nawaz, Hyunjung Kim, Jialun Liu, Daniel Treuherz, Nan Zhang, Zheyi An, Gareth Nisbet, Daniel G. Porter, Ian K. Robinson
Abstract: Strontium titanate is a classic quantum paraelectric oxide material that has been widely studied in bulk and thin films. It exhibits a well-known cubic-to-tetragonal antiferrodistortive phase transition at 105 K, characterized by the rotation of oxygen octahedra. A possible second phase transition at lower temperature is suppressed by quantum fluctuations, preventing the onset of ferroelectric order. However, recent studies have shown that ferroelectric order can be established at low temperatures by inducing strain and other means. Here, we used in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent x-ray diffraction imaging to measure the strain and rotation tensors for two strontium titanate microcrystals at low temperature. We observe strains induced by dislocations and inclusion-like impurities in the microcrystals. Based on radial magnitude plots, these strains increase in magnitude and spread as the temperature decreases. Pearson's correlation heat maps show a structural transition at 50 K, which could possibly be the formation of a low-temperature ferroelectric phase in the presence of strain. We do not observe any change in local strains associated with the tetragonal phase transition at 105 K.

Title: Realizing tunable Fermi level in SnTe by defect control
Authors: Bamidele Oluwagbenga Onipede, Matthew Metcalf, Nisha Fletcher, Hui Cai
Abstract: The tuning of the Fermi level in tin telluride, a topological crystalline insulator, is essential for accessing its unique surface states and optimizing its electronic properties for applications such as spintronics and quantum computing. In this study, we demonstrate that the Fermi level in tin telluride can be effectively modulated by controlling the tin concentration during chemical vapor deposition synthesis. By introducing tin-rich conditions, we observed a blue shift in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy core-level peaks of both tin and tellurium, indicating an upward shift in the Fermi level. This shift is corroborated by a decrease in work function values measured via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, confirming the suppression of Sn vacancies. Our findings provide a low-cost, scalable method to achieve tunable Fermi levels in tin telluride, offering a significant advancement in the development of materials with tailored electronic properties for next-generation technological applications.

Title: Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians via Tensor Hypercontraction
Authors: Yu Wang, Maxine Luo, Matthias Reumann, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only 2. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.

Title: Giant Strain Tunability in Polycrystalline Ceramic Films via Helium Implantation
Authors: A. Blàzquez Martínez, S. Glinšek, T. Granzow, J.-N. Audinot, P. Fertey, J. Kreisel, M. Guennou, C. Toulouse
Abstract: Strain engineering is a powerful tool routinely used to control and enhance properties such as ferroelectricity, magnetic ordering, or metal-insulator transitions. Epitaxial strain in thin films allows manipulation of in-plane lattice parameters, achieving strain values generally up to 4%, and above in some specific cases. In polycrystalline films, which are more suitable for functional applications due to their lower fabrication costs, strains above 1% often cause cracking. This poses challenges for functional property tuning by strain engineering. Helium implantation has been shown to induce negative pressure through interstitial implantation, which increases the unit cell volume and allows for continuous strain tuning with the implanted dose in epitaxial monocrystalline films. However, there have been no studies on the transferability of helium implantation as a strain-engineering technique to polycrystalline films. Here, we demonstrate the technique's applicability for strain engineering beyond epitaxial monocrystalline samples. Helium implantation can trigger an unprecedented lattice parameter expansion of up to 3.2% in polycrystalline BiFeO3 films without causing structural cracks. The film maintains stable ferroelectric properties with doses up to 1E15 He/cm2. This finding underscores the potential of helium implantation in strain engineering polycrystalline materials, enabling cost-effective and versatile applications.

Title: Topological edge flows drive macroscopic re-organization in magnetic colloids
Authors: Aleksandra Nelson, Dana M. Lobmeyer, Sibani L. Biswal, Evelyn Tang
Abstract: Magnetic colloids can be driven with time-varying fields to form clusters and voids that re-organize over vastly different timescales. However, the driving force behind these non-equilibrium dynamics is not well-understood. Here, we introduce a topological framework that predicts protected edge flows despite strong thermal motion. Notably, these edge flows produce shear stress that creates global rotation of clusters but not of voids. We verify this theory experimentally using micron-sized super-paramagnetic colloids to demonstrate these emergent physical predictions and show how they drive system re-organization differentially at long timescales. Our results elucidate fundamental principles that shape and control non-equilibrium colloidal aggregates.

Title: A note on the deformation of 1D ferromagnetic domain walls due to double exchange interaction with a free electron gas
Authors: K. Seremetas, X. Zotos
Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the thermodynamic potential and conductance of a Bloch or Néel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron gas via a double exchange interaction. The minimization of the elastic magnetic energy plus electronic thermodynamic potential indicates that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is generally deformed to a thin wall, while for magnetic interaction larger than the chemical potential tends towards wide walls. In contrast, for a double wall configuration the deformation is always towards wide walls. For the single as well as the double magnetic wall configurations the conductance monotonically decreases with decreasing wall width. The thermodynamic potential and conductance of Bloch and Néel magnetic domain walls are identical within this prototype model.

Title: Rydberg excitons and polaritons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides in a magnetic field
Authors: D. de la Fuente Pico, J. Levinsen, E. Laird, M. M. Parish, F. M. Marchetti
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory for excitons and cavity exciton polaritons in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers under a perpendicular static magnetic field. We obtain numerically exact solutions for the ground and excited states, accounting for the interplay between arbitrarily large magnetic fields and light-matter coupling strengths. This includes the very strong coupling regime, where light-induced modifications of the exciton wavefunction become essential and the approximate coupled oscillator description breaks down. Our results show excellent agreement with recent experimental measurements of the diamagnetic shift of the ground and excited exciton states in WS$_2$, MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoTe$_2$ monolayers. For polaritons, we consider experimentally relevant system parameters and demonstrate that the diamagnetic shifts of both the ground and excited states at high magnetic fields exhibit clear signatures of the very strong coupling regime, highlighting the necessity of our microscopic and numerically exact treatment over perturbative approaches. Furthermore, our microscopic approach allows us to evaluate the exciton-exciton and polariton-polariton interaction strengths. Comparing results specific to TMD monolayers with those applicable to quantum wells, we find that variational approaches overestimate the TMD excitons' interaction strength. We also observe that magnetic fields weaken the interaction strength for both excitons and polaritons, with a less pronounced effect in TMDs than in quantum wells, and that light-induced modifications to the matter component in TMD polaritons can enhance interaction strengths beyond those of purely excitonic interactions.

Title: Quantum dynamics in symmetry-breaking ordered phases of correlated fermions
Authors: Václav Janiš, Mukesh Khanore
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking phases of many-fermion systems are characterized by anomalous functions representing transient processes during which some characteristics of free particles, such as spin or charge, are not conserved. Matching the low-temperature symmetry-breaking phase with the high-temperature one consistently with nontrivial quantum dynamics is a long-standing, unresolved problem. We argue that the two-particle propagators may contain only even powers of the anomalous Green functions to make the thermodynamic system conserving. Only then can we continuously match the symmetry-breaking phase with the normal one at the single transition point. We use the antiferromagnetic phase of a dynamical mean-field approximation to disclose universal features of the impact of quantum dynamics on the thermodynamic and spectral properties of the ordered state.

Title: Exploiting the Hermitian symmetry in tensor network algorithms
Authors: Oscar van Alphen, Stijn V. Kleijweg, Juraj Hasik, Philippe Corboz
Abstract: Exploiting symmetries in tensor network algorithms plays a key role for reducing the computational and memory costs. Here we explain how to incorporate the Hermitian symmetry in double-layer tensor networks, which naturally arise in methods based on projected entangled-pair states (PEPS). For real-valued tensors the Hermitian symmetry defines a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry on the combined bra and ket auxiliary level of the tensors. By implementing this symmetry, a speedup of the computation time by up to a factor 4 can be achieved, while expectation values of observables and reduced density matrices remain Hermitian by construction. Benchmark results based on the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) and higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG) are presented. We also discuss how to implement the Hermitian symmetry in the complex case, where a similar speedup can be achieved.

Title: Simultaneous Topology Optimization of Differentiable and Non-Differentiable Objectives via Morphology Learning: Stiffness and Cell Growth on Scaffold
Authors: Weiming Wang, Yanhao Hou, Renbo Su, Weiguang Wang, Charlie C.L. Wang
Abstract: Topology optimization of microstructures plays a critical role in optimizing functional performance across diverse engineering applications. While metamaterials with enhanced mechanical properties -- such as hyperelasticity, energy absorption, and thermal efficiency -- are commonly designed using complex microstructural geometries and multi-physics simulations, achieving the simultaneous optimization of mechanical performance and non-differentiable objectives remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel framework for simultaneous topology optimization of differentiable and non-differentiable objectives via a data-driven morphology learning approach. The framework extracts shape patterns from a curated dataset of microstructures recognized for their superior performance in specific functional applications. To showcase the versatility of the approach, we apply it to the optimization of scaffolds for bone tissue engineering, with cell growth as a representative functional objective. By integrating learned morphology patterns into a topology optimization process, the method generates microstructures that effectively balance mechanical stiffness and biological performance, such as enhanced cell proliferation. As a case study, we demonstrate a scaffold design that improves mechanical stiffness by 29.69% and cell growth by 37.05% on Day 7 and 33.30% on Day 14. This approach highlights the general applicability of the proposed framework for optimizing a broad range of engineering challenges, beyond the specific case of cell growth.

Title: Origin of Anomalous Hall effect in Cr-doped RuO$_2$
Authors: Andriy Smolyanyuk, Libor Šmejkal, Igor I. Mazin
Abstract: RuO$_2$ is one of the most highlighted candidates for altermagnetism. However, the most recent muon spin spectroscopy and neutron studies demonstrated the absence of magnetic order in this system. The electronic structure of RuO$_2$ hints at a possibility of realizing a magnetically ordered state upon hole doping, and such a possibility was explored experimentally in Cr-doped RuO$_2$, where it was suggested that this system exhibits the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) due to altermagnetism. In this manuscript, based on our density functional calculations, we revise the results obtained for this system and propose a different interpretation of experimental results. Our calculations suggest that extra holes are bound to Cr impurity and do not dope Ru bands, which remain nonmagnetic. Thus, the observed AHE is not due to the altermagnetism but stems entirely from magnetic Cr ions.

Title: Information system for analysis of nanostructure morphology: Education and research
Authors: Ludia T. Khusainova, Konstantin S. Kolegov
Abstract: The work is devoted to the development of an information system ISANM that will be useful for teaching students and applicable in the work of engineers and researchers for automating the analysis of colloidal structure morphology. The ISANM system integrates various analysis methods and is designed prioritize usability, catering primarily to users rather than software developers. This paper outlines the scope of the subject area, reviews selected methods for morphology analysis, and presents the scripts developed for implementing these methods in Python. In the future, new methods and tools will be gradually added to the system for chemical engineers, physicists, and materials scientists. We hope that the system implementation methodology described here will be useful in the implementation of other projects related to training chemical engineers and beyond. The system core is implemented in C#, utilizing the .NET Framework and the MS SQL Server, and is developed within the Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 environment on Windows 10 using the client-server architecture. The system has been deployed on a VDS server using the Ubuntu 20.04 distribution. MS SQL Server is used as the database management system. The system can be accessed at this https URL. Geometric analysis of colloidal structures is significant in applications such as photonic crystals for optoelectronics and microelectronics, functional coatings in materials science, and biosensors for medical and environmental applications. This demonstrates the importance of digitalization in this area to improve the quality of student education.

Title: Long-time divergences in the nonlinear response of gapped one-dimensional many-particle systems
Authors: M. Fava, S. Gopalakrishnan, R. Vasseur, S. A. Parameswaran, F. H. L. Essler
Abstract: We consider one dimensional many-particle systems that exhibit kinematically protected single-particle excitations over their ground states. We show that momentum and time-resolved 4-point functions of operators that create such excitations diverge linearly in particular time differences. This behaviour can be understood by means of a simple semiclassical analysis based on the kinematics and scattering of wave packets of quasiparticles. We verify that our wave packet analysis correctly predicts the long-time limit of the four-point function in the transverse field Ising model through a form factor expansion. We present evidence in favour of the same behaviour in integrable quantum field theories. In addition, we extend our discussion to experimental protocols where two times of the four-point function coincide, e.g. 2D coherent spectroscopy and pump-probe experiments. Finally, focusing on the Ising model, we discuss subleading corrections that grow as the square root of time differences. We show that the subleading corrections can be correctly accounted for by the same semiclassical analysis, but also taking into account wave packet spreading.

Title: Spin Liquid Landscapes in the Kagome Lattice: A Variational Monte Carlo Study of the Chiral Heisenberg Model and Experimental Signatures
Authors: Hee Seung Kim, Hyeok-Jun Yang, Karlo Penc, SungBin Lee
Abstract: Chiral spin liquids (CSL), which break time-reversal symmetry, are of great interest due to their topological properties and fractionalized excitations (anyons). In this work, we investigate CSL on the kagome lattice arising from the competition between the third-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg interaction across hexagons ($J_d$) and a staggered scalar spin chirality term ($J_\chi$). Using variational Monte Carlo methods, we map out the phase diagram and identify various gapped and gapless CSL phases, each characterized by a distinct flux pattern. Notably, the interplay between $J_d$ and $J_\chi$ induces a tricritical point, which we analyze using Landau-Ginzburg theory. Additionally, we identify potential signatures of these CSLs-including distinctive spin-spin correlations, anomalies in the static spin structure factor, longitudinal thermal conductivity, and magnetoelectric effects-which offer practical guidance for their future experimental detection.

Title: Spin excitations arising from anisotropic Dirac spinons in YCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{0.33}$(OD)$_{0.67}$]
Authors: Lankun Han, Zhenyuan Zeng, Chengkang Zhou, Bo Liu, Maiko Kofu, Kenji Nakajima, Paul Steffens, Arno Hiess, Zi Yang Meng, Yixi Su, Shiliang Li
Abstract: A Dirac quantum spin liquid hosts Dirac spinons, which are low-energy fractionalized neutral quasiparticles with spin 1/2 that obey the Dirac equation. Recent inelastic neutron scattering studies have revealed cone spin continuum in YCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{x}$(OD)$_{1-x}$], consistent with the convolution of two Dirac spinons. In this work, we further studied spin excitations using the inelastic neutron scattering technique. The width of low-energy spin excitations shows a linear temperature dependence, which can be explained by spinon-spinon interactions with a Dirac dispersion. Polarized neutron scattering measurements reveal that in-plane magnetic fluctuations are about 1.5 times stronger than the out-of-plane ones, suggesting the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and consistent with our theoretical modeling and simulations. Moreover, the high-energy spin excitations around 14 meV agree with the one-pair spinon-antispinon excitations in Raman studies. The real part of the dynamical susceptibility derived from the Kramers-Kronig relationship also accords with the Knight shift measured by nuclear magnetic resonance, clearly demonstrating the negligible effects of magnetic impurities on static susceptibility. These results provide a rare example in studying quantum-spin-liquid materials where different experimental techniques can be directly compared and give further insights for the possible Dirac quantum spin liquid in this system.

Title: Gross-Neveu-Yukawa SO(2) and SO(3) tensorial criticality
Authors: SangEun Han, Shouryya Ray, Igor F. Herbut
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.

Title: Understanding the Growth and Properties of Sputter-Deposited Phase-Change Superlattice Films
Authors: Simone Prili, Valeria Bragaglia, Vara Prasad Jonnalagadda, Jesse Luchtenveld, Fabrizio Arciprete, Bart J. Kooi, Abu Sebastian, Ghazi Sarwat Syed
Abstract: Highly textured chalcogenide films have recently gained significant interest for phase-change memory applications. Several reports have highlighted that programming efficiency improves in devices featuring superlattice stacks, such as Ge2Sb2Te5/Sb2Te3. However, to be technologically relevant, these films must be deposited on foundry-scale wafers using processes compatible with back end of the line (BEOL) integration and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as, for example, sputter deposition. In this work, we present our observations on the influence of temperature, pressure, and seeding layer parameters on the sputter growth processes of superlattice films. By measuring various material properties, we construct a pseudo-phase diagram to illustrate the growth of both individual and superlattice films with different periodicities on technologically relevant substrates, namely SiO2 and carbon. These results provide important insights into the structure, intermixing and electro-optical properties of superlattice films,

Title: Ternary Stochastic Neuron -- Implemented with a Single Strained Magnetostrictive Nanomagnet
Authors: Rahnuma Rahman, Supriyo Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: Stochastic neurons are extremely efficient hardware for solving a large class of problems and usually come in two varieties -- "binary" where the neuronal statevaries randomly between two values of -1, +1 and "analog" where the neuronal state can randomly assume any value between -1 and +1. Both have their uses in neuromorphic computing and both can be implemented with low- or zero-energy-barrier nanomagnets whose random magnetization orientations in the presence of thermal noise encode the binary or analog state variables. In between these two classes is n-ary stochastic neurons, mainly ternary stochastic neurons (TSN) whose state randomly assumes one of three values (-1, 0, +1), which have proved to be efficient in pattern classification tasks such as recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST data set or patterns from the CIFAR-10 data set. Here, we show how to implement a TSN with a zero-energy-barrier (shape isotropic) magnetostrictive nanomagnet subjected to uniaxial strain.

Title: Nonlinear Hall Effect in Two-dimensional Materials
Authors: Shuo Wang, Wei Niu, Yue-Wen Fang
Abstract: Symmetry is a cornerstone of condensed matter physics, fundamentally shaping the behavior of electronic systems and inducing the emergence of novel phenomena. The Hall effect, a key concept in this field, demonstrates how symmetry breaking, particularly of time-reversal symmetry, influences electronic transport properties. Recently, the nonlinear Hall effect has extended this understanding by generating a transverse voltage that modulates at twice the frequency of the driving alternating current without breaking time-reversal symmetry. This effect is closely tied to the symmetry and quantum geometric properties of materials, offering a new approach to probing the Berry curvature and quantum metric. Here, we provide a review of the theoretical insights and experimental advancements in the nonlinear Hall effect, particularly focusing on its realization in two-dimensional materials. We discuss the challenges still ahead, look at potential applications for devices, and explore how these ideas might apply to other nonlinear transport phenomena. By elucidating these aspects, this review aims to advance the understanding of nonlinear transport effects and their broader implications for future technologies.

Title: Relaxation behavior near the first-order phase transition line
Authors: Xiaobing Li, Ranran Guo, Mingmei Xu, Jinghua Fu, Lizhu Chen, Yu Zhou, Yuanfang Wu
Abstract: Using the Metropolis algorithm, we simulate the relaxation process of the three-dimensional kinetic Ising model. Starting from a random initial configuration, we first present the average equilibration time across the entire phase boundary. It is observed that the average equilibration time increases significantly as the temperature decreases far from the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$. The average equilibration time along the first-order phase transition (1st-PT) line exhibits an ultra-slow relaxation. We also investigate the dynamic scaling behavior with system sizes, and find that dynamic scaling holds not only near $T_{\rm c}$, but also at $T\ll T_{\rm c}$. The dynamic exponent at $T\ll T_{\rm c}$ is larger than that near $T_{\rm c}$. Additionally, we analyze the dynamic scaling of the average autocorrelation time and find that it depends on system size only near $T_{\rm c}$, while it becomes size-independent both above and below $T_{\rm c}$. The extremely slow relaxation dynamics observed near the 1st-PT is attributed to the complex structure of the free energy.

Title: Deeper insight into the terahertz response of conventional superconductors under magnetic field
Authors: Michal Šindler, František Herman, Filip Kadlec, Christelle Kadlec
Abstract: We investigate the terahertz conductivity of conventional superconductors in Voigt and Faraday magneto-optical configurations. First, we review theoretical approaches describing the fundamental processes of suppression of superconductivity in magnetic field and how the in-gap states are filled. In the Voigt geometry, thin superconducting films are fully penetrated by the magnetic field which interacts with the spin, thus modifying the magnitudes of the optical gap and of the density of the condensate. In this configuration, we provide an alternative description of the recent experiments showing the gapless conductivity of a Nb film measured by Lee ${\it et\,al.}$ [Nat. Commun. 14,2737 (2023)], which better fits their data for magnetic fields above 1 T. In the Faraday geometry, we measured and analyzed the terahertz conductivity of three NbN films with varying thicknesses using the Maxwell-Garnett model, treating vortices as normal-state inclusions within a superconducting matrix. In both geometries, the optical conductivity can be comprehensively described by the model of Herman and Hlubina [Phys. Rev. B 96, 014509 (2017)] involving pair-conserving, and magnetic-field-dependent pair-breaking disorder scattering processes.

Title: Taxonomy of amorphous ternary phase diagrams: the importance of interaction parameters
Authors: Yasin Ameslon, Hao Liu, Jens Harting, Olivier J.J. Ronsin, Olga Wodo
Abstract: Understanding phase diagrams is essential for material selection and design, as they provide a comprehensive representation of the thermodynamics of mixtures. This work delivers a broad and systematic overview of possible ternary phase diagrams for amorphous systems representative of polymers, small organic molecules, and solvents. Thanks to computationally efficient methods, an unprecedented library of $>$80,000 ternary phase diagrams is generated based on a systematic screening of interaction parameters. Twenty-one phase diagram types, including unreported ones, are identified. They are classified according to simple rules related to the number of immiscible material pairs, of miscibility gaps, and of three-phase regions. They are mapped onto the three-dimensional interaction parameters space, providing a clear picture of their likelihood and existence conditions. Four well-known phase-diagram types with 0, 1, 2, or 3 immiscible pairs are found to be the most likely. The numerous uncommon phase diagrams are mostly observed within a small parameter window around the critical interaction parameter values. For the most common phase diagram types, we show that the size of the processability window becomes sensitive to interaction parameter variations close to critical values. The sensitivity decreases for materials with increasing molar size. Finally, successful comparisons of simulated and experimental phase diagrams showcase the real-world relevance of this theoretical analysis. The presented results lay a robust foundation for rational design of solution processing conditions and for blend morphology control. Immediate applications include organic thin films and the identification of green solvents for sustainable processing.

Title: Spin-flip Scattering at a Chiral Interface of Helical Chains
Authors: Keita Matsubara, Kazumasa Hattori
Abstract: We investigate spin-flip scattering processes of electrons when they pass a chiral interface, which is the boundary between right- and left-handed one-dimensional chain. We construct a minimal $p$-orbital model consisting of the right- and left-handed one-dimensional threefold helical chains connected at $z=0$ with the nearest neighbor hopping and the spin-orbit coupling. The dynamics of spin-polarized wave packet passing through the interface, the Green's functions, and electronic states near the interface are analyzed numerically. We find that the microscopic structure of the interface is important and this strongly affects the local electronic orbital state. This in addition to the spin-orbit coupling determines whether the spin flip occurs or not at the chiral interface and suggests a possible spin transport control by the orbital configuration at the chiral interface.

Title: Properties of two level systems in current-carrying superconductors
Authors: T. Liu, A. V. Andreev, B. Z. Spivak
Abstract: We show that in disordered superconductors, at sufficiently low frequencies $\omega$, the coupling of TLS to external ac electric fields increases dramatically in the presence of a dc supercurrent. This giant enhancement manifests in all ac linear and nonlinear phenomena. In particular, it leads to a parametric enhancement of the real part of the ac conductivity and, consequently, of the equilibrium current fluctuations. If the distribution of TLS relaxation times is broad, the conductivity is inversely proportional to $\omega$, and the spectrum of the equilibrium current fluctuations takes the form of 1/f noise.

Title: Interactive Multiscale Modeling to Bridge Atomic Properties and Electrochemical Performance in Li-CO$_2$ Battery Design
Authors: Mohammed Lemaalem, Selva Chandrasekaran Selvaraj, Ilias Papailias, Naveen K. Dandu, Arash Namaeighasemi, Larry A. Curtiss, Amin Salehi-Khojin, Anh T. Ngo
Abstract: Li-CO$_2$ batteries show promise as energy storage solutions, offering high theoretical energy density and CO$_2$ fixation. Their performance relies on the formation and decomposition of Li$_2$CO$_3$/C during discharge and charge cycles, respectively. We used a multiscale modeling framework that integrates Density Functional Theory (DFT), Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD), classical Molecular Dynamics (MD), and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to investigate atomic and cell-level properties. The Li-CO$_2$ battery consists of a lithium metal anode, an ionic liquid electrolyte, and a carbon cloth porous cathode with a Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ catalyst. DFT and AIMD determined the electrical conductivities of Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ and Li$_2$CO$_3$ using the Kubo-Greenwood formalism and studied the CO$_2$ reduction mechanism on the cathode catalyst. MD simulations calculated the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient, Li$^+$ transference number, ionic conductivity, and Li$^+$ solvation structure. The FEA model, incorporating results from atomistic simulations, reproduced experimental voltage-capacity profiles at 1 mA/cm$^2$ and revealed spatio-temporal variations in Li$_2$CO$_3$/C deposition, porosity, and CO$_2$ concentration dependence on discharge rates in the cathode. Accordingly, Li$_2$CO$_3$ can form toroidal and thin film deposits, leading to dispersed and local porosity changes at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ and 1 mA/cm$^2$, respectively. The capacity decreases exponentially from 81,570 mAh/g at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ to 6,200 mAh/g at 1 mA/cm$^2$, due to pore clogging that limits CO$_2$ transport to the cathode interior. Therefore, the performance of Li-CO$_2$ batteries can be significantly improved by enhancing CO$_2$ transport, regulating Li$_2$CO$_3$ deposition, and optimizing cathode architecture.

Title: Structural and mechanical properties of W-Cu compounds characterized by a neural-network-based potential
Authors: Jianchuan Liu, Tao Chen, Sheng Mao, Mohan Chen
Abstract: Tungsten-copper (W-Cu) compounds are widely utilized in various industrial fields due to their exceptional mechanical properties. In this study, we have developed a neural-network-based deep potential (DP) model that covers a wide range of temperatures, ranging from 0 to 3,000 K, and pressures, varying from 0 to 10 GPa. This study presents a model trained using density functional theory data for full concentration CuxW100-x compounds. Through this model, we systematically investigate the structural and mechanical properties of W-Cu alloys and have the following findings. First, the bulk modulus (B) and Young's modulus (E) of W-Cu alloys exhibit a linear decline as the Cu content increases, indicating a softening trend in the CuxW100-x compounds as the Cu concentration rises. Second, a higher Cu content results in higher critical strain and lower critical stress for these compounds. A brittle-to-ductile transition in the deformation mode predicted is predicted at around 37.5 at. % Cu content. Third, tensile loading tests in the W-Cu gradient structure reveal that Cu-poor region serves as a barrier, hindering shear band propagation while promoting new shear band formation in the Cu-rich region. The above results from the DP model are anticipated to aid in exploring the physical mechanisms underlying the complex phenomena of W-Cu systems and contribute to the advancement of methodologies for materials simulation.

Title: Model for the commensurate charge-density waves in under-hole-doped cuprate superconductors
Authors: Jacob Morrissey, Timothy J.Haugan, Richard A. Klemm
Abstract: A simple model of the commensurate charge-density wave (CCDW) portion of the underdoped pseudogap regions of monolayer Bi$_2$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$CuO$_{6-x}$ (Bi2201), bilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi2212), and trilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ (Bi2223) cuprate superconductors is presented and studied. Above the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ but below the pseudogap transition temperature $T_p > T_c$, the CCDW forms on the oxygen sites in the CuO$_2$ layers with excess charges of $\pm\delta e$, where $e$ is the electronic charge, forming on alternating oxygen sites. This model is equivalent to $N$-layer versions of the two-dimensional Ising model for spins on a square lattice with repulsive interactions $J' , J>0$ between near-neighbor inter- and intralayer sites, respectively. For strong coupling, we show analytically for sections of $L\times M\times N$ sites that the partition function in the $J'\rightarrow\pm \infty$ limits reduces to that for an effective single layer with $L\times M$ sites and $J$ replaced by $NJ$. The CCDW is therefore strongly enhanced and stabilized by multilayer structures, likely accounting for the enhanced THz emission observed from the intrinsic Josephson junctions in underdoped Bi2212 mesas and for the many experiments on Bi2212 and related compounds purporting to provide evidence for a superconducting order parameter with $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry.

Title: Magnetic measurements under high pressure with a quantum sensor in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Lun-Xuan Yu, Nai-Jie Guo, Lin Liu, Wei Liu, Gui-Zhen Yan, Jin-Ming Cui, Jian-Shun Tang, Chuan-Feng Li, Xiao-Di Liu
Abstract: Magnetic measurements under high-pressure conditions are pivotal for the study of superconductivity and magnetic materials but remain challenging due to the micrometer-sized sample in diamond anvil cells (DAC). In this study, we propose a quantum sensing approach utilizing negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_B^-$) spin defects in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride for high resolution magnetic measurements under pressure. The optical and spin properties of VB$^-$ defects were systematically studied under high-pressure conditions, revealing a significant pressure-induced shift in zero-field splitting (ZFS), approximately three times larger than that of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. Furthermore, we demonstrate the pressure-dependent magnetic transition and variations in the Curie temperature of van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ flake using V$_B^-$ defects under pressures. Notably, the maximum operational pressure for V$_B^-$ defects was determined to be approximately 11 GPa, attributed to a structural phase transition in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). This work establishes the way for two-dimensional quantum sensing technologies under high-pressure environments.

Title: Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons
Authors: Zhiyuan Wang, Kaden R. A. Hazzard
Abstract: It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.

Title: Geometry of Classical Nambu-Goldstone Fields
Authors: Slobodan Radošević
Abstract: A coordinate-free formulation of first order effective field theory, in which Nambu-Goldstone fields are described as sections on associated bundle, is presented. This construction, which is based only on symmetry considerations, allows for a direct derivation of number and types of Nambu-Goldstone fields in a classical field theory without any reference to effective Lagrangian. A central role in classification is shown to be played by Lorentz-symmetry breaking order parameter which induces symplectic structure in the field space of the theory.

Title: Unifying Floquet theory of longitudinal and dispersive readout
Authors: Alessandro Chessari, Esteban A. Rodríguez-Mena, José Carlos Abadillo-Uriel, Victor Champain, Simon Zihlmann, Romain Maurand, Yann-Michel Niquet, Michele Filippone
Abstract: We devise a Floquet theory of longitudinal and dispersive readout in circuit QED. By studying qubits coupled to cavity photons and driven at the resonance frequency of the cavity $\omega_{\rm r}$, we establish a universal connection between the qubit AC Stark shift and the longitudinal and dispersive coupling to photons. We find that the longitudinal coupling $g_\parallel$ is controlled by the slope of the AC Stark shift as function of the driving strength $A_{\rm q}$, while the dispersive shift $\chi$ depends on its curvature. The two quantities become proportional to each other in the weak drive limit ($A_{\rm q}\rightarrow 0$). Our approach unifies the adiabatic limit ($\omega_{\rm r}\rightarrow 0$) -- where $g_\parallel$ is generated by the static spectrum curvature (or quantum capacitance) -- with the diabatic one, where the static spectrum plays no role. We derive analytical results supported by exact numerical simulations. We apply them to superconducting and spin-hybrid cQED systems, showcasing the flexibility of faster-than-dispersive longitudinal readout.

Title: Floquet Schrieffer-Wolff transform based on Sylvester equations
Authors: Xiao Wang, Fabio Pablo Miguel Méndez-Córdoba, Dieter Jaksch, Frank Schlawin
Abstract: We present a Floquet Schrieffer Wolff transform (FSWT) to obtain effective Floquet Hamiltonians and micro-motion operators of periodically driven many-body systems for any non-resonant driving frequency. The FSWT perturbatively eliminates the oscillatory components in the driven Hamiltonian by solving operator-valued Sylvester equations with systematic approximations. It goes beyond various high-frequency expansion methods commonly used in Floquet theory, as we demonstrate with the example of the driven Fermi-Hubbard model. In the limit of high driving frequencies, the FSWT Hamiltonian reduces to the widely used Floquet-Magnus result. We anticipate this method will be useful for designing Rydberg multi-qubit gates, controlling correlated hopping in quantum simulations in optical lattices, and describing multi-orbital and long-range interacting systems driven in-gap.

Title: Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Aiichi Iwazaki
Abstract: Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or lower and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz at a low temperature of 35 mK and with a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes, indicating the presence of axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. We also propose additional experiments that support the existence of axions. The appearance of the axion effect in the quantum Hall effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.

Title: Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge
Authors: Zhiyuan Wang
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.

Title: Emittance Minimization for Aberration Correction II: Physics-informed Bayesian Optimization of an Electron Microscope
Authors: Desheng Ma, Steven E. Zeltmann, Chenyu Zhang, Zhaslan Baraissov, Yu-Tsun Shao, Cameron Duncan, Jared Maxson, Auralee Edelen, David A. Muller
Abstract: Aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has become an essential tool in understanding materials at the atomic scale. However, tuning the aberration corrector to produce a sub-Ångström probe is a complex and time-costly procedure, largely due to the difficulty of precisely measuring the optical state of the system. When measurements are both costly and noisy, Bayesian methods provide rapid and efficient optimization. To this end, we develop a Bayesian approach to fully automate the process by minimizing a new quality metric, beam emittance, which is shown to be equivalent to performing aberration correction. In part I, we derived several important properties of the beam emittance metric and trained a deep neural network to predict beam emittance growth from a single Ronchigram. Here we use this as the black box function for Bayesian Optimization and demonstrate automated tuning of simulated and real electron microscopes. We explore different surrogate functions for the Bayesian optimizer and implement a deep neural network kernel to effectively learn the interactions between different control channels without the need to explicitly measure a full set of aberration coefficients. Both simulation and experimental results show the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches by achieving a better optical state with a higher convergence rate.

Abstract: Approximating the ground state of many-body systems is a key computational bottleneck underlying important applications in physics and chemistry. It has long been viewed as a promising application for quantum computers. The most widely known quantum algorithm for ground state approximation, quantum phase estimation, is out of reach of current quantum processors due to its high circuit-depths. Quantum diagonalization algorithms based on subspaces represent alternatives to phase estimation, which are feasible for pre-fault-tolerant and early-fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we introduce a quantum diagonalization algorithm which combines two key ideas on quantum subspaces: a classical diagonalization based on quantum samples, and subspaces constructed with quantum Krylov states. We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial time under the working assumptions of Krylov quantum diagonalization and sparseness of the ground state. We then show numerical investigations of lattice Hamiltonians, which indicate that our method can outperform existing Krylov quantum diagonalization in the presence of shot noise, making our approach well-suited for near-term quantum devices. Finally, we carry out the largest ground-state quantum simulation of the single-impurity Anderson model on a system with $41$ bath sites, using $85$ qubits and up to $6 \cdot 10^3$ two-qubit gates on a Heron quantum processor, showing excellent agreement with density matrix renormalization group calculations.

Abstract: Sunny is a Julia package designed to serve the needs of the quantum magnetism community. It supports the specification of a very broad class of spin models and a diverse suite of numerical solvers. These include powerful methods for simulating spin dynamics both in and out of equilibrium. Uniquely, it features a broad generalization of classical and semiclassical approaches to SU(N) coherent states, which is useful for studying systems exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling or local entanglement effects. Sunny also offers a well-developed framework for calculating the dynamical spin structure factor, enabling direct comparison with scattering experiments. Ease of use is a priority, with tools for symmetry-guided modeling and interactive visualization.
