Title: Hydride superconductivity: here to stay, or to lead astray and soon go away?
Authors: J. E. Hirsch
Abstract: In a recent Comment (arXiv:2411.10522, Nat Rev Phys 7, 2 (2025)), fifteen prominent leaders in the field of condensed matter physics declare that hydride superconductivity is real and urge funding agencies to continue to support the field. I question the validity and constructiveness of their argument.

Title: Phase-Field Modeling of Fracture under Compression and Confinement in Anisotropic Geomaterials
Authors: Maryam Hakimzadeh, Carlos Mora-Corral, Noel Walkington, Giuseppe Buscarnera, Kaushik Dayal
Abstract: Strongly anisotropic geomaterials undergo fracture under compressive loading. This paper applies a phase-field fracture model to study this fracture process. While phase-field fracture models have several advantages, they provide unphysical predictions when the stress state is complex and includes compression that can cause crack faces to contact. Building on a phase-field model that accounts for compressive traction across the crack face, this paper extends the model to anisotropic fracture. The key features include: (1) a homogenized anisotropic elastic response and strongly-anisotropic model for the work to fracture; (2) an effective damage response that accounts consistently for compressive traction across the crack face, that is derived from the anisotropic elastic response; (3) a regularized crack normal field that overcomes the shortcomings of the isotropic setting, and enables the correct crack response, both across and transverse to the crack face. To test the model, we first compare the predictions to phase-field fracture evolution calculations in a fully-resolved layered specimen with spatial inhomogeneity, and show that it captures the overall patterns of crack growth. We then apply the model to previously-reported experimental observations of fracture evolution in laboratory specimens of shales under compression with confinement, and find that it predicts well the observed crack patterns in a broad range of loading conditions. We further apply the model to predict the growth of wing cracks under compression and confinement. The effective crack response model enables us to treat the initial crack simply as a non-singular damaged zone within the computational domain, thereby allowing for easy and general computations.

Title: Monitorization of the H-O Bond Flexibility
Authors: Chang Q Sun
Abstract: Unlike conventional thought, the H-O bond is flexible, instead, and sensitive to perturbation. This exercise empowers the electron and phonon spectroscopies with the Tight-binding approach, enabling a referential database to synchronically quantize the relaxation and flexibility of these identities for substances involving the H-O bond during phonon spectroscopy.

Title: Cavity Quantum Hall Hydrodynamics
Authors: Gabriel Cardoso, Liu Yang, Thors Hans Hansson, Qing-Dong Jiang
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, we study the coupling of quantum Hall (QH) hydrodynamics to quantum electrodynamics (QED) within a resonance cavity. In agreement with experimental observations, we find that the Hall conductivity remains unchanged. However, the coupling to the cavity induces a second-order quantum reactance effect, contributing distinctly to the longitudinal AC conductivity. This effect arises from the exchange of energy between the QH fluid and cavity photons. Beyond the topological response, we show that the cavity couples to collective excitations, resulting in a shift of the Kohn mode frequency. Our methods are broadly applicable to both integral and fractional QH liquids, and our results offer a universal perspective on the protection of topological properties against long-range interactions induced by electromagnetic cavity modes.

Title: C$_{60}$ building blocks with tuneable structures for tailored functionalities
Authors: Darius Kayley, Bo Peng
Abstract: We show that C$_{60}$ fullerene molecules can serve as promising building blocks in the construction of versatile crystal structures with unique symmetries using first-principles calculations. These phases include quasi-2D layered structures and 3D van der Waals crystals where the molecules adopt varied orientations. The interplay of molecular arrangement and lattice symmetry results in a variety of tuneable crystal structures with distinct properties. Specifically, the electronic structures of these phases vary significantly, offering potential for fine-tuning the band gap for electronics and optoelectronics. Additionally, the optical properties of these materials are strongly influenced by their crystalline symmetry and molecular alignment, providing avenues for tailoring optical responses for photonics. Our findings highlight the potential of fullerene-based building blocks in the rational design of functional materials.

Title: Dissipation-enhanced non-reciprocal superconductivity: application to multi-valley superconductors
Authors: Sayan Banerjee, Mathias S. Scheurer
Abstract: We here propose and study theoretically a non-equilibrium mechanism for the superconducting diode effect, which applies specifically to the case where time-reversal-symmetry -- a prerequisite for the diode effect -- is spontaneously broken by the superconducting electrons themselves. We employ a generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau formalism to capture dissipation effects in the non-equilibrium current-carrying state via phase slips and show that the coupling of the resistive current to the symmetry-breaking order is enough to induce a diode effect. Depending on parameters, the critical current asymmetry can be sizeable, asymptotically reaching a perfect diode efficiency; the competition of symmetry-breaking order, superconducting and resistive currents gives rise to rich physics, such as current-stabilized, non-equilibrium superconducting correlations. Although our mechanism is more general, the findings are particularly relevant to twisted trilayer and rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, where the symmetry-breaking order parameter refers to the imbalance of the two valleys of the systems.

Title: Out-of-equilibrium dynamical properties of Bose-Einstein condensates in a ramped up weak disorder
Authors: Rodrigo P. A. Lima, Milan Radonjić, Axel Pelster
Abstract: We theoretically study how the superfluid and condensate deformation of a weakly interacting ultracold Bose gas evolve during the ramp-up of an external weak disorder potential. Both resulting deformations turn out to consist of two distinct contributions, namely a reversible equilibrium one, already predicted by Huang and Meng in 1992, and a nonequilibrium dynamical one, whose magnitude depends on the details of the ramping protocol. For the specific case of the exponential ramp-up protocol, we are able to derive analytical time-dependent expressions for the above quantities. After a sufficiently long time, a steady state emerges that is generically out of equilibrium. We take the first step in investigating its properties by studying its relaxation dynamics. In addition, we analyze the two-time correlation function and elucidate its relation to the equilibrium and the dynamical part of the condensate deformation.

Title: Field-induced spin dynamics in i-MAX Tb compound
Authors: Dror Yahav, Daniel Potashnikov, Asaf Pesach, El'ad N. Caspi, Quanzheng Tao, Johanna Ros'en, Moshe Schechter, Ariel Maniv, Eran Maniv
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of spin dynamics in the (Mo2/3Tb1/3)2AlC i-MAX compound using ac susceptibility measurements across a range of magnetic fields. Unique behaviors were observed, including spin dynamics in the kHz range between mu_0 H~0.2T-6T, indicating a non-trivial superparamagnetic state, suggesting that the compound acts as a transitional system within the i-MAX family, bridging stable spin-dynamic materials and fluctuation-dominated ones. Field- and frequency-dependent magnetic phase transitions, coupled with relaxation behaviors, reveal complex interactions between spin density waves and superparamagnetic components. These findings, corroborated by uSR studies, deepen our understanding of magnetic phase diagrams and field-induced phenomena in i-MAX systems, laying the groundwork for further exploration of their unique properties and applications.

Title: Architected Dual-Network Solvent-free Adhesives for Stretchable Fabrics
Authors: Gabriela Moreira Lana, Cornelia Meissner, Siddhant Iyer, Xin Hu, Perin Jhaveri, Skylar Tibbits, Alfred J. Crosby
Abstract: Natural systems, such as tendons and spider silk, demonstrate how the combination of strength and stretchability can be effectively achieved by integrating stiff and flexible network structures. Inspired by these systems, we developed a novel, solvent-free dual-network adhesive based on a self-assembling ABA triblock copolymer, poly(methyl methacrylate)-poly(n-butyl acrylate)-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA-b-PnBA-b-PMMA), designed for applications requiring both high strength and stretchability. The triblock copolymer forms a physically crosslinked network through microdomains of PMMA end-blocks that provide structural integrity, while the PnBA mid-block forms a soft, stretchable matrix. To further enhance mechanical performance, a second poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA) network is polymerized in situ, locking the PMMA microdomains in place and creating a load-bearing system. By varying the crosslinking density of the secondary network, we tailor the adhesive's mechanical properties (Young's modulus: 0.17 - 1.18 MPa) to suit different substrates, creating a mechanically transparent seam. The resulting dual-network system combines different strategies to achieve high strength and stretchability, with adhesive performance comparable to industrial methods such as sewing, particularly in bonding neoprene fabric composites and sealing the joints. Our solvent-free approach also eliminates the need for lengthy solvent evaporation steps, offering an eco-friendly and more efficient alternative for flexible adhesive applications in fields such as soft robotics, flexible electronics, and sports apparel.

Title: Magnetoconductivity and quantum oscillations in intercalated graphite CaC$_6$ with the Fermi surface reconstructed by the uniaxial charge density wave
Authors: Petra Grozić, Anatoly M. Kadigrobov, Zoran Rukelj, Ivan Kupčić, Danko Radić
Abstract: We report a magnetoconductivity tensor $\sigma$ for the intercalated graphite CaC$_6$, in the ground state of the uniaxial charge density wave (CDW), under conditions of coherent magnetic breakdown due to strong external magnetic field $B$ perpendicular to the conducting plane. The uniaxial charge density wave reconstructs initially closed Fermi surface into an open one, accompanied with formation of a pseudo-gap in the electron density of states around the Fermi energy. The magnetoconductivity tensor is calculated within the quantum density matrix and semiclassical magnetic breakdown approach focused on modification of the main, so-called classical contribution to magnetoconductivity by magnetic breakdown, neglecting the higher order corrections. In the presence of magnetic breakdown, in spite of open Fermi surface configuration, all classical magnetoconductivity components, the one along the CDW apex $\sigma_{xx} \sim 1/B^2$, perpendicular to the CDW apex $\sigma_{yy} \sim const$, as well as the Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy} \sim 1/B$, undergo strong quantum oscillations vs. inverse magnetic field. Those oscillations do not appear as a mere additive correction, but rather alter the classical result becoming an inherent part of it, turning it to essentially non-classical.

Title: Magnetic properties of Ge, Re and Cr substituted Fe$_5$SiB$_2$
Authors: M. Casadei, M.M. Isah, R. Cabassi, G. Trevisi, S. Fabbrici, M. Belli, C. de Julián Fernández, G. Allodi, V. Fournée, S. Sanna, F. Albertini
Abstract: One of the possible approaches to decrease the demand for critical elements such as rare earths is to develop new sustainable magnets. Iron-based materials are suitable for gap magnets applications since iron is the most abundant ferromagnetic element on Earth. Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ is a candidate as gap magnet thanks to its high Curie temperature (T$_{\text{C}} \sim$ 800 K) and saturation magnetization (M$_{\text{S}}\sim$ 140 Am$^2$kg$^{-1}$). However its anisotropy field is too low for applications (H$_{\text{A}} \sim$ 0.8 T). In order to increase the anisotropy value, we synthesized a series of Ge, Re and Cr substituted Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ samples and studied their magnetic properties. They all crystallize in the Cr$_5$B$_3$-type tetragonal structure with the $I4/mcm$ space group. Curie temperature (T$_{\text{C}}$ = 803 K) and saturation magnetization (M$_{\text{S}}$ = 138 Am$^2$kg$^{-1}$) are slightly decreased by elemental substitution with Re having the largest effect. Despite being reduced, T$_{\text{C}}$ and M$_{\text{S}}$ still maintain significant values (T$_{\text{C}}>$ 750 K and M$_{\text{S}}$ = 118 Am$^2$kg$^{-1}$). The room temperature anisotropy field has been measured by Singular Point Detection (SPD) and increases by about 15% upon Re substitution, reaching 0.92 T for Fe$_{4.75}$Re$_{0.25}$SiB$_2$. We have also used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and SPD measurements to study the spin reorientation transition which takes place at 172 K and we have found that it is partially suppressed by substitution of Ge from 172 K to 140 K and completely suppressed upon Cr and Re substitution.

Title: Generation of spin wave packets by reconfigurable magnonic heterojunctions
Authors: A. Roxburgh, P. Micaletti, F. Montoncello, E. Iacocca
Abstract: Nano-magnonic crystals are magnetic waveguides whose magnetic parameters are modulated at the nanoscale. The super-lattice structure enables a band structure and magnonic band-gaps. Here, we numerically investigate the field tunability of such a magnonic band-gap. By subjecting different parts of the nano-magnonic crystal to a field, we realize a magnonic heterojunction. A numerical demonstration of an active modification of the band structure leads to magnonic amplitude modulation in the linear regime and magnonic frequency combs in the nonlinear regime. Our results offer further opportunities for nano-magnonic crystals and incite their experimental realization.

Title: Striped Spin Density Wave in a Graphene/Black Phosphorous Heterostructure
Authors: Dolev Haddad, H.A. Fertig, Efrat Shimshoni
Abstract: A bilayer formed by stacking two distinct materials creates a moiré lattice, which can serve as a platform for novel electronic phases. In this work we study a unique example of such a system: the graphene-black phosphorus heterostructure (G/BP), which has been suggested to have an intricate band structure. Most notably, the valence band hosts a quasi-one-dimensional region in the Brillouin zone of high density of states, suggesting that various many-body electronic phases are likely to emerge. We derive an effective tight-binding model that reproduces this band structure, and explore the emergent broken-symmetry phases when interactions are introduced. Employing a mean-field analysis, we find that the favored ground-state exhibits a striped spin density wave (SDW) order, characterized by either one of two-fold degenerate wave-vectors that are tunable by gating. Further exploring the phase-diagram controlled by gate voltage and the interaction strength, we find that the SDW-ordered state undergoes a metal to insulator transition via an intermediate metallic phase which supports striped SDW correlations. Possible experimental signatures are discussed, in particular a highly anisotropic dispersion of the collective excitations which should be manifested in electric and thermal transport.

Title: Anomalous skew scattering of plasma waves in a Dirac electron fluid
Authors: Cooper Finnigan, Dmitry Efimkin
Abstract: The Berry phase-related nontrivial electronic band geometries can significantly influence bulk and edge plasma waves, or plasmons, resulting in their non-reciprocal propagation and opening new opportunities for plasmonics. In the present work, we extend the hydrodynamic framework to describe the scattering of plasma waves in a Dirac electron fluid off a circular region with an induced nonzero anomalous Hall response, i.e. a Berry flux target. We demonstrate that the scattering has a giant asymmetry or skewness and exhibits a series of resonances. The latter appears due to a chiral non-topological trapped mode circulating the target. We discuss possible experimental realizations, including the surface of a topological insulator film and graphene irradiated by the circularly polarized beam.

Title: Weyl semimetallic, N\'eel, spiral, and vortex states in the Rashba-Hubbard model
Authors: Sebastião dos Anjos Sousa-Júnior, Rubem Mondaini
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of magnetic phases in the Hubbard model under strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling on a square lattice. By using Lanczos exact diagonalization and determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations, we explore the emergence of various magnetic alignments as the ratio between the regular hopping amplitude, $t$, and the Rashba hopping term, $t_R$, is varied over a broad range of Hubbard interaction strengths, $U$. In the limit $t_R \rightarrow 0$, the system exhibits Néel antiferromagnetic order, while when $t \sim t_R$, a spiral magnetic phase emerges due to the induced anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. For $t_R > t$, we identify the onset of a spin vortex phase. At the extreme limit $t = 0$($t_R \neq 0 $), we perform finite-size scaling analysis in the Weyl semimetal regime to pinpoint the quantum critical point associated with the spin vortex phase, employing sign-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations - the extracted critical exponents are consistent with a Gross-Neveu-type quantum phase transition.

Title: Unveiling potential candidates for rare-earth-free permanent magnet and magnetocaloric effect applications: a high throughput screening in Fe-N alloys
Authors: Qiang Gao, Ergen Bao, Ijaz Shahid, Hui Ma, Xing-Qiu Chen
Abstract: Based on high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we have found 49 ferromag-netic cases in FexN1-x (0<x<1) compounds, focusing especially on permanent magnet and giant magnetocaloric effect applications. It is found that 15 compounds are potential permanent mag-nets with a magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy more than 1 MJ/m3, filling in the gap of appli-cation spectrum between high-performance and widely used permanents. Among the potential permanent magnets, Fe2N can be classified as a hard magnet while the other 14 compounds can be classified as semi-hard magnets. According to the calculations of magnetic deformation proxy, 40 compounds are identified as potential giant magnetocaloric effect candidates. We suspect that Fe-N compounds provide fine opportunities for applications in both rare-earth free permanent magnets and magnetocaloric effect.

Title: Visualization of intervalley coherent phase in PtSe2/HOPG heterojunction
Authors: Kai Fan, Bohao Li, Wen-Xuan Qiu, Ting-Fei Guo, Jian-Wang Zhou, Tao Xie, Wen-Hao Zhang, Chao-Fei Liu, Fengcheng Wu, Ying-Shuang Fu
Abstract: Intervalley coherent (IVC) phase in graphene systems arises from the coherent superposition of wave functions of opposite valleys, whose direct microscopic visualization provides pivotal insight into the emergent physics but remains elusive. Here, we successfully visualize the IVC phase in a heterostructure of monolayer PtSe2 on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. Using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we observe a Root3 by Root3 modulation pattern superimposed on the higher-order moire superlattice of the heterostructure, which correlates with a small gap opening around the Fermi level and displays an anti-phase real-space conductance distribution of the two gap edges. Such modulation pattern and small-gap vanish on the heterostructure of monolayer PtSe2 on bilayer-graphene-covered SiC substrate, due to the increased carrier density in the bilayer graphene. We provide a theoretical mechanism that the Root3 by Root3 modulation pattern originates from the IVC phase of few-layer graphene, which is magnified by the higher-order moire superlattice. Our work achieves visualization of the IVC phase, and develops an avenue for its generation and amplification via a moiré interface.

Title: Reentrant topological phases and spin density wave induced by 1D moir\'e potentials
Authors: Guo-Qing Zhang, Ling-Zhi Tang, L. F. Quezada, Shi-Hai Dong, Dan-Wei Zhang
Abstract: Exotic topological and correlated phases induced by moiré potentials have recently been explored in 2D twisted bilayer graphene systems. Here we investigate spin-$1/2$ interacting fermionic atoms in the 1D moiré optical superlattice formed by the superposition of two commensurate potentials. We reveal the reentrant topological phases and periodic-moiré-spin density wave (PM-SDW) of the ground states in both non-interacting and interacting cases. The reentrant topological phases are driven by the moiré potential with the sequent trivial-topological-trivial-topological-trivial transition. The critical exponent of topological transitions and the localization properties of the single-particle eigenstates are studied. The PM-SDW order of the many-body ground state is contributed from the moiré potential, and is enhanced by the on-site interaction but suppressed by the nearest-neighbor interaction. Our results enrich the topological physics with multiple transitions and spin-density orders in 1D moiré systems, which might be experimentally realized with ultracold atoms in tunable optical lattices.

Title: Acceleration of enzymatic reactions due to nearby inactive binding sites
Authors: Hila Katznelson, Saar Rahav
Abstract: Many biological molecular motors and machines are driven by chemical reactions that occur in specific catalytic sites. We study whether the arrival of molecules to such an active site can be accelerated by the presence of a nearby inactive site. Our approach is based on comparing the steady-state current in simple models to reference models without an inactive site. We identify two parameter regimes in which the reaction is accelerated. We then find the transition rates that maximize this acceleration, and use them to determine the underlying mechanisms in each region. In the first regime, the inactive site stores a molecule in order to release it following a reaction, when the neighboring catalytic site is empty. In the second regime, the inactive site releases a molecule when the catalytic site is full, in order to impede the molecules from leaving the active site before they react. For the storage mechanism, which is more likely to be biologically relevant, the acceleration can reach up to 15%, depending on parameters.

Title: Topological Anderson insulators by latent symmetry
Authors: Jing-Run Lin, Shuo Wang, Hui Li, Zheng-Wei Zuo
Abstract: Topological Anderson insulators represent a class of disorder-induced, nontrivial topological states. In this study, we propose a feasible strategy to unveil and design the latent-symmetry protected topological Anderson insulators. By employing the isospectral reduction approach from graph theory, we reduce a family of the disordered multi-atomic chains to the disordered dimerized chain characterized by energy-dependent potentials and hoppings, which exhibits the chiral symmetry or inversion symmetry. According to the topological invariants, bulk polarization, and the divergence of localization length of the topological bound edge states in the reduced disordered system, the gapped and ungapped topological Anderson states with latent symmetry could be identified in the original disordered multi-atomic systems. The concept of topological Anderson insulating phases protected by the geometric symmetries and tenfold-way classification is thus extended to the various types of latent symmetry cases. This work paves the way for exploiting topological Anderson insulators in terms of latent symmetries.

Title: Revisiting the matrix elements of the position operator in the crystal momentum representation
Authors: M. S. Si, G. P. Zhang
Abstract: Fewer operators are more fundamental than the position operator in a crystal. But since it is not translationally invariant in crystal momentum representation (CMR), how to properly represent it is nontrivial. Over half a century, various methods have been proposed, but they often lead to either highly singular derivatives or extremely arcane expressions. Here we propose a resolution to this problem by directly computing their matrix elements between two Bloch states. We show that the position operator is a full matrix in CMR, where the off-diagonal elements in crystal momentum $\bf k$ only appear along the direction of the position vector. Our formalism, free of singular derivative and degeneracy difficulties, can describe an array of physical properties, from intraband transitions, polarization with or without spin-orbit coupling, orbital angular momentum, to susceptibilities.

Title: Decoupling the effects of ripples from tensile strain on the thermal conductivity of graphene and understanding the role of curvature on the thermal conductivity of graphene with grain boundaries
Authors: Abhishek Kumar, Kunwar Abhikeern, Amit Singh
Abstract: Ripples, curvature, and grain boundaries in graphene can significantly alter its thermal conductivity (TC), which is paramount in various applications including thermal management etc. In this study, we conducted extensive equilibrium MD simulations and used the Green-Kubo method to elucidate the impact of ripples on the TC of graphene and the impact of curvature and tilt angles characterizing a grain boundary (GB) on the TC of polycrystalline graphene. Although tensile and compressive strains have been known to control the amount of ripples, the effects of strain and ripple on the TC have not been decoupled. With the help of Green-Kubo simulations on larger graphene samples and simulations based on the spectral energy density method on smaller samples without ripples, we show that both samples show an approximately 30% decrease in TC between tensile strains 3% and 10% when ripples become negligible even in the larger sample. Between 0 and 3% strain, when both ripples and strains are present in the larger sample, we decouple the effect of ripples from strain on the TC and show that ripples alone reduce the TC of the larger unstrained sample by approximately 61%. We also present a unique technique to introduce curvatures in the graphene sheet containing GBs by performing MD simulations under NPT ensembles with a constant pressure of 200 bar along the x-axis. Our analysis suggests that the Green-Kubo TC linearly decreases with curvature; however, the rate of decrease depends on the tilt angles of the grain boundary. An analysis of the TC in graphene samples with GBs of varying tilt angles reveals that the TC strongly depends on the tilt angles. Thus, our research underscores the pivotal role of ripple, curvature, and GB in modulating the thermal conductivity of graphene.

Title: Enhanced Condensation Through Rotation
Authors: Maxim Chernodub, Frank Wilczek
Abstract: We argue that the rotation of a thin superconducting cylinder can increase the critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition substantially. The phenomenon can be interpreted as an effective negative moment of inertia associated with condensation of Cooper pairs. We give quantitative estimates for a thin cylinder of aluminum.

Title: Can structure influence hydrovoltaic energy generation? Insights from the metallic 1T' and semiconducting 2H phases of MoS$_2$
Authors: Kaushik Suvigya, Saini Lalita, Siva Nemala Sankar, Andrea Capasso, Li-Hsien Yeh, Kalon Gopinadhan
Abstract: Hydrovoltaic power generation from liquid water and ambient moisture has attracted considerable research efforts. However, there is still limited consensus on the optimal material properties required to maximize the power output. Here, we used laminates of two different phases of layered MoS$_2$ -- metallic 1T' and semiconducting 2H -- as representative systems to investigate the critical influence of specific characteristics, such as hydrophilicity, interlayer channels, and structure, on the hydrovoltaic performance. The metallic 1T' phase was synthesized via a chemical exfoliation process and assembled into laminates, which can then be converted to the semiconducting 2H phase by thermal annealing. Under liquid water conditions, the 1T' laminates, having a channel size of 6 angstroms, achieved a peak power density of 2.0 mW m$^{-2}$, significantly outperforming the 2H phase, lacking defined channels, that produced a power of 2.4 microW m$^{-2}$. Our theoretical analysis suggests that energy generation in these hydrophilic materials primarily arises from electro-kinetic and surface diffusion mechanisms. These findings highlight the crucial role of phase-engineered MoS$_2$ and underscore the potential of 2D material laminates in advancing hydrovoltaic energy technologies.

Title: Quasi-two-dimensional magnetism and antiferromagnetic ground state in Li$_2$FeSiO$_4$
Authors: W. Hergett, N. Bouldi, M. Jonak, C. Neef, C. Ritter, M. Abdel-Hafiez, F. Seewald, H.-H. Klauss, M. W.-Haverkort, R. Klingeler
Abstract: Our experimental (neutron diffraction, Mössbauer spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat) and numerical studies on the evolution of short- and long-range magnetic order in $\gamma_{\rm II}$-Li\(_2\)FeSiO\(_4\) suggest a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) nature of magnetism. The experimental data obtained on single crystals imply long-range antiferromagnetic order below $T_{\rm N}= 17$~K. A broad maximum in magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ at $T_{\rm m}\simeq 28$~K, observation of magnetic entropy changes up to 100~K and anisotropy in $\chi$ are indicative of low-dimensional magnetism and suggest short-range magnetic correlations up to 200~K. Neutron diffraction shows that long-range antiferromagnetic order is characterised by the propagation vector k=(1/2,0,1/2). The ordered moment $\mu = 2.50(2) \mu_B$ /Fe, at $T = 1.5$~K, is along the crystallographic $a$-axis. This is consistent with the observed static hyperfine field of $B_{\rm hyp}=14.8(3)$\,T by Mössbauer spectroscopy which indicates significant orbital contributions. The temperature dependence of $B_{\rm hyp}$ yields the critical exponent $\beta=0.116(12)$ which is in the regime of the 2D Ising behaviour. LSDA+U studies exploiting the experimental spin structure suggest dominating magnetic exchange coupling within the $ac$-layers (i.e., $J_3\simeq -6$~K and $J_6\simeq-2$~K) while interlayer coupling is much smaller and partly frustrated. This confirms the 2D nature of magnetism and is in full agreement with the experimental findings.

Title: Dynamic wetting of concentrated granular suspensions
Authors: Reza Azizmalayeri, Peyman Rostami, Thomas Witzmann, Christopher O. Klein, Günter K. Auernhammer
Abstract: Many materials, such as paints and inks used in applications like painting and 3D printing, are concentrated granular suspensions. In such systems, the contact line dynamics and the internal structure of the suspension interact through shear-rate dependent viscosity and internal structural rearrangements. The shear rate increases sharply near moving contact lines, profoundly influencing the non-Newtonian rheology of dense suspensions. Frictional contacts become significant as particles approach each other, forming force-carrying networks of contacts. While hydrodynamic solutions can describe dilute suspensions, their applicability near advancing contact lines in dense suspensions remains unclear. This study explores such applicability by systematically varying inter-particle interactions. We use silica suspensions in two refractive-index matched media: (i) aqueous 2,$2^{\prime}$-thiodiethanol (weak interactions) and (ii) aqueous sodium thiocyanate solution (strong interactions). The two samples vary substantially in their rheological response. Using astigmatism particle tracking velocimetry (APTV), we precisely track the 3D motion of tracer particles within the suspension. To observe the drop over a long travel distance, we use a configuration consisting of a pinned droplet on a moving substrate. We observe distinct behaviours depending on particle interactions and the resulting suspension rheology. The more the particle interactions play a role, i.e., the more pronounced the non-Newtonian effects, the stronger the measured flow profiles differ from the Newtonian solution to the hydrodynamic equations. In case of the viscous suspension, a notable deviation from Newtonian behaviour is observed. Conversely, the yield-stress suspension exhibits plug flow over the substrate, with Newtonian-like behaviour restricted to the yielded region near the substrate.

Title: Energy spectra and fluxes of two-dimensional turbulent quantum droplets
Authors: Shawan Kumar Jha, Mahendra K. Verma, S. I. Mistakidis, Pankaj Kumar Mishra
Abstract: We explore the energy spectra and associated fluxes of turbulent two-dimensional quantum droplets subjected to a rotating paddling potential which is removed after a few oscillation periods. A systematic analysis on the impact of the characteristics (height and velocity) of the rotating potential and the droplet atom number reveals the emergence of different dynamical response regimes. These are classified by utilizing the second-order sign correlation function and the ratio of incompressible versus compressible kinetic energies. They involve, vortex configurations ranging from vortex dipoles to vortex clusters and randomly distributed vortex-antivortex pairs. The incompressible kinetic energy spectrum features Kolmogorov ($k^{-5/3}$) and Vinen like ($k^{-1}$) scaling in the infrared regime, while a $k^{-3}$ decay in the ultraviolet captures the presence of vortices. The compressible spectrum shows $k^{-3/2}$ scaling within the infrared and $k$ power law in the case of enhanced sound-wave emission suggesting thermalization. Significant distortions are observed in the droplet periphery in the presence of a harmonic trap. A direct energy cascade (from large to small length scales) is mainly identified through the flux. Our findings offer insights into the turbulent response of exotic phases-of-matter, featuring quantum fluctuations, and may inspire investigations aiming to unravel self-similar nonequilibrium dynamics.

Title: Kinetic Model of the Emergence of Autocatalysis
Authors: P. O. Mchedlov-Petrosyan, L. N. Davydov
Abstract: We develop a formal model of the emergence of self-constructing objects (e.g. heteropolymers with autocatalytic capability) in an open system, which don't contain such objects initially. The objects are constructed from subunits (e.g. monomers). Each object is characterized by the difference of self-instructed reproduction and decomposition rate only. This difference, divided by a common dimensional constant, is called ``productivity''. Due to external influence the productivity of each object can randomly change. The system as a whole is subjected to external limitation: the total number of the objects is conserved (e.g., by the controlled influx of monomers). We consider such process as possibly simplest example of self-organization. We obtained exact solutions of our model for several presumed mechanisms of random change of the productivity. We have shown that the probability to find self-constructing objects in the system necessarily increases, even if initially it was equal to zero.

Title: Ohm's law, Joule heat, and Planckian dissipation
Authors: Hiroyasu Koizumi
Abstract: We will show that the Planckian dissipation observed in strange metals including cuprate superconductors can be attributed to the dissipation due to the gauge fluctuation of the Berry connection. In the due course, we revisit the well-studied dissipation problem, Joule heating by electric current in metallic wires. It is known that Poynting's theorem explains it in a strange manner: The energy for the Joule heat enters from the outside of the wire as radiation; and consumed in the wire. This explanation is rectified by considering the generation of the chemical potential gradient inside the wire by the battery connection. Then, the Joule heat is obtained as the energy of the emitted radiation from the wire with its energy supplied by the connected battery. We also examine discharging of a capacitor and supercurrent flow through the Josephson junction.

Title: Exciton Dynamics and Quantum Efficiencies in Optically Coupled OLEDs: A Unified Quantum Master Equation Approach
Authors: Olli Siltanen, Kimmo Luoma, Konstantinos S. Daskalakis
Abstract: The primary function of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is to convert electrons into photons. However, only 25 % of the electronic states (singlets) in electrically excited fluorescent molecules can emit light, which is why triplet harvesting has attracted significant attention. Specifically, one often aims to maximize the rate of triplet-to-singlet conversion, while at the same time, it is crucial to depopulate the singlets fast enough -- before they convert to triplets or interact with other excited states, potentially breaking molecular bonds. Planar microcavities provide a viable architecture to address these issues. By confining the emitters within planar microcavities one can couple the excitons to cavity modes and engineer the population dynamics to one's liking. While the weak-coupling regime is renowned for Purcell-enhanced emission, strongly coupled excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates known as polaritons. To fully understand and optimize exciton-photon interactions and light-emission mechanisms across various coupling regimes, a unified theory of optically coupled (and uncoupled) OLEDs is needed. In this article, we introduce a quantum master equation model spanning the zero-, weak-, and strong-coupling regimes. We derive the different rates using Fermi's golden rule and Marcus theory, show how the different regimes converge, and finally evaluate the internal quantum efficiencies in all cases.

Title: Reconfigurable Filamentary Conduction in Thermally Stable Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework (ZIF-8) Resistive Switching Devices
Authors: Divya Kaushik, Nitin Kumar, Harshit Sharma, Pukhraj Prajapat, Mehamalini V., G.Sambandamurthy, Ritu Srivastava
Abstract: The rapid growth of digital technology has driven the need for efficient storage solutions, positioning memristors as promising candidates for next-generation non-volatile memory (NVM) due to their superior electrical properties. Organic and inorganic materials each offer distinct advantages for resistive switching (RS) performance, while hybrid materials like metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) combine the strengths of both. In this study, we present a resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) device utilizing zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8), a MOF material, as the resistive switching layer. The ZIF-8 film was synthesized via a simple solution process method at room temperature and subsequently characterized. The Al/ZIF-8/ITO device demonstrates bipolar resistive switching behaviour with an on/off resistance ratio of 100, stable retention up to 10000 seconds, and consistent performance across 60 cycles while exhibiting robust thermal stability from -20 C to 100 C. Low-frequency noise and impedance spectroscopy measurements suggest a filamentary switching mechanism. Additionally, the memory state can be tuned by adjusting the reset voltage, pointing to potential as multi-level memory. Potentiation and depression experiments further highlight the devices promise for neuromorphic applications. With high stability, tunability, and strong performance, the ZIF-8 based ReRAM shows great promise for advanced NVM and neuromorphic computing applications.

Title: Projected ensemble in a system with conserved charges with local support
Authors: Sandipan Manna, Sthitadhi Roy, G. J. Sreejith
Abstract: The investigation of ergodicity or lack thereof in isolated quantum many-body systems has conventionally focused on the description of the reduced density matrices of local subsystems in the contexts of thermalization, integrability, and localization. Recent experimental capabilities to measure the full distribution of quantum states in Hilbert space and the emergence of specific state ensembles have extended this to questions of {\textit{deep thermalization}}, by introducing the notion of the {\textit{projected ensemble}} -- ensembles of pure states of a subsystem obtained by projective measurements on its complement. While previous work examined chaotic unitary circuits, Hamiltonian evolution, and systems with global conserved charges, we study the projected ensemble in systems where there are an extensive number of conserved charges all of which have (quasi)local support. We employ a strongly disordered quantum spin chain which shows many-body localized dynamics over long timescales as well as the $\ell$-bit model, a phenomenological archetype of a many-body localized system, with the charges being $1$-local in the latter. In particular, we discuss the dependence of the projected ensemble on the measurement basis. Starting with random direct product states, we find that the projected ensemble constructed from time-evolved states converges to a Scrooge ensemble at late times and in the large system limit except when the measurement operator is close to the conserved charges. This is in contrast to systems with global conserved charges where the ensemble varies continuously with the measurement basis. We relate these observations to the emergence of Porter-Thomas distribution in the probability distribution of bitstring measurement probabilities.

Title: Electronic band structures of topological kagome materials
Authors: Man Li, Huan Ma, Rui Lou, Shancai Wang
Abstract: The kagome lattice has garnered significant attention due to its ability to host quantum spin Fermi liquid states. Recently, the combination of unique lattice geometry, electron-electron correlations, and adjustable magnetism in solid kagome materials has led to the discovery of numerous fascinating quantum properties. These include unconventional superconductivity, charge and spin density waves (CDW/SDW), pair density waves (PDW), and Chern insulator phases. These emergent states are closely associated with the distinctive characteristics of the kagome lattice's electronic structure, such as van Hove singularities, Dirac fermions, and flat bands, which can exhibit exotic quasi-particle excitations under different symmetries and magnetic conditions. Recently, various quantum kagome materials have been developed, typically consisting of kagome layers stacked along the $z$-axis with atoms either filling the geometric centers of the kagome lattice or embedded between the layers. In this topical review, we begin by introducing the fundamental properties of several kagome materials. To gain an in-depth understanding of the relationship between topology and correlation, we then discuss the complex phenomena observed in these systems. These include the simplest kagome metal $T_3X$, kagome intercalation metal $TX$, and the ternary compounds $AT_6X_6$ and $RT_3X_5$ ($A$ = Li, Mg, Ca, or rare earth; $T$ = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; $X$ = Sn, Ge; $R$ = K, Rb, Cs). Finally, we provide a perspective on future experimental work in this field.

Title: Light Interaction With a Space-Time-Modulated Josephson Junction Array and Application to Angular-Frequency Beam Multiplexing
Authors: Sajjad Taravati
Abstract: Josephson junctions, as pivotal components of modern technologies such as superconducting quantum computing, owe their prominence to their unique nonlinear properties at low temperatures. Despite their extensive use in static configurations, the study of dynamic Josephson junctions, particularly under space-time modulation, remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the interaction and transmission of electromagnetic waves through arrays of space-time-modulated Josephson junctions. A comprehensive mathematical framework is presented to model the propagation of electric and magnetic fields within and beyond these structures. We demonstrate how such dynamic arrays enable groundbreaking four-dimensional light manipulation, achieving angular-frequency beam multiplexing through a seamless integration of frequency conversion and beam-splitting functionalities. These advancements open new horizons for electromagnetic field engineering, with far-reaching implications for superconducting quantum technologies, next-generation wireless communications, biomedical sensing, and radar systems.

Title: The coherence peak of unconventional superconductors in the charge channel
Authors: Pengfei Li, Zheng Li, Kun Jiang
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a systematic investigation of the coherence peak in unconventional superconductors as they transition into the superconducting phase at $T_c$. Using $d$-wave cuprates as an example, we reveal the presence of a coherence peak below $T_c$ in the charge channel. The nuclear quadrupole relaxation rate is shown to be an effective method for detecting this unconventional coherence peak, with the superconducting coherence factor playing a pivotal role in its emergence. Additionally, we explore the influence of correlation effects, which further enhance this phenomenon. Extending our analysis, we demonstrate the existence of a similar coherence peak in ultrasonic attenuation and iron-based superconductors. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on probing superconducting gap symmetry in unconventional superconductors.

Title: A self-learning magnetic Hopfield neural network with intrinsic gradient descent adaption

Abstract: Physical neural networks using physical materials and devices to mimic synapses and neurons offer an energy-efficient way to implement artificial neural networks. Yet, training physical neural networks are difficult and heavily relies on external computing resources. An emerging concept to solve this issue is called physical self-learning that uses intrinsic physical parameters as trainable weights. Under external inputs (i.e. training data), training is achieved by the natural evolution of physical parameters that intrinsically adapt modern learning rules via autonomous physical process, eliminating the requirements on external computation this http URL, we demonstrate a real spintronic system that mimics Hopfield neural networks (HNN) and unsupervised learning is intrinsically performed via the evolution of physical process. Using magnetic texture defined conductance matrix as trainable weights, we illustrate that under external voltage inputs, the conductance matrix naturally evolves and adapts Oja's learning algorithm in a gradient descent manner. The self-learning HNN is scalable and can achieve associative memories on patterns with high similarities. The fast spin dynamics and reconfigurability of magnetic textures offer an advantageous platform towards efficient autonomous training directly in materials.

Title: Linear Scaling Calculation of Atomic Forces and Energies with Machine Learning Local Density Matrix
Authors: Zaizhou Xin, Yang Zhong, Xingao Gong, Hongjun Xiang
Abstract: Accurately calculating energies and atomic forces with linear-scaling methods is a crucial approach to accelerating and improving molecular dynamics simulations. In this paper, we introduce HamGNN-DM, a machine learning model designed to predict atomic forces and energies using local density matrices in molecular dynamics simulations. This approach achieves efficient predictions with a time complexity of O(n), making it highly suitable for large-scale systems. Experiments in different systems demonstrate that HamGNN-DM achieves DFT-level precision in predicting the atomic forces in different system sizes, which is vital for the molecular dynamics. Furthermore, this method provides valuable electronic structure information throughout the dynamics and exhibits robust performance.

Title: Dynamical electron-phonon vertex correction
Authors: Andrea Marini
Abstract: The dynamical screening of the electron-phonon vertex is due to the retarded oscillations of the electronic charge following the phonon annihilation into an electron-hole pair. This retardation induces a frequency dependence of the electron-phonon interaction that is commonly neglected. In this work I propose a dynamical perturbative expansion that, while being diagrammatically consistent, defines a controllable and physically sound method to include dynamical screening effects in the electron-phonon vertex. The method is applied to the phonon self-energy of the homogeneous electron gas where I show how retardation effects are driven by the ratio between the plasma and the phonon frequencies. I finally propose a simple approach to estimate the importance of dynamical corrections. This method is applied to the paradigmatic case of MgB$_2$ to show the non--perturbative and large retardation effects that characterize this peculiar material.

Title: Dense array of elastic hairs obstructing a fluidic channel
Authors: Etienne Jambon-Puillet
Abstract: Dense arrays of soft hair-like structures protruding from surfaces in contact with fluids are ubiquitous in living systems. Fluid flows can easily deform these soft hairs which in turn impacts the flow properties. At the microscale, flows are often confined which exacerbates this feedback loop since the hair deformation has a strong impact on the flow geometry. Here, I investigate experimentally and theoretically pressure driven flows in laminar channels obstructed by a dense array of elastic hairs. I show that the system displays a nonlinear hydraulic resistance that I model by treating the hair bed as a deformable porous media. The porous media height and thus degree of confinement results from the deflection of individual hairs. The resulting fluid-structure interaction model is leveraged to identify the dimensionless drag force $\hat{f}_0$ controlling the elasto-viscous coupling and used to design passive flow control elements for microfluidic networks.

Title: High critical field superconductivity in a 3d dominated lightweight equiatomic high entropy alloy
Authors: S. Jangid, P. K. Meena, R. K. Kushwaha, S. Srivastava, P. Manna, S. Sharma, P. Mishra, R. P. Singh
Abstract: The lightweight high entropy alloy represents an innovative class of multicomponent systems that combine low density with the exceptional mechanical properties of high-entropy alloys. We present a detailed synthesis and investigation of a 3d rich equiatomic high entropy alloy superconductor Sc-Ti-V-Nb-Cu, which crystallizes in a body-centered cubic structure. Magnetization, electrical resistivity, and heat capacity measurements confirm weakly coupled bulk type II superconductivity with a 7.21(3) K transition temperature and an upper critical field of 12.9(1) T. The upper critical field approaches the Pauli paramagnetic limit, suggesting potential unconventional behavior. The low density, moderate transition temperature, and high upper critical field stand out Sc-Ti-V-Nb-Cu as a promising candidate for next-generation superconducting device applications.

Title: Out-of-plane Edelstein effects: Electric-field induced magnetization in $p$-wave magnets
Authors: Motohiko Ezawa
Abstract: In-plane magnetization is induced by the Edelstein effect in the Rashba spin-orbit interaction system. However, out-of-plane magnetization is more useful for switching a ferromagnetic memory. We study analytically and numerically electric-field induced magnetization in $p$-wave magnets with the aid of the Rashba interaction based on a simple two-band model. The out-of-plane magnetization is induced when the Néel vector of the $p$-wave magnet is along the $z$ direction. We also show that no magnetization is induced in the absence of the Rashba interaction. The electric-field induced magnetization will be useful for future switching technology of ferromagnetic memories based on the $p$-wave magnet.

Title: Stochastic Thermodynamics of the Two-Dimensional Model of Transistors
Authors: Jiayin Gu
Abstract: We adopt a stochastic approach to study the charge transport in transistors. In this approach, the hole and electron densities are ruled by diffusion-reaction stochastic partial differential equations satisfying local detailed balance condition. The electric field is supposed to be concentrated in very narrow regions around the two junctions and is also approximated to be static. In this way, not only the laws of electricity, thermodynamics, and microreversibility is consistent within this approach, but also the transistor can be easily modeled as a two-dimensional system. We perform the full counting statistics of the two coupled currents, and the fluctuation theorem is shown to hold. Moreover, we show that the geometric shape of the transistor exert great influence on the transport behavior. By modeling the transistor in two dimensions, the signal-amplification factor up to about $164$ can be achieved, which is comparable to the typical value of realistic transistors in industry.

Title: Responses for one-dimensional quantum spin systems via tensor networks
Authors: Jiayin Gu
Abstract: Tensor networks are adopted to calculate the responses for one-dimensional quantum spin systems that are initially in thermal equilibrium. The Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal fields is used as the benchmarking system. The linear and second-order responses of the magnetization in $z$-direction induced by the time-dependent force conjugated with the magnetization in $x$-direction are calculated. In addition, the magnetization in $z$-direction is also exactly calculated in response to this excitation. As expected, the first two responses are shown to be excellent corrections to the equilibrium magnetization in $z$-direction when the excitation is weak. This result represents an illustrative example of the response theory for nontrivial quantum many-body systems.

Title: Dynamic realization of emergent high-dimensional optical vortices
Authors: Dongha Kim, Geonhyeong Park, Yun-Seok Choi, Arthur Baucour, Jisung Hwang, Sanghyeok Park, Hee Seong Yun, Jonghwa Shin, Haiwen Wang, Shanhui Fan, Dong Ki Yoon, Min-Kyo Seo
Abstract: The dimensionality of vortical structures has recently been extended beyond two dimensions, providing higher-order topological characteristics and robustness for high-capacity information processing and turbulence control. The generation of high-dimensional vortical structures has mostly been demonstrated in classical systems through the complex interference of fluidic, acoustic, or electromagnetic waves. However, natural materials rarely support three- or higher-dimensional vortical structures and their physical interactions. Here, we present a high-dimensional gradient thickness optical cavity (GTOC) in which the optical coupling of planar metal-dielectric multilayers implements topological interactions across multiple dimensions. Topological interactions in high-dimensional GTOC construct non-trivial topological phases, which induce high-dimensional vortical structures in generalized parameter space in three, four dimensions, and beyond. These emergent high-dimensional vortical structures are observed under electro-optic tomography as optical vortex dynamics in two-dimensional real-space, employing the optical thicknesses of the dielectric layers as synthetic dimensions. We experimentally demonstrate emergent vortical structures, optical vortex lines and vortex rings, in a three-dimensional generalized parameter space and their topological transitions. Furthermore, we explore four-dimensional vortical structures, termed optical vortex sheets, which provide the programmability of real-space optical vortex dynamics. Our findings hold significant promise for emulating high-dimensional physics and developing active topological photonic devices.

Title: Molecular Mechanism Enabling Linearity and Symmetry in Neuromorphic Elements
Authors: Bidyabhusan Kundu, Sreetosh Goswami
Abstract: For over a decade, linear and symmetric weight updates have remained the elusive holy grail in neuromorphic computing. Here, we unveil a kinetically controlled molecular mechanism driving a near-ideal neuromorphic element, capable of precisely modulating conductance linearly across 16,500 analog levels spanning four orders of magnitude. Our findings, supported by experimental data and mathematical modelling, demonstrate how nonlinear processes such as nucleation can be orchestrated within small perturbation regimes to achieve linearity. This establishes a groundwork for routinely realizing these long-sought neuromorphic features across a broad range of material systems.

Title: Coherent control over the high-dimensional space of the nuclear spin of alkaline-earth atoms
Authors: Husain Ahmed, Andrea Litvinov, Pauline Guesdon, Etienne Maréchal, John H. Huckans, Benjamin Pasquiou, Bruno Laburthe-Tolra, Martin Robert-de-Saint-Vincent
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.

Title: In-operando control of sum-frequency generation in tip-enhanced nanocavities
Authors: Philippe Roelli, Isabel Pascual, Iris Niehues, Javier Aizpurua, Rainer Hillenbrand
Abstract: Sum-frequency generation (SFG) is a second-order nonlinear process widely used for characterizing surfaces and interfaces with monolayer sensitivity. Recently, optical field enhancement in plasmonic nanocavities has enabled SFG with continuous wave (CW) lasers from nanoscale areas of molecules, promising applications like nanoscale SFG spectroscopy and coherent upconversion for mid-infrared detection at visible frequencies. Here, we demonstrate CW SFG from individual nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) cavities, which are resonant at visible frequencies and filled with a monolayer of molecules, when placed beneath a metal scanning probe tip. The tip acts as an efficient broadband antenna, focusing incident CW infrared illumination onto the nanocavity. The cascaded near-field enhancement within the NPoM nanocavity yields nonlinear optical responses across a broad range of infrared frequencies, achieving SFG enhancements of up to 14 orders of magnitude. Further, nanomechanical positioning of the tip allows for in-operando control of SFG by tuning the local field enhancement rather than the illumination intensities. The versatility of tip-enhanced nanocavities allows for SFG studies of a wide range of molecular species in the few-molecule regime without the need for complex nanofabrication of doubly-resonant nanocavities. Our results also promise SFG nanoimaging with tips providing strong visible and IR field enhancement at their apex, offering a robust platform for future applications in nonlinear nanooptics.

Title: A stable phase-locking-free single beam optical lattice with multiple configurations
Authors: Yirong Wang, Xiaoyu Dai, Xue Zhao, Guangren Sun, Kuiyi Gao, Wei Zhang
Abstract: Optical lattices formed by interfering laser beams are widely used to trap and manipulate atoms for quantum simulation, metrology, and computation. To stabilize optical lattices in experiments, it is usually challenging to implement delicate phase-locking systems with complicated optics and electronics to reduce the relative phase fluctuation of multiple laser beams. Here we report a phase-locking-free scheme to implement optical lattices by passing a single laser beam through a prism with n-fold symmetric facets and large apex angles. The scheme ensures a stable optical lattice since the interference occurs among different deflected parts of a single laser beam without any moving component. Various lattice configurations, including a triangular lattice and a quasi-crystal lattice with ten-fold symmetry are demonstrated. In both cases, stability measurements show a change of lattice constant in less than 1.14%, and a drift of lattice position in less than 1.61%.

Title: A high-speed, high-resolution Transition Edge Sensor spectrometer for soft X-rays at the Advanced Photon Source
Authors: Orlando Quaranta, Don Jensen, Kelsey Morgan, Joel C. Weber, Jessica L. McChesney, Hao Zheng, Tejas Guruswamy, Jonathan Baldwin, Ben Mates, Nathan Ortiz, Johnathon Gard, Doug Bennet, Dan Schmidt, Lisa Gades, Antonino Miceli
Abstract: This project explores the design and development of a transition edge sensor (TES) spectrometer for resonant soft X- ray scattering (RSXS) measurements developed in collaboration between Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Soft X-ray scattering is a powerful technique for studying the electronic and magnetic properties of materials on a microscopic level. However, the lack of high-performance soft X-ray spectrometers has limited the potential of this technique. TES spectrometers have the potential to overcome these limitations due to their high energy resolution, high efficiency, and broad energy range. This project aims to optimize the design of a TES spectrometer for RSXS measurements and more generally soft X-ray spectroscopy at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) 29-ID, leading to improved understanding of advanced materials. We will present a detailed description of the instrument design and implementation. The spectrometer consists of a large array of approximately 250 high-speed and high-resolution pixels. The pixels have saturation energies of approximately 1 keV, sub-ms pulse duration and energy resolution of approximately 1 eV. The array is read out using microwave multiplexing chips with MHz bandwidth per channel, enabling efficient data throughput. To facilitate measurement of samples in situ under ultra-high vacuum conditions at the beamline, the spectrometer is integrated with an approximately 1 m long snout.

Title: Landau-Levich Scaling for Optimization of Quantum Dot Layer Morphology and Thickness for Enhanced Quantum-Dot Light-Emitting Diode Performance
Authors: Yiman Xu, Grant J. Dixon, Qing Xie, James F. Gilchrist, Brandi M. Cossairt, David S. Ginger, Elsa Reichmanis
Abstract: Quantum dot (QD) light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) are promising candidates for next-generation displays because of their high efficiency, brightness, broad color gamut, and solution-processability. Large-scale solution-processing of electroluminescent QLEDs poses significant challenges, particularly concerning the precise control of the active layer's thickness and uniformity. These obstacles directly impact charge transport, leading to current leakage and reduced overall efficiency. Blade-coating is a prevalent and scalable solution processing technique known for its speed and minimal waste. Additionally, it allows for continuous "roll-to-roll" processing, making it highly adaptable in various applications. In this study, we demonstrate the precise control of blade speed in the Landau-Levich regime to create a uniform QD emission layer, using a commercial CdSe/ZnS QD as a representative example. QDs assemble into different morphologies on glass and the underlying layers of the QLED device due to variations in interaction energy. The QD film thickness can be modified from monolayer to multilayer by adjusting blade speed, which can be predicted by fitting the Landau-Levich-Derjaguin theory. The optimal speed at 7 mm/s results in a QD film with a surface coverage of around 163% and low roughness (1.57 nm mean square height). The QLED external quantum efficiency (EQE) of approximately 1.5% was achieved using commercially available CdSe/ZnS QDs with low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), and an EQE of around 7% has been obtained using lab-made InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs having a solution PLQY of 74%. All-blade-coated CdSe-QLEDs are further demonstrated by adopting the optimized speed for the QD layer. This method demonstrates significant potential for developing low-cost, reproducible, and scalable QLED technologies with uniform emission characteristics and low-waste production.

Title: Dissociation of Adsorbates via Electronic Energy Transfer from Aromatic Thin Films
Authors: E. T. Jensen
Abstract: Photofragment translational spectroscopy has been used to characterize the photodissociation of CH$_3$I and CF$_3$I adsorbed on thin films of a variety of aromatic molecules, initiated by near-UV light. Thin films (nominally 10 monolayers) of benzene, five substituted benzenes and two naphthalenes have been employed to study systematic changes in the photochemical activity. Illumination of these systems with 248nm light is found to result in a dissociation process for the CH$_3$I and CF$_3$I mediated by initial absorption in the aromatic thin film, followed by electronic energy transfer (EET) to the dissociating species. The effective cross sections for dissociation are found to be substantially increased via this mechanism, by amounts that differ depending on the aromatic molecule thin film used, and is connected to the aromatic photabsorption profile. Distinctive translational energy distributions for the CH$_3$ and CF$_3$ photofragments are found to vary systematically for the different aromatic molecule thin film used, and are related to the aromatic molecule excited states. The CH$_3$ and CF$_3$ photofragment kinetic energy distributions found for the aromatic thin films suggest that the dissociation occurs via EET to the $^3Q_1$ excited state of CH$_3$I and CF$_3$I.

Title: Slow spatial migration can help eradicate cooperative antimicrobial resistance in time-varying environments
Authors: Lluís Hernández-Navarro, Kenneth Distefano, Uwe C. Täuber, Mauro Mobilia
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat and combating its spread is of paramount importance. AMR often results from a cooperative behaviour with shared protection against drugs. Microbial communities generally evolve in volatile environments and spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations, and environmental variability thus have significant impacts on AMR, whose maintenance in static environments is generally promoted by migration. Here, we demonstrate that this picture changes dramatically in time-fluctuating spatially structured environments. To this end, we consider a two-dimensional metapopulation model consisting of demes in which drug-resistant and sensitive cells evolve in a time-changing environment in the presence of a toxin against which protection can be shared. Cells migrate between neighbouring demes and hence connect them. When the environment varies neither too quickly nor too slowly, the dynamics is characterised by bottlenecks causing fluctuation-driven local extinctions, a mechanism countered by migration that rescues AMR. Through simulations and mathematical analysis, we investigate how migration and environmental variability influence the probability of resistance eradication. We determine the near-optimal conditions for the fluctuation-driven AMR eradication, and show that slow but non-zero migration speeds up the clearance of resistance and can enhance its eradication probability. We discuss our study's impact on laboratory-controlled experiments.

Title: Quasi-topological fractons: a 3D dipolar gauge theory
Authors: Erica Bertolini, Alberto Blasi, Nicola Maggiore
Abstract: We consider the theory of a generic rank-2 tensor field in three spacetime dimensions, which involves a symmetric tensor field transforming under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms, and a vector field, whose gauge transformation depends on a local vector parameter. The gauge fixing shows a non-trivial structure, and some non-intuitive possibilities are listed. Despite the fact that the theory is not topological, the energy-momentum tensor vanishes on-shell, which justifies the quasi-topological appellation we give to this theory. We show that the theory has three degrees of freedom. Moreover we find an interesting physical interpretation, which consists in a generalized planar electromagnetism and in the emergence of two vector charges with restricted mobility. These are typical fractonic behaviours which can be related to the so called traceless scalar and vector charge theories.

Title: Universality class of a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate far from equilibrium
Authors: SeungJung Huh, Koushik Mukherjee, Kiryang Kwon, Jihoon Seo, Simeon I. Mistakidis, H. R. Sadeghpour, Jae-yoon Choi
Abstract: Scale invariance and self-similarity in physics provide a unified framework to classify phases of matter and dynamical properties near equilibrium in both classical and quantum systems. This paradigm has been further extended to isolated many-body quantum systems driven far from equilibrium, where physical observables exhibit dynamical scaling with universal scaling exponents. Universal dynamics appear in a wide range of scenarios, including cosmology, quark-gluon matter, ultracold atoms, and quantum spin magnets. However, how universal dynamics depend on the symmetry of the underlying Hamiltonian in nonequilibrium systems remain an outstanding challenge. Here, we report on the classification of universal coarsening dynamics in a quenched two-dimensional ferromagnetic spinor Bose gas. We observe spatiotemporal scaling of spin correlation functions with distinguishable scaling exponents that characterize binary and diffusive fluids. The universality class of the coarsening dynamics is determined by the symmetry of the order parameter and the dynamics of the topological defects, such as domain walls and vortices. Our results provide a categorization of the universality classes of far from equilibrium quantum dynamics based on symmetry properties of the system.

Title: Generalized formulation for ideal light-powered systems through energy and entropy flow analysis Part1. Based on the first-order evaluation
Authors: Tetsuo Yabuki
Abstract: In this study, the theoretical maximum efficien $\eta_{max}$ and the Boltzmann factor for photosynthetic systems under irradiation with arbitrary photon flux density $n_\gamma(\lambda)$, solid angle $\Omega$, and degree of polarization P, are formulated in the most fundamental and general way through the energy and entropy flow analysis, using reversibility and the first-order evaluable condition by the photon number change which is a quasi-equilibrium condition between the radiation and the system, as essential conditions. The radiation temperature for monochromatic light in non-equilibrium, i.e. in non-blackbody radiation, obtained by the fundamental formulation of this study is found to agree with the conventional radiation temperature, often called the effective temperature, for a given photon flux density (light intensity), provided that {\Omega} and P of the radiation are 4$\pi$ and 0, respectively. The reason for this agreement is discussed in the final section. The formulation in this study allows quantitative analyses that are not possible with conventional radiation temperature. As examples, the formulation of $\eta_{max}$ taking into account entropy changes due to photochemical reactions such as glucose production by photosynthesis, and various quantities under irradiation at arbitrary $\Omega$ and P are presented. In Appendix C, a specific and rigorous proof, using elementary geometry, of the fact that the entropy of radiation diluted on its way from the Sun to the Earth does not increase and remains unchanged from its original value, until it is scattered by the Earth's atmosphere, which is guaranteed only in general terms by Liouville's theorem, is given.

Title: Linear-in-temperature conductance in two-dimensional electron fluids
Authors: Serhii Kryhin, Qiantan Hong, Leonid Levitov
Abstract: Linear temperature dependence of transport coefficients in metals is often ascribed to non-Fermi-liquid physics. Here we demonstrate the $T$-linear behavior of nonlocal conductivity in a clean 2D electron fluid, where carrier collisions assist conduction and lead to hydrodynamic transport with conductance rather than resistance growing with temperature. The key aspect is the occurrence of multiple hydrodynamic modes representing odd-parity modulations of the Fermi surface evolving in space and time. A cascade of such modes results in a linear $T$ dependence that extends to lowest temperatures, as well as a Kolmogorov-like fractional power $-5/3$ scaling of conductivity vs. wavenumber. These dependences provide a smoking gun for nonclassical hydrodynamics driven by such modes, expected to be generic for 2D electron fluids with simple near-circular Fermi surfaces.

Title: Back-action supercurrent diodes
Authors: Daniel Margineda, Alessandro Crippa, Elia Strambini, Laura Borgongino, Alessandro Paghi, Giorgio de Simoni, Lucia Sorba andYuri Fukaya, Maria Teresa Mercaldo, Carmine Ortix, Mario Cuoco, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: Back-action refers to a response that retro-acts on a system to tailor its properties with respect to an external stimulus. This effect is at the heart of many electronic devices such as amplifiers, oscillators, and sensors. Here, we demonstrate that back-action can be exploited to achieve non-reciprocal transport in superconducting circuits. In our devices, dissipationless current flows in one direction whereas dissipative transport occurs in the opposite direction. Supercurrent diodes presented so far rely on magnetic elements or vortices to mediate charge transport or external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry. Back-action solely turns a conventional reciprocal superconducting weak link with no asymmetry between the current bias directions into a rectifier, where the critical current amplitude depends on the bias sign. The self-interaction of the supercurrent stems from the gate tunability of the critical current in metallic and semiconducting systems, which promotes nearly ideal magnetic field-free rectification with selectable polarity.

Title: Scaling and data collapse of two-dimensional random singlet state in magnetic field
Authors: Chen Peng, Long Zhang
Abstract: Quenched randomness strongly affects properties of magnetic materials. Two-dimensional (2D) random singlet (RS) states emerge in random $J$-$Q$ model by destroying valence bond solid order with spatial randomness. We examine the 2D RS state in magnetic field with quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The magnetization and susceptibilities show power-law scaling with magnetic field at low temperature. Moreover, they show one-parameter scaling behavior with $B/T$, and the scaling functions are remarkably consistent with a phenomenological model of random spin pairs with a singular distribution of interactions. These universal scaling functions can be used to diagnose 2D RS states in experiments.

Title: Langevin equations and a geometric integration scheme for the overdamped limit of homogeneous rotational Brownian motion
Authors: Felix Höfling, Arthur V. Straube
Abstract: The translational motion of anisotropic or self-propelled colloidal particles is closely linked with the particle's orientation and its rotational Brownian motion. In the overdamped limit, the stochastic evolution of the orientation vector follows a diffusion process on the unit sphere and is characterised by an orientation-dependent ("multiplicative") noise. As a consequence, the corresponding Langevin equation attains different forms depending on whether Ito's or Stratonovich's stochastic calculus is used. We clarify that both forms are equivalent and derive them from a geometric construction of Brownian motion on the unit sphere, based on infinitesimal random rotations. Our approach suggests further a geometric integration scheme for rotational Brownian motion, which preserves the normalisation constraint of the orientation vector exactly. We show that a simple implementation of the scheme, based on Gaussian random rotations, converges weakly at order 1 of the integration time step, and we outline an advanced variant of the scheme that is weakly exact for an arbitrarily large time step. Due to a favourable prefactor of the discretisation error, already the Gaussian scheme allows for integration time steps that are one order of magnitude larger compared to a commonly used, ad hoc algorithm for rotational Brownian dynamics simulations. The discussion is restricted to time-homogeneous rotational Brownian motion (i.e., a single rotational diffusion constant), which is relevant for axisymmetric particles and also chemically anisotropic spheres such as self-propelled Janus particles.

Title: Exciton Condensation in Landau Levels of Quantum Spin Hall Insulators
Authors: Hong-Mao Peng, Zhan Wang, Long Zhang
Abstract: We theoretically study the quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) in a perpendicular magnetic field. In the noninteracting case, the QSHI with space inversion and/or uniaxial spin rotation symmetry undergoes a topological transition into a normal insulator phase at a critical magnetic field $B_{\rm c}$. The exciton condensation in the lowest Landau levels is triggered by Coulomb interactions in the vicinity of $B_{\rm c}$ at low temperature and spontaneously breaks the inversion and the spin rotation symmetries. We propose that the electron spin resonance spectroscopy with the ac magnetic field also aligned in the perpendicular direction can directly probe the exciton condensation order. Our results should apply to QSHIs such as the InAs/GaSb quantum wells and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.

Title: Biased ensembles of pulsating active matter
Authors: William D. Piñeros, Étienne Fodor
Abstract: We discover unexpected connections between packing configurations and rare fluctuations in dense systems of active particles subject to pulsation of size. Using large deviation theory, we examine biased ensembles which select atypical realizations of the dynamics exhibiting high synchronization in particle size. We show that the order emerging at high bias can manifest as distinct dynamical states featuring high to vanishing pulsation current. Remarkably, transitions between these states arise from changing the system geometry at fixed bias and constant density. We rationalize such transitions as arising from the change in packing configurations which, depending on box geometry, may induce highly ordered or geometrically frustrated structures. Furthermore, we reveal that a master curve in the unbiased dynamics, correlating polydispersity and current, helps predict the dynamical state emerging in the biased dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that deformation waves can propagate under suitable geometries when biasing with local order.

Title: Navier-Stokes equations for nearly integrable quantum gases
Authors: Maciej Łebek, Miłosz Panfil
Abstract: The Navier-Stokes equations are paradigmatic equations describing hydrodynamics of an interacting system with microscopic interactions encoded in transport coefficients. In this work we show how the Navier-Stokes equations arise from the microscopic dynamics of nearly integrable $1d$ quantum many-body systems. We build upon the recently developed hydrodynamics of integrable models to study the effective Boltzmann equation with collision integral taking into account the non-integrable interactions. We compute the transport coefficients and find that the resulting Navier-Stokes equations have two regimes, which differ in the viscous properties of the fluid. We illustrate the method by computing the transport coefficients for an experimentally relevant case of coupled $1d$ cold-atomic gases.

Title: Anomalous Polarization in One-dimensional Aperiodic Insulators
Authors: A.Moustaj, J.P.J. Krebbekx, C. Morais Smith
Abstract: By implementing a charge pumping scheme for one-dimensional aperiodic chains, we confirm the existence of topological phases in these systems whenever their finite-size realizations admit inversion symmetry. These phases are usually characterized by an anomalous edge response as a result of the bulk-boundary correspondence. We show that these signatures are all present in various chains, each representing a different class of structural aperiodicity: the Fibonacci quasicrystal, the Tribonacci quasicrystal, and the Thue-Morse chain. More specifically, we calculate three quantities: the Berry phase of the crystalline approximation of the finite-size systems, the polarization response to an inifintesimal static and constant electric field in systems with open boundary conditions, and the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum. We find that all of them provide signatures of a topologically nontrivial phase.

Title: Experimental identification of topological defects in 2D colloidal glass
Authors: Vinay Vaibhav, Arabinda Bera, Amelia C. Y. Liu, Matteo Baggioli, Peter Keim, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: Topological defects are singularities within a field that cannot be removed by continuous transformations. The definition of these irregularities requires an ordered reference configuration, calling into question whether they exist in disordered materials, such as glasses. However, recent work suggests that well-defined topological defects emerge in the dynamics of glasses, even if they are not evident in the static configuration. In this study, we reveal the presence of topological defects in the vibrational eigenspace of a two-dimensional experimental colloidal glass. These defects strongly correlate with the vibrational features and spatially correlate with each other and structural "soft spots", more prone to plastic flow. This work experimentally confirms the existence of topological defects in disordered systems revealing the complex interplay between topology, disorder, and dynamics.

Title: Stochastic thermodynamics of Fisher information
Authors: Pedro B. Melo, Sílvio M. Duarte Queirós, Welles A. M. Morgado
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stochastic thermodynamics of Fisher information (FI), meaning we characterize both the \textit{fluctuations} of FI, introducing a parastatistics of that quantity, and thermodynamic quantities. We introduce two initial conditions: an equilibrium initial condition and a minimum entropy initial condition, both under a protocol that drives the system to equilibrium. Its results indicate a dependence of the average FI on both the initial condition and path taken. Furthermore, the results point the chosen parameter directly affects the FI of thermodynamic quantities such as irreversible work and entropy, along with fluctuations of a stochastic FI. Last, we assess the further role of FI of the distribution of thermal quantities within the context of thermostatistical inequalities.

Title: Theory of spin and orbital charge conversion at the surface states of Bi_{1-x}Sb_x topological insulator
Authors: Armando Pezo, Jean-Marie George, Henri Jaffrès
Abstract: Topological insulators are quantum materials involving Time-reversal protected surface states(TSS) making them appealing candidates for the design of next generation of highly efficient spintronic devices. The very recent observation of large transient spin-charge conversion (SCC) and subsequent powerful THz emission from Co|Bi_{1-x}Sb_x bilayers clearly demonstrates such potentiality and feasibility for the near future. Amongst the exotic properties appearing in and at the surface of such quantum materials, spin-momentum locking (SML) and Rashba-Edelstein effects remain as key ingredients to effectively convert the spin degree of freedom into a charge or a voltage signal. In this work, we extend our analyses to the quantification of orbital momentum-locking and related orbital charge conversion effects in Bi_{0.85}Sb_{0.15} via orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects. In that sense, we will provide some clear theoretical and numerical insights implemented by multi-orbital and multi-layered tight-binding methods (TB) to clarify our recent experimental results obtained by THz-TDS spectroscopy.

Title: Phase-space localization at the lowest Landau level
Authors: Ben Craps, Marine De Clerck, Oleg Evnin, Maxim Pavlov
Abstract: We consider bosons with weak contact interactions in a harmonic trap and focus on states at the lowest Landau level. Motivated by the known nontrivial phase-space topography of the energy functional of the corresponding Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we explore Husimi distributions of quantum energy eigenstates in the classical phase space of the Schroedinger field. With interactions turned off, the energy levels are highly degenerate and the Husimi distributions do not manifest any particular localization properties. With interactions turned on, the degeneracy is lifted, and a selection of energy levels emerges whose Husimi distributions are localized around low-dimensional surfaces in the phase space.

Title: Entropy stabilized form chirality in curved rod nematics: structure and symmetries
Authors: Alexandros G. Vanakaras, Edward T. Samulski, Demetri J. Photinos
Abstract: Monte Carlo molecular simulations of curve-shaped rods show the propensity of such shapes to polymorphism revealing both smectic and polar nematic phases. The nematic exhibits a nanoscale modulated local structure characterized by a unique, polar, $\rm{C}_2$-symmetry axis that tightly spirals generating a mirror-symmetry-breaking orgnization of the achiral rods=form chirality. A comprehensive characterization of the polarity and its symmetries in the nematic phase confirms that the nanoscale modulation is distinct from the elastic deformations of a uniaxial nematic director in the twist-bend nematic phase. Instead it is shown that, analogous to the isotropic-to-nematic transition, entropy stabilizes the roto-translating polar director in the polar-twisted nematic phase. The conflation of macroscale form chirality in ferroelectric nematics with that in the twist-bend nematic stems from the misattribution of the nanoscale modulation in the lower temperature nematic ''$\rm{N_X}$ phase'' found in CB7CB dimers.

Title: Deformation of a one dimensional ferromagnetic domain wall due to double exchange interaction with a free electron system
Authors: K. Seremetas, X. Zotos
Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the energy and conductance of a Bloch or Néel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron system via a double exchange interaction. Minimization of the total energy indicates that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is generally deformed to a thin wall, while for magnetic field larger than the chemical potential tends towards wide walls. In contrast, for a double wall system the deformation is always towards wide walls. For the single as well as the double magnetic wall systems the conductance monotonically decreases with decreasing wall width. The energy and conductance are identical for Bloch and Néel magnetic domain walls within this prototype model.

Title: Mixing soft and rigid particles in a hopper: soft particles induce flow intermittency and avalanches
Authors: Saeed Alborzi, Sara M. Hashmi
Abstract: Instabilities and avalanches in granular flows represent hallmarks of failure: they can both disrupt industrial process flows and signal dangerous conditions, like those in grain silos and snowy mountaintops. We investigate intermittency and avalanches in the gravity-driven flow of granular materials through a quasi-2D hopper. Mixtures of rigid polypropylene and soft polyacrylamide particles flow through a hopper constriction. A combination of high-speed imaging, particle identification and tracking analyses enable us to measure quantities including particle velocities, outflow rates, the time intervals between consecutive particle exits, and the geometric properties of any temporary arches that form during a flow test. As the fraction of rigid particles increases in the mixture, the velocity of exiting particles increases. So too, however, does the probability of complete clogging. While soft particles exhibit slower velocities at the hopper exit, they also facilitate greater overall discharge rates. Simultaneously, the presence of soft particles induces both intermittency and avalanches in the flow. In this case, arches that could permanently block the flow are more likely to be temporary in nature. Interestingly, the identity of the particle that falls first from a temporary arch correlates linearly with the mixing fraction in the overall sample. That is, soft particles, despite their correlation with flow instabilities, are not significantly more likely to fall first from a temporary arch. Investigating the arch geometries suggests that the particle forming the largest bond angle with its neighbors is the one that causes an arch to fail, regardless of being soft or rigid.

Title: Hard rigid rods on Husimi lattices
Authors: Lucas R. Rodrigues, Tiago J. Oliveira, Jürgen F. Stilck
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic behavior of hard rigid rods of size $k$ (i.e., $k$-mers) on four- and six-coordinated Husimi lattices (HLs), respectively built with squares (square HL) and triangles (triangular HL). In both lattices, dimers ($k=2$) and trimers ($k=3$) only present a isotropic phase, whereas a isotropic-nematic transition is observed for $k \ge 4$. In the square HL, this transition is continuous and occurs at a critical \textit{monomer} activity which displays a nonmonotonic variation with $k$, while the critical \textit{rod} activity and density are always decreasing functions of $k$. The isotropic-nematic transition is discontinuous in the triangular HL, but the $k$-dependence of the coexistence activities and density is analogous to that found for the square case. No transition from the nematic to a high-density disordered phase is found in these HLs. In general, this scenario is very similar to that already observed for rods on the Bethe lattice, though the critical parameters obtained here are in most cases closer to those reported in the literature for the square and triangular lattices. The entropy per site of fully-packed rods is also investigated in detail in the triangular HL, where its value for dimers differs by only 0.7\% from the exact result for the triangular lattice.

Title: Honeycomb supersolid -- Dirac points and shear-instability induced crystal transitions
Authors: P. B. Blakie
Abstract: The honeycomb supersolid state is predicted to form in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate with a planar confining potential. Our results for its excitation spectrum reveal the gapless bands and the emergence of Dirac points at the Brillouin zone edge, manifesting as points where the second sound and transverse sound bands touch. The honeycomb supersolid has three sound speeds that we connect to its elastic parameters through hydrodynamic theory. From this analysis we find conditions where a shear instability occurs as the honeycomb rigidity disappears. This gives insight into the nonequilibrium dynamics following an interaction quench, where the honeycomb pattern melts and different crystal orders emerge.

Title: SFFT-Based Homogenization: Using Tensor Trains to Enhance FFT-Based Homogenization
Authors: Sascha H. Hauck, Matthias Kabel, Mazen Ali, Nicolas R. Gauger
Abstract: Homogenization is a key technique for approximating the macroscopic properties of materials with microscale heterogeneity. The FFT-based Homogenization method has gained widespread usage due to its computational efficiency and accuracy in handling complex microstructures. However, despite its advantages, the method is limited by speed and memory constraints, particularly when applied to high-resolution discretizations. These limitations affect its scalability and efficiency, especially in large-scale simulations or when dealing with highly detailed microstructures. These challenges arise from the fundamental reliance on the Fast Fourier Transform, which imposes inherent restrictions on further advancements. In this paper, we propose a novel SFFT-based Homogenization algorithm that utilizes a Quantized Tensor Train variant of the Quantum Fourier Transform. This method is tailored to the geometry under consideration and offers significant improvements in time complexity and memory efficiency compared to the traditional FFT-based approach while remaining executable on classical hardware. The method is applicable only if a suitable Quantized Tensor Train representation exists for the stiffness operator associated with the underlying geometry.

Title: Realizing Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov pairing driven topological Majorana zero modes and superconducting diode effect in helical Shiba chain
Authors: Sayak Bhowmik, Arijit Saha
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for the realization of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing in a helical Shiba chain subjected to an out-of-plane Zeeman field, analyzed through a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BDG) mean-field formalism approach. A chain of magnetic adatoms with helical spin texture deposited on the surface of a common $s$-wave superconductor, has emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Our study reveals the crucial role of finite momentum pairing of Cooper pairs in the form of FFLO state which also supports topological MZMs at the ends of the chain. Interestingly, we demonstrate that FFLO pairing facilitates non-reciprocal charge transport, giving rise to superconducting diode effect in Shiba chain where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken. Such diode effect stems directly from the asymmetric FFLO state. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between the richness of helical Shiba chain, the out-of-plane Zeeman field, and FFLO pairing in the emergence of MZMs and driving the diode effect. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and realization of topological superconducting devices with diode-like properties, potentially advancing technological applications in quantum computing and superconducting electronics.

Title: Discovery of an Ultra-Stable Antiferromagnetic Two-Dimensional CrF3 Phase with Anisotropic Quasi-1D Mechanical, Electronic, and Thermal Properties
Authors: Xin Chen, Fengyi Zhou, Yan Suo, Cheng Shao, Xu Cheng, Duo Wang, Biplab Sanyal
Abstract: We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies.

Title: External field induced metal-to-insulator transition in dissipative Hubbard model
Authors: Beomjoon Goh, Junwon Kim, Hongchul Choi, Ji Hoon Shim
Abstract: In this work, we develop a non-equilibrium steady-state non-crossing approximation (NESS-NCA) impurity solver applicable to general impurity problems. The choice of the NCA as the impurity solver enables both a more accurate description of correlation effects with larger Coulomb interaction and scalability to multi-orbital systems. Based on this development, we investigate strongly correlated non-equilibrium states of a dissipative lattice system under constant electric fields. Both the electronic Coulomb interaction and the electric field are treated non-perturbatively using dynamical mean-field theory in its non-equilibrium steady-state form (NESS-DMFT) with the NESS-NCA impurity solver. We validate our implementation using a half-filled single-band Hubbard model attached to a fictitious free Fermion reservoir, which prevents temperature divergence. As a result, we identify metallic and insulating phases as functions of the electric field and the Coulomb interaction along with a phase coexistence region amid the metal-to-insulator transition (MIT). We find that the MIT driven by the electric field is qualitatively similar to the equilibrium MIT as a function of temperature, differing from results in previous studies using the iterative perturbation theory (IPT) impurity solver. Finally, we highlight the importance of the morphology of a correlated system under the influence of an electric field.

Title: On the Wiedemann-Franz law violation in Graphene and quark-gluon plasma systems
Authors: Ashutosh Dwibedi, Subhalaxmi Nayak, Sathe Subodh Kiran, Sabyasachi Ghosh, Sesha Vempati
Abstract: A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in Heavy ion collisions (HIC) with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-hole plasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that the enthalpy per net carrier density emerges as a useful physical quantity determining the hydrodynamic domain's transport variables. Lorenz ratio is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized by temperature. In searching whether the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law is obeyed or violated by checking the Lorenz ratio as one or deviated from one, we find that the Lorenz ratio determined from the fluid-based framework will always be responsible for the violation of the WF law. The reason is the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per particle in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene, and QGP, both systems at low net charge density, exhibit WF law violation due to their fluid nature. However, graphene at high net charge density obeys the WF law, followed by metals with high Fermi energy or density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition of the graphene system from low to high-density domain. In this regard, the fluid or non-fluid aspect of QGP at high density is yet to be explored by future facilities like Compressed Baryonic matter (CBM) and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) experiments.

Title: Fluctuations of topological charges in two-dimensional classical Heisenberg model
Authors: Shan-Chang Tang, Yu Shi
Abstract: Binding and unbinding of vortices drives Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in two-dimensional XY model. Here we investigate whether similar mechanism works in two-dimensional Heisenberg model, by using the fluctuation of the topological charge inside a loop to characterize the nature of binding versus unbinding of defects. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the fluctuation is proportional to the perimeter of the loop at low temperatures while to the area of the loop at high temperatures, implying binding of the defects at low temperatures and unbinding at high temperatures.

Title: Properties and Applications of the Kirkwood-Dirac Distribution
Authors: David R. M. Arvidsson-Shukur, William F. Braasch Jr., Stephan De Bievre, Justin Dressel, Andrew N. Jordan, Christopher Langrenez, Matteo Lostaglio, Jeff S. Lundeen, Nicole Yunger Halpern
Abstract: Recent years have seen the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution come to the forefront as a powerful quasi-probability distribution for analysing quantum mechanics. The KD distribution allows tools from statistics and probability theory to be applied to problems in quantum-information processing. A notable difference to the Wigner function is that the KD distribution can represent a quantum state in terms of arbitrary observables. This paper reviews the KD distribution, in three parts. First, we present definitions and basic properties of the KD distribution and its generalisations. Second, we summarise the KD distribution's extensive usage in the study or development of measurement disturbance; quantum metrology; weak values; direct measurements of quantum states; quantum thermodynamics; quantum scrambling and out-of-time-ordered correlators; and the foundations of quantum mechanics, including Leggett-Garg inequalities, the consistent-histories interpretation and contextuality. We emphasise connections between operational quantum advantages and negative or non-real KD quasi-probabilities. Third, we delve into the KD distribution's mathematical structure. We summarise the current knowledge regarding the geometry of KD-positive states (the states for which the KD distribution is a classical probability distribution), describe how to witness and quantify KD non-positivity, and outline relationships between KD non-positivity, coherence and observables' incompatibility.

Title: Trapped-Ion Quantum Simulation of Electron Transfer Models with Tunable Dissipation
Authors: Visal So, Midhuna Duraisamy Suganthi, Abhishek Menon, Mingjian Zhu, Roman Zhuravel, Han Pu, Peter G. Wolynes, José N. Onuchic, Guido Pagano
Abstract: Electron transfer is at the heart of many fundamental physical, chemical, and biochemical processes essential for life. The exact simulation of these reactions is often hindered by the large number of degrees of freedom and by the essential role of quantum effects. Here, we experimentally simulate a paradigmatic model of molecular electron transfer using a multispecies trapped-ion crystal, where the donor-acceptor gap, the electronic and vibronic couplings, and the bath relaxation dynamics can all be controlled independently. By manipulating both the ground-state and optical qubits, we observe the real-time dynamics of the spin excitation, measuring the transfer rate in several regimes of adiabaticity and relaxation dynamics. Our results provide a testing ground for increasingly rich models of molecular excitation transfer processes that are relevant for molecular electronics and light-harvesting systems.

Title: Lindbladian dynamics with loss of quantum jumps
Authors: Yu-Guo Liu, Shu Chen
Abstract: The Lindblad master equation (LME) describing the Markovian dynamics of the quantum open system can be understood as the evolution of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian balanced with random quantum jumps. Here we investigate the balance-breaking dynamics by partly eliminating jumps from postselection experiments. To describe this dynamics, a non-linear Lindblad master equation (NLME) is derived from quantum trajectory method. However, the NLME shows significant advantages in analytical analysis over quantum trajectory method. Using the NLME, we classify the dynamics into two classes. In the trivial class, the process of reducing jumps is completely equivalent to weakening the coupling from the environment. In contrast, the nontrivial class presents more complex dynamics. We study a prototypical model within this class and demonstrate the existence of the postselected skin effect whose steady state is characterized by the accumulation of particles on one side. The steady-state distribution can be fitted by a scale-invariant tanh function which is different from the uniform distribution of LME. Furthermore, the NLME can give a reasonable framework for studying the interplay and competition between the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and dissipative terms. We show this by capturing the characteristics of the trajectory-averaged entanglement entropy influenced by non-Hermitian skin effect and Zeno effect in the model of postselected skin effect.

Title: Effective short distance interaction in Calogero-Sutherland quantum fluids
Authors: Federico L. Bottesi, Guillermo R. Zemba
Abstract: We consider the effective conformal field theory with symmetry W-infinity x W-infinity that describes the thermodynamic limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model. In the repulsive regime of the free fermion formulation, we identify an attractive interaction between opposite moving particle-hole pairs that dominates the short distance behavior and that is proposed as responsible for the destabilization of the ground state, leading to a new one of bosonic nature. The process is described by a Bogoliubov transformation of the free fermion bilinear operators into bosonic ones, preserving the form of the W-infinity algebra but decoupling the opposite chirality terms in the hamiltonian, as expected in the low energy limit. In coordinate space this interaction has a short range component that arises due to the quantum regularization of the theory. The described dynamical process may be considered as a mechanism of the emergence of the known charge and quantum statistics fractionalization of the low lying excitations of the theory, as predicted in both first and second quantization studies.

Title: A possible evidence of pion condensation
Authors: Wei Zhu, Yu-Chen Tang, Lei Feng, Feng-yao Hou
Abstract: This work demonstrates that once a large number of pion is condensed in a high-energy hadron collision, the gamma-ray spectrum from $\pi^0$ decay takes on a typical broken power-law shape, which has been documented in many astronomical observations, but we have not yet recognized it. We show that this pion condensation is caused by a large number of soft gluons condensed in protons.

Title: Protocols for Creating Anyons and Defects via Gauging
Authors: Anasuya Lyons, Chiu Fan Bowen Lo, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Ashvin Vishwanath, Ruben Verresen
Abstract: Creating and manipulating anyons and symmetry defects in topological phases, especially those with a non-Abelian character, constitutes a primitive for topological quantum computation. We provide a physical protocol for implementing the ribbon operators of non-Abelian anyons and symmetry defects. We utilize dualities, in particular the Kramers-Wannier or gauging map, which have previously been used to construct topologically ordered ground states by relating them to simpler states. In this work, ribbon operators are implemented by applying a gauging procedure to a lower-dimensional region of such states. This protocol uses sequential unitary circuits or, in certain cases, constant-depth adaptive circuits. We showcase this for anyons and defects in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ toric code and $S_3$ quantum double. The general applicability of our method is demonstrated by deriving unitary expressions for ribbon operators of various (twisted) quantum doubles.

Abstract: Here, we present the outcomes from the second Large Language Model (LLM) Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry, which engaged participants across global hybrid locations, resulting in 34 team submissions. The submissions spanned seven key application areas and demonstrated the diverse utility of LLMs for applications in (1) molecular and material property prediction; (2) molecular and material design; (3) automation and novel interfaces; (4) scientific communication and education; (5) research data management and automation; (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation; and (7) knowledge extraction and reasoning from scientific literature. Each team submission is presented in a summary table with links to the code and as brief papers in the appendix. Beyond team results, we discuss the hackathon event and its hybrid format, which included physical hubs in Toronto, Montreal, San Francisco, Berlin, Lausanne, and Tokyo, alongside a global online hub to enable local and virtual collaboration. Overall, the event highlighted significant improvements in LLM capabilities since the previous year's hackathon, suggesting continued expansion of LLMs for applications in materials science and chemistry research. These outcomes demonstrate the dual utility of LLMs as both multipurpose models for diverse machine learning tasks and platforms for rapid prototyping custom applications in scientific research.

Title: Millikelvin Nb nanoSQUID-embedded tuneable resonator fabricated with a neon focused-ion-beam
Authors: Jamie A. Potter, Laith Meti, Gemma Chapman, Ed Romans, John Gallop, Ling Hao
Abstract: SQUID-embedded superconducting resonators are of great interest due to their potential for coupling highly scalable superconducting circuits with quantum memories based on solid-state spin ensembles. Such an application requires a high-$Q$, frequency-tuneable resonator which is both resilient to magnetic field, and able to operate at millikelvin temperatures. These requirements motivate the use of a higher $H_{c}$ metal such as niobium, however the challenge then becomes to sufficiently reduce the operating temperature. We address this by presenting a monolithic Nb nanoSQUID-embedded resonator, where neon focused-ion-beam fabrication of the nanoSQUID results in a device displaying frequency tuneability at $T = 16$ mK. In order to assess the applicability of the device for coupling to small spin clusters, we characterise the flux sensitivity as a function of microwave drive power and externally applied magnetic field, and find that the noise is dominated by dielectric noise in the resonator. Finally, we discuss improvements to the device design which can dramatically improve the flux sensitivity, which highlights the promise of Nb SQUID-embedded resonators for hybrid superconductor-spin applications.

Title: Kramers-protected hardware-efficient error correction with Andreev spin qubits
Authors: Haoran Lu, Isidora Araya Day, Anton R. Akhmerov, Bernard van Heck, Valla Fatemi
Abstract: We propose an architecture for bit flip error correction of Andreev spins that is protected by Kramers' degeneracy. Specifically, we show that a coupling network of linear inductors results in a static Hamiltonian composed of the stabilizers of a bit flip code. Thereby, without detuning from the Kramers' point, reflectometry off a single coupled resonator accomplishes a projective measurement of multiple stabilizers. We further show how circuit-mediated spin couplings enable error correction operations and a complete set of logical quantum gates. The concept is experimentally feasible.

Abstract: We report on the development of a low-energy positron diffraction (LEPD) experimental station for surface structure analysis using a linac-based slow-positron beam. LEPD, the positron counterpart of low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), offers higher accuracy in surface structure determination. The station enables acquisition of LEPD I-V curves within a few hours, allowing measurements before surface degradation occurs. It consists of two ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chambers: one for sample preparation and the other for LEPD observations. The preparation chamber includes an Ar+ sputtering system, a triple-pocket electron beam evaporator, three gas introduction systems, additional user-configurable ports, and a LEED/Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) system. Sample manipulators enable rapid cooling, precise positioning, and orientation adjustments. In the preparation chamber, the manipulator also supports direct current heating up to 1200 °C. The sample holder is compatible with the LEPD station at SPF-A4 and the ARPES station at PF BL-13B, both located at the Tsukuba campus of the Institute of Materials Structure Science (IMSS), KEK. Design concepts and experimental demonstrations are presented.
