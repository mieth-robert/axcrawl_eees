Title: Theory of Linear Magnetoresistance in a Strange Metal
Authors: Jaewon Kim, Shubhayu Chatterjee
Abstract: A central puzzle in strongly correlated electronic phases is strange metallic transport, marked by $T$-linear resistivity and $B$-linear magnetoresistance, in sharp contrast with quadratic scalings observed in conventional metals. Here, we demonstrate that proximity to quantum critical points, a recurring motif in the phase diagrams of strange metal candidates, can explain both transport anomalies. We construct and solve a minimal microscopic model by coupling electronic excitations at the Fermi surface to quantum critical bosons via a spatially disordered Yukawa interaction, as well as static pinned domains of density wave order. The resultant transport relaxation rate scales as $k_B T/\hbar$ at low magnetic fields, and as an effective Bohr magneton $\tilde{\mu}_B B/\hbar$ at low temperatures. Further, the magnetoresistance in our model shows a scaling collapse upon rescaling the magnetic field and the resistance by temperature, in agreement with experimental observations.

Title: Identifying biases of the Majorana scattering invariant
Authors: Isidora Araya Day, Antonio L. R. Manesco, Michael Wimmer, Anton R. Akhmerov
Abstract: The easily accessible experimental signatures of Majorana modes are ambiguous and only probe topology indirectly: for example, quasi-Majorana states mimic most properties of Majoranas. Establishing a correspondence between an experiment and a theoretical model known to be topological resolves this ambiguity. Here we demonstrate that already theoretically determining whether a finite system is topological is by itself ambiguous. In particular, we show that the scattering topological invariant -- a probe of topology most closely related to transport signatures of Majoranas -- has multiple biases in finite systems. For example, we identify that quasi-Majorana states also mimic the scattering invariant of Majorana zero modes in intermediate-sized systems. We expect that the bias due to finite size effects is universal, and advocate that the analysis of topology in finite systems should be accompanied by a comparison with the thermodynamic limit. Our results are directly relevant to the applications of the topological gap protocol.

Title: Chiral vortex-line liquid of three-dimensional interacting Bose systems with moat dispersion
Authors: Bahar Jafari-Zadeh, Chenan Wei, Tigran A. Sedrakyan
Abstract: We formulate and investigate a novel quantum state, the Chiral Vortex-Line Liquid (CVLL), emerging in three-dimensional interacting Bose systems exhibiting moat-band dispersions. Such dispersions feature extensive degeneracy along closed manifolds in momentum space, significantly amplifying quantum fluctuations that suppress conventional Bose-Einstein condensation. By extending the two-dimensional Chern-Simons flux-attachment transformation to three dimensions through a combination of planar CS phases and Jordan-Wigner fermionization along vortex lines, we construct the CVLL state, characterized by nontrivial vortex-line excitations with topological properties. We develop an associated topological field theory in a curved spatial geometry and study the low-energy effective theory of the CVLL state. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we numerically determine the CVLL ground state's chemical potential for interacting bosons in cylindrical moat-band geometries and demonstrate that the CVLL phase energetically outcompetes traditional condensate phases at low densities, highlighting its relevance to experimental platforms including frustrated quantum magnets, ultracold atomic gases, physics of rotons in $^4$He, and moat regimes in heavy-ion collisions.

Title: Surfactants Screen Slide Electrification
Authors: Xiaomei Li, Zhongyuan Ni, Xiaoteng Zhou, Lisa S. Bauer, Diego Diaz, Gabriele Schäfer, Hans-Jürgen Butt
Abstract: Water drops spontaneously accumulate charges when they move on hydrophobic dielectric surfaces by slide electrification. On the one hand, slide electrification generates electricity with possible applications on tiny devices. On the other hand, the potential of up to 1 KV generated by slide electrification alters wetting and drop motion. Therefore, it is important to know the factors that affect slide electrification. To find out how surfactants affect slide electrification, we measured drop charges of aqueous drops containing cationic CTAB, anionic SDS and neutral C8E3 sliding on different hydrophobic surfaces. The result is: addition of surfactant significantly reduces the spontaneous charging of moving water drops. Based on zeta potential measurements, confocal microscopy of deposited surface-active dyes and drop impact studies, we propose that several factors contribute to this suppression of charge separation: (1) Surfactants tend to lower the contact angles, which reduces charge separation. (2) Surfactant adsorption at the solid-liquid interface can reduce the density of primary ions, particularly for anionic surfactants. (3) Anionic and neutral surfactants are mostly transferred to the liquid-air interface at the rear of the sliding drop, retaining primary ions within the drop. (4) Deposited cationic surfactant directly reduces the charge of the drop.

Title: Pressure-induced orbital reordering in Na$_2$CuF$_4$
Authors: Craig I. Hiley, Catriona A. Crawford, Craig L. Bull, Nicholas P. Funnell, Urmimala Dey, Nicholas C. Bristowe, Richard I. Walton, Mark S. Senn
Abstract: The high-pressure behaviour of Na$_2$CuF$_4$ is explored by powder neutron diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A first-order phase transition is observed to take place between 2.4 - 2.9 GPa, involving a reorientation of the Jahn-Teller (JT) long axes of the (CuF6) octahedra (and therefore the d$_{z^2}$ Cu orbitals), in agreement with our DFT calculations which suggest a transition at 2.8 GPa. The transition can be described as being between a state of ferro-orbital order and one of A-type antiferro-orbital order, reflecting a shift in the associated electronic instability from being in the zone-center to zone boundary of the first Brillouin zone of the parent structure, with pressure. This change results in a decoupling of magnitude of the associated Jahn-Teller distortion of the Cu-F bond lengths from the lattice strain. This scenario is supported by our observations that the compressibility of the pre-transition phase is highly anisotropic, whilst in the post-transition phase it becomes almost isotropic, and that we observed no further decrease of the magnitude the JT distortion up to 5 GPa, or melting of the OO in our DFT calculations up to at least 5 GPa.

Title: Creating mixed-phase states in cadmium sulfide by swift heavy ion irradiation
Authors: Aldo Artímez Peña, Nikita Medvedev
Abstract: CdS has broad applications in solar cells and radiation detectors. We study its response to irradiation with swift heavy ions and determine its damage thresholds. We apply a model combining the Monte Carlo code TREKIS-3 to simulate the kinetics of the electronic system and the molecular dynamics code LAMMPS to track the atomic reaction to the energy transfer. It is found that ion tracks in CdS differ between its zincblende and wurtzite phases in morphology and damage thresholds. The anisotropic wurtzite phase displays directional damage formation with transient hexagonal track shapes along the (001) plane. In contrast, zincblende CdS exhibits a more cylindrical damage distribution. High pressures near the ion path drive mass transport away from the melted region, forming cavities within the track core in the wurtzite phase. Although significant recrystallization is observed during post-irradiation relaxation, it does not fully restore the original phase: final tracks consist of the amorphous cores due to the low densities in this region and defect-containing crystalline halos. These findings suggest that ion irradiation could be used to create mixed-phase CdS-based materials.

Title: Silk: A promising natural blend of amino acids for efficient CO2 capture
Authors: Md Sariful Sheikh, Qiyuan Chen, Lijie Guo, Xudong Wang, Bu Wang
Abstract: In recent years, various highly porous solid sorbents have drawn a significant research interest as promising carbon capture material. Nevertheless, the issues of high synthesis cost, limited CO2 adsorption capacity, slow adsorption-desorption kinetics, high sorbent regeneration temperature, and poor operational stability remain challenges to overcome before their practical implementation. Herein, natural silk fibroin, a blend of various amino acids, could be a promising material to realize low-cost carbon capture technology due to its amine-like CO2 capture behavior, light weight, natural abundance, scalable processing, and biocompatibility. The mulberry silk-derived silk-fibroin aerogel with a high specific surface area demonstrates high CO2 adsorption capacity (~3.65 mmol CO2/gm sorbent at 0.15 atm CO2), which is competitive with state-of-the-art solid sorbents and surpasses all amino acid-based solid sorbents. The thermogravimetry analysis reveals that the thermal degradation temperature of silk-fibroin aerogel is around 250 oC, significantly higher than conventional amines used for carbon capture. Furthermore, the silk-fibroin-based sorbent demonstrates rapid adsorption-desorption kinetics, complete regeneration at a temperature as low as 60 oC, promising stability over multiple adsorption-desorption cycles, and maintaining its adsorption capacity under humid conditions. Overall, this study highlights natural silk's promising carbon capture potential, which is demanding further exploration.

Title: α-Ta (111) Thin Films for Qubit Applications: A Study of Thickness Dependence and Universal Scaling
Authors: Nate Price, Jose Gutiérrez, Sushant Padhye, Sara McGinnis, Carter Wade, Huma Yusuf, Lakshan Don Manuwelge Don, Kurt Eyink, J. Guerrero-Sánchez, Evgeny Mikheev, Joseph P. Corbett
Abstract: We explore the growth of {\alpha}-Ta thin films ranging from ultra-thin (2 nm) to thick (250 nm) films grown by sputter epitaxy on c-plane sapphire substrates. We utilized 100 W power with a 32 mTorr sputter pressure at 650 ° substrate deposition temperature. We used X-ray diffractometry to extract the lattice constant and growth orientation of the films, finding a mono-oriented (111) films with a lattice spacing in agreement with a bulk Ta value of 3.31 Å. X-ray reflectometry is used to characterize the native oxide, film, and substrate-film interface as a function of thickness. We observe a very smooth morphology with an average roughness of 700 pm, as determined by both reflectometry and atomic force microscopy. The film nucleates with small islands, whose terrace width grows linearly as a function of thickness until 150 nm, where the terrace width becomes constant. From our reflectometry measurements, we uncover a pseudomorphic layer with a critical thickness of 1 nm and a self-limiting amorphous oxide that grows to a thickness of 2.25 nm; both of these layers are independent of thickness beyond 4 nm total thickness. We also studied the superconducting transition through electronic transport measurements using the Van der Pauw method to measure resistivity as a function of temperature. We observed a smooth evolution in critical superconducting temperature with total film thickness, from 2.9 °K for 7.5 nm to 4.2 °K for 269.2 nm, as expected from universal thickness scaling in superconductors. Density functional theory simulations were used to understand the oxidation process at the top surface layers of {\alpha}-Ta (111). We observed that as the oxygen content on the surface increases, the Ta progressively loses its crystalline structure. Significant structural distortions occur when the Ta:O ratio exceeds 1:1, forming an amorphous TaO phase.

Title: Shaking and pushing skyrmions: Formation of a non-equilibrium phase with zero critical current
Authors: Felix Rucker, Alla Bezvershenko, Denis Mettus, Andreas Bauer, Markus Garst, Achim Rosch, Christian Pfleiderer
Abstract: In three-dimensional chiral magnets, skyrmions are line-like objects oriented parallel to the applied magnetic field. The efficient coupling of magnetic skyrmion lattices to spin currents and magnetic fields permits their dynamical manipulation. Here, we explore the dynamics of skyrmion lattices when slowly oscillating the field direction by up to a few degrees on millisecond timescales while simultaneously pushing the skyrmion lattice by electric currents. The field oscillations induce a shaking of the orientation of the skyrmion lines, leading to a phase where the critical depinning current for translational motion vanishes. We measure the transverse susceptibility of MnSi to track various depinning phase transitions induced by currents, oscillating fields, or combinations thereof. An effective slip--stick model for the bending and motion of the skyrmion lines in the presence of disorder explains main features of the experiment and predicts the existence of several dynamical skyrmion lattice phases under shaking and pushing representing new phases of matter far from thermal equilibrium.

Title: Indirect Excitons and Many-body Interactions in InGaAs Double Quantum Wells
Authors: Christopher L. Smallwood, Rachel Owen, Matthew W. Day, Takeshi Suzuki, Rohan Singh, Travis M. Autry, Smriti Bhalerao, Fauzia Jabeen, Steven T. Cundiff
Abstract: Spatially indirect excitons in semiconductor quantum wells are relevant to basic research and device applications because they exhibit enhanced tunability, delocalized wave functions, and potentially longer lifetimes relative to direct excitons. Here we investigate the properties of indirect excitons and their coupling interactions with direct excitons in asymmetric InGaAs double quantum wells using optical multidimensional coherent spectroscopy and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. Analyses of the spectra confirm a strong influence of many-body effects, and reveal that excited-state zero-quantum coherences between direct and indirect excitons in the quantum wells dephase faster than the much higher-energy single-quantum coherences between excitonic excited states and ground states. The results also suggest an important energy-dependent role of continuum states in mediating system dynamics, and they indicate that dephasing mechanisms are associated with uncorrelated or anticorrelated energy-level fluctuations.

Title: Quantitative approaches for multi-scale structural analysis with atomic resolution electron microscopy
Authors: Noah Schnitzer, Lopa Bhatt, Ismail El Baggari, Robert Hovden, Benjamin H. Savitzky, Michelle A. Smeaton, Berit H. Goodge
Abstract: Atomic-resolution imaging with scanning transmission electron microscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing the nanoscale structure of materials, in particular features such as defects, local strains, and symmetry-breaking distortions. In addition to advanced instrumentation, the effectiveness of the technique depends on computational image analysis to extract meaningful features from complex datasets recorded in experiments, which can be complicated by the presence of noise and artifacts, small or overlapping features, and the need to scale analysis over large representative areas. Here, we present image analysis approaches which synergize real and reciprocal space information to efficiently and reliably obtain meaningful structural information with picometer scale precision across hundreds of nanometers of material from atomic-resolution electron microscope images. Damping superstructure peaks in reciprocal space allows symmetry-breaking structural distortions to be disentangled from other sources of inhomogeneity and measured with high precision. Real space fitting of the wave-like signals resulting from Fourier filtering enables absolute quantification of lattice parameter variations and strain, as well as the uncertainty associated with these measurements. Implementations of these algorithms are made available as an open source Python package.

Title: Minimal pole representation for spectral functions
Authors: Lei Zhang, André Erpenbeck, Yang Yu, Emanuel Gull
Abstract: Representing spectral densities, real-frequency, and real-time Green's functions of continuous systems by a small discrete set of complex poles is an ubiquitous problem in condensed matter physics, with applications ranging from quantum transport simulations to the simulation of strongly correlated electron systems. This paper introduces a method for obtaining a compact, approximate representation of these functions, based on their parameterization on the real axis and a given approximate precision. We show applications to typical spectral functions and results for structured and unstructured correlation functions of model systems.

Title: Reset Induced Multimodality in Unbounded Potential
Authors: Karol Capała
Abstract: Resetting, as a protocol that restarts the evolution of a system, can significantly influence stochastic dynamics. One notable effect is the emergence of stationary states in unbounded potentials, where such states would otherwise be absent without resetting. In this work, we explore unbounded potentials for which resetting not only induces stationary states but also leads to their multimodality, despite the repulsive nature of the potential. We present examples of potentials that, despite lacking local minima, can generate trimodal and pentamodal states, and we investigate how the modal structure of these states varies with noise intensity and resetting frequency.

Title: Computational Study of Density Fluctuation-Induced Shear Bands Formation in Bulk Metallic Glasses
Authors: Siya Zhu, Hagen Eckert, Stefano Curtarolo, Jan Schroers, Axel van de Walle
Abstract: Seemingly identical Bulk Metallic Glasses (BMG) often exhibit strikingly different mechanical properties despite having the same composition and fictive temperature. A postulated mechanism underlying these differences is the presence of "defects". Here we investigate this hypothesis through the study of the effect of density fluctuations on shear band formation under an applied stress. We find that the critical shear stress is strongly dependent on the magnitude and size of the fluctuations. This finding also elucidates why, historically, critical shear stresses obtained in simulations have differed so much from those found experimentally, as typical simulations setups might favor unrealistically uniform geometries.

Title: TCNQ self-assembly driven by molecular coverage over borophene monolayers
Authors: G. H. Silvestre, R. H. Miwa
Abstract: Boron monolayers, also known as borophene, have recently attracted interest due to their electronic properties, e.g. the facility to form various allotropes with interesting properties. In this work, we investigate the adsorption process of the tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) on the borophene $\beta_{12}$ and $\chi_3$ using the density functional theory (DFT). We observed that molecules bond to the borophene layer through the van der Waals interaction, where, at the low coverage limit, the binding strength of TCNQ / borophene is comparable to that of TCNQ / WSe$_2$. By increasing the molecular coverage, $10^{13} \rightarrow 10^{14}$ molecules/cm$^{2}$, we found the (exothermic) formation of self-assembled (SA) structures of TCNQ on borophene, where the molecule-molecule interactions rule the SA process. The structural stability of the SA-TCNQ molecule on borophene was verified via ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, we show that the formation of the vdW interface leads to the tunability of the hole-doping of the borophene layer by an external electric field. We believe that our results bring an important contribution to the atomic-scale understanding of a powerful electron acceptor molecule, TCNQ, adsorbed on a promising 2D material, borophene.

Title: Hydrodynamics of the electronic Fermi liquid: a pedagogical overview
Authors: Aaron Hui, Brian Skinner
Abstract: For over a hundred years, electron transport in conductive materials has been primarily described by the Drude model, which assumes that current flow is impeded primarily by momentum-relaxing collisions between electrons and extrinsic objects such as impurities or phonons. In the past decade, however, experiments have increasingly realized ultra-high quality electronic materials that demonstrate a qualitatively distinct method of charge transport called hydrodynamic flow. Hydrodynamic flow occurs when electrons collide much more frequently with each other than with anything else, and in this limit the electric current has long-wavelength collective behavior analogous to that of a classical fluid. While electron hydrodynamics has long been postulated theoretically for solid-state systems, the plethora of recent experimental realizations has reinvigorated the field. Here, we review recent theoretical and experimental progress in understanding hydrodynamic electrons using the (hydrodynamic) Fermi liquid as our prototypical example.

Title: Multicriticality in stochastic dynamics protected by self-duality
Authors: Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Luke Causer, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We study the dynamical large deviations (LD) of a class of one-dimensional kinetically constrained models whose (tilted) generators can be mapped into themselves via duality transformations. We consider four representative models in detail: the domain-wall (DW) Fredrickson-Andersen (FA), the DW East, the ZZZ-FA, and the XOR-FA models. Using numerical tensor networks, we build the LD phase diagrams of these models in terms of the softness of the constraint and the counting field conjugate to the dynamical activity. In all cases, we find distinct dynamical phases separated by phase transitions along the self-dual lines, revealing the presence of multi-critical points that delimit first-order from continuous active-inactive transitions. We discuss connections to supersymmetry and possible extensions to higher spin and space dimensions.

Title: Bayesian critical points in classical lattice models
Authors: Adam Nahum, Jesper Lykke Jacobsen
Abstract: The Boltzmann distribution encodes our subjective knowledge of the configuration in a classical lattice model, given only its Hamiltonian. If we acquire further information about the configuration from measurement, our knowledge is updated according to Bayes' theorem. We examine the resulting "conditioned ensembles", finding that they show many new phase transitions and new renormalization-group fixed points. (Similar conditioned ensembles also describe "partial quenches" in which some of the system's degrees of freedom are instantaneously frozen, while the others continue to evolve.) After describing general features of the replica field theories for these problems, we analyze the effect of measurement on illustrative critical systems, including: critical Ising and Potts models, which show surprisingly rich phase diagrams, with RG fixed points at weak, intermediate, and infinite measurement strength; various models involving free fields, XY spins, or flux lines in 2D or 3D; and geometrical models such as polymers or clusters. We make connections with quantum dynamics, in particular with "charge sharpening" in 1D, by giving a formalism for measurement of classical stochastic processes: e.g. we give a purely hydrodynamic derivation of the known effective field theory for charge sharpening. We discuss qualitative differences between RG flows for the above measured systems, described by $N\to 1$ replica limits, and those for disordered systems, described by $N\to 0$ limits. In addition to discussing measurement of critical states, we give a unifying treatment of a family of inference problems for non-critical states. These are related to the Nishimori line in the phase diagram of the random-bond Ising model, and are relevant to various quantum error correction problems. We describe distinct physical interpretations of conditioned ensembles and note interesting open questions.

Title: Low-energy structure and topology of the two-band Hubbard-Kanamori model
Authors: Nayara G. Gusmão, Germán Blesio, Armando Aligia, Walber H. Brito, Maria C. O. Aguiar, Karen Hallberg
Abstract: We investigate the Mott transition in a two-band Hubbard-Kanamori model using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) with the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and the Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) as impurity solvers. Our study focuses on the case where the intraorbital and interorbital Coulomb interactions are equal (U = U2) and the Hund's coupling is absent (J = 0). Spectral analysis confirms the absence of an orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT), even in systems with significantly different bandwidths (t1 and t2 for the wide and narrow bands, respectively), indicating a simultaneous Mott transition in both bands. Notably, the NRG results reveal the emergence of a pseudo-gap-like feature and a central peak in the narrow band, whose characteristics depend on the hopping parameter t2. These spectral features may serve as precursors to OSMT in more realistic systems with finite Hund's coupling (J > 0). Furthermore, in the Mott insulating phase, the self-energies of both bands diverge, suggesting that the Mott transition represents a topological phase transition. Our results highlight the crucial role of accurate impurity solvers in capturing the density of states and detailed spectral structures.

Title: Triplet superconductivity by the orbital Rashba effect at surfaces of elemental superconductors
Authors: Tom G. Saunderson, Dongwook Go, Maria Teresa Mercaldo, Mario Cuoco, Mathias Kläui, James F. Annett, Martin Gradhand, Jacob Gayles, Yuriy Mokrousov
Abstract: It is often assumed that in a superconductor without spin-triplet pairing, the formation of unconventional spin-triplet densities requires the spin-orbit interaction in combination with either broken inversion symmetry or broken time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show from first principles the existence of supercurrent-driven spin triplet densities on the surface of a variety of simple superconducting materials without spin-orbit coupling. We are able to attribute this phenomenon to the superconducting non-relativistic orbital Rashba Edelstein effect. Furthermore, we find that the spin-orbit induced spin moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the orbital moment, and has a vanishing effect on the total magnitude of the induced triplet density. Our findings imply the existence of a route to generate spin-currents without the use of heavy metals. Additionally, as an orbital moment can couple directly to a magnetic field, it shows that orbital physics is the dominant term that drives the superconducting diode effect.

Title: Energy Bands and Breakdown Characteristics in Al2O3/UWBG AlGaN Heterostructures
Authors: Seungheon Shin, Kyle Liddy, Yinxuan Zhu, Chandan Joishi, Brianna A. Klein, Andrew Armstrong, Andrew A. Allerman, Siddharth Rajan
Abstract: We report on energy bands and breakdown characteristics of Al2O3 dielectrics on ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructures. Metal-dielectric-semiconductor structures are important to sustain high fields needed for future high-performance UWBG transistors. Using systematic experiments, we determined the fixed charge density (> 1013 cm-2), the dielectric/interface, and electric fields in the oxide of under flat-band conditions in the semiconductor. Low gate-to-drain leakage current of up to 5 x 10-7 A/cm2 were obtained in the metal-oxide-semiconductor structures. In lateral metal-semiconductor-insulator test structures, breakdown voltage exceeding 1 kV was obtained with a channel sheet charge density of 1.27 x 1013 cm-2. The effective peak electric field and average breakdown field were estimated to be > 4.27 MV/cm and 1.99 MV/cm, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of Al2O2 integration for enhancing the breakdown performance of UWBG AlGaN HEMTs.

Abstract: Weyl semimetals have attracted significant interest in condensed matter physics and materials science, due to their unique electronic and topological properties. These characteristics not only deepen our understanding of fundamental quantum phenomena, but also make Weyl semimetals promising candidates for advanced applications in electronics, photonics, and spintronics. This review provides a systematic overview of the field, covering theoretical foundations, material synthesis, engineering strategies, and emerging device applications. We first outline the key theoretical principles and distinctive properties of Weyl semimetals, followed by an examination of recent advancements that enhance their functional versatility. Finally, we discuss the critical challenges hindering their practical implementation and explore future development directions, along with the potential for expanding and enhancing their existing range of applications. By integrating discussions of both opportunities and obstacles, this review offers a balanced perspective on current progress and future directions in Weyl semimetal research.

Title: Robustness of ferromagnetism in van der Waals magnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ to hydrostatic pressure
Authors: Yonglin Wang, Xu-Tao Zeng, Bo Li, Cheng Su, Takanori Hattori, Xian-Lei Sheng, Wentao Jin
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT) holds a great potential for applications in spintronic devices, due to its high Curie temperature, easy tunability, and excellent structural stability in air. Theoretical studies have shown that pressure, as an external parameter, significantly affects its ferromagnetic properties. In this study, we have performed comprehensive high-pressure neutron powder diffraction (NPD) experiments on FGT up to 5 GPa, to investigate the evolution of its structural and magnetic properties with hydrostatic pressure. The NPD data clearly reveal the robustness of the ferromagnetism in FGT, despite of an apparent suppression by hydrostatic pressure. As the pressure increases from 0 to 5 GPa, the Curie temperature is found to decrease monotonically from 225(5) K to 175(5) K, together with a dramatically suppressed ordered moment of Fe, which is well supported by the first-principles calculations. Although no pressure-driven structural phase transition is observed up to 5 GPa, quantitative analysis on the changes of bond lengths and bond angles indicate a significant modification of the exchange interactions, which accounts for the pressure-induced suppression of the ferromagnetism in FGT.

Title: Decoupled anisotropic Charge-Phonon Transport Enables Exceptional n-Type Thermoelectric Performance in CuBiSCl$_2$
Authors: Yu Wu, Ying Chen, Shuming Zeng, Liujiang Zhou, Chenhan Liu
Abstract: First-principles calculations demonstrate an exceptional decoupling of charge and thermal transport along the \textit{a}-axis in CuBiSCl$_2$. The material achieves superior electron mobility (138 cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s at 300 K) through delocalized Bi-6\textit{p}/S-3\textit{p} networks while maintaining ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (0.40 W/mK at 300 K) via Cu-dominated anharmonic phonon scattering - both optimized along the same crystallographic direction. This simultaneous optimization originates from the anisotropic bonding hierarchy where [BiSCl$_2$]$_n$ ribbons enable efficient charge transport along \textit{a}-axis, while the soft vibrational modes associated with Cu atoms strongly scatter heat-carrying phonons. The resulting high power factor (1.71 mW/mK$^2$ at 700 K) and peak \textit{ZT} of 1.57 establish CuBiSCl$_2$ as a model system that realizes the long-sought "phonon glass-electron crystal" paradigm through crystallographically engineered transport channels.

Title: Plasmonic Crystals with Tunable Band Gaps in the Grating Gate Transistor Structures
Authors: G. R. Aizin, J. Mikalopas, M. Shur
Abstract: We developed a hydrodynamic model of plasmonic crystals formed in the current-driven grating gate transistor structures. The model demonstrates that the quality factor of plasmonic resonances could be increased by using ungated regions with high electron densities connecting multiple plasmonic cavities. The analytical and numerical calculations of the EM radiation absorption by the band plasmons show that the drive current makes all plasma modes optically active by breaking the symmetry of the plasma oscillations. This effect results in splitting plasmon resonant absorption peaks revealing the gaps in the plasmonic band spectrum tunable by current. The analyzed design could achieve resonant behavior at room temperature for plasmonic crystals implemented in various material systems, including graphene, III-V, III-N materials, and p-diamond. We argue that the resulting double-peak spectrum line in the terahertz range also facilitates the absorption at the gap frequency, typically in microwave range. Power pumping at the gap frequency enables excitation of the gap plasmons, promoting frequency conversion from microwave to THz ranges. The flexibility in the length of the ungated region for the investigated structures allows for an effective coupling with THz radiation, with the metal grating acting as a distributive resonant antenna. The applications of the presented results extend to THz communication systems, THz sensing and imaging, frequency conversion systems, and other advanced THz plasmonic devices.

Title: Topological delocalization against Anderson localization observed in Bi-doped PbSb2Te4 disordered topological insulator
Authors: Yuya Hattori, Koichiro Yaji, Keisuke Sagisaka, Shunsuke Yoshizawa, Shunsuke Tsuda, Yuki Tokumoto, Taichi Terashima, Shinya Uji, Keiichi Edagawa
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the tendency of localization in the bulk and the topological surface states in topological insulators Pb(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 (x=0.793-0.818) through detailed transport measurements. The bulk electronic states in the range 0.793<=x<0.818 are situated on the insulator side of the Anderson transition, as indicated by k_Fl values (where k_F is the Fermi wavenumber and l is the mean free path) falling below the Ioffe-Regel criterion (i.e., k_F l<1). In contrast, the topological surface states retain high mobility and even exhibit quantum oscillations, demonstrating their resilient nature against strong disorder. These findings highlight the delocalized nature of the topological surface states despite Anderson localization of the bulk electronic states.

Title: Subcritical Pitchfork Bifurcation Transition of a Single Nanoparticle in Strong Confinement
Authors: Jeongmin Kim, Bong June Sung
Abstract: Confinement influences fluid properties. We show, employing molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvents, that slit confinement drives a first-order transition for a small nanoparticle between staying at the slit center and binding to the slit surfaces. The transition follows a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation, accompanying a similar transition of the nanoparticle's lateral diffusion, depending on interparticle interactions and confinement interfaces. Our findings underscore the necessity for advancing molecular hydrodynamics under strong confinement.

Title: Double unstable avoided crossings and complex domain patterns formation in spin-orbit coupled spin-1 condensates
Authors: Sanu Kumar Gangwar, Rajamanickam Ravisankar, Henrique Fabrelli, Paulsamy Muruganandam, Pankaj Kumar Mishra
Abstract: We analyze the impact of spin-orbit and Rabi couplings on the dynamical stability of spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates for ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions. Determining the collective excitation spectrum through Bogoliubov-de-Gennes theory, we characterize the dynamical stability regime via modulational instability. For AFM interactions, the eigenspectrum reveals the presence of both stable and unstable avoided crossings (UAC), with the first-excited branch undergoing a double unstable avoided crossing. In contrast, with ferromagnetic interactions, only a single UAC, which occurs between the low-lying and first-excited branches, is observed. Furthermore, the eigenvectors demonstrate the transition from density-like to spin-like behaviour, as the collective excitation shows the transition from stable to unstable mode for both the FM and AFM interactions. In the multi-band instability state, eigenvectors display spin-density mixed mode, while they show spin-flip nature in the avoided crossing regime. Our analysis suggests that spin-orbit coupling enhances the instability gain, while Rabi coupling plays the opposite role. Finally, we corroborate our analytical findings of stable and unstable regimes through numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of the condensates by introducing the perturbations upon quenching the trap strength. The dynamical phases show the formation of complex domains with AFM interaction, which may be attributed to the double unstable avoided crossings in such a system.

Title: A steady solution to the hydrodynamic equation and incommensurate magnetization in a U(2) invariant superfluid
Authors: Guang-Xin Pang, Yi-Cai Zhang
Abstract: At the zero temperature limit, a one-dimensional steady solution to the hydrodynamic equation of a U(2) invariant superfluid is obtained. This solution reveals that the magnitude of magnetization is always directly proportional to the particle number density. Furthermore, the problem can be interpreted as a particle's motion in a central force field. It is demonstrated that the particle's orbits are elliptical in shape, with a precession angle determined by a non-zero mass current. This suggests that the spatial periods of the three component magnetizations are not commensurate. These findings indicate that the coupling of mass superflow and magnetization distortions usually results in an incommensurate magnetization.

Title: Temperature and misorientation-dependent austenite nucleation at ferrite grain boundaries in a medium manganese steel: role of misorientation-dependent grain boundary segregation
Authors: Rama Srinivas Varanasi, Osamu Waseda, Faisal Waqar Syed, Prithiv Thoudden-Sukumar, Baptiste Gault, Jörg Neugebauer, Dirk Ponge
Abstract: In the current work, we study the role of grain boundary (GB) misorientation-dependent segregation on austenite nucleation in a 50% cold rolled intercritically annealed 10Mn-0.05C-1.5Al (wt. %) medium Mn steel. During intercritical annealing at 500°C, austenite nucleates predominantly at high-angle GBs. At 600°C, austenite nucleates additionally at low-angle GBs, exhibiting a temperature dependance. Correlative transmission Kikuchi diffraction /atom probe tomography reveals a misorientation-dependent segregation. While GB segregation has been reported to assist austenite nucleation in medium manganese steels (3-12 wt.% Mn), an understanding of the temperature and misorientation dependance is lacking, which is the aim of current work. Since artifacts of atom probe can cause a broadening of the segregation width, we combined experiments with results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations that reveal that the Mn segregation is not limited to the GB plane but confined to a region in the range of approximately 1 nm. Consequently, GB segregation alters both the GB interface energy and the free energy per unit volume corresponding to the transformation. We estimate the local driving force for austenite nucleation accounting for the segregation width of ~ 1 nm. Based on classical nucleation theory, we clarify the effect of GB segregation on the critical radius and activation energy barrier for confined austenite nucleation at the GB.

Title: Fate of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Paired Phase in Coupled $XY$ Models
Authors: Tianning Xiao, Youjin Deng, Xiao-Yu Dong
Abstract: Intriguing phases may emerge when two-dimensional systems are coupled in a bilayer configuration. In particular, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) paired superfluid phase was predicted and claimed to be numerically observed in a coupled $XY$ model with ferromagnetic interlayer interactions, as reported in [\href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 100601 (2019)}]. However, both our Monte Carlo simulations and analytical analysis show that this model does not exhibit a BKT paired phase. We then propose a new model incorporating four-body interlayer interactions to realize the BKT paired phase. Moreover, we observe that the anomalous magnetic dimension varies along the phase transition line between the disordered normal phase and the BKT paired phase. This finding requires an understanding beyond the conventional phase transition theory.

Title: Mechanisms of Dual-Band Emission in Sb-Doped Rare-Earth Phosphates Revealed
Authors: Ruijie Hao, Xin Zhao, Chang-Kui Duan
Abstract: The Sb$^{3+}$ ion has garnered significant interest due to its effectiveness in boosting the optical properties of host materials. Among the interesting phenomena is the commonly observed dual-band emission, which has often been interpreted by adopting the phenomenological model that explains the dual-band emission (``ultraviolet band'' and ``visible band'') in Sb-doped $L$PO$_{4}$ ($L$ = Sc, Y, Lu). However, the model for Sb-doped $L$PO$_{4}$ series itself has not been well understood theoretically. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations combined with group-theory analysis to clarify the underlying physical mechanism behind dual-band emission in Sb-doped $L$PO$_{4}$ series. We demonstrate that the dual-band arises from two excited-state equilibrium structures, one exhibits a relatively small distortion with respect to the ground-state equilibrium structure, while the other displays a significantly larger distortion, characteristic of an ``off-center'' configuration. The deviations from the ground-state configuration are dominated by two distinct vibrational modes, $b_2$ and $e$ modes, involving the Jahn-Teller effect and the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect, respectively. Furthermore, charge transition levels and energy barriers calculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method have aided in understanding the relaxation between the two excited-state configurations and the property changes across the Sc, Y, and Lu series. These insights provide a basis for understanding the exotic properties of Sb$^{3+}$ in other hosts and may facilitate the design of optical materials in a broader range of systems involving Sb$^{3+}$ ions.

Title: Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor artificial graphene
Authors: Gökhan Öztarhan, Paweł Potasz, A. D. Güçlü
Abstract: We present the emergence of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor-based artificial graphene using high-precision variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, complemented by exact diagonalization calculations of the extended Hubbard model. Specifically, we analyze a realistic model of an armchair hexagonal geometry comprising $42$ lattice sites, nanopatterned on GaAs quantum wells with nearest-neighbor distance of $a = 50$ nm. Our results reveal a distinct magnetic phase transition near $U/t \approx 60$ driven by the absence/addition of a single electron at half-filling where the ferromagnetic phase is further stabilized by Coulomb scattering terms.

Title: In-situ compression and shape recovery of Ceramic single grain micro-pillar
Authors: Justin Jetter, Eckhard Quandt
Abstract: Most ceramic materials are known for high fracture toughness while reacting highly brittle to physical deformation. Some advancements were made by utilizing the transformation toughening effect of Yttria-doped Zirconia. However, finding a ceramic material demonstrating an effect analogous to the Shape Memory Effect (SME) in certain metals, that also allows for superelastic responses, remains a challenge. The underlying mechanism for SME and superelasticity is based on crystallographic variations within the material's grains, requiring sophisticated electron microscopy techniques for direct observation. The combination of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with focused ion beam (FIB) milling, a Kleindiek Nanotechnik GmbH micro-manipulator with a 1.5 $\mu$m diamond tip, and the ability to achieve in-situ heating up to 450 °C on a Kleindiek heating stage provides a robust platform for the preparation, deformation, and heating of micro-pillars made from ceramic materials. This setup enabled us to conduct detailed studies on the Zirconia-based ceramic, observing permanent deformation exceeding 4% strain, followed by shape recovery at 370 °C. The paper provides outlines the key experimental steps that facilitated these observations.

Title: Surface forces and frictional properties of adsorbed bio-based cationic polysaccharide thin films in salted aqueous medium
Authors: Lionel Bureau, Simon Trouille, Gustavo S Luengo
Abstract: Inter-surface forces mediated by polymer films are important in a range of technological and industrial situations. In cosmetics, applications such as hair conditioning typically rely on the adsorption of polyelectrolyte films onto the charged surface of hair fibers, whose contact mechanics and tribological properties are central in determining the final sensorial perceptions associated with the cosmetic treatment. A major current challenge to be tackled by the cosmetic industry is to design high-performance products employing bio-sourced polyelectrolytes, with the aim of achieving eco-sustainable processes and products. In this context, the present study focuses on the mechanical properties of thin films obtained by adsorption from solution of fungal chitosan onto negatively charged mica surfaces. We use a Surface Forces Apparatus allowing for the simultaneous measurement of film thickness and friction force as a function of the applied normal load and shear velocity. We show that, in aqueous medium at an ionic strength of 40 mM, adsorbed films of chitosan give rise to repulsive inter-surface forces whose range, comparable to the Flory radius of the macromolecules, increases with the polymer molecular weight. In addition, the adsorbed layers are found to behave, under compressive forces, as pseudo-brushes of neutral polymers. Finally, we show that under shear forces, chitosan layers exhibit a transition from a low to a high friction regime under increasing confinement.

Title: Laser Annealing of Transparent ZnO Thin Films: A Route to Improve Electrical Conductivity and Oxygen Sensing Capabilities
Authors: A. Frechilla, J. Frechilla, L. A. Angurel, F. Toldra-Reig, E. Martinez, G. F. de La Fuente, D. Munoz-Rojas
Abstract: The chemical deposition of high-performance Zinc Oxide (ZnO) thin films is challenging, thus significant efforts have been devoted during the past decades to develop cost-effective, scalable fabrication methods in gas phase. This work demonstrates how ultra-short-pulse Laser Beam Scanning (LBS) can be used to modulate electrical conductivity in ZnO thin films deposited on soda-lime glass by Spatial Atomic Layer Deposition (SALD), a high-throughput, low-temperature deposition technique suitable for large-area applications. By systematically optimizing laser parameters, including pulse energy and hatching distance, significant improvements in the electrical performance of 90 nm-thick ZnO films were achieved. The optimization of the laser annealing parameters, 0.21 uJ/pulse energy and a 1 micron hatching distance, yielded ZnO films with an electrical resistivity of (9 +- 2) 10-2 Ohm cm, 3 orders of magnitude lower than as deposited films. This result suggests that laser post-deposition-processing can play an important role in tailoring the properties of ZnO thin films. Excessive laser intensity can compromise structural integrity of the films, however, degrading their electrical transport properties. Notably, the electrical resistance of laser-annealed ZnO films exhibited high sensitivity to oxygen concentration in the surrounding atmosphere, suggesting exciting prospects for application in devices based on transparent oxygen sensors. This study thus positions ultra-short pulsed laser annealing as a versatile post-deposition method for fine-tuning the properties of ZnO thin films, enabling their use in advanced optoelectronic and gas-sensing technologies, particularly on temperature-sensitive substrates.

Title: Accelerating the discovery of high-performance nonlinear optical materials using active learning and high-throughput screening
Authors: Victor Trinquet, Matthew L. Evans, Gian-Marco Rignanese
Abstract: Due to their abundant use in all-solid-state lasers, nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are needed for many applications across diverse fields such as medicine and communication. However, because of conflicting requirements, the design of suitable inorganic crystals with strong second-harmonic generation (SHG) has proven to be challenging to both experimentalists and computational scientists. In this work, we leverage a data-driven approach to accelerate the search for high-performance NLO materials. We construct an extensive pool of candidates using databases within the OPTIMADE federation and employ an active learning strategy to gather optimal data while iteratively improving a machine learning model. The result is a publicly accessible dataset of $\sim$2,200 computed SHG tensors using density-functional perturbation theory. We further assess the performance of machine learning models on SHG prediction and introduce a multi-fidelity correction-learning scheme to refine data accuracy. This study represents a significant step towards data-driven materials discovery in the NLO field and demonstrates how new materials can be screened in an automated fashion.

We identify Se-deficient MoSe$_2$ (followed by WSe$_2$) nanosheets to be favorable for selective methanol formation.

Title: Fully ergodic simulations using radial updates
Authors: Finn L. Temmen, Evan Berkowitz, Anthony Kennedy, Thomas Luu, Johann Ostmeyer, Xinhao Yu
Abstract: A sensible application of the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method is often hindered by the presence of large - or even infinite - potential barriers. These potential barriers separate the configuration space into distinct sectors and can lead to ergodicity violations that bias measurements. In this work, we address this problem by augmenting HMC with a multiplicative Metropolis-Hastings update in a so-called ''radial direction'' of the fields which enables crossing the potential barriers and ensures ergodicity of the sampling algorithm at comparably low computational cost. We demonstrate the algorithm on a simple toy model and show how it can be applied to the fermionic Hubbard model describing physics ranging from an exactly-solvable two-site system to the $C_{20}H_{12}$ perylene molecule. Our numerical results show that the radial updates successfully remove ergodicity violations, while simultaneously reducing autocorrelation times.

Title: Strong Nonlinear Flexoelectricity in Bulk Ferroelectrics
Authors: Yingzhuo Lun, Yida Yang, Tingjun Wang, Qi Ren, Sang-Wook Cheong, Xueyun Wang, Jiawang Hong
Abstract: Flexoelectricity induced by strain gradient in dielectrics is highly desirable for electromechanical actuating and sensing systems. It is broadly adopted that flexoelectric polarization responds linearly to strain gradient without considering nonlinearity. Consequently, the implication of nonlinear flexoelectricity in electromechanical systems remains unclear. Herein, we establish a nonlinear constitutive model for flexoelectricity and thereby propose a strategy for quantitatively measuring its nonlinearity through the high-order harmonic generations. A strong nonlinear flexoelectricity in bulk ferroelectrics is revealed and its coefficient is determined, as evidenced by their nonlinear dependence of harmonics on strain gradient. On this basis, we illustrate the nonlinear flexoelectricity manifests a functionality to transduce mixed mechanical excitations into coherent electrical signals featuring difference- and sum-frequencies, thereby offering utilization in signal processing for frequency conversion. These findings emphasize the significance of nonlinear flexoelectricity in ferroelectrics and open up new opportunities for designing electromechanical transducer based on nonlinear flexoelectricity.

Title: Shape transitions of sedimenting confined droplets and capsules: from oblate to bullet-like geometries
Authors: Danilo P. F. Silva, Rodrigo C. V. Coelho, Ariel Dvir, Noa Zana, Margarida M. Telo da Gama, Naomi Oppenheimer, Nuno A. M. Araujo
Abstract: The transport and deformation of confined droplets and flexible capsules are central to diverse phenomena and applications, from biological flows in microcapillaries to industrial processes in porous media. We combine experiments and numerical simulations to investigate their shape dynamics under varying levels of confinement and particle flexibility. A transition from an oblate to a bullet-like shape is observed at a confinement threshold, independent of flexibility. A fluid-structure interaction analysis reveals two regimes: a pressure-dominated and a viscous-dominated regime. For highly flexible particles, the pressure-dominated regime prevails and the deformation is enhanced. These findings offer new insights into the transport of flexible particles in confined environments, with implications for biomedical applications, filtration technologies, and multiphase fluid mechanics.

Title: Higher-order topological phases for time-reversal-symmetry breaking superconductivity in UTe$_2$
Authors: Yuki Yamazaki, Shingo Kobayashi
Abstract: The recent discovery of heavy-fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ has broadened the possibility of realizing exotic time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity. However, a comprehensive understanding of the topological phases in the superconducting states of UTe$_2$ is still lacking. Here, we present an exhaustive classification of topological phases for all time-reversal symmetry breaking pairing symmetries of UTe$_2$. Using the K theoretical classification approach, we uncover that 25 out of 36 possible pairing states are classified as higher-order topological phases, with some demonstrating hybrid-order topology through an intricate interplay of hinge and corner states. Furthermore, under the weak-coupling condition of the pair potentials, the possible pairing symmetries are constrained to $B_{ju} + i B_{ku}$, $A_{u} + i B_{j u}$, and $B_{j g} + iA_u$ ($j,k = 1,2,3$; $j \neq k$), where these symbols denote the irreducible representations of the point group $D_{2h}$. For these pairing states, the topological invariants are related to the Fermi surface topology via the Fermi-surface formula, enabling us to systematically diagnose higher-order topological phases. Using a tight-binding model, we demonstrate the higher-order topological phases of the mixed-parity $A_u + iB_{1g}$ superconductors, where the second-order and hybrid-order topological phases emerge as the number of Fermi surfaces enclosing the time-reversal invariant momentum evolves from two to four. The findings suggest that UTe$_2$ serves as a compelling platform for exploring higher-order topological superconductors with diverse topological surface states.

Title: KTaO3(001) Preparation Methods in Vacuum: Effects on Surface Stoichiometry, Crystallography, and in-gap States
Authors: Andrea M. Lucero Manzano, Esteban D. Cantero, Emanuel A. Martínez, F. Y. Bruno, Esteban A. Sánchez, Oscar Grizzi
Abstract: KTaO3 single crystals with different orientations are used as substrates for the epitaxial growth of thin films and/or as hosts for two-dimensional electron gases. Due to the polar nature of the KTaO3(001) surface, one can expect difficulties and challenges to arise in its preparation. Maintaining good insulating characteristics without adding undesirable in-gap electronic states, obtaining good crystalline order up to the top surface layer, a sufficiently flat surface, and complete cleanliness of the surface (without water, C or OH contaminants), are in general difficult conditions to accomplish simultaneously. Cleaving in vacuum is likely the best option for obtaining a clean surface. However, since KTaO3 is cubic and lacks a well-defined cleavage plane, this method is notsuitable for sample growth or reproducible device fabrication. Here, we systematically evaluate the effect of typical preparation methods applied on the surfaces of KTaO3(001) single crystals. In particular, we used annealing in vacuum at different temperatures, light sputtering with Ar+ ions at low energy (500 eV) followed by annealing, heavy Ar+ ion bombardment and annealing, and grazing Ar+ ion bombardment under continuous azimuthal rotation combined with both annealing in vacuum and in O2 atmosphere. Possible side effects after each treatment are evaluated by a combination of techniques, including low-energy ion scattering at forward angles, Auger electron spectroscopy, low-energy electron energy loss, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and time of flightsecondary ion mass spectrometry. Advantages and shortcomings of each preparation method are discussed in detail.

Title: Expanding the Horizons of Phase Transition-Based Luminescence Thermometry
Authors: M. Tahir Abbas, M. Szymczak, V. Kinzhybalo, D. Szymanski, M. Drozd, L. Marciniak
Abstract: The limited operational range of phase transition-based luminescence thermometers necessitates the exploration of new host materials exhibiting first-order structural phase transitions to broaden the applicability of this approach. Addressing this need, the present study investigates the spectroscopic properties of as a function of temperature. A thermally induced structural transition from the low-temperature orthorhombic phase to the high-temperature trigonal phase, occurring at approximately 430 K, significantly alters the spectroscopic properties of Eu3 ions. Specifically, a reduction in the number of Stark lines due to changes in the point symmetry of Eu3 ions enables the development of a ratiometric luminescence thermometer with sensitivity as high as K. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that increasing the concentration of Eu3 ions shifts the phase transition temperature, allowing for modulation of the thermometric performance of this luminescence thermometer. The findings presented here not only expand the repertoire of phase transition-based luminescence thermometers but also illustrate how the luminescence properties of Eu3 ions can be employed to accurately monitor structural changes in the host material.

Title: High-Chern-number Quantum anomalous Hall insulators in mixing-stacked MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ thin films
Authors: Jiaheng Li, Quansheng Wu, Hongming Weng
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators are characterized by vanishing longitudinal resistance and quantized Hall resistance in the absence of an external magnetic field. Among them, high-Chern-number QAH insulators offer multiple nondissipative current channels, making them crucial for the development of low-power-consumption electronics. Using first-principles calculations, we propose that high-Chern-number ($C>1$) QAH insulators can be realized in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) multilayer films through the combination of mixed stacking orders, eliminating the need for additional buffer layers. The underlying physical mechanism is validated by calculating real-space-resolved anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). Local AHC is found to be predominantly located in regions with consecutive correct stacking orders, contributing to quasi-quantized AHC. Conversely, regions with consecutive incorrect stacking contribute minimally to the total AHC, which can be attributed to the varied interlayer coupling in different stacking configurations. Our work provides valuable insights into the design principle for achieving large Chern numbers, and highlights the role of stacking configurations in manipulating electronic and topological properties in MBT films and its derivatives.

Title: NIR-to-NIR ratiometric and lifetime based luminescence thermometer on a structural phase transition in Na3Sc2(PO4)3:Yb3+
Authors: Anam Javaid, Maja Szymczak, Malgorzata Kubicka, Justyna Zeler, Vasyl Kinzhybalo, Marek Drozd, Damian Szymanski, Lukasz Marciniak
Abstract: The ratiometric approach is the most commonly employed readout technique in luminescence thermometry. To address the trade-off between the risk of measurement disturbance in thermometers with high spectral separation of emission bands (due to dispersion in the surrounding medium) and the low sensitivity observed in ratiometric thermometers based on Stark level thermalization, we propose a thermometer based on the structural phase transition in . The use of Yb3+ ions as dopants and the changes in Stark level energies associated with the thermally induced monoclinic-to-trigonal phase transition enable the development of a thermometer with high relative sensitivity, achieving at 340K for N. Additionally, as demonstrated, the structural transition alters the probability of radiative depopulation of the 2F5/2 state of Yb3+, allowing the development of a lifetime-based luminescence thermometer. Furthermore, the phase transition temperature and consequently the thermometric performance of can be modulated by varying the Yb3+ ion concentration, offering additional tunability for specific applications.

Title: Shape Anisotropy Enabled Field Free Switching of Perpendicular Nanomagnets
Authors: Akanksha Chouhan, Heston A. Mendonca, Abhishek Erram, Ashwin A. Tulapurkar
Abstract: Spin Orbit Torque-Magnetic Random Access Memory (SOT-MRAM) is being developed as a successor to the Spin transfer torque MRAM (STT-MRAM) owing to its superior performance on the metrics of reliability and read-write speed. SOT switching of perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnet in the heavy metal/ferromagnet bilayer of SOT-MRAM unit cell requires an additional external magnetic field to support the spin-orbit torque generated by heavy metal to cause deterministic switching. This complexity can be overcome if an internal field can be generated to break the switching symmetry. We experimentally demonstrate that by engineering the shape of ferromagnet, an internal magnetic field capable of breaking the switching symmetry can be generated, which allows for deterministic switching by spin-orbit torques. We fabricated nanomagnets of Cobalt with triangular shape on top of Platinum and showed external magnetic field free switching between the two stable states of magnetization by application of nano-second voltage pulses. The experimental findings are consistent with the micro-magnetic simulation results of the proposed geometry.

Title: Control of Andreev Reflection via a Single-Molecule Orbital
Authors: Lorenz Meyer, Jose L. Lado, Nicolas Néel, Jörg Kröger
Abstract: Charge transport across a single-molecule junction fabricated from a normal-metal tip, a phthalocyanine, and a conventional superconductor in a scanning tunneling microscope is explored as a function of the gradually closed vacuum gap. The phthalocyanine (2H-Pc) molecule and its pyrrolichydrogen-abstracted derivative (Pc) exhibit vastly different behavior. Andreev reflection across the 2H-Pc contact exhibits a temporary enhancement that diminishes with increasing conductance. The hybridization of 2H-Pc with the tip at contact formation gives rise to a Kondo-screened molecular magnetic moment. In contrast, the single-Pc junction lacks Andreev reflection in the same conductance range. Spectroscopies and supporting nonequilibrium Green function calculations highlight the importance of a molecular orbital close to the Fermi energy for Andreev reflection.

Title: Controlling photo-excited electron-spin by light-polarization in ultrafast-pumped altermagnets
Authors: Amir Eskandari-asl, Jorge I. Facio, Oleg Janson, Adolfo Avella, Jeroen van den Brink
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) constitute a novel class of spin-compensated materials in which the symmetry connecting opposite-spin sublattices involves a spatial rotation. Here, we uncover a set of unique non-linear, light-driven properties that set AMs apart from traditional ferro- and antiferromagnets. We demonstrate theoretically that the polarization of an electromagnetic pulse that photo-excites electrons and holes in an AM, controls the spin orientation of these non-equilibrium charge carriers. For a d-wave AM model and a prototype material, we show that very large post-pump spin polarizations may be attained by exploiting resonances. We show that this protocol also allows, in an AM, to directly probe the spin splitting of the electronic states in energy and momentum space. Thus, it can be used to identify and characterize altermagnetic materials via ultrafast pump-probe Kerr/Faraday spectroscopy or spin- and time-resolved ARPES. This opens up the possibility of devising ultrafast optical switches of non-equilibrium spin-polarization, finely tunable by adjusting the pump-pulse characteristics.

Title: Scaling in Magnetic Neutron Scattering
Authors: Venus Rai, Andreas Michels
Abstract: We report the discovery of scaling in the mesoscale magnetic microstructure of bulk ferromagnets. Supported by analytical micromagnetic theory, we introduce the field-dependent scaling length $l_{\mathrm{C}}(H)$, which describes the characteristic long-wavelength magnetization fluctuations that are caused by microstructural defects by means of magnetoelastic and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The scaling length $l_{\mathrm{C}}$ is identified to consist of the micromagnetic exchange length of the field $l_{\mathrm{H}}$, which depends on the magnetic interactions, and a field-independent contribution that reflects the properties of the magnetic anisotropy field and the magnetostatic fluctuations. The latter finding is rooted in the convolution relationship between the grain microstructure and micromagnetic response functions. We validated the scaling property by analyzing experimental data for the magnetic neutron scattering cross section. When plotted as a function of the dimensionless scaled scattering vector $\mathfrak{q}(H) = q \, l_{\mathrm{C}}(H)$, the field-dependent amplitude-scaled neutron data of nanocrystalline Co and a Nd-Fe-B-based nanocomposite collapse onto a single master curve, demonstrating universal behavior. The scaling length $l_{\mathrm{C}}$ provides a framework for analyzing the field-dependent neutron scattering cross section, highlighting the existence of critical length scales that govern the mesoscale microstructure of magnetic materials.

Title: Introduction to dimensional reduction of fermions
Authors: Joel Hutchinson, Dmitry Miserev, Daniel Loss, Jelena Klinovaja
Abstract: We present a comprehensive pedagogical introduction to the dimensional reduction protocol (DRP), a versatile framework for analyzing instabilities and critical points in interacting fermionic systems. The DRP simplifies the study of many-body problems by systematically reducing their effective spatial dimension while retaining essential physics. This method works for electron gases in a diverse array of settings: in any number of spatial dimensions, in the presence of Zeeman fields, with spin-orbit coupling, including repulsive or attractive interactions. Focusing on two-point correlation functions, the DRP identifies a minimal subspace relevant for capturing analytic properties, facilitating efficient computation of critical phenomena in electronic systems. This work outlines the assumptions, proof, and applications of the DRP, emphasizing its simplicity and broad applicability for future studies in correlated electron physics.

Title: An anisotropic functional for two-dimensional material systems
Authors: Michael Lorke
Abstract: Density function theory is the workhorse of modern electronic structure theory. However, its accuracy in practical calculations is limited by the choice of the exchange-correlation potential. In this respect, 2D materials pose a special challenge, as all 2D materials and their heterostructures have a crucial similarity. The underlying atomic structures are strongly spatially inhomogeneous, implying that current exchange-correlation functionals, that in almost all cases are isotropic, are ill-prepared for an accurate description. We present an anisotropic screened-exchange potential, that remedies this problem and reproduces the band-gap of 2D materials as well as the piecewise linearity of the total energy with fractional occupation number.

Title: Toroid, Altermagnetic and Noncentrosymmetric ordering in metals
Authors: V.P.Mineev
Abstract: The article is dedicated to the 60th anniversary of the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics and is a review of normal and superconducting properties of toroidal, altermagnetic and noncentrosymmetric metals. Metals with toroidal order are compounds with an electron spectrum that is asymmetric with respect to the reflection of the momentum. An electric current propagating through samples of such a material causes its magnetization. Superconducting states in toroidal metals are a mixture of singlet and triplet pair states. Superconductivity is gapless even in ideal crystals without impurities. Altermegnets are antiferromagnetic metals that have a specific splitting of electron bands determined by symmetry. In this respect, they are similar to metals whose symmetry does not have a spatial inversion operation. Both of these types of materials have an anomalous Hall effect. A current propagating through a noncentrosymmetric metal causes magnetization, but this is not the case in altermagnets. On the other hand, in altermagnets there is a specific piezomagnetic Hall effect. Superconducting pairing in non-centrosymmetric metals occurs between electrons occupying states in one zone, whereas in altermagnets we are dealing with interband pairing, which is unfavorable for the formation of a superconducting state.

Title: How chiral vibrations drive molecular rotation
Authors: Ivan Pasqua, Gregorio Staffieri, Michele Fabrizio
Abstract: We analyze two simple model planar molecules: an ionic molecule with D3 symmetry and a covalent molecule with D6 symmetry. Both symmetries allow the existence of chiral molecular orbitals and normal modes that are coupled to each other in a Jahn-Teller manner, invariant under U (1) symmetry with generator a pseudo angular momentum. In the ionic molecule, the chiral mode possesses an electric dipole but lacks physical angular momentum, whereas, in the covalent molecule, the situation is reversed. In spite of that, we show that in both cases the chiral modes can be excited by a circularly polarized light and are subsequently able to induce rotational motion of the entire molecule. We further discuss the potential extension of our findings to the case of crystalline bulk samples.

Title: The protein escape process at the ribosomal exit tunnel has conserved mechanisms across the domains of life
Authors: Phuong Thuy Bui, Trinh Xuan Hoang
Abstract: The ribosomal exit tunnel is the primary structure affecting the release of nascent proteins at the ribosome. The ribosomal exit tunnels from different species have elements of conservation and differentiation in structural and physico-chemical properties. In this study, by simulating the elongation and escape processes of nascent proteins at the ribosomal exit tunnels of four different organisms, we show that the escape process has conserved mechanisms across the domains of life. Specifically, it is found that the escape process of proteins follows the diffusion mechanism given by a simple diffusion model and the median escape time positively correlates with the number of hydrophobic residues and the net charge of a protein for all the exit tunnels considered. These properties hold for twelve distinct proteins considered in two slightly different and improved Gō-like models. It is also found that the differences in physico-chemical properties of the tunnels lead to quantitative differences in the protein escape times. In particular, the relatively strong hydrophobicity of the E. coli's tunnel and the unusually high number of negatively charged amino acids on the tunnel's surface of H. marismortui lead to substantially slower escapes of proteins at these tunnels than at those of S. cerevisisae and H. sapiens.

Title: High-Yield Assembly of Plasmon-Coupled Nanodiamonds \textit{via} DNA Origami for Tailored Emission
Authors: Niklas Hansen, Jakub Copak, Marek Kindermann, David Roesel, Federica Scollo, Ilko Bald, Petr Cigler, Vladimira Petrakova
Abstract: Controlling the spatial arrangement of optically active elements is crucial for the advancement of engineered photonic systems. Color centers in nanodiamond offer unique advantages for quantum sensing and information processing; however, their integration into complex optical architectures is limited by challenges in precise and reproducible positioning, as well as efficient coupling. DNA origami provides an elegant solution, as demonstrated by recent studies showcasing nanoscale positioning of fluorescent nanodiamonds and plasmonic gold nanoparticles. Here, we present a scalable and robust method for covalently functionalizing nanodiamonds with DNA, enabling high-yield, spatially controlled assembly of diamond and gold nanoparticles onto DNA origami. By precisely controlling the interparticle spacing, we reveal distance-dependent modulation of NV center photoluminescence with a 10-fold increase in the fastest decay pathway at short interparticle distances. Our findings indicate selective plasmon-driven effects and interplay between radiative and non-radiative processes. This work overcomes key limitations in current nanodiamond assembly strategies and provides insights into engineering NV photoluminescence by plasmonic coupling that advance toward quantum photonic and sensing applications.

Abstract: The discovery of the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ has generated significant interest in its complex physical properties, particularly its superconducting behavior under different pressures, though its nature remains debated. Here, we performed low-temperature, high-pressure $^{121/123}$Sb nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to explore the superconducting pairing symmetry in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. At ambient pressure, we found that the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/$T_1$ exhibits a kink at $T \sim$ 0.4 $T_\textrm{c}$ within the superconducting state and follows a $T^3$ variation as temperature further decreases. This suggests the presence of two superconducting gaps with line nodes in the smaller one. As pressure increases beyond $P_{\rm c} \sim 1.85$ GPa, where the charge-density wave phase is completely suppressed, 1/$T_1$ shows no Hebel-Slichter peak just below $T_\textrm{c}$, and decreases rapidly, even faster than $T^5$, indicating that the gap is fully opened for pressures above $P_{\rm c}$. In this high pressure region, the angular dependence of the in-plane upper critical magnetic field $H_{\rm c2}$ breaks the $C_6$ rotational symmetry. We propose the $s+id$ pairing at $P > P_{\rm c}$ which explains both the 1/$T_1$ and $H_{\rm c2}$ behaviors. Our findings indicate that CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is an unconventional superconductor and its superconducting state is even more exotic at high pressures.

Title: A quantitative theory and atomistic simulation study on the soft-sphere crystal-melt interfacial properties: II. Interfacial free energies
Authors: Ya-Shen Wang, Zun Liang, Brian B. Laird, Yang Yang
Abstract: This study proposes a new method for predicting the crystal-melt interfacial free energy ($\gamma$) using the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model, enhanced by atomistic simulation data for more accurate density wave profiles. The analysis focuses on the soft-sphere system governed by an inverse power potential that stabilizes both BCC and FCC phases. Equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to obtain density wave amplitude distributions, which serve as inputs for the GL model to predict $\gamma$ and its anisotropy. The predicted $\gamma$ values exhibit strong agreement with prior benchmark simulation experimental studies, particularly for FCC crystal-melt interfaces (CMIs). The GL models for the CMI $\gamma$ are proved to be both computationally efficient and reasonably valid, offering quantitative predictions of $\gamma$ while providing insights into the factors controlling its magnitude and anisotropy. Key improvement is suggested for the variational procedure used in the two-mode CMI free energy functionals, and potential upgrades to the GL model are also proposed to further enhance predictive accuracy.

Title: How to Reliably Measure Carrier Mobility in Highly Resistive Lead Halide Perovskites with Photo-Hall Experiment
Authors: Soumen Kundu, Yeswanth Pattipati, Krishnamachari Lakshmi Narasimhan, Sushobhan Avasthi
Abstract: Mobility measurements in highly resistive methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) are challenging due to high impedance, ion drift, and low mobility. We show that we can address the challenge using intensity-dependent photo-Hall measurements. The key is an improved photo-Hall setup, which enables reliable Hall measurements in the dark and under low-intensity illumination. By tuning the illumination over four orders of magnitude, we get the additional information to simultaneously extract hole mobility, electron mobility, and background doping. For the first time, we show that a MAPI single crystal, exhibiting n-type behaviour in the dark, can show p-type behaviour under light due to the difference in hole and electron mobility. The data partly explains the variability in mobility reported in the literature. We show that one can erroneously extract any mobility from 0 to 25 cm2/Vs if we restrict the experiment to a small range of illumination intensities. For our MAPI (310) crystal, the measured hole and electron mobility is 40 cm2/Vs and 25.5 cm2/Vs, respectively.

Title: Topological Feature of Real-time Fisher Zeros
Authors: Yuchen Meng, Yang Liu, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou
Abstract: There are numerous methods to characterize topology and its boundary zero modes, yet their statistical mechanical properties have not received as much attention as other approaches. Here, we investigate the Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics of topological models, revealing that boundary zero modes can be described by an overlooked real-time Fisher zero pairing effect. This effect is validated in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Kitaev chain model, with the latter exhibiting a Fisher zero braiding picture. Topological zero modes exhibit robustness even when non-Hermiticity is introduced into the system and display characteristics of imaginary-time crystals when the energy eigenvalues are complex. We further examine the real-time Fisher zeros of the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, which maps to the Kitaev chain. We present a fractal picture of the Fisher zeros, illustrating how interactions eliminate topology. The mechanism of zero-pairing provides a natural statistical mechanical approach to understanding the connection between topology and many-body physics.

Title: A method to derive material-specific spin-bath model descriptions of materials displaying prevalent spin physics (for simulation on NISQ devices)
Authors: Benedikt M. Schoenauer, Nicklas Enenkel, Florian G. Eich, Vladimir V. Rybkin, Michael Marthaler, Sebastian Zanker, Peter Schmitteckert
Abstract: Magnetism and spin physics are true quantum mechanical effects and their description usually requires multi reference methods and is often hidden in the standard description of molecules in quantum chemistry. In this work we present a twofold approach to the description of spin physics in molecules and solids. First, we present a method that identifies the single-particle basis in which a given subset of the orbitals is equivalent to spin degrees of freedom for models and materials which feature significant spin physics at low energies. We introduce a metric for the spin-like character of a basis orbital, of which the optimization yields the basis containing the optimum spin-like basis orbitals. Second, we demonstrate an extended Schrieffer-Wolff transformation method to derive the effective Hamiltonian acting on the subspace of the Hilbert space in which the charge degree of freedom of electron densities in the spin-like orbitals is integrated out. The method then yields an effective spin-bath Hamiltonian description for the system. This extended Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is applicable to a wide range of Hamiltonians and has been utilized in this work for model Hamiltonians as well as the active space Hamiltonian of molecular chromium bromide.

Title: Effects of Dynamic Bonds on the Kinetic Pathways of Supramolecular Diblock Copolymers Disorder-Order Transition
Authors: Xiangyu Zhang, Dong Meng
Abstract: Supramolecular block copolymers (SBC) consist of covalent polymer building blocks that are connected into well-defined architectures via supramolecular bonds. Assisted by the dynamic and reversible supramolecular interactions, it is envisaged that SBC self-assemblies may exhibit more diverse morphologies, stimuli-responsivity comparing to their covalent analogues. At the fundamental level, these features are related to the free-energy landscape of self-assemblies. It is therefore of central importance to understand the impact of dynamic/reversible bonds on the free energy landscape during structure transitions. In this study, we first conduct smart Monte Carlo simulations to compare the kinetics of the disorder-order transition (DOT) of supramolecular diblock copolymers (SDBC) to that of covalent diblock copolymers (CDBC). The structural order parameter for CDBC exhibits a fast and smooth transition process across different random number seeds and initial configurations. In contrast, the SDBC system shows more diverse transition pathways, which can be classified into three types. These results suggest that reversible supramolecular interactions complicate the pathways, and bring about various intermediate structures. Next, we apply the string method to construct the minimum free energy path of the transition, from which the transition state and the free energy barrier are evaluated. It is found that the transition free energy barrier strongly correlates with the fraction of supramolecules. By decomposing the free energy into A-B interaction energy and association energy, we found that the interplay of both two effects decide the kinetic pathway and the final equilibrium structures.

Title: Partition function zeros of quantum many-body systems
Authors: B Sriram Shastry
Abstract: We present a method for calculating the Yang-Lee partition function zeros of a translationally invariant model of lattice fermions, exemplified by the Hubbard model. The method rests on a theorem involving the single electron self-energy $\Sigma_\sigma(k, i \omega_n)$ in the imaginary time Matsubara formulation. The theorem maps the Yang-Lee zeros to a set of wavevector and spin labeled virtual energies $\xi_{k \sigma}$. These, thermodynamically derived virtual energies, are solutions of equations involving the self-energy at corresponding $k\sigma$'s. Examples of the method in simplified situations are provided.

Title: Thermoelectric AC Josephson effect
Authors: Olli Mansikkamäki, Francesco Giazotto, Alexander Balatsky
Abstract: A temperature gradient ${\Delta}T$ across a Josephson junction induces a thermoelectric current. We predict the AC Josephson effect is activated when this current surpasses the junction's critical current. Our investigation of this phenomenon employs the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory framework in proximity to the critical temperature. Our results indicate that the frequency of the AC current is approximately given by ${\pi} S {\Delta} T / (2 {\Phi}_0)$, where $S$ represents the Seebeck coefficient and ${\Phi}_0$ the magnetic flux quantum and we estimate the frequency be on the range of GHz for Sn up to a THz for larger $S$ and $T_c$ materials. Furthermore, we propose two distinct experimental configurations to observe this effect.

Title: Observing Spatial Charge and Spin Correlations in a Strongly-Interacting Fermi Gas
Authors: Cyprien Daix, Maxime Dixmerias, Yuan-Yao He, Joris Verstraten, Tim de Jongh, Bruno Peaudecerf, Shiwei Zhang, Tarik Yefsah
Abstract: Two-dimensional correlated fermions constitute a cornerstone of quantum matter, covering a broad fundamental and technological scope, and have attracted increasing interest with the emergence of modern materials such as high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductors, graphene, topological insulators, and Moiré structures. Atom-based quantum simulators provide a new pathway to understand the microscopic mechanisms occurring at the heart of such systems. In this work, we explore two-dimensional attractive Fermi gases at the microscopic level by probing spatial charge and spin correlations in situ. Using atom-resolved continuum quantum gas microscopy, we directly observe fermion pairing and study the evolution of two- and three-point correlation functions as inter-spin attraction is increased. The precision of our measurement allows us to reveal a marked dip in the pair correlation function, fundamentally forbidden by the mean-field result based on Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory but whose existence we confirm in exact auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We demonstrate that the BCS prediction is critically deficient not only in the superfluid crossover regime but also deep in the weakly attractive side. Guided by our measurements, we find a remarkable relation between two- and three-point correlations that establishes the dominant role of pair-correlations. Finally, leveraging local single-pair losses, we independently characterize the short-range behavior of pair correlations, via the measurement of Tan's Contact, and find excellent agreement with numerical predictions. Our measurements provide an unprecedented microscopic view into two-dimensional Fermi gases and constitute a paradigm shift for future studies of strongly-correlated fermionic matter in the continuum.

Title: Composition Design of Shape Memory Ceramics based on Gaussian Processes
Authors: Ashutosh Pandey, Justin Jetter, Hanlin Gu, Eckhard Quandt, Richard D. James
Abstract: We present a Gaussian process machine learning model to predict the transformation temperature and lattice parameters of ZrO$_2$-based ceramics. Our overall goal is to search for a shape memory ceramic with a reversible transformation and low hysteresis. The identification of a new low hysteresis composition is based on design criteria that have been successful in metal alloys: (1) $\lambda_2 = 1$, where $\lambda_2$ is the middle eigenvalue of the transformation stretch tensor, (2) minimizing the max$|q(f)|$, which measures the deviation from satisfying the cofactor conditions, (3) high transformation temperature, (4) low transformational volume change, and (5) solid solubility. We generate many synthetic compositions, and identify a promising composition, 31.75Zr-37.75Hf-14.5Y-14.5Ta-1.5Er, which closely satisfies all the design criteria based on predictions from machine learning. However, differential thermal analysis reveals a relatively high thermal hysteresis of 137°C for this composition, indicating that the proposed design criteria are not universally applicable to all ZrO$_2$-based ceramics. We also explore reducing tetragonality of the austenite phase by addition of Er$_2$O$_3$. The idea is to tune the lattice parameters of austenite phase towards a cubic structure will increase the number of martensite variants, thus, allowing more flexibility for them to accommodate high strain during transformation. We find the effect of Er$_2$O$_3$ on tetragonality is weak due to limited solubility. We conclude that a more effective dopant is needed to achieve significant tetragonality reduction. Overall, Gaussian process machine learning models are shown to be highly useful for prediction of compositions and lattice parameters, but the discovery of low hysteresis ceramic materials apparently involves other factors not relevant to phase transformations in metals.

Title: Sliding Dynamics of Skyrmion Molecular Crystals
Authors: J. C. Bellizotti Souza, C. J. O. Reichhardt, C. Reichhardt, N. P. Vizarim, P. A. Venegas
Abstract: Using both atomistic and particle-based simulations, we investigate the current-driven dynamics of skyrmions on two-dimensional periodic substrates when there are multiple skyrmions per substrate minimum. At zero drive, the system forms pinned skyrmion molecular crystal states consisting of dimers, trimers, or dimer-trimer mixtures that have both positional and orientational order. On a square substrate lattice, the motion above depinning occurs via a running soliton that travels completely transverse to the applied current. This motion is generated by a torque from the Magnus force, which rotates the $n$-mer states perpendicular to the applied current. At higher drives, the flow becomes disordered while the Hall angle diminishes and gradually approaches the intrinsic value. In some cases, we also find directional locking where the Hall angle becomes locked to certain symmetry directions of the substrate over a range of currents. The transitions into and out of directionally locked states are accompanied by negative differential mobility in which the net velocity decreases as the drive increases. On a triangular substrate, we find no transverse mobility effects, but still observe directionally locked motion.

Title: Clustering Does Not Always Imply Latent Geometry
Authors: Roya Aliakbarisani, Marián Boguñá, M. Ángeles Serrano
Abstract: The latent space approach to complex networks has revealed fundamental principles and symmetries, enabling geometric methods. However, the conditions under which network topology implies geometricity remain unclear. We provide a mathematical proof and empirical evidence showing that the multiscale self-similarity of complex networks is a crucial factor in implying latent geometry. Using degree-thresholding renormalization, we prove that any random scale-free graph in a $d$-dimensional homogeneous and isotropic manifold is self-similar when interactions are pairwise. Hence, both clustering and self-similarity are required to imply geometricity. Our findings highlight that correlated links can lead to finite clustering without self-similarity, and therefore without inherent latent geometry. The implications are significant for network mapping and ensemble equivalence between graphs and continuous spaces.

Title: Bio-heat regimes in fractal-based models of tumors
Authors: Sébastien Fumeron, Malte Henkel, Alexander López
Abstract: Anomalous heat diffusion is investigated for biological tissues displaying a fractal structure and long-term thermal memory, which is modeled via a fractional derivative. For increasing values of the fractional derivation order, the tissue temperature displays three kinds of bio-heat regimes: damped (or sub-diffusive), critical damping and under-damped oscillations. The temperature profiles depend on the fractal dimension of the tissue but notably also on a parameter related to its topology: the spectral dimension. The parametric analysis reveals that these two parameters have antagonistic effects on the pseudo period of the temperature oscillations and their amplitudes. We discuss how our results might impact some treatment protocols.

Title: Role of Riemannian geometry in double-bracket quantum imaginary-time evolution
Authors: René Zander, Raphael Seidel, Li Xiaoyue, Marek Gluza
Abstract: Double-bracket quantum imaginary-time evolution (DB-QITE) is a quantum algorithm which coherently implements steps in the Riemannian steepest-descent direction for the energy cost function. DB-QITE is derived from Brockett's double-bracket flow which exhibits saddle points where gradients vanish. In this work, we perform numerical simulations of DB-QITE and describe signatures of transitioning through the vicinity of such saddle points. We provide an explicit gate count analysis using quantum compilation programmed in Qrisp.

Abstract: Semiconductors are among the most promising platforms to implement large-scale quantum computers, as advanced manufacturing techniques allow fabrication of large quantum dot arrays. Various qubit encodings can be used to store and manipulate quantum information on these quantum dot arrays. Regardless of qubit encoding, precise control over the exchange interaction between electrons confined in quantum dots in the array is critical. Furthermore, it is necessary to execute high-fidelity quantum operations concurrently to make full use of the limited coherence of individual qubits. Here, we demonstrate the parallel operation of two exchange-only qubits, consisting of six quantum dots in a linear arrangement. Using randomized benchmarking techniques, we show that issuing pulses on the five barrier gates to modulate exchange interactions in a maximally parallel way maintains the quality of qubit control relative to sequential operation. The techniques developed to perform parallel exchange pulses can be readily adapted to other quantum-dot based encodings. Moreover, we show the first experimental demonstrations of an iSWAP gate and of a charge-locking Pauli spin blockade readout method. The results are validated using cross-entropy benchmarking, a technique useful for performance characterization of larger quantum computing systems; here it is used for the first time on a quantum system based on semiconductor technology.

Title: Characterization of the chaotic phase in the tilted Bose-Hubbard model
Authors: Pilar Martín Clavero, Alberto Rodríguez
Abstract: The chaotic phase of the tilted Bose-Hubbard model is identified as a function of energy, tilt strength and particle interaction, from the eigenstate structure and the statistical features of the energy spectrum. Our analysis reveals that the chaotic phase of the bare Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian can actually be enhanced by the presence of a moderate tilt. We further unveil the development and scaling of the chaotic regime from the perspective of a homogeneous density configuration typically used in cold atom experiments, providing a valuable phase diagram for future theoretical and experimental studies of this system.

Title: Learning and criticality in a self-organizing model of connectome growth
Authors: Michelle T. Cirunay, Rene C. Batac, Géza Odór
Abstract: The exploration of brain networks has reached an important milestone as relatively large and reliable information has been gathered for connectomes of different species. Analyses of connectome data sets reveal that the structural length and the distributions of in- and out-node strengths follow heavy-tailed lognormal statistics, while the functional network properties exhibit powerlaw tails, suggesting that the brain operates close to a critical point where computational capabilities and sensitivity to stimulus is optimal. Because these universal network features emerge from bottom-up (self-)organization, one can pose the question of whether they can be modeled via a common framework, particularly through the lens of criticality of statistical physical systems. Here, we simultaneously reproduce the powerlaw statistics of connectome edge weights and the lognormal distributions of node strengths from an avalanche-type model with learning that operates on baseline networks that mimic the neuronal circuitry. We observe that the avalanches created by a sandpile-like model on simulated neurons connected by a hierarchical modular network (HMN) produce robust powerlaw avalanche size distributions with critical exponents of 3/2 characteristic of neuronal systems. Introducing Hebbian learning, wherein neurons that `fire together, wire together,' recovers the powerlaw distribution of edge weights and the lognormal distributions of node degrees, comparable to those obtained from connectome data. Our results strengthen the notion of a critical brain, one whose local interactions drive connectivity and learning without a need for external intervention and precise tuning.

Title: Sub-second spin and lifetime-limited optical coherences in $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$
Authors: Alexey Tiranov, Emanuel Green, Sophie Hermans, Erin Liu, Federico Chiossi, Diana Serrano, Pascal Loiseau, Achuthan Manoj Kumar, Sylvain Bertaina, Andrei Faraon, Philippe Goldner
Abstract: Optically addressable solid-state spins have been extensively studied for quantum technologies, offering unique advantages for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Advancing these applications is generally limited by finding materials that simultaneously provide lifetime-limited optical and long spin coherences. Here, we introduce $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$ ions doped into a CaWO$_4$ crystal. We perform high-resolution spectroscopy of the excited state, and demonstrate all-optical coherent control of the electron-nuclear spin ensemble. We find narrow inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions of 185 MHz and radiative-lifetime-limited coherence time up to 0.75 ms. Next to this, we measure a spin-transition ensemble line width of 5 kHz and electron-nuclear spin coherence time reaching 0.15 seconds at zero magnetic field between 50 mK and 1 K temperatures. These results demonstrate the potential of $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$ as a low-noise platform for building quantum technologies with ensemble-based memories, microwave-to-optical transducers, and optically addressable single-ion spin qubits.

Title: Arbitrary gauge quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent constraints
Authors: Adam Stokes, Ahsan Nazir
Abstract: We provide a general framework for the quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent holonomic constraints. Unless time dependence is present from the outset at the Lagrangian level, different gauges generally produce non-equivalent canonical theories. The irrotational gauge is defined as that which also yields a correct theory when time dependence is introduced at the Hamiltonian level. We unify examples of such gauges found in existing literature. In particular, we show that for describing time-dependent light-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so it does not enjoy any special status, contradicting the conclusions in Phys. Rev. A 107, 013722 (2023) and Phys. Rev. Research 3, 023079 (2021), while reaffirming the prior treatment and conclusions reported in Phys. Rev. Research 3, 013116 (2021).

Title: Random Phase Approximation Correlation Energy using Real-Space Density Functional Perturbation Theory
Authors: Boqin Zhang, Shikhar Shah, John E. Pask, Edmond Chow, Phanish Suryanarayana
Abstract: We present a real-space method for computing the random phase approximation (RPA) correlation energy within Kohn-Sham density functional theory, leveraging the low-rank nature of the frequency-dependent density response operator. In particular, we employ a cubic scaling formalism based on density functional perturbation theory that circumvents the calculation of the response function matrix, instead relying on the ability to compute its product with a vector through the solution of the associated Sternheimer linear systems. We develop a large-scale parallel implementation of this formalism using the subspace iteration method in conjunction with the spectral quadrature method, while employing the Kronecker product-based method for the application of the Coulomb operator and the conjugate orthogonal conjugate gradient method for the solution of the linear systems. We demonstrate convergence with respect to key parameters and verify the method's accuracy by comparing with planewave results. We show that the framework achieves good strong scaling to many thousands of processors, reducing the time to solution for a lithium hydride system with 128 electrons to around 150 seconds on 4608 processors.

Title: Many neighbors little entanglement: A curious scaling in the variable-range extended Ising model
Authors: Harikrishnan K J, Debasis Sadhukhan, Amit Kumar Pal
Abstract: We study the two-point correlation functions and the bipartite entanglement in the ground state of the exactly-solvable variable-range extended Ising model of qubits in the presence of a transverse field on a one-dimensional lattice. We introduce the variation in the range of interaction by varying the coordination number, $\mathcal{Z}$, of each qubit, where the interaction strength between a pair of qubits at a distance $r$ varies as $\sim r^{-\alpha}$. We show that the algebraic nature of the correlation functions is present only up to $r=\mathcal{Z}$, above which it exhibits short-range exponential scaling. We also show that at the critical point, the bipartite entanglement exhibits a power-law decrease ($\sim\mathcal{Z}^{-\gamma}$) with increasing coordination number irrespective of the partition size and the value of $\alpha$ for $\alpha>1$. We further consider a sudden quench of the system starting from the ground state of the infinite-field limit of the system Hamiltonian via turning on the critical Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the long-time averaged bipartite entanglement exhibits a qualitatively similar variation ($\sim\mathcal{Z}^{-\gamma}$) with $\mathcal{Z}$.

Title: Physical Modeling of Saturated Common Mode Choke
Authors: Anna Takacs, Balazs Gyure-Garami, Adam Z. Abraham, Peter T. Benko, Norbert M. Nemes, Ferenc Simon, Bence Bernath
Abstract: Common mode chokes (CMCs) are conventional circuit elements performing several tasks, including noise suppression, hindering electromagnetic interference, providing signal integrity, and circuit protection. Much as they are widely used, their fundamental construction and description are often qualitative and lack an understanding of the underlying physical principles. We discuss the behavior of a commercial CMC based on the physical description of the superparamagnetic core and parasitic circuit elements. The results are validated using a DC bias current and an external magnetic field, which affect the magnetic properties. The behavior of the CMCs in the strongly non-linear regime is also described.

Title: Superconductivity up to 17 K in the high-pressure rhombohedral-I phase of ReO3: a potential oxide analogy of hydride superconductors
Authors: P. F. Shan, T. L. Lu, Z. Y. Liu, Y. Y. Jiao, P. T. Yang, J. Hou, L. Ma, Y. Uwatoko, X. L. Dong, B. S. Wang, M. Liu, J. P. Sun, J.-G. Cheng
Abstract: As an A-site-vacant perovskite-type oxide, ReO3 undergoes sequential pressure-driven structural transitions associated with the rotation of ReO6 octahedra. The rhombohedral-I phase in the pressure range of 12-39 GPa is featured by a lattice of nearly close-packed oxygen layers intercalated with Re cations, in reminiscent of the recently discovered superhydride superconductors. A combined study of first-principles calculations and transport measurements under high pressures enabled us to discover superconductivity in the rhombohedral-I phase, and it shows a dome-shaped Tc(P) with a maximum Tc of 17 K at about 30 GPa. In addition to the enhanced density of states at Fermi level compared to that of the ambient phase, the vibrations of hexagonal-close-packed oxygen lattice significantly strengthen the electron-phonon coupling, which is responsible for observed superconductivity with a relatively high Tc. The present work thus establishes a rare case among oxide superconductors that the light-element oxygen lattice plays a crucial role in inducing superconductivity.

Title: Topological holography, quantum criticality, and boundary states
Authors: Sheng-Jie Huang, Meng Cheng
Abstract: Topological holography is a holographic principle that describes the generalized global symmetry of a local quantum system in terms of a topological order in one higher dimension. This framework separates the topological data from the local dynamics of a theory and provides a unified description of the symmetry and duality in gapped and gapless phases of matter. In this work, we develop the topological holographic picture for (1+1)d quantum phases, including both gapped phases as well as a wide range of quantum critical points, including phase transitions between symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, symmetry enriched quantum critical points, deconfined quantum critical points, and intrinsically gapless SPT phases. Topological holography puts a strong constraint on the emergent symmetry and the anomaly for these critical theories. We show how the partition functions of these critical points can be obtained from dualizing (orbifolding) more familiar critical theories. The topological responses of the defect operators are also discussed in this framework. We further develop a topological holographic picture for conformal boundary states of (1+1)d rational conformal field theories. This framework provides a simple physical picture to understand conformal boundary states and also uncovers the nature of the gapped phases corresponding to the boundary states.

Title: Enhanced thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional Janus ferromagnetic LaBrI with strain-induced valley degeneracy
Authors: Anuja Kumari, D. K. Raman, Tanu Choudhary, Raju K. Biswas, Abhinav Nag, Santanu K. Maiti, Jagdish Kumar
Abstract: Since the successful synthesis of the MoSSe monolayer, which violated the out-of-plane mirror symmetry of TMDs monolayers, considerable and systematic research has been conducted on Janus monolayer materials. By systematically analyzing the LaBrI monolayer, we are able to learn more about the novel Janus material by focusing on the halogen family next to group VIA (S, Se, Te). The structural optimizations have been carried out using pseudopotential based Quantum espresso code. Computed structural parameters are in good agreement with literature reports. The optimized crystal structures were used for computing effect of strain on electronic and thermoelectric properties. Dynamical stability predicts that this material can withstand up to 10% of tensile strain. Computed electronic structure reveals material to be indirect wide band gap ferromagnet with magnetic moment 1{\mu}B. With increase in the biaxial tensile strain the band gap decreases. Furthermore, the computed magneto-thermoelectric properties predict high Seebeck coefficient ~ 400 {\mu}V/K and low thermal conductivity of ~ 0.93 W/m.K in LaBrI which results in a high ZT ~ 1.84 for 4% strain at 800 K. The present study supports the fact that tensile strain on ferromagnetic LaBrI material can further enhance TE properties making it to be a promising material for TE applications at higher temperatures.

Title: Nematic quantum disordered state in FeSe
Authors: Ruixian Liu, Matthew B. Stone, Shang Gao, Mitsutaka Nakamura, Kazuya Kamazawa, Aleksandra Krajewska, Helen C. Walker, Peng Cheng, Rong Yu, Qimiao Si, Pengcheng Dai, Xingye Lu
Abstract: The unusual quantum-disordered magnetic ground state intertwined with superconductivity and electronic nematicity in FeSe has been a research focus in iron-based superconductors. However, the intrinsic spin excitations across the entire Brillouin zone in detwinned FeSe, which forms the basis for a microscopic understanding of the magnetic state and superconductivity, remain to be determined. Here, we use inelastic neutron scattering to map out the spin excitations of FeSe dewtinned with a uniaxial-strain device. We find that the stripe spin excitations (Q=(1, 0)/(0, 1)) exhibit the $C_2$ symmetry up to $E\approx120$ meV, while the N{é}el spin excitations (Q=(1, 1)) retain their $C_4$ symmetry in the nematic state. The temperature dependence of the difference in the spin excitations at Q=(1, 0) and (0, 1) for temperatures above the structural phase transition unambiguously shows the establishment of the nematic quantum disordered state. The similarity of the Néel excitations in FeSe and NaFeAs suggests that the Néel excitations are driven by the enhanced electron correlations in the $3d_{xy}$ orbital. By determining the key features of the stripe excitations and fitting their dispersions using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with biquadratic interaction ($J_1$-$K$-$J_2$), we establish a spin-interaction phase diagram and conclude that FeSe is close to a crossover region between the antiferroquadrupolar, Néel, and stripe ordering regimes. The results provide an experimental basis for establishing a microscopic theoretical model to describe the origin and intertwining of the emergent orders in iron-based superconductors.

Title: Spin gapped metals: A novel class of materials for multifunctional spintronic devices
Authors: E. Sasioglu, M. Tas, S. Ghosh, W. Beida, B. Sanyal S. Blugel, I. Mertig, I. Galanakis
Abstract: Gapped metals, a recently proposed class of materials, possess a band gap slightly above or below the Fermi level, behaving as intrinsic p- or n-type semiconductors without requiring external doping. Inspired by this concept, we propose a novel material class: "spin gapped metals". These materials exhibit intrinsic p- or n-type character independently for each spin channel, similar to dilute magnetic semiconductors but without the need for transition metal doping. A key advantage of spin gapped metals lies in the absence of band tails that exist within the band gap of conventional p- and n-type semiconductors. Band tails degrade the performance of devices like tunnel field-effect transistors (causing high subthreshold slopes) and negative differential resistance tunnel diodes (resulting in low peak-to-valley current ratios). Here, we demonstrate the viability of spin gapped metals using first-principles electronic band structure calculations on half-Heusler compounds. Our analysis reveals compounds displaying both gapped metal and spin gapped metal behavior, paving the way for next-generation multifunctional devices in spintronics and nanoelectronics.

Title: Bulk condensation by an active interface
Authors: Raushan Kant, Rahul Kumar Gupta, Harsh Soni, A K Sood, Sriram Ramaswamy
Abstract: We present experiments, supported by mechanically detailed simulations, establishing bulk vapor-liquid condensation of a hard-bead fluid by a tiny population of orientable motile grains that self-assembles into a moving polarized monolayer. In a quasi-1D geometry two such layers, oppositely aligned, immobilize the condensed non-motile component. We account for our observations through a continuum theory with a naturally non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard structure, whose predicted trends as a function of packing fraction are consistent with our observations.

Title: Quantum entanglement in a pure state of strongly correlated quantum impurity systems
Authors: Yunori Nishikawa, Tomoki Yoshioka
Abstract: We consider quantum entanglement in strongly correlated quantum impurity systems for states manifesting interesting properties such as multi-level Kondo effect and dual nature between itineracy and localization etc.. For this purpose, we set up a system consisting of one or two quantum impurities arbitrarily selected from the system as a subsystem, and investigate quantum entanglement with its environmental system. We reduce the pure state of interest as described above to the subsystem, and formulate quantum informative quantities such as entanglement entropy, mutual information and relative entropy. We apply them to quantum impurity systems consisting of several sites and the single impurity Anderson model to study the relationship between their states and the behaviors of quantum informative quantities. The obtained results suggest that the method proposed here is promising for elucidating the quantum entanglement of pure states in various quantum impurity systems.

Title: Prediction of Room Temperature Electric Field Reversal of Magnetization in the Family of $A_4B_3\rm{O}_9$ Layered Oxides
Authors: Urmimala Dey, Emma E. McCabe, Jorge Íñiguez-González, Nicholas C. Bristowe
Abstract: The promise of a strong magnetoelectric coupling in a multiferroic material is not only of fundamental interest, but also forms the basis of next generation memory devices where the direction of magnetization can be reversed by an external electric field. Using group-theory led first-principles calculations, we have identified a hitherto unknown polar phase of the $A_4B_3\rm{O}_9$ layered oxides, where the polar mode couples to the magnetic modes through a rare $\Gamma$-point magnetoelectric-multiferroic coupling scheme such that the net magnetization can be directly reversed by an electric field switching of the polar mode. Furthermore, in agreement with previous experimental observations, we predict room temperature magnetism in $A_4B_3\rm{O}_9$ oxides which indicates the promising practical applications of these compounds in the next generation memory devices.

Title: Fluctuations in Spin Dynamics Excited by Pulsed Light
Authors: Tetsuya Sato, Shinichi Watanabe, Mamoru Matsuo, Takeo Kato
Abstract: We theoretically investigate nonequilibrium spin fluctuations in a ferromagnet induced by a light pulse. Using a Lindblad equation consistent with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we compute the autocorrelation function of magnetization. Our analysis reveals that this function comprises both thermal and nonequilibrium components. To examine the latter in detail, we introduce a Fano factor similar to nonequilibrium current noise in electronic circuits. We demonstrate that this factor encapsulates insights into the transfer of spin units to the environment. Our findings lay the groundwork for nonequilibrium spin noise spectroscopy, offering valuable insights into spin relaxation dynamics.

Title: Magnetic single wall CrI3 nanotubes encapsulated within multiwall Carbon Nanotubes
Authors: Ihsan Caha, Loukya Boddapatti, Aqrab ul Ahmad, Manuel Banobre, Antonio T. Costa, Andrey N. Enyashin, Weibin Li, Pierluigi Gargiani, Manuel Valvidares, Joaquin Fernandez-Rossier, Francis Leonard Deepak
Abstract: CrI3 is a layered ferromagnetic insulator that has recently attracted enormous interest as it was the first example of a stand-alone monolayer ferromagnet, paving the way towards the study of two-dimensional magnetic materials and their use as building blocks of hybrid van der Waals layered heterostructures. Here we go one step down in the dimensionality ladder and report the synthesis and characterization of a tubular one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure where CrI3 nanotubes are encapsulated within multiwall carbon nanotubes, integrating a magnetic insulator and a conductor. By means of the capillary filling of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), we obtained single-wall CrI3 nanotubes with diameters ranging between 2 nm and 10 nm, with an average of 5.3 nm. Using aberration corrected electron microscopy in combination with spectroscopic techniques we confirm the structure and chemical composition of the nanotubes. SQUID measurements, combined with element-specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) indicate unequivocally that the Cr atoms in encapsulated CrI3 nanotubes are magnetic with a collective state compatible with a radial magnetization state predicted both by first-principles calculations and a model Hamiltonian. Our results represent a step forward in establishing 1D van der Waals heterostructures as a playground for the exploration of non-collinear magnetic states arising from the interplay between magnetic anisotropy and curvature in tubular geometries.

Title: Competing aggregation and iso-density equilibrium lead to band pattern formation in density gradients

Abstract: Centrifugation of biological matter in density gradient solutions is a standard method for separating cell types or components. It is also used to separate red blood cells (RBCs) by age, as they lose water and become denser over their lifespan. When the density gradient is prepared with Percoll, discrete bands of RBCs are systematically observed along the gradient, despite the continuous density distribution of RBCs. Early studies suggested that cell aggregation might influence spatial distribution, but it remains debated whether a continuous density population can form discrete bands. We developed a continuity equation incorporating cell aggregation to describe the macroscopic evolution of RBC volume fraction in a density gradient, considering a continuous RBC density distribution. Numerical solutions demonstrate that the competition between isodensity distribution and aggregation is sufficient to create band patterns. Our model reproduces the temporal evolution observed in experiments, but also predicts several types of bifurcation-like behaviors for the steady-state patterns in constant gradients, depending on RBC volume fraction and aggregation energy. This demonstrates that the competition between RBC aggregation and iso-density distribution is a novel mechanism driving pattern formation.

Title: Robustness of electron charge shuttling: Architectures, pulses, charge defects and noise thresholds
Authors: Minjun Jeon, Simon C. Benjamin, Andrew J.Fisher
Abstract: In semiconductor-based quantum technologies, the capability to shuttle charges between components is profoundly enabling. We numerically simulated various "conveyor-belt" shuttling scenarios for simple Si/SiO2 devices, explicitly modelling the electron's wave function using grid-based split-operator methods and a time-dependent 2D potential (obtained from a Poisson solver). This allowed us to fully characterise the electron loss probability and excitation fraction. Remarkably, with as few as three independent electrodes the process can remain near-perfectly adiabatic even in the presence of pulse imperfection, nearby charge defects, and Johnson-Nyquist noise. Only a substantial density of charge defects, or defects at 'adversarial' locations, can catastrophically disrupt the charge shuttling. While we do not explicitly model the spin or valley degrees of freedom, our results from this charge propagation study support the conclusion that conveyor-belt shuttling is an excellent candidate for providing connectivity in semiconductor quantum devices.

Title: Universal and non-universal large deviations in critical systems
Authors: Ivan Balog, Bertrand Delamotte, Adam Rançon
Abstract: Rare events play a crucial role in understanding complex systems. Characterizing and analyzing them in scale-invariant situations is challenging due to strong correlations. In this work, we focus on characterizing the tails of probability distribution functions (PDFs) for these systems. Using a variety of methods, perturbation theory, functional renormalization group, hierarchical models, large $n$ limit, and Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate universal rare events of critical $O(n)$ systems. Additionally, we explore the crossover from universal to nonuniversal behavior in PDF tails, extending Cramér's series to strongly correlated variables. Our findings highlight the universal and nonuniversal aspects of rare event statistics and challenge existing assumptions about power-law corrections to the leading stretched exponential decay in these tails.

Title: Persistent quantum vibronic dynamics in a $5d^1$ double perovskite oxide
Authors: Naoya Iwahara, Jian-Rui Soh, Daigorou Hirai, Ivica Živković, Yuan Wei, Wenliang Zhang, Carlos Galdino, Tianlun Yu, Kenji Ishii, Federico Pisani, Oleg Malanyuk, Thorsten Schmitt, Henrik M Rønnow
Abstract: Quantum entanglement between the spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom in condensed matter systems can emerge due to an interplay between spin-orbit and vibronic interactions. Heavy transition metal ions decorated on a face-centered cubic lattice, for example, in $5d^1$ double perovskites, are particularly suited to support these quantum entangled states, but direct evidence has not yet been presented. In this work, we report additional peaks in the low-energy spectra of a $5d^1$ double perovskite, Ba$_2$CaReO$_6$, which cannot be explained by adopting a purely classical description of lattice vibrations. Instead, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that these spectroscopic signatures are characteristic of orbital-lattice entangled states in Ba$_2$CaReO$_6$. Crucially, both theory and experiment demonstrate that these quantum-entangled states persist to low temperatures, despite the onset of multipolar order.

Title: Momentum-space modulated symmetries in the Luttinger liquid
Authors: Alexandre Chaduteau, Nyan Raess, Henry Davenport, Frank Schindler
Abstract: The chiral Luttinger liquid develops quantum chaos as soon as a -- however slight -- nonlinear dispersion is introduced for the microscopic electronic degrees of freedom. For this nonlinear version of the model, we identify an infinite family of translation-invariant interaction potentials with corresponding modulated symmetries. These symmetries are highly unconventional: they are modulated in momentum space (and do not seem to have an easy physical interpretation). We develop a systematic understanding of these symmetries and study the resulting blocks in the Hamiltonian. In particular, this approach allows us to predict the analytic Hamiltonian block sizes and derive asymptotic scaling laws in the limit of large total momentum. These blocks are reminiscent of Hilbert space fragmentation in that, even though they are labeled by a symmetry, this symmetry is highly nonlocal and does not have a simple interpretation. We corroborate this result by studying entanglement entropy and level statistics.

Title: Equilibrium non-linear phononics by electric field fluctuations of terahertz cavities
Authors: Emil Viñas Boström, Marios H. Michael, Christian Eckhardt, Angel Rubio
Abstract: Selective excitation of vibrational modes using strong laser pulses has emerged as a powerful material engineering paradigm. However, to realize deterministic control over material properties for device applications, it is desirable to have an analogous scheme without a drive, operating in thermal equilibrium. We here propose such an equilibrium analog of the light-driven paradigm, leveraging the strong coupling between lattice degrees of freedom and the quantum fluctuations of the electric field of a THz micro-cavity. We demonstrate this approach by showing, using ab initio data, how electric field fluctuations can induce a sub-dominant ferromagnetic order, on top of the dominant zig-zag antiferromagnet order, in FePS$_3$ close to its Néel temperature.

Title: Dissipation induced transition between delocalization and localization in the three-dimensional Anderson model
Authors: Xuanpu Yang, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Zijun Wei, Yucheng Wang, Lei Pan
Abstract: We investigate the probable delocalization-localization transition in open quantum systems with disorder. The disorder can induce localization in isolated quantum systems and it is generally recognized that localization is fragile under the action of dissipations from the external environment due to its interfering nature. Recent work [Y. Liu, et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 216301 (2024).] found that a one-dimensional quasiperiodic system can be driven into the localization phase by a tailored local dissipation where a dissipation-induced delocalized-localized transition is proposed. Based on this, we consider a more realistic system and show that a dissipation-induced transition between delocalization and localization appears in the three-dimensional (3D) Anderson model. By tuning local dissipative operators acting on nearest neighboring sites, we find that the system can relax to localized states dominated steady state instead of the choice of initial conditions and dissipation strengths. Moreover, we can also realize a delocalized states predominated steady-state from a localized initial state by using a kind of dissipation operators acting on next nearest neighboring sites. Our results enrich the applicability of dissipation-induced localization and identify the transition between delocalized and localized phases in 3D disordered systems.

Title: Topological characterization of a non-Hermitian ladder via Floquet non-Bloch theory
Authors: Koustav Roy, Koustabh Gogoi, Saurabh Basu
Abstract: In this paper, we study a non-Hermitian (NH) ladder subjected to a variety of driving protocols. The driven system looses chiral symmetry (CS) whose presence is indispensable for its topological characterization. Further, the bulk boundary correspondence (BBC) gets adversely affected due to the presence of non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Here, we present a formalism that not only retrieves the lost CS, but also restores the BBC via the construction of a generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). Specifically, we employ delta and step drives to compare and contrast between them with regard to their impact on NHSE. Further, a widely studied harmonic drive is invoked in this context, not only for the sake of completeness, but its distinct computational framework offers valuable insights on the properties of out-of-equilibrium systems. While the delta and the harmonic drives exhibit unidirectional skin effect in the system, the step drive may show bi-directional skin effect. Also, there are specific points in the parameter space that are devoid of skin effect. These act as critical points that distinguish the skin modes to be localized at one boundary or the other. Moreover, for the computation of the non-Bloch invariants, we employ GBZ via a pair of symmetric time frames corresponding to the delta and the step drives, while a high-frequency expansion was carried out to deal with the harmonic drive. Finally, we present phase boundary diagrams that demarcate distinct NH phases obtained via tracking the trajectories of the exceptional points. These diagrams demonstrate a co-existence of the zero and $\pi$ energy modes in the strong NH limit and thus may be relevant for studies of Floquet time crystals.

Title: Phases and Phase Transitions of the Disordered Quantum Clock Model
Authors: Vishnu Pulloor Kuttanikkad, Gaurav Khairnar, Rajesh Narayanan, Thomas Vojta
Abstract: We study the phases and phase transitions of a disordered one-dimensional quantum $q$-state clock Hamiltonian using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Making contact with earlier results, we confirm that the clean, translational invariant version of the model, for $q=6$, hosts an intermediate emergent quasi-long-range ordered (QLRO) phase between the symmetry-broken true long-range ordered (TLRO) phase and the disordered (paramagnetic) phase. With increasing disorder strength, the quasi-long-range ordered phase shrinks and finally vanishes at a multi-critical point, beyond which there is a direct transition from the TLRO phase to the paramagnetic phase. After establishing the phase diagram, we characterize the critical behaviors of the various quantum phase transitions in the model. We find that weak disorder is an irrelevant perturbation of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions that separate the QLRO phase from the TLRO and paramagnetic phases. For stronger disorder, some of the critical exponents become disorder-dependent already before the system reaches the multicritical point. We also show that beyond the multicritical point, the direct transition from the TLRO phase to the paramagnetic phase is governed by an infinite-randomness critical point in line with strong-disorder renormalization group predictions. While our numerical results are for $q=6$, we expect the qualitative features of the behavior to hold for all $q>4$.

Title: An Atlas of Classical Pyrochlore Spin Liquids
Authors: Daniel Lozano-Gómez, Owen Benton, Michel J. P. Gingras, Han Yan
Abstract: Frustrated magnetism in the pyrochlore lattice magnet has proven to be a most fruitful setting for the experimental and theoretical search for spin liquids. Besides the canonical case of spin ice, recent works have identified a variety of new classical and quantum spin liquids engendered by the generic nearest-neighbor anisotropic spin Hamiltonian for that lattice. However, a general framework for the thorough and systematic classification and characterization of these exotic states of matter has been lacking, as has an exhaustive list of all possible spin liquids that this model can support and, perhaps most interesting, what is the corresponding structure of their emergent field theory description. In this work, we develop such a theoretical framework to identify the interaction parameters stabilizing different classical spin liquids and derive their corresponding effective generalized Gauss's laws at low temperatures. Combining this with Monte Carlo simulations, we systematically identify all classical spin liquids for the general nearest-neighbor anisotropic spin Hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice. In doing so, we uncover new spin liquid models with exotic forms of generalized Gauss's law and multipole conservation laws. Our approach allows us to compile an atlas of all spin liquids realized in the phase diagram, providing a global picture of their mutual connections in parameter space and transitions between them. Our work will inform future theoretical and experimental studies of classical and quantum spin liquids on the pyrochlore lattice and help rationalize the exotic properties of pyrochlore magnets.

Title: Measuring entanglement without local addressing in quantum many-body simulators via spiral quantum state tomography
Authors: Giacomo Marmorini, Takeshi Fukuhara, Daisuke Yamamoto
Abstract: Quantum state tomography serves as a key tool for identifying quantum states generated in quantum computers and simulators, typically involving local operations on individual particles or qubits to enable independent measurements. However, this approach requires an exponentially larger number of measurement setups as quantum platforms grow in size, highlighting the necessity of more scalable methods to efficiently perform quantum state estimation. Here, we present a tomography scheme that scales far more efficiently and, remarkably, eliminates the need for local addressing of single constituents before measurements. Inspired by the ``spin-spiral'' structure in magnetic materials, our scheme combines a series of measurement setups, each with different spiraling patterns, with compressed sensing techniques. The results of the numerical simulations demonstrate a high degree of tomographic efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we show how this method is suitable for the measurement of specific entanglement properties of interesting quantum many-body states, such as entanglement entropy, under various realistic experimental conditions. This method offers a positive outlook across a wide range of quantum platforms, including those in which precise individual operations are challenging, such as optical lattice systems.

Title: Understanding process-structure-property relation for elastoplastic behavior of polymer nanocomposites with agglomeration anomalies and gradient interphase percolation
Authors: Prajakta Prabhune, Anlan Chen, Yigitcan Comlek, Wei Chen, L. Catherine Brinson
Abstract: For polymer nanocomposites, disordered microstructural nature makes processing control and tailoring properties to desired values a challenge. Understanding process-structure-property relation can provide guidelines for process and constituents design. Our work explores nuances of PSP relation for polymer nanocomposites with attractive pairing between particles and polymer bulk. In the absence of any nano or micro-scale local property measurement, we develop a material model that can represent decay for small strain elastoplastic properties in interfacial regions and simulate representative or statistical volume element behavior. This interfacial model is further combined with a microstructural design of experiments for agglomerated nanocomposite systems. Agglomerations are particle aggregations that are microstructural defects resulting from lack of processing control. Twin screw extrusion process can reduce extent of aggregation in hot pressed samples via erosion or rupture depending on screw rpms and toque. We connect this process-structure relation to structure-property relation that emerges from our study. We discover that balancing between local stress concentration zone and interfacial property decay governs how fast yield stress can improve if we break down agglomeration via erosion. Rupture is relatively less effective in helping improve nanocomposite yield strength. Additionally, we allude to yield initiation and progression in these multiphase materials. We have come up with a field quantity called local yield resistance that indicates balance stress concentration zones and interfacial effects. Yield resistance map from linear regime acts as a predictor of local yielding process and can be a useful tool for interface design for plastic deformation behavior.

Title: Role of electron-electron interaction in the Mpemba effect in quantum dots
Authors: Juliane Graf, Janine Splettstoesser, Juliette Monsel
Abstract: The Mpemba effect has initially been noticed in macroscopic systems -- namely that hot water can freeze faster than cold water -- but recently its extension to open quantum systems has attracted significant attention. This phenomenon can be explained in the context of nonequilibrium thermodynamics of Markovian systems, relying on the amplitudes of different decay modes of the system dynamics. Here, we study the Mpemba effect in a single-level quantum dot coupled to a thermal bath, highlighting the role of the sign and magnitude of the electron-electron interaction in the occurrence of the Mpemba effect. We gain physical insights into the decay modes from a dissipative symmetry of this system called fermionic duality. Based on this analysis of the relaxation to equilibrium of the dot, we derive criteria for the occurrence of the Mpemba effect using two thermodynamically relevant measures of the distance to equilibrium, the nonequilibrium free energy and the dot energy. We furthermore compare this effect to a possible exponential speedup of the relaxation. Finally, we propose experimentally relevant schemes for the state preparation and explore different ways of observing the Mpemba effect in quantum dots in experiments.

Title: Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Epitaxial Laterally Overgrown Diamond: Towards Up-scaling of Color Center-based Quantum Technologies
Authors: Nimba Oshnik, Sebastian Westrich, Nina Burmeister, Oliver Roman Opaluch, Lahcene Mehmel, Riadh Issaoui, Alexandre Tallaire, Ovidiu Brinza, Jocelyn Achard, Elke Neu
Abstract: Providing high-quality, single-crystal diamond (SCD) with a large area is desirable for up-scaling quantum technology applications that rely on color centers in diamond. Growth methods aiming to increase the area of SCD are an active research area. Native color centers offer a sensitive probe for local crystal quality in such novel materials e.g., via their reaction to stress. In this work, we investigate individual native nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in SCD layers manufactured via laterally overgrowing hole arrays in a heteroepitaxially grown large-scale substrate. Heteroepitaxy has become a common tool for growing large SCDs; however, achieving the high crystal quality needed for quantum applications remains a challenge. In the overgrown layer, we identify NV centers with spin-decoherence times in the order of hundreds of microseconds, comparable to high-purity homoepitaxial SCD. We quantify the effective crystal strain in different regions of the overgrown layer, indicating a low stress overall and a stress reduction in the diamond layer above the holes.

Title: Selective enhancement of Coulomb interactions in planar Weyl fermions
Authors: Vadym Apalkov, Wenchen Luo, Tapash Chakraborty
Abstract: We report on our study of the electron interaction effects in topological two-dimensional (2D) materials placed in a quantizing magnetic field. Taking our cue from a recent experimental report, we consider a particular case of bismuthene monolayer with a strong spin-orbit interaction which can be a Weyl semimetal when placed on a specially tuned substrate. Interestingly, we observe that in some Landau levels of this material, the interaction effects are strongly enhanced compared to those for a conventional 2D system. Such an enhancement of electron-electron interactions in these materials is largely due to an anisotropy present in the materials. Additionally, the interaction effects can be tuned by changing the coupling to the substrate and the strongest inter-electron interactions are observed when the system is a Weyl semimental. The observed enhancement of the interaction effects can therefore be an important signature of the 2D Weyl fermions.

Title: Vacancy-assisted superfluid drag
Authors: Thomas G. Kiely, Chao Zhang, Erich J. Mueller
Abstract: We study superfluid drag in the two-component Bose-Hubbard model with infinitely strong repulsive interactions. In this system, all transport is mediated by the motion of empty sites, or ``holes", and it is hard to move one component without moving the other. We demonstrate, with a combination of analytic and numeric techniques, that the motion of holes leads to strong dissipationless coupling between currents in the two components. This behavior is attributable to polaronic correlations that emerge in the presence of spin currents, which can be observed in experiments. We derive a closed-form expression for the coupling on various lattices in arbitrary spatial dimensions, which we verify through numerical simulations on two dimensional lattices.

Title: Collective Behavior and Memory States in Flow Networks with Tunable Bistability
Authors: Lauren E. Altman, Nadia Awad, Douglas J. Durian, Miguel Ruiz-Garcia, Eleni Katifori
Abstract: Multistability-induced hysteresis has been widely studied in mechanical systems, but such behavior has proven more difficult to reproduce experimentally in flow networks. Natural flow networks like animal and plant vasculature exhibit complex nonlinear behavior to facilitate fluid transport, so multistable flows may inform their functionality. To probe such phenomena in an analogous model system, we utilize an electronic network of hysterons designed to have tunable negative differential resistivity. We demonstrate our system's capability to generate complex global memory states in the form of voltage patterns. The tunable nonlinearity of each element's current-voltage characteristic allows us to navigate this space of hysteretic behavior, and can be utilized to engineer more complex networks with exotic effects such as avalanches and multiperiodic orbits.

Title: Nonanalytic Landau functionals shaping the finite-size scaling of fluctuations and response functions in and out of equilibrium
Authors: Krzysztof Ptaszynski, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: Landau theory relates phase transitions to the minimization of the Landau functional (e.g., free energy functional), which is expressed as a power series of the order parameter. It has been shown that the critical behavior of certain physical systems can be described using Landau functionals that include nonanalytic terms, corresponding to odd or even noninteger powers of the absolute value of the order parameter. In particular, these nonanalytic terms can determine the order of the phase transition and the values of the critical exponents. Here, we show that such terms can also shape the finite-size scaling behavior of fluctuations of observables (e.g., of energy or magnetization) or the response functions (e.g., heat capacity or magnetic susceptibility) at the continuous phase transition point. We demonstrate this on two examples, the equilibrium molecular zipper and the nonequilibrium version of the Curie--Weiss model.

Title: Stability of Floquet sidebands and quantum coherence in 1D strongly interacting spinless fermions
Authors: Karun Gadge, Salvatore R. Manmana
Abstract: For strongly correlated quantum systems, fundamental questions about the formation and stability of Floquet-Bloch sidebands (FBs) upon periodic driving remain unresolved. Here, we investigate the impact of electron-electron interactions and perturbations in the coherence of the driving on the lifetime of FBs by directly computing time-dependent single-particle spectral functions using exact diagonalization (ED) and matrix product states (MPS). We study interacting metallic and correlated insulating phases in a chain of correlated spinless fermions. At high-frequency driving we obtain clearly separated, long-lived FBs of the full many-body excitation continuum. However, if there is significant overlap of the features, which is more probable in the low-frequency regime, the interactions lead to strong heating, which results in a significant loss of quantum coherence and of the FBs. Similar suppression of FBs is obtained in the presence of noise. The emerging picture is further elucidated by the behavior of real-space single-particle propagators, of the energy gain, and of the momentum distribution function, which is related to a quantum Fisher information that is directly accessible by spectroscopic measurements.

Title: Collective Dynamics in Active Polar Polymer Assemblies
Authors: Hossein Vahid, Jens-Uwe Sommer, Abhinav Sharma
Abstract: Active polymers respond to spatial activity gradients by autonomously migrating, a behavior central to biological self-organization and the design of intelligent synthetic materials. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate how the structure and propulsion direction of tangentially driven active polymers (TDAPs) determine their collective response to activity gradients. We show that TDAP assemblies exhibit strikingly different behaviors based on their organization: inward-directed arms form compact bundles that accumulate in low-activity regions, whereas outward-directed arms assemble into asters that undergo directed motion toward high-activity regions. Remarkably, mixed structures, comprising both inward- and outward-directed arms, display enhanced accumulation in the high-activity regions due to cooperative effects. In addition, we show that two-arm polymers accumulate within a finite-width active slab embedded in a passive background, and as the slab narrows, the polymers reorient perpendicular to the slab boundaries to remain within the active regions. Our results establish a fundamental link between polymer geometry and emergent transport, providing key design principles for programmable active materials.

Title: Energy Dispersion, Superconductivity and Magnetic Fluctuations in Stacked Altermagnetism Materials
Authors: Jun Chang, Hantao Lu, Jize Zhao, Hong-Gang Luo, Yang Ding
Abstract: Recently, altermagnetism (AM) has emerged as a new category of magnetism, alongside conventional antiferromagnetism (AFM) and ferromagnetism (FM). In an AM, superconductivity (SC) is faced with a dilemma that the spin-polarized bands, induced by the broken time reversal (T ) symmetry, dominantly supports spin-triplet pairing. In contrast, AM spin fluctuations routinely facilitate spin-singlet pairing as in AFM. Consequently, unconventional SC is either absent or weak in AM materials. Here, we propose that stacking 2D AM materials could resolve this dilemma. Stacked 2D materials have yielded a variety of new electronic properties by altering the symmetries inherent in the monolayer. In a 2D anisotropic Hubbard model, we investigate the general energy dispersions of both single-layer and stacked AM materials. We demonstrate that AM sheet stacking can alter the original symmetries, consequently affecting the energy dispersion. The interlayer magnetic coupling enhances the low q magnetic fluctuations. T symmetry is restored in the AA stacking with an antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, and then both the energy dispersion and pairing interaction are in favor of spin-singlet SC. The ferromagnetic interlayer coupling in the AB stacking not only recovers T symmetry but also supports spin-triplet pairing. It is further anticipated that twisted bilayer AM sheets could exhibit additional novel electronic properties, including topology, flat bands, and collective excitations. Our work illustrates that stacking sheets of AM materials could open up a unique research domain in exploring novel quantum phenomena and offer a fertile ground for potential electronic applications.

Title: Double commutator method for a two band Bose-Einstein condensate: superfluid density of a flat band superfluid
Authors: Yi-Cai Zhang
Abstract: In this work, we propose a double commutator method for a general two-band bosonic superfluid. First and foremost, we prove that the sum of the superfluid and normal densities is equal to the weight of the f-sum rule. This weight can be easily determined by analyzing the ground state wave function. Once we have determined the excitation gap of the upper band, we can calculate the normal density by evaluating the average value of a double commutator between the velocity operator and the Hamiltonian. As an application of this method, we investigate the superfluid density of a flat band Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using the Bogoliubov method, we calculate the sound velocity and excitation gap, which allows us to obtain the normal and superfluid densities explicitly. Our findings indicate that the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the square of the sound velocity and the compressibility. Furthermore, the existence of a non-vanishing superfluid density depends on the form of the interaction. For example, in the case of U(2) invariant interactions, the superfluid density is zero. Additionally, we have observed that for small interactions, the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the interaction parameter and the quantum metric. The double commutator method indicates that the correction of the excitation gap by interactions is the origin of the non-vanishing superfluid density of a flat band BEC. Up to the linear order of the interaction parameters, all the results for the excitation gap, the normal and superfluid densities in a flat band BEC can also be obtained through a simple perturbation theory. Our work provides another unique perspective on the superfluid behavior of a flat band BEC.

Title: Revealing the Low Temperature Phase of FAPbI$_3$ using A Machine-Learned Potential
Authors: Sangita Dutta, Erik Fransson, Tobias Hainer, Benjamin M. Gallant, Dominik J. Kubicki, Paul Erhart, Julia Wiktor
Abstract: FAPbI$_3$ is a material of interest for its potential in solar cell applications, driven by its remarkable optoelectronic properties. However, the low-temperature phase of FAPbI$_3$ remains poorly understood, with open questions surrounding its crystal structure, octahedral tilting, and the arrangement of formamidinium (FA) cations. Using our trained machine-learned potential in combination with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we provide a detailed investigation of this phase, uncovering its structural characteristics and dynamical behavior. Our analysis reveals the octahedral tilt pattern and sheds light on the rotational dynamics of FA cations in the low temperature phase. Strikingly, we find that the FA cations become frozen in a metastable configuration, unable to reach the thermodynamic ground state. By comparing our simulated results with experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra, we demonstrate good agreement, further validating our findings. This phenomenon mirrors experimental observations and offers a compelling explanation for the experimental challenges in accessing the true ground state.

Abstract: Altermagnets, a recently discovered class of magnetic materials exhibiting ferromagnetic-like spin-split bands and antiferromagnetic-like compensated magnetic order, have attracted significant interest for next-generation spintronic applications. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has emerged as a promising altermagnetic candidate due to its compensated antiparallel magnetic order and strong spin-split electronic bands. However, recent experimental and theoretical reports also suggest that RuO2 may be non-magnetic in its ground state, underscoring the need for deeper investigations into its magnetic character. Specifically, the (100)-oriented RuO2 films are expected to generate spin currents with transverse spin polarization parallel to the Néel vector. Here, we investigate magnetotransport in epitaxial RuO2/Permalloy (Py) heterostructures to examine spin Hall magnetoresistance and interfacial effects generated in such systems. Our measurements reveal a pronounced negative angular-dependent magnetoresistance for variation of magnetic field direction perpendicular to the charge current direction. Detailed temperature-, magnetic field-, and crystallographic orientation-dependent measurements indicate that interface-generated spin current (IGSC) at the RuO2/Py interface predominantly governs the observed magnetoresistance. This shows that strong interface effects dominate over possible altermagnetic contributions from RuO2. Our results show that the role of interface-generated spin currents is crucial and should not be overlooked in studies of altermagnetic systems. A critical step in this direction is disentangling interfacial from altermagnetic contributions. The insight into interfacial contributions from altermagnetic influences is essential for the advancement of RuO2 based spintronic memory and sensing applications.

Title: Signatures of Enhanced Superconducting Properties in Niobium Cavities
Authors: D. Bafia (1), A. Grassellino (1), M. Checchin (2), J. F. Zasadzinski (3), A. Romanenko (1) ((1) Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, (2) SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, (3) Illinois Institute of Technology)
Abstract: Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) niobium cavities are critical for modern particle accelerators, as well as for advancing superconducting quantum systems and enabling ultra-sensitive searches for new physics. In this work, we report a systematic observation of an anomalous frequency dip in Nb cavities, which occurs at temperatures just below the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$), indicative of enhanced superconducting properties at $T \ll T_c$. The magnitude of this dip is strongly correlated with the RF surface resistance, impurity distribution near the surface, and $T_\mathrm{c}$. Additionally, we report measurements of the coherence peak in the AC conductivity of two Nb SRF cavities processed using distinct methods. By comparing recent theories developed to model this experimental data, we show that the frequency dip feature, larger coherence peak height, and reduction in the temperature-dependent surface resistance with RF current occur at minimal but finite levels of disorder.

Title: Unifying fractons, gravitons and photons from a gauge theoretical approach
Authors: Rodrigo F. Sobreiro
Abstract: We revisit the first principles gauge theoretical construction of relativistic gapless fracton theory developed by A.~Blasi and N.~Maggiore. The difference is that, instead of considering a symmetric tensor field, we consider a vector field with a gauge group index, \emph{i.e.} the usual Einstein-Cartan variable used in the first order formalism of gravity. After discussing the most general quadratic action for this field, we explore the physical sectors contained in the model. Particularly, we show that the model contains not only linear gravity and fractons, but also ordinary Maxwell equations, suggesting an apparent electrically charged phase of, for instance, spin liquids and glassy dynamical systems. Moreover, by a suitable change of field variables, we recover the Blasi-Maggiore gauge model of fractons and linear gravity.

Title: Controlling measurement-induced phase transitions with tunable detector coupling
Authors: Ritu Nehra, Alessandro Romito, Dganit Meidan
Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.

Title: Fundamental computational limits of weak learnability in high-dimensional multi-index models
Authors: Emanuele Troiani, Yatin Dandi, Leonardo Defilippis, Lenka Zdeborová, Bruno Loureiro, Florent Krzakala
Abstract: Multi-index models - functions which only depend on the covariates through a non-linear transformation of their projection on a subspace - are a useful benchmark for investigating feature learning with neural nets. This paper examines the theoretical boundaries of efficient learnability in this hypothesis class, focusing on the minimum sample complexity required for weakly recovering their low-dimensional structure with first-order iterative algorithms, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $n\!=\!\alpha d$ is proportional to the covariate dimension $d$. Our findings unfold in three parts: (i) we identify under which conditions a trivial subspace can be learned with a single step of a first-order algorithm for any $\alpha\!>\!0$; (ii) if the trivial subspace is empty, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an easy subspace where directions that can be learned only above a certain sample complexity $\alpha\!>\!\alpha_c$, where $\alpha_{c}$ marks a computational phase transition. In a limited but interesting set of really hard directions -- akin to the parity problem -- $\alpha_c$ is found to diverge. Finally, (iii) we show that interactions between different directions can result in an intricate hierarchical learning phenomenon, where directions can be learned sequentially when coupled to easier ones. We discuss in detail the grand staircase picture associated to these functions (and contrast it with the original staircase one). Our theory builds on the optimality of approximate message-passing among first-order iterative methods, delineating the fundamental learnability limit across a broad spectrum of algorithms, including neural networks trained with gradient descent, which we discuss in this context.

Title: Memory Kernel Coupling Theory: Obtain Time Correlation Function from Higher-order Moments
Authors: Wei Liu, Yu Su, Yao Wang, Wenjie Dou
Abstract: Dynamical observables can often be described by time correlation functions (TCFs). However, efficiently calculating TCFs for complex quantum systems is a significant challenge, which generally requires solving the full dynamics of the systems. This Letter presents the memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT), a general formalism for evaluating TCFs. The MKCT builds upon Mori's memory kernel formalism for TCFs. Our theory further decomposes the memory kernel into auxiliary kernels. Rapid decay of auxiliary kernels allows us to truncate the coupled equations of motion with high accuracy. Notably, only higher-order moments are sufficient as the input for obtaining TCFs. While this formalism is general, we carry out the numerical demonstration for a typical open quantum system--the spin-boson model.

Title: Approximate inverse measurement channel for shallow shadows
Authors: Riccardo Cioli, Elisa Ercolessi, Matteo Ippoliti, Xhek Turkeshi, Lorenzo Piroli
Abstract: Classical shadows are a versatile tool to probe many-body quantum systems, consisting of a combination of randomised measurements and classical post-processing computations. In a recently introduced version of the protocol, the randomization step is performed via unitary circuits of variable depth $t$, defining the so-called shallow shadows. For sufficiently large $t$, this approach allows one to get around the use of non-local unitaries to probe global properties such as the fidelity with respect to a target state or the purity. Still, shallow shadows involve the inversion of a many-body map, the measurement channel, which requires non-trivial computations in the post-processing step, thus limiting its applicability when the number of qubits $N$ is large. In this work, we put forward a simple approximate post-processing scheme where the infinite-depth inverse channel is applied to the finite-depth classical shadows and study its performance for fidelity and purity estimation. The scheme allows for different circuit connectivity, as we illustrate for geometrically local circuits in one and two spatial dimensions and geometrically non-local circuits made of two-qubit gates. For the fidelity, we find that the resulting estimator coincides with a known linear cross-entropy, achieving an arbitrary small approximation error $\delta$ at depth $t=O(\log (N/\delta))$ (independent of the circuit connectivity). For the purity, we show that the estimator becomes accurate at a depth $O(N)$. In addition, at those depths, the variances of both the fidelity and purity estimators display the same scaling with $N$ as in the case of global random unitaries. We establish these bounds by analytic arguments and extensive numerical computations in several cases of interest. Our work extends the applicability of shallow shadows to large system sizes and general circuit connectivity.

Title: Binding and dimerization control phase separation in a compartment
Authors: Riccardo Rossetto, Gerrit Wellecke, David Zwicker
Abstract: Biological cells exhibit a hierarchical spatial organization, where various compartments harbor condensates that form by phase separation. Cells can control the emergence of these condensates by affecting compartment size, the amount of the involved molecules, and their physical interactions. While physical interactions directly affect compartment binding and phase separation, they can also cause oligomerization, which has been suggested as a control mechanism. Analyzing an equilibrium model, we illustrate that oligomerization amplifies compartment binding and phase separation, which reinforce each other. This nonlinear interplay can also induce multistability, which provides additional potential for control. Our work forms the basis for deriving thermodynamically consistent kinetic models to understand how biological cells can regulate phase separation in their compartments.

Title: Streamlined optical training of large-scale modern deep learning architectures with direct feedback alignment

Abstract: Modern deep learning relies nearly exclusively on dedicated electronic hardware accelerators. Photonic approaches, with low consumption and high operation speed, are increasingly considered for inference but, to date, remain mostly limited to relatively basic tasks. Simultaneously, the problem of training deep and complex neural networks, overwhelmingly performed through backpropagation, remains a significant limitation to the size and, consequently, the performance of current architectures and a major compute and energy bottleneck. Here, we experimentally implement a versatile and scalable training algorithm, called direct feedback alignment, on a hybrid electronic-photonic platform. An optical processing unit performs large-scale random matrix multiplications, which is the central operation of this algorithm, at speeds up to 1500 TeraOPS under 30 Watts of power. We perform optical training of modern deep learning architectures, including Transformers, with more than 1B parameters, and obtain good performances on language, vision, and diffusion-based generative tasks. We study the scaling of the training time, and demonstrate a potential advantage of our hybrid opto-electronic approach for ultra-deep and wide neural networks, thus opening a promising route to sustain the exponential growth of modern artificial intelligence beyond traditional von Neumann approaches.

Title: Criticality-Enhanced Quantum Sensing with a Parametric Superconducting Resonator
Authors: Guillaume Beaulieu, Fabrizio Minganti, Simone Frasca, Marco Scigliuzzo, Simone Felicetti, Roberto Di Candia, Pasquale Scarlino
Abstract: Quantum metrology, a cornerstone of quantum technologies, exploits entanglement and superposition to achieve higher precision than classical protocols in parameter estimation tasks. When combined with critical phenomena such as phase transitions, the divergence of quantum fluctuations is predicted to enhance the performance of quantum sensors. Here, we implement a critical quantum sensor using a superconducting parametric (i.e., two-photon driven) Kerr resonator. The sensor, a linear resonator terminated by a supercondicting quantum interference device, operates near the critical point of a finite-component second-order dissipative phase transition obtained by scaling the system parameters. We analyze the performance of a frequency-estimation protocol and show that quadratic precision scaling with respect to the system size can be achieved with finite values of the Kerr nonlinearity. Since each photon emitted from the cavity carries more information about the parameter to be estimated compared to its classical counterpart, our protocol opens perspectives for faster or more precise metrological protocols. Our results demonstrate that quantum advantage in a sensing protocol can be achieved by exploiting a finite-component phase transition.

Title: Phase vs coin vs position disorder as a probe for the resilience and revival of single particle entanglement in cyclic quantum walks
Authors: Dinesh Kumar Panda, Colin Benjamin
Abstract: Quantum states exhibiting single-particle entanglement (SPE) can encode and process quantum information more robustly than their multi-particle analogs. Understanding the vulnerability and resilience of SPE to disorder is therefore crucial. This letter investigates phase, coin, and position disorder via discrete-time quantum walks on odd and even cyclic graphs to study their effect on SPE. The reduction in SPE is insignificant for low levels of phase or coin disorder, showing the resilience of SPE to minor perturbations. However, SPE is seen to be more vulnerable to position disorder. We analytically prove that maximally entangled single-particle states (MESPS) at time step $t=1$ are impervious to phase disorder regardless of the choice of the initial state. Further, MESPS at timestep $t=1$ is also wholly immune to coin disorder for phase-symmetric initial states. Position disorder breaks odd-even parity and distorts the physical time cone of the quantum walker, unlike phase or coin disorder. SPE saturates towards a fixed value for position disorder, irrespective of the disorder strength at large timestep $t$. Furthermore, SPE can be enhanced with moderate to significant phase or coin disorder strengths at specific time steps. Interestingly, disorder can revive single-particle entanglement from absolute zero in some instances, too. These results are crucial in understanding single-particle entanglement evolution and dynamics in a lab setting.

Title: Addendum: Long-range multi-scalar models at three loops
Authors: Dario Benedetti, Razvan Gurau, Sabine Harribey
Abstract: We correct the computation of one Feynman diagram in the three-loop beta functions for the long-range quartic multi-scalar model, originally presented in (2020 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 53 445008) [arXiv:2007.04603]. The correction requires the use of a different method than in the original paper, and we give here full details about the method. We then report the updated numerics for critical exponents of the Ising model, vector model, cubic model and bifundamental model. Mathematica files for the numerical evaluation of the corrected diagram are provided in ancillary.

Title: Holographic Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories including a non-hydrodynamic mode
Authors: Yan Liu, Ya-Wen Sun, Xin-Meng Wu
Abstract: We derive the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories for diffusion including the lowest non-hydrodynamic degree of freedom from holographic Gubser-Rocha systems. At low temperature the dynamical non-hydrodynamic mode could be either an IR mode or a slow mode, which is related to IR quantum critical excitations or encodes the information of all energy scales. This additional dynamical vector mode could be viewed as an ultraviolet sector of the diffusive hydrodynamic theory. We construct two different effective actions for each case and discuss their physical properties. In particular we show that the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger symmetry is preserved.

Title: Modeling biases in binary decision-making within the generalized nonlinear q-voter model
Authors: Maciej Doniec, Pratik Mullick, Parongama Sen, Katarzyna Sznajd-Weron
Abstract: Collective decision-making is a process by which a group of individuals determines a shared outcome that shapes societal dynamics; from innovation diffusion to organizational choices. A common approach to model these processes is using binary dynamics, where the choices are reduced to two alternatives. One of the most popular models in this context is the $q$-voter model, which assumes that opinion changes are driven by peer pressure from a unanimous group. However, real-world decisions are also shaped by prior personal choices and external influences, such as mass media, which introduce biases that can favor certain options over others. To address this, we propose a generalized $q$-voter model that incorporates these biases. In our model, when the influence group is not unanimous, the probability that an individual changes its opinion depends on its current state, breaking the symmetry between opinions. In limiting cases, our model recovers both the original $q$-voter model and several recently introduced modifications of the $q$-voter model, while extending the framework to capture a broader range of scenarios. We analyze the model on a complete graph using analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations. Our results highlight two key findings: (1) for larger influence groups ($q>3$), a phase emerges where both adopted and partially adopted states coexist, (2) in small systems, greater initial support for an opinion does not necessarily increase its likelihood of widespread adoption, as reflected in the unique form of the exit probability. These results point to one of the key issues in social science, the importance of group size in collective action.

Title: The BPHZL renormalization of a planar quantum electrodynamics up to 2-loops and beyond
Authors: D.O.R. Azevedo, O.M. Del Cima, L.S. Lima, E.S. Miranda
Abstract: The renormalization of a parity-even massless $U(1)\times U(1)$ quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions (QED$_3$) is studied by adopting the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann-Lowenstein (BPHZL) renormalization method. The presence of two massless fermions requires the Lowenstein-Zimmermann (LZ) subtraction scheme to renormalize the infrared divergences induced by the ultraviolet subtractions at 1- and 2-loops, moreover due to the model superrenormalizability the ultraviolet divergences are bounded up to 2-loops. Finally, through the BPHZL renormalization method together with the LZ subtraction scheme the ultraviolet and infrared finiteness of the model is proved up to 2-loops and beyond.

Title: Dissipation-Driven Transition of Particles from Dispersive to Flat Bands
Authors: Yutao Hu, Chao Yang, Yucheng Wang
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) play a crucial role in condensed matter physics, offering an ideal platform to study strong correlation effects and enabling applications in diffraction-free photonics and quantum devices. However, the study and application of FB properties are susceptible to interference from dispersive bands. Here, we explore the impact of bond dissipation on systems hosting both flat and dispersive bands by calculating the steady-state density matrix. We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.
