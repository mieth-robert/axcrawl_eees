Title: Incorporation of physics-based strengthening coefficients into phenomenological crystal plasticity models
Authors: Nikhil Prabhu, Martin Diehl
Abstract: The efforts associated with parametrization of continuum-based models for crystal plasticity are a significant obstacle for the routine use of these models in materials science and engineering. While phenomenological constitutive descriptions are attractive due to their small number of adjustable parameters, the lack of physical meaning of their parameters counteracts this advantage to some extent. This study shows that interaction/strengthening coefficients determined with the help of discrete dislocation dynamics simulations for use in physics-based formulations can also be used to improve the predictive quality of phenomenological models. Since the values of these parameters have been determined for most technologically relevant materials, the findings enable to improve the parametrization of phenomenological crystal plasticity models at no costs.

Title: Tentaclelike spectra and bound states in Hatano-Nelson chain with long-range impurity coupling
Authors: Xiaoming Zhao, Haiping Hu
Abstract: In non-Hermitian systems, the energy spectra and eigenstates exhibit high sensitivity to boundary conditions, lattice geometries, and local impurities. In this paper, we study the effect of long-range impurity coupling, located far from the boundaries, on the paradigmatic non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson model. Through exact analytical treatment, we reveal the intriguing tentacle-like spectral structures that emerge from the otherwise Bloch or non-Bloch spectra under periodic or open boundary conditions, respectively. We show that these spectral tentacles are associated with emergent bound states near the impurity, with their number determined by the coupling range. We further determine the localization length of these tentacled states using the transfer matrix. Our work indicates that the long-range impurity coupling cannot be treated as a mere perturbative effect and holds promise for state manipulations in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Making sense of negative probabilities: An exact representation of the dynamics of quantum spin chains as classical stochastic processes with particle/antiparticle pairs
Authors: Tony Jin
Abstract: Since the advent of quantum mechanics, classical probability interpretations have faced significant challenges. A notable issue arises with the emergence of negative probabilities when attempting to define the joint probability of non-commutative observables. In this work, we propose a resolution to this dilemma by introducing an exact representation of the dynamics of quantum spin chains using classical continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). These CTMCs effectively model the creation, annihilation, and propagation of pairs of classical particles and antiparticles. The quantum dynamics then emerges by averaging over various realizations of this classical process.

Title: Thermal and thermoelectric transport in flat bands with non-trivial quantum geometry
Authors: Kevin Wen, Hong-Yi Xie, Assa Auerbach, Bruno Uchoa
Abstract: Although quasiparticles in flat bands have zero group velocity, they can display an anomalous velocity due to the quantum geometry. We address the thermal and thermoelectric transport in flat bands in the clean limit with a small amount of broadening due to inelastic scattering. We derive general Kubo formulas for flat bands in the DC limit up to linear order in the broadening and extract expressions for the thermal conductivity, the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients. We show that the Seebeck coefficient for flat Chern bands is topological up to second order corrections in the broadening. We identify thermal and thermoelectric transport signatures for two generic flat Chern bands and also for the generalized flattened Lieb model, which describes a family of three equally spaced flat Chern bands where the middle one is topologically trivial. Finally, we address the saturation of the quantum metric lower bound for a general family of Hamiltonians with an arbitrary number of flat Chern bands corresponding to SU(2) coherent states. We find that only the extremal bands in this class of Hamiltonians saturate the bound, provided that the momentum dependence of their Hamiltonians is described by a meromorphic function.

Title: Si-compatible topological and infrared materials: the promise of Low-Sn GeSn digital alloys
Authors: Yunfan Liang, Damien West, Shunda Chen, Jifeng Liu, Tianshu Li, Shengbai Zhang
Abstract: Recently, GeSn alloys have attracted much interest for direct-gap infrared photonics and as potential topological materials which are compatible with the semiconductor industry. However, for photonics, the high-Sn content required leads to low detectivity, associated with poor material quality, and the (>35%) Sn required for topological properties have been out of reach experimentally. Here, we demonstrate that by patterning the Sn distribution within Ge, the electronic properties have a far greater tunability than is possible with the random alloy. For the GeSn \delta-digital alloy (DA) formed by confining Sn atoms in atomic layer(s) along the [111] direction of Ge, we show that ~10% Sn can lead to a triple-point semimetal. These findings are understood in terms of Sn ordering causing spatial separation of Sn and Ge band edges, leading to band inversion. This mechanism can also lead to a weak topological insulator, Weyl semimetal, and enables tunable direct bandgaps down to 2 meV, covering the entire infrared range. Our findings are generally applicable to other semiconductors DAs and point to a new class of currently unexplored topological systems accessible by epitaxy and establish the promise of low-Sn GeSn DAs for application as infrared laser diodes and photodetectors in Si photonic integrated circuits and infrared image sensors.

Title: Ultrafast Charge Separation on the Nanoscale Induced by a Uniform Field
Authors: Jan-Philip Joost, Michael Bonitz
Abstract: When illuminated by white light, atoms, molecules, and materials absorb only certain characteristic energy contributions based on their absorption properties. Here, we show that this effect can be translated from energy to space: a spatially uniform laser pulse can create strongly localized carrier excitations, including excitons, and spatial charge separation on the sub-nanometer scale within a few femtoseconds, opening new avenues for nanoelectronics and bringing petahertz switching within reach. Using nonequilibrium Green functions simulations we demonstrate this effect by exciting targeted areas of small graphene nanoribbon heterostructures by careful choice of the laser energy and polarization.

Title: Controlling phase selection, preferred orientation and epitaxy in molybdenum oxide films on mica and sapphire with oxygen content
Authors: Faezeh A.F. Lahiji, Biplab Paul, Ganpati Ramanath, Arnaud le Febvrier, Per Eklund
Abstract: Molybdenum oxide films are attractive for diverse applications due to properties offered by multiple phases and polymorphs, which also makes exclusive synthesis of desired phases a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate that oxygen flow ratio pO2 is key to phase selection, the type and extent of preferred orientation and epitaxy. Exclusive formation of non-layered monoclinic MoO2 crystals is supported on both mica and sapphire substrates at 500 °C within much of the 0.1 \le pO2 \le 0.25 range, outside which the films are amorphous. At 400 °C, the behavior is qualitatively similar, except for layered orthorhombic MoO3 formation at high pO2 and greater sensitivity of phase selection to pO2 due to the presence of a larger number of other phases. Increasing the pO2 tends to enhance preferred orientation and epitaxy, with fine-grained petal-like microstructure forming at low pO2, and large thin-sheeted crystals for at high pO2; however, MoO2 grows epitaxially on both f-mica and c-sapphire substrates while layered \alpha-MoO3 grows epitaxially on f- mica but not on sapphire These findings should facilitate the rationale synthesis of MoOx thin films with control over preferred orientation and microstructure to access and tune properties for applications. The research highlights the critical role of control over deposition parameters in tailoring the properties of MoOx films for applications such as electrochromic coatings and gas sensing.

Title: Topological frustration in twisted, elastic ribbons
Authors: Carlos E. Moguel-Lehmer, Christian D. Santangelo
Abstract: Topology is an important determinant of the behavior of a great number of condensed-matter systems, but until recently has played a minor role in elasticity. We develop a theory for the deformations of a class of twisted non-Euclidean sheets which have a symmetry based on the celebrated Bonnet isometry. We show that non-orientability is an obstruction to realizing the symmetry globally, and induces a geometric phase that captures a memory analogous to a previously identified one in 2D metamaterials. However, we show that some of the orientable ribbons also obstruct realizing the symmetry globally. This new obstruction is mediated by the complex interplay between strain, geometry, and topology.

Title: van der Waals epitaxy of α-MoO3 films on f-mica by pulsed sputter deposition
Authors: Faezeh A. F. Lahiji, Biplab Paul, Arnaud le Febvrier, Ganpati Ramanath, Per Eklund
Abstract: This study examines the growth characteristics and structural properties of {\alpha}-MoO3 thin films with thicknesses ranging from 2.5 to 160 nm, deposited on f-mica and c-sapphire substrates at 400 °C. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the films are predominantly orthorhombic {\alpha}-MoO3 with a preferred 0k0 orientation along the out-of-plane direction on both substrates. The d-spacing for the 060 reflection shows a slight reduction with increased thickness, particularly on f-mica, which suggests minimal out-of-plane strain in the film and a stabilization of lattice parametes over larger thicknesses. Furthermore, full-width at half maximum measurements indicate improved stacking and crystal quality on f-mica compared to c-sapphire. The films on f-mica exhibit epitaxial growth with specific orientation relationships, while films on c-sapphire display a fiber texture. The near- thickness-independent nature of the peak positions on f-mica suggests stable lattice parameters and reduced strain accumulation, could be attributed to the van der Waals epitaxy. These results highlight the role of substrate choice in {\alpha}-MoO3 film growth and minimizing strain, providing valuable insights into the tuning of thin-film properties.

Title: Shape Changes of Liquid Crystal Elastomers Swollen by Low Molecular Weight Liquid Crystal Drops
Authors: Mahesha Kodithuwakku Arachchige, Rohan Dharmarathna, Paul Fleischer, Antal Jakli
Abstract: An elastomer swelling actuator deforms by absorbing a fluid, thus generating mechanical movement. We show that depositing small droplets of low molecular weight liquid crystal on liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) films leads to shape changes and bending actuation. It is found that the radially symmetric LCE director alignments provide radially symmetric hat shapes, while swelling LCEs with uniform director structure leads to arch shapes. Hybrid samples (different director alignments on two sides) lead to more complicated bent shapes. All the observed shapes can be explained by the diffusion that mainly progresses along the direction normal to the director of the LCE. The swelling induced bending force is elevating the top of the swollen LCE up to a factor of 30, providing a powerful and long-lasting actuation. These observations may lead to applications in various fields, like sealants, soft robotics and biomedical devices.

Title: Behavior of Ising spins and ecological oscillators on dynamically rewired small world networks
Authors: Davi Arrais Nobre, Karen C. Abbott, Jonathan Machta, Alan Hastings
Abstract: Many ecological populations are known to display a cyclic behavior with period 2. Previous work has shown that when a metapopulation (group of coupled populations) with such dynamics is allowed to interact via nearest neighbor dispersal in two dimensions, it undergoes a phase transition from disordered (spatially asynchronous) to ordered (spatially synchronous) that falls under the 2-D Ising universality class. While nearest neighbor dispersal may satisfactorily describe how most individuals migrate between habitats, we should expect a small fraction of individuals to venture on a journey to further locations. We model this behavior by considering ecological oscillators on dynamically rewired small-world networks, in which at each time step a fraction $p$ of the nearest neighbor interactions is replaced by a new interaction with a random node on the network. We measure how this connectivity change affects the critical point for synchronizing ecological oscillators. Our results indicate that increasing the amount of long-range interaction (increasing $p$) favors the ordered regime, but the presence of memory in ecological oscillators leads to quantitative differences in how much long-range dispersal is needed to order the network, relative to an analogous network of Ising spins. We also show that, even for very small values of $p$, the phase transition falls into the mean-field universality class, and argue that ecosystems where dispersal can occasionally happen across the system's length scale will display a phase transition in the mean-field universality class.

Title: Quasi-Large Hole Polarons in BiVO4-Implications for Photocatalysis and Solar Energy Conversion
Authors: Zhimeng Hao, Taifeng Liu
Abstract: Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4 BVO) is a promising photocatalyst for solar energy conversion, but its efficiency is limited by small polaron formation. However, some physical properties of BVO deviate from typical small polaron behavior. Using the state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that BVO forms a quasi-large hole polaron with a radius around 2 nm, resembling free carriers with high mobility. This polaron is stabilized primarily by acoustic phonon modes, creating a shallow trap state near the valence band maximum, which prolongs its lifetime. Simultaneously, it retains a redox potential comparable to that of free carriers. We propose that such large polarons explain the superior properties of BVO and other transition metal oxide photocatalysts. Tuning phonon modes to stabilize large polarons offers a promising strategy for designing materials with enhanced solar energy conversion efficiency.

Title: Analysis of adiabatic shear coupled to ductile fracture and melting in viscoplastic metals
Authors: John D. Clayton
Abstract: Material failure by adiabatic shear is analyzed in viscoplastic metals that can demonstrate up to three distinct softening mechanisms: thermal softening, ductile fracture, and melting. An analytical framework is constructed for studying simple shear deformation with superposed static pressure. A continuum power-law viscoplastic formulation is coupled to a ductile damage model and a solid-liquid phase transition model in a thermodynamically consistent manner. Criteria for localization to a band of infinite shear strain are discussed. An analytical-numerical method for determining the critical average shear strain for localization and commensurate stress decay is devised. Averaged results for a high-strength steel agree reasonably well with experimental dynamic torsion data. Calculations probe possible effects of ductile fracture and melting on shear banding, and vice-versa, including influences of cohesive energy, equilibrium melting temperature, and initial defects. A threshold energy density for localization onset is positively correlated to critical strain and inversely correlated to initial defect severity. Tensile pressure accelerates damage softening and increases defect sensitivity, promoting shear failure. In the present steel, melting is precluded by ductile fracture for loading conditions and material properties within realistic protocols. If heat conduction, fracture, and damage softening are artificially suppressed, melting is confined to a narrow region in the core of the band.

Title: An attention-based neural ordinary differential equation framework for modeling inelastic processes
Authors: Reese E. Jones, Jan N. Fuhg
Abstract: To preserve strictly conservative behavior as well as model the variety of dissipative behavior dis- played by solid materials, we propose a significant enhancement to the internal state variable-neural ordinary differential equation (ISV-NODE) framework. In this data-driven, physics-constrained modeling framework internal states are inferred rather than prescribed. The ISV-NODE consists of: (a) a stress model dependent, on observable deformation and inferred internal state, and (b) a model of the evolution of the internal states. The enhancements to ISV-NODE proposed in this work are multifold: (a) a partially input convex neural network stress potential provides polyconvexity in terms of observed strain and inferred state, and (b) an internal state flow model uses common latent features to inform novel attention-based gating and drives the flow of internal state only in dissipative regimes. We demonstrated that this architecture can accurately model dissipative and conservative behavior across an isotropic, isothermal elastic-viscoelastic-elastoplastic spectrum with three exemplars.

Title: Thermal response functions and second sound in single-layer hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Patrick K. Schelling, Antonio Martinez Margolles, Logan Echazabal
Abstract: Ballistic heat transport and second sound propagation in solids is of direct relevance in electronic and energy applications at short length scales and low temperatures. Measurement or calculation of thermal conductivity, which is typically a primary objective, may be of limited usefulness for predicting heat transport which does not follow the heat-diffusion equation. In this paper, molecular-dynamics simulations of hexagonal BN (h-BN) are used to compute thermal response functions from equilibrium correlation functions defined in Fourier space. The response functions are useful for describing the time-dependent transport beyond the usual assumptions of Fourier's law. The results demonstrate that for length scales ~110nm at T=100K second sound should be experimentally observable. At higher temperatures and longer length scales, while second sound may not be directly observable, thermal transport can nevertheless strongly deviate from predictions based on the heat-diffusion equation. Along with classical simulations, we outline a first-principles, many-body theoretical approach for calculation of the response function based on solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The relevant expressions for heat current clarify the importance of phase coherence within a phonon branch to the observation of second sound. Previous work on one-dimensional chains is also discussed to show that materials characterized by linear dispersion and simple phonon band structure should more readily display second sound.

Title: Thermal Stability of Skyrmion Tubes in Nanostructured Cuboids
Authors: Jiang Jailiang, Tang Jin, Bai Tian, Wu Yaodong, Qin Jiazhuan, Xia Weixing, Chen Renjie, Yan Aru, Wang Shouguo, Tian Mingliang, Du Haifeng
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions in bulk materials are typically regarded as two-dimensional structures. However, they also exhibit three-dimensional configurations, known as skyrmion tubes, which elongate and extend in-depth. Understanding the configurations and stabilization mechanism of skyrmion tubes is crucial for the development of advanced spintronic devices. However, the generation and annihilation of skyrmion tubes in confined geometries are still rarely reported. Here, we present direct imaging of skyrmion tubes in nanostructured cuboids of a chiral magnet FeGe using Lorentz transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), while applying an in-plane magnetic field. It is observed that skyrmion tubes stabilize in a narrow field-temperature region near the Curie temperature (Tc). Through a field cooling process, metastable skyrmion tubes can exist in a larger region of the field-temperature diagram. Combining these experimental findings with micromagnetic simulations, we attribute these phenomena to energy differences and thermal fluctuations. Our results could promote topological spintronic devices based on skyrmion tubes.

Title: Beyond the Drude model: surface and non-local effects in near-field radiative heat transfer and the Casimir puzzle
Authors: Jian-Sheng Wang
Abstract: We study the charge and current response functions $P$ and $\Pi$ in a semi-infinite metal block using the electron surface Green's functions. The surface electrons behave similarly to a two-dimensional Fermi gas but are strongly damped due to coupling to the bulk. This substantially reduces the region of validity of the Drude model for $P$, which requires the frequency $\omega \gg \max( v_F q, 1/\tau)$, here $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity, $q$ is the wavevector and $\tau$ is an effective relaxation time. As a consequence, for typical metal in near-field heat transfer, the Coulomb interaction goes as $1/d^4$ with the distance of the vacuum gap instead of the well-known $1/d^2$ of Drude model result. The current response $\Pi$ is shown to be highly anisotropic. The Drude model describes well the transverse directions parallel to the surface but is very different in the normal direction up to about 100 lattice sites away from the surface. These ideas and the residue diamagnetic effect of a nonzero $\Pi$ on the surface at zero frequency still cannot resolve the Casimir puzzle.

Title: Multi-Carrier Thermal Transport in Electronic and Energy Conversion Devices
Authors: Te-Huan Liu, Tianyu Wang, Jun Zhou, Xin Qian, Ronggui Yang
Abstract: Nonequilibrium multi-carrier thermal transport is essential for both scientific research and technological applications in electronic, spintronic, and energy conversion devices. This article reviews the fundamentals of phonon, electron, spin, and ion transport driven by temperature gradients in solid-state and soft condensed matters, and the microscopic interactions between energy/charge carriers that can be leveraged for manipulating electrical and thermal transport in energy conversion devices, such as electron-phonon coupling, spin-phonon interaction, and ion-solvent interactions, etc. In coupled electron-phonon transport, we discuss the basics of electron-phonon interactions and their effects on phonon dynamics, thermalization, and nonequilibrium thermal transport. For the phonon-spin interaction, nonequilibrium transport formulation is introduced first, followed by the physics of spin thermoelectric effect and strategies to manipulate them. Contributions to thermal conductivity from magnons as heat carriers are also reviewed. For coupled transport of heat and ions/molecules, we highlight the importance of local molecular configurations that determine the magnitude of the electrochemical gradient, which is the key to improving the efficiency of low-grade heat energy conversion.

Title: Percolation in a three-dimensional non-symmetric multi-color loop model
Authors: Soumya Kanti Ganguly, Sumanta Mukherjee, Chandan Dasgupta
Abstract: We conducted Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the percolation transition of a non-symmetric loop model on a regular three-dimensional lattice. We calculated the critical exponents for the percolation transition of this model. The percolation transition occurs at a temperature that is close to, but not exactly the thermal critical temperature. Our finite-size study on this model yielded a correlation length exponent that agrees with that of the three-dimensional XY model with an error margin of six per cent.

Title: Instabilities, thermal fluctuations, defects and dislocations in the crystal-$R_I$-$R_{II}$ rotator phase transitions of n-alkanes
Authors: Soumya Kanti Ganguly, Prabir K. Mukherjee
Abstract: The theoretical study of instabilities, thermal fluctuations, and topological defects in the crystal-rotator-I-rotator-II ($X-R_{I}-R_{II}$) phase transitions of n-alkanes has been conducted. First, we examine the nature of the $R_{I}-R_{II}$ phase transition in nanoconfined alkanes. We propose that under confined conditions, the presence of quenched random orientational disorder makes the $R_{I}$ phase unstable. This disorder-mediated transition falls within the Imry-Ma universality class. Next, we discuss the role of thermal fluctuations in certain rotator phases, as well as the influence of dislocations on the $X-R_I$ phase transition. Our findings indicate that the Herringbone order in the $X$-phase and the Hexatic order in the $R_{II}$-phase exhibit quasi-long-range characteristics. Furthermore, we find that in two dimensions, the unbinding of dislocations does not result in a disordered liquid state.

Title: Antiferromagnetic diamond network as an efficient spin filter: Proposition of a spin-specific semi-conducting behavior
Authors: Debjani Das Gupta, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: We propose, for the first time, that an array of diamond plaquettes, each possessing vanishing net magnetization, can achieve complete spin polarization over a broad bias window. Furthermore, this system can be utilized to realize spin-specific semiconducting behavior. We describe the antiferromagnetic diamond network within a tight-binding framework, where spin-dependent scattering arises due to the interaction between itinerant electrons and local magnetic moments at different lattice sites. The mechanism underlying spin filtration relies on the specific arrangement of magnetic moments within individual plaquettes. We systematically investigate the spin polarization phenomenon under various input conditions, examining its dependence on network size, system temperature, and the magnetic flux threading each plaquette. Due to the network's geometry, we identify a sharply localized, highly degenerate energy level coexisting with conducting states. By tuning physical parameters, a small energy gap can be established between these degenerate localized states and the conducting energy band, enabling spin-specific $p$-type and $n$-type semiconducting behavior. Our findings offer a novel approach for designing future spintronic devices based on similar antiferromagnetic networks.

Title: Ultrafast demagnetization dynamics of 4f antiferromagnets
Authors: Maryna Pankratova, Vladislav Borisov, Danny Thonig, Rohit Pathak, Yoav William Windsor, Laurenz Rettig, Olle Eriksson, Arthur Ernst, Anders Bergman
Abstract: We study the ultrafast demagnetization dynamics of LnRh$_2$Si$_2$ (Ln $=$ Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho) antiferromagnets (AFM) after excitation by a laser pulse, using a combination of density functional theory and atomistic spin and spin-lattice dynamics simulations. First, we calculate the Heisenberg interactions using the magnetic force theorem and compare two approaches, where the $4f$ states of the rare earths are treated as frozen core states or as valence states with added correlation corrections. We find marked quantitative differences in terms of predicted Curie temperature for most of the systems, especially for those with large orbital moment of the rare earth cations. This can be attributed to the importance of indirect interactions of the $4f$ states through the Si states, which depend on the binding energy of the $4f$ states and coexists with RKKY-type interactions mediated by the conduction states. However, qualitatively, both approaches agree in terms of the predicted AFM ordering at low temperatures. In the second step, the atomistic dynamics simulations are combined with a heat-conserving two-temperature model, allowing for the calculation of spin and electronic temperatures during the magnetization dynamics simulations. Despite quite different demagnetization times, magnetization dynamics of all studied LnRh$_2$Si$_2$ AFM exhibit similar two-step behavior, in particular, the first fast drop followed by slower demagnetization. We observe that the demagnetization amplitude depends linearly on laser fluence for low fluences, which is in agreement with experimental observations. We also investigate the impact of lattice dynamics on ultrafast demagnetization using coupled atomistic spin-lattice dynamics simulations and a heat-conserving three-temperature model, which confirm linear dependence of magnetisation on laser fluence.

Title: Semiconducting behaviors at epitaxial Ca0.5TaO3 interfaces
Authors: Guangdong Nie, Guanghui Han, Shengpu Huang, Huiyin Wu, Deshun Wang, Kangxi Liu, Hao Ding, Fangdong Tang, Licong Peng, Dashuai Ma, Young Sun, Changjiang Liu, Deshun Hong
Abstract: Emergent phenomena take place in symmetry-breaking systems, notably the recently discovered two-dimensional electron gas and its tunable superconductivities near the KTaO3 interfaces. Here, we synthesized perovskite Ca0.5TaO3 films along both [001] and [111] orientations. Different from the KTaO3 system, Ca0.5TaO3 films show semiconducting behaviors when capped with LaAlO3 films in both [001] and [111] orientations. By growing films at higher temperatures, more oxygen vacancies can be introduced, and the carrier density can be tuned from ~ 1014 cm-2 to ~ 1016 cm-2. Another difference is that the superconducting transition temperature Tc in KTaO3 (111) increases linearly along with its carrier density, while the Ca0.5TaO3 (111) remains semiconducting when carrier density ranges from ~ 1014 cm-2 to ~ 1016 cm-2. Based on the density function theory calculation, Ca0.5TaO3 and KTaO3 show similar electronic band structures. According to the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, we found heavy Sr diffusion from the substrate to the Ca0.5TaO3 layer, which may destroy the interfacial conductivity. Our work demonstrates that besides the oxygen vacancies, electronic transport is sensitive to the atomic intermixing near the interface in tantulates.

Title: Three Magnetization Peaks in HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_8$ Single Crystals
Authors: Yongze Ye, Yuhao Liu, Wenshan Hong, Yuan Li, Hai-Hu Wen
Abstract: By measuring magnetization hysteresis loops of the superconducting HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_8$ single crystals ($T_{\rm c}$ = 133 K), we observed three magnetization peaks in a wide temperature region. This is in contrast to the previous observation that there are only two magnetization peaks in many superconductors. Detailed analysis finds that the second peak here evolves from a kinky structure at low temperatures and gets enhanced at high temperatures; the third peak evolves from a general broad peak at low temperatures and evolves into a sharp peak and even a step-like one at high temperatures. We propose a general phase diagram to interpret these peaks, the second peak is corresponding to the order-disorder transition, while the third peak is associated with the elastic-plastic crossover. Our work unifies the understanding of different "second peak" structures in different systems and thus sheds new light in understanding the vortex dynamics in type-II superconductors.

Title: Investigation of Softer Lattice Dynamics in Defect Engineered GeTe Crystals
Authors: Saptak Majumder, Pintu Singha, Sharath Kumar C., Mayanak K. Gupta, Dharmendra Kumar, R. Mittal, D. K. Shukla, M.P Saravanan, Deepshikha Jaiswal-Nagar, Vinayak B. Kamble
Abstract: In this paper, we investigated the low-temperature lattice dynamics in two GeTe crystals with varying Ge defect stoichiometry. The X-ray Diffraction (XRD) of the as-cleaved ingots indicate that the orientation is mainly along the h0l direction. From the Raman spectra, a comparison of the linewidth variation with temperature for the in-plane (E-mode) vibrations reveals a subtle enhancement around 170 K for the less stoichiometric crystal, depicting a more anharmonic nature, via the 4-phonon scattering processes. Furthermore, a comparison of the out-of-plane A_T^1 mode indicates a sensitivity of a weaker Raman signal ( about 239 cm -1) from disordered GeTe4 tetrahedra that has adversely affected the mode dynamics in the less stoichiometric sample (S1). However, this weaker signal is not observed for the more stoichiometric sample (S2) below 200 K. The Machine Learned Molecular Dynamics (MLMD) simulations performed to calculate the phonon spectral densities reveal that the heavier atom, Te dominate below 100 cm-1, while, the lighter Ge has more significant contribution above 100 cm-1. Thus, the change observed only in the 120 cm-1 (A_T^1) mode is justified by defects at the Ge sites. Specific heat capacity measurements are performed that show a broad hump near 14 K, when plotted as Cp/T^3 versus T indicative of a non-Debye nature. Hence, considering the two optical modes in the Raman spectra, a Debye and two-Einstein modes model is conceptualized to explain the low-temperature specific heat. These calculations reveal a softer bonding vis-a-vis lowering of Debye temperature in S1. Lower Einstein temperatures are also observed in S1, which is attributed to the easy activation of these localized modes that affect the harmonicity of the lattice. Finally, the low-temperature resistivity measurements reveal a reduction in the effective phonon frequency (w_e) through the estimation of Te.

Title: Understanding Magnesium Dissolution through Machine Learn-ing Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Zhoulin Liu, Jianchun Sha, Guang-Ling Song, Ziliang Wang, Yinghe Zhang
Abstract: Magnesium alloys have become increasingly important for various potential industrial applications, especially in energy storage, due to their outstanding properties. However, a clear under-standing of the dissolution mechanism of magnesium in the most common aqueous environments re-mains a critical challenge, hindering the broader application of magnesium alloys. To address pending key controversies in magnesium alloys research, the atomic-scale hydrogen evolution process and dis-solution mechanism of magnesium were investigated by combining machine learning molecular dy-namics with density functional theory. These controversies include the presence of magnesium reaction intermediates, the formation of uni-positive Mg+, the specific reaction steps involved in hydrogen evo-lution and magnesium dissolution, and the generation and growth mechanisms of the surface films. The results indicate that the intermediate species in the magnesium dissolution process is solid-phase MgOH, which exhibits an MgO-like structure. The magnesium in MgOH is identified as the widely recognized uni-positive Mg+. The intermediate film is formed, consisting primarily of the MgOH phase with a small amount of MgO. This film grows inward by extending into the magnesium substrate. Un-der sufficient water availability, the film undergoes further oxidation to form Mg(OH)2. These findings highlight the critical role of the MgOH phase in the magnesium dissolution process, leading to the pro-posal of a dissolution model based on MgOH/MgO solid phases as intermediates. These insights deep-en the understanding of magnesium dissolution, pave the way for the development of more effective anti-corrosion strategies for magnesium alloys, and may also advance the utilization of magnesium in energy storage applications.

Title: Anomalies in the electronic, magnetic and thermal behavior near the Invar compositions of Fe-Ni alloys

Abstract: The structural and magnetic properties of Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$~($x$ = 0.32, 0.36, 0.40, 0.50) alloys have been investigated using synchrotron based x-ray diffraction (XRD) technique with x-rays of wavelength 0.63658 Å down to 50 K temperature, magnetic measurement using superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer and high resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with monochromatic AlK$_\alpha$ radiation. The XRD studies suggest a single phase with fcc structure for $x$ = 0.36, 0.40, and 0.50 ~alloys and a mixed phase for $x$ = 0.32 alloy containing both bcc and fcc structures. The lattice parameter of the alloys exhibits a linear dependence on temperature giving rise to a temperature independent coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). The lowest CTE is observed for $x$ = 0.36 Invar alloy as expected while $x$ = 0.50 alloy exhibits the highest CTE among the alloys studied. The CTE of the fcc component of mixed phase alloy is close to that of Invar alloy. The temperature dependence of magnetization of the alloys down to 2 K reveals an overall antiferromagnetic interactions within the ferromagnetic phase causing the magnetization decreasing with cooling. The field cooled and zero field cooled data show larger differences for the Invar compositions; this is also manifested in the magnetic hysteresis data at 2 K and 300 K.

Title: Wrapping nonspherical vesicles at bio-membranes
Authors: Ajit Kumar Sahu, Rajkumar Malik, Jiarul Midya
Abstract: The wrapping of particles and vesicles by lipid bilayer membranes is a fundamental process in cellular transport and targeted drug delivery. Here, we investigate the wrapping behavior of nonspherical vesicles, such as ellipsoidal, prolate, oblate, and stomatocytes, by systematically varying the bending rigidity of the vesicle membrane and the tension of the planar membrane. Using the Helfrich Hamiltonian, triangulated membrane models, and energy minimization techniques, we predict multiple stable wrapping states and identify the conditions for their coexistence. Our results demonstrate that softer vesicles bind more easily to planar membranes; however, achieving complete wrapping requires significantly higher adhesion strengths compared to rigid particles. As membrane tension increases, deep-wrapped states disappear at a triple point where shallow-wrapped, deep-wrapped, and complete-wrapped states coexist. The coordinates of the triple point are highly sensitive to the vesicle shape and stiffness. For stomatocytes, increasing stiffness shifts the triple point to higher adhesion strengths and membrane tensions, while for oblates it shifts to lower values, influenced by shape changes during wrapping. Oblate shapes are preferred in shallow-wrapped states and stomatocytes in deep-wrapped states. In contrast to hard particles, where optimal adhesion strength for complete wrapping occurs at tensionless membranes, complete wrapping of soft vesicles requires finite membrane tension for optimal adhesion strength. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between vesicle deformability, shape, and membrane properties, advancing our understanding of endocytosis and the design of advanced biomimetic delivery systems.

Title: Filtering Spin and Orbital Moment in Centrosymmetric Systems
Authors: Luciano Jacopo DOnofrio, Maria Teresa Mercaldo, Wojciech Brzezicki, Adam Klosinski, Federico Mazzola, Carmine Ortix, Mario Cuoco
Abstract: The control of spin and orbital angular momentum without relying on magnetic materials is commonly accomplished by breaking of inversion symmetry, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and spin selectivity in electron transfer processes occurring in chiral media. In contrast to this perspective, we show that orbital moment filtering can be accomplished in centrosymmetric systems: the electron states can be selectively manipulated allowing for the preferential transfer of electrons with a particular orbital momentum orientation. We find that orbital moment filtering is indeed efficiently controlled through orbital couplings that break both mirror and rotational symmetries. We provide the symmetry conditions required for the electron transmission medium to achieve orbital filtering and relate them to the orientation of the orbital moment. The presence of atomic spin-orbit interaction in the centrosymmetric transmission medium leads to the selective filtering of spin and orbital moments. Our findings allow to identify optimal regimes for having highly efficient simultaneous spin and orbital moment filtering.

Title: Exceptionally High Nonlinear Optical Response in Two-dimensional Type II Dirac Semimetal Nickel di-Telluride (NiTe2)
Authors: Saswata Goswami, Caique Campos de Oliveira, Bruno Ipaves, Preeti Lata Mahapatra, Varinder Pal, Suman Sarkar, Pedro A. S. Autreto, Samit K. Ray, Chandra Sekhar Tiwary
Abstract: Nickel ditelluride (NiTe2) is a newly identified Type-II Dirac semimetal, showing novel characteristics in electronic transport and optical experiments. In this study, we explored the nonlinear optical properties of two-dimensional NiTe2 using experimental and computational techniques (density functional theory-based approach). Few layered two-dimensional NiTe2 (2D-NiTe2) are synthesized using liquid phase exfoliation (LPE), which is characterized using X-ray diffraction technique, transmission electron, and atomic force microscopy. The nonlinear refractive index and third-order nonlinear susceptibility of the prepared 2D-NiTe2 are determined from the self-induced diffraction pattern generated using different wavelengths ( 405, 532, and 650 nm) in the far field. In addition, the diffraction pattern generated by spatial self-phase modulation (SSPM) is further verified by varying concentration (2D-NiTe2 in the IPA solvent), wavelength (of incoming laser beams), and cuvette width (active path length). The high value of third-order nonlinear susceptibility (in order of 10-9 e.s.u.) determined using SSPM in the 2D-NiTe2 can be attributed to the laser-induced hole coherence effect. Lastly, utilizing the reverse saturable absorption property of 2D-hBN, asymmetric light propagation is also demonstrated in the 2D-NiTe2/2D-hBN heterostructure.

Title: Circular Dichroism in Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering: Probing Altermagnetic Domains in MnTe
Authors: D. Takegami, T. Aoyama, T. Okauchi, T. Yamaguchi, S. Tippireddy, S. Agrestini, M. García-Fernández, T. Mizokawa, K. Ohgushi, Ke-Jin Zhou, J. Chaloupka, J. Kuneš, A. Hariki, H. Suzuki
Abstract: X-ray magnetic circular dichroism provides a means to identify ferromagnetic, chiral, and altermagnetic orders via their time-reversal-symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$) breaking. However, differentiating magnetic domains related by crystallographic symmetries remains a technical challenge. Here we reveal a circular dichroism (CD) in the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra from the altermagnetic MnTe. The azimuthal dependence of the RIXS-CD intensity of the magnon excitations indicates a dominant occupation of a single altermagnetic domain. The RIXS-CD in our scattering geometry is ascribed to the mirror-symmetry breaking associated with the $\mathcal{T}$-broken altermagnetic order. Our results establish RIXS-CD as a domain-sensitive probe of elementary excitations in quantum materials.

Title: Enhancing catalyst activity of two-dimensional C$_4$N$_2$ through doping for the hydrogen evolution reaction
Authors: Bruno Ipaves, João F. Justo, James M. de Almeida, Lucy V. C. Assali, Pedro Alves da Silva Autreto
Abstract: This study investigates the structural, electronic, and catalytic properties of pristine and doped C$_4$N$_2$ nanosheets as potential electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The pristine C$_{36}$N$_{18}$ nanosheets exhibit limited HER activity, primarily due to high positive Gibbs free energies ($>$ 2.2 eV). To enhance catalytic performance, doping with B, Si, or P at the nitrogen site was explored. Among these systems, B-doped C$_{36}$N$_{17}$ nanosheets exhibit the most promising catalytic activity, with a Gibbs free energy close to zero ($\approx$ -0.2 eV), indicating efficient hydrogen adsorption. Band structure, projected density of states, charge density, and Bader charge analyses reveal significant changes in the electronic environment due to doping. While stacking configurations (AA$'$A$''$ and ABC) have minimal effect on catalytic performance, doping - particularly with B -substantially alters the electronic structure, optimizing hydrogen adsorption and facilitating efficient HER. These findings suggest that B-doped C$_{36}$N$_{17}$ nanosheets could serve as efficient cocatalysts when combined with metallic materials, offering a promising approach to enhance catalytic efficiency in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications.

Title: Spin-orbital mixing in the topological ladder of the two-dimensional metal PtTe$_2$

Abstract: We visualize the topological ladder and band inversions in PtTe$_2$ using spin-polarized photoemission spectroscopy augmented by three-dimensional momentum imaging. This approach enables the detection of spin polarization in dispersive bands and provides access to topological properties beyond the reach of conventional methods. Extensive mapping of spin-momentum space reveals distinct topological surface states, including a surface Dirac cone at the binding energy $E_B \sim 2.3$ eV and additional states at $E_B \sim 1.6$ eV, $E_B \sim 1.0$ eV, and near the Fermi level. The electronic structure analysis demonstrates strong hybridization between Pt and Te atomic orbitals, confirming the nontrivial topology of these surface states. Furthermore, by comparison to one-step model photoemission calculations, we identify a robust correlation between the initial-state and measured spin polarizations while revealing asymmetries in specific experimental spin textures. These asymmetries, absent in the initial states due to symmetry constraints, arise from the breaking of time-reversal symmetry during the photoemission process, emphasizing the crucial influence of symmetries on experimental signatures of topology.

Title: On the fluctuations of the number of atoms in the condensate
Authors: Maciej B. Kruk, Piotr Kulik, Malthe F. Andersen, Piotr Deuar, Mariusz Gajda, Krzysztof Pawłowski, Emilia Witkowska, Jan J. Arlt, Kazimierz Rzążewski
Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensation represents a remarkable phase transition, characterized by the formation of a single quantum subsystem. As a result, the statistical properties of the condensate are highly unique. In the case of a Bose gas, while the mean number of condensed atoms is independent of the choice of statistical ensemble, the microcanonical, canonical, or grand canonical variances differ significantly among these ensembles. In this paper, we review the progress made over the past 30 years in studying the statistical fluctuations of Bose-Einstein condensates. Focusing primarily on the ideal Bose gas, we emphasize the inequivalence of the Gibbs statistical ensembles and examine various approaches to this problem. These approaches include explicit analytic results for primarily one-dimensional systems, methods based on recurrence relations, asymptotic results for large numbers of particles, techniques derived from laser theory, and methods involving the construction of statistical ensembles via stochastic processes, such as the Metropolis algorithm. We also discuss the less thoroughly resolved problem of the statistical behavior of weakly interacting Bose gases. In particular, we elaborate on our stochastic approach, known as the hybrid sampling method. The experimental aspect of this field has gained renewed interest, especially following groundbreaking recent measurements of condensate fluctuations. These advancements were enabled by unprecedented control over the total number of atoms in each experimental realization. Additionally, we discuss the fluctuations in photonic condensates as an illustrative example of grand canonical fluctuations. Finally, we briefly consider the future directions for research in the field of condensate statistics.

Title: Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in superconducting hybrid systems
Authors: A. A. Mazanik, Tim Kokkeler, I. V. Tokatly, F. Sebastian Bergeret
Abstract: We investigate the effects of interfacial spin-orbit coupling (ISOC) on superconductors, focusing on its impact on electronic transport and spin-charge conversion. Using a symmetry-based nonlinear sigma model, we derive effective boundary conditions for the Usadel and Maxwell equations that account for spin-galvanic effect, spin relaxation, and spin precession. This approach allows for the analysis of various interfaces without relying on specific microscopic models. We apply these boundary conditions to derive ISOC-induced terms in the Ginzburg-Landau functional, which is then used to compute the critical temperature of superconducting films with ISOC subjected to an external magnetic field. Our findings show that, contrary to a recent prediction, the critical temperature of a film cannot be enhanced by an external magnetic field. Additionally, we demonstrate that the combination of ISOC and an external magnetic field leads to a superconducting diode effect. Its efficiency strongly depends on the interplay between the spin-galvanic and the spin relaxation terms. Our results provide a framework for understanding ISOC in superconducting systems and highlight the potential for optimizing diode efficiency through careful interface engineering

Title: Signature of glassy dynamics in dynamic modes decompositions
Authors: Zachary G. Nicolaou, Hangjun Cho, Yuanzhao Zhang, J. Nathan Kutz, Steven L. Brunton
Abstract: Glasses are traditionally characterized by their rugged landscape of disordered low-energy states and their slow relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium. Far from equilibrium, dynamical forms of glassy behavior with anomalous algebraic relaxation have also been noted, e.g., in networks of coupled oscillators. Due to their disordered and high-dimensional nature, such systems have been difficult to study analytically, but data-driven methods are emerging as a promising alternative that may aid in their characterization. Here, we show that the gap between oscillatory and decaying modes in the Koopman spectrum vanishes in systems exhibiting algebraic relaxation. The dynamic mode decomposition, which is a data-driven spectral computation that approximates the Koopman spectrum, thus provides a model-agnostic signature for detecting and analyzing glassy dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through both a minimal example of one-dimensional ODEs and a high-dimensional example of coupled oscillators.

Title: Egg yolk as a model for gelation: from rheometry to flow physics
Authors: Maxwell Marsh, Mohammad Tanver Hossain, Randy Ewoldt
Abstract: Egg yolks are an excellent model for studying sol-gel transitions, particularly the power law viscoelasticity that defines the critical point of gelation. However, prior studies lack comprehensive datasets and fail to visualize flow behavior linked to temperature and time-dependent linear and nonlinear rheology. Here we present a detailed dataset characterizing egg yolk viscoelasticity across temperature, time, and forcing amplitude using oscillatory shear, step strain, step stress, and constant high strain rate. Novel protorheology visualizations link rheological properties with observable flow behavior. Our findings highlight the nuanced determination of the critical gel point, emphasizing observation timescale dependencies. We compare methods to identify critical temperatures for gelation, including power law viscoelasticity, moduli crossover, diverging zero-shear viscosity, and emerging equilibrium elastic modulus, while visualizing flow consequences near these transitions. Egg yolk is an accessible non-toxic material relevant to the physicist and the chef alike, making it ideal for understanding the rheology of critical gels. By integrating protorheology photos and videos with rigorous rheometric data, we deepen the understanding of critical gels, with broader impacts for teaching and modeling sol-gel transitions.

Title: Orbital Signatures of Density Wave Transition in La3Ni2O7-delta and La2PrNi2O7-delta RP-Nickelates Probed via in-situ X-ray Absorption Near-edge Spectroscopy
Authors: Mingtao Li, Mingxin Zhang, Yiming Wang, Jiayi Guan, Nana Li, Cuiying Pei, N-Diaye Adama, Qingyu Kong, Yanpeng Qi, Wenge Yang
Abstract: The report of superconductivity (SC) with Tc~80 K in bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La3Ni2O7-delta have sparked considerable investigations on its normal state properties and SC mechanism under pressure and at low temperature. It is believed that the density wave (DW) at ~150 K plays an important role in SC emergence, but its nature remains largely underexplored. Here, we utilized temperature-dependent in-situ Ni K-edge X-ray Absorption Near-edge Spectroscopy (XANES) to probe the Ni-3d/4p electronic states of La3Ni2O7-delta and La2PrNi2O7-delta samples down to 4.8 K, enabling us to witness the evolution of both in-plane d_(x^2-y^2)/p_x (p_y) and out-of-plane d_(3z^2-r^2)/p_z orbitals of NiO6 octahedron across the DW transition. Main edge energy associated with Ni 4p orbital shows an anomalous decline near DW transition, signifying the occurrence of lattice distortions as a hallmark of charge density wave. Below DW transition, the enlarged crystal field splitting (CFS) indicates an enhanced NiO6 octahedral distortion. Intriguingly, magnetic Pr substituents could activate the mutual interplay of d_(x^2-y^2) and d_(3z^2-r^2) orbitals. We discussed its relevance to the favored bulk SC in the pressurized polycrystalline La2PrNi2O7-delta than pristine.

Title: Density-dependent spin susceptibility and effective mass in monolayer MoSe2
Authors: Chang Liu, Tongtong Jia, Zheng Sun, Yu Gu, Fan Xu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jinfeng Jia, Shiyong Wang, Xiaoxue Liu, Tingxin Li
Abstract: Atomically thin MoSe2 is a promising platform for investigating quantum phenomena due to its large effective mass, high crystal quality, and strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we demonstrate a triple-gate device design with bismuth contacts, enabling reliable ohmic contact down to low electron densities, with a maximum Hall mobility of approximately 22,000 cm2/Vs. Low-temperature transport measurements illustrate metal-insulator transitions, and density-dependent quantum oscillation sequences. Enhanced spin susceptibility and density-dependent effective mass are observed, attributed to interaction effects and valley polarization. These findings establish monolayer MoSe2 as a versatile platform for further exploring interaction-driven quantum states.

Title: Itinerant topological magnons and spin excitons in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides: Mapping electron topology to spin counterpart
Authors: Wei-Tao Zhou, Zhao-Yang Dong, Zhao-Long Gu, Jian-Xin Li
Abstract: Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs) provide a highly tunable platform to explore the interplay between strong correlation and topology. Among them, the properties involving the charge degree of freedom have been extensively studied, while those related to spin are much less investigated. Motivated by the recent discovery of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in tMoTe$_2$, where the flat-band ferromagnetism is one of the essential prerequisites, we investigate theoretically the spin excitations out of the flat-band ferromagnetic ground state in tMoTe$_2$. Remarkably, we identify the itinerant magnons and spin excitons with nontrivial topology. We elaborate that the topology of these itinerant spin excitations, which are described as particle-hole bound states, inherits directly from that of the underlying electrons and is essentially different from that in local spin systems. Thus, we establish a direct relationship of the topology between the many-body excitations and their fundamental constituents. We further demonstrate that by tuning the displacement field, a topological transition for both the magnon and spin exciton happens, leading to a step-like change and bifurcation in the thermal Hall conductance, which could serve as unique and compelling evidence to be tested experimentally.

Title: Dimension Effect of Nanocarbon Precursors on Diamond Synthesis and Transformation Mechanism under Extreme Conditions
Authors: Jiaxin Ming, Jingyi Tian, Liming Zhao, Jiayin Li, Guoshuai Du, Lixing Kang, Zheng Hu, Yabin Chen
Abstract: Diamond holds significant promise for a wide range of applications due to its exceptional physicochemical properties. Investigating the controlled diamond preparation from nanocarbon precursors with varying dimensions is crucial to optimize the transition conditions and even elucidate the daunting transformation mechanism, however, this remains outstanding challenge despite considerable effort. Herein, we report the imperative dimension effect of nanocarbon precursors on diamond synthesis and physical mechanism under high temperature and high pressure, by comparing the distinct transition processes of zero-dimensional (0D) carbon nanocages (CNCs) and one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from conventional graphite. The optical and structural characterizations evidently demonstrated that both 0D CNCs and 1D CNTs first undergo collapse and graphitization, followed by the formation of mixed amorphous carbon with embedded diamond clusters, eventually leading to cubic diamond. The plotted pressure-temperature diagram exhibits the unique dimension effect of carbon nanomaterials to diamond transformation. These results provide valuable insights into the phase transition mechanisms of diamond synthesis and its derivatives under extreme conditions.

Title: Anisotropic Schottky-barrier-height in high-symmetry 2D WSe$_2$: Momentum-space anisotropy
Authors: Nuo Xu, Xiao-Lin Zhao, Meng-Xue Ren, Ke-Xin Hou, Xiao-huan Lv, Rui-Ning Wang, Xing-Qiang Shi, Jiang-Long Wang
Abstract: It is usually supposed that only low-symmetry two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit anisotropy, here we show that high-symmetry 2D semiconductors can show significant anisotropy in momentum space due to the band structure anisotropy in k-space. The basic reason is that different k-points in the Brillouin zone have different symmetry. Using 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$ as the example, we construct lateral heterostructures with zigzag and armchair connections to 2D metal NbSe$_2$, and the electronic structure and contact characteristics of these two connections are analyzed. It is found that both connections exhibit p-type Schottky barrier height (SBH) but the sizes of SBH are very different (of 0.03 eV and 0.50 eV), mainly because the band-edge energies of WSe$_2$ are different along the two mutually perpendicular directions in momentum space. There are two factors contributing to the SBH anisotropy: one is the different interface structure and the other is the band edge anisotropy of the 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$. Since the two interface structures give only a difference in interface potential change by less than 0.1 eV, the SBH variation of ~0.47 eV is mainly from the band structure anisotropy in momentum-space. So, high-symmetry 2D materials may exhibit highly anisotropic electronic states in momentum space and this affects the transport properties. Our current work extends the research field of 2D material anisotropy to 2D materials with high real-space symmetry, thus greatly expands the candidate materials for anisotropic studies and provides new guidance for optimizing the performance of 2D material devices via controlling transport directions.

Title: Topological magnons and domain walls in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$
Authors: Wen-Xuan Qiu, Fengcheng Wu
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the magnetic excitations in the quantum anomalous Hall insulator phase of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at a hole filling factor of $\nu=1$, focusing on magnon and domain wall excitations. Using a generalized interacting Kane-Mele model, we obtain the quantum anomalous Hall insualtor ground state with spin polarization. The magnon spectrum is then computed via the Bethe-Salpeter equation, revealing two low-energy topological magnon bands with opposite Chern numbers. To further explore the magnon topology, we construct a tight-binding model for the magnon bands, which is analogous to the Haldane model. We also calculate the energy cost of domain walls that separate regions with opposite Chern numbers and bind chiral edge states. Finally, we propose an effective spin model that describes both magnon and domain wall excitations, incorporating Heisenberg spin interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. The coupling constants in this model are determined from the numerical results for magnons and domain walls. This model accounts for the Ising anisotropy of the system, captures the magnon topology, and allows for the estimation of the magnetic ordering temperature. Our findings provide a comprehensive analysis of magnetic excitations in twisted MoTe$_2$ and offer new insights into collective excitations in moiré systems.

Title: Organometallic-Inorganic Hybrid MXenes with Tunable Superconductivity

Abstract: Ti-based two-dimensional transition-metal carbides (MXenes) have attracted attention due to their superior properties and are being explored across various applications1,2. Despite their versatile properties, superconductivity has never been demonstrated, not even predicted, for this important group of 2D materials. In this work, we have introduced an electrochemical intercalation protocol to construct versatile organometallic-inorganic hybrid MXenes and achieved tunable superconductivity in the metallocene-modified layered crystals. Through structural editing of MXene matrix at atomic scale and meticulously modulated intercalation route, Ti3C2Tx intercalated with metallocene species exhibits a superconductive transition temperature (Tc) of 10.2 K. Guest intercalation induced electron filling and strain engineering are responsible for the emerging superconductivity in this intrinsically non-superconducting material. Theoretically, simulated electron-phonon interaction effects further elucidate the nature of the changes in Tc. Furthermore, the Tc of crafted artificial superlattices beyond Ti-based MXenes have been predicted, offering a general strategy for engineering superconductivity and magnetism in layered hybrid materials.

Title: Nonlocal Electrical Detection of Reciprocal Orbital Edelstein Effect
Authors: Weiguang Gao, Liyang Liao, Hironari Isshiki, Nico Budai, Junyeon Kim, Hyun-Woo Lee, Kyung-Jin Lee, Dongwook Go, Yuriy Mokrousov, Shinji Miwa, Yoshichika Otani
Abstract: Spin-Orbitronics leverages the spin and orbital degrees of freedom in solids for information processing. The orbital Edelstein effect and orbital Hall effect, where the charge current induces a nonequilibrium orbital angular momentum, offer a promising method to manipulate nanomagnets efficiently using light elements. Despite extensive research, understanding the Onsager reciprocity of orbital transport, fundamentally rooted in the second law of thermodynamics and time-reversal symmetry, remains elusive. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the Onsager reciprocity of orbital transport in an orbital Edelstein system by utilizing nonlocal measurements. This method enables the precise identification of the chemical potential generated by orbital accumulation, avoiding the limitations associated with local measurements. Remarkably, we observe that the direct and inverse orbital-charge conversion processes produce identical electric voltages, confirming Onsager reciprocity in orbital transport. Additionally, we find that the orbital decay length, approximately 100 nm at room temperature, is independent of Cu thickness and decreases with lowering temperature, revealing a distinct contrast to spin transport behavior. Our findings provide valuable insights into both the reciprocity of the charge-orbital interconversion and the nonlocal correlation of orbital degree of freedom, laying the ground for orbitronics devices with long-range interconnections.

Title: Electrothermal manipulation of current-induced phase transitions in ferrimagnetic Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$
Authors: Jiaqi Fang, Jiawei Hu, Xintian Chen, Yaotian Liu, Zheng Yin, Zhe Ying, Yunhao Wang, Ziqiang Wang, Zhilin Li, Shiyu Zhu, Yang Xu, Sokrates T. Pantelides, Hong-Jun Gao
Abstract: Phase transitions driven by external stimuli are central to condensed matter physics, providing critical insights into symmetry breaking and emergent phenomena. Recently, ferrimagnetic (FiM) Mn3Si2Te6 has attracted considerable attention for its magnetic-field-induced insulator-metal transitions (IMTs) and unconventional current-driven phase transitions, yet the role of applied currents in the magnetic phase remains poorly understood. Here, by combining local magnetization probes and time-resolved transport measurements, we uncover an electrothermal origin for the current-induced first-order-like phase transitions, characterized by abrupt voltage jumps and distinct magnetic domain evolution. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics measured under triangular waveforms exhibit strong non- reciprocal and hysteretic behaviors, which are significantly suppressed at frequencies ~1000 Hz. Time-resolved studies using rectangular pulsed currents demonstrate that the resistance dynamics closely mirror the equilibrium resistance-temperature profile, directly implicating Joule heating as the driving mechanism. Furthermore, we reveal that the intrinsic I-V response adheres to Ohm's law, displaying linearity across various magnetic fields and temperatures. Our work advocates for a cautious approach in distinguishing between genuine current-induced nonequilibrium quantum states and thermal effects.

Title: Spin-chirality-driven second-harmonic generation in two-dimensional magnet CrSBr
Authors: Dezhao Wu, Yong Xu, Meng Ye, Wenhui Duan
Abstract: The interplay between magnetism and light can create abundant optical phenomena. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of an unconventional magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation (MSHG) stemming from vector spin chirality, denoted as chiral second-harmonic generation (SHG). Taking the antiferromagnetic (AFM) CrSBr bilayer as a prototype, we theoretically show that, via spin canting, the chiral SHG can be continuously tuned from zero to a value one order of magnitude larger than its intrinsic MSHG. Remarkably, chiral SHG is found to be proportional to spin chirality and spin-canting-induced electric polarization, while intrinsic MSHG is proportional to the Néel vector, demonstrating their different physical mechanisms. Additionally, we reveal a unique interference effect between these two types of MSHG under the reversal of spin-canting direction, generating a giant modulation of SHG signals. Our work not only uncovers a unique SHG with exceptional tunability but also promotes the applications of AFM optical devices and magnetoelectric detection techniques.

Title: Imaging current flow and injection in scalable graphene devices through NV-magnetometry
Authors: Kaj Dockx, Michele Buscema, Saravana Kumar, Tijmen van Ree, Abbas Mohtashami, Leon van Dooren, Gabriele Bulgarini, Richard van Rijn, Clara I. Osorio, Toeno van der Sar
Abstract: The global electronic properties of solid-state devices are strongly affected by the microscopic spatial paths of charge carriers. Visualising these paths in novel devices produced by scalable processes would provide a quality assessment method that can propel the device performance metrics towards commercial use. Here, we use high-resolution nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry to visualise the charge flow in gold-contacted, single-layer graphene devices produced by scalable methods. Modulating the majority carrier type via field effect reveals a strong asymmetry between the spatial current distributions in the electron and hole regimes that we attribute to an inhomogeneous microscopic potential landscape, inaccessible to conventional measurement techniques. In addition, we observe large, unexpected, differences in charge flow through nominally identical gold-graphene contacts. Moreover, we find that the current transfer into the graphene occurs several microns before the metal contact edge. Our findings establish high-resolution NV-magnetometry as a key tool for characterizing scalable 2D material based devices, uncovering quality deficits of the material, substrate, and electrical contacts that are invisible to conventional methods.

Title: Storing quantum coherence in a quantum dot nuclear spin ensemble for over 100 milliseconds
Authors: Harry E. Dyte, Santanu Manna, Saimon F. Covre da Silva, Armando Rastelli, Evgeny A. Chekhovich
Abstract: States with long coherence are a crucial requirement for qubits and quantum memories. Nuclear spins in epitaxial quantum dots are a great candidate, offering excellent isolation from external environments and on-demand coupling to optical flying qubits. However, coherence times are limited to $\lesssim1$ ms by the dipole-dipole interactions between the nuclei and their quadrupolar coupling to inhomogeneous crystal strain. Here, we combine strain engineering of the nuclear spin ensemble and tailored dynamical decoupling sequences to achieve nuclear spin coherence times exceeding 100 ms. Recently, a reversible transfer of quantum information into nuclear spin ensembles has been demonstrated in quantum dots. Our results provide a path to develop this concept into a functioning solid-state quantum memory suitable for quantum repeaters in optical quantum communication networks.

Title: Point-group symmetry enriched topological orders
Authors: Zhaoyang Ding, Yang Qi
Abstract: We study the classification of two-dimensional (2D) topological orders enriched by point-group symmetries, by generalizing the folding appraoch which was previously developed for mirror-symmetry-enriched topological orders. We fold the 2D plane hosting the topological order into the foundamental domain of the group group, which is a sector with an angle $2\pi/n$ for the cyclic point group $C_n$ and a sector with an angle $\pi/n$ for the dihedral point group $D_{2n}$, and the point-group symmetries becomes onsite unitary symmetries on the sector. The enrichment of the point-group symmetries is then fully encoded at the boundary of the sector and the apex of the section, which forms a junction between the two boundaries. The mirror-symmetry enrichment encoded on the boundaries is analyzed by the classification theory of symmetric gapped boundaries, and the point-group-symmetry enrichment encoded on the junction is analyzed by a framework for classifying symmetric gapped junctions between boundaries which we develop in this work. We show that at the junction, there are two potential obstructions, which we refer to as an $H^1$ obstruction and an $H^2$ obstruction, respectively. When the obstruction vanishes, the junction, and therefore the point-group-symmetry-enriched topological orders, are classified by an $H^0$ cohomology class and an $H^1$ cohomology class, which can be understood as an additional Abelian anyon and a symmetry charge attached to the rotation center, respectively. These results are consistent with the classification of onsite-symmetry-enriched topological orders, where the $H^1$ and $H^2$ obstructions and the junction corresponds to the $H^3$ and $H^4$ obstructions for onsite symmetries, respectively.

Title: Charge Orders in Fully Intercalated Bilayer TaSe$_2$: Dependence on Interlayer Stacking and Intercalation Sites
Authors: Yuhui Yan, Lingxiao Xiong, Feipeng Zheng
Abstract: Recent advancements have established self-intercalation as a powerful technique for manipulating quantum material properties, with precisely controllable intercalation concentrations. Given the inherently rich phase diagrams of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), studying the self-intercalated TMDCs can offer promising candidates for investigating the interplay between various orderings. This work focuses on fully intercalated bilayer TaSe$_2$ (Ta$_3$Se$_4$), which has recently been fabricated experimentally. By performing first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the suppression of an intrinsic $3\times3$ charge density wave (CDW) in parent TaSe$_2$ layers, and the emergence of $2\times 2$, $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$, or the absence of a CDW in the intercalated layers, depending on the interlayer stacking orders and intercalation sites being occupied. Particularly, the $2\times 2$ CDW shows an increase in electronic states at the Fermi level compared to its non-CDW phase. This unusual behavior contrasts with that of typical CDW materials in TMDCs. Furthermore, superconductivity is preserved in these Ta$_3$Se$_4$ structures, with superconducting transition temperatures comparable to or substantially smaller than those of TaSe$_2$. Spin-orbit coupling is found to enhance the density of states at Fermi levels while simultaneously reducing the electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. These two competing effects result in varying impacts on superconductivity across different Ta$_3$Se$_4$ structures. Moreover, our calculations indicate that magnetic order is absent. Our study deepens the understanding of underlying physics in Ta$_3$Se$_4$, and provides experimentally feasible candidates for studying CDW, superconductivity, and their interplay.

Title: Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in nonmagnetic/noncollinear-antiferromagnetic bilayers
Authors: Yuta Yamane, Yasufumi Araki, Shunsuke Fukami
Abstract: We study Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) appearing at the interface of a nonmagnetic/noncollinear-antiferromagnetic bilayer. DMI is an antisymmetric exchange interaction between neighboring magnetic spins, arising in the absence of inversion center between the spins and the explicit expression of which being dictated by system symmetry. We formulate the interfacial DMI for different crystalline orientations of the noncollinear antiferromagnet with stacked-Kagome lattice structure. From this formulation, we show that, when the Kagome planes are perpendicular to the sample film plane, the DMI serves as a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy for the antiferromagnetic order parameter. Our findings reveal a novel physical manifestation of a DMI, shedding a new light on microscopic mechanisms of the magnetic anisotropy in noncollinear antiferromagnets.

Title: Strain engineering of valley-polarized hybrid excitons in a 2D semiconductor
Authors: Abhijeet M. Kumar, Douglas J. Bock, Denis Yagodkin, Edith Wietek, Bianca Höfer, Max Sinner, Pablo Hernández López, Sebastian Heeg, Cornelius Gahl, Florian Libisch, Alexey Chernikov, Ermin Malic, Roberto Rosati, Kirill I. Bolotin
Abstract: Encoding and manipulating digital information in quantum degrees of freedom is one of the major challenges of today's science and technology. The valley indices of excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are well-suited to address this challenge. Here, we demonstrate a new class of strain-tunable, valley-polarized hybrid excitons in monolayer TMDs, comprising a pair of energy-resonant intra- and intervalley excitons. These states combine the advantages of bright intravalley excitons, where the valley index directly couples to light polarization, and dark intervalley excitons, characterized by low depolarization rates. We demonstrate that the hybridized state of dark KK' intervalley and defect-localized excitons exhibits a degree of circular polarization of emitted photons that is three times higher than that of the constituent species. Moreover, a bright KK intravalley and a dark KQ exciton form a coherently coupled hybrid state under energetic resonance, with their valley depolarization dynamics slowed down a hundredfold. Overall, these valley-polarized hybrid excitons with strain-tunable valley character emerge as prime candidates for valleytronic applications in future quantum and information technology.

Title: Disorder-induced liquid-solid phase coexistence in 2D electron systems
Authors: Sandeep Joy, Brian Skinner
Abstract: Recent imaging experiments show a surprisingly robust regime of liquid-solid phase coexistence in a 2D electron system near the quantum melting/freezing transition, with the two phases mixed in mesoscopic domains. Strikingly, the experiments find no noticeable difference in electron density between the liquid and solid domains, which is at odds with both microemulsion scenarios and scenarios in which phase coexistence is driven by fluctuations of a long-ranged disorder potential. Here, we show that such phase coexistence without density difference can be induced by random fluctuations of a short-ranged disorder potential. We further show that disorder tends to stabilize the Wigner Crystal phase to higher densities, which is also consistent with the experiments.

Title: High-pressure floating zone crystal growth of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$
Authors: S. J. Gomez Alvarado, Y. Pang, P. A. Barrera, D. Rout, C. Robison, Z. Porter, H. Z. Porter, E. A. Lawrence, E. N. Bassey, S. D. Wilson
Abstract: Here we demonstrate the floating zone crystal growth of the $J_\mathrm{eff}=1/2$ Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. Historically, the growth of iridates from a ternary melt has been precluded by the extreme vapor pressure of the metal oxide species and the difficulty of maintaining the correct oxidation state of Ir at high temperatures. Here, we show that the application of a high-pressure oxygen growth environment stabilizes the Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ phase, leading to the first demonstration of cm$^{3}$-scale crystals. In contrast to the conventional SrCl$_2$ flux growth method, where poor control over disorder leads to strong sample dependence, the high-pressure floating zone growth enables active control over the homogeneity of the melt. Crystals grown via this technique possess qualitatively similar properties to those grown via flux, with a relatively sharp onset of antiferromagnetic order observed in temperature-dependent magnetization. Further, we demonstrate that by tuning the mixing rate of the melt, we are able to grow natively hole-doped Sr$_2$Ir$_{1-y}$O$_4$, which exhibits a strongly modified magnetic and electronic response.

Title: Correlative and in situ microscopy investigation of phase transformation, crystal growth and degradation of antimony sulfide thin films
Authors: Mingjian Wu, Maïssa K. S. Barr, Vanessa M. Koch, Martin Dierner, Tobias Dierke, Penghan Lu, Johannes Will, Rafal Dunin-Borkowski, Janina Maultsch, Julien Bachmann, Erdmann Spiecker
Abstract: Antimony sulfide (Sb$_2$S$_3$), a compound of earth-abundant elements with highly anisotropic, quasi-layered crystal structure, triggered growing interest as a solar absorber in photovoltaics and as a phase change material in memory devices, yet challenges remain in achieving high-quality thin films with controlled nucleation and growth for optimal performance. Here, we investigate the phase transformation, crystal structure and properties, growth and degradation of atomic layer deposited Sb$_2$S$_3$ thin films using in situ TEM and correlative ex situ analysis. The as-deposited amorphous films crystallized at 243°C, forming grains with an [100] out-of-plane texture and developed into tens to hundreds of micrometer, leaves-shaped grains. Introducing an ultra-thin ZnS interfacial layer increased nucleation density, and resulted in a few micrometer-sized, more uniform grains while retaining the overall [100] texture. In situ observations and subsequent crystal orientation analysis with cutting-edge 4D-STEM and EBSD revealed that the grains grew faster along the [010] ribbon direction and that the bare films underwent early-stage degradation, forming holes in amorphous regions during annealing. The ZnS interlayer mitigated degradation, stabilizing the films and improving their uniformity. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing Sb$_2$S$_3$ thin films for applications both as solar cell materials and phase change materials.

Title: 3D Electron Diffraction as GIWAXS Alternative for Quantitative Structural Characterization of Organic Solar Cells
Authors: Irene Kraus, Mingjian Wu, Stefanie Rechberger, Johannes Will, Santanu Maiti, Andreas Kuhlmann, Marten Huck, Larry Lüer, Florian Bertram, Hans-Georg Steinrück, Tobias Unruh, Christoph J. Brabec, Erdmann Spiecker
Abstract: We demonstrate elastically filtered 3D Electron Diffraction (3D ED) as a powerful alternative technique to Grazing Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) for quantitatively characterizing the structure of organic semiconductor films. Using a model material system of solvent vapor annealed DRCN5T:PC71BM thin film, which is employed in organic solar cells (OSCs), we extract the structural data obtained from 3D ED and compare with that from GIWAXS, utilizing both laboratory and synchrotron X-ray sources. Quantitative evaluation of the datasets in terms of peak positions, peak widths and mosaicity revealed good agreement between both techniques, qualifying 3D ED as an alternative tool for analyzing highly beam-sensitive organic thin films. Furthermore, the respective advantages and limitations of 3D ED and GIWAXS are discussed, emphasizing the unique capability of 3D ED to integrate seamlessly with the diverse imaging and spectroscopic modalities in modern TEM. This integration enriches the techniques of structural characterization of OSCs, paving the way for deeper insights into their structural properties and ultimately their performance.

Title: Site-Decorated Model for Unconventional Frustrated Magnets with Ultranarrow Phase Crossover and Spin Reversal Transition
Authors: Weiguo Yin
Abstract: The site-decorated Ising model is introduced to advance the understanding and physical realization of the recently discovered one-dimensional finite-temperature ultranarrow phase crossover in an external magnetic field, overcoming the complexity of the traditional bond-decorated models from geometric consideration. Furthermore, for higher-dimensional Ising models in the presence of an external magnetic field, while they remain unsolved, an exact solution about a novel spin-reversal transition -- accessible by a slight change in temperature or the magnetic field, even in the weak field limit -- is found to exist upon the site decoration. These results suggest a new route to energy-efficient applications in, e.g., data storage and processing, and call for materialization and device design with site decoration in, e.g., mixed $d$-$f$ compounds, optical lattices, or neural networks.

Title: Coherent Spin Pumping Originated from Sub-Terahertz Néel Vector Dynamics in Easy Plane α-Fe2O3/Pt
Authors: Gregory Fritjofson, Atul Regmi, Jacob Hanson-Flores, Justin Michel, Junyu Tang, Fengyuan Yang, Ran Cheng, Enrique Del Barco
Abstract: We present a thorough study of spin-to-charge current interconversion in bulk and thin films of (0001) {\alpha}-Fe2O3 /Pt heterostructures by means of all-optical polarization-controlled microwave excitation at sub-Terahertz frequencies. Our results demonstrate that coherent spin pumping is generated through excitations of both the acoustic and optical modes of antiferromagnetic resonance, provided that the corresponding selection rules are met for the relative orientation between the microwave magnetic field h_ac and the magnetic moment m_0 of the Hematite. In particular, our results unanimously show that while a microwave field with h_ac perpendicular to m_0 pumps a net spin angular momentum from the acoustic mode, spin pumping from the optical mode is only enabled when h_ac parallel to m_0, as expected from the selection rules imposed by the Neel vector dynamics. Our results support the current understanding of spin mixing conductance in antiferromagnetic/non-magnetic interfaces, contrary to recent reports where the absence of spin pumping from the optical mode in Hematite was interpreted as a cancellation effect between the diagonal and off-diagonal components of the spin mixing conductance. We also provide an explanation for the previously reported observations and show how the optical spin pumping actually vanishes for thin films, which we speculate being either due to an increased level of inhomogeneities or to insufficient film thickness for the optical mode to fully realize.

Title: Predicted versatile topological nodal magnons in the icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants
Authors: Rintaro Eto, Masahito Mochizuki, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: Using a recenly-estabilished band representation analysis, we discover two distinct types of topological nodal magnons in the real-space antiferroic ordering of whirling spin arrangements in the icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants, both of which originate from a composite band representation $A\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(24)$ and its constituent ${}^1E_g\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(8)$ (or ${}^2E_g\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(8)$). The first type is doubly-degenerate nodal line network and nodal planes associated with two-dimensional irreducible band representation, while the second type is a nodal line network due to accidental band inversions. Since our analysis, which relies solely on magnetocrystalline symmetry, is valid for a wide range of materials and spin textures belonging to the same magnetic space group irrespective of composition, these findings offer new universal insights into the research of quasicrystals and their approximants as well as a contribution to broadening the range of topological magnon-hosting materials.

Title: Active Solids: Defect Self-Propulsion Without Flow
Authors: Fridtjof Brauns, Myles O'Leary, Arthur Hernandez, Mark J. Bowick, M. Cristina Marchetti
Abstract: The self-propulsion of +1/2 topological defects is a hallmark of active nematic fluids, where the defects are advected by the flow field they themselves generate. In this paper we propose a minimal model for defect self-propulsion in a nematic active solid: a linear elastic medium with an embedded nematic texture that generates active stress and associated elastic strains. We show that such coupling gives rise to self-propelled +1/2 defects that move relative to the elastic medium by local remodeling of the nematic texture without advection. This mechanism is fundamentally different from the fluid case and can lead to unbinding of defect pairs and stabilization of +1 defects. Our findings might help explain how orientational order, of, for example, muscle fibers, is reconfigured during morphogenesis in solid-like tissues. The proposed mechanism may, for instance, control motility and merging of +1/2 defects, which play a crucial role in setting up the body axis during Hydra regeneration.

Title: Tracking Adiabaticity in Non-Equilibrium Many-Body Systems: The Hard Case of the X-ray Photoemission in Metals
Authors: G. Diniz, F. D. Picoli, L. N. Oliveira, I. D'Amico
Abstract: The level of adiabaticity determines many properties of time-dependent quantum systems. However, a reliable and easy-to-apply criterion to check and track it remains an open question, especially for complex many-body systems. Here we test techniques based on metrics which have been recently proposed to quantitatively characterize and track adiabaticity. We investigate the time evolution of x-ray photoemission in metals, which displays a strongly out-of-equilibrium character, continuum energy spectrum, and experiences the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe: a nightmarish scenario for this type of test. Our results show that the metrics-based methods remains valid. In particular, we demonstrate that the natural local density distance is able not only to track adiabaticity, but also to provide information not captured by the corresponding Bures' or trace distances about the system's dynamics. In the process, we establish an explicit upper limit for this local density distance in terms of the trace distance, and derive a simple analytical solution that accurately describes the time evolution of a Fermi gas with a localized scattering potential for a large range of parameters. We also demonstrate that, for x-ray photoemission, the quantum adiabatic criterion, as commonly used, fails to predict and track adiabaticity. The local particle density is typically much simpler to compute than the corresponding quantum state and it is experimentally measurable: this makes the method tested extremely appealing.

Title: Microscopic contact line dynamics dictate the emergent behaviors of particle rafts
Authors: Ranit Mukherjee, Zih-Yin Chen, Xiang Cheng, Sungyon Lee
Abstract: Fluid-fluid interfaces laden with discrete particles behave curiously like continuous elastic sheets, leading to their applications in emulsion and foam stabilization. Although existing continuum models can qualitatively capture the elastic buckling of these particle-laden interfaces -- often referred to as particle rafts -- under compression, they fail to link their macroscopic collective properties to the microscopic behaviors of individual particles. Thus, phenomena such as particle expulsion from the compressed rafts remain unexplained. Here, by combining systematic experiments with first-principle modeling, we reveal how the macroscopic mechanical properties of particle rafts emerge from particle-scale interactions. We construct a phase diagram that delineates the conditions under which a particle raft collapses via collective folding versus single-particle expulsion. Guided by this theoretical framework, we demonstrate control over the raft's failure mode by tuning the physicochemical properties of individual particles. Our study highlights the previously overlooked dual nature of particle rafts and exemplifies how collective dynamics can arise from discrete components with simple interactions.

Title: Time-dependent approach to the X-ray photoemission problem
Authors: F. D. Picoli, G. Diniz, M. P. Lenzarini, I. D'Amico, L. N. Oliveira
Abstract: X-ray photoemission from simple metals has been thoroughly studied, experimentally, and theoretically, in the frequency domain. Here we investigate the same problem in the time domain, with the ultimate purpose of improving the numerical renormalization-group method. We focus our study on the time dependence of the photoemission current $\mathcal{F}(t)$, a fidelity, in the terminology of quantum information. To establish benchmarks, we first calculate $\mathcal{F}(t)$ analytically and numerically for a tight-binding model. Analytically, we derive an approximate expression that becomes very precise at large times. Numerically, we diagonalize the tight-binding Hamiltonian and compute $\mathcal{F}(t)$ from its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, a straightforward procedure that covers the segment of the $t$ axis in which the analytical expression is less accurate. The time dependence shows features of physical interest that have received little attention because they are inconspicuous in the frequency domain; the analytical expression provides a simple interpretation and traces them to an unusual form of interference. We then turn to eNRG, a recently proposed real-space variant that is more flexible than Wilson's NRG method, and present two complementary time-dependent algorithms. Comparison with the benchmarks shows that one of the eNRG algorithms yields virtually exact photocurrents with a small fraction of the computational effort to diagonalize the tight-binding Hamiltonian. The second algorithm is computationally less demanding and produces precise results at long times. In contemplation of extensions to correlated-impurity models, we identify sources of deviation and discuss the virtues and drawbacks of the two procedures.

Title: Diffuse-charge dynamics across a capacitive interface in a DC electric field
Authors: Shuozhen Zhao, Bhavya Balu, Zongxin Yu, Michael J. Miksis, Petia M. Vlahovska
Abstract: Cells and cellular organelles are encapsulated by nanometrically thin membranes whose main component is a lipid bilayer. In the presence of electric fields, the ion-impermeable lipid bilayer acts as a capacitor and supports a potential difference across the membrane. We analyze the charging dynamics of a planar membrane separating bulk solutions with different electrolyte concentrations upon the application of an applied uniform DC electric field. The membrane is modeled as a zero-thickness capacitive interface. The evolution of the electric potential and ions distributions in the bulk are solved for using the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations. Asymptotic solutions are derived in the limit of thin Debye layers and weak fields (compared to the thermal electric potential).

Title: Valency, charge-transfer, and orbital-dependent correlation in bilayer nickelates Nd3Ni2O7

Abstract: We examine the bulk electronic structure of Nd3Ni2O7 using Ni 2p core-level hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy combined with density functional theory + dynamical mean-field theory. Our results reveal a large deviation of the Ni 3d occupation from the formal Ni2.5+ valency, highlighting the importance of the charge-transfer from oxygen ligands. We find that the dominant d8 configuration is accompanied by nearly equal contributions from d7 and d9 states, exhibiting an unusual valence state among Ni-based oxides. Finally, we discuss the Ni dx2-y2 and dz2 orbital-dependent hybridization, correlation and local spin dynamics.

Title: Why is the strength of a polymer network so low?
Authors: Shaswat Mohanty, Jose Blanchet, Zhigang Suo, Wei Cai
Abstract: Experiments have long shown that a polymer network of covalent bonds commonly ruptures at a stress that is orders of magnitude lower than the strength of the covalent bonds. Here we investigate this large reduction in strength by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the network ruptures by sequentially breaking a small fraction of bonds, and that each broken bond lies on the minimum "shortest path". The shortest path is the path of the fewest bonds that connect two monomers at the opposite ends of the network. As the network is stretched, the minimum shortest path straightens and bears high tension set by covalent bonds, while most strands off the path deform by entropic elasticity. After a bond on the minimum shortest path breaks, the process repeats for the next minimum shortest path. As the network is stretched and bonds are broken, the scatter in lengths of the shortest paths first narrows, causing stress to rise, and then broadens, causing stress to decline. This sequential breaking of a small fraction of bonds causes the network to rupture at a stress that is orders of magnitude below the strength of the covalent bonds.

Title: Interaction-driven losses for atoms in a dark-state lattice
Authors: Piotr Kubala, Mateusz Łącki
Abstract: In this work we estimate the collisional loss rate of ultracold bosons in the optical potential featuring subwavelength-width peaks. This is established by using $\Lambda$ arrangement of three atomic states coupled (almost) resonantly by lasers. Using Fermi's Golden Rule, we find that the loss rate is influenced by the overall strength of the lasers, with the largest losses occurring when the two-photon transition is blue-detuned from the excited state of the $\Lambda$ system. Overall, the predicted loss rates are low, which may allow the use of ultracold bosons in the construction of dark-state potentials in the $\Lambda$-type many-level system.

Title: Revisiting the charge-density-wave superlattice of 1$T$-TiSe$_2$
Authors: Wei Wang, Patrick Liu, Lijun Wu, Jing Tao, Genda Gu, Alfred Zong, Yimei Zhu
Abstract: A number of intriguing phenomena, including exciton condensation, orbital ordering, and emergence of chirality, have been proposed to accompany charge-density-wave (CDW) formation in the layered transition metal dichalcogenide 1$T$-TiSe$_2$. Explaining these effects relies on knowledge of the atomic displacement pattern underlying the CDW, yet structural proposals based on spatially-averaging bulk crystal diffraction and surface-dependent scanning tunneling microscopy have remained inconsistent. Here, we revisit the CDW superlattice structure with selected-area electron diffraction, a bulk-sensitive probe capable of capturing sub-micrometer spatial variations while maintaining high momentum resolution. We resolved two distinct, spatially separated CDW phases characterized by different interlayer ordering. In both phases, previously reported atomic displacement patterns fail to account for the observed extinction rules. Instead, our analysis reveals a new superlattice structure, which features a large number of nearly degenerate CDW domains. These findings not only provide a new basis for understanding the gyrotropic electronic order and metastability in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$, they also underscore the importance of bulk-sensitive mesoscopic techniques in investigating materials that host unconventional superlattices.

Title: Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Classification for Constraint-Aware Alloy Design
Authors: Christofer Hardcastle, Ryan O Mullan, Raymundo Arroyave, Brent Vela
Abstract: Alloy design can be framed as a constraint-satisfaction problem. Building on previous methodologies, we propose equipping Gaussian Process Classifiers (GPCs) with physics-informed prior mean functions to model the boundaries of feasible design spaces. Through three case studies, we highlight the utility of informative priors for handling constraints on continuous and categorical properties. (1) Phase Stability: By incorporating CALPHAD predictions as priors for solid-solution phase stability, we enhance model validation using a publicly available XRD dataset. (2) Phase Stability Prediction Refinement: We demonstrate an in silico active learning approach to efficiently correct phase diagrams. (3) Continuous Property Thresholds: By embedding priors into continuous property models, we accelerate the discovery of alloys meeting specific property thresholds via active learning. In each case, integrating physics-based insights into the classification framework substantially improved model performance, demonstrating an efficient strategy for constraint-aware alloy design.

Title: When Homogeneous Systems Meet Dissipation and Disorder
Authors: Xixi Feng, Ao Zhou, Feng Lu, Gao Xianlong, Shujie Cheng
Abstract: We investigate the localization and topological properties of the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in a one-dimensional homogeneous system. Our results demonstrate that, despite the absence of disorder in the initial system, the NESS can exhibit localization under bond dissipation. Conversely, for an initially flat-band system with compactly localized wave functions, the NESS is delocalized. These dissipation-driven localization and delocalization phenomena are clearly distinguished using Wigner distributions. Furthermore, we find that the initial localization characteristics of the system significantly influence the localization properties of the NESS. Drawing upon the concept of Bose-Einstein condensate broadening in cold-atom experiments, along with experimental data, we systematically characterize the impact of disorder on the localization and topological properties of the NESS. The phase diagram reveals that the NESS can be topologically non-trivial even when the initial state is topologically trivial, and that the topological triviality of the initial state weakens the topological non-triviality of the NESS. This work provides new insights into the localization and topological phase transitions in homogeneous systems induced by bond dissipation and disorder.

Title: Photoinduced twist and untwist of moiré superlattices in TMDC heterobilayers

Abstract: Two-dimensional twisted bilayer moiré structures provide a versatile material platform for realizing a rich variety of strongly correlated electronic quantum phases intricately coupled with the periodically modulated lattice structures. In this work, we use ultrafast electron diffraction to directly reveal the photoinduced dynamic evolution of the moiré superlattice in $2^\circ$ and $57^\circ$ twisted WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterobilayers. Upon above-band-gap photoexcitation, the moiré superlattice diffraction features are enhanced within 1 ps and subsequently suppressed several picoseconds after, accompanied by a collective lattice excitation of a moiré phonon mode with sub-THz frequency. This unique response deviates markedly from typical photoinduced lattice heating, and suggests dynamic twisting and untwisting of the local moiré chiral structure. We infer large oscillations in the local twist angle, approaching $1^\circ$ peak to trough, that are driven by ultrafast charge carrier excitation and relaxation -- a phenomenon further supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings suggest a novel approach for real-time dynamic reconfiguration of moire superlattices to achieve ultrafast modulation of their strongly correlated behaviors.

Title: High Quality Single Crystal of Kitaev Spin Liquid Candidate Material RuBr3 Synthesized under High Pressure
Authors: Bowen Zhang, Xiangjun Li, Limin Yan, Wenbo Li, Nana Li, Jianfa Zhao, Xiaobing Liu, Shun-Li Yu, Zhiwei Hu, Wenge Yang, Runze Yu
Abstract: Kitaev quantum spin liquids have attracted significant attention in condensed matter physics over the past decade. To understand their emergent quantum phenomena, high-quality single crystals of substantial size are essential. Here, we report the synthesis of single crystals of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate RuBr3, achieving millimeter-sized crystals through a self-flux method under high pressure and high temperature conditions. The crystals exhibit well-defined cleavage planes with a lustrous appearance. Transport characterizations exhibit a narrow band-gap semiconducting behavior with 0.13 eV and 0.11 eV band-gap in ab plane and along c axis, respectively. Magnetic measurement shows a transition to antiferromagnetic (AFM) state at approximately 29 K both in ab plane and along c axis. Notably, the Néel temperature increases to 34 K with an applied magnetic field of up to 7 T in the ab plane, but without any change along c axis. The large size and high quality of RuBr3 single crystals provide a valuable platform for investigating various interactions, particularly the Kitaev interaction, and for elucidating the intrinsic physical properties of Kitaev quantum spin liquids.

Title: Application of Many-body Non-perturbative Theories to the Three-Dimensional Attractive Hubbard Model
Authors: Junnian Xiong, Hui Li, Yingze Su, Dingping Li
Abstract: The attractive Fermi-Hubbard model stands out as a simple model for studying the pairing and superconductivity of fermions on a lattice. In this article, we apply several many-body theories in the three-dimensional attractive Hubbard model. Specifically, we compare the results of various GW methods with DQMC simulations and observe that they provide reliable results in the weak to intermediate coupling regime. The critical exponents also agree well with the accurate results obtained from the 3D XY model. In the superconducting phase, the post-GW method significantly improves the description of Green's functions and density of states. Additionally, we propose a method to determine the temperature at which the pseudogap appears.

Title: Non-equilibrium distribution function in ultra-fast processes
Authors: K. S. Glavatskiy
Abstract: A simple expression for the non-equilibrium distribution function in ultra-fast transient processes is proposed. Postulating its dependence on temporal derivatives of the equilibrium integrals of motion, non-equilibrium analogues of the thermodynamic relationships are derived and the conditions that maximize the non-equilibrium entropy are identified. A rigorous threshold between ``slow" and ``fast" processes is suggested, identifying the range of applicability of classical quasi-equilibrium description. The proposed theory is validated by deriving the known law of inertial heat conduction, which accounts for finite speed of thermal propagation. Finally, a new expression for the non-equilibrium work is derived, revealing two kinds of pressure that emerge in fast non-equilibrium.

Title: Computational Study of Magnetic Behaviour in Ni-Adsorbed Nb2C-OF MXene using Density Functional Theory
Authors: Zarah Khan, Saleem Ayaz Khan, Ayesha Zaheer, Syed Rizwan
Abstract: Magnetic 2D materials have achieved significantly consideration owing to their encouraging applications. A variation of these 2D materials by occurrence of defects, by the transition-metal doping or adsorption or by the surface functionalization can initiate both the spin-polarization and magnetic properties in these materials. Density functional theory (DFT) is used to determine the electric, magnetic properties along with the electronic structures and stability of synthesized two-dimensional materials. This work describes the magnetic properties of Ni-ad-Nb2C-OF MXene. The study focuses on the computational approach based first principal calculation providing insight onto the magnetic properties of adsorbed compound and comparing it with pristine Nb2C-OF MXene. The pristine Nb2C-OF and Ni-ad-Nb2C-OF structures are simulated and optimized using Wien2k software. Using exchange-correlational functionals; spin-GGA and spin-GGA+U (for Nickel U= 6eV), Ni-ad-Nb2C-OF electronic band structure is found to be metallic having magnetic moment calculated +1.01516{\mu}_\b{eta} showing its non-superconducting and ferromagnetic behaviour. Owing to this magnetic nature, this 2D compound can be used for new upcoming applications such as spintronics and nano magnetic data storage devices.

Title: Competition Between Multiferroic and Magnetic Soliton Lattice States in DyFeO$_3$
Authors: S. E. Nikitin, N. D. Andriushin, Ø. S. Fjellvåg, E. Pomjakushina, A. A. Turrini, S. Artyukhin, C. W. Schneider, M. Mostovoy
Abstract: Simultaneous breaking of time reversal and inversion symmetries in multiferroics couples ferroelectricity to magnetism and is a source of unusual physical phenomena that can be used in next-generation electronic devices. A notable example is DyFeO$_3$, which under applied magnetic fields exhibits a giant linear magnetoelectric response and a large spontaneous electric polarization induced by coexisting orders of Fe and Dy spins. Here, we use high-resolution neutron diffraction to show that at zero field DyFeO$_3$ hosts an incommensurate magnetic soliton lattice formed by spatially ordered Dy domain walls with an average domain size of 231(8) Å. The long-ranged interaction between the domain walls is mediated by magnons propagating through the Fe subsystem and is analogous to the Yukawa force in particle physics. An applied magnetic field destroys the long-ranged incommensurate order, unlocks the linear magnetoelectric response and stabilizes the ferroelectric state. The magnetic domain walls are electrically charged and the soliton array dimerizes when both electric and magnetic fields are applied. Numerical simulations with experimental parameters suggest, that the generic competition between the ferroelectric and incommensurate states can be effectively controlled by an applied electric field.

Authors: D. P. Shinde
Abstract: We utilize large deviation theorems to analyze the distributions of a Bose gas of photons and Planck's identical linear oscillators. By applying the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems, we calculate the large deviation probabilities, entropies, and rate functions for the spatial and energy distributions of both photons and Planck's oscillators. Our study reproduces the results of Bose and Planck within the framework of large deviation theory.

Title: Weak coupling approach to magnetic and orbital susceptibilities for superconducting states in multiorbital electron-phonon coupled model
Authors: Natsuki Okada, Tatsuya Miki, Shintaro Hoshino
Abstract: Alkali-doped fullerides are molecular-based superconductors with multiple active orbitals. In this paper, using the Eliashberg theory with the retardation effect of Jahn-Teller phonons, we study the response of the spin-singlet superconducting state relevant to fulleride materials. The spin Zeeman field is not active for the singlet pairing state, and the magnetic orbital field, which physically generates a circular electron motion inside the fullerene molecule, is also shown to be inactive. On the other hand, the electric orbital (or quadrupolar) field, which corresponds to a uniaxial distortion, remains active across the superconducting phase transition. This is understood by the orbital-symmetric structure of the Cooper pair, which is susceptible to the electric orbital field, while it is not the case for the magnetic orbital field which tends to create an antisymmetric part.

Title: Effects of antiferromagnetic coupling and pinning on domain wall dynamics in synthetic ferrimagnets
Authors: Sougata Mallick, Nicolas Reyren, André Thiaville, Philippe Ohresser, Nicolas Jaouen, Vincent Cros, Vincent Jeudy
Abstract: Domain wall (DW) dynamics in antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems offer the advantages over their ferromagnetic counterparts of having faster and more energy efficient manipulation due to the absence of net magnetization, leading to reduced magnetic crosstalk and improved performance in spintronic devices. A comprehensive analysis of DW dynamics across regimes such as creep, depinning, and flow is well established in ferromagnetic systems but remains lacking in AFM-coupled systems. In this study, we explore the nature of DW dynamics in synthetic ferrimagnetic multilayers composed of Pt|Co|Tb|Al for different Tb thickness, focusing on the underlying pinning parameters, and on the different regimes of DW dynamics driven by spin-orbit torques (SOTs). We find that due to the AFM coupling between Co and Tb, the magnetic moment of Tb increases with Tb thickness resulting in a reduced saturation magnetization and an enhanced depinning field. The DW disorder interaction is found to vary weakly with the AFM coupling between Co and Tb, while the complete withdrawal of the Tb layer strongly increases the anisotropy and the DW pinning. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to measure effective SOTs by comparing depinning transitions in current and field-induced DW motion. This research reveals new insights into DW dynamics in coupled AFM systems, highlighting enhancements in mobility through optimized SOTs and pinning landscapes.

Title: High-Temperature Superconductivity from Finite-Range Attractive Interaction
Authors: Dmitry Miserev, Joel Hutchinson, Herbert Schoeller, Jelena Klinovaja, Daniel Loss
Abstract: In this letter we consider $D$-dimensional interacting Fermi liquids, and demonstrate that an attractive interaction with a finite range $R_s$ that is much greater than the Fermi wavelength $\lambda_F$ breaks the conventional BCS theory of superconductivity. In contrast to the BCS prediction of a finite superconducting gap for all attractive contact interactions, we show that a finite-range interaction does not induce a superconducting gap. Instead, the pair susceptibility develops a power-law singularity at zero momentum and zero frequency signaling quantum critical behavior without long-range ordering. Starting from this, we show that superconductivity can be stabilized by adding a short-range attractive interaction, which is always present in real electronic systems. As an example, we consider a layered quasi-two-dimensional material with attractive electron-electron interactions mediated by optical phonons. We demonstrate a dome shape of the critical temperature $T_c$ versus doping, strongly suppressed isotope effect, and a weak dependence of the optimal doping and maximal $T_c^* \sim 0.1 E_F$ on the interaction range at $R_s \gg \lambda_F$, $E_F$ is the Fermi energy. We believe that these results could be relevant to high-temperature superconductors.

Title: Simulation-based Super-Resolution EBSD for Measurements of Relative Deformation Gradient Tensors
Authors: Aimo Winkelmann, Grzegorz Cios, Konrad Perzyński, Tomasz Tokarski, Klaus Mehnert, Łukasz Madej, Piotr Bała
Abstract: We summarize a data analysis approach for electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) which uses high-resolution Kikuchi pattern simulations to measure isochoric relative deformation gradient tensors from experimentally measured Kikuchi patterns of relatively low resolution. Simulation-based supersampling of the theoretical test diffraction patterns enables a significant precision improvement of tensor parameters obtained in best-fit determinations of strains and orientations from low-resolution experimental patterns. As an application, we demonstrate high-resolution orientation and strain analysis for the model case of hardness test indents on a Si(100) wafer, using Kikuchi patterns of variable resolution. The approach shows noise levels near $1 \times 10^{-4}$ in the relative deviatoric strain norm and in the relative rotation angles on nominally strain-free regions of the silicon wafer. The strain and rotation measurements are interpreted by finite element simulations. While confirming the basic findings of previously published studies, the present approach enables a potential reduction in the necessary pattern data size by about two orders of magnitude. We estimate that pattern resolutions in the order of $256\times256$ pixels should be enough to solve a majority of EBSD analysis tasks using pattern matching techniques.

Title: Bose-Bose gases with nonuniversal corrections to the interactions: a droplet phase
Authors: Emerson Chiquillo
Abstract: Through an effective quantum field theory within Bogoliubov's framework and taking into account nonuniversal effects of the interatomic potential we analytically derive the leading Gaussian zero- and finite-temperature corrections to the equation of state of ultracold interacting Bose-Bose gases. We calculate the ground-state energy per particle at zero and low temperature for three- two- and one-dimensional two-component bosonic gases. By tuning the nonuniversal contribution to the interactions we address and establish conditions under which the formation and stability of a self-bound liquidlike phase or droplet with nonuniversal corrections to the interactions DNUC) is favorable. At zero temperature in three-dimensions and considering the nonuniversal corrections to the attractive interactions as a fitting parameter the energy per particle for DNUC is in good agreement with some diffusion Monte Carlo results. In two dimensions the DNUC present small deviations regarding conventional droplets. For the one-dimensional DNUC the handling of the nonuniversal effects to the interactions achieves a qualitative agreement with the trend of some available Monte Carlo data in usual droplets. We also introduce some improved Gross-Pitaevskii equations to describe self-trapped DNUC in three, two and one dimension. We briefly discuss some aspects at low temperature regarding nonuniversal corrections to the interactions in Bose-Bose gases. We derive the dependencies on the nonuniversal contribution to the interactions but also on the difference between intra- and inter-species coupling constants. This last dependence crucially affect the three- and the two-dimensional DNUC driving thus to a thermal-induced instability. This thermal instability is also present in one-dimensional Bose-Bose gases, but it is not relevant on the formation of DNUC...

Title: Enhanced Gilbert Damping via Cubic Spin-Orbit Coupling at 2DHG/Ferromagnetic Insulator Interface
Authors: Sushmita Saha, Alestin Mawrie
Abstract: We investigate the enhancement of Gilbert damping at 2DHG/ferromagnetic insulator (FI) interfaces, where spin pumping from the FI layer injects spins into the 2DHG, and cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) significantly boosts spin relaxation and spin-pumping efficiency compared to 2DEG systems. The dominant contribution to spin damping arises from interband transitions which does exhibits conductivity-like behavior as the temperature, \( T \to 0 \). Our results reveal that damping remains stronger than in 2DEG due to the persistent influence of cubic RSOC. The interplay between RSOC and magnon absorption broadens the spectral response, with the damping peak shifting more notably at higher temperatures. Stronger RSOC expands the magnon interaction phase space, thus widening the damping spectrum. A key observation emerges with the Fermi level (\(E_f\)): a finite \(E_f\) sustains spin imbalance and enhances damping, whereas \(E_f = 0\) suppresses it, unlike in 2DEG. The electric field tunability of RSOC enables real-time control over spin relaxation and angular momentum transfer, offering a pathway toward voltage-controlled spintronic devices. These findings highlight the superior potential of 2DHG for tailoring spin dynamics via electric and thermal effects.

Title: Phase-change materials for volatile threshold resistive switching and neuronal device applications
Authors: Huandong Chen, Jayakanth Ravichandran
Abstract: Volatile threshold resistive switching and neuronal oscillations in phase-change materials, specifically those undergoing metal-to-insulator and charge density wave transitions, offer unique attributes such as fast and low-field volatile switching, tunability, and non-linear behaviors. These characteristics are particularly promising for emulating neuronal behavior and thus hold great potential for realizing energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of neuronal oscillator devices based on three archetypal electronic phase-change materials: the correlated oxide VO2, the charge density wave transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2, and the emerging phase-change chalcogenide perovskite BaTiS3. We discuss progress from the perspective of materials development, including structural phase transitions, synthesis methods, electrical properties, and device implementation. Finally, we emphasize the major challenges that must be addressed for practical applications of these phase-change materials and provide our outlook on the future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

Title: Observation of the Dirac Dispersions in Co-doped CaFe2As2
Authors: Marcin Rosmus, Natalia Olszowska, Rafal Kurleto, Zbigniew Bukowski, Pawel Starowicz
Abstract: We performed an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study of the electronic structure of the CaFe2As2 122-iron pnictide, a parent compound, and two iron-based superconductors CaFe(2-x)CoxAs2 (x = 0.07 and 0.15). We studied the band structure of this system across the phase diagram with the transition from the orthorhombic spin density wave (SDW) phase to the tetragonal paramagnetic phase. We observed characteristic features of the electronic structures corresponding to the antiferromagnetic phase in the parent compound and the samples with low cobalt concentration (x = 0.07). For highly doped systems (x = 0.15), the measurements revealed the concentric branches of the Fermi surface, which are associated with paramagnetic and superconducting 122-iron pnictides. We found the existence of Dirac cones located at 30 meV below Fermi energy for nonsuperconducting CaFe2As2 and superconducting CaFe(1.93)Co(0.07)As2 orthorhombic SDW systems.

Title: Anatomy of anomalous Hall effect due to magnetic fluctuations
Authors: Ola Kenji Forslund, Xiaoxiong Liu, Soohyeon Shin, Chun Lin, Masafumi Horio, Qisi Wang, Kevin Kramer, Saumya Mukherjee, Timur Kim, Cephise Cacho, Chennan Wang, Tian Shang, Victor Ukleev, Jonathan S. White, Pascal Puphal, Yasmine Sassa, Ekaterina Pomjakushina, Titus Neupert, Johan Chang
Abstract: The anomalous Hall {\color{black} e}ffect (AHE) has emerged as a key indicator of time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) and topological features in electronic band structures. Absent of a magnetic field, the AHE requires spontaneous TRSB but has proven hard to probe due to averaging over domains. The anomalous component of the Hall effect is thus frequently derived from extrapolating the magnetic field dependence of the Hall response. We show that discerning whether the AHE is an intrinsic property of the field free system becomes intricate in the presence of strong magnetic fluctuations. {\color{black}As a study case,} we use the Weyl semimetal PrAlGe, where TRSB can be toggled via a ferromagnetic transition, providing a transparent view of the AHE's topological origin. Through a combination of thermodynamic, transport and muon spin relaxation measurements, we contrast the behaviour below the ferromagnetic transition temperature to that of strong magnetic fluctuations above. Our results {\color{black}on PrAlGe provide general insights into the} interpretation of anomalous Hall signals in systems where TRSB is debated, such as families of Kagome metals or certain transition metal dichalcogenides.

Title: Superconducting and spin-density wave phases probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy in the organic conductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$
Authors: Mohammadmehdi Torkzadeh, Pascale Senzier, Claude Bourbonnais, Abdelouahab Sedeki, Cécile Méziere, Marie Hervé, Francois Debontridder, Pascal David, Tristan Cren, Claire Marrache-Kikuchi, Denis Jerome, Christophe Brun
Abstract: By scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we have probed the local quasi-particle density of states (DOS) of the Bechgaard salt organic superconductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$ in slowly cooled single crystals cleaved under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. In well STM imaged crystallographic surface planes, the local DOS has been probed for different surface areas at temperatures above and below the critical temperature of superconducting or insulating spin-density wave states. While a rather homogeneous superconducting state is expected in the bulk from previous studies, depending on the degree of disorder introduced by cleavage in the anion lattice, an inhomogeneous granular state is predominantly observed at the surface. A pronounced linear V-shape profile of the local DOS is observed from intermediate to the lowest energy scale in the less disordered superconducting surface areas. This supports the existence of an unconventional d-wave like order parameter with nodes at low energy, which is preceded by more energetic fluctuations attributed to quantum criticality of the material. At higher energy disorder combined to correlations deplete further the DOS. By contrast a non-linear U-shape characterizes the local low energy DOS profile for the more disordered and insulating surface areas of the spin-density wave state. The experimental results are compared quantitatively with those predicted by the renormalization group theory of the quasi-one dimensional electron gas model and its description of the superconducting and spin-density wave states that are interlinked by quantum criticality in the Bechgaard salts.

Title: Superconducting Diode Effects: Mechanisms, Materials and Applications
Authors: Jiajun Ma, Ruiya Zhan, Xiao Lin
Abstract: Superconducting diode effects (SDEs) generally emerge in superconducting systems where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken, showing nonreciprocal current characteristics: nondissipative in one direction and ohmic in the opposite. Since the discovery of the SDEs by Ando et al. in the noncentrosymmetric superconductor [Nb/V/Ta]n in 2020, notable progress has been achieved on both the theoretical and experimental fronts. It has been proposed that intrinsic SDEs are closely linked to various exotic superconducting states, such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, topological superconductivity, and chiral superconductivity. Recently, SDEs have emerged as important experimental tools for detecting symmetry breaking in exotic superconducting states. This advancement not only enhances our understanding of the fundamental nature of SDEs but also opens new possibilities for their applications in superconducting physics and related fields. This review focuses on the recent experimental progress in the observation of the SDEs and discusses their primary mechanisms from the perspective of material properties and symmetry breaking. Finally, we summarize the observed rectification efficiency of SDE devices and discuss future research directions in this rapidly developing field.

Title: Rheological response of soft Solid/Liquid Composites
Authors: Elina Gilbert, Christophe Poulard, Anniina Salonen
Abstract: Understanding a material's dissipative response is important for their use in many applications, such as adhesion. In dispersions the interplay between matrix and inclusions complicates any description. Fractional rheology is conveniently used to fit the storage and loss moduli of complex materials, although the physical picture is often elusive. We study the rheology of soft solid/liquid composites of liquid poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) droplets in a soft poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix. We analyze the influence of the droplets through fractional rheology and a time-concentration superposition. Viscous dissipation increases proportionally with volume fraction, and we show that a simple, well-fitting model can induce misinterpretation of the physics in a complex material.

Title: New insights into crystallographic relation and lattice dynamics effects in {CdO/MgO} superlattices grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy
Authors: Aleksandra Wierzbicka, Ewa Przezdziecka, Igor Perlikowski, Eunika Zielony, Abinash Adhikari, Anastasiia Lysak
Abstract: This article explores the structural properties of molecular beam epitaxy grown {CdO/MgO} superlattices on sapphire substrates of different crystallographic orientations (a-, c-, r-, and m-plane). The investigations involve a comprehensive analysis using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. High-resolution X-ray diffraction studies unveil a significant influence of surface symmetry on both the substrates and the epitaxial layers, particularly with respect to the occurrence of twins in the superlattices. Remarkably, no twins are observed on r-oriented sapphire substrates, resulting in improved interface and crystallographic quality. The results of studies demonstrated in this work show that the growth rate of CdO sublayers within {CdO/MgO} superlattices is intricately dependent on the substrate orientation. Notably, the c-plane and m-plane sapphire substrates yielded thicker CdO sublayers, indicating comparable growth rates for these crystallographic orientations. Conversely, the a-plane and r-plane orientations seemed to favor a slower growth rate of CdO sublayers.

Title: Structural and Electronic Properties of Ta2O5 with One Formula Unit
Authors: Yangwu Tong, Huimin Tang, Yong Yang
Abstract: Based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify a stable triclinic crystal structure of Ta2O5 (named as {\gamma}1-Ta2O5) at atmospheric pressure whose unit cell contains one formula unit (Z=1). Comparison with the Z=1 Ta2O5 structures from the Materials Project [APL Mater. 1, 011002 (2013)] reveals that {\gamma}1-Ta2O5 is energetically the most stable among the Z=1 Ta2O5 phases, and is the second most stable among all the Ta2O5 phases. Characterization of {\gamma}1-Ta2O5 is carried out by analyzing the X-ray powder diffraction patterns, the elastic, vibrational, thermal and electronic properties. The electronic structures of {\gamma}1-Ta2O5 are calculated using standard DFT as well as many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation. The results indicate that {\gamma}1-Ta2O5 is a wide band gap semiconductor with an indirect gap of ~ 3.361 eV.

Title: Layer-Resolved Quantum Transport in Twisted Bilayer Graphene: Counterflow and Machine Learning Predictions
Authors: Matheus H. Gobbo Khun, L. A. Silva, D. A. Bahamon
Abstract: The layer-resolved quantum transport response of a twisted bilayer graphene device is investigated by driving a current through the bottom layer and measuring the induced voltage in the top layer. Devices with four- and eight-layer differentiated contacts were analyzed, revealing that in a nanoribbon geometry (four contacts), a counterflow current emerges in the top layer, while in a square-junction configuration (eight contacts), this counterflow is accompanied by a transverse, or Hall, component. These effects persist despite weak coupling to contacts, onsite disorder, and variations in device size. The observed counterflow response indicates a circulating interlayer current, which generates an in-plane magnetic moment excited by the injected current. Finally, due to the intricate relationship between the electrical layer response, energy, and twist angle, a clusterized machine learning model was trained, validated, and tested to predict various conductances.

Title: A square skyrmion lattice in multi-orbital $f$-electron systems
Authors: Yan Zha, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: We report the emergence of a square-shaped skyrmion lattice in multi-orbital $f$-electron systems with easy-axis magnetic anisotropy on a centrosymmetric square lattice. By performing mean-field calculations for an effective localized model consisting of two Kramers doublets, we construct the low-temperature phase diagram in a static external magnetic field. Consequently, we find that a square-shaped skyrmion lattice with the skyrmion number of one appears in the intermediate-field region when the crystal field splitting between the two doublets is small. Furthermore, we identify another double-$Q$ state with a nonzero net scalar chirality at zero- and low-field regions, which is attributed to the help of the multi-orbital degree of freedom. Our results offer another route to search for skyrmion-hosting materials in centrosymmetric $f$-electron tetragonal systems with multi-orbital degrees of freedom, e.g., Ce-based compounds. This contrasts with conventional other $f$-electron systems hosting skyrmion lattices, such as Gd- and Eu-based compounds without orbital angular momentum.

Title: Quantum Tunneling Enhanced Hydrogen Desorption from Graphene Surface: Atomic versus Molecular Mechanism
Authors: Yangwu Tong, Yong Yang
Abstract: We study the desorption mechanism of hydrogen isotopes from graphene surface using first-principles calculations, with focus on the effects of quantum tunneling. At low temperatures, quantum tunneling plays a dominant role in the desorption process of both hydrogen monomers and dimers. In the case of dimer desorption, two types of mechanisms, namely the traditional one-step desorption in the form of molecules (molecular mechanism), and the two-step desorption in the form of individual atoms (atomic mechanism) are studied and compared. For the ortho-dimers, the dominant desorption mechanism is found to switch from the molecular mechanism to the atomic mechanism above a critical temperature, which is respectively ~ 300 K and 200 K for H and D.

Title: Surface magnetoelectric driven spin dynamics in metallic antiferromagnets
Authors: R.M. Dubrovin, A.V. Kimel, A.K. Zvezdin
Abstract: Although magnetoelectric effects in metals are usually neglected, assuming that applied electric fields are screened by free charge carriers, the skin depth, defining the penetration depth of the fields, is non-zero and for THz electric fields typically reaches 400 nm. Hence, if the thickness of an antiferromagnetic film is of the order of tens of nm, electric field induced effects cannot be neglected. Here, we theoretically study the THz electric field induced spin dynamics in the metallic antiferromagnets $\mathrm{Mn}_{2}\mathrm{Au}$ and $\mathrm{CuMnAs}$, whose spin arrangements allow them to exhibit a linear magnetoelectric effect. We shown that the THz magnetoelectric torque in metallic antiferromagnets is proportional to the time derivative of the THz electric field induced polarization. Our simulations reveal that the magnetoelectric driven spin dynamics is indeed not negligible and can fairly explain the previously published experimental results on antiferromagnetic dynamics excited by the THz pump pulses in $\mathrm{Mn}_{2}\mathrm{Au}$ at the corresponding magnetoelectric susceptibility value $\alpha_{\mathrm{ME}} \simeq 2 \times 10^{-5}$ without involving other mechanisms. This value is about one order of magnitude smaller than that known for collinear and rare-earth-free antiferromagnets such as $\mathrm{Cr}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$. For such a value of magnetoelectric response, it appears that the THz electric fields of realistic strengths of about 1 MV/cm are sufficient in order to achieve spin dynamics with the amplitudes sufficiently strong enough for switching of the antiferromagnetic Néel vector between the stable ground states. Thus, we contend that the experimental studies of the coherent dynamics of the antiferromagnetic Néel vector driven by the THz pulses in magnetoelectric metal films necessitate a careful consideration of the linear magnetoelectric effect.

Title: Finite-time blowup of a Brownian particle in a repulsive potential
Authors: P. L. Krapivsky, Baruch Meerson
Abstract: We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blowup time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.

Title: Exploring Novel 2D Analogues of Goldene: Electronic, Mechanical, and Optical Properties of Silverene and Copperene
Authors: Emanuel J. A. dos Santos, Rodrigo A. F. Alves, Alexandre C. Dias, Marcelo L. Pereira Junior, Douglas S. Galvão, Luiz A. Ribeiro Junior
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and broad application potential. Building on the success of goldene, a monolayer lattice of gold atoms, we explore its proposed silver and copper analogs, silverene and copperene, using density functional theory calculations. Our findings reveal that silverene and copperene are energetically stable, with formation energies of -2.3 eV/atom and -3.1 eV/atom, closely matching goldene's -2.9 eV/atom. Phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm their structural and dynamical stability at room temperature, showing no bond breaking or structural reconfiguration. Mechanical analyses indicate isotropy, with Young's moduli of 73 N/m, 44 N/m, and 59 N/m for goldene, silverene, and copperene, respectively, alongside Poisson's ratios of 0.46, 0.42, and 0.41. These results suggest comparable rigidity and deformation characteristics. Electronic band structure analysis highlights their metallic nature, with variations in the band profiles at negative energy levels. Despite their metallic character, these materials exhibit optical properties akin to semiconductors, pointing to potential applications in optoelectronics.

Title: Exerting chemical pressure on the kagome lattice as frustration control in the kapellasite family $A$Cu$_3$(OH)$_{6+x}$(Cl,Br)$_{3-x}$
Authors: Jonas Andreas Krieger, Thomas James Hicken, Hubertus Luetkens, Reinhard K. Kremer, Pascal Puphal
Abstract: The kapellasite family $A$Cu$_3$(OH)$_{6+x}$(Cl,Br)$_{3-x}$ forms a series of compounds, wherein the chemical pressure realized by the $A-$site cation tunes the spin exchange in the frustrated distorted kagome lattice. Via hydrothermal synthesis we have grown single crystals of the whole series for $A=$ rare-earths and found a clear structural transition to a superstructure variant at a specific chemical pressure level exerted by $A$~=~Dy. Phases with crystal structures in the vicinity of this superstructure transition realize a distorted kagome lattice of the Cu$^{2+}$ cations with characteristic features of a spin liquid. Here, subtle structural disorder as well as controlled chemical pressure can stabilize the spin liquid phase. We study the crystal structure and the magnetic ground state of these phases via single crystal x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and muon spin spectroscopy measurements.

Title: Evolution of radiation-induced damage in nuclear graphite - a comparative structural and microstructural study
Authors: Magdalena Wilczopolska, Kinga Suchorab, Magdalena Gaweda, Malgorzata Frelek-Kozak, Pawel Ciepielewski, Marcin Brykala, Wojciech Chmurzynski, Iwona Jozwik
Abstract: Graphite, as a material for high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGR), will be exposed to harsh environment. The stability of graphite structure under irradiation is of a key importance for efficiency, reliability and security of the Generation IV nuclear reactors. Three types of nuclear grade graphite were subjected to irradiation in this research - two commercially manufactured (IG-110 and NBG-17) and the laboratory's in-home material (NCBJ). The samples were exposed to 150 keV Ar+ and He+ ions bombardment at 400 C with fluences ranging from 1E12 to 2E17 ion/cm2 in order to simulate in-reactor conditions. For analysis of the level of structure damage, type of created defects and crystallite size changes under ion irradiation ex-situ Raman spectroscopy was used. The methodology of spectra fitting was developed. Furthermore, SEM observation of irradiated materials was performed. Results showed structural degradation of materials by the means of amorphisation: slight at a low fluence level, rising rapidly at higher irradiation values. Furthermore, stronger structural disorder was found in the materials irradiated with heavier Ar+ ions than with lighter He+. Microstructural evolution of the nuclear graphites aligned with the structural deterioration in its stepwise character.

Title: Diffusive spin transport of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain in the Ising regime at zero magnetic field and finite temperature
Authors: Jose M. P. Carmelo, Pedro D. Sacramento
Abstract: The studies of this paper on the spin-1/2 XXZ chain at finite temperatures T>0 have two complementary goals. The first is to identify the spin carriers of all its Sq>0 energy eigenstates and to show that their spin elementary currents fully control the spin-transport quantities. Here Sq is the q-spin of the continuous SUq(2) symmetry of the model for anisotropy >1. To achieve this goal, our studies rely on a suitable exact physical-spin this http URL the spin stiffness and the zero-field spin-diffusion constant are expressed in terms of thermal expectation values of the square of the elementary currents carried by the spin carriers. Our second goal is to confirm that the zero-field and finite-temperature spin transport is normal diffusive for anisotropy >1. We use two complementary methods that rely on an inequality for the T>0 spin stiffness and the above thermal expectation values, respectively, to show that the contributions to ballistic spin transport vanish. Complementarily, for T>0 and anisotropy >1, the spin-diffusion constant is found to be finite and enhanced upon lowering T, reaching its largest yet finite values at low temperatures. Evidence suggests that it diverges in the anisotropy limit to 1 for T>0, consistent with T>0 anomalous superdiffusive spin transport at anisotropy 1 and zero field.

Title: When Adiabaticity Is Not Enough to Study Topological Phases in Solid-State Physics: Comparing the Berry and Aharonov-Anandan Phases in 2D Materials
Authors: Abdiel de Jesús Espinosa-Champo, Alejandro Kunold, Gerardo G. Naumis
Abstract: Topological phases arise as the parameters of a quantum system are varied as a function of time. Under the adiabatic approximation, the time dependency can be removed and the Berry topological phase can be obtained from a trajectory on the parameter space. Although this approach is usually applied in solid-state physics without further reflection, in many cases, say in Dirac or Weyl materials, the adiabatic approximation is never met as many systems are gapless. Here it is shown how to use other time dependent defined topological quantities, in particular the Aharonov-Anandan phase that provides information not only about the topology but also about band transitions. Therefore, we analyze the problem of graphene under electromagnetic radiation from a time-driven perspective, demonstrating how the Aharonov-Anandan and Berry phases provide complementary information about the topology and interband transitions. This is achieved using the Dirac-Bloch formalism and by solving the time-dependent equations within Floquet theory.

Title: Magnetization symmetry for the MnTe altermagnetic candidate
Authors: N.N. Orlova, V.D. Esin, A.V. Timonina, N.N. Kolesnikov, E.V. Deviatov
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the magnetization angle dependence $M(\alpha)$ for single crystals of MnTe altermagnetic candidate. In high magnetic fields, experimental $M(\alpha)$ curves nearly independent of temperature, they mostly reflect standard antiferromagnetic spin-flop processes below the Néel vector reorientation field. In contrast, $M(\alpha)$ dependences are quite unusual at low temperatures and in low magnetic fields: below 81~K, spontaneous magnetization appears as a sharp $M(T)$ magnetization jump, the easy axis direction is equally $\pi/2$ rotated either by increasing the field above 1~kOe or the temperature above 81~K. We provide experimental arguments that the spontaneous magnetization of MnTe below 81~K differs strongly from the well known weak ferromagnetism of conventional antiferromagnetics, thus, it requires to take into account formation of the altermagnetic ground state. Despite the MnTe altermagnetic state is expected to be g-wave, i.e. $\pi/3$ periodic one, our experiment confirms the prevailing population of one from three easy axes, as it has been shown previously by temperature-dependent angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy.

Title: AI-guided transition path sampling of lipid flip-flop and membrane nanoporation
Authors: Matthias Post, Gerhard Hummer
Abstract: We study lipid translocation ("flip-flop") between the leaflets of a planar lipid bilayer with transition path sampling (TPS). Rare flip-flops compete with biological machineries that actively establish asymmetric lipid compositions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) guided TPS captures flip-flop without biasing the dynamics by initializing molecular dynamics simulations close to the tipping point, i.e., where it is equally likely for a lipid to next go to one or the other leaflet. We train a neural network model on the fly to predict the respective probability, i.e., the "committor" encoding the mechanism of flip-flop. Whereas coarse-grained DMPC lipids "tunnel" through the hydrophobic bilayer, unaided by water, atomistic DMPC lipids instead utilize spontaneously formed water nanopores to traverse to the other side. For longer DSPC lipids, these membrane defects are less stable, with lipid transfer along transient water threads in a locally thinned membrane emerging as a third distinct mechanism. Remarkably, in the high (~660) dimensional feature space of the deep neural networks, the reaction coordinate becomes effectively linear, in line with Cover's theorem and consistent with the idea of dominant reaction tubes.

Title: Uncovering the atomic structure of substitutional platinum dopants in MoS$_2$ with single-sideband ptychography
Authors: David Lamprecht, Anna Benzer, Manuel Längle, Mate Capin, Clemens Mangler, Toma Susi, Lado Filipovic, Jani Kotakoski
Abstract: We substitute individual Pt atoms into monolayer MoS$_2$ and study the resulting atomic structures with single-sideband (SSB) ptychography supported by ab initio simulations. We demonstrate that while high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging provides excellent Z-contrast, distinguishing some defect types such as single and double sulfur vacancies remains challenging due to their low relative contrast difference. However, SSB with its nearly linear Z-contrast and high phase sensitivity enables reliable identification of these defect configurations as well as various Pt dopant structures at significantly lower electron doses. Our findings uncover the precise atomic placement and highlight the potential of SSB ptychography for detailed structural analysis of dopant-modified 2D materials while minimizing beam-induced damage, offering new pathways for understanding and engineering atomic-scale features in 2D systems.

Title: Effective field theory and thermal Hall effect of magnons in square-lattice antiferromagnets
Authors: Masataka Kawano
Abstract: Thermal Hall transport has emerged as a powerful probe of neutral quasiparticles and associated gauge fields in insulating materials. Although the emergence of a thermal Hall effect is known to be sensitive to lattice geometry and gauge structures, an intuitive understanding of the conditions for its emergence remains limited, especially for edge-shared lattice geometries such as square and triangular lattices. Here, we develop an effective field theory of magnons in square-lattice antiferromagnets to establish the intuitive picture that elucidates the conditions for a finite thermal Hall response. By constructing an effective field theory from a spin model on the square lattice, we show that its low-energy excitations can be described by magnons with an effective SU(2) gauge field and Zeeman field that couple to magnon's pseudospins, which reflect the two-sublattice degrees of freedom in the antiferromagnets. The field strength associated with the SU(2) gauge field acts as a pseudospin-dependent magnetic field, bending the magnon's trajectories in opposite directions depending on their pseudospin. In addition, the effective Zeeman field induces an imbalance between pseudospin up and down magnons, and the combination of these two fields gives rise to the thermal Hall effect of magnons. This intuitive picture provides a systematic classification of magnetic orders in square-lattice antiferromagnets based on the presence or absence of the thermal Hall effect. We expect that our framework can be extended to various other spin models.

Title: Asymmetric simple exclusion process on a random comb: Transport properties in the stationary state
Authors: Mrinal Sarkar, Shamik Gupta
Abstract: We address the dynamics of interacting particles on a disordered lattice formed by a random comb. The dynamics comprises that of the asymmetric simple exclusion process, whereby motion to nearest-neighour sites that are empty are more likely in the direction of a bias than in the opposite direction. The random comb comprises a backbone lattice from each site of which emanates a branch with a random number of sites. The backbone and the branches run in the direction of the bias. The number of branch sites or alternatively the branch lengths are sampled independently from a common distribution, specifically, an exponential distribution. The system relaxes at long times into a nonequilibrium stationary state. We analyse the stationary-state density of sites across the random comb by employing a mean-field approximation. Further, we explore the transport properties, in particular, the stationary-state drift velocity of particles along the backbone. We show that in the stationary state, the density is uniform along the backbone and nonuniform along the branches, decreasing monotonically from the free-end of a branch to its intersection with the backbone. On the other hand, the drift velocity as a function of the bias strength has a non-monotonic dependence, first increasing and then decreasing with increase of bias. However, remarkably, as the particle density increases, the dependence becomes no more non-monotonic. We understand this effect as a consequence of an interplay between biased hopping and hard-core exclusion, whereby sites towards the free end of the branches remain occupied for long times and become effectively non-participatory in the dynamics of the system. This results in an effective reduction of the branch lengths and a motion of the particles that takes place primarily along the backbone.

Title: Single-Molecule Water Motion on h-BN and Graphene: A Paradigm Shift in Understanding the Behaviour of Water on 2D Material Interfaces
Authors: Philipp Seiler, Anthony Payne, Neubi F. Xavier Jr, Louie Slocombe, Marco Sacchi, Anton Tamtögl
Abstract: Understanding water behaviour on 2D materials is crucial for sensing, microfluidics, and tribology. While water/graphene interactions are well studied, water on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) remains largely unexplored. Despite structural similarity to graphene, h-BN's slightly polar B-N bonds impart a large band gap, high thermal conductivity, and chemical stability, making it promising for electronics, lubricants, and coatings. Moreover, existing water studies often focus on multilayer water dynamics, overlooking single-molecular details. We bridge this gap by studying single-molecular water friction and diffusion on h-BN, comparing it with graphene using helium spin-echo experiments and ab initio calculations. Our findings show that water diffusion on h-BN/Ni follows a complex rotational-translational dynamic, unlike graphene. While conventional views treat water motion as discrete jumps between equivalent adsorption sites, we demonstrate that on h-BN, water molecules rotate freely around their centre of mass. Although the binding energies of water on h-BN and graphene are similar, the activation energy for water dynamics on h-BN is 2.5 times lower than on graphene, implying a much lower barrier for molecular mobility. The fundamentally different diffusion characteristics which classical models cannot capture, underscores the need to rethink how we model water on polar 2D materials. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the metal substrate strongly influences water friction, with h-BN/Ni showing a markedly lower friction than graphene/Ni, in stark contrast to the free-standing materials. These findings challenge assumptions about 2D material-water interactions, highlighting the crucial role of substrate effects in chemistry and material science and offer insights for designing next-generation microfluidic devices that require precise water mobility control.

Title: Effective medium theory for the electrical conductivity of random metallic nanowire networks
Authors: Yuri Yu. Tarasevich, Irina V. Vodolazskaya, Andrei V. Eserkepov
Abstract: Interest in studying the conductive properties of networks made from randomly distributed nanowires is due to their numerous technological applications. Although the sheet resistance of such networks can be calculated directly, the calculations require many characteristics of the system (distributions of lengths, diameters and resistances of nanowires, distribution of junction resistance), the measurement of which is difficult. Furthermore, such calculations can hardly offer an analytical dependence of the sheet resistance on the basic physical parameters of the systems under consideration. Although various theoretical approaches offer such analytical dependencies, they are often based on more or less reasonable assumptions rather than rigorously proven statements. Here, we offer an approach based on Foster's theorem to reveal a dependence of the sheet resistance of dense nanowire networks on the main parameters of such networks. This theorem offers an additional perspective on the effective medium theory and extends our insight.

Title: Weyl and Dirac Semimetals for Thermoelectric Applications
Authors: Saurabh Singh, Sarmistha Das, Shiv Kumar
Abstract: Weyl and Dirac semimetals, characterized by their unique band structures with linear energy dispersion (E vs k) near the Fermi level (EF), have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation technology based on thermoelectric materials. Their exceptional electronic properties, notably high carrier mobility and substantial Berry curvature, offer the potential to surmount the limitations inherent in conventional thermoelectric materials. A comprehensive understanding of the fundamental physics underlying these materials is essential. This chapter mainly focused into the topological properties and distinctive electronic band structures of Weyl and Dirac semimetals, providing a theoretical framework for comprehending their thermoelectric transport properties such as Seebeck coefficients, electrical and thermal conductivity. The pivotal role of Berry curvature in enhancing Seebeck coefficients while reducing thermal conductivity is a key focus. Experimental advancements in synthesizing single crystals and characterizing these materials have been significant. Recent development in material growth and characterization techniques have propelled research forward. The intricate relationship between material properties, such as carrier concentration, electronic bandgap, and crystal structure, and thermoelectric performance is explored. Realizing the potential of Weyl and Dirac semimetals for practical thermoelectric applications necessitates overcoming specific challenges. This chapter outlines strategies to optimize thermoelectric figures of merit (ZT) through band engineering, carrier doping, and nanostructuring. Moreover, the exploration of hybrid materials and heterostructures offers promising avenues for enhancing thermoelectric performance for renewable energy applications.

Title: Floquet topological state induced by light-driven band inversion in SnTe
Authors: F.Chassot, G. Kremer, A. Pulkkinen, C. Wang, J. Krempasky, J. Minar, G. Springholz, M. Puppin, J.H. Dil, C. Monney
Abstract: High intensity coherent light can dress matter, realizing new hybrid phases that are not accessible in equilibrium. This effect results from the coherent interaction between Bloch states inside the solid and the periodic field of impinging photons which produces hybrid light-matter states called Floquet-Bloch states that can alter properties of the solid. Optically inducing a topological state in a semiconductor using so-called Floquet engineering is an exciting prospect. However, it has not been realized, despite its theoretical prediction more than 10 years ago. Here we show that an ultrashort-lived topological state that is absent at equilibrium in the ground state of SnTe can be created with femtosecond light pulses. This occurs when the photoexcitation is similar in energy with the band gap of this polar semiconductor. We observe a concomitant renormalization of the band dispersions that reveals the generation of Floquet states connecting to the topological state. We therefore provide the first direct experimental observation of a Floquet topological state and propose that it is driven by a light-induced band inversion in SnTe. Our discovery opens the way for controlling optically on-demand the topological properties of semiconductors.

Title: Identification of Polytypism and Their Dislocations in Bilayer MoS2 Using Correlative Transmission Electron Microscopy and Raman Spectroscopy
Authors: Xin Zhou, Tobias Dierke, Mingjian Wu, Shengbo You, Klaus Götz, Tobias Unruh, Philipp Pelz, Johannes Will, Janina Maultzsch, Erdmann Spiecker
Abstract: Stacking orders and topological defects substantially influence the physical properties of 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials. However, the inherent features of 2D materials challenge the effectiveness of single characterization techniques in identifying stacking sequences, necessitating correlative approaches. Using bilayer MoS2 as a benchmark, we differentiate its polytypism and specific dislocations through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. Perfect and partial dislocations were revealed in TEM, which are closely linked to the stacking sequences, thus indirectly indicating the 2H and 3R polytypes. 3D electron diffraction reconstruction on relrods and low-frequency Raman spectroscopy further validated these polytypes owing to their reliance on crystal symmetry. Surprisingly, we unexpectedly resolved both polytypes despite starting with 2H bulk crystal, pointing to a possible phase transition during mechanical exfoliation. The correlative TEM-Raman approach can be extended to other 2D materials, paving the way for property alteration via stacking and defect engineering.

Title: Enhanced magnetoelastic stress in disordered iron-gallium alloy thin films revealed by direct measurement
Authors: Adrián Begué, Maria Grazia Proietti, José Ignacio Arnaudas, Miguel Ciria
Abstract: The large magnetostriction in FeGa alloys is relevant for manifold applications, but for thin films, it can play a prominent role in controlling the strength of the magnetic anisotropy. Bulk samples show values depending on the extensive preparation procedure compendium, which is limited in its temperature range for high-quality thin-film synthesis. Here, we present a study of the magnetoelastic coupling coefficients $B_1$ and $B_2$ in epitaxial FeGa thin films below 50 nm deposited on the MgO(001) surface at 150 $^\circ$C by the cantilever method. Series of films with 22, 28, and 33 at. % Ga do not show thickness-dependent variations for $B_1$ and $B_2$, but $-B_1$ for the 22 at. % Ga composition is 10 MPa, roughly 2 times the bulk value and smaller than the bulk-like value of $-B_1$=12.1 MPa obtained for a film with 17 at. % Ga. This enhancement is correlated with the A2 crystal structure for the film rather than the coexistence with D0$_3$ or other ordered nanometric precipitates proposed for bulk samples. Synchrotron diffraction excludes the formation of long-range L6$_0$, or D0$_3$ precipitates in samples with (001)A2 peaks at concentrations around 25 at. % Ga, which implies partial chemical disorder. The analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements points to a D0$_3$ local order with a residual number of Ga-Ga pairs. Considering that the substrate quenches the movable strain in the A2 phase described in dual-phase structures, our results point to the important role of the electronic structure of the iron atoms modified by the presence of Ga in the alloy. This effect enlarges $B_1$ in films with the A2 phase, stabilized using epitaxial growth.

Title: Learning in a Multifield Coherent Ising Machine
Authors: Daan de Bos, Marc Serra-Garcia
Abstract: Physical information processors can learn from examples if they are modified according to an abstract parameter update equation, termed a learning rule. We introduce a physical model for self-learning that encodes the learning rule in the Hamiltonian of the system. The model consists of a network of multi-modal resonators. One of the modes is driven parametrically into a bi-stable regime, forming a coherent Ising machine (CIM) -- that provides the long-term memory that stores learned responses (weights). The CIM is augmented with an additional spinor field that acts as short-term (activation) memory. We numerically demonstrate that, in the presence of suitable nonlinear interactions between the long-term memory Ising machine and the short-term memory auxiliary field, the system autonomously learns from examples.

Title: Review on thermoelectric properties of transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: I. Pallecchi, N. Manca, B. Patil, L. Pellegrino, D. Marre'
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are considered an advantageous alternative to their celebrated two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals akin compound, graphene, for a number of applications, especially those requiring a gapped and possibly tunable band structure. Thermoelectricity is one of the application fields where TMDs could indeed outperform graphene, thanks to their lower thermal conductivity, large effective masses, valley degeneracy, varied and tunable transport properties, as well as sensitivity of their band structures and phonon spectra to confinement. Yet, despite promising theoretical predictions, thermoelectric properties of TMDs have not been extensively investigated so far and a clear assessment of TMDs as viable thermoelectric materials, based on experimental results, is still missing. In this paper, we review the experimental findings of literature on thermoelectric properties of TMDs, to sort out the countless combinations of chemical compositions, doping, off-stoichiometry and sample forms which could potentially result in optimized and possibly competitive thermoelectric properties. Based on the experimental data of literature, we simulate the performance of an all-TMD thermoelectric device for practical application as a micron sized cryocooler or power generator.

Title: Spectral and Entanglement Transitions from Non-Hermitian Skin Pumping
Authors: Qingya Li
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has unveiled unconventional spectral, topological and critical phenomena, challenging traditional band theories. This thesis advances its understanding in three aspects. First, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is shown to protect real spectra in some ansatz models, not relying on crystal symmetries. Second, we discover the phenomenon of scaling-induced non-Hermitian exceptional criticality (SIEC), marked by a unconventional negative dip in entanglement entropy scaling, deviating from the well-established logarithmic behavior. A scaling-dependent generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) is developed to analytically predict this SIEC. Third, we formulate a theoretical framework for phase-space GBZs, extending the concept of the GBZ to position-dependent systems, particularly for those with spatially inhomogeneous NHSE hoppings. Unprecedented phenomena, including GBZ bifurcation which also protects the stability of real spectra, are revealed, introducing new forms of topological robustness governed by phase-space GBZ bifurcations. This thesis also explores the NHSE in Bethe lattices, where the hyperbolic-like lattice geometry gives rise to a hierarchy of loop sizes that leads to new forms of critical NHSE behavior.

Title: Irreversible multi-band effects and Lifshitz transitions at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface under field effect
Authors: Ilaria Pallecchi, Nicolo' Lorenzini, Mian Akif Safeen, Musa Mutlu Can, Emiliano Di Gennaro, Fabio Miletto Granozio, Daniele Marre'
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the irreversible effects of an applied electric field on the magnetotransport properties of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 conducting interfaces, with focus on their multiband character. We study samples of different types, namely with either crystalline or amorphous LaAlO3 overlayer. Our two-band analysis highlights the similarity of the electronic properties of crystalline and amorphous interfaces, regardless much different carrier densities and mobilities. Furthermore, filling and depletion of the two bands follow very similar patterns, at least in qualitative terms, in the two types of samples. In agreement with previous works on crystalline interfaces, we observe that an irreversible charge depletion takes place after application of a first positive back gate voltage step. Such charge depletion affects much more, in relative terms, the higher and three-dimensional dyz, dzx bands than the lower and bidimensional dxy, driving the system through the Lifshitz transition from two-band to single band behavior. The quantitative analysis of experimental data evidences the roles of disorder, apparent in the depletion regime, and temperature. Noteworthy, filling and depletion of the two bands follow very similar patterns in crystalline and amorphous samples, at least in qualitative terms, regardless much different carrier densities and mobilities.

Title: The uncollapsed LaFe2As2 phase: compensated, highly doped, electron-phonon coupled, iron-based superconductor
Authors: Ilaria Pallecchi, Akira Iyo, Hiraku Ogino, Marco Affronte, Marina Putti
Abstract: The recently discovered LaFe2As2 superconducting compound, member of the 122 family of iron pnictide superconductors, becomes superconducting below Tc=13K, yet its nominal doping apparently places it in the extreme overdoped limit, where superconductivity should be suppressed. In this work, we investigate the normal state of magneto- and thermo-electric transport and specific heat of this compound. The experimental data are consistent with the presence of highly compensated electron and hole bands, with around 0.42 electrons per unit cell just above Tc, and high effective masses around 3m0. The temperature dependence of transport properties strongly resembles that of conventional superconductors, pointing to a key role of electron-phonon coupling. From these evidences, LaFe2As2 can be regarded as the connecting compound between unconventional and conventional superconductors.

Title: Topology from Nothing
Authors: Jacob R. Taylor, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: Disorder remains a major obstacle to realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires, and we show how deep learning can be used to recover topological MZMs mitigating disorder even when the pre-mitigation situation manifests no apparent topology. The disorder potential, as well as the scattering invariant ($T_V$) normally used to classify a device as topologically non-trivial are not directly measurable experimentally. Additionally, the conventional signatures of MZMs have proved insufficient due to their being accidentally replicated by disorder-induced trivial states. Recent advances in machine learning provide a novel method to solve these problems, allowing the underlying topology, suppressed by disorder, to be recovered using effective mitigation procedures. In this work, we leverage a vision transformer neural network trained on conductance measurements along with a CMA-ES optimization framework to dynamically tune gate voltages mitigating disorder effects. Unlike prior efforts that relied on indirect cost functions, our method directly optimizes $T_V$ alongside additional local density of states-based topological indicators. Using a lightweight neural network variant, we demonstrate that even highly disordered nanowires initially lacking any topologically non-trivial regions can be transformed into robust topological devices.

Title: Resolving the sodiation process in hard carbon anodes with nanostructure specific X-ray imaging
Authors: Martina Olsson, Antoine Klein, Nataliia Mozhzhukhina, Shizhao Xiong, Christian Appel, Mads Carlsen, Leonard Nielsen, Linnea Rensmo, Marianne Liebi, Aleksandar Matic
Abstract: Hard carbons show significant promise as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. However, monitoring the sodiation process in the hard carbon electrode during cycling and understanding the sodiation mechanism remain challenging. This article reports on operando 2D scanning small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS) and ex situ 3D SAXS tomography of hard carbon electrodes during the sodiation process. Structural changes are monitored with spatial and temporal resolution during the electrochemical process and shows that sodiation through micropore filling is the more dominating mechanism in the later stages of sodiation, i.e. in the plateau region of the voltage profile, while intercalation occurs continuously. Spatial inhomogeneities are resolved over the electrode and reveal an increased level of inhomogeneity at higher degree of sodiation with regions of different degrees of micropore filling. Resolving the processes spatially enables us to correlate plating, starting from the interface between the electrode and the current collector, to a higher degree of micropore filling. The work demonstrates how SWAXS imaging can contribute to understanding the sodiation of hard carbon anodes, not only by spatially resolved analysis, but also as a method to decouple contributions from different components in a cell, enabling more accurate scattering analysis in in situ environments.

Title: Correlative X-ray and electron tomography for scale-bridging, quantitative analysis of complex, hierarchical particle systems
Authors: Alexander Götz, Fabian Lutter, Dennis Simon Possart, Daniel Augsburger, Usman Arslan, Sabrina Pechmann, Carmen Rubach, Moritz Buwen, Umair Sultan, Alexander Kichigin, Johannes Böhmer, Nora Vorlaufer, Peter Suter, Tor Hildebrand, Matthias Thommes, Peter Felfer, Nicolas Vogel, Katharina Breininger, Silke Christiansen, Benjamin Apeleo Zubiri, Erdmann Spiecker
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive workflow for investigating particulate materials through combined 360° electron tomography (ET), nano-computed X-ray tomography (nanoCT), and micro-computed X-ray tomography (microCT), alongside a versatile sample preparation routine. The workflow enables the investigation of size, morphology, and pore systems across multiple scales, from individual particles to large hierarchical structures. A customized tapered sample shape is fabricated using focused ion beam milling with the aim to optimize each imaging technique's field of view, facilitating high-resolution analysis of small volumes containing single particles, while also allowing for large-scale studies of thousands of particles for statistical relevance. By correlating data from same locations in different imaging modalities, the approach enhances the precision of quantitative analyses. The study highlights the importance of cross-scale, correlative three-dimensional microscopy for a comprehensive understanding of complex hierarchical materials. Precise data registration, segmentation using machine learning, and multimodal imaging techniques are crucial for unlocking insights into process-structure-property relationships and thus to optimize functional, hierarchical materials.

Title: Superconducting phase diagram of finite-layer nickelates Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$
Authors: Andreas Hausoel, Simone Di Cataldo, Motoharu Kitatani, Oleg Janson, Karsten Held
Abstract: Following the successful prediction of the superconducting phase diagram for infinite-layer nickelates, here we calculate the superconducting $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ vs. the number of layers $n$ for finite-layer nickelates using the dynamical vertex approximation. To this end, we start with density functional theory, and include local correlations non-perturbatively by dynamical mean-field theory for $n=2$ to 7. For all $n$, the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital crosses the Fermi level, but for $n>4$ there are additional $(\pi, \pi)$ pockets or tubes that slightly enhance the layer-averaged hole doping of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals beyond the leading $1/n$ contribution stemming from the valence electron count. We finally calculate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the single-orbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Hubbard model by dynamical vertex approximation.

Title: Observation of a zero-energy excitation mode in the open Dicke model
Authors: Anton Bolian, Phatthamon Kongkhambut, Christoph Georges, Roy D. Jara Jr., José Vargas, Jens Klinder, Jayson G. Cosme, Hans Keßler, Andreas Hemmerich
Abstract: Approaching phase boundaries in many-body systems can give rise to intriguing signatures in their excitation spectra. Here, we explore the excitation spectrum of a Bose-Einstein condensate strongly coupled to an optical cavity and pumped by an optical standing wave, which simulates the famous Dicke-Hepp-Lieb phase transition of the open Dicke model with dissipation arising due to photon leakage from the cavity. For weak dissipation, the excitation spectrum displays two strongly polaritonic modes. Close to the phase boundary, we observe an intriguing regime where the lower-energetic of these modes, instead of showing the expected roton-type mode softening, is found to approach and persist at zero energy, well before the critical pump strength for the Dicke-Hepp-Lieb transition boundary is reached. Hence, a peculiar situation arises, where an excitation is possible at zero energy cost, but nevertheless no instability of the system is created.

Title: Efficient evaluation of the nonstabilizerness in unitary and monitored quantum many-body systems
Authors: Angelo Russomanno, Gianluca Passarelli, Davide Rossini, Procolo Lucignano
Abstract: We consider the quantum-state-diffusion dynamics of the staggered XXZ chain, also focusing on its noninteracting tight-binding limit, and of the SYK model. We describe the process through quantum trajectories and evaluate the nonstabilizerness (also known as ``magic'') along the trajectories, quantified through the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). To do that we introduce a numerical method to evaluate SRE, more efficient than the brute-force one, based on the expansion of the state restricted to a subspace in the computational basis of the classical spin configurations. In the absence of measurements, we find that the SYK model is the only one where the time-averaged SRE saturates the fully-random state bound and has a scaling with the system size that is well described by the theoretical prediction for quantum chaotic systems. In the presence of measurements, we numerically find that the asymptotic SRE versus the coupling strength to the environment is well fitted by a generalized Lorentzian function. The scaling of the fitting parameters with the system size suggests that the asymptotic SRE linearly increases with the size in all the considered cases.

We will provide an overview of recent advancements in understanding key quantities such as complex potential and transport coefficients for heavy impurities in finite temperature QCD and cold atomic systems.

Title: Analytical methods for cytoplasmic streaming in elongated cells
Authors: Pyae Hein Htet, Eric Lauga
Abstract: Cytoplasmic streaming, the coherent flow of cytoplasm, plays a critical role in transport and mixing over large scales in eukaryotic cells. In many large cells, this process is driven by active forces at the cell boundary, such as cortical cytoskeletal contractions in Drosophila and C. elegans embryos, or intracellular cargo transport in plant cells. These cytoplasmic flows are approximately Newtonian and governed by the Stokes equations. In this paper, we use lubrication theory - a powerful technique for simplifying the fluid mechanics equations in elongated geometries - to derive a general solution for boundary-driven cytoplasmic flows. We apply this framework to predict cytoplasmic fluid dynamics and cortical stresses in four systems of biological significance: the Drosophila and C. elegans embryos (including pseudocleavage furrow formation), the pollen tube of seed plants, and plant root hair cells. Our results showcase the elegance and accuracy of asymptotic solutions in capturing the complex flows and stress patterns in diverse biological contexts, reinforcing its utility as a robust tool for cellular biophysics.

Title: Nonreciprocal Control of the Speed of Light Using Cavity Magnonics
Authors: Jiguang Yao, Chenyang Lu, Xiaolong Fan, Desheng Xue, Greg E. Bridges, C.-M. Hu
Abstract: We demonstrate nonreciprocal control of the speed of light by sending a microwave pulse through a cavity magnonics device. In contrast to reciprocal group velocity controlled by conventional electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect, incorporating dissipative magnon-photon coupling establishes a non-reciprocal EIT effect, allowing slow and fast light propagation in opposite directions at the same frequency with comparable amplitude. Remarkably, reversing the magnetic field enables a directional switch between non-reciprocal fast and slow light. This discovery may offer new possibilities for pulse time regulation in microwave signal communications, neuromorphic computing, and quantum signal processing.

Title: A New Approach to Characterize Charge Transport and Hysteresis in Perovskite Solar Cells
Authors: Gabriel L. Nogueira, Victor Lopez-Richard, Luiz A. Meneghetti Jr., Fabian Hartmann, Carlos F. O. Graeff
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising photovoltaic technology, already achieving efficiencies surpassing 25%. However, effects such as hysteresis are commonly observed due to the interplay of ionic and electronic transport occurring over different timescales. Despite the widespread use of impedance spectroscopy (IS), physical interpretation in PSCs is specially challenging due to memory effects. In this study, we focus on integrating experimental data with an analytical device transport model. The PSCs under investigation were fabricated using a Cs$_{0.17}$FA$_{0.83}$Pb(I$_{0.83}$Br$_{0.17}$)$_3$ active layer between Nb$_2$O$_5$/TiO$_2$ (compact/mesoporous) and Spiro-OMeTAD. Our fully analytical charge transport model incorporates independent charge transport channels, enabling the correlation of experimental observations in both dark and under illumination. We employed IS together with various voltammetry techniques to reveal the dynamics of the transport processes, including voltage pulses and both small and large amplitude sinusoidal excitations. Although small perturbations are commonly used in IS, our findings demonstrate that large sinusoidal excitation provides new valuable insights in the transition from capacitive to inductive-like responses. The proposed model based purely on charge trapping and generation effectively captures device behavior under both small and large voltages without inductive elements, validated through accurate simulations of hysteresis and other electrical phenomena.

Title: The Vendiscope: An Algorithmic Microscope For Data Collections
Authors: Amey P. Pasarkar, Adji Bousso Dieng
Abstract: The evolution of microscopy, beginning with its invention in the late 16th century, has continuously enhanced our ability to explore and understand the microscopic world, enabling increasingly detailed observations of structures and phenomena. In parallel, the rise of data-driven science has underscored the need for sophisticated methods to explore and understand the composition of complex data collections. This paper introduces the Vendiscope, the first algorithmic microscope designed to extend traditional microscopy to computational analysis. The Vendiscope leverages the Vendi scores -- a family of differentiable diversity metrics rooted in ecology and quantum mechanics -- and assigns weights to data points based on their contribution to the overall diversity of the collection. These weights enable high-resolution data analysis at scale. We demonstrate this across biology, materials science, and machine learning (ML). We analyzed the $250$ million protein sequences in the protein universe, discovering that over $200$ million are near-duplicates and that AlphaFold fails on proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) functions that contribute most to diversity. Applying the Vendiscope to the Materials Project database led to similar findings: more than $85\%$ of the crystals with formation energy data are near-duplicates and ML models perform poorly on materials that enhance diversity. Additionally, the Vendiscope can be used to study phenomena such as memorization in generative models. We used the Vendiscope to identify memorized training samples from $13$ different generative models and found that the best-performing ones often memorize the training samples that contribute least to diversity. Our findings demonstrate that the Vendiscope can serve as a powerful tool for data-driven science.

Title: Dephasing enhanced transport of spin excitations in a two dimensional lossy lattice
Authors: Andrei Skalkin, Razmik Unanyan, Michael Fleischhauer
Abstract: Noise is commonly regarded as an adverse effect disrupting communication and coher- ent transport processes or limiting their efficiency. However, as has been shown for example for small light-harvesting protein complexes decoherence processes can play a significant role in facilitating transport processes, a phenomenon termed environment- assisted quantum transport (ENAQT). We here study numerically and analytically how dephasing noise improves the efficiency of spin excitation transport in a two dimen- sional lattice with small homogeneous losses. In particular we investigate the efficiency and time of excitation transfer from a random initial site to a specific target site and show that for system sizes below a characteristic scale it can be substantially enhanced by adding small dephasing noise. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the efficiency which become rather accurate in the two limits of small (coherent regime) and large noise (Zeno regime) and give a very good overall estimate. These analytic expressions provide a quantitative description of ENAQT in spatially extended systems and allow to derive conditions for its existence.

Title: Classical elasticity meets quantum complexity: A connection from the holographic lens
Authors: Yuanceng Xu, Wei-Jia Li
Abstract: In this work, we explore the effects of shear deformations in a wide class of holographic amorphous solids. It is found that both the shear stress and the complexity of formation grow with the increase of the shear strain. Notably, in the regime of very large shear, they exhibit coordinated behavior and adhere to a universal scaling relation, uncovering a surprising connection between two seemingly unrelated aspects of amorphous systems. Furthermore, our findings also provide a counterexample to the previous understanding that the complexity scales linearly with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for large static black holes.

Title: SVM/SVR Kernels as Quantum Propagators
Authors: Nan-Hong Kuo, Tsung-Wei Chiang, Renata Wong
Abstract: In this work, we establish the equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernels and quantum Green's functions. Drawing on the analogy between margin maximization in SVMs and action extremization in Lagrangian mechanics, we show that many standard kernels correspond naturally to Green's functions and that this correspondence arises from the inversion of physical operators. We further demonstrate how positive semi-definiteness, which is essential for valid SVM kernels, aligns with the spectral properties that ensure well-defined Green's functions. We employ the Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) to create custom kernels for cases where the commonly employed kernels don't lead to a convergence. These custom kernels approximate the desired Green's functions. We furthermore demonstrate numerically on examples taken from physical problems, such as electrical conductivity, scattering amplitudes, photonic crystals, and energy levels of anharmonic oscillators, that selecting kernel functions that mirror the mathematical form of the associated Green's function can significantly enhance the predictive accuracy of machine learning models.

Title: Microvortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes
Authors: Udaya Maurya, Surya Teja Gavva, Arpan Saha, Rickmoy Samanta
Abstract: We construct 2D viscous flow sourced by a point vortex embedded in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincaré Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian on the cylinder, which depends on the fluid viscosities and vortex strengths. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, distinct from flat and spherical fluid membranes. For a two vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time. The compact angular direction of the membrane tube also allows two distinct closed orbits instead of one, under suitable initial conditions. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999). We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).

Title: A Radio-Frequency Emitter Design for the Low-Frequency Regime in Atomic Experiments
Authors: Yudong Wei, Zhongshu Hu, Yajing Guo, Zhentian Qian, Shengjie Jin, Xuzong Chen, Xiong-jun Liu
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) control is a key technique in cold atom experiments. Here, we present a new design based on virtual load, where a low-frequency coil with a frequency of up to 30\,MHz, functions as both an inductor and a power-sharing element in a capacitive transformer circuit. This design enables a highly efficient RF circuit with tunable matching bandwidth. It integrates broadband and narrowband coils into a compact configuration, overcoming the distance limitations of metallic chambers. The broadband RF system, tested in a 10-second evaporative cooling experiment, reduced input power from 14.7\,dBW to -3.5\,dBW due to its low-pass behavior, effectively cooling the Bose-Fermi mixture to below 10\,$\mu$K. The narrowband RF system was tested in a Landau-Zener experiment and transferred 80\,\% of Rb atoms from |F=2, m_F=2> to |2, -2> in 1 second, yielding a Rabi frequency of 7.6\,kHz at 0.1\,dBW. The power-sharing properties of the virtual load ensure impedance closely matches the ideal lumped-element simulations, demonstrating the design's robustness to disturbances.

Abstract: We present an ultra-compact source of maximally entangled on-demand photon pairs. Our results are based on coupling of single GaAs quantum dots that are embedded in monolithic micro-lenses to a single-mode fiber with directly attached to 3D-printed micro-optics (NA of 0.6) inside a cryogenic environment. This approach, which is geared towards future integration into industrial environments, yields state-of-the-art entangled photon pair creation performance while retaining flexibility and adjustability required for long-term operation of such a device - all while dramatically reducing the overall system footprint. We demonstrate near diffraction-limited performance and hyperspectral imaging utilizing a 3D-printed micro-objective with a full width at half maximum resolution limit of 604(16) nm when operating the system at a cryogenic temperature of 3.8 K. Furthermore, we prove that this system can be used to achieve single photon emission rates of 392(20) kHz at a 76 MHz pump rate and purities of 99.2(5) % using two-photon resonant excitation. Utilizing the exciton-biexciton emission cascade available in GaAs quantum dots under resonant excitation, near maximally entangled photon pairs with peak entanglement negatives 2n of 0.96(2) in a 4 ps time window, and 0.81(1) when averaged over one exciton lifetime, are demonstrated.

Title: Time crystal optomechanics
Authors: J. T. Mäkinen, P. J. Heikkinen, S. Autti, V. V. Zavjalov, V. B. Eltsov
Abstract: Time crystals are an enigmatic phase of matter in which a quantum mechanical system displays repetitive, observable motion - they spontaneously break the time translation symmetry. On the other hand optomechanical systems, where mechanical and optical degrees of freedom are coupled, are well established and enable a range of applications and measurements with unparalleled precision. Here, we connect a time crystal formed of magnetic quasiparticles, magnons, to a mechanical resonator, a gravity wave mode on a nearby liquid surface, and show that their joint dynamics evolves as a cavity optomechanical system. Our results pave way for exploiting the spontaneous coherence of time crystals in an optomechanical setting and remove the experimental barrier between time crystals and other phases of condensed matter.

Title: Active gel theory for cell migration with two myosin isoforms
Authors: Nils O. Winkler, Oliver M. Drozdowski, Falko Ziebert, Ulrich S. Schwarz (Heidelberg University)
Abstract: Myosin II molecular motors slide actin filaments relatively to each other and are essential for force generation, motility and mechanosensing in animal cells. For non-muscle cells, evolution has resulted in three different isoforms, which have different properties concerning the motor cycle and also occur in different abundances in the cells, but their respective biological and physical roles are not fully understood. Here we use active gel theory to demonstrate the complementary roles of isoforms A and B for cell migration. We first show that our model can be derived both from coarse-graining kinetic equations and from nonequilibrium thermodynamics as the macroscopic limit of a two-component Tonks gas. We then parametrize the model and show that motile solutions exist, in which the more abundant and more dynamic isoform A is localized to the front and the stronger isoform B to the rear, in agreement with experiments. We then explore the parameter space of the model and find a general pull-and-push mechanism that can produce different migratory modes, including cell oscillations in length and velocity. We also describe an analytical solution for the stiff limit. Our findings highlight the importance of including isoform-specific molecular details to describe whole cell behavior.

Title: Evaluation of machine learning techniques for conditional generative adversarial networks in inverse design
Authors: Timo Gahlmann, Philippe Tassin
Abstract: Recently, machine learning has been introduced in the inverse design of physical devices, i.e., the automatic generation of device geometries for a desired physical response. In particular, generative adversarial networks have been proposed as a promising approach for topological optimization, since such neural network models can perform free-form design and simultaneously take into account constraints imposed by the device's fabrication process. In this context, a plethora of techniques has been developed in the machine learning community. Here, we study to what extent new network architectures, such as dense residual networks, and other techniques like data augmentation, and the use of noise in the input channels of the discriminator can improve or speed up neural networks for inverse design of optical metasurfaces. We also investigate strategies for improving the convergence of the training of generative adversarial networks for inverse design, e.g., temporarily freezing the discriminator weights when the model outperforms the generator and training data blurring during the early epochs. Our results show that only some of these techniques improve inverse design models in terms of accuracy and stability, but also that a combination of them can provide more efficient and robust metasurface designs.

Title: A novel method to determine the layer number of 2D TMD materials based on Optical Microscopy and Image Processing
Authors: Bilal Bera Meric, Ayse Erol, Fahrettin Sarcan
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dicakcoganite (TMD) materials have unique electronic and optical properties. The electronic band structures of the materials alter as a function of layer numbers, which results in modifications to the whole characteristic properties. Therefore, the determination of the layer number is crucial for optoelectronic applications. In this study, a fast and easily applicable method is proposed for determining the layer number of two-dimensional TMD materials by using an optical microscopy and computatial methods. The method uses image processing techniques on digital images taken with a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) camera under a conventional reflecting microscope. The chromaticity differences and lightness difference in International Commission on Illumination (Commission internationale de ,CIE) Luv color space values between the layered areas on the flakes and substrates are used together to train the model to be identified the layer numbers of the materials and corrected via photoluminescence spectroscopy. The random forest clasifier algorithm is applied to predict layer numbers on unknown materials. This approach provides high accuracy under varying microscope configurations such as brightnesses, gain etc. and material-substrate combinations. From ML to bulk whole layers numbers of MoS2, WSe2 and WS2 flakes are determined with high accuracy by training only a single flake of each has various layer numbers. Compared with traditional methods such as Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and photoluminescence (PL), our method is not only faster but also easier to apply. Moreover, unlike the prominent methods in the literature such as machine learning or clustering-based, it requires only single training for a material/substrate combination and further accelerates the processes.

Title: Non-invertible symmetry breaking in a frustration-free spin chain
Authors: Akash Sinha, Vivek Kumar Singh, Pramod Padmanabhan, Kun Hao, Vladimir Korepin
Abstract: A nearest-neighbor, frustration-free spin $\frac{1}{2}$ chain can be constructed {\it via} projectors of various ranks á la Bravyi-Gosset. We show that in the rank 1 case this system is gapped and has two ground states resembling ferromagnetic states. These states spontaneously break the non-invertible symmetry connecting them. The latter is proved using the machinery of algebraic quantum theory. The non-invertible symmetries of this system do not come from a duality.

Title: A versatile experimental method to measure the traction forces at interfaces
Authors: Yingwei Hou, Tao Liu, Yong Pang
Abstract: Measurement of surface forces, including cohesive forces and contact forces, is critical for understanding and controlling interactions at interfaces to optimize the interfacial performance of applications. The objective of this paper is to introduce a general in-situ method that enables the measurement of 3D micron-scale displacements and corresponding force distribution at interfaces in dry or wet environment. Stereo digital image correlation was used to measure the 3D-displacement of a soft and deformable substrate. The efficiency and accuracy of the technique were evaluated by applying compression to the substrate using a steel ball, with the measured 3D displacements aligning closely with finite element analysis simulations. To further assess the method's applicability, the wet adhesion between mussel plaques and substrate was tested under aqueous conditions. The interfacial displacements and forces at different stages during the test were measured. The application of the technique can be extended for varied circumstances regarding force range and substrate materials based on Winkler Spring model.

Title: Adiabatic Gauge Potential as a Tool for Detecting Chaos in Classical Systems
Authors: Nachiket Karve, Nathan Rose, David Campbell
Abstract: The interplay between chaos and thermalization in weakly non-integrable systems is a rich and complex subject. Interest in this area is further motivated by a desire to develop a unified picture of chaos for both quantum and classical systems. In this work, we study the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), an object typically studied in quantum mechanics that describes deformations of a quantum state under adiabatic variation of the Hamiltonian, in classical Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) and Toda models. We show how the time variance of the AGP over a trajectory probes the long-time correlations of a generic observable and can be used to distinguish among nearly integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. We draw connections between the evolution of the AGP and diffusion and derive a fluctuation-dissipation relation that connects its variance to long-time correlations of the observable. Within this framework, we demonstrate that strongly and weakly chaotic regimes correspond to normal and anomalous diffusion, respectively. The latter gives rise to a marked increase in the variance as the time interval is increased, and this behavior serves as the basis for our probe of the onset times of chaos. Numerical results are presented for FPUT and Toda systems that highlight integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. We conclude by commenting on the wide applicability of our method to a broader class of systems.

Title: Electrically tunable strong coupling in a hybrid-2D excitonic metasurface for optical modulation
Authors: Tom Hoekstra, Jorik van de Groep
Abstract: Atomically thin semiconductors exhibit tunable exciton resonances that can be harnessed for dynamic manipulation of visible light in ultra-compact metadevices. However, the rapid nonradiative decay and dephasing of excitons at room temperature limits current active excitonic metasurfaces to few-percent efficiencies. Here, we leverage the combined merits of pristine 2D heterostructures and non-local dielectric metasurfaces to enhance the excitonic light-matter interaction, achieving strong and electrically tunable exciton-photon coupling at ambient conditions in a hybrid-2D excitonic metasurface. Using this, we realize a free-space optical modulator and experimentally demonstrate 9.9 dB of reflectance modulation. The electro-optic response, characterized by a continuous transition from strong to weak coupling, is mediated by gating-induced variations in the free carrier concentration altering the excitons nonradiative decay rate. These results highlight how hybrid-2D excitonic metasurfaces offer novel opportunities to realize nanophotonic devices for active wavefront manipulation and optical communication.

Title: Nanoindentation of single crystalline Mo: Atomistic defect nucleation and thermomechanical stability
Authors: F. J. Domínguez-Gutiérrez, S. Papanikolaou, A. Esfandiarpour, P. Sobkowicz, M. Alava
Abstract: The mechanical responses of single crystalline Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) metals, such as molybdenum (Mo), outperform other metals at high temperatures, so much so that they are considered as excellent candidates for applications under extreme conditions, such as the divertor of fusion reactors. The excellent thermomechanical stability of molybdenum at high temperatures (400-1000$^{\rm o}$C) has also been detected through nanoindentation, pointing towards connections to emergent local dislocation mechanisms related to defect nucleation. In this work, we carry out a computational study of the effects of high temperature on the mechanical deformation properties of single crystalline Mo under nanoindentation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of spherical nanoindentation are performed at two indenter tip diameters and crystalline sample orientations [100], [110], and [111], for the temperature range of 10-1000K. We investigate how the increase of temperature influences the nanoindentation process, modifying dislocation densities, mechanisms, atomic displacements and also, hardness, in agreement with reported experimental measurements. Our results suggest that the characteristic formation and high-temperature stability of [001] dislocation junctions in Mo during nanoindentation, in contrast to other BCC metals, may be the cause of the persistent thermomechanical stability of Mo.

Title: Parameterizing empirical interatomic potentials for predicting thermophysical properties via an irreducible derivative approach: the case of ThO$_2$ and UO$_2$
Authors: Shuxiang Zhou, Chao Jiang, Enda Xiao, Sasaank Bandi, Michael W.D. Cooper, Miaomiao Jin, David H Hurley, Marat Khafizov, Chris A. Marianetti
Abstract: The accuracy of classical physical property predictions using molecular dynamics simulations is determined by the quality of the interatomic potentials. Here we introduce a training approach for empirical interatomic potentials (EIPs) which is well suited for capturing phonons and phonon-related properties. Our approach is based on direct comparisons of the second- and third-order irreducible derivatives between an EIP and the Born-Oppenheimer potential within density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Irreducible derivatives fully exploit space group symmetry and allow for training without redundant information. We demonstrate the fidelity of our approach in the context of ThO$_2$ and UO$_2$, where we optimize parameters of an embedded-atom method potential in addition to core-shell interactions. Our EIPs provide thermophysical properties in good agreement with DFT and outperform widely utilized EIPs for phonon dispersion and thermal conductivity predictions. Reasonable estimates of thermal expansion and formation energies of Frenkel pairs are also obtained.

Title: Topological two-band electron-hole superconductors with $d$-wave symmetry: Absence of Dirac quasiparticle annihilation in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene
Authors: Senne Van Loon, Carlos A. R. Sa de Melo
Abstract: We discuss a two-band model for two-dimensional superconductors with electron and hole bands separated by an energy gap and singlet $d$-wave pairing in each band. This type of model exhibits a V-shaped to U-shaped transition in the density of the states of the superconductor, and was phenomenologically used as a possible interpretation of recent tunneling experiments in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG)~[Kim {\it et al.}, Nature {\bf 606}, 494-500 (2022)]. Performing a microscopic investigation, we find that such a qualitative difference in behavior occurs when the electron and hole chemical potentials change, leading to topological quantum phase transitions (TQPTs) between gapless and gapped $d$-wave superconducting states, due to the annihilation of chiral Dirac fermions at the phase boundaries. This transition requires the vanishing of the coherence peaks in the density of states at zero energy when the phase boundary is crossed, but this is not seen in the experimental data of Kim {\it et al.} (2022). We also show that direct thermodynamic signatures of these topological quantum phase transitions arise in the theoretical compressibility, which exhibits logarithmic singularities at the transition points. Measurements of the compressibility may illuminate the interpretation of the experimental data of Kim {\it et al.} (2022) and provide additional information about topological quantum phase transitions in the superconducting state of MATTG. Based on our analysis, we are led to conclude that the V-shaped to U-shaped transition observed is not related to annihilation of Dirac fermion quasiparticles and its associated TQPTs, but is possibly connected to a change in symmetry of the order parameter from a nodal to a non-nodal superconducting phase.

Title: Quantifying `local softness' in a simple liquid
Authors: Tamoghna Das
Abstract: Mutual information between local stress and local non-affine deformation is proposed as a collective field variable quantifying the {\em local softness} of soft materials. The liquid-solid transition in a simple liquid is considered as a generic example of mechanical transformation through varying correlation between stress and deformation at the microscopic level. Probing through this new measure, a liquid appears as a spatially heterogeneous medium of interacting interconnected regions of varying softness. In contrast, the soft regions shrink to isolated spots in the background of a negligible mean softness in the case of solids. In this view, the thermodynamic transition becomes purely geometric while keeping the essential mechanical information intact. Besides offering a general framework for understanding the mechanics of materials, this new approach can complement recent machine learning efforts by assigning physical meaning to their findings. Further, this collective variable can be used on the fly during material characterization as both of its ingredient variables are experimentally accessible.

Title: A Comparative Study of Enriched Computational Homogenization Schemes Applied to Two-Dimensional Pattern-Transforming Elastomeric Mechanical Metamaterials
Authors: S.O. Sperling, T. Guo, R.H.J. Peerlings, V.G. Kouznetsova, M.G.D. Geers, O. Rokoš
Abstract: Elastomeric mechanical metamaterials exhibit unconventional behaviour, emerging from their microstructures often deforming in a highly nonlinear and unstable manner. Such microstructural pattern transformations lead to non-local behaviour and induce abrupt changes in the effective properties, beneficial for engineering applications. To avoid expensive simulations fully resolving the underlying microstructure, homogenization methods are employed. In this contribution, a systematic comparative study is performed, assessing the predictive capability of several computational homogenization schemes in the realm of two-dimensional elastomeric metamaterials with a square stacking of circular holes. In particular, classical first-order and two enriched schemes of second-order and micromorphic computational homogenization type are compared with ensemble-averaged full direct numerical simulations on three examples: uniform compression and bending of an infinite specimen, and compression of a finite specimen. It is shown that although the second-order scheme provides good qualitative predictions, it fails in accurately capturing bifurcation strains and slightly over-predicts the homogenized response. The micromorphic method provides the most accurate prediction for tested examples, although soft boundary layers induce large errors at small scale ratios. The first-order scheme yields good predictions for high separations of scales, but suffers from convergence issues, especially when localization occurs.

Title: Nonequilibrium dynamics in Dirac quantum criticality
Authors: Yin-Kai Yu, Zhi Zeng, Yu-Rong Shu, Zi-Xiang Li, Shuai Yin
Abstract: Quantum criticality within Dirac fermions harbors a plethora of exotic phenomena, attracting sustained attention in the past decades. Nevertheless, the nonequilibrium dynamics therein has rarely been studied. To fill in the gap, we explore the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics in a typical Dirac quantum criticality belonging to chiral Heisenberg universality class. Performing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we unveil rich nonequilibrium critical phenomena from different initial states. Particularly, a new dynamic exponent characterizing the non-stationary evolution in the short-imaginary-time stage is determined as $\theta=-0.84(4)$, in sharp contrast with the prevalent belief that $\theta$ is positive as demonstrated in classical cases. Furthermore, we propose a universal dynamic scaling theory governing the fruitful nonequilibrium properties in Dirac quantum criticality. Armed with the scaling theory, we develop a new framework to investigate fermionic quantum criticality based on short-time dynamics, paving a promising avenue to fathoming quantum criticality in diverse fermionic systems with high efficiency.

Title: Site-selective polar compensation of Mott electrons in a double perovskite heterointerface

Abstract: Double perovskite oxides (DPOs) with two transition metal ions ($A_2$$BB^\prime$O$_6$) offer a fascinating platform for exploring exotic physics and practical applications. Studying these DPOs as ultrathin epitaxial thin films on single crystalline substrates can add another dimension to engineering electronic, magnetic, and topological phenomena. Understanding the consequence of polarity mismatch between the substrate and the DPO would be the first step towards this broad goal. We investigate this by studying the interface between a prototypical insulating DPO Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$ and a wide-band gap insulator SrTiO$_3$. The interface is found to be insulating in nature. By combining several experimental techniques and density functional theory, we establish a site-selective charge compensation process that occurs explicitly at the Mn site of the film, leaving the Ni sites inert. We further demonstrate that such surprising selectivity, which cannot be explained by existing mechanisms of polarity compensation, is directly associated with their electronic correlation energy scales. This study establishes the crucial role of Mott physics in polar compensation process and paves the way for designer doping strategies in complex oxides.

Title: Modelling the mechanics of 32 T REBCO superconductor magnet using numerical simulation
Authors: Arpit Kumar Srivastava, Enric Pardo
Abstract: High temperature REBCO superconducting tapes are very promising for high-field magnets. Under high magnetic fields there are high electro-mechanical forces, and thus concern for mechanical damage. Due to large screening currents and composite structure of the tape, the mechanical design of these magnets are not straightforward. In addition, many present designs use insulated winding. In this work we develop a novel two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element tool programmed in MATLAB that assumes the displacement field within linear elastic range. The stack of pancakes and a large number of REBCO tape turns are approximated as an anisotropic bulk hollow cylinder. Our results agree with uni-axial stress experiments in literature, validating the bulk approximation. Here, we study the following configuration. The current is first ramp up to below the critical current and we calculate the screening currents and the forces that they cause using the MEMEP model. As a case study 32 T REBCO superconductor magnet is simulated numerically. We have done complete mechanical analysis of the magnet by including the axial and shear mechanical quantities for each pancake unlike previous work where only radial and circumferential quantities are focused. Effect on mechanical quantities without screening current is also calculated and compared. It is shown that including screening current induced field strongly affect the mechanical quantities, specially the shear stress. The latter might be the critical quantity for certain magnet configurations. Additionally, in order to overcome high stresses, a stiff over banding of different material is considered and numerically modelled which significantly reduces the mechanical stresses. The FE based model developed is efficient to calculate the mechanical behaviour of any general superconductor magnet and its devices.

Title: A novel and fast electromagnetic and electrothermal software for quench analysis of high field magnets
Authors: Anang Dadhich, Philippe Fazilleau, Enric Pardo
Abstract: High-field superconducting REBCO magnets contain several coils with many turns. For these magnets, electro-thermal quench is an issue that magnet designers need to take into account. Thus, there is a need for a fast and accurate software to numerically model the overall performance of full-scale magnets. High temperature superconductors can be modeled using different techniques for electro-magnetic and thermal (finite element method) analysis. However, it takes a lot of time to model the electro-magnetic and electro-thermal behavior of superconductors simultaneously, especially for non-insulated or metal-insulated coils. In addition, most of the available methods ignore screening currents, which are an important feature of REBCO magnets. We have developed a novel software programmed in C++, which performs coupled electro-magnetic and electro-thermal analysis using variational methods based on Minimum Electro-Magnetic Entropy Production (MEMEP) and Finite Difference, respectively. The developed software, which takes screening currents into account, is applied to axi-symmetric fullscale magnets of more than 32 T field strength under the SuperEMFL project for thermal quench reliability during standard operation. We show that the magnets incorporating non-insulated coils are more reliable against quench than the metal insulated coils. Also, realistic cooling conditions at boundaries is essential for such simulations. The model developed can be used for a quick and complete electro-magnetic and electro-thermal analysis of superconducting high field magnets.

Title: Pressure-enhanced splitting of density wave transitions in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-δ}$

Abstract: The observation of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ under pressure, following the suppression of a high-temperature density wave state, has attracted considerable attention. The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.

Title: Non Equilibrium Transitions in a Polymer Replication Ensemble
Authors: Arthur Genthon, Carl D. Modes, Frank Jülicher, Stephan W. Grill
Abstract: The fuel-driven process of replication in living systems generates distributions of copied entities with varying degrees of copying accuracy. Here we introduce a thermodynamically consistent ensemble for investigating universal population features of replicating systems. In the context of copolymer copying, coarse-graining over molecular details, we establish a phase diagram of copying accuracy. We discover sharp non-equilibrium transitions between populations of random and accurate copies. Maintaining a population of accurate copies requires a minimum energy expenditure that depends on the configurational entropy of copolymer sequences.

Title: Tunable Ultra-Strong Magnon-Magnon Coupling Approaching the Deep-Strong Regime in a van der Waals Antiferromagnet
Authors: C. W. F. Freeman, H.Youel, A.K. Budniak, Z. Xue, H. De Libero, T. Thomson, M. Bosman, G. Eda, H. Kurebayashi, M. Cubukcu
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) magnons in van der Waals (vdW) materials offer substantial potential for applications in magnonics and spintronics. In this study, we demonstrate ultra-strong magnon-magnon coupling in the GHz regime within a vdW AFM, achieving a maximum coupling rate of 0.91. Our investigation shows the tunability of coupling strength through temperature-dependent magnetic anisotropies. We compare coupling strength values derived from the gap size from the measured spectrum with those calculated directly through the coupling parameter and show that the gap size as a measure of coupling strength is limited for the ultra-strong coupling regime. Additionally, analytical calculations show the possibility to reach the deep-strong coupling regime by engineering the magnetic anisotropy. These findings highlight the potential of vdW AFMs as a model case to study magnetisation dynamics in low-symmetry magnetic materials.

Title: Generic reduction theory for Fermi sea topology in metallic systems
Authors: Wei Jia
Abstract: The Fermi sea of a metal can host exotic quantum topology, which governs its conductance quantization and is characterized by the Euler characteristic ($\chi_F$). In contrast to the well-known band topology, which is determined by the global features of wave functions, the topology of such metallic systems is intrinsically linked to the geometry of the Fermi sea. As a result, probing and identifying $\chi_F$ in high-dimensional systems presents a challenge. Here, we propose a generic dimensional reduction theory for the Fermi sea topology in $d$-dimensional metallic systems, showing that $\chi_F$ can be determined by the features of so-called reduced critical points on Fermi surfaces. Moreover, we reveal that $\chi_F$ can be interpreted as a topological invariant of band topology by mapping a metallic system to a gapped system. Building on this nontrivial result, we identify a broad class of topological superconductors (SCs) whose topological numbers are precisely determined by the $\chi_F$ of their normally filled bands. This provides an indirect method to capture $\chi_F$ by measuring the (pseudo)spin polarizations of these topological SCs. Our findings are expected to significantly advance research into Fermi sea topology.

Title: Revealing Symmetry-Broken Superconducting Configurations by Density Functional Theory
Authors: Zi-Kui Liu, Shun-Li Shang
Abstract: A coherent theory for the superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. Here we show that superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for charge density of electrons and/or holes as revealed by the calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The SODTs act as resistance-free superhighways and are correlated to the Cooper pairs in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be represented by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC predicted by DFT. The present work highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are embedded within the bulk materials and are easily destroyed by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (T_C). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk materials, maintaining SODTs' stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher T_C. The present approach is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the presently predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor of YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.

Title: Josephson junction of minimally twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Ritajit Kundu, Arijit Kundu
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the transport properties of Josephson junctions composed of superconductor/minimally twisted bilayer graphene/superconductor structures. In the presence of an out-of-plane electric field, the low energy physics is best described by a network of chiral domain-wall states. Depending on system parameters, they lead to the emergence of zig-zag or pseudo-Landau level modes with distinct transport characteristics. Specifically, we find zig-zag modes feature linear dispersion of Andreev bound states, resulting in a $4\pi$-periodic Josephson current. In contrast, pseudo-Landau level modes exhibit flat Andreev bound states and, consequently, a vanishing bulk Josephson current. Interestingly, edge states can give rise to $4\pi$-periodic Josephson response in the pseudo-Landau level regime. We also discuss experimental signatures of such responses.

Title: Light-induced torque in ferromagnetic metals via orbital angular momentum generated by photon-helicity
Authors: Koki Nukui, Satoshi Iihama, Kazuaki Ishibashi, Shogo Yamashita, Akimasa Sakuma, Philippe Scheid, Grégory Malinowski, Michel Hehn, Stéphane Mangin, Shigemi Mizukami
Abstract: We investigated photon-helicity-induced magnetization precession in Co$_{1-x}$Pt$_{x}$ alloy thin films. In addition to field-like torque, attributable to magnetic field generation owing to {\it the inverse Faraday effect}, we observed non-trivial and large damping-like torque which has never been discussed for single ferromagnetic layer. The composition dependence of those two torques is effectively elucidated by a model that considers mutual coupling via spin-orbit interaction between magnetization and the electronic orbital angular momentum generated by photon-helicity. This work significantly enhances our understanding of the physics relevant to the interplay of photon-helicity and magnetization in magnetic metals.

Title: Emergent Gauge Fields in Band Insulators
Authors: Zhaoyu Han, Steven Kivelson
Abstract: By explicit microscopic construction involving a mapping to a quantum vertex model subject to the `ice rule,' we show that an electronically `trivial' band insulator with suitable vibrational (phonon) degrees of freedom can host a ``resonating valence-bond'' state - a quantum phase with emergent gauge fields. This novel type of band insulator is identifiable by the existence of emergent gapless `photon' modes and deconfined excitations, the latter of which carry non-quantized mobile charges. We suggest that such phases may exist in the quantum regimes of various nearly ferroelectric materials.

Title: Projected Augmented Waves (PAW): extended resolution of unity method
Authors: Garry Goldstein
Abstract: The Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) method is based on a linear transformation between the pseudo wavefunctions and the all electron wavefunctions. To obtain high accuracy with this method, it is important that the local part of the linear transform (inside each atomic sphere) be defined over a complete basis set (with deviations from completeness leading to corrections to the total energy not computed within current implementations of PAW). Here we show how to make this basis much closer to complete without significant additional computational work and without modifying the transformation in any significant way. This is done by extending the resolution of unity used for the transform to include more smooth wavefunctions (which have nothing to do with the atomic problem) and having them linearly transform via the identity.

Title: Vertex Representation of Hyperbolic Tensor Networks
Authors: Matej Mosko, Maria Polackova, Roman Krcmar, Andrej Gendiar
Abstract: We propose a vertex representation of the tensor network (TN) for classical spin systems on hyperbolic lattices. The tensors form a network of regular $p$-sided polygons ($p>4$) with the coordination number four. The response to multi-state spin systems on the hyperbolic TN is analyzed for their entire parameter space. We show that entanglement entropy is sensitive to distinguish various hyperbolic geometries whereas other thermodynamic quantities are not. We test the numerical accuracy of vertex TNs in the phase transitions of the first, second, and infinite order at the point of maximal entanglement entropy. The hyperbolic structure of TNs induces non-critical properties in the bulk although boundary conditions significantly affect the total free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Thus developed vertex-type TN can be used for the lowest-energy quantum states on the hyperbolic lattices.

Title: Physical meaning of nonextensive term in Massieu functions
Authors: Miguel Hoyuelos, Matías A. Di Muro, Patricia Giménez
Abstract: In this paper we explore the significance of nonextensive terms in Massieu functions. Finite-size effects are in many cases dominated by a term proportional to the surface area. Nevertheless, in numerical simulations of finite systems with periodic boundary conditions, the nonextensive term can become the dominant correction to Massieu functions. This paper presents a general approach linking these nonextensive terms to thermodynamic fluctuations, demonstrating that equations of state inherently encode this information. Numerical simulations corroborate our results. The examples used are hard sphere and hard disk fluids and a one-dimensional spin lattice, emphasizing the applicability of the results across different classes of systems.

Title: SimXRD-4M: Big Simulated X-ray Diffraction Data Accelerate the Crystal Symmetry Classification
Authors: Bin Cao, Yang Liu, Zinan Zheng, Ruifeng Tan, Jia Li, Tong-yi Zhang
Abstract: Spectroscopic data, particularly diffraction data, contain detailed crystal and microstructure information and thus are crucial for materials discovery. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are greatly effective in identifying crystals. Although machine learning (ML) has significantly advanced the analysis of powder XRD patterns, the progress is hindered by a lack of training data. To address this, we introduce SimXRD, the largest open-source simulated XRD pattern dataset so far, to accelerate the development of crystallographic informatics. SimXRD comprises 4,065,346 simulated powder X-ray diffraction patterns, representing 119,569 distinct crystal structures under 33 simulated conditions that mimic real-world variations. We find that the crystal symmetry inherently follows a long-tailed distribution and evaluate 21 sequence learning models on SimXRD. The results indicate that existing neural networks struggle with low-frequency crystal classifications. The present work highlights the academic significance and the engineering novelty of simulated XRD patterns in this interdisciplinary field.

Title: Topological Dynamics and Correspondences in Composite Exceptional Rings
Authors: Zhoutao Lei, Yuangang Deng
Abstract: The study of unconventional phases and elucidation of correspondences between topological invariants and their intriguing properties are pivotal in topological physics. Here, we investigate a complex exceptional ring (CER), composed of a third-order exceptional ring and multiple Weyl exceptional rings, and establish a direct correspondence between Chern numbers and the distinctive behaviors of these structures. We show that band braiding during quasistatic encircling processes correlates with nontrivial Chern numbers, resulting in triple (double) periodic spectra for topologically nontrivial (trivial) middle bands. Moreover, Chern numbers predict mode transfer during dynamical encircling. Experimental schemes for realizing CER in cold atoms are proposed, emphasizing the crucial role of Chern numbers as both measurable quantity and descriptor of exceptional physics in dissipative systems. This discovery broadens topological classifications in non-Hermitian systems, with promising applications in quantum computing and metrology.

Title: Insulating and metallic phases in the one-dimensional Hubbard-Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model: Insights from a backflow-inspired variational wave function
Authors: Davide Piccioni, Francesco Ferrari, Michele Fabrizio, Federico Becca
Abstract: The interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions is studied in a one-dimensional lattice model, by means of a variational Monte Carlo method based on generalized Jastrow-Slater wave functions. Here, the fermionic part is constructed by a pair-product state, which explicitly depends on the phonon configuration, thus including the electron-phonon coupling in a backflow-inspired way. We report the results for the Hubbard model in presence of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger coupling to optical phonons, both at half-filling and upon hole doping. At half-filling, the ground state is either a translationally invariant Mott insulator, with gapless spin excitations, or a Peierls insulator, which breaks translations and has fully gapped excitations. Away from half-filling, the charge gap closes in both Mott and Peierls insulators, turning the former into a conventional Luttinger liquid (gapless in all excitation channels). The latter, instead, retains a finite spin gap that closes only above a threshold value of the doping. Even though consistent with the general theory of interacting electrons in one dimension, the existence of such a phase (with gapless charge but gapped spin excitations) has never been demonstrated in a model with repulsive interaction and with only two Fermi points. Since the spin-gapped metal represents the one-dimensional counterpart of a superconductor, our results furnish evidence that a true off-diagonal long-range order may exist in the two-dimensional case.

Title: Machine learning accelerated prediction of Ce-based ternary compounds involving antagonistic pairs
Authors: Weiyi Xia, Wei-Shen Tee, Paul C. Canfield, Fernando Assis Garcia, Raquel D Ribeiro, Yongbin Lee, Liqin Ke, Rebecca Flint, Cai-Zhuang Wang
Abstract: The discovery of novel quantum materials within ternary phase spaces containing antagonistic pair such as Fe with Bi, Pb, In, and Ag, presents significant challenges yet holds great potential. In this work, we investigate the stabilization of these immiscible pairs through the integration of Cerium (Ce), an abundant rare-earth and cost-effective element. By employing a machine learning (ML)-guided framework, particularly crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNN), combined with first-principles calculations, we efficiently explore the composition/structure space and predict 9 stable and 37 metastable Ce-Fe-X (X=Bi, Pb, In and Ag) ternary compounds. Our findings include the identification of multiple new stable and metastable phases, which are evaluated for their structural and energetic properties. These discoveries not only contribute to the advancement of quantum materials but also offer viable alternatives to critical rare earth elements, underscoring the importance of Ce-based intermetallic compounds in technological applications.

Title: Dynamical signatures of the Yang-Lee edge singularity in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Ming-Chu Lu, Shun-Hui Shi, Gaoyong Sun
Abstract: The Yang-Lee edge singularity is an intriguing critical phenomenon characterized by nonunitary field theory. However, its experimental realization for interacting many-body systems remains elusive. We show that Yang-Lee edge singularities, regarded as many-body exceptional points, can be observed using both the self-normal and the associated-biorthogonal Loschmidt echoes, leveraging the advantages of nonunitary dynamics in non-Hermitian systems. The Loschmidt echoes are demonstrated to display unitary dynamics in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime but exhibit nonunitary dynamics in the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry-broken regime, leading to a sharp change near an exceptional point. We hereby identify exceptional points in both the non-Hermitian transverse field Ising model and the Yang-Lee model, and determine the critical exponent that is consistent with nonunitary conformal field theory. This work provides a direct observation of Yang-Lee edge singularities in non-Hermitian many-body systems arising from nonunitary dynamics.

Title: Microscopic origin of liquid viscosity from unstable localized modes
Authors: Long-Zhou Huang, Bingyu Cui, Vinay Vaibhav, Matteo Baggioli, Yun-Jiang Wang
Abstract: Viscosity is the resistance of a liquid to flow, governed by atomic-scale friction between its constituent atoms. While viscosity can be directly computed using the Green-Kubo formalism, its microscopic origin remains poorly understood. In this work, we calculate the viscosity of a $\mathrm{Cu_{50}Zr_{50}}$ metallic liquid and a Kob-Andersen model in a large range of temperatures and compare the results with a theoretical formula based on nonaffine linear response and instantaneous normal mode theory. This analysis reveals that, above approximately the mode-coupling temperature ($T_{\text{MC}}$), unstable localized instantaneous normal modes (ULINMs) control the viscosity, suggesting a microscopic definition of it as diffusive momentum transport facilitated by local structural excitations mediated by ULINMs as precursors. On the other hand, at $ \approx T_{\text{MC}}$, we observe a dynamical crossover below which the viscosity is governed by stable modes. This behavior is compatible with the topological transition that emerges in the potential energy landscape between minima dominated dynamics ($T<T_{\text{MC}}$), corresponding to stable modes, and saddles dominated dynamics ($T>T_{\text{MC}}$), related to unstable ones. Finally, leveraging on the concept of configurational entropy, a quantitative model to connect viscosity with ULINMs is also proposed and validated in both the Arrhenius and non-Arrhenius regimes. In summary, our work provides a microscopic definition of liquid viscosity and highlights the fundamental role of ULINMs as its building blocks, ultimately opening the path to an atomic-scale prediction of viscosity in liquids and glasses.

Title: Models of interacting bosons with exact ground states: a unified approach
Authors: Zhaoyu Han, Steven A. Kivelson
Abstract: We define an infinite class of ``frustration-free'' interacting lattice quantum Hamiltonians for bosons, constructed such that their exact ground states have a density distribution specified by the Boltzmann weight of a corresponding classical lattice gas problem. By appropriately choosing the classical weights, we obtain boson representations of various known solvable models, including quantum dimer and vertex models, toric code, and certain Levin-Wen string-net models. We also systematically construct solvable models with other interesting ground states, including ``quantum spin liquids,'' supersolids, ``Bose-Einstein insulators,'' Bose liquids with ``Bose surfaces'', and Bose-Einstein condensates that permit adiabatic evolution from a non-interacting limit to a Gutzwiller-projected limit.

Title: Lee-Yang formalism for phase transitions of interacting fermions using tensor networks
Authors: Pascal M. Vecsei, Jose L. Lado, Christian Flindt
Abstract: Predicting the phase diagram of interacting quantum many-body systems is a challenging problem in condensed matter physics. Strong interactions and correlation effects may lead to exotic states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids and unconventional superconductors, that often compete with other symmetry broken states including ordered magnets and charge density waves. Here, we put forward a formalism for determining the phase diagram of fermionic systems that combines recent progress in the field of Lee-Yang theory of phase transitions with many-body tensor-network methods. Using this strategy, we map out the phase diagram of a fermionic chain, where charge density waves form owing to strong repulsion. Specifically, from the high cumulants of the order parameter, we extract the dominant zeros of the moment-generating function in chains of finite size. By extrapolating their positions to the thermodynamic limit, we determine the boundaries between competing phases. Our formalism provides a strategy for determining critical points in fermionic systems, and it is based on fluctuations of the order parameter, which are measurable quantities.

Title: A DFT+$U$+$V$ study of pristine and oxygen-deficient HfO$_2$ with self-consistent Hubbard parameters
Authors: Yudi Yang, Wooil Yang, Young-Woo Son, Shi Liu
Abstract: HfO$_2$-based ferroelectrics have emerged as promising materials for advanced nanoelectronics, with their robust polarization and silicon compatibility making them ideal for high-density, non-volatile memory applications. Oxygen vacancies, particularly in positively charged states, are suggested to profoundly impact the polymorphism kinetics and phase stability of hafnia, thereby affecting its ferroelectric behavior. The electronic structures of pristine and oxygen-deficient hafnia polymorph have been extensively studied using density functional theory, primarily employing (semi-)local exchange-correlation functionals. However, these methods often underestimate band gaps and may not accurately capture the localized nature of $d$-electrons. In this work, we investigate hafnia in various phases using DFT + $U$ + $V$, with onsite $U$ and intersite $V$ Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently via the pseudohybrid Hubbard density functional, ACBN0, and its extended version eACBN0. We find that the self-consistent DFT + $U$ method provides comparable accuracy to the computationally more expensive Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid density functional in predicting relative thermodynamic stability, band gaps, and density of states. Furthermore, it is a cost-effective approach for estimating the formation energies of oxygen vacancies. Additionally, we demonstrate that environmentally dependent Hubbard parameters serve as useful indicators for analyzing bond strengths and electronic structures in real space.

Title: Semi-Deterministic and Stochastic Sampling of Feynman Diagrams with 1/N$_f$ Expansions
Authors: Boyuan Shi
Abstract: We introduce a family of (semi) bold-line series, assisted with $1/\text{N}_{f}$ expansions, with $\text{N}_{f}$ being the number of fermion flavours. If there is no additional $\mathrm{N}_{f}$ cut, the series reduces to the RPA series in the density-density channel, complementary to the particle-hole and particle-particle channels introduced in [Phys. Rev. B $\textbf{102}$, 195122 (2020)]. We performed extensive benchmarks for density, energy and pressure with $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{t}'$ $\mathrm{SU}(\mathrm{N}_{f})$ Hubbard model on square lattice and honeycomb lattices over a wide range of numerical methods. For benchmark purposes, we also implement bare-$\mathrm{U}$ symmetry-broken perturbation series for the 2D SU(2) Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice, where we found encouraging results from weak to intermediate couplings.

Title: Capturing magic angles in twisted bilayer graphene from information theory markers
Authors: Manuel Calixto, Alberto Mayorgas, Octavio Castaños
Abstract: Zero energy eigenstates $\psi_0(\theta)$ of the twisted bilayer graphene Hamiltonian at the Dirac point show a high sensitivity to the twist angle $\theta$ near the magic angles where the effective Fermi velocity vanishes. We use information theory markers, like fidelity-susceptibility and entanglement entropy of the reduced density matrix to the layer sector, to capture this quantum criticality of zero modes at magic twist angles.

Title: DisQu: Investigating the Impact of Disorder in Quantum Generative Models
Authors: Yannick Werner, Jasmin Frkatovic, Vitor Fortes Rey, Matthias Tschöpe, Sungho Suh, Paul Lukowicz, Nikolaos Palaiodimopoulos, Maximilian Kiefer-Emmanouilidis
Abstract: Disordered Quantum many-body Systems (DQS) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) have many structural features in common. However, a DQS is essentially an initialized QNN with random weights, often leading to non-random outcomes. In this work, we emphasize the possibilities of random processes being a deceptive quantum-generating model effectively hidden in a QNN. When we choose weights in a QNN randomly the unitarity property of quantum gates is unchanged. As we show, this can lead to memory effects with multiple consequences on the learnability and trainability of QNN one would not expect from a classical neural network with random weights. This phenomenon may lead to a fundamental misunderstanding of the capabilities of common quantum generative models, where the generation of new samples is essentially averaging over random outputs. While we suggest that DQS can be effectively used for tasks like image augmentation, we draw the attention that overly simple datasets are often used to show the generative capabilities of quantum models, potentially leading to overestimation of their effectiveness.

Title: Einstein-de Haas effect: a bridge linking mechanics, magnetism, and topology
Authors: Xin Nie, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: The Einstein-de Haas (EdH) effect is a fascinating phenomenon that links mechanics and magnetism. Despite being discovered over a century ago, it remains significant in contemporary science, particularly within the fields of spintronics and ultrafast magnetism. Recent predictions suggest that the EdH effect may be realized in topological magnon systems, potentially leading to even richer properties. In this perspective, we introduce recent advancements in the EdH effect and discuss its developments in three key aspects: the microscopic mechanism, its manifestation in topological systems, and chirality-selective magnon-phonon coupling. Our discussions aim to inspire further explorations of the EdH effect and highlight its promising applications in different areas.

Title: Impact of the angular alignment on the crystal field and intrinsic doping of bilayer graphene/BN heterostructures
Authors: L. S. Farrar, G. Maffione, V.-H. Nguyen, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, J.-Ch. Charlier, D. Mailly, R. Ribeiro-Palau
Abstract: The ability to tune the energy gap in bilayer graphene makes it the perfect playground for the study of the effects of internal electric fields, such as the crystalline field, which are developed \Reb{when other layered materials are deposited on top of it}. Here, we introduce a novel device architecture allowing a simultaneous control over the applied displacement field and the crystalline alignment between two materials. Our experimental and numerical results confirm that the crystal field and electrostatic doping due to the interface reflect the 120$^{\circ}$ symmetry of the bilayer graphene/BN heterostructure and are highly affected by the commensurate state. These results provide an unique insight into the role of twist angle in the development of internal crystal fields and intrinsic electrostatic doping in heterostructures. Our results highlight the importance of layer alignment, beyond the existence of a moiré superlattice, to understand the intrinsic properties of a heterostructure.

Title: Temperature-Stable Tunneling Current in Serial Double Quantum Dots: Insights from Nonequilibrium Green Functions and Pauli Spin Blockade
Authors: David M T Kuo
Abstract: We theoretically investigate charge transport through serial double quantum dots (SDQDs) with strong electron correlations using nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. In the linear response regime, we compute the charge stability diagram and analyze the Coulomb oscillatory tunneling current, revealing both thermal and nonthermal broadening effects on the current spectra in relation to two gate voltages. In the nonlinear response regime, we focus on tunneling currents in SDQDs under the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) scenario. We find that current rectification with negative differential conductance is significantly degraded as temperature increases, making it challenging to distinguish between the inter-site spin triplet and singlet states. Notably, we observe a robust reversed tunneling current that remains stable against temperature variations, provided the resonant channel in the PSB scenario is coupled to the states of the right (left) electrode, which is fully occupied (unoccupied) by particles. This characteristic provides valuable insights for designing transistors capable of operating over a wide temperature range.

Title: Spin-$S$ Ising models with multispin interactions on the one-dimensional chain and two-dimensional square lattice
Authors: Kohei Suzuki
Abstract: We study spin-$S$ Ising models with $p$-spin interactions on the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice. Here, $S$ denotes the magnitude of the spin and $p$ represents the number of spins involved in each interaction. The analysis is performed for $S=1/2,1,3/2,2$ and $p=3,4,5$. For the one-dimensional model, we formulate transfer matrices, and numerically diagonalize them to analyze the temperature dependence of the free energy and spin-spin correlations. In the case of $S=1/2$, the free energy does not depend on $p$, and the spin-spin correlations are uniformly enhanced across all temperature scales as $p$ increases. In contrast, for $S \geq 1$, the free energy varies with $p$, and the spin-spin correlations are significantly enhanced at lower temperatures as $p$ increases. For the two-dimensional model, by using multicanonical simulations, we analyze physical quantities such as an order parameter, internal energy, and specific heat. In addition, we define and examine an order parameter to distinguish ordered and disordered phases. It is found that a first-order phase transition occurs at finite temperatures for all $S$ and $p\geq3$, and increasing $p$ strengthens its nature. We present $S$ and $p$ dependence of the transition temperature and latent heat, and discuss effects of higher-order interactions on the nature of phase transitions.

Title: A Spectral-based Physics-informed Finite Operator Learning for Prediction of Mechanical Behavior of Microstructures
Authors: Ali Harandi, Hooman Danesh, Kevin Linka, Stefanie Reese, Shahed Rezaei
Abstract: A novel physics-informed operator learning technique based on spectral methods is introduced to model the complex behavior of heterogeneous materials. The Lippmann-Schwinger operator in Fourier space is employed to construct physical constraints with minimal computational overhead, effectively eliminating the need for automatic differentiation. The methodology accelerates the training process by enabling gradient construction on a fixed, finite discretization in Fourier space. Later, the spectral physics-informed finite operator learning framework is built based on this discretization and trained to map the arbitrary shape of microstructures to their mechanical responses (strain fields) without relying on labeled data. The training is done by minimizing equilibrium in Fourier space concerning the macroscopic loading condition. The trained SPiFOL predicts full-field solutions for unseen cases accelerating the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) solvers by two orders of magnitude. The accuracy of the SPiFOL is investigated for a wide range of microstructures from dual-phase to multiphase materials and the homogenized stresses computed by SPiFOL show less than $1\,\%$ error compared to results obtained by conventional FFT solvers. SPiFOL is further enhanced by integrating a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), enabling the mapping of microstructures to mechanical responses using solely physical equations in Fourier space. Compared to the standard data-driven FNO, SPiFOL shows higher accuracy in predicting stress fields, Additionally, its zero-shot super-resolution capabilities are explored in heterogeneous domains. Finally, SPiFOL is extended to handle 3D problems and further adapted to finite elasticity, demonstrating the robustness of the framework in handling nonlinear mechanical behavior. SPiFOL achieves significantly higher speed-up factors compared to conventional FFT solvers.

Title: Growth of Large Area WSe2 and Observation of Photogenerated Inversion Layer in DMOS Configuration
Authors: Kajal Sharma, Abir Mukherjee, Kritika Bhattacharya, Biswarup Satpati, Dhiman Mallick, Samaresh Das
Abstract: Here, we report the full-fledged journey towards the material synthesis and characterization of few-layered/thin WSe$_2$ using sputtered W-films on SiO$_2$/Si substrates followed by electrical studies under dark and illumination conditions. Growth temperature 500oC and gas pressure 55 sccm are found to be the optimized parameters for formation of thermodynamically stable WSe$_{2-x}$ with dominant Raman peak at 265 cm-1. XRD and HR-TEM measurement clarify the formation of high crystallinity along the c-axis and quasi-crystallinity along a and b axes respectively. Lower intensities from Raman-measurement and PL-peak at 768 nm (with 532 nm excitation wavelength) infers the thin nature of the grown film, along with strong second harmonic emission with excitation wavelength varying from 350nm to 450 nm. This work also retracks the controlled etching by reactive ions to achieve large area bi/tri-layer films to fabricate advanced devices. We also have fabricated an advanced MOS structure on SiO$_2$/p-Si substrate which shows tremendous performance by means of photo-capacitance under illumination condition where photo-carriers can survive the higher probe frequencies (> 1MHz). Under illumination condition, HfO$_2$/WSe$_2$ embedded MOS shows its dominance showing a huge electron-inversion region over HfO$_2$/ SiO$_2$/p-Si and SiO$_2$/p-Si MOS devices even at high frequencies (1-10 MHz). Thereby, this work also reveals a possible route for capacitance based highly sensitive photodetection using conventional Si-technology with integration of such WSe$_2$/W as an active material.

Title: Ultrafast selective mid-infrared sublattice manipulation in the ferrimagnet $FeCr_2S_4$
Authors: Davide Soranzio, Matteo Savoini, Fabian Graf, Rafael T. Winkler, Abhishek Nag, Hiroki Ueda, Kenya Ohgushi, Yoshinori Tokura, Steven L. Johnson
Abstract: $FeCr_2S_4$ is a ferrimagnet with two oppositely ordered spin sublattices (Fe and Cr), connected via superexchange interaction, giving a non-zero net magnetic moment. We show, using time-resolved measurements of the magneto-optic Kerr effect, how the magnetic dynamics of the sublattices can be selectively manipulated by resonantly perturbing the Fe sublattice with ultrashort laser pulses. The mid-infrared excitation through intra-atomic Fe $d$-$d$ transitions triggers markedly slower dynamics in comparison to an off-resonant pumping affecting both of the two sublattices simultaneously. By changing probe wavelength to move in and out of resonance with the Fe $d$-$d$ transitions, we also show the specific contributions of the Fe sublattice to these dynamics.

Title: Anomalous energy transport in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase
Authors: Ken Hiura
Abstract: We study nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamic theories with charge and energy conservation in and above two dimensions that describe the large-scale behavior of the Hamiltonian XY model in the disordered and ordered phases. Using renormalization group analysis at one-loop order, we show that while Fourier's law holds in the ordered phase above two dimensions and in the disordered phase in any dimension, the energy diffusivity in the ordered phase exactly in two dimensions, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase, exhibits a logarithmic divergence in the thermodynamic limit. This divergence arises from elastic energy transport induced by spin-wave excitations.

Title: Room temperature Multiferroicity and Magnetoelectric coupling in Ca/Mn modified BaTiO3
Authors: P. Maneesha, Koyal Suman Samantaray, Rakhi Saha, Rajashri Urkude, Biplab Ghosh, Arjun K Pathak, Indranil Bhaumik, Abdelkrim Mekki, Khalil Harrabi, Somaditya Sen
Abstract: Materials with magnetoelectric coupling (MEC) between ferroic orders at room temperature are emerging field in modern technology and physics. BaTiO3 is a robust ferroelectric in which several doping has led to MEC. In Ca and Mn modified BaTiO3 has been study with a series of Ba(1-x)Ca(x)Ti(1-y)Mn(y)O3 (x=y= 0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09), in this MEC was only observed in x=0.03. The structural modifications with changing substitution reveal a reduced Ti-O-Ti bond angle for this sample which is the most ferromagnetic in nature. A mixed phase of tetragonal P4mm and hexagonal P63/mmc space groups of BaTiO3 is observed in the substituted samples, with nominal contribution of the hexagonal phase for x=0.03. A valence state study using XPS and XANES reveals the presence of enhanced proportion of Mn3+ ions in the sample which support a pseudo Jahn-Teller distortion, thereby supporting the ferroelectricity for x=0.03. Direct evidences of MEC was obtained from magnetoelectric measurements. A magnetoelectric coupling coefficient, {\alpha}ME ~44 mVcm-1Oe-1 was obtained for dc magnetic field of 600 Oe and a 10Hz ac field of 40 Oe. Such MEC was not observed for higher substitution which emphasizes the sensitivity of the structural properties on substitution.

Title: In-situ Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction Tensile Testing
Authors: Tijmen Vermeij, Amit Sharma, Douglas Steinbach, Jun Lou, Johann Michler, Xavier Maeder
Abstract: We present a methodology for in situ Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD) tensile testing that enables nanoscale characterization of the evolution of complex plasticity mechanisms. By integrating a modified in situ scanning electron microscope nanoindenter with a microscale push-to-pull device and a conventional Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) detector, we achieved TKD measurements at high spatial resolution during mechanical deformation. A dedicated focused ion beam procedure was developed for site-specific specimen fabrication, including lift-out, thinning, and shaping into a dog-bone geometry. The methodology was demonstrated on two case studies: (i) a metastable $\beta$-Ti single crystal, on which we quantified the initiation and evolution of nanoscale twinning and stress-induced martensitic transformation, and (ii) a $CuAl/Al_2O_3$ nanolaminate, which showed nanoscale plasticity and twinning/detwinning in a complex microstructure. Overall, this approach provides a robust alternative to in situ EBSD and transmission electron microscopy testing, facilitating detailed analysis of deformation mechanisms at the nanoscale.

Title: Room-temperature vacancy emission from the jog on edge dislocation in FCC nickel under glide force
Authors: Yifan Wang, Wu-Rong Jian, Wei Cai
Abstract: Jogs, atomic-scale steps on dislocations, play an important role in crystal plasticity, yet they are often ignored in discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations due to their small sizes. While jogs on screw dislocations are known to move non-conservatively (i.e. climb) accompanied by vacancy emission, jogs on edge dislocations are commonly expected to move conservatively (i.e. glide) with the dislocation under ambient conditions. Here we report unexpected findings from molecular dynamics simulations of an edge dislocation containing a pair of unit jogs in face-centered cubic nickel at 300K. While the jogs glide conservatively with the edge dislocation at low stresses, we observe that one of the jogs climbs and emits vacancies intermittently at higher stresses. This observation is unexpected at such a low temperature, as climb is typically associated with temperatures closer to the creep temperature (roughly half of the melting temperature). Our results highlight the significance of the complex interplay between point defects (i.e., vacancies) and dislocations in room-temperature plasticity, suggesting that these interactions may be more significant than previously thought.

Title: Coexistence of unconventional spin Hall effect and antisymmetric planar Hall effect in IrO$_2$
Authors: Yifei Yang, Sreejith Nair, Yihong Fan, Yu-Chia Chen, Qi Jia, Onri Jay Benally, Seungjun Lee, Seung Gyo Jeong, Zhifei Yang, Tony Low, Bharat Jalan, Jian-Ping Wang
Abstract: Crystal symmetry plays an important role in the Hall effects. Unconventional spin Hall effect (USHE), characterized by Dresselhaus and out-of-plane spins, has been observed in materials with low crystal symmetry. Recently, antisymmetric planar Hall effect (APHE) was discovered in rutile RuO$_2$ and IrO$_2$ (101) thin films, which also exhibit low crystal symmetry. However, the correlation between USHE and APHE remains largely unexplored. In this study, we report the observation of both USHE and APHE in IrO$_2$ (111) films, using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) and harmonic Hall measurements, respectively. Notably, the unconventional spin torque efficiency from Dresselhaus spin was more than double that of a previous report. Additionally, the temperature dependence of APHE suggests that it arises from the Lorentz force, constrained by crystal symmetry. Symmetry analysis confirms the coexistence of USHE and APHE in IrO$_2$ (111), paving the way for a deeper understanding of Hall effects and related physical phenomena.

Title: Diffusion equation and rare fluctuations of the biased aging continuous-time random walk model
Authors: Yuanze Hong, Tian zhou, Wanli Wang
Abstract: We explore the fractional advection-diffusion equation and rare events associated with the ACTRW model. When waiting times have a finite mean but infinite variance, and the displacements follow a narrow distribution, the fractional operator is defined in terms of space rather than time. The far tail of the positional distribution is governed by rare events, which exhibit a different scaling compared to typical fluctuations. Additionally, we establish a strong relationship between the number of renewals and the positional distribution in the context of large deviations. Throughout the manuscript, the theoretical results are validated through simulations.

Abstract: Disorder in the heterogeneous material stack of semiconductor spin qubit systems introduces noise that compromises quantum information processing, posing a challenge to coherently control large-scale quantum devices. Here, we exploit low-disorder epitaxial strained quantum wells in Ge/SiGe heterostructures grown on Ge wafers to comprehensively probe the noise properties of complex micron-scale devices comprising of up to ten quantum dots and four rf-charge sensors arranged in a two-dimensional array. We demonstrate an average charge noise of $\sqrt{S_{0}}=0.3(1)$ $\mu\mathrm{eV}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 1 Hz across different locations on the wafer, providing a benchmark for quantum confined holes. We then establish hole-spin qubit control in these heterostructures and extend our investigation from electrical to magnetic noise through spin echo measurements. Exploiting dynamical decoupling sequences, we quantify the power spectral density components arising from the hyperfine interaction with $^{73}$Ge spinful isotopes and identify coherence modulations associated with the interaction with the $^{29}$Si nuclear spin bath near the Ge quantum well. We estimate an integrated hyperfine noise amplitude $\sigma_f$ of 180(8) kHz from $^{73}$Ge and of 47(5) kHz from $^{29}$Si, underscoring the need for full isotopic purification of the qubit host environment.

Title: Measurement of $p$-wave contacts in an ultracold Fermi gas of $^6$Li atoms
Authors: Kenta Nagase, Soki Oshima, Hikaru Takahashi, Takashi Mukaiyama
Abstract: Using radio-frequency (RF) spectroscopy, we measure the $p$-wave contacts in a Fermi gas of $^6$Li atoms near the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance. The RF spectrum exhibits clear asymptotic behavior, characterized by $\tilde{\omega}^{-1/2}$ and $\tilde{\omega}^{-3/2}$ dependencies. The magnetic-field dependence of the $p$-wave contacts agrees reasonably well with the virial expansion theory in a detuned magnetic field range, validating the theory near the Fermi temperature. The $p$-wave contacts measured in this study constitute a second dataset, complementing the data obtained from the $^{40}$K system and contributing valuable insights into $p$-wave interactions in ultracold Fermi gases.

Title: Internal motion of soft granular particles under circular shearing: Rate-dependent quaking and its spatial structure
Authors: Jr-Jun Lin, Cheng-En Tsai, Jung-Ren Huang, Jih-Chiang Tsai
Abstract: Tightly packed granular particles under shear often exhibit intriguing intermittencies, specifically, sudden stress drops that we refer to as quaking. To probe the nature of this phenomenon, we prototype a circular shear cell that is capable of imposing a uniform and unlimited shear strain under quasi-static cyclic driving. Spherical PDMS(polydimethylsiloxane) particles, immersed in fluid, are driven in a fixed total volume at a wide range of shear rates, with particle trajectories captured in 3D space via refraction-index-matched fluorescent tomography. Statistics on the magnitude of fluctuating displacements of individual particles shows distinct dependence on the shear rate. Particle motions are smooth at high shear rates. At intermediate shear rates, quaking emerges with clusters of particles exhibiting relatively large displacements. At low shear rates, a cluster can span the entire system. and the cluster exhibits substructures in view of localized particle movements. Overall, we have confirmed that the quaking phenomena in the current setup are consistent with our previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett.,126, 128001 (2021)], and that the dimensionless shear rate that we have proposed [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 023065 (2024)] is indeed a good parameter for unifying the transitions observed in different experimental geometries.

Title: Pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization for frustrated XXZ spin-1/2 models with field or magnetization along the spin-Z direction at finite temperature
Authors: Frederic Bippus, Benedikt Schneider, Björn Sbierski
Abstract: The numerical study of high-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets remains a challenging problem. Here we present an extension of the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group to spin-1/2 XXZ type Hamiltonians with field or magnetization along spin-Z direction at finite temperature. We consider a $U(1)$ symmetry-adapted fermionic spin representation and derive the diagrammatic framework and its renormalization group flow equations. We discuss benchmark results and application to two anti-ferromagnetic triangular lattice materials recently studied in experiments with applied magnetic fields: First, we numerically reproduce the magnetization data measured for CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ confirming model parameters previously estimated from inelastic neutron spectrum in high fields. Second, we showcase the accuracy of our method by studying the thermal phase transition into the spin solid up-up-down phase of Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ in good agreement with experiment.

Title: One-step Fabrication of Sharp Platinum/Iridium Tips via Amplitude-Modulated Alternating-Current Electropolishing
Authors: Yuto Nishiwaki, Toru Utsunomiya, Shu Kurokawa, Takashi Ichii
Abstract: The platinum/iridium (Pt/Ir) alloy tip for scanning probe microscopy (SPM) was fabricated by amplitude-modulated alternating-current (AC) electropolishing. The clean tips with a radius of curvature less than 100 nm were reproducibly obtained by applying the sinusoidal voltage in the frequency ($f_0$) of $900\ \mathrm{Hz} \leq f_0 \leq 1500\ \mathrm{Hz}$ with amplitude modulation by the sinusoidal wave in the modulation frequency ($f_s$) of $f_s=0.1f_0$ in $\mathrm{CaCl}_2$/$\mathrm{H_2O}$/acetone solution. The analyses by scanning electron microscopy with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM-EDX) and atom probe tomography (APT) showed that a uniform Pt/Ir alloy was exposed on the tip surface as a clean surface without O or Cl contamination. The STM imaging using the fabricated tip showed that it is more suitable for investigating rough surfaces than conventional as-cut tips and applicable for atomic-resolution imaging. Furthermore, we applied the fabricated tip to qPlus AFM analysis in liquid and showed that it has atomic resolution in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Therefore, it is concluded that the amplitude-modulated AC etching method reproducibly provides sharp STM/AFM tips capable of both atomic resolution and large-area analyses without complex etching setups.

Title: Application of Madelung Hydrodynamics to Plasmonics and Nonlinear Optics in Two-Dimensional Materials
Authors: Simão S. Cardoso, A. J. Chaves, N. Asger Mortensen, N. M. R. Peres
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Madelung hydrodynamic models to study two-dimensional electron gases, with a focus on nonlocal plasmonics and nonlinear optics. We begin by reviewing the derivation of the Madelung equations. Using the Madelung equations in conjunction with Poisson's equation, we calculate the spectrum of magnetoplasmons and the magneto-optical conductivity in the electrostatic regime, incorporating nonlocal corrections due to the Fermi pressure. In the absence of a magnetic field, we analyze nonlinear and nonlocal second-harmonic generation, demonstrating how plasmon excitation enhances this process. We further discuss the emergence of self-modulation phenomena driven by nonlinearity, leading to the renormalization of the plasmon dispersion. Notably, we show that nonlinearity amplifies nonlocal effects and, leveraging the hydrodynamic formalism, derive a simple analytic expression for the renormalized spectra.

Title: Quantum geometric tensor and wavepacket dynamics in two-dimensional non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Y.-M. Robin Hu, Elena A. Ostrovskaya, Eliezer Estrecho
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) characterizes the local geometry of quantum states, and its components directly account for the dynamical effects observed, e.g., in condensed matter systems. In this work, we address the problem of extending the QGT formalism to non-Hermitian systems with gain and loss. In particular, we investigate a wave-packet dynamics in two-band non-Hermitian systems to elucidate how non-Hermiticity affects the definition of QGT. We employ first-order perturbation theory to account for non-adiabatic corrections due to interband mixing. Our results suggest that two different generalizations of the QGT, one defined using only the right eigenstates and the other one using both the left and right eigenstates, both play a significant role in wave-packet dynamics. We then determine the accuracy of the perturbative approach by simulating a wave-packet dynamics in a well studied physical non-Hermitian system -- exciton polaritons in a semiconductor microcavity. Our work aids deeper understanding of quantum geometry and dynamical behaviour in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Transmission of radio-frequency waves and nuclear magnetic resonance in lanthanum superhydrides
Authors: Dmitrii V. Semenok, Florian Bärtl, Di Zhou, Toni Helm, Sven Luther, Hannes Kühne, J. Wosnitza, Ivan A. Troyan, Viktor V. Struzhkin
Abstract: The discovery of near-room temperature superconductivity in the lanthanum hydride LaH$_{10}$ has revolutionized this field of research. However, the need to use diamond anvils for the synthesis of such superconductors severely limits the number of experimental techniques to study these materials. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the key methods for probing spin systems of superconductors. In this work, we show how $^1$H NMR measurements can be realized in diamond anvil cells to study high-temperature superconductivity in lanthanum polyhydrides at pressures up to 165 GPa. In the newly discovered superhydride LaH$_{12}$, we observed a pronounced suppression of the $^1$H NMR signal intensity below $\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 260 K in a magnetic field of 7 T, corresponding to the screening of the radio-frequency pulses. Below the critical temperature of superconductivity, all $^1$H NMR characteristics, including the spin-lattice relaxation rate $\textit{1/T$_{1}$T}$, demonstrate pronounced features, evidencing the bulk nature of the superconducting transition. In zero field, the radio-frequency signal transmission through the LaH$_{12}$ sample shows a pronounced drop below $\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 267 K, confirming the superconducting nature of the transition. A description of the $\textit{1/T$_{1}$T}$ data with an exponential form allows the estimation of the superconducting gap $\textit{${\Delta}$(0)}$ lying between 427 and 671 K (corresponding to 36.8 to 57.8 meV), and the ratio $\textit{R$_{\Delta}$ = 2${\Delta}$(0)/k$_B$T$_c$}$ between 3.76 and 5.16 in the synthesized hydride sample.

Title: A two-dimensional 10-qubit array in germanium with robust and localised qubit control
Authors: Valentin John, Cécile X. Yu, Barnaby van Straaten, Esteban A. Rodríguez-Mena, Mauricio Rodríguez, Stefan Oosterhout, Lucas E. A. Stehouwer, Giordano Scappucci, Stefano Bosco, Maximilian Rimbach-Russ, Yann-Michel Niquet, Francesco Borsoi, Menno Veldhorst
Abstract: Quantum computers require the systematic operation of qubits with high fidelity. For holes in germanium, the spin-orbit interaction allows for \textit{in situ} electric fast and high-fidelity qubit gates. However, the interaction also causes a large qubit variability due to strong g-tensor anisotropy and dependence on the environment. Here, we leverage advances in material growth, device fabrication, and qubit control to realise a two-dimensional 10-spin qubit array, with qubits coupled up to four neighbours that can be controlled with high fidelity. By exploring the large parameter space of gate voltages and quantum dot occupancies, we demonstrate that plunger gate driving in the three-hole occupation enhances electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR), creating a highly localised qubit drive. Our findings, confirmed with analytical and numerical models, highlight the crucial role of intradot Coulomb interaction and magnetic field direction. Furthermore, the ability to engineer qubits for robust control is a key asset for further scaling.

Title: DPmoire: A tool for constructing accurate machine learning force fields in moiré systems
Authors: Jiaxuan Liu, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng, Quansheng Wu
Abstract: In moiré systems, the impact of lattice relaxation on electronic band structures is significant, yet the computational demands of first-principles relaxation are prohibitively high due to the large number of atoms involved. To address this challenge, We introduce a robust methodology for the construction of machine learning potentials specifically tailored for moiré structures and present an open-source software package DPmoire designed to facilitate this process. Utilizing this package, we have developed machine learning force fields (MLFFs) for MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) materials. Our approach not only streamlines the computational process but also ensures accurate replication of the detailed electronic and structural properties typically observed in density functional theory (DFT) relaxations. The MLFFs were rigorously validated against standard DFT results, confirming their efficacy in capturing the complex interplay of atomic interactions within these layered materials. This development not only enhances our ability to explore the physical properties of moiré systems with reduced computational overhead but also opens new avenues for the study of relaxation effects and their impact on material properties in two-dimensional layered structures.

Title: Effective Lagrangian for the macroscopic motion of Weyl fermions in $^3$He-A
Authors: M. Selch, M. A. Zubkov
Abstract: We consider macroscopic motion of $^3$He-A in global thermodynamic equilibrium within the context of the Zubarev statistical operator method. We formulate the corresponding effective theory in the language of the functional integral. The effective Lagrangian comprising macroscopic motion of fermionic excitations is calculated explicitly for the emergent relativistic fermions of the superfluid $^3$He-A-phase in the non-trivial bosonic background due to a space and time dependent matrix-valued vierbein featuring nonzero torsion as well as the Nieh-Yan anomaly. The matrix-valued vierbein formulation comprises an additional two dimensional internal spin space which may be replaced by one featuring a fermionic theory with a real valued vierbein, two Abelian gauge fields and a spin connection mixing the Dirac and internal spin spaces. As an application of the developed theory we consider macroscopic rotation around the axis of the pure integer mass vortices. The corresponding thermodynamical quantities of the normal component are analysed.

Title: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis in a Quantum Point Contact Geometry
Authors: G. C. Levine, B. A. Friedman
Abstract: It is known that the long-range quantum entanglement exhibited in free fermion systems is sufficient to "thermalize" a small subsystem in that the subsystem reduced density matrix computed from a typical excited eigenstate of the combined system is approximately thermal. Remarkably, fermions without any interactions are thus thought to satisfy the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). We explore this hypothesis when the fermion subsystem is only minimally coupled to a quantum reservoir (in the form of another fermion system) through a quantum point contact (QPC). The entanglement entropy of two 2-d free fermion systems connected by one or more quantum point contacts (QPC) is examined at finite energy and in the ground state. When the combined system is in a typical excited state, it is shown that the entanglement entropy of a subsystem connected by a small number of QPCs is sub-extensive, scaling as the linear size of the subsystem ($L_A$). For sufficiently low energies ($E$) and small subsystems, it is demonstrated numerically that the entanglement entropy $S_A \sim L_A E$, what one would expect for the thermodynamics of a one-dimensional system. In this limit, we suggest that the entropy carried by each additional QPC is quantized using the one-dimensional finite size/temperature conformal scaling: $\Delta S_A = \alpha \log{(1/E)\sinh{(L_AE)}}$. The sub-extensive entropy in the case of a small number of QPCs should be contrasted with the expectation for both classical, ergodic systems and quantum chaotic systems wherein a restricted geometry might affect the equilibrium relaxation times, but not the equilibrium properties themselves, such as extensive entropy and heat capacity.

Title: Time-domain study of coupled collective excitations in quantum materials
Authors: Chenhang Xu, Alfred Zong
Abstract: Quantum materials hold immense promises for future applications due to their intriguing electronic, magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties that often arise from a complex interplay between microscopic degrees of freedom. Important insights of such interactions come from studying the collective excitations of electrons, spins, orbitals, and lattice, whose cooperative motions play a crucial role in determining the novel behavior of these systems and offer us a key tuning knob to modify material properties on-demand through external perturbations. In this regard, ultrafast light-matter interaction has shown great potential in controlling the couplings of collective excitations, and rapid progress in a plethora of time-resolved techniques down to the attosecond regime has significantly advanced our understanding of the coupling mechanisms and guided us in manipulating the dynamical properties of quantum materials. This review aims to highlight recent experiments on visualizing collective excitations in the time domain, focusing on the coupling mechanisms between different collective modes such as phonon-phonon, phonon-magnon, phonon-exciton, magnon-magnon, magnon-exciton, and various polaritons. We introduce how these collective modes are excited by an ultrashort laser pulse and probed by different ultrafast techniques, and we explain how the coupling between collective excitations governs the ensuing nonequilibrium dynamics. We also provide some perspectives on future studies that can lead to discoveries of the emergent properties of quantum materials both in and out of equilibrium.

Title: Comparison of NiFeCr and NiFe in ferromagnetic Josephson junctions
Authors: Joshua Willard, Swapna Sindhu Mishra, Robert M. Klaes, Nicholas J. Emtage, Reza Loloee, Norman O. Birge
Abstract: Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. Some memory applications rely on the ability to reverse the magnetization direction of a "soft" magnetic layer within the junction using a small local magnetic field generated on the chip. It is crucial, therefore, to find a suitable soft magnetic material with a low switching field and low switching energy. A popular magnetic material for such applications is Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, also known as Permalloy, however Permalloy has a rather large magnetization, leading to large magnetic switching energies. In this work we explore Cr-doped Permalloy, specifically Ni$_{73}$Fe$_{18}$Cr$_{9}$, which has a saturation magnetization just under two-thirds that of Permalloy. Josephson junctions containing this NiFeCr alloy undergo a 0-$\pi$ transition at a NiFeCr thickness of 2.3 nm, and the critical supercurrent decays in the alloy over a short characteristic length of 0.36 nm. Switching fields of a few millitesla are promising, but the short decay length and overall small values of the critical current in the Josephson junctions may preclude the use of NiFeCr in current cryogenic memory technologies.

Title: Energy density and stress fields in quantum systems
Authors: Richard M. Martin, Nithaya Chetty, Dallas R. Trinkle
Abstract: There has been an enduring interest and controversy about whether or not one can define physically meaningful energy density and stress fields, $e({\bf r})$ and $\sigma_{\alpha \beta}({\bf r})$ in quantum systems. A key issue is kinetic energy since $\frac{1}{2}|\nabla \Psi|^2$ and $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$ lead to different densities, and analogous issues arise interaction energies. This paper presents a resolution to the problems in two steps: 1) All effects of exchange and correlation are shown to be unique functions defined at each point ${\bf r}$; all issues of non-uniqueness involve only the density $n({\bf r})$ and are equivalent to a single-particle problem with wavefunction $s({\bf r}) = \sqrt{n({\bf r})/N}$. 2) Forms for the latter terms are proposed based on the nature of energy and stress, where energy has two distinct roles. Because the energy determines the ground state itself through the variational principle, the appropriate density involves the terms in the hamiltonian: $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$ and interactions in terms of potentials acting on the particles. This leads naturally to density functional theory with the interpretation that the energy density $e({\bf r})$ is equilibrated to minimize fluctuations with the same chemical potential throughout the system. On the other hand, the energy and stress (derivative of the energy with respect to strain) are properties of the ground state, and simple examples to show that the only acceptable expressions involve the combination $\frac{1}{4}[|\nabla \Psi|^2 - \Psi\nabla^2 \Psi]$, as derived by Schrodinger, Pauli and others, and Coulomb interactions in the Maxwell form in terms of electric fields, not potentials. Together these results lead to well-defined formulations of energy density and stress fields that are physically motivated and based on a clear set of arguments.

Title: Stokes flow in the electronic fluid with odd viscosity
Authors: Yonatan Messica, Alex Levchenko, Dmitri B. Gutman
Abstract: We investigate the transition between elastic and viscous regimes for time-reversal broken Weyl semimetals. In these materials, Hall transport occurs through two parallel channels: the Fermi sea and the Fermi surface. The Fermi sea part remains unaffected by electron-electron scattering, whereas the Fermi surface is influenced by it. We model the disorder by dilute impenetrable spherical impurities. We analyze the flow of an electronic fluid with a finite odd viscosity in the presence of such disorder and compute the conductivity tensor. We find that in the generic case of finite intrinsic conductivity, the Hall angle in the viscous regime is parametrically suppressed compared to the elastic regime. In the special case where the intrinsic conductivity vanishes, the ratio between the transverse and the longitudinal resistivities matches the ratio between the odd and even components of the viscosity tensor.

Title: Electronic States and Mechanical Behaviors of Phosphorus Carbide Nanotubes -- Structural and Quantum Phase Transitions in a Quasi-one-dimensional Material
Authors: Shivam Sharma, Chenhaoyue Wang, Hsuan Ming Yu, Amartya S. Banerjee
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials can manifest exotic electronic properties in manners that are distinct from the bulk phase or other low-dimensional systems. Helical symmetries in such materials -- e.g., nanotubes with intrinsic or applied twist -- can simultaneously lead to strong electronic correlation and anomalous transport behavior. However, these materials remain underexplored, in part due to computational challenges. Using specialized symmetry-adapted first-principles calculations, we show that mono-layer $P_2C_3$ -- identified in a previous letter to possess ``double Kagome bands'' -- exhibits a number of striking properties when rolled up into phosphorous carbide nanotubes ($P_2C_3$NTs). Both armchair and zigzag $P_2C_3$NTs are stable at room temperature and display a degenerate combination of Dirac points and electronic flat bands at the Fermi level. Notably, these flat bands are highly resilient to elastic deformations. Large strains can transform the nanotube structure from honeycomb-kagome to ``brick-wall'', and trigger multiple quantum phase transitions. Edge states in $P_2C_3$NTs, spin-degeneracy lifting induced by vacancies and dopants, and strain-tunable magnetism are also discussed.

Title: Strain induced topological phase transitions in split and line graphs of bipartite lattices featuring flat bands
Authors: Shivam Sharma, Amartya S. Banerjee
Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably, all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating, semimetallic, and topological phases. Our results highlight the potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.

Title: Enhancing Unconventional Spin-Orbit Torque Efficiency: Numerical Study on the Influence of Crystallographic Texture and Polycrystalline Effects on Low-Symmetry Materials
Authors: Yifei Yang, Jian-Ping Wang
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) has been extensively studied as a key mechanism in spintronics applications. However, conventional SOT materials limit the spin polarization direction to the in-plane orientation, which is suboptimal for efficient magnetization switching. Recently, spin currents with spin polarization along multiple directions have been observed in low-symmetry materials, offering a promising energy-efficient strategy for the field-free switching of magnetic materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. However, the efficiency of this mechanism is highly dependent on the crystallographic texture of the SOT materials, a critical factor that, to date, has not been quantitatively investigated. In this study, we present a comprehensive numerical investigation into the impact of both in-plane and out-of-plane crystallographic textures of SOT materials on the unconventional SOT generated by Dresselhaus-like and out-of-plane spin polarizations. By employing a theoretical orientation distribution function, we calculate the effective unconventional SOT values for SOT materials with tunable crystallographic texture. This analysis provides a framework for the synthesis and optimization of future low-symmetry SOT materials, which can enhance operational efficiency for spintronics applications in magnetoresistive random-access memory and spin logic devices.

Title: The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions
Authors: Subir Sachdev
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a 'large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed 'small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. Critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the FL-SDW quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the 'foot' of strange metal transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the 'fan' of strange metal behavior of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and the pseudogap metal is described by thermal fluctuations above a 'fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*) or a 'holon metal', with the descriptions related by a duality on a background spin liquid. The quantum critical fan is described using a field theory for an underlying FL-FL* quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder. This field theory can be mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully models linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations in the quantum critical fan. The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.

Title: Singularity and universality from von Neumann to Rényi entanglement entropy and disorder operator in Motzkin chains
Authors: Jianyu Wang, Zenan Liu, Zheng Yan, Congjun Wu
Abstract: The Rényi entanglement entropy is widely used in studying quantum entanglement properties in strongly correlated systems, whose analytic continuation as $n \to 1$ is often believed to give rise to the celebrated von Neumann entanglement entropy. However, this process for the colored Motzkin spin chain exhibits a singularity that yields different scaling behaviors of $\sim \sqrt{l}$ and $\sim \log{l}$ for the von Neumann and Rényi entropies, respectively. It can be understood by the exponential increasing desity of states in its entanglement spectrum. We have also employed disorder operators under various symmetries to study such a system. The analytical and numerical results reveal that the scaling of disorder operators is also $\log{l}$ in the leading term, the same as the Rényi entanglement entropy. We propose that the coefficient of the term $\log{l}$ is a universal constant, both in Rényi entropies and disorder operators, which could be used to identify the constraint physics of Motzkin walks.

Title: Rigorous Test for Quantum Integrability and Nonintegrability
Authors: Akihiro Hokkyo
Abstract: Whether or not a quantum many-body system is integrable, which is characterized by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities, drastically impacts the dynamics of isolated systems, including thermalization. Nevertheless, a rigorous and comprehensive method for deciding integrability or nonintegrability has remained elusive. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing rigorously provable tests for integrability and nonintegrability of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions. Our approach establishes a new paradigm, moving beyond the conventional artisanal methods in the study of nonintegrability. Furthermore, it partially resolves the long-standing conjecture that integrability is governed by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities with small supports. The proposed framework guarantees that the nonintegrability of one-dimensional spin systems with translational symmetry can be confirmed algorithmically, regardless of system size.

Abstract: We obtain the exact full counting statistics of a cellular automaton with freely propagating vacancies and charged particles that are stochastically scattered or transmitted upon collision by identifying the problem as a colored stochastic six-vertex model with one inert color. Typical charge current fluctuation at vanishing net charge follow a one-parameter distribution that interpolates between the distribution of the charged single-file class in the limit of pure reflection and a Gaussian distribution in the limit of pure transmission.

Title: Achieving electrode smoothing by controlling the nucleation phase of metal deposition through polymer-substrate binding

Abstract: Polymer additives [like polyethylene oxide (PEO)] are widely used for smooth electrode deposition in aqueous zinc and a number of other battery systems currently investigated for energy storage applications. However, the precise mechanism by which they regulate morphology and suppress dendrite formation remains unclear. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by using in-situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM) to directly observe the interfacial evolution during Zn electrodeposition and polymer adsorption on copper (Cu) substrates in the presence of varying concentrations of ZnSO4 and PEO. Contrary to previous literature assumptions which emphasize the binding to the growing Zn crystal surfaces or Zn2+ ions, our results demonstrate that PEO smooths Zn films by promoting nucleation of (002)-oriented Zn platelets through interactions with the Cu substrate. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations support this finding by showing that PEO adsorption on Cu modifies the interfacial energy of Zn/Cu/electrolyte interfaces, favoring the stabilization of Zn (002) on the Cu substrate, as well as confines Zn electrodeposition to a narrow near-surface region. These findings elucidate a novel design principle for electrode smoothing, emphasizing the importance of substrate selection paired with polymer additives that exhibit an attractive interaction with the substrate, but minimal interaction with growing crystals, offering a mechanistic perspective for improved battery performance.

Title: Fermion mediated pairing in the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida to Efimov transition regime
Authors: Geyue Cai, Henry Ando, Sarah McCusker, Cheng Chin
Abstract: The Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) interaction and Efimov physics are two distinct quantum phenomena in condensed matter and nuclear physics, respectively. The RKKY interaction describes correlations between impurities mediated by an electron gas, while Efimov physics describes universal bound states of three particles with resonant interactions. Recently, both effects have been observed in Bose-Fermi mixtures in the weak and resonant interaction regimes, respectively. Intriguing conjectures exist to elucidate how the two phenomena meet in the transition regime where the mixture is strongly interacting. In this work, we explore the RKKY-Efimov transition in a mixture of bosonic Cs-133 and fermionic Li-6 near a tunable interspecies Feshbach resonance. From dispersion and relaxation measurements, we find that the transition is highlighted by a fermion-mediated scattering resonance between Cs atoms and a weaker resonance on Li atoms. These resonances represent reactive scattering of Cs and Li atoms in the many-body regime, which reduces to an Efimov resonance in the thermal gas regime. Our observation demonstrates the intriguing interplay of two-, three-, and many-body physics in an Bose-Fermi mixture that connects condensed matter physics, nuclear physics and quantum many-body chemistry.

Abstract: Electronic flat bands associated with quenched kinetic energy and heavy electron mass have attracted great interest for promoting strong electronic correlations and emergent phenomena such as high-temperature charge fractionalization and superconductivity. Intense experimental and theoretical research has been devoted to establishing the rich non-trivial metallic and heavy fermion phases intertwined with such localized electronic states. Here, we investigate the transition metal oxide spinel LiV2O4, an enigmatic heavy fermion compound lacking localized f orbital states. We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and dynamical mean field theory to reveal a new kind of correlation-induced flat band with suppressed inter-atomic electron hopping arising from intra-atomic Hund coupling. The appearance of heavy quasiparticles is ascribed to a proximate orbital-selective Mott state characterized by fluctuating local moments as evidenced by complementary magnetotransport measurements. The spectroscopic fingerprints of long-lived quasiparticles and their disappearance with increasing temperature further support the emergence of a high-temperature bad metal state observed in transport data. This work resolves a long-standing puzzle on the origin of heavy fermion behavior and unconventional transport in LiV2O4. Simultaneously, it opens a new path to achieving flat bands through electronic interactions in d-orbital systems with geometrical frustration, potentially enabling the realization of exotic phases of matter such as the fractionalized Fermi liquids.

Title: Interpretable and Equation-Free Response Theory for Complex Systems
Authors: Valerio Lucarini
Abstract: Response theory provides a pathway for understanding the sensitivity of a system and, more in general, to predict how its statistical properties change as a possibly time-dependent perturbation is applied. Recently discovered general forms of the celebrated Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem allow for expressing response operators as correlation functions of suitably defined observables in the unperturbed state, also when such a state is far from equilibrium. In the case of complex and multiscale systems, to achieved enhanced practical applicability, response theory must be interpretable, capable of focusing of relevant timescales, and amenable to implemented by data-driven approaches that are potentially equation-agnostic. Complex systems typically exhibit a hierarchy of temporal behaviors, and unresolved or undesired timescales can obscure the dominant mechanisms driving macroscopic responses. As an element of this desired framework, in the spirit of Markov state modelling, we propose here a comprehensive analysis of the linear and nonlinear response of Markov chains to general time-dependent perturbations. We obtain simple and easily implementable formulas that can be used to predict the response of observables as well as higher-order correlations of the system. The methodology proposed here can be implemented in a purely data-driven setting and even if we do not know the underlying evolution equations. The use of algebraic expansions inspired by Koopmanism allow to elucidate the role of different time scales and find explicit and interpretable expressions for the Green's functions at all orders. This is a major advantage of the framework proposed here. We illustrate our methodology in a very simple yet instructive metastable system. Finally, our results provide a dynamical foundation for the Prony method, which is commonly used for the statistical analysis of discrete time signals.

Title: A universal route from avalanches in mean-field models with random fields to stochastic Poisson branching events
Authors: Jordi Baró, Álvaro Corral
Abstract: Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.

Title: Improved Calculation of Acoustic Deformation Potentials from First Principles
Authors: Patrick Williams, Angela Dyson
Abstract: Using density functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), the band structure, phonon dispersion and electron phonon coupling matrix were calculated for silicon (Si), diamond and cubic boron nitride (cBN). From these, the acoustic deformation potential was calculated for multiple angles between the electron and phonon wave vectors and analytic expressions for the longitudinal and acoustic modes were fit to find an average deformation potential. The ability to calculate the deformation potential from first principles allows for the scattering rates to be determined without the use of lengthy empirical methods. For Si, the numerically calculated deformation potentials are in excellent agreement with what is seen in the literature. On the other hand, the deformation potentials calculated for diamond were found to be larger than what has been seen previously, however previous calculations of transport parameters in diamond report a large range of values for scattering parameters which may be due to assumptions made in each model. Excellent agreement was also seen between the value calculated for cBN and the literature, however there are no experimental results for cBN and so this value is compared against an estimate. This shows that scattering parameters can be calculated via first principles for materials with sparse experimental data, which in turn allows for increased confidence in the output of charge transport simulations of new and emerging materials.

Title: The Saga of $α$-RuCl$_3$: Parameters, Models, and Phase Diagrams
Authors: Marius Möller, P. A. Maksimov, Shengtao Jiang, Steven R. White, Roser Valenti, A. L. Chernyshev
Abstract: RuCl$_3$ was likely the first ever deliberately synthesized ruthenium compound, following the discovery of the $_{44}$Ru element in 1844. For a long time it was known as an oxidation catalyst, with its physical properties being discrepant and confusing, until a decade ago when its allotropic form $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rose to exceptional prominence. This "re-discovery" of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has not only reshaped the hunt for a material manifestation of the Kitaev spin liquid, but it has opened the floodgates of theoretical and experimental research in the many unusual phases and excitations that the anisotropic-exchange magnets as a class of compounds have to offer. Given its importance for the field of Kitaev materials, it is astonishing that the low-energy spin model that describes this compound and its possible proximity to the much-desired spin-liquid state is still a subject of significant debate ten years later. In the present study, we argue that the existing key phenomenological observations put strong natural constraints on the effective microscopic spin model of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and specifically on its spin-orbit-induced anisotropic-exchange parameters that are responsible for the non-trivial physical properties of this material. These constraints allow one to focus on the relevant region of the multi-dimensional phase diagram of the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ model, suggest an intuitive description of it via a different parametrization of the exchange matrix, offer a unifying view on the earlier assessments of its parameters, and bring closer together several approaches to the derivation of anisotropic-exchange models. We explore extended phase diagrams relevant to the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ parameter space using quasi-classical, Luttinger-Tisza, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix renormalization group methods, demonstrating a remarkably c...

Title: Superballistic paradox in electron fluids: Evidence of tomographic transport
Authors: Jorge Estrada-Álvarez, Elena Díaz, Francisco Domínguez-Adame
Abstract: Electron hydrodynamics encompasses the exotic fluid-like behavior of electrons in two-dimensional materials such as graphene. It accounts for superballistic conduction, also known as the Gurzhi effect, where increasing temperature reduces the electrical resistance. In analogy with conventional fluids, the Gurzhi effect is only expected in the hydrodynamic regime, with the decrease in the resistance occurring at intermediate temperatures. Nonetheless, experiments on electron fluids consistently show that superballistic conduction starts at close-to-zero temperatures. To address this paradox, we study hydrodynamic flow, and we find that replacing the classical dynamics with tomographic dynamics, where only head-on collisions are allowed between electrons, solves the dilemma. The latter strengthens superballistic conduction, with potential applications in low-dissipation devices, and explains its differences with the Molenkamp effect and conventional fluids dynamics. Our study reveals that the superballistic paradox is resolved by considering the electrons not as classical particles but as fermions.

Title: Flow-based sampling for multimodal and extended-mode distributions in lattice field theory
Authors: Daniel C. Hackett, Chung-Chun Hsieh, Sahil Pontula, Michael S. Albergo, Denis Boyda, Jiunn-Wei Chen, Kai-Feng Chen, Kyle Cranmer, Gurtej Kanwar, Phiala E. Shanahan
Abstract: Recent results have demonstrated that samplers constructed with flow-based generative models are a promising new approach for configuration generation in lattice field theory. In this paper, we present a set of training- and architecture-based methods to construct flow models for targets with multiple separated modes (i.e.~vacua) as well as targets with extended/continuous modes. We demonstrate the application of these methods to modeling two-dimensional real and complex scalar field theories in their symmetry-broken phases. In this context we investigate different flow-based sampling algorithms, including a composite sampling algorithm where flow-based proposals are occasionally augmented by applying updates using traditional algorithms like HMC.

Title: Bulk-to-boundary anyon fusion from microscopic models
Authors: Julio C. Magdalena de la Fuente, Jens Eisert, Andreas Bauer
Abstract: Topological quantum error correction based on the manipulation of the anyonic defects constitutes one of the most promising frameworks towards realizing fault-tolerant quantum devices. Hence, it is crucial to understand how these defects interact with external defects such as boundaries or domain walls. Motivated by this line of thought, in this work, we study the fusion events between anyons in the bulk and at the boundary in fixed-point models of 2+1-dimensional non-chiral topological order defined by arbitrary fusion categories. Our construction uses generalized tube algebra techniques to construct a bi-representation of bulk and boundary defects. We explicitly derive a formula to calculate the fusion multiplicities of a bulk-to-boundary fusion event for twisted quantum double models and calculate some exemplary fusion events for Abelian models and the (twisted) quantum double model of S3, the simplest non-Abelian group-theoretical model. Moreover, we use the folding trick to study the anyonic behavior at non-trivial domain walls between twisted S3 and twisted Z2 as well as Z3 models. A recurring theme in our construction is an isomorphism relating twisted cohomology groups to untwisted ones. The results of this work can directly be applied to study logical operators in two-dimensional topological error correcting codes with boundaries described by a twisted gauge theory of a finite group.

Title: Quadratic Scaling Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Yotam M. Y. Feldman, Barak Hirshberg
Abstract: Bosonic exchange symmetry leads to fascinating quantum phenomena, from exciton condensation in quantum materials to the superfluidity of liquid Helium-4. Unfortunately, path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations of bosons are computationally prohibitive beyond $\mathord{\sim} 100$ particles, due to a cubic scaling with the system size. We present an algorithm that reduces the complexity from cubic to quadratic, allowing the first simulations of thousands of bosons using PIMD. Our method is orders of magnitude faster, with a speedup that scales linearly with the number of particles and the number of imaginary time slices (beads). Simulations that would have otherwise taken decades can now be done in days. In practice, the new algorithm eliminates most of the added computational cost of including bosonic exchange effects, making them almost as accessible as PIMD simulations of distinguishable particles.

Title: Asymptotic Freedom at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition without Fine-Tuning Using a Qubit Regularization
Authors: Sandip Maiti, Debasish Banerjee, Shailesh Chandrasekharan, Marina K. Marinkovic
Abstract: We propose a two-dimensional hard-core loop-gas model as a way to regularize the asymptotically free massive continuum quantum field theory that emerges at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Without fine-tuning, our model can reproduce the universal step-scaling function of the classical lattice XY model in the massive phase as we approach the phase transition. This is achieved by lowering the fugacity of Fock-vacuum sites in the loop-gas configuration space to zero in the thermodynamic limit. Some of the universal quantities at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition show smaller finite size effects in our model as compared to the traditional XY model. Our model is a prime example of qubit regularization of an asymptotically free massive quantum field theory in Euclidean space-time and helps understand how asymptotic freedom can arise as a relevant perturbation at a decoupled fixed point without fine-tuning.

Title: Online calibration scheme for training restricted Boltzmann machines with quantum annealing
Authors: Takeru Goto, Masayuki Ohzeki
Abstract: We propose a scheme to calibrate the internal parameters of a quantum annealer to obtain well-approximated samples for training a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Empirically, samples from quantum annealers obey the Boltzmann distribution, making them suitable for RBM training. Quantum annealers utilize physical phenomena to generate a large number of samples in a short time. However, hardware imperfections make it challenging to obtain accurate samples. Existing research often estimates the inverse temperature for the compensation. Our scheme efficiently utilizes samples for RBM training also to estimate internal parameters. Furthermore, we consider additional parameters and demonstrate that they improve sample quality. We evaluate our approach by comparing the obtained samples with classical Gibbs sampling, which theoretically generates accurate samples. Our results indicate that our scheme demonstrates performance on par with Gibbs sampling. In addition, the training results with our estimation scheme outperform those of the contrastive divergence algorithm, a standard training algorithm for RBM.

Title: Deep neural networks from the perspective of ergodic theory
Authors: Fan Zhang
Abstract: The design of deep neural networks remains somewhat of an art rather than precise science. By tentatively adopting ergodic theory considerations on top of viewing the network as the time evolution of a dynamical system, with each layer corresponding to a temporal instance, we show that some rules of thumb, which might otherwise appear mysterious, can be attributed heuristics.

Title: Fast and accurate electromagnetic modeling of non-insulated and metal-insulated REBCO magnets
Authors: Enric Pardo, Philippe Fazilleau
Abstract: REBCO high-temperature superconductors are promising for fully superconducting high-field magnets, including ultra-high field magnets. Non-insulated (NI) and metal-insulated (MI) windings are a good solution for protection against electro-thermal quench. Design and optimization requires numerical modelling of REBCO inserts for high-field magnets. Here, we detail a fast and accurate two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional model for the electromagnetic response of NI and MI coils, which is based on the Minimum Electro Magnetic Entropy Production (MEMEP). Benchmarking with an $A-V$ formulation method on a double pancake coil shows good agreement. We also analyse a fully superconducting 32 T magnet with a REBCO insert and a low-temperature superconducing (LTS) outsert. In particular, we analyze the current density, the screening curren induced field (SCIF), and the AC loss. We have shown that metal-insulated coils enable transfer of angular current in the radial direction, and hence magnet protection, while keeping the same screening currents and AC loss of isolated coils, even at relatively high ramp rates of 1 A/s. Surprisingly, soldered coils with low resistance between turns present relatively low AC loss for over-current configuration, which might enable higher generated magnetic fields. The numerical method presented here can be applied to optimize high-field magnets regarding SCIF in MI or NI magnets. It also serves as the basis for future electro-thermal modelling and multi-physics modeling that also includes mechanical properties.

Title: Sampling reduced density matrix to extract fine levels of entanglement spectrum
Authors: Bin-Bin Mao, Yi-Ming Ding, Zheng Yan
Abstract: Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in two or higher dimensions, there unfortunately exists no universal yet practical method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost. Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing controversy. Our simulation results, with unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a huge freedom degree of environment.

Title: Dependence of the critical temperature and disorder in holographic superconductors on superfluid density
Authors: Zhenguo Wang, Xian-Hui Ge, Shuta Ishigaki
Abstract: Recent experiments strongly indicate deep connections between transports of strange metal and high $T_c$ superconductors. For instance, it is known that the dependence of the zero-temperature phase stiffness on the critical superconducting temperature becomes linear in underdoped materials. In this paper, we investigate relation meticulously between the phase stiffness and the critical superconducting temperature for the Gubser-Rocha holographic superconductor model in the probe limit. The superfluid density (or phase stiffness) can be extracted from the low-frequency dependence of the AC conductivity. More importantly, we find linear dependence of zero-temperature superfluid density on the critical superconducting temperature, which has a similarity to a recent experiment in a film cuprate. In addition, we also provide some approximate formulas for the critical temperatures and the AC conductivity.

Title: Nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity magnomechanics exploiting chiral cavity-magnon coupling
Authors: Zhi-Yuan Fan, Xuan Zuo, Hao-Tian Li, Jie Li
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism to achieve nonreciprocal quantum entanglement in a cavity magnomechanical system by exploiting the chiral cavity-magnon coupling. The system consists of a magnon mode, a mechanical vibration mode, and two degenerate counter-propagating microwave cavity modes in a torus-shaped cavity. We show that nonreciprocal stationary microwave-magnon and -phonon bipartite entanglements and photon-magnon-phonon tripartite entanglement can be achieved by respectively driving different circulating cavity modes that hold a chiral coupling to the magnon mode. The nonreciprocal entanglements are shown to be robust against various experimental imperfections. We specifically show how such nonreciprocal entanglement can realize the channel multiplexing quantum teleportation from a microwave field to a solid-state magnon mode. The work may find promising applications of the cavity magnomechanical systems in noise-tolerant quantum processing, channel multiplexing quantum teleportation, and chiral magnonic quantum networks.

Title: Spin coherence in strongly coupled spin baths in quasi-two-dimensional layers
Authors: Philip Schätzle, Reyhaneh Ghassemizadeh, Daniel F. Urban, Thomas Wellens, Peter Knittel, Florentin Reiter, Jan Jeske, Walter Hahn
Abstract: We investigate the spin-coherence decay of NV$^-$-spins interacting with the strongly-coupled bath of nitrogen defects in diamond layers. For thin diamond layers, we demonstrate that the spin-coherence times exceed those of bulk diamond, thus allowing to surpass the limit imposed by high defect concentrations in bulk. We show that the stretched-exponential parameter for the short-time spin-coherence decay is governed by the hyperfine interaction in the bath, thereby constraining random-noise models. We introduce a novel method based on the cluster-correlation expansion applied to strongly-interacting bath partitions. Our results facilitate material development for quantum-technology devices.

Title: Lattice ultrasensitivity amplifies signals in E. coli without fine-tuning
Authors: Derek M. Sherry, Isabella R. Graf, Samuel J. Bryant, Thierry Emonet, Benjamin B. Machta
Abstract: The E. coli chemosensory lattice, consisting of receptors, kinases, and adaptor proteins, is an important test case for biochemical signal processing. Kinase output is characterized by precise adaptation to a wide range of background ligand levels and large gain in response to small relative changes in concentration. Existing models of this lattice achieve their gain through allosteric interactions between either receptors or core units of receptors and kinases. Here we introduce a model which operates through an entirely different mechanism in which receptors gate inherently far from equilibrium enzymatic reactions between neighboring kinases. Our lattice model achieves gain through a mechanism more closely related to zero-order ultrasensitivity than to allostery. Thus, we call it lattice ultrasensitivity (LU). Unlike other lattice critical models, the LU model can achieve arbitrarily high gain through time-scale separation, rather than through fine-tuning. The model also captures qualitative experimental results which are difficult to reconcile with existing models. We discuss possible implementations in the lattice's baseplate where long flexible linkers could potentially mediate interactions between neighboring core units.

Title: Demystifying Spectral Bias on Real-World Data
Authors: Itay Lavie, Zohar Ringel
Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) and Gaussian processes (GPs) are fundamental tools in statistics and machine learning, with recent applications to highly over-parameterized deep neural networks. The ability of these tools to learn a target function is directly related to the eigenvalues of their kernel sampled on the input data distribution. Targets that have support on higher eigenvalues are more learnable. However, solving such eigenvalue problems on real-world data remains a challenge. Here, we consider cross-dataset learnability and show that one may use eigenvalues and eigenfunctions associated with highly idealized data measures to reveal spectral bias on complex datasets and bound learnability on real-world data. This allows us to leverage various symmetries that realistic kernels manifest to unravel their spectral bias.

Title: Boundary Time Crystals as AC sensors: enhancements and constraints
Authors: Dominic Gribben, Anna Sanpera, Rosario Fazio, Jamir Marino, Fernando Iemini
Abstract: We investigate the use of a boundary time crystals (BTCs) as quantum sensors of AC fields. Boundary time crystals are non-equilibrium phases of matter in contact to an environment, for which a macroscopic fraction of the many-body system breaks the time translation symmetry. We find an enhanced sensitivity of the BTC when its spins are resonant with the applied AC field, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The QFI dynamics in this regime is shown to be captured by a relatively simple ansatz consisting of an initial power-law growth and late-time exponential decay. We study the scaling of the ansatz parameters with resources (encoding time and number of spins) and identify a moderate quantum enhancement in the sensor performance through comparison with classical QFI bounds. Investigating the precise source of this performance, we find that despite of its long coherence time and multipartite correlations (advantageous properties for quantum metrology), the entropic cost of the BTC (which grows indefinitely in the thermodynamic limit) hinders an optimal decoding of the AC field information. This result has implications for future candidates of quantum sensors in open system and we hope it will encourage future study into the role of entropy in quantum metrology.

Title: Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality for dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential
Authors: Tsubasa Sakamoto, Ryosuke Yoshii, Shunji Tsuchiya
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as introduced by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of noninvasive measurement. In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.

Title: SymTFT for (3+1)d Gapless SPTs and Obstructions to Confinement
Authors: Andrea Antinucci, Christian Copetti, Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: We study gapless phases in (3+1)d in the presence of 1-form and non-invertible duality symmetries. Using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach, we classify the gapless symmetry-protected (gSPT) phases in these setups, with particular focus on intrinsically gSPTs (igSPTs). These are symmetry protected critical points which cannot be deformed to a trivially gapped phase without spontaneously breaking the symmetry. Although these are by now well-known in (1+1)d, we demonstrate their existence in (3+1)d gauge theories. Here, they have a clear physical interpretation in terms of an obstruction to confinement, even though the full 1-form symmetry does not suffer from 't Hooft anomalies. These igSPT phases provide a new way to realize 1-form symmetries in CFTs, that has no analog for gapped phases. The SymTFT approach allows for a direct generalization from invertible symmetries to non-invertible duality symmetries, for which we study gSPT and igSPT phases as well. We accompany these theoretical results with concrete physical examples realizing such phases and explain how obstruction to confinement is detected at the level of symmetric deformations.

Title: Topological zero modes and bounded modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions and dualities
Authors: Pasquale Marra, Angela Nigro
Abstract: Topology describes global quantities invariant under continuous deformations, such as the number of elementary excitations at a phase boundary, without detailing specifics. Conversely, differential laws are needed to understand the physical properties of these excitations, such as their localization and spatial behavior. For instance, topology mandates the existence of solitonic zero-energy modes at the domain walls between topologically inequivalent phases in topological insulators and superconductors. However, the spatial dependence of these modes is only known in the idealized (and unrealistic) case of a sharp domain wall. Here, we find the analytical solutions of these zero-modes by assuming a smooth and exponentially-confined domain wall. This allows us to characterize the zero-modes using a few length scales: the domain wall width, the exponential decay length, and oscillation wavelength. These quantities define distinct regimes: featureless modes with "no hair" at sharp domain walls, and nonfeatureless modes at smooth domain walls, respectively, with "short hair", i.e., featureless at long distances, and "long hair", i.e., nonfeatureless at all length scales. We thus establish a universal relation between the bulk excitation gap, decay rate, and oscillation momentum of the zero modes, which quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities. Additionally, we reveal an unexpected duality between topological zero modes and Shockley modes, unifying the understanding of topologically-protected and nontopological boundary modes. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of edge modes in topological insulators and Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors and on the differences and similarities between topological and nontopological zero modes in these systems.

Title: Simple Hückel Molecular Orbital Theory for Möbius Carbon Nanobelts
Authors: Yang Wang
Abstract: The recently synthesized Möbius carbon nanobelts (CNBs) have gained attention owing to their unique $\pi$-conjugation topology, which results in distinctive electronic properties with both fundamental and practical implications. Although Möbius conjugation with phase inversion in atomic orbital (AO) basis is well-established for monocyclic systems, the extension of this understanding to double-stranded Möbius CNBs remains uncertain. This study thoroughly examines the simple Hückel molecular orbital (SHMO) theory for describing the $\pi$ electronic structures of Möbius CNBs. We demonstrate that the adjacency matrix for any Möbius CNB can preserve its eigenvalues and eigenvectors (with possibly flipped directions) under different placements of the sign inversion, ensuring identical SHMO results regardless of AO phase inversion location. Representative examples of Möbius CNBs, including the experimentally synthesized one, show that the Hückel molecular orbitals (MOs) strikingly resemble the DFT-computed $\pi$ MOs, which were obtained using a herein proposed technique based on the localization and re-delocalization of DFT canonical MOs. Interestingly, the lower-lying $\pi$ MOs exhibit an odd number of nodal planes and are doubly quasidegenerate as a consequence of the phase inversion in Möbius macrocycles, contrasting with macrocyclic Hückel systems. Coulson bond orders derived from SHMO theory correlate well with DFT-calculated Wiberg bond indices for all C-C bonds in tested Möbius CNBs. Additionally, a remarkable correlation is observed between HOMO-LUMO gaps obtained from the SHMO and GFN2-xTB calculations for a large number of topoisomers of Möbius CNBs. Thus, the SHMO model not only captures the essence of $\pi$ electronic structure of Möbius CNBs, but also provides reliable quantitative predictions comparable to DFT results.

Title: Spectra and pseudospectra in the evaluation of material stability in phase field schemes
Authors: Michele Benzi, Daniele La Pegna, Paolo Maria Mariano
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of bodies with "active" microstructure described by vector-valued phase fields. For waves with time-varying amplitude, the associated evolution equation involves a matrix that can be non-normal, depending on the constitutive choices adopted for the microstructural actions associated with the considered phase field. The occurrence of non-normality requires to look at the pseudospectrum of the considered matrix, namely the set of all possible eigenvalues of matrices in a $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of the matrix itself, because the eigenvalues of non-normal matrices can be very sensitive to small perturbations and therefore the spectral analysis alone would not be sufficient to distinguish with certainty between table and unstable behavior. We develop the relevant analyses in the case of quasicrystals for which the values of some constitutive parameters are not known or are uncertain from an experimental point of view, a circumstance suggesting parametric analyses. We find circumstances in which the pseudospectra obtained by means of the so-called structured perturbations predict instability when, instead, the spectral analysis indicates stability.

Title: Symmetry-protected Landau-Zener-Stückelberg-Majorana interference and non-adiabatic topological transport of edge states
Authors: Shi Hu, Shihao Li, Meiqing Hu, Zhoutao Lei
Abstract: We systematically investigate Landau-Zener-Stückelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interference under chiral-mirror-like symmetry and propose its application to non-adiabatic topological transport of edge states. Protected by this symmetry, complete destructive interference emerges and can be characterized through occupation probability. This symmetry-protected LZSM interference enables state transitions to be achieved within remarkably short time scales. To demonstrate our mechanism, we provide two distinctive two-level systems as examples and survey them in detail. By tuning evolution speed or increasing holding time, the complete destructive interferences are observed. Furthermore, we make use of this mechanism for topological edge states of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain by taking them as an isolated two-level system. Through carefully designed time sequences, we construct symmetry-protected LZSM interference of topological edge states, enabling non-adiabatic topological transport. Our work unveils an alternative way to study quantum control, quantum state transfer, and quantum communication via non-adiabatic topological transport.

Title: Ab-Initio Approach to Many-Body Quantum Spin Dynamics
Authors: Aditya Dubey, Zeki Zeybek, Fabian Köhler, Rick Mukherjee, Peter Schmelcher
Abstract: A fundamental longstanding problem in studying spin models is the efficient and accurate numerical simulation of the long-time behavior of larger systems. The exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the entanglement accumulation at long times pose major challenges for current methods. To address these issues, we employ the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) framework to simulate the many-body spin dynamics of the Heisenberg model in various settings, including the Ising and XYZ limits with different interaction ranges and random couplings. Benchmarks with analytical and exact numerical approaches show that ML-MCTDH accurately captures the time evolution of one- and two-body observables in both one- and two-dimensional lattices. A comparison with the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) highlights that ML-MCTDH is particularly well-suited for handling anisotropic models and provides more reliable results for two-point observables across all tested cases. The behavior of the corresponding entanglement dynamics is analyzed to reveal the complexity of the quantum states. Our findings indicate that the rate of entanglement growth strongly depends on the interaction range and the presence of disorder. This particular relationship is then used to examine the convergence behavior of ML-MCTDH. Our results indicate that the multilayer structure of ML-MCTDH is a promising numerical framework for handling the dynamics of generic many-body spin systems.

Title: Symmetry and causality constraints on Fermi liquids
Authors: Luca V. Delacrétaz, Subham Dutta Chowdhury, Umang Mehta
Abstract: We investigate symmetry and causality constraints on interacting Fermi liquids. Whereas Galilean or Lorentz boost symmetry leads to a well-known constraint on the first Landau parameter $F_1$, we show that scale invariance similarly constrains $F_0$. In the case of conformal Fermi liquids, we show that causality constraints on the particle-hole continuum and on zero sound strongly restrict the available parameter space for interacting Fermi liquids. We also consider nonlinear response, which we show is sensitive to additional ``generalized Landau parameters'' even at lowest orders in the long wavelength limit. We impose Galilean, Lorentz and scale symmetry on these generalized Landau parameters, obtaining further nonlinear constraints. We test our constraints in several microscopic models that enter a Fermi liquid phase.

Title: A study of pendular liquid bridge between two equal solid spheres
Authors: James Q Feng
Abstract: Pendular liquid bridges with concave meridians between two equal rigid spheres are mathematically studied emphasizing some less analyzed facts in the literature. Discrepancies from the numerical solution of the Young-Laplace equation are examined among typical simplifying approximations and a few curve-fitting formulas. The separation distance between spheres is shown to play an important role in pendular ring formation via capillary condensation for a given relative humidity and the strength of subsequent capillary forces. For most practical situations, the toroidal approximation could be reasonably accurate (especially with diminishing separation distance) and provide valuable mathematical insights at least in a qualitative sense with its relatively simple analytical formulas. Using the elliptic meridional profile generally offers more accurate approximations, but with such complicated analytical formulas that it would limit its convenience for practical applications. With a few examples, the present study shows that curve-fitting formulas cannot be perfect and, by their approximative nature, would always leave room for improvements; therefore, care should be taken when applying curve-fitting formulas, to avoid undesirable errors.

Title: Higher Representations and Quark Confinement
Authors: Finn Gagliano, Andrea Grigoletto, Kantaro Ohmori
Abstract: The concept of a (de)confined phase in QFT is well-defined in the presence of $1$-form symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, in scenarios where such symmetries are absent, confinement is not a well-defined phase property. In this work, we propose that, when restricting to a specific submanifold of the parameter space -- namely at zero temperature and fixed quark mass -- the confined and adjoint Higgs phases of scalar QCD can be distinguished through the different organization of their spectra, as seen from the perspective of the baryon symmetry. The analysis is performed in terms of an appropriate higher-categorical representation theory, recently developed for generalized symmetries. Consistent with expectations, we find that the confined phase permits only particles with integer baryon charges, while the Higgs phase is characterized by the coexistence of bare quarks and center vortices, exhibiting a non-trivial Aharonov-Bohm effect between these excitations.

Title: Using Domain Knowledge with Deep Learning to Solve Applied Inverse Problems
Authors: Qinyi Tian, Winston Lindqwister, Manolis Veveakis, Laura E. Dalton
Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved the ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships, such as those encountered in complex material inverse problems. However, the effectiveness of these methods often depends on large datasets, which are not always available. In this study, the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge of mechanical behavior is investigated to evaluate the impact on the predictive performance of the models in data-scarce scenarios. To demonstrate this, stress-strain curves were used to predict key microstructural features of porous materials, and the performance of models trained with and without domain knowledge was compared using five deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Networks, Extreme Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Long Short-Term Memory, and Random Forest. The results of the models with domain-specific characteristics consistently achieved higher $R^2$ values and improved learning efficiency compared to models without prior knowledge. When the models did not include domain knowledge, the model results revealed meaningful patterns were not recognized, while those enhanced with mechanical insights showed superior feature extraction and predictions. These findings underscore the critical role of domain knowledge in guiding deep learning models, highlighting the need to combine domain expertise with data-driven approaches to achieve reliable and accurate outcomes in materials science and related fields.

Title: Periodic Boundary Conditions for Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Jacob Higer, Yotam M. Y. Feldman, Barak Hirshberg
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for bosonic path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that scales quadratically with the number of particles. Path integral methods are a powerful tool to simulate bosonic condensed phases, which exhibit fundamental physical phenomena such as Bose--Einstein condensation and superfluidity. Recently, we developed a quadratic scaling algorithm for bosonic PIMD, but employed an ad hoc treatment of PBC. Here we rigorously enforce PBC in bosonic PIMD. It requires summing over the spring energies of all periodic images in the partition function, and a naive implementation scales exponentially with the system size. We present an algorithm for bosonic PIMD simulations of periodic systems that scales only quadratically. We benchmark our implementation on the free Bose gas and a model system of cold atoms in optical lattices. We also study an approximate treatment of PBC based on the minimum-image convention, and derive a numerical criterion to determine when it is valid.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) with optically read qubits is a key focus of research, as they show high potential for detecting electric and magnetic fields, temperature, and other physico-chemical quantities at the nanoscale, which are highly sought after in chemistry and biology. Proper functionalization of FNDs is required for their application as probes in chemical and biological processes. However, modifying the surface of FNDs can affect the properties of qubit sensors. In this work, we thoroughly study the fundamental properties of embedded nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers as a function of FND size and surface termination. The FNDs were produced by milling high-pressure, high-temperature diamonds, and NV centers were introduced via electron beam irradiation and annealing. In particular, the initial FNDs, covered with various oxygen groups, were homogenized through a reduction process to predominantly cover them with alcohol ($-$OH) groups as reference FNDs. Additionally, a Hofmann degradation process was applied to terminate FNDs with amine ($-$NH$_2$) groups, enabling direct linkage of proteins and other biomolecules to the FNDs. We monitored the charge state stability upon illumination, the zero-field splitting parameters, and the longitudinal spin-relaxation time of the NV centers in these FNDs. Our findings indicate that charge state stabilization of the NV centers was achieved in both $-$OH- and $-$NH$_2$-terminated FNDs beyond a certain FND size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $-$NH$_2$-terminated FNDs embedding NV centers exhibit a $T_1$ longitudinal relaxation time of approximately 25~$\mu$s, independent of FND size within the studied range of 10~nm to 140~nm. This relaxation time is comparable to that of larger-sized reference FNDs.

Title: Scalable Discrete Diffusion Samplers: Combinatorial Optimization and Statistical Physics
Authors: Sebastian Sanokowski, Wilhelm Berghammer, Martin Ennemoser, Haoyu Peter Wang, Sepp Hochreiter, Sebastian Lehner
Abstract: Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.
