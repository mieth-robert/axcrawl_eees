Title: Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Sensor for Perfluorooctanoic Acid Detection Using Two-dimensional Aluminium Quasicrystal
Authors: Anyesha Chakraborty, Raphael Tromer, Thakur Prasad Yadav, Nilay Krishna Mukhopadhyay, Basudev Lahiri, Rahul Rao, Ajit.K.Roy, Nirupam Aich, Cristiano F. Woellner, Douglas S. Galvao, Chandra Sekhar Tiwary
Abstract: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred as "forever chemicals," are pervasive environmental pollutants due to their resistance to degradation. Among these, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) poses significant threats to human health, contaminating water sources globally. Here, we have demonstrated the potential of a novel electrochemical sensor based on two-dimensional (2D) aluminium-based multicomponent quasicrystals (2D-Al QC) for the ultrasensitive sub-picomolar level detection of PFOA. The 2D-Al QC-inked electrode was employed here to detect PFOA by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The limit of detection (LoD) achieved is 0.59 +/- 0.05 pM. The sensor was evaluated for selectivity with other interfering compounds, repeatability of cycles, and reproducibility for five similar electrodes with a deviation of 0.8 %. The stability of the sensor has also been analysed after ninety days ,which shows a minimal variation of 15%. Spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations were further utilized to understand the interaction between the 2D-Al QC and PFOA. The results demonstrate that the 2D-Al QC offers a promising platform for the rapid and sensitive detection of PFOA, potentially addressing current environmental monitoring challenges.

Title: Three-dimensional (3D) tensor-based methodology for characterizing 3D anisotropic thermal conductivity tensor
Authors: Dihui Wang, Heng Ban, Puqing Jiang
Abstract: The increasing complexity of advanced materials with anisotropic thermal properties necessitates more generic and efficient methods to determine three-dimensional (3D) anisotropic thermal conductivity tensors with up to six independent components. Current methods rely on a vector-based framework that can handle only up to four independent components, often leading to inefficiencies and inaccuracies. We introduce Three-Dimensional Spatially Resolved Lock-In Micro-Thermography (3D SR-LIT), a novel optical thermal characterization technique combining a 3D tensor-based framework with an efficient area-detection experimental system. For simple tensors (e.g., x-cut quartz, k_xz=k_yz=0), our method reduces uncertainty by over 50% compared to vector-based methods. For complex tensors with six independent components (e.g., AT-cut quartz), 2{\sigma} uncertainties remain below 12% for all components. A novel adaptive mapping approach enables high-throughput data acquisition (40 seconds to 3 minutes, depending on tensor complexity), over 35 times faster than current methods, and accommodates samples with 200 nm surface roughness. Extensive numerical validation on 1,000 arbitrary anisotropic tensors ranging from 1 to 1,000 Wm^(-1) K^(-1) further validates the robustness of this methodology. This work highlights significant advancements in thermal characterization of complex anisotropic materials.

Title: Problem hardness of diluted Ising models: Population Annealing vs Simulated Annealing
Authors: Fernando Martínez-García, Diego Porras
Abstract: Population annealing is a variant of the simulated annealing algorithm that improves the quality of the thermalization process in systems with rough free-energy landscapes by introducing a resampling process. We consider the diluted Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising model using population annealing to study its efficiency in finding solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. From this study, we find an easy-hard-easy transition in the model hardness as the problem instances become more diluted, and associate this behaviour to the clusterization and connectivity of the underlying Erdős-Rényi graphs. We calculate the efficiency of obtaining minimum energy configurations and find that population annealing outperforms simulated annealing for the cases close to this hardness peak while reaching similar efficiencies in the easy limits. Finally, it is known that population annealing can be used to define an adaptive inverse temperature annealing schedule. We compare this adaptive method to a linear schedule and find that the adaptive method achieves improved efficiencies while being robust against final temperature miscalibrations.

Title: Elastic Interaction of Pressurized Cavities in Hyperelastic Media: Attraction and Repulsion
Authors: Ali Saeedi, Mrityunjay Kothari
Abstract: This study computationally investigates the elastic interaction of two pressurized cylindrical cavities in a 2D hyperelastic medium. Unlike linear elasticity, where interactions are exclusively attractive, nonlinear material models (neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, Arruda-Boyce) exhibit both attraction and repulsion between the cavities. A critical pressure-shear modulus ratio governs the transition, offering a pathway to manipulate cavity configurations through material and loading parameters. At low ratios, the interactions are always attractive; at higher ratios, both attractive and repulsive regimes exist depending on the separation between the cavities. Effect of strain stiffening on these interactions are also analyzed. These insights bridge theoretical and applied mechanics, with implications for soft material design and subsurface engineering.

Title: Charge to spin conversion in atomically thin bismuth
Authors: Wilson J. Yánez-Parreño, Alexander Vera, Sandra Santhosh, Chengye Dong, Jimmy C. Kotsakidis, Yongxi Ou, Saurav Islam, Adam L. Friedman, Maxwell Wetherington, Joshua Robinson, Nitin Samarth
Abstract: We report charge to spin conversion in a hybrid heterostructure comprised of atomically thin bismuth (Bi) confined between a silicon carbide (SiC) substrate and epitaxial graphene (EG). We confirm composition, dimensionality, and a 96.5 \% intercalation coverage using X-ray photolectron spectroscopy, scanning transmission microscopy, low energy electron diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. Electrical transport measurements show signs of weak antilocalization in the heterostructure, consistent with spin-orbit coupling in this hybrid heterostructure. Spin torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements in permalloy/EG/2D-Bi heterostructures probe charge-to-spin conversion and revealing that an in plane polarization of the spin current, perpendicular to the charge current. The ratio of the in-plane to out-of-plane torque is 3.75 times higher than in hydrogenated graphene control samples.

Title: Rare Events and Single Big Jump Effects in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes
Authors: Alberto Bassanoni, Alessandro Vezzani, Eli Barkai, Raffaella Burioni
Abstract: Even in a simple stochastic process, the study of the full distribution of time integrated observables can be a difficult task. This is the case of a much-studied process such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process where, recently, anomalous dynamical scaling of large deviations of time integrated functionals has been highlighted. Using the mapping of a continuous stochastic process to a continuous time random walk via the "excursions technique'', we introduce a comprehensive formalism that enables the calculation of the complete distribution of the time-integrated observable $A = \int_0^T v^n(t) dt$, where $n$ is a positive integer and $v(t)$ is the random velocity of a particle following Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics. We reveal an interesting connection between the anomalous rate function associated with the observable $A$ and the statistics of the area under the first-passage functional during an excursion. The rate function of the latter, analyzed here for the first time, exhibits anomalous scaling behavior and a dynamical phase transition, both of which are explored in detail. The case of the anomalous scaling of large deviations, originally associated to the presence of an instantonic solution in the weak noise regime of a path integral approach, is here produced by a so called "big jump effect'', in which the contribution to rare events is dominated by the largest excursion. Our approach, which is quite general for continuous stochastic processes, allows to associate a physical meaning to the anomalous scaling of large deviations, through the big jump principle.

Title: Quantum anomalous Hall effect for metrology
Authors: Nathaniel J. Huáng, Jessica L. Boland, Kajetan M. Fijalkowski, Charles Gould, Thorsten Hesjedal, Olga Kazakova, Susmit Kumar, Hansjörg Scherer
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in magnetic topological insulators offers great potential to revolutionize quantum electrical metrology by establishing primary resistance standards operating at zero external magnetic field and realizing a universal "quantum electrical metrology toolbox" that can perform quantum resistance, voltage and current metrology in a single instrument. To realize such promise, significant progress is still required to address materials and metrological challenges -- among which, one main challenge is to make the bulk of the topological insulator sufficiently insulating to improve the robustness of resistance quantization. In this Perspective, we present an overview of the QAHE; discuss the aspects of topological material growth and characterization; and present a path towards an QAHE resistance standard realized in magnetically doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ systems. We also present guidelines and methodologies for QAHE resistance metrology, its main limitations and challenges as well as modern strategies to overcome them.

Title: Electrical Control of the Exchange Bias Effect at Ferromagnet-Altermagnet Junctions
Authors: Gaspar De la Barrera, Alvaro S. Nunez
Abstract: This work analyzes the behavior of the interface between a ferromagnetic material and an alter-magnet. We use a well-established line of arguments based on electronic mean-field calculations to show that new surface phenomena that lead to altermagnetic materials induce an exchange bias effect on the nearby ferromagnet. We reveal the physical mechanisms behind this phenomenon that lead to quantitative control over its strength. Interestingly, we predict exotic electric-field-induced phenomena. This is an analogy to the relationship between exchange bias and the injection of spin currents in spin-transfer-dominated scenarios, which has been reported earlier in the traditional antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic junction.

Title: Ensemble inequivalence in the design of mixtures with super-Gibbs phase coexistence
Authors: Filipe C. Thewes, Peter Sollich
Abstract: Designing the phase behavior of multicomponent mixtures is a rich area with many potential applications. One key question is how more than $M+1$ phases, as would normally be allowed by Gibbs' phase rule at generic temperature in a mixture of $M$ molecular species, can be made to coexist in equilibrium. In the grandcanonical ensemble, such super-Gibbs phase equilibria can be realized by tuning the interactions among the $M$ species. This introduces $\sim M^2$ additional degrees of freedom and hence a superlinear number of phases that can coexist. We show that, surprisingly, there is no straightforward equivalence to the situation in the experimentally relevant canonical ensemble: here only a subset of the grandcanonical phases will generically be realized. This subset is determined by interfacial tensions in addition to bulk free energies. Using a graph-theoretical approach, we determine a sufficient set of inequalities for the interfacial tensions for which all grandcanonical phases are realized so that equivalence of ensembles is effectively restored. We illustrate the design method for a two-component mixture with four coexisting phases and point out the route for generalizing this to a higher number of components.

Title: Optimal Control of an Electromechanical Energy Harvester
Authors: Dario Lucente, Alessandro Manacorda, Andrea Plati, Alessandro Sarracino, Marco Baldovin
Abstract: Many techniques originally developed in the context of deterministic control theory have been recently applied to the quest for optimal protocols in stochastic processes. Given a system subject to environmental fluctuations, one may ask what is the best way to change in time its controllable parameters in order to maximize, on average, a certain reward function, while steering the system between two pre-assigned states. In this work we study the problem of optimal control for a wide class of stochastic systems, inspired by a model of energy harvester. The stochastic noise in this system is due to the mechanical vibrations, while the reward function is the average power extracted from them. We consider the case in which the electrical resistance of the harvester can be changed in time, and we exploit the tools of control theory to work out optimal solutions in a perturbative regime, close to the stationary state. Our results show that it is possible to design protocols that perform better than any possible solution with constant resistance.

Title: Rigorous bound on diffusion for chaotic spin chains
Authors: Dimitrios Ampelogiannis, Benjamin Doyon
Abstract: The emergence of diffusion is one of the deepest physical phenomena observed in many-body interacting, chaotic systems. But establishing rigorously that correlation functions, say of the energy density, expand diffusively, remains one of the most important problems of mathematical physics. We show for the first time that diffusion is non-zero in almost every chaotic nearest-neighbor interacting quantum spin chain (spin-1/2, without magnetic field), at high enough temperatures. A chaotic system is defined in the precise sense that the Hilbert space of extensive charges is one-dimensional. Thus, under the widely expected assumption that almost every nearest-neighbor spin chain is indeed chaotic, we find that almost every nearest-neighbor spin chain has non-zero diffusion. Our main tool is the Green-Kubo formula for diffusivity, the mathematical technique of projection over quadratically extensive charges, and appropriate correlation decay bounds recently established. Our methods can be extended to finite or short ranges, magnetic field and higher spins. As we argue, according to the theory of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics, we further expect almost every nearest-neighbor interacting quantum spin chain to display superdiffusion, and thus have infinite diffusivity; however this is still beyond the reach of mathematical rigour.

Title: Band Structure Modeling of Perovskite Materials with Quantum ESPRESSO for Multijunction Photovoltaic Cell Optimization
Authors: Sutharsika Kumar Kalaiselvi
Abstract: Increasing photovoltaic conversion efficiency, or PCE, has proven to be a critical factor in the transition to renewable energy. There exist strong interdependencies between the perovskite crystals and multijunction architectures within photovoltaic cell research. In present literature, there is a lack of intersection in investigating crystallographic geometry and compositional engineering with representation of computational modeling systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the rapid discovery of high-efficiency perovskite-based multijunction cells, specifically with silicon as the low band gap absorbing semiconductor material. We model the spatial geometries of potential perovskite candidates for high-efficiency cells using the Schrodinger Material Science Maestro, optimizing the periodic boundary conditions on the unit cell to minimize edge-bound errors. Band structure calculations using density functional theory become effective to approximate the PCE. After careful adjustments to the ibrav lattice parameter and parallelization, Quantum ESPRESSO was optimized for perovskite multijunction band structure calculations. Computational results on the six test-perovskite configurations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed representation and method, with a calculated efficiency of about 46% for one of the modeled perovskites, placing it at the top of high-efficiency perovskite-Si multijunction cells. With this method, the potential exists to bring forth a new generation of photovoltaic cells that are easily manufacturable, highly efficient, and economical.

Title: TeNeS-v2: Enhancement for Real-Time and Finite Temperature Simulations of Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Yuichi Motoyama, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Kazuyoshi Yoshimi, Satoshi Morita, Tatsumi Aoyama, Takeo Kato, Naoki Kawashima
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems are challenging targets for computational physics due to their large degrees of freedom. The tensor networks, particularly Tensor Product States (TPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), effectively represent these systems on two-dimensional lattices. However, the technical complexity of TPS/PEPS-based coding is often too much for researchers to handle. To reduce this problem, we developed TeNeS (Tensor Network Solver). This paper introduces TeNeS-v2, which extends TeNeS with real-time and finite temperature simulations, providing deeper insights into quantum many-body systems. We detail the new algorithms, input/output design, and application examples, demonstrating TeNeS-v2's applicability to various quantum spin and Bose models on two-dimensional lattices.

Title: Thermal Annealing and Radiation Effects on Structural and Electrical Properties of NbN/GaN Superconductor/Semiconductor Junctions
Authors: Stephen Margiotta, Binzhi Liu, Saleh Ahmed Khan, Gabriel Calderon Ortiz, Ahmed Ibreljic, Jinwoo Hwang, A F M Anhar Uddin Bhuiyan
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, niobium nitride (NbN) superconductors have emerged as integral components due to their unique structural properties, including a high superconducting transition temperature (Tc), exceptional electrical conductivity, and compatibility with advanced device architectures. This study investigates the impact of high-temperature annealing and high-dose gamma irradiation on the structural and superconducting properties of NbN films grown on GaN via reactive DC magnetron sputtering. The as-deposited cubic {\delta}-NbN (111) films exhibited a high-intensity XRD peak, high Tc of 12.82K, and an atomically flat surface. Annealing at 500 and 950 °C for varying durations revealed notable structural and surface changes. High-resolution STEM indicated improved local ordering, while AFM showed reduced surface roughness after annealing. XPS revealed a gradual increase in the Nb/N ratio with higher annealing temperatures and durations. High-resolution XRD and STEM analyses showed lattice constant modifications in {\delta}-NbN films, attributed to residual stress changes following annealing. Additionally, XRD phi-scans revealed sixfold symmetry in NbN films due to rotational domains relative to GaN. While Tc remained stable after annealing at 500 °C, increasing the annealing temperature to 950 °C degraded Tc to ~8K and reduced the residual resistivity ratio from 0.85 in as-deposited films to 0.29 after 30 minutes. The effects of gamma radiation (5 Mrad (Si)) were also studied, demonstrating minimal changes to crystallinity and superconducting performance, indicating excellent radiation resilience. These findings highlight the potential of NbN superconductors for integration into advanced quantum devices and their suitability for applications in radiation-intensive environments such as space, satellites, and nuclear power plants.

Title: Sub-critical athermal flow in disordered materials caused by periodic variations of environmental conditions
Authors: Ezequiel E. Ferrero, Eduardo A. Jagla
Abstract: Yield stress materials deform irreversibly at a finite strain-rate if loaded with a fixed stress $\sigma$ larger than some critical yield stress $\sigma_c$. When $\sigma<\sigma_c$ deformation is only transient, unless thermal activation plays a role, in which case persistent deformation occurs as a creep activated process. Yet in subcritical athermal conditions we observe that cyclic time variation of system parameters can induce a steady-state flow, with a total deformation that scales linearly with the number of cycles applied. We characterize this phenomenon using well established models in the fields of depinning and yielding transitions. Interestingly, there is an endurance limit $\sigma_0<\sigma_c$ for this process to occur, below which the advance is totally suppressed. We discuss implications of our findings to the study of sub-critical evolution of landforms in which periodic variations of external conditions (as for instance daily/seasonal cycles of temperature, humidity, etc.) are expected.

Title: DSMC: A Statistical Mechanics Perspective
Authors: Alejandro L. Garcia
Abstract: This paper presents a perspective in which Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) is viewed not in its traditional role as an algorithm for solving the Boltzmann equation but as a numerical method for statistical mechanics. First, analytical techniques such as the collision virial and Green-Kubo relations, commonly used in molecular dynamics, are used to study the numerical properties of the DSMC algorithm. The stochastic aspect of DSMC, which is often viewed as unwanted numerical noise, is shown to be a useful feature for problems in statistical physics, such as Brownian motion and thermodynamic fluctuations. Finally, it is argued that fundamental results from statistical mechanics can provide guardrails when applying machine learning to DSMC.

Title: Simulations of Three-dimensional Nematic Guidance of Microswimmers
Authors: Zeyang Mou, Yuan Li, Zhihong You, Rui Zhang
Abstract: It has been shown that an anisotropic liquid crystalline (LC) environment can be used to guide the self-propulsion dynamics of dispersed microswimmers, such as bacteria. This type of composite system is named "living nematic" (LN). In the dilute limit, bacteria are found to mainly follow the local director field. Beyond the dilute limit, however, they exhibit novel dynamical behaviors, from swirling around a spiral +1 defect pattern to forming undulating waves, and to active turbulence. Our current knowledge of how these different behaviors emerge at different population densities remains limited. Here we develop a hybrid method to simulate the dynamics of microswimmers dispersed in a nematic LC. Specifically, we model the microswimmers using active Brownian dynamics method, which is coupled to a hydrodynamic model of nematic LCs to describe the evolution of the flow field and the LC structure. Our method is validated by comparing to existing quasi-two-dimensional (2D) experiments, including undulated swirling around a spiral pattern and stabilized undulated jets on a periodic C-pattern. We further extend our method to three-dimensional (3D) systems by examining loop-defect dynamics. We find that the morphodynamics and destiny of a loop defect not only depend on the activity (self-propulsion velocity), effective size, and the initial distribution of the swimmers, but also rely on its winding profile. Specifically, +1/2 wedge and radial twist winding can dictate the dynamics of loop defects. By varying the characteristic reversal time, we predict that microswimmers not necessarily accumulate in splay regions. Taken together, our hybrid method provides a faithful tool to explain and guide the experiments of LNs in both 2D and 3D, sheds light on the interplay between microswimmer distribution and defect dynamics, and unravels the design principles of using LCs to control active matter.

Title: Origin of dimensional crossover in quasi-one-dimensional hollandite K$_{2}$Ru$_{8}$O$_{16}$
Authors: Asif Ali, Sakshi Bansal, B. H. Reddy, Ravi Shankar Singh
Abstract: Intriguing phenomenon of dimensional crossover is comprehensively studied by experimental and theoretical investigation of electronic structure in quasi-one-dimensional hollandite K$_{2}$Ru$_{8}$O$_{16}$. Valence band photoemission spectra in conjunction with density functional theory within local density approximation combined with dynamical mean field theory (LDA+DMFT) reveal moderately correlated electronic structure. Anomalous temperature dependence of high-resolution spectra in the vicinity of Fermi level suggests Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state down to 150 K, below which it undergoes a dimensional crossover from one-dimensional to three-dimensional electronic behaviour. Monotonously decreasing spectral intensity at the Fermi level along with Fermi cut-off at low temperature suggests non-Fermi liquid like behaviour. Many body effects captured within LDA+DMFT reveal increased warping of the Fermi surface with lowering temperature. A simple analysis suggests that the warping dominates the thermal energy induced momentum broadening at low temperature, leading to the 3D electronic behaviour. Our results offer valuable insight in understanding the interplay of dimensionality, electron correlation and thermal energy governing various exotic phenomena in quasi-one-dimensional systems.

Title: Robust triple-q magnetic order with trainable spin vorticity in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$
Authors: Xianghong Jin, Mengqiao Geng, Fabio Orlandi, Dmitry Khalyavin, Pascal Manuel, Yang Liu, Yuan Li
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the candidate Kitaev magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ possesses novel triple-$\mathbf{q}$ magnetic order instead of conventional single-$\mathbf{q}$ zigzag order. Here we present dedicated experiments in search for distinct properties expected of the triple-$\mathbf{q}$ order, namely, insensitivity of the magnetic domains to weak $C_3$ symmetry-breaking fields and fictitious magnetic fields generated by the spin vorticity. In structurally pristine single crystals, we show that $C_3$ symmetry-breaking in-plane uniaxial strains do not affect the order's magnetic neutron diffraction signals. We further show that $\mathbf{c}$-axis propagating light exhibits large Faraday rotations in the ordered state due to the spin vorticity, the sign of which can be trained via the system's ferrimagnetic moment. These results are in favor of the triple-$\mathbf{q}$ order in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ and reveal its unique emerging behavior.

Title: Multifractal-enriched mobility edges and emergent quantum phases in one-dimensional exactly solvable lattice models
Authors: Shan-Zhong Li, Yi-Cai Zhang, Yucheng Wang, Shanchao Zhang, Shi-Liang Zhu, Zhi Li
Abstract: We propose a class of exactly solvable flat-band quasiperiodic lattice models that encompass a variety of multifractal-enriched mobility edges and multi-state coexisting quantum phases. Utilizing Avila's global theory, we derive exact expressions of the Lyapunov exponents in both lattice and dual spaces, providing an analytical expression and phase diagram for the multifractal-enriched mobility edges. Additionally, we numerically compute the inverse participation ratios of the eigenstates in both real and dual spaces to further characterize these phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models can be realized using Rydberg atomic arrays, enabling the observation of Lyapunov exponents and inverse participation ratios through a powerful spectroscopy approach.

Title: Heterarchical Granular Dynamics
Authors: Benjy Marks, Shivakumar Athani, Itai Einav
Abstract: The two most commonly used methods to model the behaviour of granular flows are discrete element and continuum mechanics simulations. These approaches concentrate on the deterministic description of particle or bulk material motion. Unlike these approaches, this paper introduces an alternative model that describes the stochastic dynamics of the void spaces under the action of gravity. The model includes several key phenomena which are observed in deforming granular media, such as segregation, mixing, and an angle of repose. These mechanisms are modelled heterarchically using both spatial and microstructural internal coordinates. Key aspects of the model include its ability to describe both stable and flowing states of granular media based on a solid fraction cut-off, and the influence of particle size on flow, segregation, and mixing. The model is validated with simulations of column collapse and silo discharge.

Title: Disorder-Induced Slow Relaxation of Phonon Polarization
Authors: Yuta Suzuki, Shuichi Murakami
Abstract: The role of the polarization degree of freedom in lattice dynamics in solids has been underlined recently. We theoretically discover a relaxation mechanism for both linear and circular polarizations of acoustic phonons. In the absence of scattering, the polarization exhibits oscillatory behavior. This behavior leads to a counterintuitive result: unlike linear momentum, more frequent scattering events cause slower polarization relaxation due to motional narrowing. We validate this mechanism using the quantum kinetic equation. We derive the relaxation rates of polarizations analytically for isotropic elastic bodies and numerically for a cubic crystal. Remarkably, we reveal that linear polarizations relax more slowly than circular ones. Our findings provide a pathway to extend the lifetime of phonon angular momentum.

Title: Structural and Physical Properties of the Heavy Fermion Metal Ce$_2$NiAl$_6$Si$_5$
Authors: Jiawen Zhang, Jinyu Wu, Ye Chen, Rui Li, Michael Smidman, Yu Liu, Yu Song, Huiqiu Yuan
Abstract: Strongly correlated electrons at the verge of quantum criticality give rise to unconventional phases of matter and behaviors, with the discovery of new quantum critical materials driving synergistic advances in both experiments and theory. In this work, we report the structural and physical properties of a new quaternary Ce-based heavy fermion compound, Ce$_2$NiAl$_6$Si$_5$, synthesized using the self-flux method. This compound forms a layered tetragonal structure (space group $P4/nmm$), with square nets of Ce atoms separated by Si-Al or Ni-Si-Ge layers. Specific heat measurements show a low temperature Sommerfeld coefficient of 1.4 J/mol-Ce K$^{2}$, with a reduced entropy indicative of significant Kondo interactions. Below 0.6 K, an upturn in resistivity and a deviation in magnetic susceptibility suggest the appearance of magnetic ordering or the development of dynamic magnetic correlations, which is further supported by a bulge in specific heat around 0.4 K. These results suggest that Ce$_2$NiAl$_6$Si$_5$ is a layered heavy fermion metal, naturally located in proximity to a spin-density-wave quantum critical point.

Title: Magnetic Interactions in the Polar Ferrimagnet with a Bipartite Structure
Authors: Junbo Liao, Zhentao Huang, Bo Zhang, Yanyan Shangguan, Shufan Cheng, Hao Xu, Zihang Song, Shuai Dong, Devashibhai Adrojia, Song Bao, Jinsheng Wen
Abstract: The polar magnets A$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ (A=Fe, Mn, Co, and Ni) feature a bipartite structure, where the magnetic A$^{2+}$ ions occupy two different sites with octahedral and tetrahedral oxygen coordinations. This bipartite structure provides a platform for the emergence of nontrivial magnetoelectric (ME) effects and intriguing excitation behaviors, and thus creates significant research interest. In this study, we conduct inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystals of Mn$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$, an L-type ferrimagnet in the A$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ family, to investigate its spin dynamics. The obtained magnetic excitation spectra reveal two distinct magnon dispersions corresponding to the octahedral and tetrahedral spins in Mn$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$. These magnon bands can be well described by a spin Hamiltonian including Heisenberg and single-ion anisotropy terms. Employing our effective spin model, we successfully reproduce the unusual temperature dependence of the L-type ferrimagnetic susceptibility through self-consistent mean-field theory. This research reveals the significance of the bipartite structure in determining the excitation properties of the polar magnets $\rm{A_{2}Mo_{3}O_{8}}$ and provides valuable insights into the spin dynamics of L-type ferrimagnets.

Title: Excitonic oscillator-strength saturation dominates polariton-polariton interactions
Authors: Maxime Richard, Irénée Frérot, Sylvain Ravets, Jacqueline Bloch, Carlos Anton-Solanas, Ferdinand Claude, Yueguang Zhou, Martina Morassi, Aristide Lemaître, Iacopo Carusotto, and Anna Minguzzi
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities exhibit large two-body interactions that, thanks to ever refined nanotechnology techniques, are getting closer and closer to the quantum regime where single-photon nonlinearities start being relevant. To foster additional progress in this direction, in this work we experimentally investigate the microscopic mechanism driving polariton-polariton interactions. We measure the dispersion relation of the collective excitations that are thermally generated on top of a coherent fluid of interacting lower-polaritons. By comparing the measurements with the Bogoliubov theory over both the lower and upper polariton branches simultaneously, we find that polariton-polariton interactions stem dominantly from a mechanism of saturation of the exciton oscillator strength.

Title: Mean-squared Energy Difference for Exploring Potential Energy Landscapes of Supercooled Liquids
Authors: Dianmo Zhang, Deyan Sun, Xingao Gong
Abstract: By extending the concept of diffusion to the potential energy landscapes (PELs), we introduce the mean-squared energy difference (MSED) as a novel quantity to investigate the intrinsic properties of glass. MSED can provide a clear description of the "energy relaxation" process on a PEL. Through MSED analysis, we can obtain characteristic timescale similar to those from structure analysis, namely $\tau_\alpha^*$. We establish a connection between MSED and the properties of PELs, providing a concise and quantitative description of the PEL. We find that the roughness of the accessible PEL has changed significantly after the glass transition. And we also find that one of the PEL parameters is closely related to the Adam-Gibbs configurational entropy. The present research, which directly links the PEL to the relaxation process, provides avenues for further research of the glass.

Title: Magnon-induced scalar spin chirality in Kagome and honeycomb ferromagnets
Authors: Nanse Esaki, Gyungchoon Go, Se Kwon Kim
Abstract: The scalar spin chirality (SSC), defined as a triple product of spins, is essential for describing noncoplanar spin structures and understanding chiral physics in magnetic systems. Traditionally, SSC has been discussed primarily in the context of noncoplanar ground-state spin configurations at zero temperature, as collinear spin systems are generally thought to lack SSC. Consequently, whether the SSC can emerge at finite temperatures in spin systems with collinear ground states remains an open question and has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate that thermally excited magnons can induce SSC even in collinear spin systems. By considering 2D ferromagnets on Kagome and honeycomb lattices, we demonstrate that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) which break the effective time-reversal symmetry in the magnon Hamiltonian can lead to finite SSC at finite temperatures. Using a simple spin model, we show both numerically and analytically that the SSC increases with the magnitude of DMI and temperature. Furthermore, calculations based on realistic material parameters reveal that the magnon-induced SSC can achieve a magnitude comparable to those observed in non-coplanar spin configurations. These findings suggest that SSC plays a significant role even in collinear spin systems, providing new insights into the chiral physics of magnetic materials.

Title: Effect of helium surface fluctuations on the Rydberg transition of trapped electrons
Authors: Mikhail Belianchikov, Natalia Morais, Denis Konstantinov
Abstract: Electrons trapped on the surface of liquid helium is an extremely clean system which holds promise for a scalable qubit platform. However, the superfluid surface is not free from fluctuations which might cause the decay and dephasing of the electrons quantized states. Understanding and mitigating these fluctuations is essential for the advancement of electrons-on-helium (eHe) qubit technology. Some work has been recently done to investigate surface oscillations due to the mechanical vibration of the cryostat using a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator. In the present work, we focus on a sub-hertz frequency range and observe a strong effect of surface oscillations on the temporal dynamics of the Rydberg transition of electrons confined in a microchannel trapping device. We suggest possible origin of such oscillations and find a reasonable agreement between the corresponding estimation of the oscillation frequency and the observed result.

Title: Some observations on the ambivalent role of symmetries in Bayesian inference problems

Abstract: We collect in this note some observations on the role of symmetries in Bayesian inference problems, that can be useful or detrimental depending on the way they act on the signal and on the observations. We emphasize in particular the need to gauge away unobservable invariances in the definition of a distance between a signal and its estimator, and the consequences this implies for the statistical mechanics treatment of such models, taking as a motivating example the extensive rank matrix factorization problem.

Title: Exploring the energy spectrum of a four-terminal Josephson junction: Towards topological Andreev band structures

Abstract: Hybrid multiterminal Josephson junctions (JJs) are expected to harbor a novel class of Andreev bound states (ABSs), including topologically nontrivial states in four-terminal devices. In these systems, topological phases emerge when ABSs depend on at least three superconducting phase differences, resulting in a three-dimensional (3D) energy spectrum characterized by Weyl nodes at zero energy. Here, we realize a four-terminal JJ in a hybrid Al/InAs heterostructure, where ABSs form a synthetic 3D band structure. We probe the energy spectrum using tunneling spectroscopy and identify spectral features associated with the formation of a tri-Andreev molecule, a bound state whose energy depends on three superconducting phases and, therefore, is able to host topological ABSs. The experimental observations are well described by a numerical model. The calculations predict the appearance of four Weyl nodes at zero energy within a gap smaller than the experimental resolution. These topological states are theoretically predicted to remain stable within an extended region of the parameter space, well accessible by our device. These findings establish an experimental foundation to study high-dimensional synthetic band structures in multiterminal JJs, and to realize topological Andreev bands.

Title: Quasiparticle Fermi surfaces of niobium and niobium-titanium alloys at high pressure
Authors: D. Jones, A. Östlin, A. Chmeruk, F. Beiuşeanu, U. Eckern, L. Vitos, L. Chioncel
Abstract: The electronic structure of pure niobium and the niobium-titanium alloy Nb$_{0.44}$Ti$_{0.56}$ in the bcc-phase at pressures up to $250$ GPa is investigated, to reveal possible factors conducing toward the robust superconductivity reported for Ti-doped niobium upon a considerable volume reduction. We model the structural disorder using the coherent potential approximation, and the electronic correlations are taken into account using dynamical mean-field theory. At high pressure, a significant change in the topology of the Fermi surface is observed, while electronic correlations weaken with increasing pressure. Thus, the normal state of Nb$_{0.44}$Ti$_{0.56}$ is found to be a Fermi liquid with a well-defined Fermi surface, and well-defined quasiparticles near it. The systematic study of the impact of disorder upon the Fermi surface at such ultra high pressures allows notable insights into the nature of the electronic states near the Fermi level, i.e., within the energy scale relevant for superconducting pairing. Furthermore, our results clearly indicate the necessity of further experimental Fermi surface explorations.

Title: Superconductivity and normal-state transport in compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ thin films
Authors: Yidi Liu, Eun Kyo Ko, Yaoju Tarn, Lopa Bhatt, Berit H. Goodge, David A. Muller, Srinivas Raghu, Yijun Yu, Harold Y. Hwang
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity under high pressure in Ruddlesden-Popper phases of bulk nickelates has sparked great interest in stabilizing ambient pressure superconductivity in thin-film form using epitaxial strain. Recently, signs of superconductivity have been observed in compressively strained bilayer nickelate thin films with an onset temperature exceeding 40 K, albeit with broad and two-step-like transitions. Here, we report intrinsic superconductivity and normal-state transport properties in compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ thin films, achieved through a combination of isovalent Pr substitution, growth optimization, and precision ozone annealing. The superconducting onset occurs above 48 K, with zero resistance reached above 30 K, and the critical current density at 1.4 K is 100-fold larger than previous reports. The normal-state resistivity exhibits quadratic temperature dependence indicative of Fermi liquid behaviour, and other phenomenological similarities to transport in overdoped cuprates suggest parallels in their emergent properties.

Title: Enhancing Spin Diffusion in GaAs Quantum Wells: The Role of Electron Density and Channel Width
Authors: B. W. Grobecker, A. V. Poshakinskiy, S. Anghel, T. Mano, G. Yusa, M. Betz
Abstract: This study explores the relationship between spin diffusion, spin lifetime, electron density and lateral spatial confinement in two-dimensional electron gases hosted in GaAs quantum wells. Using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy, we analyze how Hall-bar channel width and back-gate voltage modulation influence spin dynamics. The results reveal that the spin diffusion coefficient increases with reduced channel widths, a trend further amplified at lower electron concentrations achieved via back-gate voltages, where it increases up to 150% for the narrowest channels. The developed theoretical model confirms the spatial inhomogeneities in the spin diffusion as arising from electron-density variations within the channels. The results underscore the importance of tuning electron density and spatial geometry to optimize spin transport and coherence, providing valuable design considerations for spintronic devices where efficient spin manipulation is crucial.

Title: A rational framework to estimate the chiroptical activity of [6]Helicene Derivatives
Authors: Mirko Vanzan, Susanna Bertuletti, Belen Bazan, Minze T. Rispens, Steven I. C. Wan, Michel Leeman, Willem L. Noorduin, Francesca Baletto
Abstract: Helicenes are a class of molecules potentially suitable in several technological applications with intrinsic structural chirality which makes them interesting scaffolds for chiroptical properties. As desirable is tuning chiroptical property by synthesis, we combine experimental optical characterization and ab-initio calculations to study how different substituents influence the optical properties of [6]helicene. We explore anchoring groups presenting a variety of sizes and chemical nature, finding that both electron withdrawing and donating groups redshift and dwindle the optical activity of the molecule. We suggest the observed dumping in transitions energy and intensity is connected to the strength of the perturbation induced by the substituent on the pi-conjugation of the aromatic rings. Such observations demonstrate how helicenes' chiroptical properties can be fine-tuned via stereochemical control of the substituents and validates a simple yet effective computational setup to model the optics of those systems.

Title: Magnetic Dichroism in Rutile NiF$_2$: Separating Altermagnetic and Ferromagnetic Effects
Authors: A. Hariki, K. Sakurai, T. Okauchi, J. Kuneš
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the L$_{2,3}$ edge of Ni in the weakly ferromagnetic altermagnet NiF$_2$. Our results predict a significant XMCD signal for light propagating perpendicular to the magnetic moments, which are approximately aligned along the [100] easy-axis direction. The analysis shows that the altermagnetic and ferromagnetic contributions to the XMCD signal can be uniquely distinguished by their dependence on an applied magnetic field. By varying the angle of the field relative to the easy axis, the in-plane orientation of both the Néel vector and the net magnetization can be systematically controlled. We further demonstrate that the XMCD signal, even under fields as strong as 40 T and for any in-plane orientation, can be accurately described as a linear combination of two spectral components, with geometrical prefactors determined by the field magnitude and direction. This insight enables experimental validation of the distinctive relationship between the Néel vector orientation and the x-ray Hall vector in the rutile structure. Quantitative simulations supporting these findings are provided.

Title: Hydrodynamics-driven phase-locking and collective motility of sessile active dumbbells
Authors: Urvi Mahendra Bora, Mohd Suhail Rizvi
Abstract: Collective motion is a phenomenon observed across length scales in nature, from bacterial swarming and tissue migration to the flocking of animals. The mechanisms underlying this behavior vary significantly depending on the biological system, ranging from hydrodynamic and chemical interactions in bacteria to mechanical forces in epithelial tissues and social alignment in animal groups. While collective motion often arises from the coordinated activity of independently motile agents, this work explores a novel context: the emergence of collective motion in systems of non-motile active agents. Inspired by the oscillatory shape dynamics observed in suspended cells such as neutrophils and fibroblasts, we model active dumbbells exhibiting limit-cycle oscillations in shape as a minimal representation of such this http URL computational simulations, we demonstrate that hydrodynamic interactions between these dumbbells lead to three key phenomena: a density-dependent transition from sessile to collective motion, hydrodynamics-induced phase separation, and synchronization of oscillatory shape changes. We have explored the role of hydrodynamic interactions on these emergent properties of sessile active dumbbells. These results underscore the critical role of hydrodynamic coupling in enabling and organizing collective behaviors in systems lacking intrinsic motility. This study lays the groundwork for future investigations into the emergent behavior of active matter and its implications for understanding cell motility, tissue dynamics, and the development of bio-inspired materials.

Title: The impact of alloying elements on the precipitation stability and kinetics in iron based alloys: An atomistic study
Authors: Giovanni Bonny, Christophe Domain, Nicolas Castin, Pär Olsson, Lorenzo Malerba
Abstract: Iron based industrial steels typically contain a large number of alloying elements, even so-called low alloyed steels. Under irradiation, these alloying elements form clusters that have a detrimental impact of the mechanical properties of the steel. The stability and formation mechanisms of such clusters are presently not fully understood. Therefore, in this work, we study the thermal stability and formation kinetics of small solute clusters in the bcc Fe matrix. We use density functional theory (DFT) to characterize the binding energy of vacancy/solute clusters containing Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Si and P, thereby exploring>700 different configurations. The constructed DFT data base is used to fit a cluster expansion (CE) for the vacancy-FeCrMnNiCuSiP system. In turn, the obtained CE is applied in atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to study the effect of Mn, Ni, Cr, Si and P on the precipitation formation in the FeCu alloy. We conclude that the addition of Mn and Ni delay the precipitation kinetics by an order of magnitude. The additional alloying with traces of P/Si further delays the kinetics by an additional order of magnitude. We found that Si plays an essential role in the formation of spatially mixed MnNiCuSi cluster.

Title: Double Microwave Shielding
Authors: Tijs Karman, Niccolò Bigagli, Weijun Yuan, Siwei Zhang, Ian Stevenson, Sebastian Will
Abstract: We develop double microwave shielding, which has recently enabled evaporative cooling to the first Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Two microwave fields of different frequency and polarization are employed to effectively shield polar molecules from inelastic collisions and three-body recombination. Here, we describe in detail the theory of double microwave shielding. We demonstrate that double microwave shielding effectively suppresses two- and three-body losses. Simultaneously, dipolar interactions and the scattering length can be flexibly tuned, enabling comprehensive control over interactions in ultracold gases of polar molecules. We show that this approach works for a wide range of molecules. This opens the door to studying many-body physics with strongly interacting dipolar quantum matter.

Title: Theoretical determination of Gilbert damping in reduced dimensions
Authors: Balázs Nagyfalusi, László Szunyogh, Krisztián Palotás
Abstract: An ab initio scheme based on the linear response theory of exchange torque correlation is presented to calculate intrinsic Gilbert damping parameters in magnets of reduced dimensions. The method implemented into the real-space Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (RS-KKR) Greens' function framework enables to obtain diagonal elements of the atomic-site-dependent on-site and non-local Gilbert damping tensor. Going from the 3D bulk and surfaces of iron and cobalt ferromagnets addressed in our previous work [Phys. Rev. B 109, 094417 (2024)], in the present paper monolayers of Fe and Co on (001)- and (111)-oriented Cu, Ag, and Au substrates are studied, and particularly the substrate-dependent trends are compared. Furthermore, the Gilbert damping parameters are calculated for Fe and Co adatoms and dimers on (001)-oriented substrates. It is investigated how the damping parameter of single adatoms depends on their vertical position. This dependence is quantified in relation to the adatoms' density of states at the Fermi energy showing a non-monotonic behavior. By rotating the spin moment of the adatoms and collinear magnetic dimers, an anisotropic behavior of the damping is revealed. Finally, a significant, three- to ten-times increase of the on-site Gilbert damping is found in antiferromagnetic dimers in comparison to the ferromagnetic ones, whilst the inter-site damping is even more enhanced.

Title: Intricately Entangled Spin and Charge Diffusion and the Coherence-Incoherence Crossover in the High-Dimensional Hubbard Model
Authors: Gopal Prakash, S.R.Hassan, M.S. Laad, N.S.Vidhyadhiraja, T.V.Ramakrishnan
Abstract: Correlation-driven metal-insulator transitions and temperature-driven quantum-coherent-to-incoherent crossovers in correlated electron systems underpin the doping, temperature and frequency-resolved evolution of physical responses. Motivated by recent experimental studies that investigate the evolution of dynamical spin and charge responses, we analyze the spin and charge diffusion spectra in both half-filled and doped one-band Hubbard model using Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) combined with the Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG). We compare the relative strengths and limitations of Density Matrix NRG (DMNRG) and Full Density Matrix NRG (FDM-NRG) in capturing low-frequency spectral features and their evolution with temperature, interaction strength and band-filling. Key measures, including characteristic frequency scales, Kullback-Leibler divergence, diffusion constants, and kurtosis provide complementary but internally consistent picture for the evolution of spin and charge excitations across bandwidth as well as the band-filling driven Mott transitions and the coherent-incoherent crossover. We find that spin and charge fluctuations cross over from quantum-coherent-to-quantum-incoherent at distinct temperatures, providing a microscopic insight into the complex, two-stage, Fermi-to-non-Fermi liquid-to-bad metal crossovers seen in transport data, in particular in the $dc$ resistivity.

Title: Origin of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in ultra-thin metal films studied by in-situ neutron reflectometry
Authors: Grigorii Kirichuk, Alexey Grunin, Artur Dolgoborodov, Pavel Prokopovich, Petr Shvets, Alexey Vorobiev, Anton Devishvilli, Alexandr Goikhman, Ksenia Maksimova
Abstract: Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) plays an important role in different spintronic devices. The rapid development of spintronics requires a better understanding of the nature and mechanisms of the PMA formation. In our article, we demonstrate the potential of studying PMA by in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry combined with pulsed laser deposition. Using these techniques, we show the formation of out-of-plane anisotropy in thin CoFeB films (1.8 nm) with a capping Mo layer. Investigating thick (5.3 nm}) and thin (0.5 nm) molybdenum films, we demonstrate that in both cases, PMA was established in bilayer structures without any thermal annealing. Also, we demonstrate how an additional silicon layer grown over the CoFeB/Mo bilayer can critically alter the magnetic properties of the sample. Such studies are possible only through the unique combination of the growth method with the in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry measurement technique. We believe that this approach will open up broad opportunities for the development and investigation of new spintronic devices.

Title: Two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide based bilayer heterojunctions for efficient solar cells and photocatalytic applications
Authors: Khushboo Dange, Rachana Yogi, Alok Shukla
Abstract: This work presents a first-principles study of the optoelectronic properties of vertically-stacked bilayer heterostructures composed of 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The calculations are performed using the density-functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory within $G_0W_0$-BSE methodology. We aim to propose these TMD heterostructures for solar cell applications. The TMD monolayers comprising the heterojunctions considered in this work are $MoS_2$, $WS_2$, $MoSe_2$, and $WSe_2$ due to their favorable band gaps, high carrier mobility, robust absorption in the visible region, and excellent stability. These four TMD monolayers provide the basis for six heterostructures. Consequently, we have examined the structural, electronic, and optical properties of six heterostructures ($WS_2/MoS_2$, $MoSe_2/MoS_2$, $MoSe_2/WS_2$, $WSe_2/MoS_2$, $WSe_2/MoSe_2$, and $WSe_2/WS_2$). At the DFT level, all the six considered TMD heterostructures meet the essential criterion of type II band alignment, a critical factor in extending carrier lifetime. However, according to $G_0W_0$ results, $MoSe_2/WS_2$ does not exhibit the type II band alignment, instead it shows type I band alignment. The large quasiparticle gaps obtained from $G_0W_0$ approximation suggest the presence of strong electron-correlation effects. The quality of these heterojunction solar cells is estimated by computing their power conversion efficiencies (PCE). The PCEs are calculated at both the HSE06 and $G_0W_0$ levels, and the maximum PCE predicted by HSE06 calculations on our designed solar cells can reach up to 19.25% for the $WSe_2/WS_2$ heterojunction. In addition, all six TMD heterostructures are examined for their potential applications in photocatalysis for hydrogen evolution reaction, and the three of them, namely, $WS_2/MoS_2$, $MoSe_2/MoS_2$, and $WSe_2/MoS_2$ heterostructures qualify for the same.

Title: Electron-phonon coupling and phonon dynamics in single-layer NbSe$_2$ on graphene: the role of moir\'e phonons
Authors: Amjad Al Taleb, Wen Wan, Giorgio Benedek, Miguel M. Ugeda, Daniel Farías
Abstract: The interplay between substrate interactions and electron-phonon coupling in two-dimensional (2D) materials presents a significant challenge in understanding and controlling their electronic properties. Here, we present a comparative study of the structural characteristics, phonon dynamics, and electron-phonon interactions in bulk and monolayer NbSe$_2$ on epitaxial bilayer graphene (BLG) using helium atom scattering (HAS). High-resolution helium diffraction reveals a (9x9)0$^{\circ}$ superstructure within the NbSe$_2$ monolayer, commensurate with the BLG lattice, while out-of-plane HAS diffraction spectra indicate a low-corrugated (3$\sqrt{3}$x3$\sqrt{3}$)30$^{\circ}$ substructure. By monitoring the thermal attenuation of the specular peak across a temperature range of 100 K to 300 K, we determined the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda_{HAS}$ as 0.76 for bulk 2H-NbSe$_2$. In contrast, the NbSe$_2$ monolayer on graphene exhibits a reduced $\lambda_{HAS}$ of 0.55, corresponding to a superconducting critical temperature (T$_C$) of 1.56 K according to the MacMillan formula, consistent with transport measurement findings. Inelastic HAS data provide, besides a set of dispersion curves of acoustic and lower optical phonons, a soft, dispersionless branch of phonons at 1.7 meV, attributed to the interface localized defects distributed with the superstructure period, and thus termed moiré phonons. Our data show that moiré phonons contribute significantly to the electron-phonon coupling in monolayer NbSe$_2$. These results highlight the crucial role of the BLG on the electron-phonon coupling in monolayer NbSe$_2$, attributed to enhanced charge transfer effects, providing valuable insights into substrate-dependent electronic interactions in 2D superconductors.

Title: Observation of zero coefficient of friction above a critical pressure
Authors: Weipeng Chen, Tielin Wu, Yelingyi Wang, Deli Peng, Jin Wang, Zhanghui Wu, Quanshui Zheng
Abstract: Self-superlubricity is a highly anticipated phenomenon where certain solid pairs in contact, without lubricant, exhibit zero wear and virtually null static friction and coefficient of friction (CoF). We present the first experimental observation of self-superlubricity in a microscale single-crystalline graphite flake in contact with a nanoscale-rough Au substrate, achieved when the applied normal pressure exceeds a critical threshold. Theoretical analysis revealed that substrate roughness impedes full contact at low pressures, but increasing the pressure induces a transition to full contact, enabling self-superlubricity. We established a dimensionless criterion for this critical pressure, further validated by observing self-superlubricity between graphite and an atomically smooth sapphire substrate without requiring additional pressure. This breakthrough introduces a transformative principle for next-generation microsystems such as micro/nanoscale generators, motors, oscillators, sensors, etc., enabling reduced power consumption and extended operational lifetimes in applications such as 6G communication, humanoid robotics, and unmanned aerial vehicles.

Title: Experimentally Probing Non-Hermitian Spectral Transition and Eigenstate Skewness
Authors: Jia-Xin Zhong, Jeewoo Kim, Kai Chen, Jing Lu, Kun Ding, Yun Jing
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems exhibit intricate spectral topology arising from complex-valued eigenenergies, with positive/negative imaginary parts representing gain/loss. Unlike the orthogonal eigenstates of Hermitian systems, NH systems feature left and right eigenstates that form a biorthogonal basis and can differ significantly, showcasing pronounced skewness between them. These characteristics give rise to unique properties absent in Hermitian systems, such as the NH skin effect and ultra spectral sensitivity. However, conventional experimental techniques are inadequate for directly measuring the complex-valued spectra and left and right eigenstates -- key elements for enhancing our knowledge of NH physics. This challenge is particularly acute in higher-dimensional NH systems, where the spectra and eigenstates are highly sensitive to macroscopic shapes, lattice geometry, and boundary conditions, posing greater experimental demands compared to one-dimensional systems. Here, we present a Green's function-based method that enables the direct measurement and characterization of both complex-valued energy spectra and the left and right eigenstates in arbitrary NH lattices. Using active acoustic crystals as the experimental platform, we observe spectral transitions and eigenstate skewness in two-dimensional NH lattices under both nonreciprocal and reciprocal conditions, with varied geometries and boundary conditions. Our approach renders complex spectral topology and left eigenstates experimentally accessible and practically meaningful, providing new insights into these quantities. The results not only confirm recent theoretical predictions of higher-dimensional NH systems but also establish a universal and versatile framework for investigating complex spectral properties and NH dynamics across a wide range of physical platforms.

Title: Pb-intercalated epitaxial graphene on SiC: Full insight into band structure and orbital character of interlayer Pb, and charge transfer into graphene
Authors: Bharti Matta, Philipp Rosenzweig, Kathrin Küster, Craig Polley, Ulrich Starke
Abstract: Intercalation is a robust approach for modulating the properties of epitaxial graphene on SiC and stabilizing two-dimensional (2D) intercalant layers at the graphene/SiC interface. In this work, we present synchrotron-based angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements focussing on the band structure of intercalated Pb under a single layer of epitaxial graphene. The interlayer Pb exhibits a metallic character, a $(1 \times 1)$ registry with respect to SiC, and free electron-like bands to a first order. Divergences from the free electron approximation include various band splittings and gaps throughout the Pb Brillouin zone. Light polarization dependent ARPES measurements indicate a predominant out-of-plane orbital character for the Pb bands, suggesting potential interactions between the interlayer Pb and graphene's $\pi$ orbitals that may induce proximity effects in graphene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for a $(1 \times 1)$ Pb monolayer on SiC show a reasonable qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed interlayer bands as well as the polarization dependent measurements. Finally, temperature dependent ARPES measurements reveal that the nearly charge-neutral graphene layer involves charge transfer from both the interlayer Pb and the substrate SiC.

Title: Ferroelectric Properties of van der Waals Chalcogenides: DFT perspective
Authors: Xue Li, James G. McHugh, Vladimir I. Falko
Abstract: Layered materials with non-centrosymmetric stacking order are attracting increasing interest due to the presence of ferroelectric polarization, which is dictated by weak interlayer hybridization of atomic orbitals. Here, we use density functional theory modelling to systematically build a library of van der Waals chalcogenides that exhibit substantial ferroelectric polarization. For the most promising materials, we also analyse the pressure dependence of the ferroelectric effect and charge accumulation of photo-induced electrons and holes at surfaces and internal twin boundaries in thin films of such materials.

Title: Resolving Structural Origins for Superconductivity in Strain-Engineered La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Films

Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high hydrostatic pressure and, more recently, biaxial compression in epitaxial thin films has ignited significant interest in understanding the interplay between atomic and electronic structure in these compounds. Subtle changes in the nickel-oxygen bonding environment are thought to be key drivers for stabilizing superconductivity, but specific details of which bonds and which modifications are most relevant remains so far unresolved. While direct, atomic-scale structural characterization under hydrostatic pressure is beyond current experimental capabilities, static stabilization of strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films provides a platform well-suited to investigation with new picometer-resolution electron microscopy methods. Here, we use multislice electron ptychography to directly measure the atomic-scale structural evolution of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films across a wide range of biaxial strains tuned via substrate. By resolving both the cation and oxygen sublattices, we study strain-dependent evolution of atomic bonds, providing the opportunity to isolate and disentangle the effects of specific structural motifs for stabilizing superconductivity. We identify the lifting of crystalline symmetry through modification of the nickel-oxygen octahedral distortions under compressive strain as a key structural ingredient for superconductivity. Rather than previously supposed $c$-axis compression, our results highlight the importance of in-plane biaxial compression in superconducting thin films, which suggests an alternative -- possibly cuprate-like -- understanding of the electronic structure. Identifying local regions of inhomogeneous oxygen stoichiometry and high internal strain near crystalline defects, we suggest potential pathways for improving the sharpness and temperature of the superconducting transition.

Title: A modular quantum gas platform
Authors: Tobias Hammel, Maximilian Kaiser, Daniel Dux, Philipp M. Preiss, Matthias Weidemüller, Selim Jochim
Abstract: We report on the development of a modular platform for programmable quantum simulation with atomic quantum gases. The platform is centered around exchangeable optical modules with versatile functionalities. The performance of each module is disentangled from all others, enabling individual validation and maintenance of its outputs. The relative spatial positioning of the modules with respect to the position of the atomic sample is set by a global reference frame. In this way, the platform simplifies re-configuration and upgrading of existing setups and accelerates the design of new machines in a time- and cost-efficient manner. Furthermore, it facilitates collaboration among different experimental groups. This standardized hardware design framework, which we call Heidelberg Quantum Architecture, paves the way towards a new generation of on-demand and highly adaptable quantum simulation experiments.

Title: Negative superfluid density and spatial instabilities in driven superconductors
Authors: Andrey Grankin, Victor Galitski, Vadim Oganesyan
Abstract: We consider excitation of Higgs modes via the modulation of the BCS coupling within the Migdal-Eliashberg-Keldysh theory of time-dependent superconductivity. Despite the presence of phonons, which break integrability, we observe Higgs amplitude oscillations reminiscent of the integrable case. The dynamics of quasiparticles follows from the effective Bogolyubov-de Gennes equations, which represent a Floquet problem for the Bogoliubov quasiparticles. We find that when the Floquet-Bogoliubov bands overlap, the homogeneous solution formally leads to a negative superfluid density, which is no longer proportional to the amplitude of the order parameter. This result indicates an instability, which we explore using spatially-resolved BdG equations. Spontaneous appearance of spatial inhomogeneities in the order parameter is observed and they first occur when the superfluid density becomes unphysical. We conclude that the homogeneous solution to time-dependent superconductivity is generally unstable and breaks up into a complicated spatial landscape via an avalanche of topological excitations.

Title: Guided modes in graphene waveguides
Authors: Fan-Ming Zhang, Ying He, Xi Chen
Abstract: By analogy of optical waveguides, we investigate the guided modes in graphene waveguides, which is made of symmetric quantum well. The unique properties of the graphene waveguide are discussed based on the two different dispersion relations, which correspond to classical motion and Klein tunneling, respectively. It is shown that the third-order mode is absent in the classical motion, while the fundamental mode is absent in the Klein tunneling case. We hope these phenomena can lead to the potential applications in graphene-based quantum devices.

Title: Phononic frictional losses of a particle crossing a crystal: linear-response theory
Authors: Gabriele Riva, Giacomo Piscia, Nicolas Trojani, Giuseppe E. Santoro, Erio Tosatti, Nicola Manini
Abstract: We address weak-coupling frictional sliding with phononic dissipation by means of analytic many-body techniques. Our model consists of a particle (the "slider") moving through a two- or three-dimensional crystal and interacting weakly with its atoms, and therefore exciting phonons. By means of linear-response theory we obtain explicit expressions for the friction force slowing down the slider as a function of its speed, and compare them to the friction obtained by simulations, demonstrating a remarkable accord.

Title: Tunable lateral displacement and spin beam splitter for ballistic electrons in two-dimensional magnetic-electric nanostructures
Authors: Xi Chen, Chun-Fang Li, Yue Ban
Abstract: We investigate the lateral displacements for ballistic electron beams in a two-dimensional electron gas modulated by metallic ferromagnetic (FM) stripes with parallel and antiparallel (AP) magnetization configurations. It is shown that the displacements are negative as well as positive, which can be controlled by adjusting the electric potential induced by the applied voltage and the magnetic field strength of FM stripes. Based on these phenomena, we propose an efficient way to realize a spin beam splitter, which can completely separate spin-up and spin-down electron beams in the AP configuration by their corresponding spatial positions.

Title: OstravaJ: a tool for calculating magnetic exchange interactions via DFT
Authors: Jan Priessnitz, Dominik Legut
Abstract: OstravaJ is a Python package for high-throughput calculation of exchange interaction terms in the Heisenberg model for magnetic materials. It uses the total energy difference method, where calculations are based on the total energy of the system in different magnetic configurations, calculated by means of density functional theory. OstravaJ can propose a suitable set of magnetic configurations, generate VASP configuration files in cooperation with the user, and read VASP calculation results, which minimizes necessary human interaction. It can also calculate other relevant properties (e. g. MFA and RPA critical temperature, spin-wave stiffness) and provide input for various atomistic spin dynamics codes. We present results for a number of materials from various classes (metals, transition metal oxides), compared to other methods. They show that the total energy difference method is a useful method for exchange interaction calculation from first principles.

Title: Ultrashort Carbon Nanotubes with Luminescent Color Centers are Ultrabright NIR-II Nano-Emitters

Abstract: Combining brightness and nanoscale size of short-wave infrared (SWIR) emitters is equally essential in the fields of bioimaging, photonics, and quantum science, but such nano-emitters are still lacking. Here we report that when functionalized with luminescent color centers, ultrashort carbon nanotubes with lengths much shorter than 100 nm, are surprisingly bright in the near-infrared second-biological window (NIR-II) of the SWIR. We discuss the origin of this exceptional brightness based on the uncontrollable presence of quenching defects in solubilized carbon nanotubes. The observed NIR-II brightness exceeds that of well-known visible emitters, including quantum dots. After being made biocompatible, ultrashort carbon nanotubes with luminescent color centers open the route toward point-spread function engineering and 3-dimensional single-particle studies for nanoscale NIR-II imaging in thick brain tissue.

Title: Integer Quantum Hall Effect: Disorder, temperature, floating, and plateau width
Authors: Stuart Yi-Thomas, Yi Huang, Jay D. Sau, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: We theoretically consider disorder and temperature effects on the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) using a variety of distinct and complementary analytical and numerical techniques. In particular, we address simple, physical, and experimentally relevant questions: How does disorder and/or temperature affect the IQHE plateau width? Does the plateau width increase or decrease with disorder and/or temperature? What happens to the peak in the longitudinal conductance with increasing disorder/temperature? Does the longitudinal conductance obey any universal scaling property? Is there "floating" with increasing disorder and/or decreasing magnetic field? Can disorder destroy the IQHE? Is there an IQHE to localization transition? What is the Landau level dependence of the plateau width? Our detailed theory provides answers to these and other related experimentally relevant questions. We discuss our results in the context of existing experimental results and suggest future experiments arising from our work. A key finding is that disorder and temperature are intrinsically connected in affecting IQHE, and there is an intricate interplay between them leading to nonmonotonicity in how the IQHE plateau width behaves as a function of increasing disorder.

Title: Frequency Fluctuations in Nanomechanical Resonators due to Quantum Defects
Authors: M. P. Maksymowych, M. Yuksel, O. A. Hitchcock, N. R. Lee, F. M. Mayor, W. Jiang, M. L. Roukes, A. H. Safavi-Naeini
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators promise diverse applications ranging from mass spectrometry to quantum information processing, requiring long phonon lifetimes and frequency stability. Although two-level system (TLS) defects govern dissipation at millikelvin temperatures, the nature of frequency fluctuations remains poorly understood. In nanoscale devices, where acoustic fields are confined to sub-wavelength volumes, strong coupling to individual TLS should dominate over weak coupling to defect ensembles. In this work, we monitor fast frequency fluctuations of phononic crystal nanomechanical resonators, while varying temperature ($10$ mK$-1$ K), drive power ($10^2-10^5$ phonons), and the phononic band structure. We consistently observe random telegraph signals (RTS) which we attribute to state transitions of individual TLS. The frequency noise is well-explained by mechanical coupling to individual far off-resonant TLS, which are either thermally excited or strongly coupled to thermal fluctuators. Understanding this fundamental decoherence process, particularly its RTS structure, opens a clear path towards noise suppression for quantum and sensing applications.

Title: Surface and Bulk Two-Level System Losses in Lithium Niobate Acoustic Resonators
Authors: Rachel G. Gruenke-Freudenstein, Erik Szakiel, Gitanjali P. Multani, Takuma Makihara, Akasha G. Hayden, Ali Khalatpour, E. Alex Wollack, Antonia Akoto-Yeboah, Salva Salmani-Rezaie, Amir H. Safavi-Naeini
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LN) is a promising material for building acoustic resonators used in quantum applications, but its performance is limited by poorly understood material defects called two-level systems (TLS). In this work, we fabricate high-performance acoustic resonators from LN with quality factors up to $6\times10^7$ and use them to separate bulk and surface contributions to TLS loss. By comparing these bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators with previous surface acoustic wave and phononic crystal studies, we show that devices with high surface participation ratios are limited by surface TLS, while our BAW devices reveal an intrinsic bulk TLS limit. Through systematic surface treatments and microscopy, we demonstrate that BAW resonator performance remains unchanged despite surface modifications, confirming operation in a bulk-limited regime. Our work establishes quantitative bounds on both surface and bulk TLS losses in LN, within the context of material growth and fabrication approaches we have pursued, and provides guidance for future device engineering and materials development.

Title: Non-Hermitian Effects in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model: Exploring Substrate Coupling and Decoupling Dynamics
Authors: Shayan Edalatmanesh, Thomas Frederiksen
Abstract: The substrate-adsorbate interaction can significantly influence the adsorbate's electronic structure, stability, reactivity, and topological properties. In this study, we investigate the emergence of non-Hermitian physics in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model when coupled to a substrate, focusing on the impact of substrate interaction on the electronic states of the adsorbate. We demonstrate how the coupling between the SSH chain and the underlying substrate induces non-Hermitian effects, which manifest as amplification or attenuation of zero-energy electronic states. Furthermore, inspired by novel experimental techniques such as using a scanning tunneling microscope tip to lift part of the nanomaterial, we present simulations of scenarios where a segment of the SSH chain is decoupled from the substrate. By examining various configurations, including cases with odd or even numbers of sites coupled to the substrate, we demonstrate that tuning the coupling strength induces novel phenomena, such as the emergence of a zero-energy monomode or additional zero-energy states localized at the boundary between on-surface and suspended chain segments. Our results reveal the role of substrate coupling in shaping the topological properties of non-Hermitian SSH chains, offering new insights into tunable non-Hermitian effects and their potential applications in quantum technologies and nanodevices.

Title: Two-Peak Heat Capacity Accounts for $R\ln(2)$ Entropy and Ground State Access in the Dipole-Octupole Pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$
Authors: E. M. Smith, A. Fitterman, R. Schäfer, B. Placke, A. Woods, S. Lee, S. H.-Y. Huang, S. Sharma, J. Beare, D. Chatterjee, C. Balz, M. B. Stone, A. I. Kolesnikov, A. R. Wildes, P. Manuel, D. Khalyavin, E. Kermarrec, G. M. Luke, O. Benton, R. Moessner, R. Movshovich, A. D. Bianchi, B. D. Gaulin
Abstract: We report new magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K, a factor of three lower than those previously reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However a second, sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, which signifies the entrance to its ground state, as even the most abrupt low-temperature extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K gives a full accounting of $R\ln(2)$ in entropy, associated with the well isolated pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$, at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$, for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical to a quantum spin liquid regime. The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice.

Title: Asymptotics of the Humbert functions $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$
Authors: Peng-Cheng Hang, Malte Henkel, Min-Jie Luo
Abstract: A compilation of new results on the asymptotic behaviour of the Humbert functions $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$, and also on the Appell function $F_2$, is presented. As a by-product, we confirm a conjectured limit which appeared recently in the study of the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model. We also propose two elementary asymptotic methods and confirm through some illustrative examples that both methods have great potential and can be applied to a large class of problems of asymptotic analysis. Finally, some directions of future research are pointed out in order to suggest ideas for further study.

Title: A mathematical model for the progression of dental caries
Authors: Rene Fabregas, Jacob Rubinstein
Abstract: A model for the progression of dental caries is derived. The analysis starts at the microscopic reaction and diffusion process. The local equations are averaged to derive a set of macroscopic equations. The global system includes features such as anisotropic diffusion and local changes in the geometry due to the enamel melting. The equations are then solved numerically. The simulations highlight the effect of anisotropy. In addition we draw conclusions on the progression rate of caries, and discuss them in light of a number of experiments.

Title: Active and passive crosslinking of cytoskeleton scaffolds tune the effects of cell inclusions on composite structure
Authors: Katarina Matic, Nimisha Krishnan, Eric Frank, Michael Arellano, Aditya Sriram, Moumita Das, Megan T Valentine, Michael J Rust, Rae M Robertson-Anderson, Jennifer L. Ross
Abstract: Incorporating cells within active biomaterial scaffolds is a promising strategy to develop forefront materials that can autonomously sense, respond, and alter the scaffold in response to environmental cues or internal cell circuitry. Using dynamic biocompatible scaffolds that can self-alter their properties via crosslinking and motor-driven force-generation opens even greater avenues for actuation and control. However, the design principles associated with engineering active scaffolds embedded with cells are not well established. To address this challenge, we design a dynamic scaffold material of bacteria cells embedded within a composite cytoskeletal network of actin and microtubules that can be passively or actively crosslinked by either biotin-streptavidin or multimeric kinesin motors. Using quantitative microscopy, we demonstrate the ability to embed cells of volume fractions 0.4 to 2% throughout the network without compromising the structural integrity of the network or inhibiting crosslinking or motor-driven dynamics. Our findings suggest that both passive and active crosslinking promote entrainment of cells within the network, while depletion interactions play a more important role in uncrosslinked networks. Moreover, we show that large-scale structures emerge with the addition of cell fractions as low as 0.4%, but these structures do not influence the microscale structural lengthscale of the materials. Our work highlights the potential of our composite biomaterial in designing autonomous materials controlled by cells, and provides a roadmap for effectively coupling cells to complex composite materials with an eye towards using cells as in situ factories to program material modifications.

Title: Annealed mean-field epidemiological model on scale-free networks with a mitigating factor
Authors: K. M. Kim, M. O. Hase
Abstract: An annealed version of the quenched mean-field model for epidemic spread is introduced and investigated analytically and assisted by numerical calculations. The interaction between individuals follows a prescription that is used to generate a scale-free network, and we have adjusted the number of connections to produce a sparse network. Specifically, the model's behavior near the infection threshold is examined, as well as the behavior of the stationary prevalence and the probability that a connection between individuals encounters an infected one. We found that these functions display a monotonically increasing dependence on the infection rate. Subsequently, a modification that mimics the mitigation in the probability of encountering an infected individual is introduced, following an old idea rooted in the Malthus-Verhulst model. We found that this modification drastically changes the probability that a connection meets an infected individual. However, despite this change, it does not alter the monotonically increasing behavior of the stationary prevalence.

Title: Self-similar inverse cascade from generalized symmetries
Authors: Yuji Hirono, Kohei Kamada, Naoki Yamamoto, Ryo Yokokura
Abstract: We investigate the role of generalized symmetries in driving non-equilibrium and non-linear phenomena, specifically focusing on turbulent systems. While conventional turbulence studies have revealed inverse cascades driven by conserved quantities integrated over the entire space, such as helicity in three spatial dimensions, the influence of higher-form symmetries, whose conserved charges are defined by integration over subspaces, remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate a novel mechanism where higher-form symmetries naturally induce a self-similar inverse cascade. Taking axion electrodynamics with non-linear topological interaction as a paradigmatic example, we show that the conserved charge associated with its 1-form symmetry drives the system toward large-scale coherent structures through a universal scaling behavior characterized by analytically determined scaling exponents. Our findings suggest that higher-form symmetries can provide a fundamental organizing principle for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena and the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent systems.

Title: SymSETs and self-dualities under gauging non-invertible symmetries
Authors: Da-Chuan Lu, Zhengdi Sun, Zipei Zhang
Abstract: The self-duality defects under discrete gauging in a categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ can be classified by inequivalent ways of enriching the bulk SymTFT of $\mathcal{C}$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ 0-form symmetry. The resulting Symmetry Enriched Topological (SET) orders will be referred to as $\textit{SymSETs}$ and are parameterized by choices of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, as well as symmetry fractionalization classes and discrete torsions. In this work, we consider self-dualities under gauging $\textit{non-invertible}$ $0$-form symmetries in $2$-dim QFTs and explore their SymSETs. Unlike the simpler case of self-dualities under gauging finite Abelian groups, the SymSETs here generally admit multiple choices of fractionalization classes. We provide a direct construction of the SymSET from a given duality defect using its $\textit{relative center}$. Using the SymSET, we show explicitly that changing fractionalization classes can change fusion rules of the duality defect besides its $F$-symbols. We consider three concrete examples: the maximal gauging of $\operatorname{Rep} H_8$, the non-maximal gauging of the duality defect $\mathcal{N}$ in $\operatorname{Rep} H_8$ and $\operatorname{Rep} D_8$ respectively. The latter two cases each result in 6 fusion categories with two types of fusion rules related by changing fractionalization class. In particular, two self-dualities of $\operatorname{Rep} D_8$ related by changing the fractionalization class lead to $\operatorname{Rep} D_{16}$ and $\operatorname{Rep} SD_{16}$ respectively. Finally, we study the physical implications such as the spin selection rules and the SPT phases for the aforementioned categories.

Title: Richardson-Gaudin states of non-zero seniority I: matrix elements
Authors: Paul A. Johnson
Abstract: Seniority-zero wavefunctions describe bond-breaking processes qualitatively. As eigenvectors of a model Hamiltonian, Richardson-Gaudin states provide a clear physical picture and allow for systematic improvement via standard single reference approaches. Until now, this treatment has been done in the seniority-zero channel. In this manuscript, the corresponding states with higher seniorities are identified, and their couplings through the Coulomb Hamiltonian are computed. In every case, the couplings between the states are computed from the cofactors of their effective overlap matrix. Proof of principle calculations demonstrate that a single reference configuration interaction is comparable with seniority-based configuration interaction computations at a substantially reduced cost. The next manuscript in this series will identify the corresponding Slater-Condon rules and make the computations feasible.

Title: Exotic massive fermionic systems with huge vacuum degeneracy at boundaries
Authors: Hiroki Kawakami, Satoshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We investigate a massive non-relativistic fermionic system exhibiting exotic features. When the mass parameter is set to zero, the system acquires the fermionic subsystem symmetry. Introducing the mass term explicitly breaks this symmetry, resulting in a trivially gapped system in the absence of boundaries. We demonstrate that with the introduction of boundaries, the system remains gapped, but it has a huge vacuum degeneracy. The residual entropy is proportional to the area of the boundary.

Title: Observation of prethermalization in weakly nonintegrable unitary maps
Authors: Xiaodong Zhang, Gabriel M. Lando, Barbara Dietz, Sergej Flach
Abstract: We investigate prethermalization by studying the statistical properties of the time-dependent largest Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda(t)$ for unitary-circuit maps upon approaching integrability. We follow the evolution of trajectories for different initial conditions and compute the mean $\mu(t)$ and standard deviation $\sigma(t)$ of $\Lambda(t)$. Thermalization implies a temporal decay $\sigma \sim t^{-1/2}$ at a converged finite value of $\mu$. We report prethermalization plateaus that persist for long times where both $\mu$ and $\sigma$ appear to have converged to finite values, seemingly implying differing saturated Lyapunov exponent values for different trajectories. The lifetime of such plateaus furnishes a novel time scale characterizing the thermalization dynamics of many-body systems close to integrability. We also find that the plateaus converge to their respective thermal values for long enough times.

Title: Lyapunov-Schmidt bifurcation analysis of a supported compressible elastic beam
Authors: Ee Hou Yong, L. Mahadevan
Abstract: The archetypal instability of a structure is associated with the eponymous Euler beam, modeled as an inextensible curve which exhibits a supercritical bifurcation at a critical compressive load. In contrast, a soft compressible beam is capable of a subcritical instability, a problem that is far less studied, even though it is increasingly relevant in the context of soft materials and structures. Here, we study the stability of a soft extensible elastic beam on an elastic foundation under the action of a compressive axial force, using the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method which we corroborate with numerical calculations. Our calculated bifurcation diagram differs from those associated with the classical Euler-Bernoulli beam, and shows two critical loads, $p^\pm_{\text{cr}}(n)$, for each buckling mode $n$. The beam undergoes a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation at $p^+_{\text{cr}}(n)$ for all $n$ and slenderness. Due to the elastic foundation, the lower order modes at $p^-_{\text{cr}}(n)$ exhibit subcritical pitchfork bifurcations, and perhaps surprisingly, the first supercritical pitchfork bifurcation point occurs at a higher critical load. The presence of the foundation makes it harder to buckle the elastic beam, but when it does so, it tends to buckle into a more undulated shape. Overall, we find that an elastic support can lead to a myraid of buckled shapes for the classical elastica and one can tune the substrate stiffness to control desired buckled modes -- an experimentally testable prediction.

Title: Settling dynamics of non-Brownian suspension of spherical and cubic particles in Stokes flow
Authors: Dipankar Kundu, Florencio Balboa Usabiaga, Marco Ellero
Abstract: The present study investigates the gravity-driven settling dynamics of non-Brownian suspensions of spherical and cubic particles within a triply periodic domain. The effect of solid volume fraction on the evolving microstructure of a suspension is numerically examined by employing the Rigid MultiBlob method under Stokes flow conditions. Our simulations accurately reproduce macroscopic trends observed in experiments and show strong agreement with established semi-empirical correlations over a wide range of volume fractions. It is observed that the hydrodynamic interactions between particles and the surrounding fluid dominate the settling mechanism at low to moderate solid volume fractions, whereas, frequent collisions between particles in a highly packed space tend to suppress velocity fluctuations at denser regime. The transport properties for dilute suspensions are found to be primarily shaped by an anisotropic microstructure, though this anisotropy decreases as many-body interactions significantly grow at higher volume fractions. Notably, cubic particles exhibit lower anisotropy in velocity fluctuations compared to spheres, due to more effective momentum and energy transfer from the gravity-driven direction to transverse directions. Moreover, cubic particles also display higher velocity fluctuations and particle rebounding after collisions, which may create a transient tendency for cubes to move against gravity more readily than spheres. The distinctive behaviors of cubic and spherical particles can notably influence the efficiency of size segregation in bidisperse mixtures. Interestingly, local velocity fluctuation intensity increases for both particle types in mixed suspensions, affecting the local sedimentation velocity field. Overall, spherical particles are found to settle faster than cubes at low to moderate volume fractions.

Title: Compact pulsed laser deposition system for in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry
Authors: Grigorii Kirichuk, Alexey Grunin, Artur Dolgoborodov, Pavel Prokopovich, Petr Shvets, Alexey Vorobiev, Anton Devishvilli, Alexandr Goikhman, Ksenia Maksimova
Abstract: The development of ferromagnet/heavy metal thin-film structures, such as CoFeB/Mo, with spin-orbit interaction requires advanced methods for their production and study. Polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) provides unique insights into the evolution of magnetic properties, especially when applied in-situ during the growth process. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a versatile method for producing magnetic thin films, and combining PLD with in-situ PNR measurements offers new possibilities for their investigation. In this work, we developed a compact vacuum chamber integrated into the neutron instrument, enabling step-by-step deposition and in-situ PNR measurements. A multilayer Mo/[CoFeB/Mo]12 structure was grown, and neutron reflectivity curves measured after each cycle revealed the gradual evolution of sample properties. A weak magnetic field response suggested the potential formation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) at CoFeB/Mo interfaces. Additionally, a single CoFeB film was annealed up to 450°C, followed by the deposition of a ~5 Å Mo layer. PNR measurements in magnetic fields of 0.01 T and 0.75 T showed a significant increase in in-plane magnetization, confirming PMA formation. Thus, we demonstrate the first successful operation of a combined PLD and in-situ PNR system, showcasing its capabilities for characterizing single-layer CoFeB and multilayer CoFeB/Mo thin-film structures.

Title: In-situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR
Authors: Markus J. Buehler
Abstract: The pursuit of automated scientific discovery has fueled progress from symbolic logic to modern AI, forging new frontiers in reasoning and pattern recognition. Transformers function as potential systems, where every possible relationship remains latent potentiality until tasks impose constraints, akin to measurement. Yet, refining their sampling requires more than probabilistic selection: solutions must conform to specific structures or rules, ensuring consistency and the invocation of general principles. We present Graph-PReFLexOR (Graph-based Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning), a framework that combines graph reasoning with symbolic abstraction to dynamically expand domain knowledge. Inspired by reinforcement learning, Graph-PReFLexOR defines reasoning as a structured mapping, where tasks yield knowledge graphs, abstract patterns, and ultimately, final answers. Inspired by category theory, it encodes concepts as nodes and their relationships as edges, supporting hierarchical inference and adaptive learning through isomorphic representations. Demonstrations include hypothesis generation, materials design, and creative reasoning, such as discovering relationships between mythological concepts like 'thin places' with materials science. We propose a 'knowledge garden growth' strategy that integrates insights across domains, promoting interdisciplinary connections. Results with a 3-billion-parameter Graph-PReFLexOR model show superior reasoning depth and adaptability, underscoring the potential for transparent, multidisciplinary AI-driven discovery. It lays the groundwork for general autonomous reasoning solutions.

Abstract: The strong exciton absorption in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides provides a promising platform for studying polaritons with tunable dispersions, which are crucial for controlling polaritonic energy and momentum, but remain underexplored. In this work, monolayer MoS$_2$ is coupled with a Fabry-Pérot microcavity to form polaritons. Five types of Bravais lattices with sub-wavelength periods, based on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) nanopillars, are intentionally designed. The energy overlap between the periodic PMMA scattering wave and the polariton establishes a coupling channel that controls the directional flow of polaritonic energy, as demonstrated through angle-resolved reflectance measurements. Back-space image measurements further demonstrate that the dispersion in reciprocal space can be directly and manually tuned, allowing for control over their number and their positions. The coupling between the polariton and PMMA scattering wave is further demonstrated by analyzing the reflectance using the two-port two-mode model. The symmetries of 2D Bravais lattices allow the angle between energy and momentum flow to vary widely, from 90°, 60°, 45°, and 30° to arbitrary values. By adjusting the lattice vector lengths, the position of the dispersion branch in a specific direction can be fine-tuned, enabling full-range control over polariton dispersion. This work presents the first theoretical and experimental demonstrations of guiding the direction of polaritonic energy and momentum through Bravais lattice design.

Title: Single-step method for the immobilization of hydroxyapatite on 3D-printed porous polyetherketoneketone implants
Authors: Semen Goreninskii, Igor Akimchenko, Alexander Vorobyev, Mikhail Konoplyannikov, Yuri Efremov, Evgeniy Sudarev, Andrei Zvyagin, Evgeny Bolbasov, Sergei Tverdokhlebov
Abstract: The development of tissue engineering structures (scaffolds) for the reconstruction of bone tissue defects is the relevant task of modern biomedical materials science. Compared to metal-based structures, polymer constructs provide numerous advantages, among them - better processibility and metallosis avoidance. Owing to its high mechanical performance and biocompatibility, polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) became a promising material for the development of such structures. Previously, a method for the immobilization of hydroxyapatite (HAp) on PEKK surface was proposed by our group for the enhancement of stem cell adhesion. In the present study, we propose a single-step method of HAp immobilization on the surface of 3D-printed porous PEKK implants. The proposed approach allowed to preserve the morphology (pore diameter, width of the printed lines) of the pristine implants. With that, up to 35.0+-14.0 % of the sample surface were coated with HAp particles, which resulted in improved hydrophilicity (0 degrees water contact angle). The calcium and phosphorus content on the surface of the modified samples was up to 17.4+-4.1 and 8.0+-1.7 wt. %, respectively. Importantly, the proposed modification preserved compressive strength of the 3D-printed porous PEKK implants. HAp immobilization provided better adhesion of stem cells (from 121+-40 cells/mm2 to 234+-8 cells/mm2) and induce their osteogenic differentiation.

Title: Optimal spatial searches with long-range tunneling
Authors: Emma C. King, Moritz Linnebacher, Peter P. Orth, Matteo Rizzi, Giovanna Morigi
Abstract: A quantum walk on a lattice is a paradigm of a quantum search in a database. The database qubit strings are the lattice sites, qubit rotations are tunneling events, and the target site is tagged by an energy shift. For quantum walks on a continuous time, the walker diffuses across the lattice and the search ends when it localizes at the target site. The search time $T$ can exhibit Grover's optimal scaling with the lattice size $N$, namely, $T\sim \sqrt{N}$, on an all-connected, complete lattice. For finite-range tunneling between sites, instead, Grover's optimal scaling is warranted when the lattice is a hypercube of $d>4$ dimensions. Here, we show that Grover's optimum can be reached in lower dimensions on lattices of long-range interacting particles, when the interaction strength scales algebraically with the distance $r$ as $1/r^{\alpha}$ and $0<\alpha<3d/2$. For $\alpha<d$ the dynamics mimics the one of a globally connected graph. For $d<\alpha<d+2$, the quantum search on the graph can be mapped to a short-range model on a hypercube with spatial dimension $d_s=2d/(\alpha-d)$, indicating that the search is optimal for $d_s>4$. Our work identifies an exact relation between criticality of long-range and short-range systems, it provides a quantitative demonstration of the resources that long-range interactions provide for quantum technologies, and indicates when existing experimental platforms can implement efficient analog quantum search algorithms.

Title: Fabry-Perot resonance modes in a MoS$_2$-based vertical stacking cavity for strong light-matter coupling and topological phase singularity

Abstract: Rich dielectric properties in atomic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) enhance light-matter interactions and contribute to a variety of optical phenomena. The direct transfer of TMDs onto photonic crystals facilitates optical field confinement and modifies photon dispersion through the generation of polaritons. However, light-matter interaction is severely limited by this stacking method. This limitation can be significantly improved by constructing a vertical stacking cavity with alternating layers of dielectric material and monolayer MoS$_2$. This multilayer structure is proven to be a compact, versatile, and customizable platform for controlling Fabry-Perot cavity resonance mode. Angle-resolved reflectance further aids in studying resonance mode dispersion. Moreover, the strong light-matter interaction results in multiple perfect absorptions, with the monolayer MoS$_2$ significantly contributing to the absorption in this system, as schematically revealed by the electric field distribution. The multiple perfect absorptions produce an unusual amounts of phase singularities with topological pairs, whose generation, evolution, and annihilation can be controlled by adjusting cavity parameters. Our findings provide a flexible and consistent framework for optimizing light-matter interactions and supporting further studies on wavefront shaping, optical vortices, and topological variants.

Title: Gapless higher-order topology and corner states in Floquet systems
Authors: Longwen Zhou, Rongtao Wang, Jiaxin Pan
Abstract: Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) possess localized and symmetry-protected eigenmodes at corners and along hinges in two and three dimensional lattices. The numbers of these topological boundary modes will undergo quantized changes at the critical points between different HOTPs. In this work, we reveal unique higher-order topology induced by time-periodic driving at the critical points of topological phase transitions, which has no equilibrium counterparts and also goes beyond the description of gapped topological matter. Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.

Title: Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid Behavior in a Rydberg-encoded Spin Chain

Abstract: Quantum fluctuations can disrupt long-range order in one-dimensional systems, and replace it with the universal paradigm of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), a critical phase of matter characterized by power-law decaying correlations and linearly dispersing excitations. Using a Rydberg quantum simulator, we study how TLL physics manifests in the low-energy properties of a spin chain, interacting under either the ferromagnetic or the antiferromagnetic dipolar XY Hamiltonian. Following quasi-adiabatic preparation, we directly observe the power-law decay of spin-spin correlations in real-space, allowing us to extract the Luttinger parameter. In the presence of an impurity, the chain exhibits tunable Friedel oscillations of the local magnetization. Moreover, by utilizing a quantum quench, we directly probe the propagation of correlations, which exhibit a light-cone structure related to the linear sound mode of the underlying TLL. Our measurements demonstrate the influence of the long-range dipolar interactions, renormalizing the parameters of TLL with respect to the case of nearest-neighbor interactions. Finally, comparison to numerical simulations exposes the high sensitivity of TLLs to doping and finite-size effects.

Title: Realization of a doped quantum antiferromagnet with dipolar tunnelings in a Rydberg tweezer array

Abstract: Doping an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator is central to our understanding of a variety of phenomena in strongly-correlated electrons, including high-temperature superconductors. To describe the competition between tunneling $t$ of hole dopants and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin interactions $J$, theoretical and numerical studies often focus on the paradigmatic $t$-$J$ model, and the direct analog quantum simulation of this model in the relevant regime of high-particle density has long been sought. Here, we realize a doped quantum antiferromagnet with next-nearest neighbour (NNN) tunnelings $t'$ and hard-core bosonic holes using a Rydberg tweezer platform. We utilize coherent dynamics between three Rydberg levels, encoding spins and holes, to implement a tunable bosonic $t$-$J$-$V$ model allowing us to study previously inaccessible parameter regimes. We observe dynamical phase separation between hole and spin domains for $|t/J|\ll 1$, and demonstrate the formation of repulsively bound hole pairs in a variety of spin backgrounds. The interference between NNN tunnelings $t'$ and perturbative pair tunneling gives rise to light and heavy pairs depending on the sign of $t$. Using the single-site control allows us to study the dynamics of a single hole in 2D square lattice (anti)ferromagnets. The model we implement extends the toolbox of Rydberg tweezer experiments beyond spin-1/2 models to a larger class of $t$-$J$ and spin-$1$ models.

Title: Low-Temperature Gibbs States with Tensor Networks
Authors: Denise Cocchiarella, Mari Carmen Bañuls
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network method for approximating thermal equilibrium states of quantum many-body systems at low temperatures. In contrast to standard (thermofield double matrix product state) algorithms, our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be simply found with a standard tensor network approach. This method allows us to efficiently compute thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate our approach within a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in the $1\mathrm{D}$ and $2\mathrm{D}$ scenario.

Title: Coiling instability in the kitchen
Authors: Andrzej Herczyński, Maciej Lisicki
Abstract: Manipulation of viscous liquids is an essential kitchen activity - from pouring golden syrup onto a pancake to decorating a cake with whipped cream frosting, from streaming ketchup on top of French fries to dispensing molten chocolate onto a strawberry. Typical viscosities in these and many other kitchen flows, and the heights from which the streams are dispensed, make such jets susceptible to the coiling instability. Indeed, the coiling of a thin thread of poured maple syrup is a source of fascination for children and adults alike, whereas the folding of the stream of ketchup squeezed out from a plastic bottle is a phenomenon familiar to all. In this paper, we review the fluid dynamics of such kitchen flows and discuss separately the case when the substrate is stationary (honey on a toast), and when it translates (cookies on a conveyor belt) or rotates (a pancake on a spinning hot plate). It is hoped that this may encourage experimentation and enjoyment of physics in the kitchen, and perhaps even lead to more elegant if not more tasty culinary results.

Title: Quantum vortices leave a macroscopic signature in the normal fluid
Authors: Luca Galantucci, Giorgio Krstulovic, Carlo F Barenghi
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the remarkable properties of quantum turbulence in superfluid helium II, consisting of a disordered tangle of quantised vortex lines which interact with each other and reconnect when they collide. According to Landau's two-fluid theory, these vortex lines move in a surrounding of thermal excitations called the normal fluid. Until now, the normal fluid has often been considered a passive background which simply provides the vortex lines with a mechanism for dissipating their kinetic energy into heat. Using a model which fully takes into account the two-way interaction between the vortex lines and the normal fluid, here we show that each vortex line creates a macroscopic wake in the normal fluid that can be larger than the average distance between vortex lines; this is surprising, given the microscopic size of the superfluid vortex cores which induce these wakes. We show that in heat transfer experiments, the flow of the normal fluid can therefore be described as the superposition of an imposed uniform flow and wakes generated by the vortex lines, leading to non-classical statistics of the normal fluid velocity. We also argue that this first evidence of independent fluid structures in the thermal excitations postulated by Landau may be at the root of recent, unaccounted for, experimental findings.

Title: Collineations of particles in the Kob-Andersen system
Authors: V.A. Levashov
Abstract: Numerous indications suggest that subtle changes occurring in the structures of liquids on supercooling are connected to the phenomenon of the glass transition and that detailed understanding of these changes is crucial for the development of new glasses with desired properties. J.D. Bernal in his 1962 Bakerian lecture, in particular, reported about an observation of approximately linear chains of several particles, referred to as collineations. He found that in the studied hard sphere system, these collineations can contain up to eight particles. Since then, the collineations of three particles have been discussed in many papers in the context of the splitting of the second peak in pair density functions of supercooled liquids and glasses. However, it appears that longer collineations involving more that three particles have not been systematically studied. Here, we report on our study of such collineations for the Kob-Andersen system of particles on cooling for the parent and inherent structures. Contrary to intuition, our findings reveal that below the potential energy landscape crossover temperature, the number of collineations in the parent structures can exceed that of the corresponding inherent structures. We also introduce a model that connects long collineations with the pair density and angular density distribution functions and demonstrate that this model describes long collineations quite well. The second part of the paper explores potential connections between collineations and: 1) the disclination lines associated with the geometric frustration approach, 2) low-energy clusters from the topological cluster classification approach, 3) chain-like cooperative motion of particles in low-temperature supercooled liquids. For the studied system, according to the used methods, no clear connection was found between collineations and these phenomena.

Title: Room Temperature Optically and Magnetically Active Edges in Phosphorene Nanoribbons

Friend, Jan Behrends, Peter C.M. Christianen, Christopher A. Howard, Raj Pandya
Abstract: Nanoribbons - nanometer wide strips of a two-dimensional material - are a unique system in condensed matter physics. They combine the exotic electronic structures of low-dimensional materials with an enhanced number of exposed edges, where phenomena including ultralong spin coherence times, quantum confinement and topologically protected states can emerge. An exciting prospect for this new material concept is the potential for both a tunable semiconducting electronic structure and magnetism along the nanoribbon edge. This combination of magnetism and semiconducting properties is the first step in unlocking spin-based electronics such as non-volatile transistors, a route to low-energy computing, and has thus far typically only been observed in doped semiconductor systems and/or at low temperatures. Here, we report the magnetic and semiconducting properties of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs). Static (SQUID) and dynamic (EPR) magnetization probes demonstrate that at room temperature, films of PNRs exhibit macroscopic magnetic properties, arising from their edge, with internal fields of ~ 250 to 800 mT. In solution, a giant magnetic anisotropy enables the alignment of PNRs at modest sub-1T fields. By leveraging this alignment effect, we discover that upon photoexcitation, energy is rapidly funneled to a dark-exciton state that is localized to the magnetic edge and coupled to a symmetry-forbidden edge phonon mode. Our results establish PNRs as a unique candidate system for studying the interplay of magnetism and semiconducting ground states at room temperature and provide a stepping-stone towards using low-dimensional nanomaterials in quantum electronics.

Title: Interaction quenches in Bose gases studied with a time-dependent hypernetted-chain Euler-Lagrange method
Authors: Mathias Gartner, David Miesbauer, Michael Kobler, Julia Freund, Giuseppe Carleo, Robert E. Zillich
Abstract: We present a new variational method to study the dynamics of a closed bosonic many-body system, the time-dependent hypernetted-chain Euler-Lagrange method, tHNC . Based on the Jastrow ansatz, it accounts for quantum fluctuations in a non-perturbative way. tHNC scales well with the number of dimensions, as demonstrated by our results on one, two, and three dimensions. We apply the tHNC method to interaction quenches, i.e. sudden changes of the interaction strength, in homogeneous Bose gases. When the quench is strong enough that the final state has roton excitations (as found and predicted for dipolar and Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensates, respectively), the pair distribution function exhibits stable oscillations. For validation, we compare tHNC results with time-dependent variational Monte Carlo results in one and two dimensions.

Title: Dispersive nodal fermions along grain boundaries in Floquet topological crystals
Authors: Daniel J. Salib, Bitan Roy
Abstract: Driven quantum materials often feature emergent topology, otherwise absent in static crystals. Dynamic bulk-boundary correspondence, encoded by nondissipative gapless modes residing near the Floquet zone center and/or boundaries, is its most prominent example. Here we show that topologically robust gapless dispersive modes appear along the grain boundaries, embedded in the interior of Floquet topological crystals, when the Floquet-Bloch band inversion occurring at a finite momentum (${\bf K}^{\rm Flq}_{\rm inv}$) and the Burgers vector (${\bf b}$) of the constituting array of dislocations satisfy ${\bf K}^{\rm Flq}_{\rm inv} \cdot {\bf b}=\pi$ (modulo $2 \pi$). Such nondissipative gapless states can be found near the center and/or edges of the Floquet Brillouin zone, irrespective of the drive protocol. We showcase these general outcomes for two-dimensional driven time-reversal symmetry breaking insulators. Promising experimental platforms hosting such dynamic topological dispersive bands in real materials are discussed.

Title: Charting the space of ground states with tensor networks
Authors: Marvin Qi, David T. Stephen, Xueda Wen, Daniel Spiegel, Markus J. Pflaum, Agnès Beaudry, Michael Hermele
Abstract: We employ matrix product states (MPS) and tensor networks to study topological properties of the space of ground states of gapped many-body systems. We focus on families of states in one spatial dimension, where each state can be represented as an injective MPS of finite bond dimension. Such states are short-range entangled ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. To such parametrized families over $X$ we associate a gerbe, which generalizes the line bundle of ground states in zero-dimensional families (\emph{i.e.} in few-body quantum mechanics). The nontriviality of the gerbe is measured by a class in $H^3(X, \mathbb{Z})$, which is believed to classify one-dimensional parametrized systems. We show that when the gerbe is nontrivial, there is an obstruction to representing the family of ground states with an MPS tensor that is continuous everywhere on $X$. We illustrate our construction with two examples of nontrivial parametrized systems over $X=S^3$ and $X = \mathbb{R} P^2 \times S^1$. Finally, we sketch using tensor network methods how the construction extends to higher dimensional parametrized systems, with an example of a two-dimensional parametrized system that gives rise to a nontrivial 2-gerbe over $X = S^4$.

Title: Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity: a Bayesian mean-field framework for epidemic inference
Authors: Alfredo Braunstein, Giovanni Catania, Luca Dall'Asta, Matteo Mariani, Fabio Mazza, Mattia Tarabolo
Abstract: We present the Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity (SCDC) method, a novel generalized mean-field approximation for epidemic inference and risk assessment within a fully Bayesian framework. SCDC accounts for non-causal effects of observations and uses a graphical model representation of epidemic processes to derive self-consistent equations for edge probability marginals. A small-coupling expansion yields time-dependent cavity messages capturing individual infection probabilities and observational conditioning. With linear computational cost per iteration in the epidemic duration, SCDC is particularly efficient and valid even for recurrent epidemic processes, where standard methods are exponentially complex. Tested on synthetic networks, it matches Belief Propagation in accuracy and outperforms individual-based mean-field methods. Notably, despite being derived as a small-infectiousness expansion, SCDC maintains good accuracy even for relatively large infection probabilities. While convergence issues may arise on graphs with long-range correlations, SCDC reliably estimates risk. Future extensions include non-Markovian models and higher-order terms in the dynamic cavity framework.

Title: Disorder-induced phase transitions in double HgTe quantum wells
Authors: S. S. Krishtopenko, A. V. Ikonnikov, B. Jouault, F. Teppe
Abstract: By using the self-consistent Born approximation, we investigate topological phase transitions in double HgTe quantum wells (QWs) induced by the short-range impurities. Following the evolution of the density-of-states and the spectral function, we demonstrate multiple closings and openings of the band-gap with the increase of the disorder strength due to the mutual inversions between the first and second electron-like and hole-like subbands. We show that starting from a band insulator in the clean limit, under the influence of disorder, the double HgTe QW undergoes a transition, first into a semimetal state similar to "bilayer graphene", and then into a high-order topological insulator state with a double band inversion. We find out that all disorder-induced transitions can be fully characterized by introducing a non-Hermitian quasiparticle Hamiltonian encoding the band structure renormalization and quasiparticle decay.

Title: Kohn-Sham-Proca equations for ultrafast exciton dynamics
Authors: J. K. Dewhurst, D. Gill, S. Shallcross, S. Sharma
Abstract: A long standing problem in time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) has been the absence of a functional able to capture excitonic physics under laser pump conditions. Here we introduce a Kohn-Sham-Proca scheme that we demonstrate reproduces both linear response excitonic effects in the absorption in excellent agreement with experiment for a wide range of materials, but also captures excitonic physics in the highly non-linear regime of ultrafast laser pumping, in particular laser fluence dependent "bleaching" (i.e. reduction) of the excitonic weight and the appearance of excitonic side bands. The approach is a procedural functional -- the Kohn-Sham and Proca equations are simultaneously time propagated -- allowing the straight-forward inclusion of, for example, lattice and spin degrees of freedom into excitonic physics.

Title: Higher condensation theory
Authors: Liang Kong, Zhi-Hao Zhang, Jiaheng Zhao, Hao Zheng
Abstract: We develop a unified mathematical theory of defect condensations for topological orders in all dimensions based on higher categories, higher algebras and higher representations. A k-codimensional topological defect $A$ in an n+1D (potentially anomalous) topological order $C^{n+1}$ is condensable if it is equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_k$-algebra. Condensing such a defect $A$ amounts to a k-step process. In the first step, we condense the defect $A$ along one of its transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-1)-codimensional defect $\Sigma A$, which is naturally equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_{k-1}$-algebra. In the second step, we condense the defect $\Sigma A$ in one of the remaining transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-2)-codimensional defect $\Sigma^2 A$, so on and so forth. In the k-th step, we condense the 1-codimensional defect $\Sigma^{k-1}A$ along the only transversal direction, thus defining a phase transition from $C^{n+1}$ to a new n+1D topological order $D^{n+1}$. We give precise mathematical descriptions of each step in above process, including the precise mathematical characterization of the condensed phase $D^{n+1}$. When $C^{n+1}$ is anomaly-free, the same phase transition can be alternatively defined by replacing the last two steps by a single step of condensing the $E_2$-algebra $\Sigma^{k-2}A$ directly along the remaining two transversal directions. When n=2, this modified last step is precisely a usual anyon condensation in a 2+1D topological order. We derive many new mathematical results physically along the way. Some of them will be proved in a mathematical companion of this paper. We also briefly discuss questions, generalizations and applications that naturally arise from our theory, including higher Morita theory, a theory of integrals and the condensations of liquid-like gapless defects in topological orders.

Title: Ballistic Andreev interferometers
Authors: Régis Mélin, Asmaul Smitha Rashid, Morteza Kayyalha
Abstract: A Josephson junction, formed between two phase-biased superconductors and a normal metal, hosts a discrete spectrum of Andreev bound states (ABS). In this paper, we develop a theory for long ballistic Andreev interferometers in two-dimensional metals. We consider three frameworks in our theoretical analysis: (i) perturbation theory in the tunneling amplitudes; (ii) non-perturbative transport theory; and (iii) physically motivated approximations to visualize the conductance maps in the (flux, voltage) plane. We find a non-standard phase-sensitive Andreev reflection process in ballistic interferometers that couples the supercurrent to the non-equilibrium populations of the ABS in the normal region. Furthermore, our model shows that conductance spectroscopy follows the spectrum of the ABS in long junctions. We also discuss our results in terms of the semiclassical theory, the classical orbits being the one-dimensional Andreev tubes. Our theoretical analysis captures the results of recent experiments by the Penn State and Harvard groups.

Title: Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries
Authors: Rahel L. Baumgartner, Luca V. Delacrétaz, Pranjal Nayak, Julian Sonner
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.

Title: Seasonal footprints on ecological time series and jumps in dynamic states of protein configurations from a non-linear forecasting method characterization
Authors: Leonardo Reyes, Kilver Campos, Douglas Avendaño, Lenin González-Paz, Alejandro Vivas, Ysaías J. Alvarado, Saúl Flores
Abstract: We have analyzed phenology data and protein configurations from molecular dynamics simulations with the nonlinear forecasting method proposed by May and Sugihara. Our primary focus in this work is to characterize the dynamic state of a system by quantifying prediction quality from data. Full plots of prediction quality as a function of dimensionality $E$ and forecasting time $T_p$, the two basic parameters of the method, give fast and valuable information about Complex Systems dynamics. We detect changes in protein dynamics due to mutations and, regarding ecology data, we show how cycles and {\it rhythms} of the environment manifests in parameter space $(E,T_p)$ for some species.

Title: Controllable photocurrent generation in Dirac systems with two frequency drives
Authors: Yuya Ikeda, Sota Kitamura, Takahiro Morimoto
Abstract: We study the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in Dirac and Weyl semimetals under two-frequency light irradiation. We show that the BPVE emerges for centrosymmetric Dirac and Weyl semimetals in the presence of light fields with frequencies $\Omega$ and $2\Omega$. The BPVE under the two frequency drive involves both shift current contribution independent of the carriers lifetime $\tau$ and the injection current contribution $\propto \tau$. Our calculations indicate that the photocurrent's direction, magnitude and type can be dynamically controlled by tuning parameters of the driving fields. Furthermore, we find that the tilt of the Dirac cone significantly affects the photocurrent, particularly in mirror symmetry-lacking Weyl semimetals, leading to an anisotropic optical response. These findings provide new insights into the dynamic control of photocurrents in topological semimetals, offering promising applications for optoelectronic devices.

Title: Self-consistent expansion and field-theoretic renormalization group for a singular nonlinear diffusion equation with anomalous scaling
Authors: Minhui Zhu, Nigel Goldenfeld
Abstract: The method of self-consistent expansions is a powerful tool for handling strong coupling problems that might otherwise be beyond the reach of perturbation theory, providing surprisingly accurate approximations even at low order. First applied in its embryonic form to fully-developed turbulence, it has subsequently been successfully applied to a variety of problems that include polymer statistics, interface dynamics and high order perturbation theory for the anharmonic oscillator. Here we show that the self-consistent expansion can be applied to singular perturbation problems arising in the theory of partial differential equations. We demonstrate its application to Barenblatt's nonlinear diffusion equation for porous media filtration, where the long-time asymptotics exhibits anomalous dimensions that can be systematically calculated using the perturbative renormalization group. We find that even the first order self-consistent expansion improves the approximation of the anomalous dimension obtained by the first-order perturbative renormalization group, especially in the strong coupling regime. We also develop a field-theoretic framework for deterministic partial differential equations to facilitate the application of self-consistent expansions to other dynamic systems, and illustrate its application using the example of Barenblatt's equation. The scope of our results on the combination of renormalization group and self-consistent expansions is limited to partial differential equations whose long-time asymptotics is controlled by incomplete similarity. However, our work suggests that these methods could be applied to a broader suite of singular perturbation problems such as boundary layer theory, multiple scales analysis and matched asymptotic expansions, for which excellent approximations using renormalization group methods alone are already available.

Title: Beyond Dipolar Activity: Quadrupolar Stress Drives Collapse of Nematic Order on Frictional Substrates
Authors: Aleksandra Ardaševa, Ignasi Vélez-Cerón, Martin Cramer Pedersen, Jordi Ignés-Mullol, Francesc Sagués, Amin Doostmohammadi
Abstract: The field of active nematics has traditionally employed descriptions based on dipolar activity, with interactions that align along a single axis. However, it has been theoretically predicted that interactions with a substrate, prevalent in most biological systems, would require novel forms of activity, such as quadrupolar activity, that are governed by hydrodynamic screening. Here, by combining experiments and numerical simulations, we show that upon light-induced solidification of the underlying medium, microtubule-kinesin mixtures undergo a transformation that leads to a biphasic active suspension. Using an active lyotropic model, we prove that the transition is governed by screening effects that alter the dominant form of active stress. Specifically, the combined effect of friction and quadrupolar activity leads to a hierarchical folding that follows the intrinsic bend instability of the active nematic layer. Our results demonstrate the dynamics of the collapse of orientational order in active nematics and present a new route for controlling active matter by modifying the activity through changing the surrounding environment.

Title: Information engine fueled by first-passage times
Authors: Aubin Archambault, Caroline Crauste-Thibierge, Alberto Imparato, Christopher Jarzynski, Sergio Ciliberto, Ludovic Bellon
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of an information engine that extracts work from thermal fluctuations, using a mechanical cantilever submitted to electrostatic feedback control. The cantilever's position is continuously measured, and feedback is triggered by the first passage of the system across a fixed threshold. The information $\Delta I$ associated with the feedback is based on the first-passage-time distribution. In this setting, we derive and experimentally verify two distinct fluctuation theorems that involve $\Delta I$ and give a tight bound on the work produced by the engine. Our results extend beyond the specific application to our experiment: we develop a general framework for obtaining fluctuation theorems and work bounds, formulated in terms of probability distributions of protocols rather than underlying measurement outcomes.

Title: Application of boundary functionals of random processes in statistical physics
Authors: V. V. Ryazanov
Abstract: The potential applications of boundary functionals of random processes, such as the extreme values of these processes, the moment of first reaching a fixed level, the value of the process at the moment of reaching the level, the moment of reaching extreme values, the time the process stays above a fixed level, and other functionals, are considered for the description of physical, chemical, and biological problems. Definitions of these functionals are provided, and characteristic functions are presented for the model with an exponential distribution of incoming demands. A generalization of these limitations is also considered. The potential uses of boundary functionals are demonstrated through examples such as a unicyclic network with affinity A, an asymmetric random walk, nonlinear diffusion, two-level model, Brownian motion, and multiple diffusing particles with reversible target-binding kinetics.

Title: Entanglement Transition due to particle losses in a monitored fermionic chain
Authors: Rafael D. Soares, Youenn Le Gal, Marco Schirò
Abstract: Recently, there has been interest in the dynamics of monitored quantum systems using linear jump operators related to the creation or annihilation of particles. Here, we study the dynamics of the entanglement entropy under quantum jumps that induce local particle losses in a model of free fermions with hopping and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ pairing. We solve the non-unitary dynamics using the recently developed Faber Polynomial method and explore the different steady-state entanglement regimes by tuning the pairing strength, thus interpolating between monitored free fermions coherently driven by a particle number conserving Hamiltonian to a parity conserving one. In the absence of pairing, all quantum trajectories approach the vacuum at long times, with the entanglement entropy showing non-monotonic behavior over time that we capture with a phenomenological quasiparticle \emph{ansatz}. In this regime, quantum jumps play a key role, and we highlight this by exactly computing their waiting-time distribution. On the other hand, the interplay between losses and pairing gives rise to quantum trajectories with entangled steady-states. We show that by tuning the system parameters, a measurement-induced entanglement transition occurs where the entanglement entropy scaling changes from logarithmic to area-law. We compare this transition with the one derived in the no-click limit and observe qualitative agreement in most of the phase diagram. Furthermore, the statistics of entanglement gain and loss are analyzed to better understand the impact of the linear jump operators.

Authors: Jacob T. Sivak, Saeed S. I. Almishal, Mary K. Caucci, Yueze Tan, Dhiya Srikanth, Matthew Furst, Long-Quin Chen, Christina M. Rost, Jon-Paul Maria, Susan B. Sinnott
Abstract: High-entropy materials shift the traditional materials discovery paradigm to one that leverages disorder, enabling access to unique chemistries unreachable through enthalpy alone. We present a self-consistent approach integrating computation and experiment to understand and explore single-phase rock salt high-entropy oxides. By leveraging a machine-learning interatomic potential, we rapidly and accurately map high-entropy composition space using our two descriptors: bond length distribution and mixing enthalpy. The single-phase stabilities for all experimentally stabilized rock salt compositions are correctly resolved, with dozens more compositions awaiting discovery.

Title: Tailoring light holes in $\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ via Anion-Anion Antibonding Coupling
Authors: Ke Xu, Qiaolin Yang, Wenhao Liu, Rong Zhang, Zhi Wang, Jiandong Ye
Abstract: A significant limitation of wide-bandgap materials is their low hole mobility related to localized holes with heavy effective masses ($m_h^*$). We identify in low-symmetric wide-bandgap compounds an anion-anion antibonding coupling (AAAC) effect as the intrinsic factor behind hole localization, which explains the extremely heavy $m_h^*$ and self-trapped hole (STH) formation observed in gallium oxide ($\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$). We propose a design principle for achieving light holes by manipulating AAAC, demonstrating that specific strain conditions can reduce $m_h^*$ in $\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ from 4.77 $m_0$ to 0.38 $m_0$, making it comparable to the electron mass (0.28 $m_0$), while also slightly suppresses the formation of self-trapped holes, evidenced by the reduction in the formation energy of hole polarons from -0.57 eV to -0.45 eV under tensile strain. The light holes show significant anisotropy, potentially enabling two-dimensional transport in bulk material. This study provides a fundamental understanding of hole mass enhancement and STH formation in novel wide-bandgap materials and suggest new pathways for engineering hole mobilities.

Title: Numerical study of Darcy's law of yield stress fluids on a deep tree-like network
Authors: Stéphane Munier, Alberto Rosso
Abstract: Understanding the flow dynamics of yield stress fluids in porous media presents a substantial challenge. Both experiments and extensive numerical simulations frequently show a non-linear relationship between the flow rate and the pressure gradient, deviating from the traditional Darcy law. In this article, we consider a tree-like porous structure and utilize an exact mapping with the directed polymer (DP) with disordered bond energies on the Cayley tree. Specifically, we adapt an algorithm recently introduced by Brunet et al. [Europhys. Lett. 131, 40002 (2020)] to simulate exactly the tip region of branching random walks with the help of a spinal decomposition, to accurately compute the flow on extensive trees with several thousand generations. Our results confirm the asymptotic predictions proposed by Schimmenti et al. [Phys. Rev. E 108, L023102 (2023)], tested therein only for moderate trees of about 20 generations.

Title: Active Brownian particle under stochastic position and orientation resetting in a harmonic trap
Authors: Amir Shee
Abstract: We present an exact analytical study of an Active Brownian Particle (ABP) subject to both position and orientation stochastic resetting in a two-dimensional harmonic trap. Utilizing a Fokker-Planck-based renewal approach, we derive the system's exact moments, including the mean parallel displacement, mean squared displacement (MSD), and the fourth-order moment of displacement, and compare these with numerical simulations. To capture deviations from Gaussian behavior, we analyze the excess kurtosis, which reveals rich dynamical crossovers over time. These transitions span from Gaussian behavior (zero excess kurtosis) to two distinct non-Gaussian regimes: an activity-dominated regime (negative excess kurtosis) and a resetting-dominated regime (positive excess kurtosis). Furthermore, we quantify the steady-state phase diagrams by varying three key control parameters: activity, resetting rate, and harmonic trap strength, using steady-state excess kurtosis as the primary metric.

Title: Modified Jarzynski equality in a microcanonical ensemble
Authors: L. A. Williamson
Abstract: We show that the conventional Jarzynski equality does not hold for a system prepared in a microcanonical ensemble. We derive a modified equality that connects microcanonical work fluctuations to entropy production, in an analogous way to the Jarzynski equality, but with reference to an inverse temperature that depends on the path of the work protocol. For close to isothermal processes the modified equality can improve on the bound $\langle W\rangle\ge \Delta F$. Our result is a special case of a general expression for the microcanonical moment-generating function for any extensive quantity, which enables calculation of the breakdown of ensemble equivalence for thermodynamic fluctuations. We demonstrate our microcanonical Jarzynski equality in a system of driven two-level spins.

Title: Mechanics of pressurized cellular sheets
Authors: Thomas G. J. Chandler, Jordan Ferria, Oliver Shorthose, Jean-Marc Allain, Perla Maiolino, Arezki Boudaoud, Dominic Vella
Abstract: Everyday experience shows that cellular sheets are stiffened by the presence of a pressurized gas: from bicycle inner tubes to bubble wrap, the presence of an internal pressure increases the stiffness of otherwise floppy structures. The same is true of plants, with turgor pressure (due to the presence of water) taking the place of gas pressure; indeed, in the absence of water, many plants wilt. However, the mechanical basis of this stiffening is somewhat opaque: simple attempts to rationalize it suggest that the stiffness should be independent of the pressure, at odds with everyday experience. Here, we study the mechanics of sheets that are a single cell thick and show how a pressure-dependent bending stiffness may arise. Our model rationalizes observations of turgor-driven shrinkage in plant cells and also suggests that turgor is unlikely to provide significant structural support in many monolayer leaves, such as those found in mosses. However, for such systems, turgor does provide a way to control leaf shape, in accordance with observations of curling upon drying of moss leaves. Guided by our results, we also present a biomimetic actuator that un-curls upon pressurization.

Title: Explicit dynamical properties of the Pelikan random map in the chaotic region and at the intermittent critical point towards the non-chaotic region
Authors: Cecile Monthus
Abstract: The Pelikan random trajectories $x_t \in [0,1[$ are generated by choosing the chaotic doubling map $x_{t+1}=2 x_t [mod 1]$ with probability $p$ and the non-chaotic half-contracting map $x_{t+1}=\frac{x_t}{2}$ with probability $(1-p)$. We compute various dynamical observables as a function of the parameter $p$ via two perspectives. In the first perspective, we focus on the closed dynamics within the subspace of probability densities that remain constant on the binary-intervals $x \in [ 2^{-n-1}, 2^{-n}[$ partitioning the interval $x \in [0,1[$ : the dynamics for the weights $\pi_t(n)$ of these intervals corresponds to a biased random walk on the half-infinite lattice $n \in \{0,1,2,..+\infty\}$ with resetting occurring with probability $p$ from the origin $n=0$ towards any site $n$ drawn with the distribution $2^{-n-1}$. In the second perspective, we study the Pelikan dynamics for any initial condition $x_0$ via the binary decomposition $x_t = \sum_{l=1}^{+\infty} \frac{\sigma_l (t)}{2^l} $, where the dynamics for the half-infinite lattice $l=1,2,..$ of the binary variables $\sigma_l(t) \in \{0,1\}$ can be reformulated in terms of two global variables : $z_t$ corresponds to a biased random walk on the half-infinite lattice $z \in \{0,1,2,..+\infty\}$ that may remain at the origin $z=0$ with probability $p$, while $F_t \in \{0,1,2,..t\}$ counts the number of time-steps $\tau \in [0,t-1]$ where $z_{\tau+1}=0=z_{\tau}$ and represents the number of the binary coefficients of the initial condition that have been erased. We discuss typical and large deviations properties in the chaotic region $\frac{1}{2}<p<1 $ as well as at the intermittent critical point $p_c=\frac{1}{2}$ towards the non-chaotic region $0<p<\frac{1}{2}$.

Abstract: We report on terahertz spectroscopic measurements of quantum spin dynamics on single crystals of a spin-1/2 frustrated spin-ladder antiferromagnet BiCu$_2$PO$_6$ as a function of temperature, polarization, and applied external magnetic fields. Spin triplon excitations are observed at zero field and split in applied magnetic fields. For magnetic fields applied along the crystallographic $a$ axis, a quantum phase transition at $B_{c1}=21.4 \mathrm{T}$ is featured by a low-energy excitation mode emerging above $B_{c1}$ which indicates a gap reopening. For fields along the $b$ axis and the $c$ axis, different field dependencies are observed for the spin triplon excitations, whereas no low-lying modes could be resolved at field-induced phase transitions. We perform a theoretical analysis of the magnetic field dependence of the spin triplon modes by using continuous unitary transformations to determine an effective low energy Hamiltonian. Through an exhaustive parameter search we find numerically optimized parameters to very well describe the experimentally observed modes, which corroborate the importance of significant magnetic anisotropy in the system.

Title: Altermagnetism Classification
Authors: Sang-Wook Cheong, Fei-Ting Huang
Abstract: Altermagnets are defined as magnetic states with fully compensated spin angular momenta (spins) and broken PT (P: parity, T: time reversal, PT: parity times time reversal) symmetry. We classify three kinds of altermagnets: M-type: broken T symmetry and nonzero net magnetic moments, S-type: broken T symmetry and zero net magnetic moments, and A-type: unbroken T and broken P symmetries. Furthermore, strong altermagnets have spin split bands through exchange coupling in the non-relativistic limit, i.e., for zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and weak altermagnets has spin split bands only with non-zero SOC. These strong vs. weak altermagnets can be identified from the total number of symmetric orthogonal spin rotation operations. These classifications of altermagnets will be an essential guidance for the future research on altermagnetism.

Title: Expression with self-consistent magnetic units for calculation of critical current density using the Bean's Model
Authors: M. Polichetti, A. Galluzzi, R. Kumar, A. Goyal
Abstract: This study analyzes the calculation of the critical current density Jc,mag by means of Bean's critical state model, using the equation formulated by Gyorgy et al. and other similar equations derived from it reported in the literature. While estimations of Jc,mag using Bean's model are widely performed, improper use of different equations with different magnetic units and pre-factors leads to confusion and to significant errors in the reported values of Jc,mag. In this work, a SINGLE general equation is proposed for the calculation of Jc,mag for a rectangular parallelepiped sample in perpendicular field using Bean's critical state model, underlying how the simple conversion of magnetic units can lead to a Jc,mag in the desired units, without the need to introduce any other correction or use other specific equations depending on the units of Jc,mag. In this equation, the numerical pre-factor is dimensionless, independent of the unit system used. A comparison between the expression reported in the literature is done, showing how they can lead to different results depending on the used units, and that these results can be at least one order of magnitude different from the correct results obtained with the general equation proposed in this work. This resolves all ambiguities and aligns with the correct dimensional analysis, eliminates discrepancies in the calculated Jc,mag, and will avoid further propagation of errors in the literature.

Title: Anomalous conductance steps in 3D TI HgTe-based quantum point contacts
Authors: Elisabeth Richter, Michael Barth, Dmitriy A. Kozlov, Angelika Knothe, Nikolay N. Mikhailov, Juliane Steidl, Cosimo Gorini, Stefan Hartl, Wolfgang Himmler, Klaus Richter, Dieter Weiss
Abstract: We explore electrical transport through a point contact in strained HgTe, a three-dimensional topological insulator. In the absence of a magnetic field $B$, there is no quantization. However, under higher magnetic fields, we observe distinct non-integer conductance steps. Based on numerical tight-binding calculations and a phenomenological Landauer-Büttiker approach, we attribute these atypical, non-integer quantized plateaus to significant scattering effects at the point contact.

Title: Tuning the lasing threshold of quantum well exciton-polaritons under a magnetic field in Faraday geometry: a theoretical study
Authors: Le Tri Dat, Nguyen Dung Chinh, Vo Quoc Phong, Nguyen Duy Vy
Abstract: Polariton lasing is a promising phenomenon with potential applications in next-generation lasers that operate without the need for population inversion. Applying a perpendicular magnetic field to a quantum well (QW) significantly alters the properties of exciton-polaritons. In this theoretical study, we investigate how the lasing threshold of QW exciton-polaritons depends on the magnetic field. By modifying the exciton's effective mass and Rabi splitting, the magnetic field induces notable changes in the relaxation kinetics, which directly affect the lasing threshold. For low-energy pumping, an increase in the magnetic field delays the lasing threshold, while for high-energy pumping, the threshold is reached at much lower pump intensities. Furthermore, increasing both the pump energy and the magnetic field enhances relaxation efficiency, leading to a substantially larger number of condensed polaritons. Our result gives insights into the modulation of exciton-polariton condensation through magnetic fields, with potential implications for the design of low-threshold polariton lasers.

Title: Josephson effect and odd-frequency pairing in superconducting junctions with unconventional magnets
Authors: Yuri Fukaya, Kazuki Maeda, Keiji Yada, Jorge Cayao, Yukio Tanaka, Bo Lu
Abstract: We consider Josephson junctions formed by coupling two conventional superconductors via an unconventional magnet and investigate the formation of Andreev bound states, their impact on the Josephson effect, and the emergent superconducting correlations. We focus on unconventional magnets known as $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. We find that the Andreev bound states in $d$-wave altermagnet and $p_y$-wave magnet Josephson junctions strongly depend on the transverse momentum, with a spin splitting and low-energy minima as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$. In contrast, the Andreev bound states for $p_{x}$-wave magnets are insensitive to the transverse momentum. We show that the Andreev bound states can be probed by the local density of states in the middle of the junction, which also reveals that $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- and $p$-wave magnet junctions are prone to host zero energy peaks. While the zero-energy peak in $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnet junctions tends to oscillate with the magnetic order, it remains robust in $p$-wave magnet junctions. We also demonstrate that the critical currents in $d$-wave altermagnet Josephson junctions exhibit an oscillatory decay with the increase of the magnetic order, while the oscillations are absent in $p$-wave magnet junctions albeit the currents exhibit a slow decay. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the interplay of the Josephson effect and unconventional magnetic order of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets originates from odd-frequency spin-triplet $s$-wave superconducting correlations that are otherwise absent. Our results can serve as a guide to pursue the new functionality of Josephson junctions based on unconventional magnets.

Title: Stochastic thermodynamics and the Ericsson nano engine -- Efficiency from equilibrium results
Authors: Jasleen Kaur, Aritra Ghosh, Sushanta Dattagupta, Subhash Chaturvedi, Malay Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: In this work, we study an Ericsson cycle whose working substance is a charged (quantum) oscillator in a magnetic field that is coupled to a heat bath. The resulting quantum Langevin equations with built-in noise terms encapsulate a thermodynamic structure and allow for the computation of the efficiency of the cycle. We numerically compute the efficiency of the cycle in the quasi-static regime using the steady-state thermodynamic functions of the system. Interestingly, it is found that by increasing the system-bath coupling strength, the efficiency of the cycle can be tuned to a maximum. We also explore the behavior of the efficiency as a function of the pair of magnetic-field values between which the cycle is operated.

Title: The thermodynamics of CaSiO3 in Earth's lower mantle
Authors: Yongjoong Shin, Enrico Di Lucente, Nicola Marzari, Lorenzo Monacelli
Abstract: The lower mantle of Earth, characterized by pressures of 24-127 GPa and temperatures of 1900-2600 K, is still inaccessible to direct observations. In this work, we investigate by first principles the stability, phase diagram, elastic properties, and thermal conductivity of CaSiO3, that constitutes a significant component of Earth's lower mantle. Notably, our simulations capture in full the anharmonic ionic fluctuations arising from the extreme temperatures and pressures of the lower mantle, thanks to the use of stochastic self-consistant harmonic approximation (SSCHA). We show that the cubic phase of CaSiO3 is the stable state at the lower mantle's thermodynamic conditions. The phase boundary between the cubic and tetragonal phases is of first-order and increases linearly from 300 K to 1000 K between 12 GPa and 100 GPa. Accounting for temperature-renormalized phonon dispersions, we evaluate the speed of sound as a function of depth. Our results downplay the role of octahedral rotations on the transverse sound velocity of cubic CaSiO3, advocated in the past to explain discrepancies between theory and experiments. The lattice thermal conductivity, assessed thanks to the recently introduced Wigner formalism, shows a predominance of particle-like transport, thus justifying the use of the standard Boltzmann transport equation even in a system with such strong ionic anharmonicity.

Title: Dynamics of Quantum-Classical Systems in Nonequilibrium Environments
Authors: Jeremy Schofield, Raymond Kapral
Abstract: The dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a classical environment and subject to constraints that drive it out of equilibrium is described. The evolution of the system is governed by the quantum-classical Liouville equation. Rather than evaluating the evolution of the mixed quantum-classical density operator, we derive exact equations of motion for the nonequilibrium average values of a set of operators or variables, along with correlation function expressions for the dissipative coefficients that enter these equations. These equations are obtained by requiring that the exact nonequilibrium averages are equal to local nonequilibrium averages that depend on auxiliary fields whose values satisfy evolution equations obtained using projection operator methods. The results are illustrated by deriving reaction-diffusion equations coupled to fluid hydrodynamic equations for a dilute solution of quantum particles that can exist in two metastable states. Nonequilibrium steady states are discussed along with the reaction rate and diffusion correlation functions that characterize such states.

Title: rt-TDDFT modeling of thermal emission by laser-heated glasses
Authors: Grigory Kolesov
Abstract: In the laser processing of glass, a ~50-1000 $\mu$m-thick layer of glass is heated to a high temperature by the laser beam. Due to the shallow depth of this hot layer, the infrared emission and absorption spectra may deviate from the black-body spectra and can be influenced by the vibrational structure of the material. Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) modeling of the thermal radiation by such hot layers allows us to calculate the emissivity and thus to evaluate the reliability of the measurements conducted with thermal cameras at specific wavelengths.

Title: Non-relativistic linear Edelstein effect in non-collinear EuIn2As2
Authors: Nayra A. Álvarez Pari, Rodrigo Jaeschke-Ubiergo, Atasi Chakraborty, Libor Šmejkal, Jairo Sinova
Abstract: Motivated by the ongoing interest in understanding the actual magnetic ground state of the promising axion insulator candidate EuIn2As2, we present here a spin symmetry analysis and ab-initio calculations, aiming to identify specific exchange-dominated physics that could offer insights into the current debate. We investigate two non-collinear coplanar magnetic orders reported in this compound: the helical and broken helical phases. Our symmetry analysis shows that magnetic-exchange alone results in the formation of an out-of-plane odd-wave order in momentum space with a single un-polarized nodal plane in both phases. Additionally, we identified an in-plane g-wave order that emerges exclusively in the broken helical phase, providing a distinguishing feature for this phase. Furthermore, we report a non-relativistic Edelstein effect with a distinct out-of-plane polarized spin density that dominates over spin-orbit coupling effects. Our ab-initio calculations reveal a significant contrast in the magnitude of this effect between both phases, which could serve as a means to identify the magnetic transition and distinguish them from other magnetic ground states proposed for this compound.

Title: Classical Annealing of Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Spin Glass Using Suzuki-Kubo Mean-field Ising Dynamics
Authors: Soumyaditya Das, Soumyajyoti Biswas, Bikas K. Chakrabarti
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate numerically a fast classical annealing scheme for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model, employing the Suzuki-Kubo meanfield Ising dynamics (supplemented by a modified Thouless-Anderson-Palmer reaction field). The resultant dynamics, starting from any arbitrary paramagnetic phase (with local $m_i=\pm 1$ for the $i^{th}$ spin, and the global magnetization $m=0$), takes the system quickly to an appropriate state with small local values of magnetization ($m_i$) commensurate with the (frustrated) interactions. As the temperature decreases with the annealing, the configuration practically remain (in an effective adiabatic way) close to the ground state as the $m_i$'s and the spin glass order parameter $q$ grow to unity. For an $N$-spin SK model (with $N$ up to 10000) the deviation in the annealed ground state energy per spin $E^0_N - E^0$ is found to scale as $N^{-2/3}$, with $E^0 = -0.7633\pm 0.0002 $ (analytical estimate being $E^0 =-0.7631667265 \dots$), fluctuation $\sigma_N $ in $E^0_N$ decreases as $\sim N^{-3/4}$ and the annealing time $\tau_N \sim N$, making this protocol highly efficient in estimating the ground state of the SK model.

Title: Nonequilibrium Response Theory: From Precision Limits to Strong Perturbation
Authors: Ruicheng Bao, Shiling Liang
Abstract: Understanding the response of nonequilibrium systems to external perturbations remains a fundamental challenge in statistical physics. Here, we prove a novel universal bound stating that the response precision for state observable is fundamentally constrained to $1/2$ under single edge or vertex perturbations, independent of system size. Furthermore, we develop exact relations connecting responses to perturbations of arbitrary strengths, extending nonequilibrium response theory beyond the weak-perturbation regime. Through response equalities we also provide a novel physical interpretation of response sensitivity and recovers bounds previously obtained using graph-theoretical methods and extensive linear algebra. Our results provide a general mathematical framework applicable across diverse nonequilibrium systems and offer design principles for optimal sensing and information processing in biochemical systems.

Title: Colour symmetry and non-collinear altermagnetism
Authors: Paolo G. Radaelli, Gautam Gurung
Abstract: We present a formalism based on colour symmetry to analyse the momentum-space spin textures of non-collinear magnets. We show that, out of the spin textures allowed by the magnetic point group, one can extract an `altermagnetic' component that is invariant by general rotations in spin space, and can exist in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate this approach in the case of three complex, non-collinear magnets, Mn$_3$Ir(Ge,Si), Pb$_2$MnO$_4$ and Mn$_3$GaN. For Mn$_3$GaN, we also show that the predictions of colour-symmetry analysis are consistent with density functional theory calculations performed on the same system both with and without spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Control Strategies for Maintaining Transport Symmetries Far From Equilibrium
Authors: David Andrieux
Abstract: We present two schemes for controlling the transport dynamics of mesoscopic devices. In both approaches, we manipulate the system's output - such as particle currents and energy flows - while maintaining symmetric transport properties, even under far-from-equilibrium conditions. We provide exact descriptions of the modified processes under each scheme and investigate their characteristics. Notably, one of the schemes is shown to minimize the dissimilarity between the original and modified processes, as quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. These findings have the potential to enhance the design and control of mesoscopic systems.

Title: First-principles Investigation of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$: A Multifunctional Heteroanionic Oxychalcogenide for Photocatalytic and Thermoelectric Applications
Authors: G. Thamizharasan, R. D. Eithiraj
Abstract: The development of industrial growth raises global energy demand. Novel materials with promising unorthodox features satiate and demand for sustainable, non-toxic, and cost-effective energy. A first-principles investigation were carried out to ground state and transport properties of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ towards energy harvesting and photocatalytic applications was carried out. In groundstate the CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ showed good mechanically stable with a volume of (1138.235 \textÅ^3) and a high elastic modulus of (215.73 GPa). Further, the electronic properties of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$, PBE-GGA exchange-correlation was utilized, demonstrates direct and indirect transitions with a wide bandgap of 2.7 and 2.8 eV, indicating its semiconducting nature. Photoinduced charge carriers were investigated through Deformation Potential Theory (DPT) to estimate the mobility of charge carriers, excitonic radius, and effective mass. Axial anisotropic strain in band degeneracy and shifts in the S-Y and Y-\Gamma transitions offer a (3.17 \textÅ^3) Frenkel-type strongly bound exciton with a high carrier mobility of (2409.91 \, \text{cm}^2 \, \text{V}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}) electrons and (316.46 \, \text{cm}^2 \, \text{V}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}) holes respectively. To estimate the feasibility of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ in photocatalysis, we examined the conduction and valence band edges under harsh pH conditions within PBE-GGA exchange-correlation functionals. The band edges of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ show the halfway reaction for hydrogen evolution with reference to the Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE). Moreover, the Boltzmann equation interface was used to investigate the transport and thermoelectric properties. A high Seebeck coefficient in CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ at 300 K directs a thermoelectric figure of merit of 0.94.

It consists in optimizing a linear combination of the costs for all the possible $N$'s, while fixing a certain linear combination of the corresponding marginals.

Title: Decoding general error correcting codes and the role of complementarity
Authors: Yoshifumi Nakata, Takaya Matsuura, Masato Koashi
Abstract: Among various classes of quantum error correcting codes (QECCs), non-stabilizer codes have rich properties and are of theoretical and practical interest. Decoding non-stabilizer codes is, however, a highly non-trivial task. In this paper, we show that a decoding circuit for Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes can be straightforwardly extended to handle general QECCs. The key to the extension lies in the use of a pair of classical-quantum (CQ) codes associated with the QECC to be decoded. The decoding error of the proposed decoding circuit depends on the classical decoding errors of the CQ codes and their degree of complementarity. We demonstrate the power of the decoding circuit in a toy model of the black hole information paradox, improving decoding errors compared to previous results. In addition, we reveal that black hole dynamics may optimally encode quantum information but poorly encode classical information.

Title: A Stochastic Block Hypergraph model
Authors: Alexis Pister, Marc Barthelemy
Abstract: The stochastic block model is widely used to generate graphs with a community structure, but no simple alternative currently exists for hypergraphs, in which more than two nodes can be connected together through a hyperedge. We discuss here such a hypergraph generalization, based on the clustering connection probability $P_{ij}$ between nodes of communities $i$ and $j$, and that uses an explicit and modulable hyperedge formation process. We focus on the standard case where $P_{ij}=p\delta_{ij}+q(1-\delta_{ij})$ when $0\leq q\leq p$. We propose a simple model that satisfies three criteria: it should be as simple as possible, when $p = q$ the model should be equivalent to the standard hypergraph random model, and it should use an explicit and modulable hyperedge formation process so that the model is intuitive and can easily express different real-world formation processes. We first show that for such a model the degree distribution and hyperedge size distribution can be approximated by binomial distributions with effective parameters that depend on the number of communities and $q/p$. Also, the composition of hyperedges goes for $q=0$ from `pure' hyperedges (comprising nodes belonging to the same community) to `mixed' hyperedges that comprise nodes from different communities for $q=p$. We test various formation processes and our results suggest that when they depend on the composition of the hyperedge, they tend to favor the dominant community and lead to hyperedges with a smaller diversity. In contrast, for formation processes that are independent from the hyperedge structure, we obtain hyperedges comprising a larger diversity of communities. The advantages of the model proposed here are its simplicity and flexibility that make it a good candidate for testing community-related problems, such as their detection, impact on various dynamics, and visualization.

Title: Extracting Error Thresholds through the Framework of Approximate Quantum Error Correction Condition
Authors: Yuanchen Zhao, Dong E. Liu
Abstract: The robustness of quantum memory against physical noises is measured by two methods: the exact and approximate quantum error correction (QEC) conditions for error recoverability, and the decoder-dependent error threshold which assesses if the logical error rate diminishes with system size. Here we unravel their relations and propose a unified framework to extract an intrinsic error threshold from the approximate QEC condition, which could upper bound other decoder-dependent error thresholds. Our proof establishes that relative entropy, effectively measuring deviations from exact QEC conditions, serves as the order parameter delineating the transition from asymptotic recoverability to unrecoverability. Consequently, we establish a unified framework for determining the error threshold across both exact and approximate QEC codes, addressing errors originating from noise channels as well as those from code space imperfections. This result sharpens our comprehension of error thresholds across diverse QEC codes and error models.

Title: Quantum dimer models with Rydberg gadgets
Authors: Zhongda Zeng, Giuliano Giudici, Hannes Pichler
Abstract: The Rydberg blockade mechanism is an important ingredient in quantum simulators based on neutral atom arrays. It enables the emergence of a rich variety of quantum phases of matter, such as topological spin liquids. The typically isotropic nature of the blockade effect, however, restricts the range of natively accessible models and quantum states. In this work, we propose a method to systematically overcome this limitation, by developing gadgets, i.e., specific arrangements of atoms, that transform the underlying Rydberg blockade into more general constraints. We apply this technique to realize dimer models on square and triangular geometries. In these setups, we study the role of the quantum fluctuations induced by a coherent drive of the atoms and find signatures of $U(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid states in the respective ground states. Finally, we show that these states can be dynamically prepared with high fidelity, paving the way for the quantum simulation of a broader class of constrained models and topological matter in experiments with Rydberg atom arrays.

Title: Cell-level modelling of homeostasis in confined epithelial monolayers
Authors: KVS Chaithanya, Jan Rozman, Andrej Košmrlj, Rastko Sknepnek
Abstract: Tissue homeostasis, the biological process of maintaining a steady state in tissue via control of cell proliferation, death, and metabolic function, is essential for the development, growth, maintenance, and proper function of living organisms. Disruptions to this process can lead to serious diseases and even death. In this study, we use the vertex model for the cell-level description of tissue mechanics to investigate the impact of the tissue microenvironment and local mechanical properties of cells on homeostasis in confined epithelial tissues. We find a dynamic steady state, where the balance between cell divisions and removals sustains homeostasis. By characterising homeostasis in terms of cell count, tissue area, and the cells' neighbour count distribution, we identify the factors that govern regulated and ordered tissue growth. This work, therefore, sheds light on the mechanisms underlying tissue homeostasis and highlights the importance of mechanics in the control of biological processes such as tissue development and disease pathology.

Title: Classifying two-body Hamiltonians for Quantum Darwinism
Authors: Emery Doucet, Sebastian Deffner
Abstract: Quantum Darwinism is a paradigm to understand how classically objective reality emerges from within a fundamentally quantum universe. Despite the growing attention that this field of research as been enjoying, it is currently not known what specific properties a given Hamiltonian describing a generic quantum system must have to allow the emergence of classicality. Therefore, in the present work, we consider a broadly applicable generic model of an arbitrary finite-dimensional system interacting with an environment formed from an arbitrary collection of finite-dimensional degrees of freedom via an unspecified, potentially time-dependent Hamiltonian containing at most two-body interaction terms. We show that such models support quantum Darwinism if the set of operators acting on the system which enter the Hamiltonian satisfy a set of commutation relations with a pointer observable and with one other. We demonstrate our results by analyzing a wide range of example systems: a qutrit interacting with a qubit environment, a qubit-qubit model with interactions alternating in time, and a series of collision models including a minimal model of a quantum Maxwell demon.

Hudson, Kohei M. Itoh, Riley J. Murray, Robin Blume-Kohout, Thaddeus D. Ladd, Namit Anand, Andrew S. Dzurak, Barry C. Sanders, David N. Jamieson, Andrea Morello
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum systems are a valuable resource for quantum information processing. They can be used to encode error-correctable logical qubits, which has been demonstrated using continuous-variable states in microwave cavities or the motional modes of trapped ions. For example, high-dimensional systems can be used to realise `Schrödinger cat' states, superpositions of widely displaced coherent states that can also be used to illustrate quantum effects at large scales. Recent proposals have suggested encoding qubits in high-spin atomic nuclei, finite-dimensional systems that can host hardware-efficient versions of continuous-variable codes. Here we demonstrate the creation and manipulation of Schrodinger cat states using the spin-7/2 nucleus of an antimony atom embedded in a silicon nanoelectronic device. We use a multi-frequency control scheme to produce spin rotations that preserve the symmetry of the qudit, and constitute logical Pauli operations for qubits encoded in the Schrodinger cat states. Our work demonstrates the ability to prepare and control nonclassical resource states, a prerequisite for applications in quantum information processing and quantum error correction using our scalable, manufacturable semiconductor platform.

Title: Effective Polaron Dynamics of an Impurity Particle Interacting with a Fermi Gas
Authors: Duc Viet Hoang, Peter Pickl
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a homogeneous ideal Fermi gas coupled to an impurity particle on a three-dimensional box with periodic boundary condition. For large Fermi momentum $k_\text{F}$, we prove that the effective dynamics is generated by a Fröhlich-type polaron Hamiltonian, which linearly couples the impurity particle to an almost-bosonic excitation field. Moreover, we prove that the effective dynamics can be approximated by an explicit coupled coherent state. Our method is applicable to a range of interaction couplings, in particular including interaction couplings of order 1 and time scales of the order $k_\text{F}^{-1}$.

Title: Role of Quantum Coherence in Kinetic Uncertainty Relations
Authors: Kacper Prech, Patrick P. Potts, Gabriel T. Landi
Abstract: The Kinetic Uncertainty Relation (KUR) bounds the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic currents in terms of the number of transitions per unit time, known as the dynamical activity. This bound was derived in a classical context, and can be violated in the quantum regime due to coherent effects. However, the precise connection between KUR violations and quantum coherence has so far remained elusive, despite significant investigation. In this work, we solve this problem by deriving a modified bound that exactly pinpoints how, and when, coherence might lead to KUR violations. Our bound is sensitive to the specific kind of unraveling of the quantum master equation. It therefore allows one to compare quantum jumps and quantum diffusion, and understand, in each case, how quantum coherence affects fluctuations. We illustrate our result on a double quantum dot, where the electron current is monitored either by electron jump detection or with continuous diffusive charge measurement.

Title: SeeBand: A highly efficient, interactive tool for analyzing electronic transport data
Authors: Michael Parzer, Alexander Riss, Fabian Garmroudi, Johannes de Boor, Takao Mori, Ernst Bauer
Abstract: Linking the fundamental physics of band structure and scattering theory with macroscopic features such as measurable bulk thermoelectric transport properties is indispensable to a thorough understanding of transport phenomena and ensures more targeted and efficient experimental research. Here, we introduce SeeBand, a highly efficient and interactive fitting tool based on Boltzmann transport theory. A fully integrated user interface and visualization tool enable real-time comparison and connection between the electronic band structure (EBS) and microscopic transport properties. It allows simultaneous analysis of data for the Seebeck coefficient $S$, resistivity $\rho$ and Hall coefficient $R_\text{H}$ to identify suitable EBS models and extract the underlying microscopic material parameters and additional information from the model. Crucially, the EBS can be obtained by directly fitting the temperature-dependent properties of a single sample, which goes beyond previous approaches that look into doping dependencies. Finally, the combination of neural-network-assisted initial guesses and an efficient subsequent fitting routine allows for a rapid processing of big datasets, facilitating high-throughput analyses to identify underlying, yet undiscovered dependencies, thereby guiding material design.

Title: Quantized axial charge of staggered fermions and the chiral anomaly
Authors: Arkya Chatterjee, Salvatore D. Pace, Shu-Heng Shao
Abstract: In the 1+1D ultra-local lattice Hamiltonian for staggered fermions with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, there are two conserved, integer-valued charges that flow in the continuum limit to the vector and axial charges of a massless Dirac fermion with a perturbative anomaly. Each of the two lattice charges generates an ordinary U(1) global symmetry that acts locally on operators and can be gauged individually. Interestingly, they do not commute on a finite lattice and generate the Onsager algebra, but their commutator goes to zero in the continuum limit. The chiral anomaly is matched by this non-abelian algebra, which is consistent with the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We further prove that the presence of these two conserved lattice charges forces the low-energy phase to be gapless, reminiscent of the consequence from perturbative anomalies of continuous global symmetries in continuum field theory. Upon bosonization, these two charges lead to two exact U(1) symmetries in the XX model that flow to the momentum and winding symmetries in the free boson conformal field theory.

Title: Quantum Compilation Toolkit for Rydberg Atom Arrays with Implications for Problem Hardness and Quantum Speedups
Authors: Martin J. A. Schuetz, Ruben S. Andrist, Grant Salton, Romina Yalovetzky, Rudy Raymond, Yue Sun, Atithi Acharya, Shouvanik Chakrabarti, Marco Pistoia, Helmut G. Katzgraber
Abstract: We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.

Title: Scheme to Detect the Strong-to-weak Symmetry Breaking via Randomized Measurements
Authors: Ning Sun, Pengfei Zhang, Lei Feng
Abstract: Symmetry breaking plays a central role in classifying the phases of quantum many-body systems. Recent developments have highlighted a novel symmetry-breaking pattern, in which the strong symmetry of a density matrix spontaneously breaks to the week symmetry. This strong-to-weak symmetry breaking is typically detected using multi-replica correlation functions, such as the Rényi-2 correlator. In this letter, we propose a practical protocol for detecting strong-to-weak symmetry breaking in experiments using the randomized measurement toolbox. Our scheme involves collecting the results of random Pauli measurements for (i) the original quantum state and (ii) the quantum state after evolution with the charged operators. Based on the measurement results, with a large number of samples, we can obtain the exact solution to the Rényi-2 correlator. With a small sample size, we can still provide an alternative approach to estimate the phase boundary to a decent accuracy. We perform numerical simulations of Ising chains with all-to-all decoherence as an exemplary demonstration. Our result opens the opportunity for the experimental studies of the novel quantum phases in mixed quantum states.

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains.

Title: Zero-temperature phase-flip rate in a biased parametric oscillator
Authors: Daniel K. J. Boneß, Wolfgang Belzig, Mark I. Dykman
Abstract: A parametrically driven oscillator has two stable vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. The states have opposite phase and equal amplitudes. An extra drive at half the modulation frequency provides an effective bias that lifts the state symmetry. Quantum fluctuations lead to switching between the states, i.e., to phase-flip transitions. We develop a semiclassical approach that allows us to find the dependence of the switching rates on the amplitude of the bias and the parameters of the modulating field. We find that the rate of switching from a ''shallow'' state can become anomalously small at certain parameter values, leading to an efficient localization in this state. This is a consequence of the change of the topology of the oscillator phase trajectories. The results pave the way for implementing nonreciprocal quantum Ising systems based on parametric oscillators.
