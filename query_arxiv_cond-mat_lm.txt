Title: Giant and Oscillatory Junction Magnetoresistance via RKKY-like Spin Coupling in Spin-Gapless Mn$_2$CoAl/SiO$_2$/p-Si Heterostructures
Authors: Nilay Maji, Subham Mohanty, Pujarani Dehuri
Abstract: Here, we report spin-selective transport and exceptionally large positive junction magnetoresistance (JMR) in sputter-deposited Mn$_2$CoAl/native-SiO$_2$/p-Si heterostructures. Highly ordered inverse-Heusler Mn$_2$CoAl thin films with near-ideal XA chemical ordering ($S \approx 0.97$) and a Curie temperature of $\sim \SI{590}{\kelvin}$ are realized using a magnetron sputtering process. The spin-gapless semiconducting nature of Mn$_2$CoAl is experimentally supported by a weakly temperature-dependent resistivity with a very small negative temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR $\approx -4.2 \times 10^{-9}$~$\si{\ohm\meter\per\kelvin}$) and a nonsaturating linear magnetoresistance over a wide range of magnetic fields and temperatures. A giant positive JMR of $\sim \SI{825}{\percent}$ at \SI{10}{\kelvin} and $\sim \SI{134}{\percent}$ at room temperature is observed despite the presence of only a single ferromagnetic electrode. Systematic variation of the SiO$_2$ tunnel barrier thickness reveals a reproducible oscillatory sign reversal of the JMR accompanied by a monotonic decay in magnitude. This behavior reflects thickness-dependent modulation of spin-selective tunneling mediated by phase-coherent interfacial carriers and can be described phenomenologically by an RKKY-like functional form without invoking conventional metallic exchange interactions. These results identify Mn$_2$CoAl/native-SiO$_2$/p-Si heterostructures as robust and scalable platforms for room-temperature spin-selective transport, with potential applications in semiconductor-compatible spin filters, magnetic field sensors, and reconfigurable spintronic logic elements.

Title: Interacting electrons in silicon quantum interconnects
Authors: Anantha S. Rao, Christopher David White, Sean R. Muleady, Anthony Sigillito, Michael J. Gullans
Abstract: Coherent interconnects between gate-defined silicon quantum processing units are essential for scalable quantum computation and long-range entanglement. We argue that one-dimensional electron channels formed in the silicon quantum well of a Si/SiGe heterostructure exhibit strong Coulomb interactions and realize strongly interacting Luttinger liquid physics. At low electron densities, the system enters a Wigner regime characterized by dominant 4kF correlations; increasing the electron density leads to a crossover from the Wigner regime to a Friedel regime with dominant 2kF correlations. We support these results through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the interacting ground state under both screened and unscreened Coulomb potentials. We propose experimental signatures of the Wigner-Friedel crossover via charge transport and charge sensing in both zero- and high-magnetic field limits. We also analyze the impact of short-range correlated disorder - including random alloy fluctuations and valley splitting variations - and identify that the Wigner-Friedel crossover remains robust until disorder levels of about 400 micro eV. Finally, we show that the Wigner regime enables long-range capacitive coupling between quantum dots across the interconnect, suggesting a route to create long-range entanglement between solid-state qubits. Our results position silicon interconnects as a platform for studying Luttinger liquid physics and for enabling architectures supporting nonlocal quantum error correction and quantum simulation.

Title: Competing Paramagnetic Phases in the Maple-Leaf Heisenberg Antiferromagnet
Authors: P. L. Ebert, Y. Iqbal, A. Wietek
Abstract: We establish a remarkably rich ground state phase diagram in the maple-leaf lattice spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a function of the three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor bonds using exact diagonalization and tower-of-states analysis on clusters up to $N=36$ sites. Besides a hexagonal plaquette state, a star-shaped valence bond solid state is discovered in close vicinity to the (canted) $120^\circ$ magnetic phase, strongly reminiscent of a de-confined critical point or Dirac spin liquid scenario on the triangular lattice antiferromagnets. Moreover, an exact dimer product-state is observed next to a collinear Néel-state, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland model. All identified phases compete in a parameter regime close to the isotropic point, providing a promising region for spin liquids to emerge. By analyzing Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions we identify a sliver of parameter regime where a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid Ansatz is in astonishing agreement with the exact $N=36$ ground state. This rich competition of paramagnetic phases demonstrates that the maple-leaf antiferromagnet is a promising platform for exotic states of matter and quantum critical phenomena.

Title: Spin-triplet paired Wigner crystal stabilized by quantum geometry
Authors: Dmitry Zverevich, Alex Levchenko, Ilya Esterlis
Abstract: We have used variational states to analyze the effects of band geometry on the two-dimensional Wigner crystal with one and two electrons per unit cell. At sufficiently low electron densities, we find that increasing Berry curvature drives a transition into a crystalline state composed of spin-triplet pairs carrying relative orbital angular momentum $m=-1$. The essential features of this transition are captured by an effective two-electron quantum dot problem in the presence of Berry curvature. Our results point to a purely electronic, strong-coupling mechanism for local spin-triplet pairing in correlated two-dimensional electron systems with quantum geometry.

Title: Oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries in Nb and Ta-encapsulated Nb thin films for superconducting qubits

Abstract: We report on atomic-scale analyses of oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) of Nb and Ta-encapsulated Nb (Ta/Nb) thin films for superconducting qubits using atom-probe tomography (APT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We observe oxygen segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) relative to the oxygen concentration within the grains for both Nb and Ta-capped Nb thin films for superconducting qubits and find that higher oxygen concentration in the interior of Nb grains lead to greater oxygen segregation levels at GBs. This finding emphasizes that controlling oxygen impurities in Nb during film deposition and fabrication processing is important to reduce the level of oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb. The enrichment factor (Cgb/Cgrain) for oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb is 2.7 (error bar: 0.3) for Nb films, and Ta-capped Nb thin films exhibit slightly reduced Nb GB enrichment factors of 2.3 (error bar: 0.3) while GBs in the Ta capping layer itself possess higher enrichment factors of 3.0 (error bar: 0.3). We hypothesize that the Ta capping layer can trap oxygen and thereby affect oxygen in-diffusion and segregation at GBs in the underlying Nb thin films. Finally, we find that increases in the oxygen concentration in both Nb grains and GBs correlate with a suppression in the critical temperature for superconductivity (Tc). Together, our comparative chemical and charge transport property analyses provide atomic-scale insights into a potential mechanism contributing to decoherence in superconducting qubits.

Title: Layered CrGe1-xSe3+y with Cr Kagome Lattice and Antiferromagnetic Ordering
Authors: Jeremy G. Philbrick, Chaoguo Wang, Xin Gui, Tai Kong
Abstract: We report the synthesis and properties of a new layered material, CrGe1-xSe3+y. The crystal structure was determined by using single crystal x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. CrGe1-xSe3+y crystallizes with a space group R-3m, featuring a double Kagome layer of chromium atoms, sandwiched between disordered Ge-Se layers. This compound displays antiferromagnetic order below 50 K, unlike the ferromagnetic behavior in CrGeTe3. Chromium displays an effective moment of ~3.9 {\mu}B/Cr, consistent with Cr3+ oxidation. The presence of this phase limits the possibility of a ferromagnetic CrGeSe3 analogous to CrGeTe3.

Title: Emission Dynamics of Rydberg Excitons in $\mathbf{\mathrm{Cu_2O}}$: Distinguishing Second Harmonic Generation from Secondary Emission
Authors: Kerwan Morin, Poulab Chakrabarti, Delphine Lagarde, Maxime Mauguet, Sylwia Zielińska - Raczyńska, David Ziemkiewicz, Xavier Marie, Thomas Boulier
Abstract: Rydberg excitons in $\mathrm{Cu_2O}$ simultaneously give rise to two very different optical responses under resonant two-photon excitation: a coherent second-harmonic signal mediated by the excitonic second order susceptibility tensor $\chi^{(2)}$, and a secondary emission originating from the radiative decay of real exciton populations. Distinguishing these two channels is essential for interpreting nonlinear and quantum-optical experiments based on high-$n$ states, yet their temporal, spectral, and power-dependent signatures often overlap. Here we use time-resolved resonant two-photon excitation to cleanly separate SHG and SE and to map how each depends on $n$, temperature, excitation power, and crystal quality. This approach reveals the markedly different sensitivities of the two processes to phonons, defects, and many-body effects, and establishes practical criteria for identifying SE and SHG in a wide range of experimental conditions. Our results provide a unified framework for interpreting emission from Rydberg excitons and offer guidelines for future studies aiming to exploit their nonlinear response and long-range interactions.

Title: A finite viscoelastic constitutive model for low to high strain rate response of elastomers with application of strain rate-induced glass transition
Authors: Bibekananda Datta, Sushan Nakarmi, Nitin P. Daphalapurkar
Abstract: Amorphous elastomers exhibit significant rate-stiffening and unique viscous flow characteristics across a wide range of strain rates, often undergoing glass transition above a strain rate threshold. We have developed a thermodynamically-consistent and micromechanically-inspired constitutive model for soft elastomeric materials to capture the rate-dependent stress-strain behavior and hysteresis when subjected to low to high strain rates. Our proposed constitutive model encapsulates the viscous flow of materials through molecular motion at low strain rates and local rearrangement and alignment at high strain rates, essentially covering the glass transition. We applied our constitutive model to uniaxial compression experiments performed at low and high strain rates for polyborosiloxane (PBS) to identify the material parameters, and subsequently, performed numerical simulations of single and multi-cycle compression, stress relaxation, and small amplitude oscillatory tension-compression. Our analyses indicate that the model predicts higher total energy dissipation with increasing strain rate; however, dissipation associated with molecular relaxation decreases (forming a cusp) because, beyond a crossover strain rate, molecular rearrangement and alignment become dominant, which is consistent with the onset of the glass transition. For cyclic loading-unloading, we observed that dissipation over a cycle remains constant at low strain rate but decreases non-monotonically at high strain rates before becoming constant with peak stress over the cycle becoming higher, which can be interpreted as more loading being carried elastically by the polymer network as the molecular rearrangement process occurs. Additionally, our model was able to predict the qualitative nature of the storage modulus and loss modulus in the limit of small strain over a wide range of frequency sweeps.

Title: Magnetic switching of exciton lifetime in CrSBr

Abstract: Exciton dynamics in layered magnetic semiconductors provide a sensitive probe of the interplay between spin order and light-matter interaction. Here, we study thin CrSBr layers using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy in an external magnetic field, revealing a step-like reduction in the exciton lifetime from 11 to 7 ps, during the magnetization flip from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase. The reduction of the exciton lifetime in the ferromagnetic phase persists below the Néel temperature, as evidenced by its strong magnetic-field dependence that disappears in the paramagnetic phase. Ab initio calculations reveal a one-dimensional nature of free excitons accompanied by a pronounced change in the oscillator strength across the magnetic phase transition predicting a shorter radiative lifetime of free excitons in the antiferromagnetic phase of CrSBr contradicting the experimental observations. This discrepancy is explained by strong localization of excitons at low tempature. We show both experimentally and theoretically that the observed magnetic switching of the exciton lifetime is attributed to a larger exciton localization volume leading to a larger oscillator strength in the ferromagnetic phase. The results show that disorder-induced localization effects play a key role in exciton dynamics in CrSBr.

Title: Multi-resonant non-dispersive infrared gas sensing: breaking the selectivity and sensitivity tradeoff
Authors: Emma R. Bartelsen, J. Ryan Nolen, Christopher R. Gubbin, Mingze He, Ryan W. Spangler, Joshua Nordlander, Katja Diaz-Granados, Simone De Liberato, Jon-Paul Maria, James R. McBride, Joshua D. Caldwell
Abstract: In applications such as atmospheric monitoring of greenhouse gases and pollutants, the detection and identification of trace concentrations of harmful gases is commonly achieved using non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors. These devices employ a broadband infrared emitter, thermopile detector, and a spectrally selective bandpass filter tuned to the vibrational resonance of the target analyte. However, the fabrication of these filters is costly and limited to a single frequency. This limitation introduces a fundamental tradeoff, as broadening the optical passband width enhances sensitivity but compromises selectivity, whereas narrowing improves selectivity at the expense of sensitivity. In this work, we validate a filterless NDIR approach using a multi-peak thermal emitter developed through inverse design. This emitter enhances detection sensitivity by targeting multiple absorption bands, demonstrated through the creation of a sensor designed for the C-H vibrational modes of propane. Additionally, a set of single-peak emitters were developed to showcase the capability of designing highly selective sensors operating within close spectral proximity. These emitters, targeting the stretching modes of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, exhibit Q-factors above 50 and minimal crosstalk, enabling accurate detection of the target gas without interference from gases with spectrally adjacent absorption bands. This is enabled by the implementation of an aperiodic distributed Bragg reflectors, which allows for higher Q-factors with fewer layers than a periodic Bragg reflector using the same materials and number of layers, thereby reducing fabrication complexity and cost. Experimental results validate that this approach breaks the tradeoff between sensitivity and selectivity. This work highlights the potential of optimized thermal emitters for more efficient and compact gas sensing applications.

Title: The effect of normal stress on stacking fault energy in face-centered cubic metals
Authors: Yang Li, Yuri Mishin
Abstract: Plastic deformation and fracture of FCC metals involve the formation of stable or unstable stacking faults (SFs) on (111) plane. Examples include dislocation cross-slip and dislocation nucleation at interfaces and near crack tips. The stress component normal to (111) plane can strongly affect the SF energy when the stress magnitude reaches several to tens of GPa. We conduct a series of DFT calculations of SF energies in six FCC metals: Al, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au, and Pt. The results show that normal compression significantly increases the stable and unstable SF energies in all six metals, while normal tension decreases them. The SF formation is accompanied by inelastic expansion in the normal direction. The DFT calculations are compared with predictions of several representative classical and machine-learning interatomic potentials. Many potentials fail to capture the correct stress effect on the SF energy, often predicting trends opposite to the DFT calculations. Possible ways to improve the ability of potentials to represent the stress effect on SF energy are discussed.

Title: Coupled Spin-lattice Dynamics across a Magnetostructural Phase Transition
Authors: Lokanath Patra, Zeyu Xiang, Yubi Chen, Bolin Liao
Abstract: First-order magnetostructural phase transitions underpin giant magnetocaloric effects, yet the microscopic role of lattice dynamics in these transitions remains controversial. Here we use first-principles spin-lattice dynamics simulations to investigate the coupled evolution of magnetization and phonon dispersions across the magnetostructural transition in MnAs. Our simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimentally observed Curie temperature, lattice contraction, and free-energy crossing between hexagonal and orthorhombic phases. We show that below the Curie temperature, magnetic-field-induced hardening of soft phonon modes gives rise to a sizable lattice entropy contribution that enhances the total isothermal entropy change by approximately 23% under a 5 T field. In contrast, the lattice entropy change associated with the structural phase transition itself has an opposite sign and partially compensates the lattice contribution due to field-induced phonon hardening. This competition reconciles long-standing discrepancies in the interpretation of magnetocaloric entropy measurements across first-order transitions. In addition, we demonstrate that the strong magnetic-field dependence of the phonon spectrum near the transition enables large tunability of lattice thermal conductivity, highlighting MnAs as a promising platform for magnetic-field-controlled thermal switching. Our results establish a unified microscopic picture of spin-lattice coupling in first-order magnetocaloric materials and provide design principles for engineering enhanced caloric and thermal transport functionalities.

Title: Symmetry-engineered and electrically tunable in-plane anomalous Hall effect in oxide heterostructures
Authors: Kunjie Dai, Zhen Wang, Wenfeng Wu, Feng Jin, Enda Hua, Nan Liu, Jingdi Lu, Jinfeng Zhang, Yuyue Zhao, Linda Yang, Kai Liu, Huan Ye, Qiming Lv, Zhengguo Liang, Ao Wang, Dazhi Hou, Yang Gao, Shengchun Shen, Jing Tao, Liang Si, Wenbin Wu, Lingfei Wang
Abstract: The family of Hall effects has long served as a premier probe of how symmetry, magnetic order, and topology intertwine in solids. Recently, the in-plane anomalous Hall effect (IP-AHE), a transverse Hall response driven by in-plane magnetization, has emerged as a distinct member of this family, offering innovative spintronic functionalities and illuminating intricate interplay between mirror-symmetry breaking and in-plane magnetic order. However, practical routes to deterministically and reversibly control IP-AHE remain limited. Here, we establish a symmetry-engineered IP-AHE platform, CaRuO3/La2/3Ca1/3MnO3/CaRuO3 heterostructure on NdGaO3(110), that turns strict mirror-symmetry breaking constraints into effective tuning knobs. IP-AHE in these epitaxial trilayers unambiguously couples to the CaRuO3-buffer-induced mirror-symmetry breaking and faithfully reproduces the ferromagnetic hysteresis. Ionic liquid gating further enables reversible reconfigurations of the symmetry breaking, thereby achieving electrical modulation and ON/OFF switching of IP-AHE. This highly tunable IP-AHE platform opens pathways for exploring nontrivial magnetic order and developing programmable Hall functionalities in planar geometries.

Title: Intertwined atomic-nanoscale-microscale structures via intralayer anisotropic Fe-chains in the layered ferromagnet FePd2Te2
Authors: Manyu Wang, Chang Li, Bingxian Shi, Shuo Mi, Xiaoxiao Pei, Shuming Meng, Yanyan Geng, Fei Pang, Rui Xu, Li Huang, Wei Ji, Hong-Jun Gao, Peng Cheng, Le Lei, Zhihai Cheng
Abstract: Controlling mesoscale and nanoscale material structures and properties through self-organized atomic behavior is essential for atomic-scale manufacturing. However, direct and visual studies on the cross-scale effects of such atomic self-organization on mesoscopic structures remain scarce. Here, we report the intertwined atomic-nanoscale-mesoscale structures via the intralayer Fe-chains in the sandwich-like layered FePd2Te2 crystal by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The hierarchical orthogonal corrugated morphologies are directly revealed and attributed to its chain-orientation-determined twinning-domain effect. Both Fe-chains of middle-sublayer and two kinds of Te atoms of top-sublayer are further atomically resolved at the sub-Å level, indicating the critical effects of Pd-atoms/voids on the intra-layer anisotropic Fe-chains and the interlayer structural alignment. The thermal-induced and strain-related structural transitions of surface layer are further investigated and discussed based on the proposed filling model of Pd-voids by the intralayer Pd-atoms. Our work not only provides deep understanding of this exotic layered magnetic material, and will inspire more perspectives for tailoring its anisotropic atomic-to-mesoscale structures and properties.

Title: Revival of Strain Susceptibilities: Magnetostrictive Coefficient and Thermal-Expansion Coefficient
Authors: Yisheng Chai
Abstract: In thermodynamics, volume is an essential extensive variable. Strain-line, area, or volume change-therefore offers a direct window into correlated quantum matter: tiny length changes {\Delta}L track how the lattice responds when state variables such as magnetic field H and/or temperature T are varied, revealing phases, transitions, and dynamics. Direct, high-precision strain measurements are already difficult; their susceptibilities are harder still. Very recently, several direct techniques have made vital progress on two key quantities: the magnetostrictive coefficient d{\lambda}/dH (often denoted qijk or dij in the magnetostriction literatures), and the linear thermal-expansion coefficient {\alpha}= d{\lambda}/dT. Considering these two strain susceptibilities together-they are fundamental and complementary-clarifies why these thermodynamic properties merit renewed attention.

Title: Anomalously High Phonon Thermal Conductivity Driven by Weak Electron-Phonon Coupling in Weyl Semimetals TaAs and TaP
Authors: Xianyong Ding, Xin Jin, Dengfeng Li, Jing Fan, Peng Yu, Xiaoyuan Zhou, Xiaolong Yang, Rui Wang
Abstract: In conventional metals, thermal transport is governed by electrons, with phonon contributions often considered negligible. Here, through rigorous first-principles calculations, we uncover a phonon-dominated thermal transport regime in the Weyl semimetals TaAs and TaP. Remarkably, although TaP is metallic, its phonon thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\text{ph}}$) reaches as high as 171 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, surpassing its electronic counterpart by more than a factor of five. This anomalously high $\kappa_{\text{ph}}$ is enabled by the unique electronic and phononic band structures, characterized by the Weyl nodes near the Fermi level, together with acoustic phonon bunching and a wide frequency gap in the phonon spectrum, which collectively suppress phonon-electron and phonon-phonon scattering processes. Due to the substantial phonon contribution, the derived Lorenz number deviates strongly from the conventional Wiedemann-Franz law. We further show that the significance of phonon thermal transport is universal across topological semimetals. Our work provides deeper insight into thermal transport mechanisms in topological semimetals and extends the scope for discovering materials with high thermal conductivity.

Title: Autonomous Probe Microscopy with Robust Bag-of-Features Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization: Pareto-Front Mapping of Nanoscale Structure-Property Trade-Offs
Authors: Kamyar Barakati, Haochen Zhu, C Charlotte Buchanan, Dustin A Gilbert, Philip Rack, Sergei V. Kalinin
Abstract: Combinatorial materials libraries are an efficient route to generate large families of candidate compositions, but their impact is often limited by the speed and depth of characterization and by the difficulty of extracting actionable structure-property relations from complex characterization data. Here we develop an autonomous scanning probe microscopy (SPM) framework that integrates automated atomic force and magnetic force microscopy (AFM/MFM) to rapidly explore magnetic and structural properties across combinatorial spread libraries. To enable automated exploration of systems without a clear optimization target, we introduce a combination of a static physics-informed bag-of-features (BoF) representation of measured surface morphology and magnetic structure with multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to discover the relative significance and robustness of features. The resulting closed-loop workflow selectively samples the compositional gradient and reconstructs feature landscapes consistent with dense grid "ground truth" measurements. The resulting Pareto structure reveals where multiple nanoscale objectives are simultaneously optimized, where trade-offs between roughness, coherence, and magnetic contrast are unavoidable, and how families of compositions cluster into distinct functional regimes, thereby turning multi-feature imaging data into interpretable maps of competing structure-property trends. While demonstrated for Au-Co-Ni and AFM/MFM, the approach is general and can be extended to other combinatorial systems, imaging modalities, and feature sets, illustrating how feature-based MOBO and autonomous SPM can transform microscopy images from static data products into active feedback for real-time, multi-objective materials discovery.

Title: Cross-hatch strain effects on SiGe quantum dots for qubit variability estimation
Authors: Luis Fabián Peña, Mitchell I. Brickson, Fabrizio Rovaris, J. Houston Dycus, Anthony McDonald, Zachary T. Piontkowski, Joel Benjamin Ruzindana, Adelaide M. Bradicich, Don Bethke, Robin Scott, Thomas E. Beechem, Francesco Montalenti, N. Tobias Jacobson, Ezra Bussmann
Abstract: SiGe heterostructures integrated with Si via virtual substrate (VS) growth are promising hosts for spin qubits. While VS growth targets plastic relaxation, residual cross-hatch strain inhomogeneity propagates into heterostructure overgrowth. To quantify strain inhomogeneity's influence on interface structure and qubit properties, we measure strained-silicon (s-Si)/Si$_{0.7}$Ge$_{0.3}$ heterostructures on 25 wafers processed via standard commercial chemical vapor deposition. Spatially-aligned images of strain (Raman microscopy) and interface structure (atomic force microscopy and cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy) reveal strain-roughness interplay. A strain-driven surface diffusion model predicts the roughness and its temperature dependence. Measured strains suggest spurious double-dot qubit detunings of 0.1 meV over 100 nm distances may result. Modeling shows that interface roughness (atomic steps), when convolved with alloy disorder, only modestly reduces valley splitting (70$\pm$13 vs. 77$\pm$14 $\mu$eV on average). Our findings point to thicker VS buffer layers beneath heterostructures and lower-temperature growth (T $\le$ 700 $^{\circ}$C) to limit roughening.

Title: Molecular Orbital Degeneracy Lifting in a Tetrahedral Cluster System NbSeI
Authors: Keita Kojima, Youichi Yamakawa, Ryutaro Okuma, Shunsuke Kitou, Hayato Takano, Jun-ichi Yamaura, Yusuke Tokunaga, Taka-hisa Arima, Yoshihiko Okamoto
Abstract: The lifting of degenerate electronic states, in which multiple electronic states share the same energy, is a fundamental issue in the physics of crystalline solids. In real materials, this problem has been extensively studied in transition metal compounds, where various quantum phenomena arise from the spin and orbital degeneracy of the d electrons on individual transition-metal atoms. In contrast, materials containing high-symmetry clusters composed of multiple transition-metal atoms are expected to exhibit more emergent phenomena due to the entanglement of the electronic degrees of freedom across multiple atoms. Here, we report the discovery of two distinct mechanisms of orbital-degeneracy lifting in NbSeI, which comprises Nb4 tetrahedral clusters with molecular orbital degrees of freedom and whose average crystal structure is predicted to host a flat-band metal. Below 106 K, NbSeI is found to be a nonmagnetic molecular orbital-ordered insulator. Above this temperature, the average structure becomes face-centered cubic without any superlattice, while the orbital degeneracy remains lifted by significant local distortions of Nb4 tetrahedra, which may be associated with a molecular orbital-liquid or orbital-frozen state. This noncooperative Jahn-Teller distortion stabilizes a nonmagnetic insulating state above 106 K, in stark contrast to the flat-band metal predicted from the average structure.

Title: Pattern formation in driven condensates
Authors: Kiryang Kwon, Jae-yoon Choi
Abstract: Spontaneous pattern formation out of homogeneous media is one of the well-understood examples of hydrodynamic instabilities in classical systems, which naturally leads to the question of its manifestation in quantum fluids. Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of atomic gases have been an ideal platform for studying many-body quantum phenomena, such as superfluidity, and simultaneously providing an opportunity to broaden our understanding of classical hydrodynamics into quantum systems. In this review, we introduce a range of experimental studies on the pattern formation in quantum fluids of atomic gases under external driving, including Faraday waves in one and two dimensions, surface patterns, and counterflow instabilities in a mixture of superfluids. The pattern formation in the quantum system can be understood through the parametric amplification process, where an unstable dynamical mode can be exponentially amplified, similar to classical systems. Remarkably, the governing equations for surface excitations of trapped BECs can be mathematically equivalent to those of shallow water, indicating a universal description of the hydrodynamic instability across classical and quantum domains. However, the condensates, as superfluids, also possess fundamental quantum characteristics, such as quantized vorticity and a distinct dissipation channel. These unique features showcase many-body fragmentation under strong modulation and the generation of vortices in the nonlinear regime, which could offer a pathway to the study of quantum turbulence. Furthermore, the coexistence of long-range phase coherence and density modulation in driven condensates could provide unexplored features, such as those seen in supersolid-like sound modes, within nonequilibrium settings.

Title: Autonomous Discovery of the Ising Model's Critical Parameters with Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Hai Man, Chaobo Wang, Jia-Rui Li, Yuping Tian, Shu-Gang Chen
Abstract: Traditional methods for determining critical parameters are often influenced by human factors. This research introduces a physics-inspired adaptive reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to autonomously interact with physical environments, simultaneously identifying both the critical temperature and various types of critical exponents in the Ising model with precision. Interestingly, our algorithm exhibits search behavior reminiscent of phase transitions, efficiently converging to target parameters regardless of initial conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms traditional approaches, particularly in environments with strong perturbations. This study not only incorporates physical concepts into machine learning to enhance algorithm interpretability but also establishes a new paradigm for scientific exploration, transitioning from manual analysis to autonomous AI discovery.

Title: Symmetry-Driven Unconventional Magnetoelectric Coupling in Perovskite Altermagnets: From Bulk to the Two-Dimensional Limit
Authors: Zhou Cui, Ziye Zhu, Xunkai Duan, Bowen Hao, Xianzhang Chen, Jiayong Zhang, Tong Zhou
Abstract: The emergence of altermagnets establishes a new paradigm for multiferroics. Unlike conventional multiferroics relying on direct magnetoelectric coupling, multiferroic altermagnets host a crystal-symmetry-mediated magnetoelectric interaction that is intrinsically more efficient and robust. Among candidate material platforms, layered perovskites are particularly appealing owing to their structural diversity and synthetic versatility. However, magnetoelectric properties at the two-dimensional scale remain largely unexplored, hindering their applicability in miniaturized, highly integrated devices. Here, we systematically investigate the dimensional evolution of ferroelectric polarization and magnetism in perovskite systems through symmetry analysis. We demonstrate that altermagnetism can persist in the two-dimensional limit, yet is strongly constrained by the magnetic configuration-with only C-type antiferromagnetic order supporting it. Based on mode-decomposition calculations, we further reveal that symmetry-restricted multimode couplings simultaneously govern ferroelectric polarization and altermagnetic spin splitting. Finally, combined with first-principles calculations, we propose several strategies to lift the magnetic-configuration constraint, extending the range of viable altermagnetic systems. These results underscore the critical role of dimensionality in symmetry-driven magnetoelectric coupling in perovskite altermagnets and pave the way toward next-generation electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.

Title: Precipitate size evolution in an ultrafine-grained magnesium-manganese alloy
Authors: Julian M. Rosalie, Brian R. Pauw, Anton Hohenwarter
Abstract: Precipitate size evolution during room temperature high-pressure torsion (HPT) of a Mg-1.35wt.%Mn alloy was studied using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and Small-/Wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS). The volume fraction of the nm-scale $\alpha$-Mn particles increased with applied strain, however small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) indicated that the majority of manganese remained in solution even after 10 HPT rotations, indicating that the reaction progress is still limited by the diffusivity of Mn. Analysis of the precipitate size distribution determined that the mean particle size did not increase over the course of HPT. This, in combination with the precipitate size distribution suggested that precipitate growth was subject to interfacial rather than diffusional control.

Title: Observation of Unconventional Ferroelectricity in Non-Moir'\e Graphene on Hexagonal Boron Nitride Boundaries and Interfaces
Authors: Tianyu Zhang, Yueyang Wang, Hongxia Xue, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Dong-Keun Ki
Abstract: Interfacial interactions in two parallel-stacked hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) layers facilitate sliding ferroelectricity, enabling novel device functionalities. Additionally, when Bernal or twisted bilayer graphene is aligned with an hBN layer, unconventional ferroelectric behavior was observed, though its precise origin remains unclear. Here, we propose an alternative approach to engineering such an unconventional ferroelectricity in graphene-hBN van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures by creating specific types of hBN boundaries and interfaces. We found that the unconventional ferroelectricity can occur--without the alignments at graphene-hBN or hBN-hBN interfaces--when there are hBN edges or interfaces with line defects. By systematically analyzing the gate dependence of mobile and localized charges, we identified key characteristics of localized states that underlie the observed unconventional ferroelectricity, informing future studies. These findings highlight the complexity of the interfacial interactions in graphene/hBN systems, and demonstrate the potential for defect engineering in vdW heterostructures.

Title: Molecular signatures of pressure-induced phase transitions in a lipid bilayer
Authors: Yanna Gautier, Guillaume Stirnemann, Jérôme Hénin
Abstract: Understanding how lipid bilayers respond to pressure is essential for interpreting the coupling between membrane proteins and their native environments. Here, we use all-atom molecular dynamics to examine the pressure-temperature behavior of model membranes composed of DMPC or $\Delta$9-cis-PC. Within the studied range (288-308 K, 1-2000 bar), DMPC undergoes a liquid--gel transition, while $\Delta$9-cis-PC remains fluid due to unsaturation. The CHARMM36 force field reproduces experimental boundaries with high fidelity: simulated DMPC transitions deviate by only 5-10 K and 100-300 bar, and $\Delta$9-cis-PC exhibits no transition. Hysteresis is modest but most pronounced when starting from low-temperature gels. We identify area per lipid, bilayer thickness, and acyl-chain gauche fraction as sensitive phase markers; among these, the gauche fraction provides the most robust signature. Simulations indicate an interdigitated gel is the equilibrium structure under finite-size conditions. However, at low temperature and high pressure, interdigitation decreases, consistent with the experimental lamellar gel phase. This long-lived interdigitation critically impacts standard order parameters, specifically area per lipid and membrane thickness. These results underscore the accuracy of modern force fields and highlight how simulations mechanistically complement experimental studies of pressure-regulated membranes.

Title: NiTi Single Crystal Growth by Micro-Pulling-Down Method: Experimental Setup and Material Characterization

Abstract: Nickel-titanium that has an austenite to martensite phase transition has been studied extensively in the past as a shape memory alloy, but a lot remains to be learned from such phase transitions. However, single crystals are needed for a detailed characterization of the emerging phase transition. In order to produce NiTi single crystals for research purposes, we have set up a micro-pulling-down ($\mu$PD) apparatus. The $\mu$PD process is a fast and flexible method for the fabrication of small single crystals. The apparatus is operated in vacuum. By pulling the crystal down through a hole in the crucible bottom, it is possible to reduce oxygen contamination, since oxides float on top of the melt due to their low density. Here we present a detailed characterization of as-grown NiTi crystals by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), hot gas extraction method and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The characteristics of the phase transition in NiTi are very sensitive to dopants and alloying. The $\mu$PD method facilitates the introduction of different doping elements into the crystal.

Title: Exact Theory of Fermi-Energy Response at Metallic Interfaces
Authors: Théophane Bernhard, Andrea Grisafi
Abstract: The response of the Fermi energy to external perturbations governs key physical observables at metallic interfaces. Although this response admits a local formulation in terms of the Fukui function, its evaluation has traditionally been limited by inherent approximations, fundamentally rooted in the difficulty of adding a finite charge in a periodic system. We present an exact resolution to this problem that leverages the screening properties of electronic conductors to compute Fukui functions via a finite electric field. The resulting linear-response theory yields strictly quadratic error scaling of Fermi-level shifts across representative platinum surfaces, achieving sub-meV accuracy up to fields of 0.1 V/Å. The approach is further validated by reproducing work-function changes under molecular perturbations, and by providing mean-field estimates of electrode potentials that yield capacitance--voltage curves consistent with experiment. Our findings establish a rigorous foundation for a local theory relating electrostatic screening and Fermi-energy variations at metallic interfaces.

Title: Topological Superconductivity in Altermagnetic Heterostructures on a Honeycomb Lattice
Authors: George McArdle, Brian Kiraly, Peter Wadley, Adam Gammon-Smith
Abstract: Altermagnet-superconductor heterostructures have been shown, in principle, to provide a route towards realising topological superconductivity, and therefore host topologically protected boundary states. In this work we demonstrate that the topological states observed are dependent on the structure of the underlying lattice. By deriving and analysing a model on a honeycomb lattice, we demonstrate that the topological phase diagram has a rich structure containing both chiral edge modes and Majorana corner modes, the latter of which are an indication of higher-order topology. We analyse the effect of disorder on these states and find that whilst the edge modes are robust to a disordered system, any potential observation of the corner modes may be sensitive to the microscopic details. In particular, we show that vacancies can lead to other low energy bound states that may be difficult to distinguish from the corner modes.

Title: Joint Optimization of Neural Autoregressors via Scoring rules
Authors: Jonas Landsgesell
Abstract: Non-parametric distributional regression has achieved significant milestones in recent years. Among these, the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted Network (TabPFN) has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. However, a challenge remains in extending these grid-based approaches to a truly multivariate setting. In a naive non-parametric discretization with $N$ bins per dimension, the complexity of an explicit joint grid scales exponentially and the paramer count of the neural networks rise sharply. This scaling is particularly detrimental in low-data regimes, as the final projection layer would require many parameters, leading to severe overfitting and intractability.

Title: First-principles analysis of in-plane anomalous Hall effect using symmetry-adapted Wannier Hamiltonians and multipole decomposition
Authors: Hiroto Saito, Takashi Koretsune
Abstract: The in-plane anomalous Hall effect occurs when magnetization lies within the same plane as the electric field and Hall current, and requires magnetic point groups lacking rotational or mirror symmetries. While it is observed in both Weyl semimetals and elemental ferromagnets, the microscopic role of higher-order multipoles remains unclear. Here, we develop a microscopic framework that combines time-reversal-symmetric Wannier functions with a symmetry-adapted multipole basis to decompose the first-principles Wannier Hamiltonian into electric, magnetic, magnetic toroidal, and electric toroidal multipoles. This approach allows us to rotate the magnetization rank by rank and quantify how each multipole affects the conductivity. Applying this framework to body-centered cubic iron, we find that high-rank magnetic and magnetic toroidal multipoles contribute with magnitudes comparable to magnetic dipoles, while magnetic toroidal 16-poles act with the opposite sign. Furthermore, based on this multipole analysis, we apply uniaxial strain along the [103] direction to control the dominant multipoles contributing to the conductivity. The strain substantially modifies its angular dependence, demonstrating that multipole-resolved Hamiltonian engineering and magnetoelastic control serve as practical routes to predict and tune the in-plane anomalous Hall conductivity in simple ferromagnets.

Title: Quantized heat flow in the Hofstadter butterfly

Abstract: When subjected to a strong magnetic field, electrons on a two-dimensional lattice acquire a fractal energy spectrum called Hofstadter's butterfly. In addition to its unique recursive structure, the Hofstadter butterfly is intimately linked to non-trivial topological orders, hosting a cascade of ground states characterized by non-zero topological invariants. These states, called Chern insulators, are usually understood as replicas of the ground states of the quantum Hall effect, with electrical and thermal conductances that should be quantized, reflecting their topological order. The Hofstadter butterfly is now commonly observed in van-der-Waals heterostructures-based moiré superlattices. However, its thermal properties, particularly the quantized heat flow expected in the Chern insulators, have not been investigated, potentially questioning their similarity with standard quantum Hall states. Here we probe the heat transport properties of the Hofstadter butterfly, obtained in a graphene~/~hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattice. We observe a quantized heat flow, uniquely set by the topological invariant, for all investigated states of the Hofstadter butterfly: quantum Hall states, Chern insulators, and even symmetry-broken Chern insulators emerging from strong electronic interactions. Our work firmly establishes the universality of the quantization of heat transport and its intimate link with topology.

Title: Mechanical control of magnetic exchange and response in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$: A computational study
Authors: Sagar Sarkar, Rohit Pathak, Arnob Mukherjee, Anna Delin, Olle Eriksson, Vladislav Borisov
Abstract: We present a systematic computational study of the effect of uniaxial strain on the magnetic properties of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, a centrosymmetric material known to host a field-induced skyrmion lattice (SkL). Using first-principles density functional theory, we first demonstrate the pronounced sensitivity of the exchange and anisotropy to specific structural distortions. These DFT-derived interactions are then integrated into a classical spin model to construct comprehensive magnetic phase diagrams under both compressive and tensile strain. Our key finding is that compressive strain ($\sim 2\%$) acts as an effective tuning parameter, substantially expanding the stability region of the $\vec Q_{100}$-driven topologically nontrivial phases. This results from the shifts in the critical magnetic fields and enhancement of the energy scale of the favored magnetic wave vector. In contrast, tensile strain induces a different magnetic ground-state by promoting a different magnetic ordering vector, $\vec Q_{110}$, leading to entirely distinct phase behavior. This work not only provides a quantitative understanding of the structural-magnetic coupling in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ but also establishes strain engineering as a powerful approach to control and optimize topologically non-trivial magnetic phases in centrosymmetric magnets.

Title: Unraveling the effects of anionic vacancies and temperature on mechanical properties of NbC and NbN: Insights from Quantum Mechanical Study
Authors: P.W. Muchiri, K. K. Korir, N. W. Makau, M. O. Atambo, G. O. Amolo
Abstract: Transition metal carbides and nitrides (TMCNs), such as niobium carbide (NbC) and niobium nitride (NbN), are of great technological interest due to their exceptional hardness, high melting points, and thermal stability. While previous studies have focused on their groundstate properties (at 0 K), limited information exists on their mechanical behavior under realistic operational conditions involving elevated temperatures and the presence of defects. In this study, we employ ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the effects of temperature (300 to 1500 K) and anionic vacancies on the mechanical properties of NbC and NbN in rocksalt (RS), zincblende (ZB), and wurtzite (WZ) structures. The results reveal a nonlinear decrease in elastic constants, bulk, shear, and Youngs moduli with both increasing temperature and defect concentration. Hardness and toughness analyses, based on Pughs ratio and Poisson ratio, show ductility and brittleness transitions that are sensitive to structure, defect level, and thermal effects. Furthermore, vacancy migration energies computed using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method demonstrate strong structural dependence, with RS exhibiting the highest barriers and WZ the lowest. These findings provide new insights into the defect and temperature interplay in NbC and NbN, offering guidelines for their optimization in high-temperature and wear-resistant applications.

Title: On the Novel Superfluidity in the Second Layer of $^4$He on Graphite
Authors: Jun Usami, Hiroshi Fukuyama
Abstract: Evidence for a new type of superfluid phase in second-layer $^4$He on graphite has been obtained from simultaneous measurements of torsional-oscillator response and heat-capacity on exactly the same sample down to 30 mK, which resolve substrate-related uncertainties in the previous studies. The new phase hosts both superfluidity and enhanced viscoelasticity, and is stable over a finite density interval, strongly supporting the proposed superfluid liquid-crystal hypothesis. A random-Josephson-network analysis shows that the widely reported log-$T$ dependence of the superfluid density is likely due to substrate imperfections.

Title: Observation of magnon torques mediated by orbital hybridization at the light metal/antiferromagnetic insulator interface
Authors: Yuchen Pu, Guoyi Shi, Hua Bai, Xinhou Chen, Chenhui Zhang, Zhaohui Li, Mehrdad Elyasi, Hyunsoo Yang
Abstract: Magnon torques, which can operate without involving moving electrons, could circumvent the Joule heating issue. In conventional magnon torque systems, the spin source layer with strong spin-orbit coupling is utilized to inject magnons, and the efficiency is limited by the inherent spin Hall conductivity of the spin source layer. In this work, we observe magnon torques in the Cr/NiO/ferromagnet heterostructure with the effective spin Hall conductivity of 2.45x10^5 hbar/(2e{\Omega}m), twice that of the best conventional magnon torque system. We demonstrate the magnon-torque-driven switching of a perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB layer at room temperature, with a switching power consumption density of 0.136 mW/{\mu}m^2. We find that the magnon torque originates from the orbital hybridization and interfacial inversion symmetry breaking at the Cr/NiO interface. Our findings not only significantly enhance the efficiency of magnon torques, but also provide key insights into the fundamental mechanisms of magnon injections.

Authors: Lassaad Mandhour, Frédéric Piéchon
Abstract: We investigate the scattering of a three-dimensional massless Dirac particle through a domain wall separating two regions with identical energy spectra but distinct Berry curvature dipoles. We demonstrate that the quantum geometric mismatch induces partial reflection and transmission despite identical incident and refracted momenta. These results highlight the role of engineered quantum geometric interfaces as key tools to control Dirac particle scattering.

Title: Spin dynamics of excitons and carriers in mixed-cation MA$_{x}$FA$_{1-x}$PbI$_{3}$ perovskite crystals: alloy fluctuations probed by optical orientation
Authors: B. F. Gribakin, N. E. Kopteva, D. R. Yakovlev, I. A. Akimov, I. V. Kalitukha, B. Turedi, M. V. Kovalenko, M. Bayer
Abstract: Optical spin orientation measured by time-resolved photoluminescence provides a powerful tool to probe the spin dynamics of excitons and charge carriers in perovskite semiconductors. The impact of alloy fluctuations on the spin dynamics of mixed-cation \MAFAPI{} perovskite single crystals is studied here experimentally. The optical orientation is measured under nonresonant excitation for crystals with $x = 0.1$, $0.4$, and $0.8$ at cryogenic temperatures and compared with data on \MAPI{} crystals. The high degree of exciton optical orientation of $75-80$\% for $x = 0.1$ and $0.8$ reduces to about 60\% for $x = 0.4$. A similar trend is observed for the carrier spin optical orientation. This behavior is attributed to enhanced scattering of free excitons and carriers in the alloys with increased compositional and structural disorder. From the Larmor spin precession measured from spin dynamics in an external magnetic field applied in the Voigt geometry, the electron and hole $g$-factors are evaluated. Their dependence on the band gap energy in \MAFAPI{} crystals follows the universal trend previously established for lead halide perovskites.

Title: Bio-resorbable magnetic tunnel junctions
Authors: Dong-Jun Kim, Beom Jin Kim, Hee-Chang Shin, Jeongkeun Kim, Yuchen Pu, Shuhan Yang, Xinhou Chen, Byong-Guk Park, Jong-Hyun Ahn, Hyunsoo Yang
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) play a crucial role in spintronic applications, particularly data storage and sensors. Especially as a non-volatile memory, MTJs have received substantial attention due to its CMOS compatibility, low power consumption, fast switching speed, and high endurance. In parallel, bio-resorbable electronics have emerged as a promising solution for systems requiring temporary operation and secure data disposal, especially in military, intelligence, and biomedical systems where devices must safely disintegrate under physiological conditions. In this study, we investigate the bio-resorbability of MTJ by analyzing the dissolution behavior of its nanometer-thick constituent layers in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at pH 7.4, simulating physiological environments. The MTJ structures, composed of bio-resorbable materials, exhibit well-controlled degradation behaviors. Critically, as one of the ferromagnetic layers dissolves, binary information is irreversibly lost, within 10 hours of immersion. These findings highlight the potential of MTJs not only as high-performance memory elements but also as secure, transient data storage platforms. The ability to modify the dissolution lifetime by materials and thickness selection offers unique advantages for short-lived implantable devices, paving the way for integrating spintronic functionality into next-generation bioresorbable electronics.

Title: Structural and magnetic properties of co-sputtered epitaxial Fe-Sn kagome thin films
Authors: Callum Brennan-Rich, Sean M. Collins, Stuart Micklethwaite, Zabeada Aslam, Trevor Almeida, Stephen McVitie, Rik M. Drummond-Brydson, Christopher H. Marrows
Abstract: In recent years the intermetallic alloys of Fe and Sn have gained significant interest due to a rich variety of magnetic properties present in these materials. The crystal Fe3Sn2 is a frustrated ferromagnet, while the crystallographically similar FeSn, which differs only by the stacking sequence of its Fe-containining kagome and stanene layers, is an antiferromagnet. Thin-film growth techniques such as magnetron sputtering allow for these different stoichiometric compositions to be grown through adjustments of the rate of deposition of the individual Fe and Sn sources, while all other conditions remain constant. Here, we report the production of high quality epitaxial thin films of Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ and FeSn on sapphire with a Pt seed layer, as well as a mixed phase containing intergrowths of both crystals, all of which we have characterized using both X-ray and four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) methods. The resulting crystallographic phase content is compared to the results of magnetization measurements, with correspondence between the predicted ferromagnetic phase content and the resulting magnetization. Further magnetic properties of these films can then also be compared, leading to the discovery of a unique behavior in the temperature dependent coercivity within highly mixed phase alloys, a feature that is absent in either pure Fe3Sn2 and FeSn.

Title: Crystalline-dependent magnon torques in all-sputtered Hf/Cr2O3/ferromagnet heterostructures
Authors: Yuchen Pu, Guoyi Shi, Chenhui Zhang, Xinhou Chen, Hanbum Park, Hyunsoo Yang
Abstract: Electron motion in spin-orbit torque devices inevitably leads to the Joule heating issue. Magnon torques can potentially circumvent this issue, as it enables the transport of spin angular momentum in insulating magnetic materials. In this work, we fabricate a sandwich structure composed of Hf/antiferromagnetic Cr2O3/ferromagnet and demonstrate that the magnon torque is strongly dependent on the crystalline structure of Cr2O3. Magnon torques are stronger when the Neel vector of Cr2O3 aligns parallel to the spin polarization generated in Hf, while they are suppressed when the Neel vector is perpendicular to the spin polarization. The magnon torque efficiency is estimated to be -0.134 using in-plane second harmonic Hall measurements. Using magnon torques, we achieve perpendicular magnetization switching of CoFeB, with a critical switching current density of 4.09 x 10^7 A/cm^2. Furthermore, the spin angular momentum loss due to the insertion of Cr2O3 is found to be lower than that of polycrystalline NiO. Our work highlights the role of antiferromagnet crystalline structures in controlling magnon torques, broadening the potential applications of magnon torques.

Title: Transport characteristics in Hermitian and non-Hermitian Fibonacci rings: A comparative study
Authors: Souvik Roy, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: We present an extensive theoretical analysis of transport and circular currents and the associated induced magnetic fields in Fibonacci rings, explored in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian descriptions, with particular attention to configurations preserving or breaking PT symmetry. By engineering physically balanced gain and loss following a Fibonacci sequence, we realize two distinct geometrical configurations in which the ring either preserve or explicitly break PT symmetry, and further explore complementary realizations obtained by reversing the signs of the on site potentials. Using the non equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we analyze transmission properties and bond current densities to quantify both transport and circulating currents. A comparison with the Hermitian limit establishes a clear baseline, where the ring supports only weak responses upon introducing disorder. In sharp contrast, non-Hermiticity leads to a pronounced amplification of transport and circular currents, and hence of the induced magnetic field. We further demonstrate that non-Hermitian transport is highly sensitive to gain and loss sign reversal and, in the non-PT-symmetric case, exhibits an unconventional dependence on system size governed by the parity of the Fibonacci sequence and hopping correlations. Remarkably, the current does not decay monotonically with increasing system size, revealing a distinct scaling behavior absent in conventional Hermitian systems. Our results highlight non-Hermitian quasiperiodic rings as versatile platforms for engineering and amplifying current driven magnetic responses through symmetry, topology, and gain-loss design.

Title: Phonon-induced Markovian and non-Markovian effects on absorption spectra of moiré excitons in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers
Authors: Daniel Groll, Anton Plonka, Kevin Jürgens, Daniel Wigger, Tilmann Kuhn
Abstract: The properties of moiré excitons in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) vary significantly with the twist angle, ranging from quasi localized excitons with flat dispersions for small twist angles to delocalized excitons for larger ones. This twist angle dependence directly impacts the exciton-phonon coupling, which plays a significant role for the optical properties of these materials. In this work we theoretically investigate the twist angle dependent influence of phonons on absorption spectra of intralayer moiré excitons in a twisted TMDC hetero-bilayer. For the lowest-lying intralayer moiré exciton we find that the exciton-phonon coupling interpolates between two physically distinct regimes when tuning the twist angle. At small twist angles non-Markovian polarization dynamics and phonon sidebands dominate the properties of absorption spectra for localized excitons. For larger twist angles Markovian processes become more important leading to additional line broadening. Furthermore, the absorption spectra here show a characteristic asymmetric peak similar to monolayer TMDCs. When taking into account multiple bright moiré exciton bands we find that intraband scattering due to optical phonons has a significant impact on absorption spectra, effectively suppressing absorption peaks of higher lying bands when their bandwidth surpasses the optical phonon energy.

Title: Heterogeneous ice nucleation on model substrates
Authors: Miguel Camarillo, Javier Oller-Iscar, María M. Conde, Jorge Ramírez, Eduardo Sanz
Abstract: Ice nucleation is greatly important in areas as diverse as climate change, cryobiology, geology or food industry. Predicting the ability of a substrate to induce the nucleation of ice from supercooled water is a difficult problem. Here, we use molecular simulations to analyse how the ice nucleating ability is affected by the substrate lattice structure and orientation. We focus on different model lattices: simple cubic, body centred cubic and face centred cubic, and assess their ability to induce ice nucleation by calculating nucleation rates. Several orientations are studied for the case of the face centred cubic lattice. Curiously, a hexagonal symmetry does not guarantee a better ice nucleating ability. By comparing the body centred cubic and the cubic lattices we determined that there is a significant role of the underlying crystal plane(s) on ice nucleation. The structure of the liquid layer adjacent to the substrate reveals that more efficient nucleants induce a more structured liquid. The most efficient substrates present a strong sensitivity of their ice nucleating ability to the lattice parameters. Introducing a novel methodological approach, we use Classical Nucleation Theory to estimate the contact angle of the ice nucleus on the studied substrates from the calculated nucleation rates. The method also provides the nucleation free energy barrier height, the kinetic pre-factor and the critical cluster size. The latter is in agreement with the nucleus size obtained through a microscopic analysis of the nucleation trajectories, which supports the validity of Classical Nucleation Theory down to small critical clusters.

Title: Noncollinear spin structure in Dy-doped classical ferrimagnet

Abstract: Noncollinear spin structures have attracted tremendous attention because they offer a versatile platform for spin control and manipulation, essential in spintronics. Realizing noncollinearity in ferrimagnetic insulators is of particular interest as they can be potentially utilized in low-damping spintronics with tunable magnetic order. Within the spinel-ferrite family, Zn and Al-substituted nickel ferrite (NiZAF) has emerged as an excellent choice for low-damping spintronics. However, realizing noncollinearity in such systems remains challenging. Here, we present evidence of noncollinear spin structure in the NiZAF thin films induced by the rare earth Dy-doping, utilizing the soft x-ray spectroscopy methods such as magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray resonant magnetic reflectivity (XRMR). In particular, XRMR reveals a spiral-type spin structure, which is attributed to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, arising due to broken inversion symmetry by the Dy-induced local strain field as confirmed by our theoretical calculations. The realization of noncollinearity in the spinel-ferrite opens pathway to explore the possibility of chiral magnetic domains and topological spin textures exhibiting promise for oxide-based spintronics

Title: Pressure-driven Valence evolution Coupled Hardening-to-Softening transition in YbPd
Authors: B. Tegomo Chiogo, V. Balédent, J.-P. Rueff, Ethan Saïman, V. Poree, T. Schweitzer, D. Wong, C. Schulz, T. Mazet, A. Chainani, D. Malterre, K. Habicht
Abstract: We investigate the Yb valence instabilities in the strongly correlated YbPd compound using resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy under pressure across the charge-ordering (CO) transition. At a low temperature (T = 30 K) in the CO ordered phase, the Yb $4f$ valence remains nearly constant up to a pressure P$_K$ = 1.5 GPa, and then increases gradually at higher pressures. In contrast, at room temperature in the normal phase, an anomalous decrease of the Yb $4f$ valence is observed, without any accompanying structural phase transition. This behavior is corroborated by a systematic pressure dependent decrease of the unit-cell volume. Based on a Birch-Murnaghan analysis, the compressibility indicates hardening of the lattice with applied pressure up to a distinct kink seen at P$_K$ = 1.5 GPa. In contrast, for P $>$ P$_K$, the Yb $4f$ valency saturates and the compressibility reveals a counterintuitive pressure-induced softening. The results show a minimum in the compressibility of YbPd (with $f^{13}$-$f^{14}$ hole-type mixed-valence) and is reminiscent of the maximum in compressibility seen in the $\gamma$-$\alpha$ first-order isostructural phase transition in cerium (with $f^{0}$-$f^{1}$ electron-type mixed-valence).

Title: Reservoir computing from collective dynamics of active colloidal oscillators
Authors: Veit-Lorenz Heuthe, Lukas Seemann, Samuel Tovey, Clemens Bechinger
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing is a computational framework that offers an energy- and computation-efficient alternative to conventional training of neural networks. In reservoir computing, input signals are mapped into the high-dimensional dynamics of a nonlinear system, and only a simple readout layer is trained. In most physical implementations, the interactions that give rise to the dynamics cannot be tuned directly and high dimensionality is typically achieved through time-multiplexing, which can limit flexibility and efficiency. Here we introduce a reservoir composed of hundreds of hydrodynamically coupled active colloidal oscillators forming a fully parallel physical reservoir and whose coupling strength and fading-memory time can be tuned in situ. The collective dynamics of the active oscillators allow accurate predictions of chaotic time series from single reservoir readouts without time-multiplexing. We further demonstrate real-time detection of subtle hidden anomalies that preserve all instantaneous statistical properties of the signal yet disrupt its underlying temporal correlations. These results establish interacting active colloids as a reconfigurable platform for physical computation and edge-integrated intelligent sensing for model-free detection of irregularities in complex time signals.

Title: Nonlinear mode interactions under parametric excitation in a YIG microdisk

Abstract: A pair of quantized spin-wave modes is driven by two-tone parallel pumping in a YIG microdisk. The nonlinear dynamics is experimentally investigated by probing the resulting steady state, which is found to critically depend on the chosen pair of modes, the detuning between the pump frequencies and the modes parametric resonance, as well as the temporal sequence of the two rf tones. A general theory of parametric excitation in confined structures based on magnetization normal modes is developed and quantitatively accounts for the observed dependence and non-commutative behaviors, which emerge from the interplay between the self and mutual nonlinear frequency shifts of the spin-wave modes. Owing to its high degree of external controllability and scalability to larger sets of modes, this dynamical system provides a model platform for exploring nonlinear phenomena and a promising route toward rf driven state mapping relevant to neuromorphic and unconventional computing.

Title: Phase Frustration Induced Intrinsic Bose Glass in the Kitaev-Bose-Hubbard Model
Authors: Yi-fan Zhu, Shi-jie Yang
Abstract: We report an intrinsic "Bubble Phase" in the two-dimensional Kitaev-Bose-Hubbard model, driven purely by phase frustration between complex hopping and anisotropic pairing. By combining Inhomogeneous Gutzwiller Mean-Field Theory with a Bogoliubov-de Gennes stability analysis augmented by a novel Energy Penalty Method, we demonstrate that this phase spontaneously fragments into coherent islands, exhibiting the hallmark Bose glass signature of finite compressibility without global superfluidity. Notably, we propose a unified framework linking disorder-driven localization to deterministic phase frustration, identifying the Bubble Phase as a pristine, disorder-free archetype of the Bose glass. Our results provide a theoretical blueprint for realizing glassy dynamics in clean quantum simulators.

Title: Gate-tunable charge-spin interconversion in graphene/heavy-metal heterostructures
Authors: Zhendong Chi, Eoin Dolan, Haozhe Yang, Beatriz Martín-García, Marco Gobbi, Luis E. Hueso, Fèlix Casanova
Abstract: Spintronics has emerged as a promising field for next-generation devices, offering functionalities beyond complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS). A critical challenge in spintronics is to develop systems that can efficiently generate spin currents and enable their long-distance transport. Here, we demonstrate a graphene (Gr)/heavy metal (HM) heterostructure system that combines strong charge-spin interconversion efficiency, induced by the spin Hall effect, with a long spin diffusion length. By employing an industry-friendly magnetron sputtering technique, we deposit HM layers onto few-layer Gr while minimizing structural damage. The proximity effect from the HM enhances the spin Hall angle of Gr while limiting the reduction in its spin diffusion length. Additionally, the spin Hall angle can be tuned via an applied gate voltage, offering high controllability of the system. Importantly, these properties are observed across heterostructures composed of different HMs, indicating the generality of this approach. Our findings establish Gr/HM heterostructures as a scalable and versatile platform for spin current generation, paving the way for advanced spintronic devices with high efficiency, long spin propagation, and straightforward fabrication processes.

Title: Early bloodmaterial interfacial events and capillary transport on nanoparticle modified nanofibers
Authors: Romain Scarabelli, Mehdi Abbasi, Magali Gary-Bobo, Christophe Drouet, Marc Leonetti, Ahmed Al-Kattan
Abstract: Electrospun poly(\epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL)nanofibrous mats are widely considered for blood-contacting wound dressings and small-diameter vascular applications; however, their intrinsic hydrophobicity limits rapid wetting and controlled interaction with blood. In this work, we modulate the interfacial response of PCL nanofibers by incorporating oxide-shelled silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in liquid, a ligand-free approach that avoids organic stabilizers and preserves surface reactivity. Two composite architectures were designed: SiNPs embedded within the fiber bulk (PAC1,4,16) and SiNPs preferentially exposed at the fiber surface (SPAC1,4,16), with systematically increasing nanoparticle loadings. Structural characterization confirmed the retention of a homogeneous fibrous morphology and the targeted nanoparticle distribution. The dynamic interaction with whole blood was quantified using time-resolved contact-angle measurements, complemented by top-view optical microscopy and three-dimensional profilometry of dried droplets. Pristine PCL remained strongly hydrophobic whereas a hydrophilic PCL functionalized with APTES showed rapid spreading. Incorporation of SiNPs within the fiber volume led to only a moderate enhancement of wettability, and dried droplets retained compact morphologies with limited spreading. In contrast, surface-decorated mats displayed a sharp, concentration-dependent transition toward highly wettable behavior: for SPAC16, the contact angle fell below 20, droplet profiles became markedly flattened, and microscopy revealed extended plasma-rich regions surrounding a red-cell-rich core, indicative of pronounced phase separation within the nanofibrous network.

Title: Angular-Dependent Thermal Hall Effect in a Honeycomb Magnet: Disentangling Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interactions
Authors: Shuvankar Gupta, Olajumoke Oluwatobiloba Emmanuel, Pengpeng Zhang, Xianglin Ke
Abstract: Layered honeycomb magnets have garnered significant attention recently for their exotic quantum phenomena due to the potential anisotropic, bond-dependent Kitaev interactions. However, distinguishing the roles of Kitaev interactions and the symmetry-allowed Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) remains challenging, since both mechanisms may lead to similar magnetic excitations and thermal transport properties. To tackle this challenge, using a ferromagnetic honeycomb insulator VI3 as a model system, we systematically study the angular-dependent thermal Hall conductivity Kxy({\theta}, {\Phi}) with both out-of-plane ({\theta}) and in-plane ({\Phi}) magnetic field rotations. Our results reveal a persistent thermal Hall response for both out-of-plane and in-plane rotating magnetic fields, devoid of the sign-reversal patterns characteristic of Kitaev physics. Instead, quantitative analysis shows that the angular dependent Kxy({\theta}, {\Phi}) is governed by the projection between the magnetic moment and a tilted DM vector containing both out-of-plane and in-plane components. These results not only establish the DMI-driven topological magnetic excitations as the origin of the thermal Hall response in VI3 but also highlight the angular-dependent thermal Hall effect measurements as an effective approach for distinguishing competing interactions in quantum magnets.

Title: Cooperative concurrence of 4f and 3d flat bands in kagome heavy-fermion metal YbCr6Ge6
Authors: Wenxin Lv, Pengcheng Ma, Tianqi Wang, Shangjie Tian, Ying Ma, Shouguo Wang, Xiao Zhang, Zhonghao Liu, Hechang Lei
Abstract: Flat-band (FB) systems originating from special lattice geometry like in kagome metals as well as localized orbitals in the materials such as heavy-fermion (HF) compounds have induced intensive interest due to their band topology and strong electron correlation effects, leading to emergent quantum states of matter. However, the question of how these two distinct FBs coexist and interact remains unsettled. Here, we report that YbCr6Ge6 hosting both Cr-kagome lattice and Yb-4f electrons exhibits HF behaviors and a robust antiferromagnetic ground state with transition temperature TN = 3 K, significantly higher than other similar kagome metals with Yb ions. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal the coexistence of FBs originating from both Cr-kagome lattice and localized Yb-4f electrons near Fermi energy level EF. More importantly, the clear spectroscopic signatures of a hybridization of Yb-4f FB with kagome-lattice-derived conduction bands and the high density of states of Cr-kagome FB near EF provide the underlying microscopic mechanisms of HF behaviors and enhanced antiferromagnetism in YbCr6Ge6. Our findings demonstrate that the novel kagome HF metals can not only host the cooperative coexistence of two different types of FBs, but also provide a paradigm material platform to explore the exotic correlated topological quantum phenomena.

Title: On the Feasibility of Extreme Heating Rates in SEM using MEMS Heater Platforms
Authors: C. Koenig, P. Mayr, J.R. Jinschek, A. Bastos Fanta
Abstract: Understanding microstructural evolution under extreme thermal conditions is essential for advancing metal additive manufacturing (AM). This work demonstrates the feasibility of employing micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) heating platforms for in-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization of bulk-like samples during rapid thermal cycling. Using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), we tracked the ferrite-to-austenite phase transformation in a pure iron specimen and confirmed that the sample surface temperature closely follows the MEMS temperature setpoint within device accuracy. Under vacuum conditions, stable heating and cooling rates of up to 1000 C/s were achieved with minimal power input and without compromising EBSD pattern quality. These findings establish MEMS-based heating as a robust approach for in-situ microstructural characterization of AM-relevant thermal processes in the SEM, enabling quantitative studies of thermally activated phenomena such as diffusion, phase transformations, and microstructural evolution under far-from-equilibrium conditions.

Title: Vorticity-Crystalline Order Coupling in Supersolids: Excitations and Re-entrant Phases
Authors: Malte Schubert, Koushik Mukherjee, Philipp Stürmer, Stephanie Reimann
Abstract: Rotation is a natural tool in ultracold gases to break time-reversal symmetry, yet its impact on the collective excitations of supersolids remains largely unexplored. We show theoretically that tuning the rotation frequency, (rather than the interparticle interactions), can trigger the superfluid-to-supersolid transition in Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs). Computing excitation spectra in the presence of vortices and persistent currents, we uncover a vortex-driven de-softening mechanism whereby quantized vorticity elevates the gapless Goldstone mode to a finite-energy roton, restoring superfluidity. This effect results in re-entrant supersolid phases as a function of rotation frequency, revealing a fundamental coupling between topological defects and crystalline order.

Title: Topological origin of peak splitting in the structure factor of liquid water
Authors: Zoé Faure Beaulieu, Volker L. Deringer, Fausto Martelli
Abstract: The splitting of the principal peak in the structure factor of liquid water is commonly interpreted as evidence of a competition between two distinct local environments. Here, we show that this peak splitting arises from medium-range topological features of the hydrogen-bond network. Using atomistic simulations, we systematically decompose the structure factor into contributions from hydrogen-bonded rings of different sizes. We find that 5-8-membered rings, which dominate the network topology of liquid water at low temperatures, can directly explain the experimentally observed bimodal scattering signal. Among these, 5-membered rings are particularly persistent, maintaining distinct structural signatures even above room temperature. Our findings establish a direct link between the network topology of liquid water and experimentally accessible diffraction features, clarifying the microscopic basis of water's behaviour and suggesting a broader conceptual framework for interpreting the anomalies in tetrahedral network liquids and glasses.

Title: Learning microstructure in active matter
Authors: Writu Dasgupta, Suvendu Mandal, Aritra K. Mukhopadhyay, Benno Liebchen
Abstract: Understanding microstructure in terms of closed-form expressions is an open challenge in nonequilibrium statistical physics. We propose a simple and generic method that combines particle-resolved simulations, deep neural networks and symbolic regression to predict the pair-correlation function of passive and active particles. Our analytical closed-form results closely agree with Brownian dynamics simulations, even at relatively large packing fractions and for strong activity. The proposed method is broadly applicable, computationally efficient, and can be used to enhance the predictive power of nonequilibrium continuum theories and for designing pattern formation.

Title: High-Energy Interlayer Exciton Ensembles in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ Heterostructures by Laguerre-Gaussian Excitation
Authors: Mirco Troue, Johannes Figueiredo, Gabriel Mittermair, Jonas Kiemle, Sebastian Loy, Hendrik Lambers, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Ursula Wurstbauer, Alexander W. Holleitner
Abstract: We reveal the higher energetic luminescence part of interlayer exciton ensembles in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures upon excitation by an optical Laguerre-Gaussian mode. The excitation is achieved with the help of a spatial light modulator giving rise to a ring-shaped distribution of interlayer excitons. A hyperspectral analysis of the exciton photoluminescence suggests that the excitation scheme allows the accumulation of high-energetic excitons in the rings' center. We discuss the mechanisms leading to such a distribution, including exciton-exciton interaction, phase-space filling, and an incomplete thermalization.

Title: First-principles study of hydrogen diffusion in polycrystalline Nickel
Authors: Bhanuj Jain, Alaa Olleak, Junyan He, Adarsh Chaurasia, Davide Di Stefano
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement in metals is strongly governed by hydrogen diffusion and trapping, yet predicting these effects in polycrystalline systems remains challenging. This work introduces a multiscale modeling framework that links atomistic energetics to continuum-scale transport. Migration barriers for bulk and grain-boundary environments, obtained from first-principles calculations, are used in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to compute anisotropic effective diffusivities. These diffusivities are then incorporated into finite element models of polycrystalline microstructures, explicitly accounting for grain-boundary character and connectivity. The approach captures both fast-path and trapping effects without relying on empirical parameters and reproduces experimental trends for nickel, including the dependence of effective diffusivity on grain size and boundary type. This methodology provides a physically grounded route for predicting hydrogen transport in engineering alloys and can be extended to other materials and defect types.

Title: Phase-space networks and connectivity of the kagome antiferromagnet
Authors: Brandon B. Le, Seung-Hun Lee, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: We study the coplanar ground-state manifold of the kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet using a phase-space network representation, in which nodes correspond to coplanar ground states and edges represent transitions generated by weathervane loop rotations. In the coplanar manifold, each configuration can be mapped to a three-coloring problem on the dual honeycomb lattice, where a weathervane mode corresponds to a closed loop of two alternating colors. By comparing networks that include all weathervane loops with networks restricted to elementary six-spin loops, we examine how energetic constraints shape phase-space structure. We find that connectivity distributions are sharply peaked in large systems, while restrictions to short loops reduce typical connectivity. Spectral properties further distinguish the two cases, with short-loop networks exhibiting Gaussian spectra and full networks displaying non-Gaussian features associated with correlated loop updates. Finally, a box-counting analysis reveals distinct fractal properties of the two networks, demonstrating how energetic constraints control the global geometry of configuration space. These results show that the hierarchy of weathervane loop rotations provides a direct link between microscopic constraints and emergent phase-space geometry in a frustrated magnet.

Title: Reverse segregation and self-organization in inclined chute flows of bidisperse granular mixtures
Authors: Joseph M. Monti, Joel T. Clemmer, Ishan Srivastava, Leonardo E. Silbert, Gary S. Grest, Jeremy B. Lechman
Abstract: In the usual segregation scenario for stable inclined chute flows of bidisperse mixtures of fine and coarse spherical particles, coarse particles rise toward the free surface, forming a coarse-rich region atop the flowing pile. Beyond a threshold coarse-to-fine diameter ratio of approximately 4, conversely, the weight of the coarse particles exceeds the segregation driving forces, causing individual coarse particles to sink within the pile and producing a reversed segregation state. However, an understanding of the collective evolution of the pile structure is still lacking when the particle diameter ratio exceeds 4 {\textit{and}} the coarse particle mass fraction is appreciable. To explore this broadly bidisperse limit, we perform discrete element method simulations considering mean particle diameter ratios of up to 8 and coarse particle mass fractions spanning 0.1 to 0.9. The steady-state flow profiles reveal several intriguing behaviors that depend on the diameter ratio and mass fraction. These include a previously identified transition from usual to reverse segregation and a newfound tendency to self-organize into alternating coarse- and fine-rich particle layers stacked along the shear gradient direction, with layer thickness dictated by the coarse particle diameter. A fuller understanding of segregation at this scale could pave the way for enhanced mixing or demixing techniques at the commercial scale.

Title: A Critical Examination of Active Learning Workflows in Materials Science
Authors: Akhil S. Nair, Lucas Foppa
Abstract: Active learning (AL) plays a critical role in materials science, enabling applications such as the construction of machine-learning interatomic potentials for atomistic simulations and the operation of self-driving laboratories. Despite its widespread use, the reliability and effectiveness of AL workflows depend on implicit design assumptions that are rarely examined systematically. Here, we critically assess AL workflows deployed in materials science and investigate how key design choices, such as surrogate models, sampling strategies, uncertainty quantification and evaluation metrics, relate to their performance. By identifying common pitfalls and discussing practical mitigation strategies, we provide guidance to practitioners for the efficient design, assessment, and interpretation of AL workflows in materials science.

Title: Thermally Configurable Multi-Order Polar Skyrmions in Multiferroic Oxide Superlattices
Authors: Kefan Liu, Yuhui Huang, Xiangwei Guo, Yongjun Wu, Juan Li, Zijian Hong
Abstract: Polar topological textures in low-dimensional ferroelectrics have emerged as a versatile platform for high-density information storage and neuromorphic computing. While low-order topological states, such as vortices and skyrmions, have been extensively studied, high-order polar topological families remain largely unexplored due to their higher energy requirements and limited stabilization methods. Here, using a BiFeO3 (BFO)-based multiferroic superlattice as a model system, we demonstrate a thermal-modulation strategy that stabilizes multi-order polar skyrmions and enables reversible tuning of their topological order through phase-field simulations. It was found that temperature modulation drives the system from polar solitons through 1{\pi}-, 2{\pi}-, 3{\pi}-, and 4{\pi}-skyrmion states, with closed heating-cooling path analyses revealing the widest thermal stability window for 2{\pi}-skyrmions (up to 600 K). Leveraging this robustness, 2% Sm doping in BFO lowers the transition temperatures, enabling room-temperature stabilization of 2{\pi}-skyrmions. These findings enrich the fundamental understanding of multi-order polar topologies and establish a tunable strategy for realizing variable-order topological configurations in practical memory devices.

Title: Evolution of the Berry curvature dipole in uniaxially strained bilayer graphene
Authors: Karel Cuypers, Robin Smeyers, Bert Jorissen, Lucian Covaci
Abstract: While in pristine bilayer graphene the Berry curvature dipole (BCD), a necessary ingredient for the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect, is zero, uniaxial strain can give rise to finite BCD. We investigate this by using a tight-binding (TB) approach build on the Slater-Koster parameterization to capture lattice deformation effects often missed by continuum models. We demonstrate that the BCD's evolution with strain and doping is highly sensitive to the choice in parameterization, particularly when including the longer range interlayer skew hoppings. Additionally, out-of-plane compression enhances the response by broadening the Dirac cones. These findings benchmark low-energy continuum models and highlight the necessity of realistic tight-binding models for accurately predicting strain-engineered Hall effects in bilayer graphene.

Title: Mode-Selective Cloaking and Ghost Quantum Wells in Bilayer Graphene Transport
Authors: Dan-Na Liu, Jun Zheng, Pierre A. Pantaleon
Abstract: We study ballistic electron transport through electrostatic barriers in AB-stacked bilayer graphene within a full four-band framework. A mode-resolved analysis reveals how propagating and evanescent channels couple across electrostatic interfaces and how channel selectivity governs transport at normal incidence. We show that, even when decoupled channels remain inactive, perfect transmission can occur at discrete energies due to phase matching of a single internal mode within an individual barrier. This effect is interpreted as a ghost quantum well, namely an effective cavity formed by internal phase coherence inside the barrier, without true bound states and without restoring coupling to decoupled channels. For single- and double-barrier geometries, we derive compact analytical expressions for the transmission and identify the corresponding resonance conditions. Extending the analysis to multibarrier structures using a transfer-matrix approach, we demonstrate how perfect resonances driven by internal phase matching coexist with Fabry-Perot-like resonances arising from inter-barrier interference. Our results provide a unified, channel-resolved description of tunnelling suppression and resonance-assisted transport in bilayer graphene barrier systems.

Title: Exact Volterra series for mean field dynamics
Authors: Ion Santra, Matthias Krüger
Abstract: We derive an exact Volterra series expansion for a mean field of an interacting particle system subject to a potential perturbation, expressing the Volterra expansion kernels in terms of the field's response functions, to any order. Applying this formalism to the mean particle density of a simple fluid, we identify a form reminiscent of dynamical density functional theory, with, however, fundamental differences: A nonlocal mobility kernel appears, and forces derive from a functional of the {\it history} of mean density. The equilibrium density functional is shown to be recovered in the limit of slowly varying perturbation. We identify a freedom in deriving this expansion, which allows different forms of mobility kernels. These developments allow for a systematic improvement of established mean field formalisms.

Title: Slow mixing and emergent one-form symmetries in three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory
Authors: Charles Stahl, Benedikt Placke, Vedika Khemani, Yaodong Li
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking order at low temperatures is often accompanied by slow relaxation dynamics, due to diverging free-energy barriers arising from interfaces between different ordered states. Here, we extend this correspondence to classical topological order, where the ordered states are locally indistinguishable, so there is no notion of interfaces between them. We study the relaxation dynamics of the three-dimensional (3D) classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) as a canonical example. We prove a lower bound on the mixing time in the deconfined phase, $t_{\text{mix}} = \exp [\Omega(L)]$, where L is the linear system size. This bound applies even in the presence of perturbations that explicitly break the one-form symmetry between different long-lived states. This perturbation destroys the energy barriers between ordered states, but we show that entropic effects nevertheless lead to diverging free-energy barriers at nonzero temperature. Our proof establishes the LGT as a robust finite-temperature classical memory. We further prove that entropic effects lead to an emergent one-form symmetry, via a notion that we make precise. We argue that the exponential mixing time follows from universal properties of the deconfined phase, and numerically corroborate this expectation by exploring mixing time scales at the Higgs and confinement transitions out of the deconfined phase. These transitions are found to exhibit markedly different dynamic scaling, even though both have the static critical exponents of the 3D Ising model. We expect this novel entropic mechanism for memory and emergent symmetry to also bring insight into self-correcting quantum memories.

Title: Symmetry-controlled thermal activation in pyramidal Coulomb clusters: Testing Kramers-Langer theory
Authors: Akhil Ayyadevara, Anand Prakash, Shovan Dutta, Arun Paramekanti, S. A. Rangwala
Abstract: Laser-cooled ions confined in electromagnetic traps provide a unique, tunable mesoscopic system where the interplay of the trapping potential, nonlinear Coulomb interactions, and laser-ion scattering generates rich, collective dynamics. In this work, we engineer thermally activated switching between two oppositely oriented, square-pyramidal configurations of five laser-cooled ions in a Paul trap. For identical ions ($^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$), the inversions proceed via a \textit{Berry pseudo-rotation} mechanism with a low activation barrier, enabled by the permutation symmetry, in contrast to the \textit{umbrella inversion} observed in ammonia. The experimentally measured inversion rates, spanning two orders of magnitude, are accurately captured by the multidimensional Kramers-Langer theory, enabling thermometry of the Doppler-cooled ion cluster at $1.8 \pm 0.1$ mK. By substituting the apex ion with a heavier isotope ($^{44}\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$), we break the permutation symmetry and observe a suppression of thermally activated inversions. Numerical analysis reveals that this symmetry breaking closes the low-barrier channel, forcing the system to invert through a high-barrier \textit{turnstile rotation}. Thus, we demonstrate a structural analogue of molecular kinetic isotope effects, establishing trapped ions as a versatile platform to explore symmetry-controlled collective dynamics.

Title: Autonomous Sampling and SHAP Interpretation of Deposition-Rates in Bipolar HiPIMS
Authors: Alexander Wieczorek, Nathan Rodkey, Jan Sommerhäuser, Jason Hattrick-Simpers, Sebastian Siol
Abstract: High-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) offers considerable control over ion energy and flux, making it invaluable for tailoring the microstructure and properties of advanced functional coatings. However, compared to conventional sputtering techniques, HiPIMS suffers from reduced deposition rates. Many groups have begun to evaluate complex pulsing schemes to improve upon this, leveraging multi-pulse schemes (e.g. pre-ionization or bipolar pulses). Unfortunately, the increased complexity of these pulsing schemes has led to high-dimensionality parameter spaces that are prohibitive to classic design of experi-ments. In this work we evaluate bipolar HiPIMS pulses for improving deposition rates of Al and Ti sputter tar-gets. Over 3000 process conditions were collected via autonomous Bayesian sampling over a 6-dimensional parameter space. These process conditions were then interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to deconvolute complex process influences on deposition rates. This allows us to link observed var-iations in deposition rate to physical mechanisms such as back-attraction and plasma ignition. Insights gained from this approach were then used to target specific processes where the positive pulse components were expected to have the highest impact on deposition rates. However, in practice, only minimal improve-ments in deposition rate were achieved. In most cases, the positive pulse appears to be detrimental when placed immediately after the neg. pulse which we hypothesize relates to quenching of the afterglow plasma. The proposed workflow combining autonomous experimentation and interpretable machine learning is broad-ly applicable to the discovery and optimization of complex plasma processes, paving the way for physics-informed, data-driven advancements in coating technologies.

Title: Modeling phononic band gap in microstructured solids using the Riemann-Cartan geometric framework
Authors: Ilya Peshkov, Loïc Le Marrec
Abstract: Modeling acoustic wave fields in microstructured elastic solids is discussed in the context of the Riemann-Cartan geometry. We consider a scenario where microstructural deformations occur much faster than those of the bulk material. This time-scale separation creates apparent geometric incompatibilities at the macroscopic level, even without any permanent inelastic deformation (at micro or macro-scale) or damage. We formalize this phenomenon using the concept of a non-holonomic tetrads to represent the macroscopic elastic deformations and the associated torsion field to characterize the resulting geometric incompatibilities. The spatial components of the torsion tensor quantify the instantaneous geometric incompatibility of the macroscopic elastic deformations, while its time components capture the inertial effects arising from the reversible energy exchange between the micro and macro scales. A key finding is that the model's dispersion relation predicts the existence of a complete frequency band gap. Furthermore, the governing equations exhibit a notable mathematical analogy to Maxwell's equations which can link the modeling of phononic and photonic metamaterials.

Title: Emergence of the 2nd Law in an Exactly Solvable Model of a Quantum Wire
Authors: Marco A. Jimenez-Valencia, Charles A. Stafford
Abstract: As remarked by Boltzmann, the Second Law of Thermodynamics is notable for the fact that it is readily proved using elementary statistical arguments, but becomes harder and harder to verify the more precise the microscopic description of a system. In this article, we investigate one particular realization of the 2nd Law, namely Joule heating in a wire under electrical bias. We analyze the production of entropy in an exactly solvable model of a quantum wire wherein the conserved flow of entropy under unitary quantum evolution is taken into account using an exact formula for the entropy current of a system of independent quantum particles. In this exact microscopic description of the quantum dynamics, the entropy production due to Joule heating does not arise automatically. Instead, we show that the expected entropy production is realized in the limit of a large number of local measurements by a series of floating thermoelectric probes along the length of the wire, which inject entropy into the system as a result of the information obtained via their continuous measurements of the system. The decoherence resulting from inelastic processes introduced by the local measurements is essential to the phenomenon of entropy production due to Joule heating, and would be expected to arise due to inelastic scattering in real systems of interacting particles.

Title: An Operator-Algebraic Framework for Anyons and Defects in Quantum Spin Systems
Authors: Siddharth Vadnerkar
Abstract: In this dissertation, we detail an operator algebraic approach to studying topological order in the infinite volume setting. We give a thorough and self-contained review of the DHR-style approach on quantum spin systems, which builds a category $\mathrm{\textbf{DHR}}$ of anyon sectors starting from microscopic lattice spin systems. In general, this category has the structure of a braided $\mathrm{C}^*$-tensor category. We will verify in full detail that $\mathrm{\textbf{DHR}}$ is the expected category in Kitaev's Quantum Double model, a paradigmatic model for studying topological order on the lattice. We will then extend the DHR-style analysis to systems in the presence of a global on-site symmetry, and introduce a category of symmetry defects, $G\mathsf{Sec}$, and show that it has the structure of a $G$-crossed braided $\mathrm{C}^*$-tensor category.

Title: Chaos, thermalization and breakdown of quantum-classical correspondence in a collective many-body system
Authors: Ángel L. Corps, Sebastián Gómez, Pavel Stránský, Armando Relaño, Pavel Cejnar
Abstract: We investigate thermalization and the quantum-classical correspondence in the fully-connected Bose-Hubbard model, focusing on the four-site case. Our analysis of the classical phase-space structure and its excited-state quantum phase transitions leads us to three dynamical regimes: symmetry-breaking low-energy states, an intermediate region where quantum and classical equilibrium states markedly disagree, and a high-energy regime with restored correspondence. The observed classical intermittency above the first excited-state quantum phase transition contrasts with quantum dynamics, which remains trapped in symmetry-breaking sectors despite the existence of a classically connected phase space. This mismatch originates from the population of imbalance-carrying eigenstates and persists even for relatively large number of particles. Our results reveal unexpectedly slow convergence to the classical limit, signaling robust finite-size effects in collective many-body dynamics.

Title: Hidden time-nonlocal Floquet symmetries
Authors: Sigmund Kohler, Jesús Casado-Pascual
Abstract: We investigate the Floquet spectrum of a detuned, driven two-level system and show that it exhibits exact quasienergy crossings when the detuning is an integer multiple of the energy quantum of the driving field. This behavior can be explained by a hidden time-nonlocal parity, which allows the Floquet modes to be classified as even or odd. Then a generic feature is the emergence of exact crossings between quasienergies of different parity. A constructive proof of the existence of the symmetry is based on a scalar recurrence relation. Moreover, we present a general scheme for its numerical computation, which can be applied to models beyond the two-level system. Analytical results are illustrated with numerical data.

Title: Flow-wave coupling synchronizes oscillations in growing active matter
Authors: Lara Koehler, Elissavet Sandaltzopoulou, Frank Jülicher, Jan Brugués
Abstract: Oscillatory biochemical signals and mechanical forces must coordinate robustly during development, yet the principles governing their mutual coupling remain poorly understood. In syncytial embryos and cell-free extracts, mitotic waves propagate across millimeter scales while simultaneously generating cytoplasmic flows, suggesting a two-way interaction between chemical oscillators and mechanics. Here, we combine experiments in Xenopus Laevis cytoplasmic extracts with a minimal particle-based model to reveal a mechanochemical feedback that stabilizes phase wave propagation. In contrast to previous models of oscillatory active matter, an asymmetric size cycle, slow growth and rapid shrinkage, combined with size-dependent mechanical interactions generates a net particle displacement and flows aligned with the wave direction, which in turn drive a synchronization transition. Our results show that mechanical forces actively maintain the coherence of biochemical waves, providing a general mechanism for long-range order in oscillating active matter.

Title: Generation of squeezed optical states via stored classical pulses in a Bose gas
Authors: Sevilay Sevinçli, Dennis Rätzel, Markus Krutzik, Mehmet Özgür Oktel, Mustafa Gündoğan
Abstract: We propose and analyze a scheme to generate squeezed light by storing a classical probe pulse in a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) and exploiting the nonlinear evolution caused by atom--atom collisions during the storage time. A $\Lambda$-type optical memory interface maps a chosen temporal probe mode onto a single phase-matched collective spin wave; for a coherent input this prepares a tunable coherent spin state of a two-component BEC, with its initial spin orientation set by the stored mean excitation number and the phase relation between the probe and control fields. Collisional interactions during storage then implement one-axis-twisting dynamics and generate spin squeezing in the atomic ensemble. We account for realistic loss and finite memory and retrieval efficiencies, and model readout as a single-mode beam-splitter mapping that transfers the atomic quadrature squeezing onto a propagating optical mode. We identify optimal storage times and predict that, under realistic conditions, several dB of squeezing can be transferred to the retrieved light.

Title: Dynamical entanglement percolation with spatially correlated disorder
Authors: Lorenzo Cirigliano, Valentina Brosco, Claudio Castellano, Simone Felicetti, Laura Pilozzi, Bernard van Heck
Abstract: The distribution of entanglement between the nodes of a quantum network plays a fundamental role in quantum information applications. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of a network of qubits where each edge corresponds to an independent two-qubit interaction. By applying tools from percolation theory, we study how entanglement dynamically spreads across the network. We show that the interplay between unitary evolution and spatially correlated disorder leads to a non-standard percolation phenomenology, significantly richer than uniform bond percolation and featuring hysteresis. A two-colour correlated bond percolation model, whose phase diagram is determined via numerical simulations and a mean-field theory, fully elucidates the physics behind this phenomenon.

Title: Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy of oriented targets and magnetic transitions
Authors: Ioannis Iatrakis, Valerii Brudanin
Abstract: Electron beam energies in Transmission Electron Microscopes (TEMs) reach the relativistic realm constituting Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) the appropriate framework for the study of electron matter interaction in TEMs. We focus on the inelastic scattering of relativistic electrons from a generic oriented target. The inelastic differential cross section factorizes to the fast electron part which is calculated analytically, and the dynamic form factor of the target, which encodes the response of the medium to the interaction with the beam. The properties of the dynamic form factor of oriented targets are analyzed. We then derive the scattering cross section of electrons by magnetic targets where spin-flip transitions are induced. We comment on the kinematic regimes where the coefficient of the transverse magnetic interaction is amplified compared to the coulomb matrix element.

Title: Klein tunneling in deformed honeycomb-dice lattice: from massless to massive particles
Authors: L. Mandhour, F. Bouhadida
Abstract: We show that under compressive uniaxial deformation of the three-band $\alpha-T_3$ lattice, the Dirac cones move toward each other, merge, and a gap opens, while the flat band remains unchanged. Consequently, the low-energy spectrum transitions from linear to quadratic dispersion, indicating the shift from massless to massive Dirac particles. Here, we theoretically investigate the tunneling properties of particles through a sharp $np$ junction in a deformed $\alpha-T_3$ lattice, focusing on the case where the particle energy is half the junction height. We show that this transition from massless to massive particles leads to a change from omnidirectional total transmission, known as super-Klein tunneling, to omnidirectional total reflection, referred to as anti-super-Klein tunneling, in the case of the dice lattice ($\alpha=1$). For all values of $\alpha$, this transition manifests as a change from conventional Klein tunneling to anti-Klein tunneling.

Title: Itinerant magnetism in the triangular lattice Hubbard model at half-doping: Application to twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Yuchi He, Roman Rausch, Matthias Peschke, Christoph Karrasch, Philippe Corboz, Nick Bultinck, S.A. Parameswaran
Abstract: We use unrestricted Hartree-Fock, density matrix renormalization group, and variational projected entangled pair state calculations to investigate the ground state phase diagram of the triangular lattice Hubbard model at "half doping" relative to single occupancy, i.e. at a filling of $(1\pm \frac{1}{2})$ electrons per site. The electron-doped case has a nested Fermi surface in the non-interacting limit, and hence a weak-coupling instability towards density-wave orders whose wavevectors are determined by Fermi surface nesting conditions. We find that at moderate to strong interaction strengths other spatially-modulated orders arise, with wavevectors distinct from the nesting vectors. In particular, we identify a series closely-competing itinerant long-wavelength magnetically ordered states, yielding to uniform ferromagnetic order at the largest interaction strengths. For half-hole doping and a similar range of interaction strengths, our data indicate that magnetic orders are most likely absent.

Title: Characterizing the Many Body Localization Crossover as a Metal-Insulator Transition: Localization length from Polarization and Quantum Metric
Authors: W. N. Faugno, Tomoki Ozawa
Abstract: Many body localization (MBL) represents a unique physical phenomenon, providing a testing ground for exploring thermalization, or more precisely its failure. Here we characterize the MBL regime geometrically by the many-body quantum metric (MBQM), defined in the parameter space of twist boundary, and the localization parameter as defined in the modern theory of polarization and insulators. First, we demonstrate that the quantum metric can be used to characterize disordered insulating states by applying this theoretical framework to excited states of the 1D Anderson insulator. There we observe that the MBQM and localization parameter are related in finite realizations despite the states being gapless in the thermodynamic limit. Then, we consider a disordered 1D Bose-Hubbard model and find that we can characterize the ergodic-MBL crossover by comparing the MBQM and localization parameter. We find that we can extract a natural localization length in the MBL regime that characterizes the real space spread of the wave function and can be measured by extracting the quantum metric. Our analysis provides complementary insight into the MBL regime focusing on its insulating properties and providing a localization length whose definition is consistent across a range of insulating phases.

Title: Magnetodynamics of short nanoparticle chains
Authors: Thinh Q. Bui, Samuel D. Oberdick, Frank M. Abel, Michael J. Donahue, Klaus N. Quelhas, Cindi L. Dennis, Thomas Cleveland, Yanxin Liu, Solomon I. Woods
Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the understanding and application of nanoparticle assemblies driven by external fields. Although these systems can exhibit marked transitions in behavior compared to non-interacting counterparts, it has often proven challenging to connect their dynamics with underlying physical mechanisms or even to verifiably establish their structure under realistic experimental conditions. We have studied colloidal iron oxide nanoparticles that assemble into ordered, few-particle linear chains under the influence of oscillating and pulsed magnetic fields. In this work, our goal has been to answer the following question: by what physical mechanisms does the magnetic switching of a linear chain evolve from the switching of its constituent particles? Cryo-TEM has been used to flash freeze and image the structures formed by oscillatory drive fields, and magnetic relaxometry has been used to extract the multiple time constants associated with magnetic switching of the short chains. Armed with the physical structure from microscopy and the field-dependent switching times from magnetic measurements, we have conducted extensive micromagnetic simulations, revealing probable physical mechanisms for each time constant regime spanning ~1 microsecond to 1 s in time. These types of magnetic nanomaterials have great potential for biomedical technologies, particularly magnetic particle imaging and hyperthermia, and rigorous elucidation of their physics will hasten their optimization.

Title: Scattering Theory of Chiral Edge Modes in Topological Magnon Insulators
Authors: Stefan Birnkammer, Michael Knap, Johannes Knolle, Alexander Mook, Alvise Bastianello
Abstract: Topological magnon insulators exhibit robust edge modes with chiral properties similar to quantum Hall edge states. However, due to their strong localization at the edges, interactions between these chiral edge magnons can be significant, as we show in a model of coupled magnon-conserving spin chains in an electric field gradient. The chiral edge modes remain edge-localized and do not scatter into the bulk, and we characterize their scattering phase: for strongly-localized edge modes we observe significant deviation from the bare scattering phase. This renormalization of edge scattering can be attributed to bound bulk modes resonating with the chiral edge magnons, in the spirit of Feshbach resonances in atomic physics. We argue that the scattering dynamics can be probed experimentally with a real-time measurement protocol using inelastic scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Our results show that interaction among magnons can be encoded in an effective edge model of reduced dimensionality, where the interactions with the bulk renormalize the effective couplings. Our work introduces a systematic way to determine the many-body effective theory for edge states in topological magnon insulators.

Title: The single edge notch fracture test for viscoelastic elastomers
Authors: Farhad Kamarei, Fabio Sozio, Oscar Lopez-Pamies
Abstract: Making use of the Griffith criticality condition recently introduced by Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies (Extreme Mechanics Letters 58: 101944, 2023), this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the single edge notch fracture test for viscoelastic elastomers. The results -- comprised of a combination of a parametric study and direct comparisons with experiments -- reveal how the non-Gaussian elasticity, the nonlinear viscosity, and the intrinsic fracture energy of elastomers interact and govern when fracture nucleates from the pre-existing crack in these tests. The results also serve to quantify the limitations of existing analyses, wherein viscous effects and the actual geometries of the pre-existing cracks and the specimens are neglected.

Title: Topological Signatures of the Optical Bound on Maximal Berry Curvature: Application to Two-Dimensional Time-Reversal Symmetric Insulators
Authors: Pok Man Chiu
Abstract: Unlike broken time-reversal symmetric (TRS) systems with a defined Chern number, directly measuring the bulk $Z_{2}$ invariant and Berry curvature (if nonzero) in topological insulators and their higher-order topological families remains an unsolved problem. Here, based on the refined trace-determinant inequality (TDI) involving the trace and determinant of the quantum metric and maximal Berry curvature (MBC), we establish an optical bound on the MBC for two-dimensional TRS insulators. By utilizing experimental data on the optical conductivity within a certain energy range, the topological signatures can be identified through the frequency integration of the optical bound. This is supported by the momentum integration of the refined TDI and its $f$-sum rule and topological extension, which provide a topological lower bound. Meanwhile, the decay of optical weight in the topologically trivial region can be controlled by the optical gap and the inverse mass tensor. We illustrate our approach using three representative topological models: the Kane-Mele model, mirror-protected insulator, and quadrupole insulator. Remarkably, we find that the quantized quantum volume (QV) in the mirror-protected insulator results from the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Since QV has a topological lower bound, this suggests that double QV can be interpreted as an upper bound on the number of boundary states. Our findings offer a method for extracting the topological signatures of TRS insulators using optical conductivity data.

Title: Boosting superconductivity in ultrathin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ films via nanofaceted substrates
Authors: Eric Wahlberg, Riccardo Arpaia, Debmalya Chakraborty, Alexei Kalaboukhov, David Vignolles, Cyril Proust, Annica M. Black-Schaffer, Thilo Bauch, Götz Seibold, Floriana Lombardi
Abstract: In cuprate high-temperature superconductors the doping level is fixed during synthesis, hence the charge carrier density per CuO$_2$ plane cannot be easily tuned by conventional gating, unlike in 2D materials. Strain engineering has recently emerged as a powerful tuning knob for manipulating the properties of cuprates, in particular charge and spin orders, and their delicate interplay with superconductivity. In thin films, additional tunability can be introduced by the substrate surface morphology, particularly nanofacets formed by substrate surface reconstruction. Here we show a remarkable enhancement of the superconducting onset temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{on}}$ and the upper critical magnetic field $H_{c,2}$ in nanometer-thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films grown on a substrate with a nanofaceted surface. We theoretically show that the enhancement is driven by electronic nematicity and unidirectional charge density waves, where both elements are captured by an additional effective potential at the interface between the film and the uniquely textured substrate. Our findings show a new paradigm in which substrate engineering can effectively enhance the superconducting properties of cuprates. This approach opens an exciting frontier in the design and optimization of high-performance superconducting materials.

Title: VacHopPy: A Python package for vacancy hopping analysis based on molecular dynamics simulations
Authors: Taeyoung Jeong, Kun Hee Ye, Seungjae Yoon, Dohyun Kim, Yunjae Kim, Jung-Hae Choi
Abstract: Multiscale modeling, which integrates material properties from ab initio calculations into continuum-scale simulations, is a promising strategy for optimizing semiconductor devices. However, a key challenge remains: while ab initio methods provide diffusion parameters specific to individual migration paths, continuum equations require a single effective set of parameters that captures the overall diffusion behavior. To address this issue, we present VacHopPy, an open-source Python package for vacancy hopping analysis based on molecular dynamics (MD). VacHopPy extracts an effective set of hopping parameters, including hopping distance, hopping barrier, number of effective paths, correlation factor, and attempt frequency, by statistically integrating energetic, kinetic, and geometric contributions across all paths. It also includes tools for tracking vacancy trajectories and for detecting phase transitions during MD simulations. The applicability of VacHopPy is demonstrated in three representative materials: face-centered cubic Al, rutile TiO2, and monoclinic HfO2. The extracted effective parameters reproduce temperature-dependent diffusion behavior and are in good agreement with previous experimental data. Provided in a simplified form, these parameters are well suited for continuum-scale models and remain valid over a wide temperature range spanning several hundred kelvins. Furthermore, VacHopPy inherently accounts for anisotropy in thermal vibrations, a factor often overlooked, making it suitable for simulating diffusion in complex crystals. Overall, VacHopPy establishes a robust bridge between atomic- and continuum-scale models, enabling more reliable multiscale simulation

Title: Particles, trajectories and diffusion: random walks in cooling granular gases
Authors: Santos Bravo Yuste, Rubén Gómez González, Vicente Garzó
Abstract: We study the mean-square displacement (MSD) of a tracer particle diffusing in a granular gas of inelastic hard spheres under homogeneous cooling state (HCS). Tracer and granular gas particles are in general mechanically different. Our approach uses a series representation of the MSD where the $k$-th term is given in terms of the mean scalar product $\langle \mathbf{r}_1\cdot\mathbf{r}_k \rangle$, with $\mathbf{r}_i$ denoting the displacements of the tracer between successive collisions. We find that this series approximates a geometric series with the ratio $\Omega$. We derive an explicit analytical expression of $\Omega$ for granular gases in three dimensions, and validate it through a comparison with the numerical results obtained from the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Our comparison covers a wide range of masses, sizes, and inelasticities. From the geometric series, we find that the MSD per collision is simply given by the mean-square free path of the particle divided by $1-\Omega$. The analytical expression for the MSD derived here is compared with DSMC data and with the first- and second-Sonine approximations to the MSD obtained from the Chapman-Enskog solution of the Boltzmann equation. Surprisingly, despite their simplicity, our results outperforms the predictions of the first-Sonine approximation to the MSD, achieving accuracy comparable to the second-Sonine approximation.

Title: Machine Learning Framework for Characterizing Processing-Structure Relationship in Block Copolymer Thin Films
Authors: Bradley Lamb, Saroj Upreti, Yunfei Wang, Daniel Struble, Chenhui Zhu, Guillaume Freychet, Xiaodan Gu, Boran Ma
Abstract: The morphology of block copolymers (BCPs) critically influences material properties and applications. This work introduces a machine learning (ML)-enabled, high-throughput framework for analyzing grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) data and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images to characterize BCP thin film morphology. A convolutional neural network was trained to classify AFM images by morphology type, achieving 97% testing accuracy. Classified images were then analyzed to extract 2D grain size measurements from the samples in a high-throughput manner. ML models were developed to predict morphological features based on processing parameters such as solvent ratio, additive type, and additive ratio. GISAXS-based properties were predicted with strong performances ($R^2$ > 0.75), while AFM-based property predictions were less accurate ($R^2$ < 0.60), likely due to the localized nature of AFM measurements compared to the bulk information captured by GISAXS. Beyond model performance, interpretability was addressed using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). SHAP analysis revealed that the additive ratio had the largest impact on morphological predictions, where additive provides the BCP chains with increased volume to rearrange into thermodynamically favorable morphologies. This interpretability helps validate model predictions and offers insight into parameter importance. Altogether, the presented framework combining high-throughput characterization and interpretable ML offers an approach to exploring and optimizing BCP thin film morphology across a broad processing landscape.

Title: Phase transitions and crtical exponents in the six-vertex model on kagome lattices
Authors: Wei Zhang, Wanzhou Zhang, Jie Zhang, Chengxiang Ding, Youjin Deng
Abstract: Inspired by the experimental realization of direct kagome spin ice [Yue et al., Nat. Nanotechnol. 19, 1101 (2024)], the theoretical six-vertex model on the kagome lattice is systematically simulated using the directed loop Monte Carlo method. Four distinct vortex lattice phases are identified: (i) antiferromagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on both triangular and honeycomb faces, with a winding number $k=1$. (ii) ferromagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on both types of faces, with $k=-2$ on the honeycomb faces and $k=1$ on the triangular faces. (iii) paramagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on the triangular faces with $k=1$; and (iv) paramagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on the honeycomb faces with $k=1$. As for ferromagnetic to different types of paramagnetic phase, besides the Ising universality class with $y_t=1$, varying critical exponents have also been found with different values of vertex weights. The transition between the third type and fourth type of vortex lattice phases occurs with the new exponent $y_t=1.340(3)$. The third and fourth types of the vortex lattice phase to the vortex disorder phase are found to be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. These findings contribute to the search for and understanding of ice on complex lattices.

Title: Efficient Band Structure Unfolding with Atom-centered Orbitals: General Theory and Application
Authors: Jingkai Quan, Nikita Rybin, Matthias Scheffler, Christian Carbogno
Abstract: Band structure unfolding is a key technique for analyzing and simplifying the electronic band structure of large, internally distorted supercells that break the primitive cell's translational symmetry. In this work, we present an efficient band unfolding method for atomic orbital (AO) basis sets that explicitly accounts for both the non-orthogonality of atomic orbitals and their atom-centered nature. Unlike existing approaches that typically rely on a plane-wave representation of the (semi-)valence states, we here derive analytical expressions that recasts the primitive cell translational operator and the associated Bloch-functions in the supercell AO basis. In turn, this enables the accurate and efficient unfolding of conduction, valence, and core states in all-electron codes, as demonstrated by our implementation in the all-electron ab initio simulation package FHI-aims, which employs numeric atom-centered orbitals. We explicitly demonstrate the capability of running large-scale unfolding calculations for systems with thousands of atoms and showcase the importance of this technique for computing temperature-dependent spectral functions in strongly anharmonic materials using CuI as example.

Title: Diverse polymorphism in Ruddlesden-Popper chalcogenides
Authors: Prakriti Kayastha, Erik Fransson, Paul Erhart, Lucy Whalley
Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) chalcogenides are stable, non-toxic candidates for optoelectronic or thermoelectric applications. The structural diversity of RP oxides is already exploited to tune properties or achieve more advanced functionalities like multiferroicity, however, little is known about the structural evolution of RP chalcogenides. In this work, we develop a high-accuracy machine-learned interatomic potential to run large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on $Ba_{n+1}Zr_nS_{3n+1}$ for $n=1$ to $n=6$. We predict new polymorphs for each $n$-value, calculate their corresponding phase transition temperatures, and validate our approach through comparison to published experimental results. We find that the $n=1$ phase exhibits negative thermal expansion, that $n=1$ and $n=3$ undergo unusual ascending symmetry breaking, and that phases with $n\geq4$ form layer-dependent tilt patterns previously unreported for inorganic RP materials. This unique behaviour results from competition between octahedral rotations and rumpling at the rocksalt interface, and suggests new strategies for accessing advanced functionalities.

Title: Exact diagonalization study of energy level statistics in harmonically confined interacting bosons
Authors: Mohd Talib, M. A. H. Ahsan
Abstract: We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral properties of bosons harmonically confined in a quasi-2D plane and interacting via repulsive Gaussian potential. We consider the lowest $100$ energy levels for systems of $N=12, 16$ and $20$ bosons in two distinct regimes: (a) when the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy (moderate interaction) and (b) when the interaction energy is comparable to the trap energy (strong interaction), for the non-rotating ($L_{z}=0$) as well as the rotating single-vortex state ($L_{z}=N$). For higher angular momenta, $L_{z}=2N$ and $L_{z}=3N$, only the strong interaction regime is considered. While the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution (NNSD) $P(s)$ and the ratios of consecutive level spacings distribution $P(r)$ are used to study the short-range correlations, the Dyson-Mehta $\Delta_3$ statistic and the level number variance $\Sigma^2(L)$ are used to examine the long-range correlations. In the moderate interaction regime, the non-rotating system exhibits Poisson distribution, a characteristic of the regular energy spectra. In the strong interaction regime, the non-rotating system exhibits chaotic behavior signified by GOE distribution. Furthermore, in the rotating case for the single-vortex state ($L_{z} = N$) in the moderate interaction regime, the system exhibits signatures of weak chaos with some degree of regularity in the energy-level spectra. However, in the strong interaction regime for the rotating case with $L_{z} = N$, $2N$ and $3N$, the system exhibits strong chaotic behavior. The rotation is found to contribute to enhancement of chaotic behavior in the system for both the moderate and the strong interaction regimes. Our results of NNSD analysis are supported by the analysis of the ratios of consecutive level spacings distribution $P(r)$, which does not involve unfolding.

Title: Full counting statistics and first-passage times in quantum Markovian processes: Ensemble relations, metastability, and fluctuation theorems
Authors: Paul Menczel, Christian Flindt, Fredrik Brange, Franco Nori, Clemens Gneiting
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for characterizing fluctuations in quantum transport and nonequilibrium thermodynamics using two complementary approaches: full counting statistics and first-passage times. Focusing on open quantum systems governed by Markovian Lindblad dynamics, we derive general ensemble relations that connect the two approaches at all times, and we clarify how the steady states reached at long times relate to those reached at large jump counts. In regimes of metastability, long-lived intermediate states cause violations of experimentally testable cumulant relations, as we discuss. We also formulate a fluctuation theorem governing the probability of rare fluctuations in the first-passage time distributions based on results from full counting statistics. Our results apply to general integer-valued trajectory observables that do not necessarily increase monotonically in time. Three illustrative applications, a two-state emitter, a driven qubit, and a variant of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, highlight the physical implications of our results and provide guidelines for practical calculations. Our framework provides a complete picture of first-passage time statistics in Markovian quantum systems, encompassing multiple earlier results, and it has direct implications for current experiments in quantum optics, superconducting circuits, and nanoscale heat engines.

Title: Thickness-dependent magnon spin transport in antiferromagnetic insulators: Crossover from quasi-three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional regimes
Authors: Mathias Åsan Myhre, Verena Brehm, Thomas Delvaux, Arne Brataas, Alireza Qaiumzadeh
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of giant room-temperature magnon spin conductivity in an ultrathin ferromagnetic insulator [X.-Y. Wei et al., Nat. Mater. 21, 1352 (2022)], we investigate thickness-dependent magnon spin transport in thin antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs). We study the prototypical AFI hematite, known for its exceptionally low magnetic damping and two distinct magnetic phases: a low-temperature uniaxial easy-axis phase and a high-temperature biaxial easy-plane phase. Using stochastic micromagnetic simulations, we investigate thickness-dependent magnon spin transport across both magnetic phases. Our results uncover a crossover from quasi-three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional magnon spin transport at a critical thickness, determined by the frequency or energy of the excited magnons. Below this critical thickness, we observe a pronounced enhancement in the magnon diffusion length in both magnetic phases. This rise is attributed to a change in the effective magnon density of states, reflecting the reduced phase space available for scattering in the thinner, quasi-two-dimensional regime. Understanding and controlling long-distance magnon spin transport in AFIs is crucial for developing next-generation spintronic nanodevices, especially as materials approach the two-dimensional limit.

Title: Temperature dependence of $p$-wave contacts in a harmonically trapped Fermi gas
Authors: Kenta Nagase, Hikaru Takahashi, Soki Oshima, Takashi Mukaiyama
Abstract: We study the dependence of the $p$-wave contact on the Fermi temperature $T_F$ and reduced temperature $T/T_F$ based on the number of closed-channel molecules. From the anisotropic pattern of dissociated molecules, we resolve the narrow $m=0$ and $m=\pm1$ dipolar splitting of the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance in $^6$Li, enabling the independent determination of the contact for all three $m$ components. For each component, we identify a near-resonant scaling with $\sqrt{T_F}$, indicating the contribution of the normalized effective range $k_F R_{\rm{e}}$. In addition, we show that the peak contacts observed near resonance increase as $T/T_F$ is lowered, a trend that is accurately captured by estimates based on the second-order virial expansion. Our results, together with estimates from the $p$-wave virial expansion, provide a route toward a complete understanding of the thermodynamics of resonantly enhanced $p$-wave Fermi gases.

Title: Higher-Form Anomalies on Lattices
Authors: Yitao Feng, Ryohei Kobayashi, Yu-An Chen, Shinsei Ryu
Abstract: Higher-form symmetry in a tensor product Hilbert space is always emergent: the symmetry generators become genuinely topological only when the Gauss law is energetically enforced at low energies. In this paper, we present a general method for defining the 't Hooft anomaly of higher-form symmetries in lattice models built on a tensor product Hilbert space. In (2+1)D, for given Gauss law operators realized by finite-depth circuits that generate a finite 1-form $G$ symmetry, we construct an index representing a cohomology class in $H^4(B^2G, U(1))$, which characterizes the corresponding 't Hooft anomaly. This construction generalizes the Else-Nayak characterization of 0-form symmetry anomalies. More broadly, under the assumption of a specified formulation of the $p$-form $G$ symmetry action and Hilbert space structure in arbitrary $d$ spatial dimensions, we show how to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly of the symmetry action by an index valued in $H^{d+2}(B^{p+1}G, U(1))$.

Title: Building cluster systems
Authors: Naïmo Davier
Abstract: Classical spin liquids are frustrated magnetic phases characterized by local constraints, flat bands in reciprocal space, and emergent gauge structures with distinctive signatures such as pinch points. These arise generally in \emph{cluster systems}, where spin interactions can be expressed as constraints on clusters of spins. In this work we present the different generic rules allowing to build such cluster systems together with a few tools allowing to quickly characterize it. We show that based on these rules, it is possible to conceive a tunable recipe for generating such models by decorating a parent lattice on its bonds and/or vertices with symmetry-compatible clusters. This approach highlights a key design trade-off: using fewer cluster types increases the number of flat bands and enhances spin-liquid behavior, but produces denser connectivity that is harder to realize experimentally. The framework is highly tunable, extends naturally to two and three dimensions, and provides a versatile toolbox for engineering new classical spin-liquid candidates with targeted features such as higher-rank pinch points or pinch lines. Among the catalog of cluster systems generated following the decoration scheme, a common feature appears to be the existence of additional flat bands in the spectrum, which motivates a detailed study of the origin of these flat bands and their associated physics.

Title: Shear jamming and nonlinear rheology of chocolate suspensions
Authors: Michel Orsi, Veeraj Shah, Mahesh Padmanabhan, Thomas Curwen, Jeffrey F. Morris
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the rheology of dark chocolate pastes in both industrially relevant pre-refined form and simplified model systems. Steady and oscillatory shear experiments reveal yielding, pronounced shear-thinning, and stress-dependent hysteresis governed by solid loading. Fitting the viscosity data with the Maron-Pierce model provides stress-dependent maximum flowable fractions $\phi_{\rm{m}}(\sigma)$, defining yield loci in the $(\phi, \sigma)$ plane. Their variation with stress quantifies the coupled roles of friction and adhesion in setting flow limits. Large-amplitude oscillatory shear tests characterize transitions from elastic to viscous behavior and identify distinct recovery pathways near jamming. Contact-stress decomposition separates hydrodynamic and frictional contributions, confirming that adhesive contact networks dominate stress transmission in pre-refined pastes. These results establish chocolate pastes as dense, adhesive suspensions whose flow is controlled by the interplay of friction and adhesion, offering quantitative benchmarks for constitutive modeling and linking chocolate processing to the broader physics of constraint rheology.

Title: Transverse and Unidirectional Spin Pumping
Authors: Ping Li, Chengyuan Cai, Tao Yu
Abstract: Conventional spin pumping, driven by magnetization dynamics, is longitudinal since the pumped spin current flows normal to the interface between the ferromagnet and the conductor. We predict \textit{Hall-type/transverse} and \textit{unidirectional} spin pumping into conductors by near-field electromagnetic radiation emitted by, \textit{e.g.}, magnetization dynamics. The joint effect of the electric and magnetic fields results in a pure spin current flowing parallel to the interface, i.e., a Hall-type spin pumping, which is highly efficient due to the strong coupling to the electric field. Such a transverse spin current is unidirectional, with the spatial distribution controlled by the magnetization direction. Our finding reveals a robust approach for generating and manipulating spin currents in future low-dimensional spintronic and orbitronic devices.

Title: Pervasive spin-triplet superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene
Authors: Manish Kumar, Derek Waleffe, Anna Okounkova, Raveel Tejani, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Étienne Lantagne-Hurtubise, Joshua Folk, Matthew Yankowitz
Abstract: Magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity once the Zeeman energy exceeds the pairing gap, unless mechanisms such as unconventional pairing, strong spin-orbit coupling, or intrinsic magnetism intervene. Several graphene platforms realize such mitigating routes, exhibiting superconductivity resilient to magnetic fields. Here we report superconductivity in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene that is both induced and stabilized by in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\parallel}$), with critical fields far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The superconductivity spans a wide gate range and emerges from a sharp zero-field resistive ridge that tracks approximately constant conduction band filling. The presence of zero-field superconductivity and the evolution of the critical temperature with $B_{\parallel}$ are highly gate sensitive. We also observe a weak superconducting diode effect in several distinct regimes within the superconducting phase, including nearby to an integer quantum anomalous Hall state generated by a boron nitride moiré superlattice, indicating a potential coexistence of valley imbalance and superconductivity. These results establish several intriguing new properties of spin-triplet, field-induced superconductivity in a thick rhombohedral graphene stack.

Title: Mode-resolved logarithmic quasiballistic heat transport in thin silicon layers: Semianalytic and Boltzmann transport analysis
Authors: Jae Sik Jin
Abstract: Nonequilibrium phonon transport driven by nanoscale hotspot heating in silicon device layers governs heat dissipation in advanced microelectronics and underscores the need for a better microscopic understanding of such processes. Yet the origin of the frequently observed logarithmic (ln) dependence of the apparent thermal response on hotspot size in crystalline silicon, and the role of individual phonon modes in this regime, remain unclear. Here, we develop a semianalytical, mode-resolved framework in the spectral phonon mean free path (MFP) domain and validate it against a full-phonon-dispersion Boltzmann transport model for heat removal from a 10 x 10 nm^2 hotspot in a thin Si layer (thicknesses of 41, 78, and 177 nm) representative of a silicon-on-insulator transistor. We show that ln-type quasiballistic scaling arises only for modes that lie on a log-uniform conductivity plateau and are diffusive-side or quasiballistic with respect to the hotspot size, whereas fully ballistic long-MFP modes contribute a saturated, nonlogarithmic background, leading to extremely slow suppression of their heat-carrying capability. The resulting phonon-modal nonlocal spectrum establishes spectral selection rules for ln-regime transport in confined Si and provides a compact basis for incorporating mode-selective quasiballistic corrections into continuum thermal models and for interpreting phonon-resolved thermometry experiments.

Title: Emergence of a hidden-order phase well below the charge density wave transition in a topological Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I
Authors: Sk Kalimuddin, Sudipta Chatterjee, Arnab Bera, Satyabrata Bera, Deep Singha Roy, Soham Das, Tuhin Debnath, Ashis K. Nandy, Shishir K. Pandey, Mintu Mondal
Abstract: The emergence of a charge density wave (CDW) in a Weyl semimetal -- a correlated topological phase, is exceptionally rare in condensed matter systems. In this context, the quasi-one-dimensional type-III Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I undergoes a CDW transition at $T_{\mathrm{CDW}} \approx 263$~K, providing an exceptional platform to investigate correlated topological CDW states. Here, we uncover an additional hidden-order phase transition at $T^* \sim 100$ K, well below the CDW onset, using low-frequency resistance noise spectroscopy, electrical transport, and thermoelectric measurements. This transition is characterized by a sharp enhancement in the noise exponent ($\alpha$) and variance of resistance fluctuations. Analysis of higher-order statistics of resistance fluctuations reveals the correlated dynamics underlying the transition. A pronounced anomaly in the Seebeck coefficient near $T^*$ further suggests a Fermi surface reconstruction. First-principles calculations reveal a structural distortion from the high-symmetry $I422$ phase to a low-symmetry $C2$ phase, via an intermediate $I4$ symmetry. This leads to renormalization of the electronic structure near the Fermi level and opening of a bandgap in the hidden-order phase. These findings demonstrate a previously unidentified correlated phase transition in the topological CDW-Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I, enriching the phase diagram of this material and establishing it as an ideal platform for studying intertwined electronic and structural orders.

Title: Effect of Underlayer Induced Charge Carrier Substitution on the Superconductivity of Ti40V60 Alloy Thin Films
Authors: Shekhar Chandra Pandey, Shilpam Sharma, Pooja Gupta, L. S. Sharath Chandra, M.K. Chattopadhyay
Abstract: The influence of metallic and semiconducting (V, Al, and Si) under-layer induced charge carrier substitution on the superconducting properties of the Ti40V60 alloy thin films are studied and also compared with a pristine reference film without any under-layer. All the films exhibit metallic behavior in the normal state and a superconducting transition at low temperatures, where the superconducting transition temperature is tunable between 4.77 K and 5.73 K. Hall measurements on the films reveal that the under-layer strongly affects the charge carrier type and density, leading to a correlation between increasing carrier concentration and decreasing TC. The Si under-layer introduces the highest disorder, yet yields the highest TC. This indicates that in the Ti40V60 alloys, a moderate amount of disorder suppresses the spin-fluctuations (inherent to the alloy system) induced pair breaking, thereby enhancing the superconductivity. The comparable TC of the film with V under-layer and the film without under-layer, and the much smaller coherence length (~6.2 nm) as compared to the film thickness (25 nm), confirm the absence of any significant proximity effects. These findings demonstrate that under-layer engineering provides an effective route to tune the superconducting properties of Ti-V alloy thin films.

Title: Effect of hybrid field coupling in nanostructured surfaces on anisotropic signal detection in nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods

Abstract: Anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces and polarization-sensitive spectra have been observed in a number of nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods, including nano-FTIR [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295], photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) [Waeytens et al., Analyst, 2021, 146], tapping AFM-IR [Hondl et al., ACS Meas. Sci. Au, 2025, 5, 469; Luo et al., APL, 2022, 121, 23330], infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR) [Anindo et al., JPCC, 2025, 129, 4517; Shcherbakov et al., Rev Methods Primers, 2025, 5, 1; Ali et al., Anal. Chem., 2025, 97, 23914] and peak force infrared microscopy (PFIR) [Xie et al., JPCC, 2022, 126, 8393; Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution < 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025], which allows, for example, to visualize nanoscale chemical variation on the surface of bacteria cells affected by antimicrobial interaction [Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025]. We compare PiF-IR hyperspectra of aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates and use quantum chemical calculations of the oriented vibrational oscillators to interpret the observations.

Title: Disordered Dynamics in High Dimensions: Connections to Random Matrices and Machine Learning
Authors: Blake Bordelon, Cengiz Pehlevan
Abstract: We provide an overview of high dimensional dynamical systems driven by random matrices, focusing on applications to simple models of learning and generalization in machine learning theory. Using both cavity method arguments and path integrals, we review how the behavior of a coupled infinite dimensional system can be characterized as a stochastic process for each single site of the system. We provide a pedagogical treatment of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), a framework that can be flexibly applied to these settings. The DMFT single site stochastic process is fully characterized by a set of (two-time) correlation and response functions. For linear time-invariant systems, we illustrate connections between random matrix resolvents and the DMFT response. We demonstrate applications of these ideas to machine learning models such as gradient flow, stochastic gradient descent on random feature models and deep linear networks in the feature learning regime trained on random data. We demonstrate how bias and variance decompositions (analysis of ensembling/bagging etc) can be computed by averaging over subsets of the DMFT noise variables. From our formalism we also investigate how linear systems driven with random non-Hermitian matrices (such as random feature models) can exhibit non-monotonic loss curves with training time, while Hermitian matrices with the matching spectra do not, highlighting a different mechanism for non-monotonicity than small eigenvalues causing instability to label noise. Lastly, we provide asymptotic descriptions of the training and test loss dynamics for randomly initialized deep linear neural networks trained in the feature learning regime with high-dimensional random data. In this case, the time translation invariance structure is lost and the hidden layer weights are characterized as spiked random matrices.

Title: Non-Hermitian topological superfluidity in a three-dimensional fermi gas with spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Pingcheng Zhu, Lihong Zhou, Jianxin Zhong
Abstract: The experimental advances in realizing artificial spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and non-Hermitian potentials in ultracold atomic system open a new avenue for exploring their significant roles in quantum many-body physics. Here, we investigate a non-Hermitian, two-component Fermi system in a cubic lattice with Rashba SOC and complex-valued interaction arising from two-body loss. We adopt the non-Hermitian mean field theory and map out the phase diagram at zero temperature. The interplay of dissipation and on-site interaction drives a dissipation-induced phase transition from superfluid (SF) to normal phase (N). Notably, for weak interaction strengths, this leads to a reentrance of the superfluid state. The presence of SOC significantly expands the parameter regime for both the normal phase and the metastable superfluid phase(MSF). Whereas, the Zeeman field can drive the system from a conventional superfluid into a topological superfluid phase(TSF), characterized by a nontrivial topological invariant. These results enrich our knowledge of pairing superfluidity in Fermi systems.

Title: Competing phases and domain structures of ferroelectric perovskites: the benefit of epitaxial (110) growth
Authors: Lan-Tien Hsu, Takeshi Nishimatsu, Anna Grünebohm
Abstract: Strain and domain engineering offer powerful routes to control phase and domain stability in ferroelectric thin films. While most studies have focused on (100)-oriented growth, the impact of lower-symmetry orientations remains underexplored. We address this gap in knowledge with first-principles based molecular dynamics simulation for the example of prototypical ferroelectric perovskites under (110) strain. Epitaxial (110) strains may indeed outperform the widely studied (100) orientation, as even modest strain values stabilize a diverse set of metastable nanoscale states with potential high functional tunability. In this regime, the films exhibit multidomain configurations with domain wall normal oriented along the clamped in-plane or the relaxed out-of-plane directions and heterophases in BaTiO$_3$ and KNbO$_3$. Besides, complex superdomain patterns and antiferroelectric-like domains are observed in PbTiO$_3$. These metastable nanoscale configurations may allow for large reversible responses.

Title: Multiscale Experimental Evidence of a Transitory State in the HDA-LDA Transition in Alumino-sodo-silicate Glasses
Authors: Antoine Cornet, Thierry Deschamps, Sylvie Le Floch, Dominique de Ligny, Christine Martinet
Abstract: The structural evolution with temperature of pure silica (SiO2), sodium-silicate (5Na2O-95SiO2, 10Na2O-90SiO2 and 25Na2O-75SiO2) and albite (15Na2O-15Al2O3-75SiO2) glasses previously densified from hot compression is monitored with a combination of small and wide angle x-ray scattering. Transient scattering maxima in the length scales associated with both techniques indicate the presence of a transitory state, suggesting the classification of the initial and final states as distinct glass states in the context of polyamorphism. In all glasses, a transient intensity peak in the small angle scattering is observed, consistent with the nucleation of a new amorphous state. Based on a comparison with the phenomenology observed in supercooled and glassy water, we propose that this structural evolution provide a strong evidence of the glass polyamorphism as the consequence of the existence of an underlying but thermodynamically defined liquid-liquid transition, independent on the polymerization degree of the system.

Title: Many-body and QED effects in electron-atom inelastic scattering in EELS
Authors: Ioannis Iatrakis, Valerii Brudanin
Abstract: The elemental composition and electronic-structure of materials analyzed by Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) are probed by the inner-shell ionization of atoms. We calculate the inelastic differential cross-section perturbatively within the framework of quantum electrodynamics (QED). The interaction between the incoming electron and the atom factorizes into a high-energy electron term and the atomic transition current. The matrix elements of the transition current are computed within the relaxed Dirac-Hartree-Fock method. We analyze the correlation effects arising from the relaxation of the atomic orbitals induced by the creation of a core hole. These effects are particularly relevant in quantum many-body systems and have a significant impact on the shape of the differential cross-section near the ionization threshold in EELS spectra. This is a localized process that can be approximated by the scattering of an electron beam from a free atom. In addition to the continuum, we calculate the discrete excitation spectrum of $\mathrm{DyScO_3}$ using crystal field multiplet theory. The calculated spectrum shows very good agreement with experimental EELS data.

Title: Near-Term Fermionic Simulation with Subspace Noise Tailored Quantum Error Mitigation
Authors: Miha Papič, Manuel G. Algaba, Emiliano Godinez-Ramirez, Inés de Vega, Adrian Auer, Fedor Šimkovic IV, Alessio Calzona
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) has emerged as a powerful tool for the extraction of useful quantum information from quantum devices. Here, we introduce the Subspace Noise Tailoring (SNT) algorithm, which efficiently combines the cheap cost of Symmetry Verification (SV) and low bias of Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) QEM techniques. We study the performance of our method by simulating the Trotterized time evolution of the spin-1/2 Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) using a variety of local fermion-to-qubit encodings, which define a computational subspace through a set of stabilizers, the measurement of which can be used to post-select noisy quantum data. We study different combinations of QEM and encodings and uncover a rich state diagram of optimal combinations, depending on the hardware performance, system size and available shot budget. We then demonstrate how SNT extends the reach of current noisy quantum computers in terms of the number of fermionic lattice sites and the number of Trotter steps, and quantify the required hardware performance beyond which a noisy device may outperform classical computational methods.

Title: Optimal randomized measurements for a family of non-linear quantum properties
Authors: Zhenyu Du, Yifan Tang, Andreas Elben, Ingo Roth, Jens Eisert, Zhenhuan Liu
Abstract: Quantum learning encounters fundamental challenges when estimating non-linear properties, owing to the inherent linearity of quantum mechanics. Although recent advances in single-copy randomized measurement protocols have achieved optimal sample complexity for specific tasks like state purity estimation, generalizing these protocols to estimate broader classes of non-linear properties without sacrificing optimality remains an open problem. In this work, we introduce the observable-driven randomized measurement (ORM) protocol enabling the estimation of ${\rm Tr}(O\rho^2)$ for an arbitrary observable $O$ -- an essential quantity in quantum computing and many-body physics. We establish an upper bound for ORM's sample complexity and show its optimality for observables with a large trace-norm, including Pauli and local observables, closing a gap in the literature. For these observables, ORM admits an efficient implementation with Clifford circuits. Numerical experiments validate that ORM requires substantially fewer state samples to achieve the same precision compared to classical shadows. Additionally, we introduce a braiding randomized measurement protocol for multiple low-rank non-linear observables, reducing circuit complexities in practical applications.

Title: Machine learning for in-situ composition mapping in a self-driving magnetron sputtering system
Authors: Sanna Jarl, Jens Sjölund, Robert J. W. Frost, Anders Holst, Jonathan J. S. Scragg
Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs), employing automation and machine learning (ML) to accelerate experimental procedures, have enormous potential in the discovery of new materials. However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to solution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access the broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL based on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks, obtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded thin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to systematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven approach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and sputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition distribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ measurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter chamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of the sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using Gaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of the deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of the deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We investigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully Bayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best performance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10 experiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions was verified experimentally. Our framework dramatically increases throughput by avoiding the need for extensive characterisation or calibration, thus demonstrating the potential of ML-guided SDLs to accelerate materials exploration.

Title: Solving Inverse Problems in Stochastic Self-Organizing Systems through Invariant Representations
Authors: Elias Najarro, Nicolas Bessone, Sebastian Risi
Abstract: Self-organizing systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making self-organization central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental challenge in modeling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component, yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modeling method specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space, leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics. We evaluate the method on three self-organizing systems: a physical, a biological, and a social one; namely, a reaction-diffusion system, a model of embryonic development, and an agent-based model of social segregation. We show that the method reliably recovers parameters despite stochasticity in the pattern outcomes. We further apply the method to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex stochastic pattern formation.

Title: What is emergence, after all?
Authors: Abbas K. Rizi
Abstract: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable and physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By refining the concept of emergence, we gain a clearer and more grounded understanding of complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.

Title: Dynamics of the Fermion-Rotor System
Authors: Vazha Loladze, Takemichi Okui, David Tong
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of the fermion-rotor system, a simple impurity model in d=1+1 dimensions that consists of a collection of purely right-moving fermions interacting with a quantum mechanical rotor localised at the origin. This was first introduced by Polchinski as a toy model for monopole-fermion scattering and is surprisingly subtle, with ingoing and outgoing fermions carrying different quantum numbers. We show that the rotor acts as a twist operator in the low-energy theory, changing the quantum numbers of excitations that have previously passed through the origin to ensure scattering consistent with all symmetries. We further show how generalisations of this model with multiple rotors and unequal charges can be viewed as a UV-completion of boundary states for chiral theories, including the well-studied 3450 model. We compute correlation functions between ingoing and outgoing fermions and show that fermions dressed with the rotor degree of freedom act as local operators and create single-particle states, generalising an earlier result obtained in a theory with a single rotor and equal charges. Finally, we point out a mod 2 anomaly in these models that descends from the Witten anomaly in 4d

Title: Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries
Authors: Gerardo Ortiz, Chinmay Giridhar, Philipp Vojta, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy, Zohar Nussinov
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.

Title: From Light Diffusion to Photocatalytic Rates: Compact Scaling Laws for Strongly Scattering Porous Slabs
Authors: Renaud A. L. Vallée, Rénal Backov
Abstract: Light transport in strongly scattering porous photocatalytic materials governs the spatial distribution of absorbed photons and therefore the generation of charge carriers driving photocatalytic reactions. Yet translating measured optical properties of such media into intrinsic reaction rate constants remains challenging, as it requires simultaneously accounting for multiple scattering, boundary losses, photochemical efficiency, and surface kinetics. Here we develop a compact analytical framework that unifies these processes for nanoparticle-loaded photocatalytic slabs. Using a finite-slab diffusion model with extrapolated boundaries, we derive closed-form expressions for the fluence field and couple them to a photochemical quantum efficiency and first-order surface kinetics. The resulting predictors yield intrinsic volumetric and areal rate constants whose dependence on the transport mean free path, optical thickness, and surface-to-volume ratio emerges transparently. Validation against Monte-Carlo photon-migration simulations shows that the diffusion approximation reproduces the fluence and generation-rate profiles with a modest multiplicative mismatch, typically within a factor of about 1.20-1.39, depending on the anisotropy and scattering phase function. This level of agreement is consistent with the known limits of the diffusion approximation and is sufficient to enable reliable, design-oriented predictions. The analytical descriptors introduced here, such as l*, S/V and the extrapolation length zb are general, physically interpretable, and directly integrable into data-driven optimisation and geometry-engineered reactor design. The framework thus provides a versatile and physically grounded tool for photocatalytic systems across diverse applications, including VOC photo-degradation, indoor air purification, and solar-fuel production.

Title: Initial-State Typicality in Quantum Relaxation
Authors: Ruicheng Bao
Abstract: Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and technologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a central, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing the relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality phenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly initial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions. Crucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a size-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open quantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used quantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit re-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong Mpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual advances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to accelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements conventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation.

Title: Universal and non-universal facets of quantum critical phenomena unveiled along the Schmidt decomposition theorem
Authors: Samuel M. Soares, Lucas Squillante, Henrique S. Lima, Constantino Tsallis, Mariano de Souza
Abstract: Critical phenomena have been extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally in many fields, such as condensed matter physics, biology, e.g., brain criticality, and cosmology. In particular, the behaviour of response functions right at critical points (CPs) is highly topical. It turns out that in the frame of Boltzmann-Gibbs-von Neumann-Shannon approach, the extensive character of entropy breaks down at CPs. The latter implies diverging susceptibilities, which is at odds with experimental observations. Here, we investigate the influence of the spin magnitude $S$ on the quantum Grüneisen parameter $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ right at CPs for the 1D Ising model under a transverse magnetic field. Our findings are fourfold: $\textit{i}$) for higher $S$, $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ is increased, but remains finite, reflecting the enhancement of the Hilbert space dimensionality; $\textit{ii}$) the Schmidt decomposition theorem recovers the extensivity of the nonadditive $q$-entropy $S_q$ only for a $\textit{special}$ value of the entropic index $q$; $\textit{iii}$) the universality class in the frame of $S_q$ depends only on the symmetry of the system; $\textit{iv}$) we propose an experimental setup to explore finite-size effects in connection with the Hilbert space occupation at CPs. Our findings unveil both universal and non-universal aspects of quantum criticality in terms of $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ and $S_q$.
