Title: Near-surface Defects Break Symmetry in Water Adsorption on CeO$_{2-x}$(111)
Authors: Oscar Custance, Manuel González Lastre, Kyungmin Kim, Estefanía Fernandez-Villanueva, Pablo Pou, Masayuki Abe, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Shigeki Kawai, M. Verónica Ganduglia-Pirovano, Rubén Pérez
Abstract: Water interactions with oxygen-deficient cerium dioxide (CeO$_2$) surfaces are central to hydrogen production and catalytic redox reactions, but the atomic-scale details of how defects influence adsorption and reactivity remain elusive. Here, we unveil how water adsorbs on partially reduced CeO$_{2-x}$(111) using atomic force microscopy (AFM) with chemically sensitive, oxygen-terminated probes, combined with first-principles calculations. Our AFM imaging reveals water molecules as sharp, asymmetric boomerang-like features radically departing from the symmetric triangular motifs previously attributed to molecular water. Strikingly, these features localize near subsurface defects. While the experiments are carried out at cryogenic temperature, water was dosed at room temperature, capturing configurations relevant to initial adsorption events in catalytic processes. Density functional theory identifies Ce$^{3+}$ sites adjacent to subsurface vacancies as the thermodynamically favored adsorption sites, where defect-induced symmetry breaking governs water orientation. Force spectroscopy and simulations further distinguish Ce$^{3+}$ from Ce$^{4+}$ centers through their unique interaction signatures. By resolving how subsurface defects control water adsorption at the atomic scale, this work demonstrates the power of chemically selective AFM for probing site-specific reactivity in oxide catalysts, laying the groundwork for direct investigations of complex systems such as single-atom catalysts, metal-support interfaces, and defect-engineered oxides.

Title: Beyond one-loop: higher-order effects on Gross-Neveu-Yukawa tensorial criticality
Authors: SangEun Han, Igor F. Herbut
Abstract: We study the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the SO($N$) symmetric traceless rank-two tensor order parameter coupled to Majorana fermions using the $\epsilon$-expansion around upper critical dimensions of $3+1$ to two loops. Previously we established in the one-loop calculation that the theory does not exhibit a critical fixed point for $N \geq 4$, but that nevertheless the stable fixed point inevitably emerges at a large number of fermion flavors $N_f$. For $N_f < N_{f,c1} \approx N/2$, no critical fixed point exists; for $N_{f,c1} < N_f < N_{f,c2}$, a real critical fixed point emerges from the complex plane but fails to satisfy the additional stability conditions necessary for a continuous phase transition; and finally only for $N_f > N_{f,c2} \approx N$, the fixed point satisfies the stability conditions as well. In the present work we compute the $O(\epsilon)$ (two-loop) corrections to the critical flavour numbers $N_{f,c1} $ and $N_{f,c2}$. Most importantly, we observe a sharp decrease in $N_{f,c2}$ from its one-loop value, which brings it closer to the point $N_f =1$ relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Some three-loop results are also presented and discussed.

Title: Quantized Chern-Simons Axion Coupling in Anomalous Floquet Systems
Authors: Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Nathan Goldman, Gonzalo Usaj
Abstract: Quantized bulk response functions are hallmark signatures of topological phases, but their manifestation in periodically driven (Floquet) systems is not yet fully established. Here, we show that two-dimensional anomalous Floquet systems exhibit a quantized bulk response encoded in a Chern-Simons axion (CSA) coupling angle, reflecting a topological magnetoelectric effect analogous to that in three-dimensional insulators. The periodic drive introduces an emergent "photon" dimension, allowing the system to be viewed as a three-dimensional Sambe lattice. Within this framework, cross-correlated responses such as photon-space polarization and magnetization density, emerge as physical signatures of the CSA coupling. The CSA angle, constructed from the non-Abelian Berry connection of Floquet states, admits a natural interpretation in terms of the geometry of hybrid Wannier states. These results provide a unified framework linking Floquet band topology to quantized bulk observables.

Title: Tuning between a fractional topological insulator and competing phases at $ν_\mathrm{T}=2/3$
Authors: Roger Brunner, Titus Neupert, Glenn Wagner
Abstract: We study a spinful, time-reversal symmetric lowest Landau level model for a flatband quantum spin Hall system at total filling fraction $\nu_\mathrm{T}=2/3$. Such models are relevant, e.g. for spin-valley locked moiré transition metal dichalcogenides. The opposite Chern number of the two spins hinders the formation of a quantum Hall ferromagnet, instead favouring other phases. We study the phase diagram in dependence on different short-range Haldane pseudopotentials $V_m$ and uncover several phases: A fractional topological insulator, a phase separated state, a spin-polarized fractional quantum Hall state, and the partially particle-hole transformed Halperin (111) state. The effect of the pseudopotentials $V_m$ depends on the parity of $m$, the relative angular momentum.

Title: Ultrahigh Anomalous Nernst Thermopower and Thermal Hall Angle in YbMnBi2
Authors: Jiamin Wen, Kaustuv Manna, Dung Vu, Subhadeep Bej, Yu Pan, Claudia Felser, Brian Skinner, Joseph P. Heremans
Abstract: Thermoelectrics (TEs) are solid-state devices that can realize heat-electricity conversion. Transverse TEs require materials with a large Nernst effect, which typically requires a strong applied magnetic field. However, topological materials with magnetic order offer an alternative pathway for achieving large Nernst via the anomalous Hall effect and the accompanying anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) that arise from band topology. Here, we show that YbMnBi2 with a low Hall density and a chemical potential near the Weyl points has, to the best of our knowledge, the highest ANE-dominated Nernst thermopower of any magnetic material, with $S_{yx}$ around 110 $\mu$V/K ($T$ = 254 K, 5 T < $|\mu_0 H|$ < 9 T applied along the spin canting direction), due to the synergism between classical contributions from filled electron bands, large Hall conductivity of topological origin, and large resistivity anisotropy. An appreciable thermal Hall angle of $0.02 < (\nabla_y T)/(\nabla_x T) < 0.06$ was observed (40 K < $T$ < 310 K, $\mu_0 H$ = 9 T).

Title: Pairing symmetry and superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films
Authors: Wenyuan Qiu, Zhihui Luo, Xunwu Hu, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature $T_c$ over 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks an important step in the field of nickelate superconductors. Here, we perform a renormalized mean-field theory study of the superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ thin films, using a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model. Our result reveals an $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry driven by the strong interlayer superexchange coupling of $d_{z^2}$ orbital, resembling the pressurized bulk case. Also, we roughly reproduce the experimentally reported nodeless shape of the superconducting gap at the $\beta$ pocket and the superconducting $T_c$. To gain insight into the orbital feature of superconductivity, we explore the projection of different pairing bonds on Fermi surface. We find that the nodeless gap at $\beta$ pocket is related to the interlayer pairing within both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, in which the latter is triggered by the former through hybridization, and both hold the same sign.

Title: Bosonized theory of de Haas-van Alphen quantum oscillation in Fermi liquids
Authors: Yuxuan Wang
Abstract: The de Haas-van Alphen effect (dHvA) of a 2d Fermi liquid remains poorly understood, due to the $\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ contribution to the oscillations of grand potential from the oscillatory part of the fermionic self energy, which has no known closed-form solution. In this work, we solve this problem via coadjoint-orbit bosonization of the Fermi surface. Compared with the fermionic formalism, the issue of the oscillatory self energy is circumvented. As an effective field theory, Landau parameters $F_{n}$ directly enter the theory. We use the bosonized theory to derive the energies of cyclotron resonance and specific heat, which are consistent with Fermi liquid theory. Via a mode expansion, we show that the problem of dHvA is reduced to 0+1D quantum mechanics. We obtain analytic expressions for the behavior of dHvA at low and high temperatures, which deviate from the well-known Lifshitz-Kosevich formula. We contrast this behavior with that of 3d Fermi liquids, for which we show such deviations are parametrically small. We discuss the effects of disorder on dHvA within the bosonized theory.

Title: The Interacting Energy Bands of Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene Revealed by the Quantum Twisting Microscope
Authors: J. Xiao, A. Inbar, J. Birkbeck, N. Gershon, Y. Zamir, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, E. Berg, S. Ilani
Abstract: Electron interactions in quantum materials fundamentally shape their energy bands and, with them, the material's most intriguing quantum phases. Magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has emerged as a model system, where flat bands give rise to a variety of such phases, yet the precise nature of these bands has remained elusive due to the lack of high-resolution momentum space probes. Here, we use the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) to directly image the interacting energy bands of MATBG with unprecedented momentum and energy resolution. Away from the magic angle, the observed bands closely follow the single-particle theory. At the magic angle, however, we observe bands that are completely transformed by interactions, exhibiting light and heavy electronic character at different parts of momentum space. Upon doping, the interplay between these light and heavy components gives rise to a variety of striking phenomena, including interaction-induced bandwidth renormalization, Mott-like cascades of the heavy particles, and Dirac revivals of the light particles. We also uncover a persistent low-energy excitation tied to the heavy sector, suggesting a new unaccounted degree of freedom. These results resolve the long-standing puzzle in MATBG - the dual nature of its electrons - by showing that it originates from electrons at different momenta within the same topological heavy fermion-like flat bands. More broadly, our results establish the QTM as a powerful tool for high-resolution spectroscopic studies of quantum materials previously inaccessible to conventional techniques.

Title: Symmetry Classification of Magnetic Orders and Emergence of Spin-Orbit Magnetism
Authors: Yuntian Liu, Xiaobing Chen, Yutong Yu, Qihang Liu
Abstract: Magnetism, a fundamental concept predating condensed matter physics, has achieved significant advancements in recent decades, driven by its potential for next-generation storage devices. Meanwhile, the classification of magnetic orders, even for the most fundamental concepts like ferromagnetism (FM) and antiferromagnetism (AFM), has encountered unprecedented challenges since the discovery of unconventional magnets and advancements in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we present a rigorous classification of magnetic order using state-of-the-art spin space group (SSG) theory. Based on whether the net magnetic moment is constrained to zero by SSG, magnetic order is unambiguously dichotomized into FM (including ferrimagnetism) and AFM. Additionally, we classify AFM geometries into four categories -- primary, bi-color, spiral, and multi-axial -- based on periodic spin propagation beyond the symmetry operations of magnetic space groups. We then introduce a distinct magnetic phase, dubbed spin-orbit magnetism, characterized by its unique behavior involving the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) order parameter and SOC-driven phase transition. We further create an oriented SSG description, i.e., SSG with a fixed magnetic configuration, apply the framework to 2,065 experimentally validated magnetic materials in MAGNDATA database, and identify over 220 spin-orbit magnets with distinct spin and orbital magnetization mechanisms. Implemented by the online program FINDSPINGROUP, our work establishes a universal symmetry standard for magnetic order classification, offering new understandings of unconventional magnets and broad applicability in spintronics and quantum material design.

Title: Pull-off strength of mushroom-shaped fibrils adhered to rigid substrates
Authors: C. Betegón, C. Rodríguez, E. Martínez-Pañeda, R.M. McMeeking
Abstract: The exceptional adhesion properties of biological fibrillar structures -- such as those found in geckos -- have inspired the development of synthetic adhesive surfaces. Among these, mushroom-shaped fibrils have demonstrated superior pull-off strength compared to other geometries. In this study, we employ a computational approach based on a Dugdale cohesive zone model to analyze the detachment behavior of these fibrils when adhered to a rigid substrate. The results provide complete pull-off curves, revealing that the separation process is inherently unstable under load control, regardless of whether detachment initiates at the fibril edge or center. Our findings show that fibrils with a wide, thin mushroom cap effectively reduce stress concentrations and promote central detachment, leading to enhanced adhesion. However, detachment from the center is not observed in all geometries, whereas edge detachment can occur under certain conditions in all cases. Additionally, we investigate the impact of adhesion defects at the fibril center, showing that they can significantly reduce pull-off strength, particularly at high values of the dimensionless parameter \c{hi}. These insights contribute to the optimization of bio-inspired adhesives and microstructured surfaces for various engineering applications.

Title: From the dynamic to the static glass transition via hypersonic measurements using Brillouin spectroscopy
Authors: Jan-Kristian Krüger, Rafael J. Jiménez Riobóo, Bernd Wetzel, Andreas Klingler
Abstract: For the fragile, low-molecular-weight liquid diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA), we report on the dynamic glass transition and a further acoustic anomaly in the vicinity of the thermal glass transition based on hypersonic investigations of the longitudinal elastic modulus using Brillouin spectroscopy. This additional acoustic anomaly of the longitudinally polarized phonon is confirmed by the occurrence of an anomaly of the shear phonon at the same thermal glass transition temperature. Analysis of the generalized Cauchy relation suggests that both anomalies are coupled to a glass transition phenomenon independent of the so-called {\alpha}-relaxation process.

Title: BaCd2P2: a defect-resistant "GaAs"
Authors: Gideon Kassa, Zhenkun Yuan, Muhammad R. Hasan, Guillermo L. Esparza, David P. Fenning, Geoffroy Hautier, Kirill Kovnir, Jifeng Liu
Abstract: BaCd2P2 (BCP) has recently been identified as a promising solar absorber with excellent optoelectronic properties. Here we demonstrate the defect tolerance in BCP by comparing its optoelectronic quality with that of the well studied absorber GaAs. Despite having a low precursor purity, our synthesized BCP samples exhibit a bright band-to-band room-temperature photoluminescence intensity, an implied open-circuit voltage of 1.0 V at AM1.5, and a carrier lifetime of about 300 ns, all higher than those of GaAs samples obtained from a high-purity single-crystalline wafer. In contrast, GaAs samples synthesized using similar methods as BCP show no band-to-band photoluminescence emissions. To understand the higher optoelectronic quality of BCP, we perform first-principles defect calculations and show that BCP has a much lower Shockley-Read-Hall nonradiative recombination rate compared to GaAs. Our results reveal robust impurity and defect tolerance in BCP, demonstrating its high photovoltaic potential.

Title: Nonequilibrium quench dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates of microwave-shielded polar molecules
Authors: Abdelaali Boudjemaa
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of homogeneous ultracold Bose gases of microwave-shielded polar molecules following a sudden quench of the scattering length at zero temperature. We calculate in particular the quantum depletion, the anomalous density, the condensate fluctuations, and the pair correlation function using both the time-dependent Bogoliubov approach and the self-consistent time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation. During their time evolution, these quantities exhibit slow or fast oscillations depending on the strength of the shielding interactions. We find that at long time scales the molecular condensate is characterized by nonequilibrium steady-state momentum distribution functions, with depletion, anomalous density and correlations that deviate from their corresponding equilibrium values. We demonstrate that the pair correlations expand diffusively at short times while they spread ballistically at long times.

Title: Uncertainty-Aware Machine-Learning Framework for Predicting Dislocation Plasticity and Stress-Strain Response in FCC Alloys
Authors: Jing Luo, Yejun Gu, Yanfei Wang, Xiaolong Ma, Jaafar.A El-Awady
Abstract: Machine learning has significantly advanced the understanding and application of structural materials, with an increasing emphasis on integrating existing data and quantifying uncertainties in predictive modeling. This study presents a comprehensive methodology utilizing a mixed density network (MDN) model, trained on extensive experimental data from literature. This approach uniquely predicts the distribution of dislocation density, inferred as a latent variable, and the resulting stress distribution at the grain level. The incorporation of statistical parameters of those predicted distributions into a dislocation-mediated plasticity model allows for accurate stress-strain predictions with explicit uncertainty quantification. This strategy not only improves the accuracy and reliability of mechanical property predictions but also plays a vital role in optimizing alloy design, thereby facilitating the development of new materials in a rapidly evolving industry.

Title: Deciphering Chiral Superconductivity via Impurity Bound States
Authors: Yuchang Cai, Rui-Xing Zhang
Abstract: Determining the symmetry of Cooper pairs remains a central challenge in the study of unconventional superconductors, particularly for chiral states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that point-like impurities in chiral superconductors generate in-gap bound states with a distinctive asymmetry: the local density of states at the impurity site vanishes at one bound-state energy, but not at its particle-hole conjugate. We prove this behavior analytically in generic two-dimensional, single-band chiral superconductors, showing it arises from a fundamental interplay between pairing chirality and crystalline rotation symmetry. Our numerical simulations confirm that this diagnostic feature persists in multiband systems and for spatially extended impurities. Our results establish a symmetry-enforced real-space diagnostic for chiral superconductivity at the atomic scale.

Title: High Temperature Quantum Emission from Covalently Functionalized van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: S. Carin Gavin, Hsun-Jen Chuang, Anushka Dasgupta, Moumita Kar, Kathleen M. McCreary, Sung-Joon Lee, M. Iqbal Bakti Utama, Xiangzhi Li, George C. Schatz, Tobin J. Marks, Mark C. Hersam, Berend T. Jonker, Nathaniel P. Stern
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are attractive nanomaterials for quantum information applications due to single photon emission (SPE) from atomic defects, primarily tungsten diselenide (WSe2) monolayers. Defect and strain engineering techniques have been developed to yield high purity, deterministically positioned SPE in WSe2. However, a major challenge in application of these techniques is the low temperature required to observe defect-bound TMD exciton emission, typically limiting SPE to T<30 K. SPE at higher temperatures either loses purity or requires integration into complex devices such as optical cavities. Here, 2D heterostructure engineering and molecular functionalization are combined to achieve high purity (>90%) SPE in strained WSe2 persisting to over T=90 K. Covalent diazonium functionalization of graphite in a layered WSe2/graphite heterostructure maintains high purity up to T=90 K and single-photon source integrity up to T=115 K. This method preserves the best qualities of SPE from WSe2 while increasing working temperature to more than three times the typical range. This work demonstrates the versatility of surface functionalization and heterostructure design to synergistically improve the properties of quantum emission and offers new insights into the phenomenon of SPE from 2D materials.

Title: Dynamically emergent correlations in a Brownian gas with diffusing diffusivity
Authors: Nikhil Mesquita, Satya N. Majumdar, Sanjib Sabhapandit
Abstract: We study a gas of $N$ Brownian particles in the presence of a common stochastic diffusivity $D(t)=B^2(t)$, where $B(t)$ represents a one-dimensional Brownian motion at time $t$. Starting with all the particles from the origin, the gas expands ballistically. We show that because of the common stochastic diffusivity, the expanding gas gets dynamically correlated, and the joint probability density function of the position of the particles has a conditionally independent and identically distributed (CIID) structure that was recently found in several other systems. The special CIID structure allows us to compute the average density profile of the gas, extreme and order statistics, gap distribution between successive particles, and the full counting statistics (FCS) that describes the probability density function (PDF) $H(\kappa, t)$ of the fraction of particles $\kappa$ in a given region $[-L,L]$. Interestingly, the position fluctuation of the central particles and the average density profiles are described by the same scaling function. The PDF describing the FCS has an essential singularity near $\kappa=0$, indicating the presence of particles inside the box $[-L,L]$ at all times. Near the upper limit $\kappa =1$, the scaling function $H(\kappa,t)$ has a rather unusual behavior: $H(\kappa,t)\sim (1-\kappa)^{\beta(t)}$ where the exponent $\beta(t)$ changes continuously with time. While at early times $\beta(t)<0$ indicating a divergence of $H(\kappa,t)$ as $\kappa\to 1$, $\beta(t)$ becomes positive for $t>t_c$ where $t_c$ is computed exactly. For $t>t_c$, the scaling function $H(\kappa,t)$ vanishes as $\kappa\to 1$, indicating that it is highly unlikely to have all the particles in the interval $[-L,L]$. Exactly at $t=t_c$, $\beta=0$, indicating that the PDF approaches a non-zero constant as $\kappa\to 1$. Thus, as a function of $t$, the FCS exhibits an interesting shape transition.

Title: Superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled BaBi$_3$ formed by \textit{in situ} reduction of bismuthate films
Authors: Shama, Jordan T. McCourt, Merve Baksi, Gleb Finkelstein, Divine Kumah
Abstract: Oxygen-scavenging at oxide heterointerfaces has emerged as a powerful route for stabilizing metastable phases that exhibit interesting phenomena, including high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases and high T$_{c}$ superconductivity. We investigate structural and chemical interactions at the heterointerface formed between Eu metal and the charged-ordered insulator, BaBiO$_3$, which leads to emergent superconductivity at 6 K. A combination of X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy measurements shows that oxygen scavenging by the Eu adlayer leads to the formation of EuO$_x$ and the superconducting intermetallic BaBi$_3$. The superconducting state is quasi-two-dimensional, as evidenced by the angle-dependent magnetotransport measurements and current-voltage characteristics. An in-plane upper critical field B$_{c2}$ significantly exceeding the Pauli paramagnetic limit is observed, possibly reflecting features of Ising superconductivity. The strong spin-orbit coupling at the Bi sites may pave the way for the realization of high-T$_{c}$ topological superconductivity.

Title: Influence and information in a collective of self-propelled particles
Authors: Jiahuan Pang, Wendong Wang
Abstract: While information-theoretic quantities, such as transfer entropy, have been widely adopted to infer causal relationships in collective systems, a critical gap exists: the absence of quantitative evidence directly linking information-theoretic quantities to a physically defined influence. This letter addresses this gap by proposing a modified Vicsek model that enables the calculation of a physically interpretable influence grounded in the angular interactions between particles. Averaged pairwise influences can serve as new order parameters to indicate collective phase transitions. We reveal quantitative relations between information, represented by transfer entropy, and average influence in pairwise and collective interactions. We test three typical methods of partial information decomposition and find that the method based on intrinsic mutual information gives the most appropriate interpretation. Overall, this work provides a model system for quantitative studies of influence and information in complex systems.

Title: Energetic and Structural Properties of Two-Dimensional Trapped Mesoscopic Fermi Gases
Authors: Emma K. Laird, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Jia Wang, Matthew J. Davis
Abstract: We theoretically investigate equal-mass spin-balanced two-component Fermi gases in which pairs of atoms with opposite spins interact via a short-range isotropic model potential. We probe the distinction between two-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional harmonic confinement by tuning the effective range parameter within two-dimensional scattering theory. Our approach, which yields numerically exact energetic and structural properties, combines a correlated Gaussian basis-set expansion with the stochastic variational method. For systems containing up to six particles, we: 1) Present the ground- and excited-state energy spectra; 2) Study non-local correlations by analysing the one- and two-body density matrices, extracting from these the occupation numbers of the natural orbitals, the momentum distributions of atoms and pairs, and the molecular 'condensate fraction'; 3) Study local correlations by computing the radial and pair distribution functions. This paper extends current theoretical knowledge on the properties of trapped few-fermion systems as realised in state-of-the-art cold-atom experiments.

Title: Confusion-driven machine learning of structural phases of a flexible, magnetic Stockmayer polymer
Authors: Dilina Perera, Samuel McAllister, Joan Josep Cerdà, Thomas Vogel
Abstract: We use a semi-supervised, neural-network based machine learning technique, the confusion method, to investigate structural transitions in magnetic polymers, which we model as chains of magnetic colloidal nanoparticles characterized by dipole-dipole and Lennard-Jones interactions. As input for the neural network we use the particle positions and magnetic dipole moments of equilibrium polymer configurations, which we generate via replica-exchange Wang--Landau simulations. We demonstrate that by measuring the classification accuracy of neural networks, we can effectively identify transition points between multiple structural phases without any prior knowledge of their existence or location. We corroborate our findings by investigating relevant, conventional order parameters. Our study furthermore examines previously unexplored low-temperature regions of the phase diagram, where we find new structural transitions between highly ordered helicoidal polymer configurations.

Title: Electric field-induced clustering in nanocomposite films of highly polarizable inclusions
Authors: Elshad Allahyarov, Hartmut Löwen
Abstract: A nanocomposite film containing highly polarizable inclusions in a fluid background is explored when an external electric field is applied perpendicular to the planar film. For small electric fields, the induced dipole moments of the inclusions are all polarized in field direction, resulting in a mutual repulsion between the inclusions. Here we show that this becomes qualitatively different for high fields: the total system self-organizes into a state which contains both polarizations, parallel and antiparallel to the external field such that a fraction of the inclusions is counter-polarized to the electric field direction. We attribute this unexpected counter-polarization to the presence of neighboring dipoles which are highly polarized and locally revert the direction of the total electric field. Since dipoles with opposite moments are attractive, the system shows a wealth of novel equilibrium structures for varied inclusion density and electric field strength. These include fluids and solids with homogeneous polarizations as well as equilibrium clusters and demixed states with two different polarization signatures. Based on computer simulations of a linearized polarization model, our results can guide the control of nanocomposites for various applications, including sensing external fields, directing light within plasmonic materials, and controlling the functionality of biological membranes.

Title: Electronic conduction in copper-graphene composites with functional impurities
Authors: Kishor Nepal, Ridwan Hussein, Yahya Al-Majali, David Drabold
Abstract: Coal-derived graphene-like material and its addition to FCC copper are investigated using ab initio plane wave density functional theory (DFT). We explore ring disorder in the sp2 carbon, and functional impurities such as oxides (-O), and hydroxides (-OH) that are common in coal-derived graphene. The electronic density of states analysis revealed localized states near the Fermi level, with functional groups contributing predominantly to states below the Fermi level, while carbon atoms in non-hexagonal rings contributed mainly to states above it. The functionalization of graphene induces charge localization while ring disorder disrupts the continuous flow of electrons. By projecting the electronic conductivity along specific spatial directions, we find that both the crystal orientation and the graphene purity significantly influence the anisotropy and magnitude of electronic transport in the composites. This study implicitly highlights the importance of structural stress to obtain improved electrical conductivity in such composites.

Title: High-Throughput Mapping of Magnetic Properties via the on-the-fly XMCD spectroscopy in a Combinatorial Fe-Co-Ni Film
Authors: Y. Yamasaki, N. Sasabe, Y. Ishii, Y. Sekiguchi, A. Sumiyoshiya, Y. Tanimoto, Y. Kotani, T. Nakamura, H. Nomura
Abstract: High-throughput X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) spectroscopy was conducted on Fe-Co-Ni compositionally graded films to systematically analyze the variation of magnetic properties as a function of composition. On-the-fly XMCD measurement enabled rapid spectral acquisition. Measurement time was reduced approximately tenfold compared to conventional stepwise methods, while maintaining high precision. The obtained XMCD spectra were processed using the Savitzky-Golay denoising technique, and element-specific magnetic properties were extracted using XMCD sum rules. By mapping the orbital and spin magnetic moments across the composition gradient, we identified key regions exhibiting enhanced soft magnetic properties. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of high-throughput synchrotron-based spectroscopy for accelerating materials discovery and optimizing functional magnetic materials.

Title: The electronic structures, magnetic transition and Fermi surface instability of room-temperature altermagnet KV$_{2}$Se$_{2}$O
Authors: Yuanji Xu, Huiyuan Zhang, Maoyuan Feng, Fuyang Tian
Abstract: Altermagnetism has recently emerged as a distinct and fundamental class of magnetic order. Exploring its interplay with quantum phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, density-wave instabilities, and many-body effects represents a compelling frontier. In this work, we theoretically confirm the presence of high-temperature metallic altermagnetism in KV$_2$Se$_2$O. We demonstrate that the anomalous metal-insulator-metal transition arises from a Lifshitz transition associated with Fermi surface reconstruction. The previously reported spin-density wave gap is found to lie below the Fermi level in our study and is now recognized to be attributed to the V-shaped density of states, originating from orbital-selective and sublattice-resolved half-metal-like behavior on a specific V atom. Furthermore, we identify the instability from the nesting of spin-momentum-locked two-dimensional Fermi surfaces, which induces the SDW state. These findings position KV$_2$Se$_2$O as a promising platform for investigating the interplay among altermagnetism, unconventional superconductivity, and density-wave order.

Title: All-electric control of skyrmion-bimeron transition in van der Waals heterostructures
Authors: Lan Bo, Songli Dai, Xichao Zhang, Masahito Mochizuki, Xiaohong Xu, Zean Tian, Yan Zhou
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals materials offer a versatile platform for manipulating atomic-scale topological spin textures. In this study, using first-principles and micromagnetic calculations, we demonstrate a reversible transition between magnetic skyrmions and bimerons in a MoTeI/In_2Se_3 multiferroic heterostructure. The physical origin lies in the reorientation of the easy axis of magnetic anisotropy, triggered by the reversal of ferroelectric polarization. We show that the transition operates effectively under both static and dynamic conditions, exhibiting remarkable stability and flexibility. Notably, this transition can be achieved entirely through electric control, without requiring any external magnetic field. Furthermore, we propose a binary encoding scheme based on the skyrmion-bimeron transition, presenting a promising path toward energy-efficient spintronic applications.

Title: Modeling active nematics via the nematic locking principle
Authors: Kevin A. Mitchell, Md Mainul Hasan Sabbir, Sean Ricarte, Brandon Klein, Daniel A. Beller
Abstract: Active nematic systems consist of rod-like internally driven subunits that interact with one another to form large-scale coherent flows. They are important examples of far-from-equilibrium fluids, which exhibit a wealth of nonlinear behavior. This includes active turbulence, in which topological defects braid around one another in a chaotic fashion. One of the most studied examples of active nematics is a dense two-dimensional layer of microtubules, crosslinked by kinesin molecular motors that inject extensile deformations into the fluid. Though numerous studies have modeled microtubule-based active nematics, no consensus has emerged on how to fully capture the features of the experimental system. To better understand the foundations for modeling this system, we propose a fundamental principle we call the nematic locking principle: individual microtubules cannot rotate without all neighboring microtubules also rotating. Physically, this is justified by the high density of the microtubules, their elongated nature, and their corresponding steric interactions. We assert that nematic locking holds throughout the majority of the material but breaks down in the neighborhood of topological defects and other regions of low density. We derive the most general nematic transport equation consistent with this principle and also derive the most general term that violates it. We examine the standard Beris-Edwards approach used to model this system and show that it violates nematic locking throughout the majority of the material. We then propose a modification to the Beris-Edwards model that enforces nematic locking nearly everywhere. This modification shuts off fracturing except in regions where the order parameter is reduced. The resulting simulations show strong nematic locking throughout the bulk of the material, consistent with experimental observation.

Abstract: Considerable inroads have recently been made on algorithms to determine the sample potential from four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy data from thick samples where multiple scattering cannot be neglected. This paper further develops the scattering matrix approach to such structure determination. Through simulation, we demonstrate how this approach can be modified to better handle partial spatial coherence, unknown probe defocus, and information from the dark field region. By combining these developments we reconstruct the electrostatic potential of a monolithic SrTiO$_3$ crystal showing good quantitative agreement with the expected structure.

Abstract: Atomic-scale ferroelectric thin films hold great promise for high-density, low-power applications but face stability and voltage scaling challenges at extreme thinness. Here, we demonstrate ferroelectricity in single-crystalline two-dimensional (2D) Ga$_2$O$_3$, an ultra-wide-bandgap semiconductor, at just 6 angstrom thickness, exhibiting exceptional retention and thermal stability. We show that epitaxial beta-Ga$_2$O$_3$ can be exfoliated down to a half-unit cell thickness via a self-limiting mechanism, enabling a biaxial strain-induced phase transition into a novel ferroelectric layered structure. Strain modulation enables the reduction of polarization switching voltage to 0.8 V, meeting CMOS voltage scaling requirements. Theoretical calculations reveal that switching is driven by covalent bond reconstruction, effectively countering depolarization and enhancing stability. Additionally, we integrate ferroelectric 2D Ga$_2$O$_3$ onto silicon using a low-temperature, back-end-of-line-compatible process. This work advances the exploration of sub-nanometer ferroelectrics, paving the way for high-density, low-power, non-volatile applications seamlessly integrated with advanced silicon technology.

Title: Theory of the Anderson transition in three-dimensional chiral symmetry classes: Connection to type-II superconductors
Authors: Pengwei Zhao, Ryuichi Shindou
Abstract: Phase transitions governed by topological defects constitute a cornerstone of modern physics. Two-dimensional (2D) Anderson transitions in chiral symmetry classes are driven by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs -- a mechanism analogous to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the 2D XY model. In this work, we extend this paradigm to three-dimensional (3D) chiral symmetry classes, where vortex loops emerge as the key topological defects governing the Anderson transition. By deriving the dual representation of the 3D nonlinear sigma model for the chiral unitary class, we develop a mean-field theory of its Anderson transition and elucidate the role of 1D weak band topology in the Anderson transition. Strikingly, our dual representation of the 3D NLSM in the chiral symmetry class uncovers its connection to the magnetostatics of 3D type-II superconductors. The metal-to-quasilocalized and quasilocalized-to-insulating transitions in 3D chiral symmetry class share a unified theoretical framework with the normal-to-mixed and mixed-to-superconducting transitions in 3D type-II superconductors under an external magnetic field, respectively.

Title: Microphase Separation Controls the Dynamics of Associative Vitrimers
Authors: Rahul Karmakar, Abhishek S. Chankapure, Srikanth Sastry, Sanat K. Kumar, Tarak K. Patra
Abstract: Vitrimers are a class of polymers characterized by dynamic covalent networks, where specific monomer units, which are know as stickers, form reversible crosslinks that enable network rearrangement without loss of overall connectivity. The conventional wisdom is that the sticker dynamics control chain relaxation behavior, and hence the mechanical properties of associative vitrimers where the number of crosslinked sticker pairs is precisely constant over time. Instead, here we show that the chemical differences between sticker groups and nonsticky chain monomers can cause them to microphase separate. Under these conditions, the slow exchange of a sticker from one microphase to an adjacent one controls relaxation behavior. Controlling sticker aggregation is thus a key to tailoring the properties of these polymers with immediate relevance to a circular polymer economy.

Title: Nonsymmorphic symmetry-enforced hourglass fermions and Rashba-Dresselhaus interaction in BiInO$_3$
Authors: Ramsamoj Kewat, Nirmal Ganguli
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the spin texture of the hourglass fermions band network in BiInO$_3$ using density functional theory (DFT) and symmetry analysis. Hourglass fermions are of interest in spintronics due to their unique and robust band structure, as well as their potential applications in novel electronic devices. BiInO$_3$ exhibits non-symmorphic crystal symmetries, such as glide reflection and glide rotational symmetry, influencing its electronic properties. Through symmetry analysis, we explore the band crossings and spin textures along specific high-symmetry paths in the Brillouin zone. Our results reveal a fascinating hourglass-shaped band dispersion and spin polarisation governed by symmetry operations and spin-orbit interaction. We analyse the spin-splitting mechanisms, including Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit interactions, and suggest potential applications for spin-based devices. This study sheds light on the role of symmetry in crystals for fascinating spin properties of hourglass fermions in non-symmorphic materials, offering insights for future developments in spintronics.

Title: Efficient Band Structure Unfolding with Atomic-centered Orbitals: General Theory and Application
Authors: Jingkai Quan, Nikita Rybin, Matthias Scheffler, Christian Carbogno
Abstract: Band structure unfolding is a key technique for analyzing and simplifying the electronic band structure of large, internally distorted supercells that break the primitive cell's translational symmetry. In this work, we present an efficient band unfolding method for atomic orbital (AO) basis sets that explicitly accounts for both the non-orthogonality of atomic orbitals and their atom-centered nature. Unlike existing approaches that typically rely on a plane-wave representation of the (semi-)valence states, we here derive analytical expressions that recasts the primitive cell translational operator and the associated Bloch-functions in the supercell AO basis. In turn, this enables the accurate and efficient unfolding of conduction, valence, and core states in all-electron codes, as demonstrated by our implementation in the all-electron ab initio simulation package FHI-aims, which employs numeric atom-centered orbitals. We explicitly demonstrate the capability of running large-scale unfolding calculations for systems with thousands of atoms and showcase the importance of this technique for computing temperature-dependent spectral functions in strongly anharmonic materials using CuI as example.

Title: Electronic and Thermoelectric Properties of Molecular Junctions Incorporating Organometallic Complexes: Implications for Thermoelectric Energy Conversion

Abstract: The electronic and thermoelectric properties of molecular junctions formed from iron and ruthenium metal-acetylide were studied using complementary experimental techniques and quantum chemical simulations. We performed physical characterizations of single-molecule and self-assembled monolayer junctions of the same molecules that allowed meaningful comparisons between the Ru and Fe adducts. In the case of the Fe-containing junctions, two distinct oxidation states are present. These junctions exhibit one of the highest Seebeck coefficients (S ca. 130 {\mu}V/K) reported to date for similar systems paired with broad electric conductance distribution and limited thermal conductance. As a result, the experimental thermoelectric figure of merit ZT for Fe-containing junctions reaches up to 0.4 for junctions with relatively high conductance. This is one of the highest ZT values reported for molecular systems at room temperature.

Title: Reevaluating the electrical impact of atomic carbon impurities in MoS2
Authors: James Ramsey, Faiza Alhamed, Jonathan P. Goss, Patrick R. Briddon, Mark J. Rayson
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides, a family of two-dimensional compounds, are of interest for a range of technological applications. MoS2, the most researched member of this family, is hexagonal, from which monolayers may be isolated. Under ambient conditions and during growth/processing, contamination by impurities can occur, of which carbon is significant due to its presence in the common growth techniques. We have performed extensive computational investigations of carbon point defects, examining substitutional and interstitial locations. Previously unreported thermodynamically stable configurations, four-fold co-ordinated mono-carbon and di-carbon substitutions of Mo, and a complex of carbon substitution of sulfur bound to interstitial sulfur have been identified. We find no evidence to support recent assertions that carbon defects are responsible for electrical doping of MoS2, finding all energetically favorable forms have only deep charge transition levels and would act as carrier traps. To aid unambiguous identification of carbon defects, we present electronic and vibrational data for comparison with spectroscopy.

Title: Rabi-induced localization and resonant delocalization of a binary condensate in a spin-asymmetric quasiperiodic potential
Authors: Swarup K. Sarkar, Sh. Mardonov, E. Ya. Sherman, Pankaj K. Mishra
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the ground state and dynamics of a Rabi-coupled pseudospin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate, where only one spin component is subjected to an external potential. We show that in the quasiperiodic potential the Rabi coupling induces localization between the components as it is raised above the threshold value. Interestingly, the localization is mutually induced by both components for the quasiperiodic confinement, whereas for a harmonic trap the localization is induced in the potential-free component by interaction with that confined in the potential. Further, we explore the condensate dynamics by implementing a periodic driving of the Rabi frequency, where various frequency-dependent delocalization patterns, such as double (triple)-minima, tree-(parquet)-like, and frozen distributions with a correlated propagation of different spin populations are observed in the condensate density. These features pave the way to control the condensate mass and spin density patterns, both in the stationary and dynamical realizations.

Title: Electrical Characterization of hexagonal SiGe
Authors: Isabelle Bollier, Federico Balduini, Marilyne Sousa, Marco Vettori, Wouter H.J. Peeters, Erik P.A.M. Bakkers, Heinz Schmid
Abstract: We report electrical measurements on hexagonal silicon-germanium (hex-SiGe), a group IV alloy with direct bandgap. Electrical contacts are formed by metal alloying and doping is achieved using ion implantation. The metastable hex-SiGe phase is successfully recovered after implantation by solid phase recrystallization. Independent of the metal used, contacts on n-type resulted in Schottky barriers due to Fermi level pinning of hex-SiGe. Overall, this constitutes a first step towards use of hex-SiGe for optoelectronic applications.

Title: Thermoelectric Fingerprinting of Bloch- and Néel-type Skyrmions
Authors: Christopher E. A. Barker, Elias Saugar, Katharina Zeissler, Robert Puttock, Petr Klapetek, Olga Kazakova, Christopher H. Marrows, Oksana Chubykalo-Fesenko, Craig Barton
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale spin textures that exhibit topological stability, which, along with novel thermal and electrical transport properties, make them the ideal candidates for a variety of novel technological applications. Accessing the skyrmion spin texture at the nanoscale and understanding its interaction with local thermal gradients is essential for engineering skyrmion-based transport phenomena. However, direct experimental insight into the local thermoelectric response of single skyrmions remains limited. To address this, we employ scanning thermoelectric microscopy~(SThEM) to probe the nanoscale thermoelectric response from a single skyrmion. By mapping the local thermoelectric voltage with nanoscale precision, we reveal a unique spatially resolved response that is the convolution of the underlying spin texture of the skyrmion and its interaction with the highly localised thermal gradient originating from the heated probe. We combine this with thermoelectric modelling of a range of skyrmion spin textures to reveal unique thermoelectric responses and allow the possibility of SThEM to be used as a tool to distinguish nanoscale spin textures. These findings provide fundamental insights into the interaction of topologically protected spin textures with local thermal gradients and the resultant spin transport. We demonstrate a novel route to characterise nanoscale spin textures, accelerating the material optimisation cycle, while also opening the possibility to harness skyrmions for spin caloritronics.

Title: AC-driven Spin Valves: Capacitive Behavior and Resonator Applications
Authors: Yunwen Liu, Jiang Xiao
Abstract: This study explores the time-dependent spin transport phenomena in magnetic heterostructures under alternating currents (AC), advancing the relatively underdeveloped field of alternating spintronics. Employing a time-dependent spin diffusion model, we show that the interplay of AC frequencies and spin relaxation times reveals significant differences in spin accumulation patterns compared to conventional direct current (DC) scenarios. Of particular interest is the emergence of capacitive-like impedance in a spin valve under AC conditions, which is especially pronounced in antiparallel spin configurations. These findings open up possibilities for developing high-frequency spintronic devices, including the proposed "spin resonator", which functions like a standard LC resonator but without a traditional capacitor.

Title: Spin Liquid Mimicry in the Hydroxide Double Perovskite CuSn(OH)$_6$ Induced by Correlated Proton Disorder

Wolter, Sergei A. Zvyagin, Yurii V. Skourski, Vladimir Yu. Pomjakushin, Inés Puente-Orench, Darren C. Peets, Thomas Doert, Dmytro S. Inosov
Abstract: The face-centered-cubic lattice is composed of edge-sharing tetrahedra, making it a leading candidate host for strongly frustrated magnetism, but relatively few face-centered frustrated materials have been investigated. In the hydroxide double perovskite \cusnoh, magnetic frustration of the Cu$^{2+}$ quantum spins is partially relieved by strong Jahn-Teller distortions. Nevertheless, the system shows no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 45\,mK and instead exhibits broad thermodynamic anomalies in specific heat and magnetization, indicating short-range dynamical spin correlations\, -- \,a behavior typical of quantum spin liquids. We propose that such an unusual robustness of the spin-liquid-like state is a combined effect of quantum fluctuations of the quantum spins $S=\frac{1}{2}$, residual frustration on the highly distorted face-centered Cu$^{2+}$ sublattice, and correlated proton disorder. Similar to the disorder-induced spin-liquid mimicry in YbMgGaO$_4$ and herbertsmithite, proton disorder destabilizes the long-range magnetic order by introducing randomness into the magnetic exchange interaction network. However, unlike the quenched substitutional disorder on the magnetic sublattice, which is difficult to control, proton disorder can in principle be tuned through pressure-driven proton ordering transitions. This opens up the prospect of tuning the degree of disorder in a magnetic system to better understand its influence on the magnetic ground state.

Title: Confined acoustic phonons in CsPbI3 nanocrystals explored by resonant Raman scattering on excitons

Abstract: Optical properties of the lead halide perovskites nanocrystals are controlled by confined excitons and rich spectrum of confined acoustic and optical phonons. We study experimentally and theoretically the exciton-phonon interaction in CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals embedded in a glass matrix. Energies of phonon modes allowed by selection rules are detected by resonant Raman scattering for nanocrystals with sizes of 4-13 nm, covering exciton energies of 1.72-2.25 eV. While optical phonon energies remain size-independent, the energies of confined acoustic phonons increase in smaller nanocrystals. Acoustic phonons are modeled within the continuum approximation using elastic constants computed by density functional theory. The model provides the energy spectra of confined phonons for nanocrystals of various shapes (cube, sphere, spheroid), crystal symmetries (orthorhombic and tetragonal), and sizes. Exciton confinement restricts efficient coupling to only few phonon modes observable in Raman spectra. By comparing experimental data with model predictions, we conclude that the nanocrystals in our samples predominantly have spherical or spheroidal shapes.

Title: Wurtzite Boron Nitride as a potential defects host
Authors: M. Silvetti, M. Pouyot, E. Cannuccia
Abstract: Wurtzite boron nitride (wBN) is a polymorph of boron nitride and serves as an intermediate phase in the transition from hBN to cBN under high pressure and temperature conditions. Owing to these extreme synthesis conditions, wBN likely inherits defects from hexagonal phase, where bright and stable single-photon emitters have been observed in both the visible and ultraviolet spectral ranges. While hBN and cubic BN (cBN) have been extensively studied for hosting quantum emitters, wBN remains comparatively unexplored. In this work, we use first-principles hybrid DFT calculations to investigate the formation energies and electronic structures of key native point defects in wBN, including boron and nitrogen vacancies, antisites, and carbon impurities, across various charge states. Our results reveal the potential of wBN as a robust platform for optically active defects. These properties make it a promising candidate for quantum technologies operating under extreme conditions. This study lays the groundwork for future experimental efforts in defect identification and engineering in wBN.

Title: An analysis of derivative absorption spectroscopy of multiferroic bismuth ferrite materials
Authors: Ramachandran Balakrishnan
Abstract: The probability density function (PDF) and cumulative density function (CDF) of bulk BiFeO3, nanostructured BiFeO$_3$, and thick film of BiFeO$_{2.85}$ were studied in detail based on their experimental absorption data. The goal of this study was to investigate the electronic transitions and the Urbach tail band in three samples of the magnetoelectric multiferroic BiFeO$_3$. The PDF and CDF functions were derived from the absorption data of these substances in the UV-visible-NIR region of light spectrum. For the BiFeO$_3$-based materials, charge transfer (p-d and/or p-p) transitions in the energy range of 2.5 eV to 5.5 eV were identified through PDF and CDF analysis. Furthermore, spin-orbit and electron-lattice interactions along with a low-symmetry crystal field cause two doubly degenerate d-d transitions of Fe$^{3+}$ ions in the FeO$_6$ octahedra of the BiFeO$_3$ samples to occur between 1.5 eV and 2.5 eV. Additionally, the BiFeO3-based materials exhibited strong direct and weak indirect transitions near the band edge, which point to a complex band structure of BiFeO$_3$. Finally, the energy of the defect-induced Urbach tail band was directly calculated by examining the CDF function of the materials, yielding estimated values of approximately 0.40 eV, 0.31 eV, and 0.33 eV for the bulk, nanostructured, and film BiFeO$_3$ samples, respectively.

Title: Diverse polymorphs and phase transitions in van der Waals In$_2$Se$_3$
Authors: Mingfeng Liu, Jiantao Wang, Peitao Liu, Qiang Wang, Zhibo Liu, Yan Sun, Xing-Qiu Chen
Abstract: Van der Waals In$_2$Se$_3$ has garnered significant attention due to its unique properties and wide applications associated with its rich polymorphs and polymorphic phase transitions. Despite extensive studies, the vast complex polymorphic phase space remains largely unexplored, and the underlying microscopic mechanism for their phase transformations remains elusive. Here, we develop a highly accurate, efficient, and reliable machine-learning potential (MLP), which not only facilitates accurate exploration of the intricate potential energy surface (PES), but also enables us to conduct large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with first-principles accuracy. We identify the accurate structure of the $\beta''$ polymorph and uncover several previously unreported $\beta'$ polymorph variants exhibiting dynamic stability and competing energies, which are elucidated by characteristic flat imaginary phonon bands and the distinctive Mexican-hat-like PES in the $\beta$ polymorph. Through the MLP-accelerated MD simulations, we directly observe the polymorphic phase transformations among the $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\beta'$, and $\beta''$ polymorphs under varying temperature and pressure conditions, and build for the first time an ab initio temperature-pressure phase diagram, showing good agreement with experiments. Furthermore, our MD simulations reveal a novel strain-induced reversible phase transition between the $\beta'$ and $\beta''$ polymorphs. This work not only unveils diverse polymorphs in van der Waals In$_2$Se$_3$, but also provides crucial atomic insights into their phase transitions, opening new avenues for the design of novel functional electronic devices.

Title: Crystallization of metallic glass as a grain-boundary nucleated process: experimental and theoretical evidence for the grain structure of metallic glasses
Authors: Nikolay V. Alekseechkin
Abstract: Experimental DSC and Avrami curves for the crystallization of metallic glasses demonstrate nucleation at grain boundaries and thus indicate their grain structure, which refutes the generally accepted idea of glass as a homogeneous frozen liquid obtained as a result of avoiding crystallization. Under certain conditions, this nucleation mechanism results in the appearance of two-peak DSC curves and three-step Avrami plots which are observed experimentally. To clarify these conditions, isothermal and non-isothermal surface-nucleated crystallization of a spherical particle is considered within the framework of a simple analytical model of nucleation and growth.

Title: Observing Laughlin's pump using quantized edge states in graphene
Authors: Bjarke S. Jessen, Maëlle Kapfer, YuhaoZhao, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Cory R. Dean, Oded Zilberberg
Abstract: Laughlin's thought experiment of quantized charge pumping is central to understanding the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) and the topological origin of its conductance quantization. Its direct experimental observation, however, has been hindered by the difficulty of realizing clean electronic edges. We address this by fabricating ultra-small, lithographically defined contacts on graphene. This creates a Corbino-equivalent system, with well-confined inner edge states. Crucially, the small contact size induces strong energy quantization of the edge states. This quantization allows us to directly resolve the spectral flow associated with Laughlin's pump. By tracing the finite-size resonances of the inner edge, we observe clear oscillations in conductance as a function of magnetic field and carrier density. The oscillation period scales with contact size, consistent with quantized charge transfer. Thus, our results provide a direct observation of the spectral flow underlying Laughlin's pump. The simplicity of the graphene platform makes this approach scalable and robust for exploring fundamental topological effects.

Title: Anomalous refractive index modulation and giant birefringence in 2D ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$
Authors: Houssam El Mrabet Haje, Roald J. H. van der Kolk, Trent M. Kyrk, Mazhar N. Ali
Abstract: 2D ferroelectric (FE) materials have opened new opportunities in non-volatile memories, computation and non-linear optics due to their robust polarization in the ultra-thin limit and inherent flexibility in device integration. Recently, interest has grown in the use of 2D FEs in electro-optics, demanding the exploration of their electronic and optical properties. In this work, we report the discovery of an unprecedented anomalous thickness-dependent change in refractive index, as large as $\delta n$ $\sim$ 23.2$\%$, in the 2D ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$, far above the ultra-thin limit, and at room temperature. Additionally, we observe a giant birefringence in the blue-ultraviolet regime, with a maximum $\vert n_{OOP} - n_{IP}\vert$ $\sim$ 1.24 at $t \sim$ 22 nm and $\lambda$ = 339.5 nm. We relate changes in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ optical constants to changes in the Cu(I) FE polarization contribution, influenced by its ionic mobility, opening the door to electronic control of its optical response for use in photonics and electro-optics.

Title: Molecular motion at the experimental glass transition
Authors: Romain Simon, Jean-Louis Barrat, Ludovic Berthier
Abstract: We propose a novel strategy to study numerically the glass transition of molecular fluids. Our approach combines the construction of simple yet realistic models with the development of Monte Carlo algorithms to accelerate equilibration and sampling. Inspired by the well-studied ortho-terphenyl glass-former, we construct a molecular model with an analogous triangular geometry and construct a `flip' Monte Carlo algorithm. We demonstrate that the flip Monte Carlo algorithm achieves a sampling speedup of about $10^9$ at the experimental glass transition temperature $T_g$. This allows us to systematically analyze the equilibrium structure and molecular dynamics of the model over a temperature regime previously inaccessible. We carefully compare the observed physical behavior to earlier studies that used atomistic models. In particular, we find that the glass fragility and the departure from the Stokes-Einstein relation are much closer to experimental observations. We characterize the development and temperature evolution of spatial correlations in the relaxation dynamics, using both orientational and translational degrees of freedom. Excess wings emerge at intermediate frequencies in dynamic rotational spectra, and we directly visualize the corresponding molecular motion near $T_g$. Our approach can be generalized to a number of molecular geometries and paves the way to a complete understanding of how molecular details may affect more universal physical aspects characterizing molecular liquids approaching their glass transition.

Title: Quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a Mott insulator in a gas of ultracold atoms
Authors: Markus Greiner, Olaf Mandel, Tilman Esslinger, Theodor W Hänsch, Immanuel Bloch
Abstract: For a system at a temperature of absolute zero, all thermal fluctuations are frozen out, while quantum fluctuations prevail. These microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a many-body system when the relative strength of two competing energy terms is varied across a critical value. Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.

Title: Kondo-Peierls transition with nonsymmorphic zone boundary gap formation
Authors: Kazumasa Hattori, Hiroaki Kusunose
Abstract: We study nonsymmorphic space group symmetry breakings in correlated electron systems. Under nonsymmorphic symmetry, it is well known that there are degeneracies in the electronic Bloch states at the Brillouin zone boundaries. When the system undergoes a phase transition into an ordered phase with breaking the nonsymmorphic symmetry, the degeneracy is lifted. This happens even when the order parameter is uniform. We point out that this general feature leads to various {\it uniform} Peierls transition in nonsymmorphic systems. In particular, we show that such mechanism of the Peierls gap formation can be realized accompanying with uniform anisotropic Kondo singlet formations. This explains the hidden electric order observed in CeCoSi.

Title: Characterization of Morphology Evolution in a Polymer-Clay Nanocomposite using Multiscale Simulations
Authors: Parvez Khana, Ankit Patidara, Gaurav Goel
Abstract: Molecular simulations provide an effective route for investigating morphology evolution and structure-property relationship in polymer-clay nanocomposites (PCNCs) incorporating layered silicates like montmorillonite (MMT), an important class of materials that show a significant enhancement over the constituent polymer for several properties. However, long relaxation times and large system size requirements limit the application to systems of practical interest. In this work, we have developed a coarse-grained (CG) model of organically modified MMT (oMMT) compatible with the MARTINI force field, a chemically-specific interaction model with high transferability. The dispersive and polar components of cleavage energy, basal spacing, and mechanical properties of MMT with tetramethylammonium (TMA) as intergallery ions were used to obtain a rational estimate for clay particle MARTINI bead types in accordance with the polarity of the functional group. The CG model provided accurate concurrent estimates for the structural, thermodynamic, and dynamical properties of PE in a PE/TMA-MMT PCNC, with less than 4% deviation from all atom (AA) simulations. The slow clay-induced redistribution of the PE-b-PEG block copolymer in the PCNCs was investigated using the developed CG model, with conformational changes occurring over a microsecond timescale. The preferential interaction coefficient and cluster analysis of individual blocks of PE-b-PEG were used to study the effect of clay arrangement (exfoliated versus tactoid) on copolymer reorientation and assembly at the clay surface. We find that the oMMT coated with PE-b-PEG acts as a neutral surface (small difference in polymer-polymer and polymer-oMMT+PE-b-PEG enthalpic interactions) and the primary influence of the nanofiller is a result of confinement and steric effect of the clay sheets on the PE chains.

Title: Computational Design of Two-Dimensional MoSi$_2$N$_4$ Family Field-Effect Transistor for Future Ångström-Scale CMOS Technology Nodes
Authors: Che Chen Tho, Zongmeng Yang, Shibo Fang, Shiying Guo, Liemao Cao, Chit Siong Lau, Fei Liu, Shengli Zhang, Jing Lu, L. K. Ang, Lain-Jong Li, Yee Sin Ang
Abstract: Advancing complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology into the sub-1-nm angström-scale technology nodes is expected to involve alternative semiconductor channel materials, as silicon transistors encounter severe performance degradation at physical gate lengths below 10 nm. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have emerged as strong candidates for overcoming short-channel effects due to their atomically thin bodies, which inherently suppress electrostatic leakage and improve gate control in aggressively scaled field-effect transistors (FETs). Among the growing library of 2D materials, the MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family -- a synthetic septuple-layered materials -- has attracted increasing attention for its remarkable ambient stability, suitable bandgaps, and favorable carrier transport characteristics, making it a promising platform for next-generation transistors. While experimental realization of sub-10-nm 2D FETs remains technologically demanding, computational device simulation using first-principles density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green's function transport simulations provide a powerful and cost-effective route for exploring the performance limits and optimal design of ultrascaled FET. This review consolidates the current progress in the computational design of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FETs. We review the physical properties of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ that makes them compelling candidates for transistor applications, as well as the simulated device performance and optimization strategy of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FETs. Finally, we identify key challenges and research gaps, and outline future directions that could accelerate the practical deployment of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FET in the angström-scale CMOS era.

Title: Few-body bound states of bosonic mixtures in two-dimensional optical lattices
Authors: Matias Volante-Abovich, Felipe Isaule, Luis Morales-Molina
Abstract: We study the formation of bound states in a binary mixture of a few bosons in square optical lattices. Using the exact diagonalization method, we find that bound clusters of all available bosons can form. We provide a comprehensive numerical examination of these bound states for a wide range of repulsive intraspecies and attractive interspecies interactions. In contrast to binary mixtures in one-dimensional chains, we reveal that the binding energy of the clusters shows a non-monotonic dependence on the interspecies interaction strengths for small tunneling rates, developing a local minimum for intermediate attractive interactions. The findings of this work highlight the difference between the binding mechanisms of binary bosonic mixtures in one- and higher-dimensional lattices.

Title: Visualization and manipulation of four-leaf clover-shaped electronic state in cuprate
Authors: Zechao Wang, Fengyu Yao, Yuchen Huo, Zhongxu Wei, Zhiyuan Song, Mingqiang Ren, Ziyuan Cheng, Jinfeng Jia, Yu-Jie Sun, Qi-Kun Xue
Abstract: High-Tc superconductivity in cuprates arises from carrier doping of an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator. Associated with these changes are spectral-weight transfers from the high-energy to low-energy, giving rise to a variety of intriguing electronic phenomena. In this study, for the first time, we discovered a 2a0 sized four-leaf clover-shaped (FLC) electronic state at low-energy, accompanied with the emergence of a characteristic "kink" around 16meV. With increasing doping, the number of FLC pattern decreases and ultimately vanishes in the overdoped region. Remarkably, we achieved real-time electric-field manipulation of this FLC state, through innovative in-situ scanning tunneling microscopy probe. This novel FLC state may not only redefine our understanding of precursor states of pairing, but also reveals its crucial role as a tunable electronic phase in high-Tc superconductors.

Title: Analytical Calculation of Viscosity in Rouse Networks Below Gelation Transition
Authors: Bohan Lyu, Jie Lin
Abstract: This work establishes an exact relationship between the zero-shear viscosity and the radius of gyration for generalized Rouse model with arbitrary network configurations. Building on this fundamental relationship, we develop a random graph approach to derive analytical expressions for network viscosity in mean-field connected systems through coarse-grained graph viscosity relations. The theory fully characterizes the subcritical regime, determining precise asymptotic behavior in both dilute and pre-gelation limits.

Title: Ultrafast photocurrent detection reveals that device efficiency is dominated by ultrafast exciton dissociation not exciton diffusion
Authors: Zachary M. Faitz, Chris J. Blackwell, Dasol Im, Abitha Dhavamani, Michael Arnold, Martin T. Zanni
Abstract: Excitons diffusing to a charge-separating interface is a necessary step to convert energy into current in next-generation photovoltaics. In this report, made possible by a new ultrafast spectrometer design, we compare exciton dynamics measured using both photoabsorption- and photocurrent-detected transient and 2D spectroscopies. For a device with semiconducting carbon nanotubes as the exciton transport material, we find that photoabsorption detection greatly overestimates the importance of long-lived excitons for device performance. Excitons diffuse and transfer between nanotubes for several picoseconds, but the large majority of photocurrent is created within 30fs by excitons that diffuse little to the C60 electron transfer material. These results change our understanding of the material features most important for these photovoltaics. Photoabsorption detection measures all excitons, but not all photogenerated excitons generate current. To understand device efficiency, this study points to the necessity for directly measuring the exciton dynamics responsible for photocurrent.

Title: Observation of Cavity-Mediated Nonlinear Landau Fan and Modified Landau Level Degeneracy in Graphene Quantum Transport
Authors: Hongxia Xue, Hsun-Chi Chan, Zuzhang Lin, Dalin Boriçi, Shaobo Zhou, Yanan Wang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Cristiano Ciuti, Wang Yao, Dong-Keun Ki, Shuang Zhang
Abstract: Recent studies on cavity-coupled two-dimensional electron gas demonstrate that vacuum-field engineering can tailor electronic transport properties of materials. By achieving ultra-strong coupling between a terahertz resonator and mesoscopic graphene, we demonstrate that cavity vacuum fields can alter the effective degeneracies of Landau levels, resulting in a nonlinear Landau fan diagram for massless Dirac fermions while preserving quantum-Hall quantization. Specifically, by leveraging graphene's gate-tunability, we observe that quantum-Hall features, minimum longitudinal and quantized Hall conductance for a given filling factor, occur at carrier densities reduced by more than 20 percent compared to systems without cavity. Theoretical analysis attributes this effect to the virtual cavity photon mediated transitions between the non-equidistant Landau levels in graphene, significantly reducing their effective degeneracy. This study paves the way for investigating cavity quantum electrodynamics in highly tunable, atomically thin two-dimensional crystals.

Title: Nonideal Statistical Field Theory at NLO
Authors: P.R.S. Carvalho
Abstract: In this work we introduce a field theory capable of describing the critical properties of nonideal systems undergoing continuous phase transitions beyond the leading order radiative corrections or in the number of loops (effective field theories limited only to leading order were recently defined in literature). These systems present defects, inhomogeneities and impurities as opposed to ideal ones which are perfect, homogeneous and pure. We compute the values of the critical exponents of the theory beyond leading order and compare with their corresponding experimental measured results. The results show some interplay between nonideal effects and fluctuations.

Title: Imaginary Time Formalism for Causal Nonlinear Response Functions
Authors: Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn
Abstract: It is well established that causal linear response functions can be found by computing the much simpler imaginary time-ordered Matsubara functions and performing an analytic continuation. This principle is the basis for much of our understanding of linear response for interacting and disordered systems, via diagrammatic perturbation theory. Similar imaginary-time approaches have recently been introduced for computing nonlinear response functions as well, although the rigorous connection between Matsubara and causal nonlinear response functions has not been clearly elucidated. In this work, we provide a proof of this connection to all orders in perturbation theory. Using an equations of motion approach, we show by induction that casual nonlinear response functions at every order can be obtained from an analytic continuation of an appropriate time-ordered Matsubara function. We demonstrate this connection explicitly for second order response functions in the Lehmann representation. As a byproduct of our approach, we derive an explicit expression for the Lehmann representation of $n$-th order response functions by solving the equations of motion. We also use our result to find an analytic spectral density representation for both causal response functions and Matsubara functions. Finally, we show how our results lead to a family of generalized sum rules, focusing explicitly on the asymptotic expression for $n$-th harmonic generation rate.

Title: Spin-orbit interaction, band topology, and spin texture in BiInO3(001) surface
Authors: Ramsamoj Kewat, Nirmal Ganguli
Abstract: This research investigates the implication of spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and symmetry on the band topology and spin texture at the (001) surface of BiInO$_3$. Using density functional theory (DFT) and symmetry analysis, the study explores the impact of surface termination on the electronic structure, particularly focusing on how the loss of translational symmetry at the surface influences the band topology of the surface states. Key findings include discovering two dangling surface states (named SS1 and SS2) with distinct spin textures. SS1 exhibits Rashba spin splitting due to surface inversion asymmetry, characterised by isotropic effective mass and tangential spin alignment on constant energy contours. In contrast, SS2 features a persistent spin Texture (PST) spin texture, a momentum-independent spin polarisation. The orbital contributions to these bands, dominated by specific s and p orbitals, dictate the direction and nature of the spin texture. This study highlights BIO's potential as a platform for spintronic applications, where control over spin textures and electronic properties at the surface can enable the design of advanced spin-based devices. The findings bridge the gap between symmetry-driven theoretical frameworks and practical material functionalities, offering insights into the interplay of surface symmetry, SOI, and band topology.

Title: Photocurrents induced by k-linear terms in semiconductors and semimetals
Authors: M.M. Glazov, E.L. Ivchenko
Abstract: We develop a six-band $\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{p}$ model to describe the electronic structure and optical response of chiral multifold semimetals, such as RhSi. By means of invariants method we construct the effective Hamiltonian describing the states near the $\Gamma$-point of the Brillouin zone where the spin-orbit coupling and $\mathbf{k}$-linear Rashba terms, which are crucial for circular photogalvanic effect, are taken into account. The model is parameterized using tight-binding calculations. We compute the interband absorption spectrum, showing a linear-in-frequency dependence at low energies and a resonant feature near the spin-orbit splitting energy. Furthermore, we calculate the circular photogalvanic effect. In agreement with previous works the current generation rate at low frequencies exhibits a quantized low-frequency response, governed by the universal value $|\mathcal{C}| = 4$ for the effective topological charge. Our results provide an analytical framework for understanding the role of Rashba coupling and topology in the optoelectronic properties of multifold chiral semimetals.

Title: Anisotropy-Induced Magnetic Field Generation in Bidimensional Materials
Authors: Diogo Simões, Hugo Terças, Jorge Ferreira
Abstract: We investigate an electromagnetic instability in two-dimensional materials arising from an anisotropy of the Fermi surface, utilizing a kinetic model accounting for the effects of the values of temperature, chemical potential and anisotropy ratio, as well as considering both linear and quadratic low-energy band structures. The wavenumber-dependent growth-rate of these modes is derived in the linear regime, and their confinement, contrasting with stable electromagnetic waves in these systems, is described. The generation of structured out-of-plane magnetic fields, as well as their behaviour in saturation, is shown using fully kinetic and non-linear simulations.

Abstract: Time-resolved ultrafast extreme ultraviolet (EUV) magnetic scattering is used to study laser-driven ultrafast magnetization dynamics of labyrinthine domains in a [Co/Ni/Pt] multilayer. Our measurements at the Co and Ni M-edges reveal distinct ultrafast distortions of the scattering pattern position and width for Ni compared to Co. Ni shows a strong modification of the scattering pattern, 9 to 41 times stronger than Co. As distortions of the labyrinthine pattern in reciprocal space relate to the modification of domain textures in real space, significant differences in Co and Ni highlight a 3D distortion of the domain pattern in the far-from-equilibrium regime.

Title: Synergy of Rashba and Topological Effects for High-Performance Bismuth-Based Thermoelectrics
Authors: Lei Peng, Ruixiao Lian, Hongyu Chen, Ben Li, Yu Wu, Yuxiang Zheng, Hao Zhang
Abstract: Band convergence is a key strategy for enhancing thermoelectric (TE) performance. Herein, we demonstrate a promising approach to enhance band convergence through inducing Rashba splitting in topological insulators. Theoretically designed Janus $\beta$-Bi$_2$Se$_2$Te and $\beta$-Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se exhibited inherent topological band inversion and Rashba splitting due to the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) with broken inversion symmetry. These characteristics synergistically improve band convergence, leading to a substantially enhanced power factor. Meanwhile, the Janus structural asymmetry suppresses lattice thermal conductivity. Consequently, Janus structures achieve boosted TE performance, especially for $\beta$-Bi$_2$Se$_2$Te, peaking figure of merit ($zT$) of 2.82. This work establishes a new framework for designing Janus topological compounds with high TE performance by the synergistic effect of Rashba splitting and band inversion.

Title: Optimal superconductivity near a Lifshitz transition in strained (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Siheon Ryee, Niklas Witt, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Tim O. Wehling
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity in pressurized and strained bilayer nickelates (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new frontier. One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a hole $\gamma$ pocket, or not. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $\gamma$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming fluctuations for the leading $s_\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $\gamma$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge provided the maximum energy level of the $\gamma$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.

Title: Frustrated edge currents in bilayers formed of s- and d-wave superconductors
Authors: Vedangi Pathak, Oguzhan Can, Nirek Brahmbhatt, Marcel Franz
Abstract: We explore edge currents in heterostructures formed of a high-$T_c$ cuprate and a conventional $s$-wave superconductors. The resulting $d\pm is$ superconductor spontaneously breaks time reversal symmetry and, remarkably, exhibits large edge currents along certain edge directions in spite of being topologically trivial. In addition we find that the edge currents are frustrated such that they appear to emerge from or flow into sample corners, seemingly violating charge conservation. Careful self-consistent solutions that guarantee charge conservation are required to understand how this frustration is resolved in physical systems. Calculations within the Ginzburg-Landau theory framework and fully self-consistent microscopic lattice models reveal intriguing patterns of current reversals depending on edge orientation, accompanied by spontaneous formation of magnetic flux patterns which can be used to detect these phenomena experimentally. Our study illuminates the interplay between time-reversal symmetry breaking and unconventional superconductivity in high-$T_c$ superconducting heterostructures, and shows that sizable edge currents are possible even in the absence of non-trivial bulk topology.

Title: New plasmon-like mode in PdTe$_{2}$: Raman scattering and memory function study
Authors: Bharathiganesh Devanarayanan, Sahil Rathi, Jalaja Pandya, Sonika, C.S.Yadav, Navinder Singh, Satyendra Nath Gupta
Abstract: PdTe$_2$ is a type II Dirac semimetal that has garnered significant attention due to its intriguing electronic and topological properties. Here, we report temperature dependent Raman scattering study of PdTe$_2$ in the temperature range from 10 K to 300 K. Our study reveals emergence of a new unreported peak below 100 K, centered around 250 cm$^{-1}$. We argue that the new mode is not a phonon mode because the Raman spectra calculated using Density Functional Theory shows only two intense peaks at 85 $ cm^{-1}$ and 128 $cm^{-1}$. To ascertain the origin of this new peak, we constructed a microscopic model of electrons coupling to a single plasmon mode at 250 $cm^{-1}$ and using the memory function formalism, we obtained that the Raman relaxation rate is linear in frequency. We also performed phenomenological analysis of the Raman response from the experimental data and computed frequency dependent Raman relaxation rate, which is also found to exhibit a linear dependence on frequency. With the congruence of our theoretical and phenomenological results we could ascertain that the new mode observed at low temperatures is indeed a plasmon-like mode. Further, phonon frequencies and line widths of the two phonon modes exhibit anomalous behavior above 100 K.

Title: Revealing electron-lattice decoupling by Peltier thermometry and nanoscale thermal imaging in graphene
Authors: Saurabh Kumar Srivastav, Tobias Völkl, Gary Quaresima, Yuri Myasoedov, Martin E. Huber, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, L. S. Levitov, D. A. Pesin, Eli Zeldov
Abstract: Electrical currents in low-dimensional quantum materials can drive electrons far from equilibrium, creating stark imbalance between electron and lattice temperatures. Yet, no existing methods enable simultaneous nanoscale mapping of both temperatures at cryogenic conditions. Here, we introduce a scanning probe technique that images the local lattice temperature and extracts electron temperature at gate-defined p-n junctions in graphene. By applying an alternating electrical current and analyzing first- and second-harmonic responses, we disentangle Joule heating from the Peltier effect-the latter encoding the local electron temperature. This enables the first spatially resolved cryogenic imaging of both phenomena in graphene. Even under modest current bias, the electron temperature increases by nearly three orders of magnitude more than the lattice temperature, revealing strong electron-phonon decoupling and indicating a previously unrecognized electron cooling pathway. Our minimally invasive method is broadly applicable to van der Waals heterostructures and opens new avenues for probing energy dissipation and non-equilibrium transport in correlated and hydrodynamic electron systems.

Title: Landau levels of a Dirac electron in graphene from non-uniform magnetic fields
Authors: Aritra Ghosh
Abstract: The occurrence of Landau levels in quantum mechanics is well known when a charged particle is subjected to a uniform magnetic field. Considering the recent interest in the electronic properties of graphene which admits a dispersion relation which is linear in the momentum near the Dirac points, we revisit the problem of Landau levels in the spirit of the Dirac Hamiltonian and ask if there are certain non-uniform magnetic fields which also lead to a spectrum consisting of the Landau levels. The answer, as we show, is in the affirmative. In particular, by considering isospectral deformations of the uniform magnetic field, we present explicit expressions for non-uniform magnetic fields that are strictly isospectral to their uniform counterpart, thus supporting the Landau levels.

Title: Rashba spin-orbit coupling and artificially engineered topological superconductors
Authors: Sankar Das Sarma, Katharina Laubscher, Haining Pan, Jay D. Sau, Tudor D. Stanescu
Abstract: One of the most important physical effects in condensed matter physics is the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), introduced in seminal works by Emmanuel Rashba. In this article, we discuss, describe, and review (providing critical perspectives on) the crucial role of RSOC in the currently active research area of topological quantum computation. Most, if not all, of the current experimental topological quantum computing platforms use the idea of Majorana zero modes as the qubit ingredient because of their non-Abelian anyonic property of having an intrinsic quantum degeneracy, which enables nonlocal encoding protected by a topological energy gap. It turns out that RSOC is a crucial ingredient in producing a low-dimensional topological superconductor in the laboratory, and such topological superconductors naturally have isolated localized midgap Majorana zero modes. In addition, increasing the RSOC strength enhances the topological gap, thus enhancing the topological immunity of the qubits to decoherence. Thus, Rashba's classic work on SOC may lead not only to the realization of localized non-Abelian anyons, but also fault tolerant quantum computation.

Title: Continuous symmetry breaking in 1D spin chains and 1+1D field theory
Authors: Adam Nahum
Abstract: We argue that ground states of 1D spin chains can spontaneously break U(1) ``easy-plane'' spin rotation symmetry, via true long-range order of $(S^x, S^y)$, at the phase transition between two quasi-long-range-ordered phases. The critical point can be reached by tuning a single parameter in a Hamiltonian with the same symmetry as the XXZ model, without further fine-tuning. Equivalently, it can arise in systems of bosons with particle-hole symmetry, as a long-range-ordered transition point between two quasi-long-range-ordered superfluids. Our approach is to start with the continuum field theory of the isotropic Heisenberg ferromagnet and consider generic perturbations that respect easy-plane symmetry. We argue for a renormalization-group flow to a critical point where long-range order in $(S^x, S^y)$ is enabled by coexisting critical fluctuations of $S^z$. (We also discuss multicritical points where further parameters are tuned to zero.) These results show that it is much easier to break continuous symmetries in 1D than standard lore would suggest. The failure of standard intuition for 1D chains (based on the quantum--classical correspondence) can be attributed to Berry phases, which prevent the 1+1D system from mapping to a classical 2D spin model. The present theory also gives an example of an ordered state whose Goldstone mode is interacting even in the infra-red, rather than becoming a free field.

Title: Dark Matter Haloscope with a Disordered Dielectric Absorber
Authors: Stewart Koppell, Otavio D. A. R. Bittencourt, Dip Joti Paul, Junwu Huang, Masha Baryakhtar, Karl K. Berggren
Abstract: Light dark matter candidates such as axions and dark photons generically couple to electromagnetism, yielding dark-matter-to-photon conversion as a key search strategy. In addition to resonant conversion in cavities and circuits, light dark matter bosons efficiently convert to photons on material interfaces, with a broadband power proportional to the total area of these interfaces. In this work, we make use of interface conversion to develop a new experimental dark matter detector design: the disordered dielectric detector. We show that a volume filled with dielectric powder is an efficient, robust, and broadband target for axion-to-photon or dark-photon-to-photon conversion. We perform semi-analytical and numerical studies in small-volume 2D and 3D disordered systems to compute the conversion power as a function of dark matter mass. We also discuss the power gathered onto a sensitive photodetector in terms of the bulk properties of the disordered material, making it possible to characterize the predicted dark-matter-to-photon conversion rate across a wide range of wavelengths. Finally, we propose DPHaSE: the Dielectric Powder Haloscope SNSPD Experiment which is composed of a disordered dielectric target, a veto system, and a photon collection chamber to maximize the coupling between the powder target and a low noise superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD). The projected reach, in the 10 meV-eV mass range, is sensitive to QCD axion-photon couplings and exceeds current constraints on dark photon dark matter by up to 5 orders of magnitude.

Title: Photocatalytic Control of Diamond Color Center Charge States via Surface Oxidation
Authors: Minghao Li, Josh A. Zuber, Marina Obramenko, Patrik Tognina, Andrea Corazza, Marietta Batzer, Marcel.li Grimau Puigibert, Jodok Happacher, Patrick Maletinsky
Abstract: Color center spins in diamond nanostructures are a key resource for emerging quantum technologies. Their innate surface proximity makes precise control of diamond surface chemistry essential for optimizing their functionality and charge states. However, conventional surface functionalization methods typically lack the tunability and efficiency required for robust charge-state control. Here, we introduce a deterministic, nonvolatile technique for continuously and efficiently tuning diamond's surface termination via laser-induced oxidation of H-terminated diamond nanopillars. By tracking SiV$^-$ photoluminescence as a charge-state proxy, we uncover the microscopic mechanism of this photocatalytic process through a systematic photon-flux and -energy analysis, where we identify charge-cycling of native defects as sources of optically generated holes driving the desired surface oxidation. Our results suggest that our method applies broadly to other color centers and host materials, offering a versatile tool for on-demand charge-state control and surface engineering in solid-state quantum devices.

Title: Hybrid thermalization in the large $N$ limit
Authors: Toshali Mitra, Sukrut Mondkar, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Alexander Soloviev
Abstract: Semi-holography provides a formulation of dynamics in gauge theories involving both weakly self-interacting (perturbative) and strongly self-interacting (non-perturbative) degrees of freedom. These two subsectors interact via their effective metrics and sources, while the full local energy-momentum tensor is conserved in the physical background metric. In the large $N$ limit, the subsectors have their individual entropy currents, and so the full system can reach a pseudo-equilibrium state in which each subsector has a different physical temperature. We first complete the proof that the global thermal equilibrium state, where both subsectors have the \textit{same} physical temperature, can be defined in consistency with the principles of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Particularly, we show that the global equilibrium state is the unique state with maximum entropy in the microcanonical ensemble. Furthermore, we show that in the large $N$ limit, a \textit{typical} non-equilibrium state of the full isolated system relaxes to the global equilibrium state when the average energy density is large compared to the scale set by the inter-system coupling. We discuss quantum statistical perspectives.

Title: Distributed Lyapunov Functions for Nonlinear Networks
Authors: Yiming Wang, Arthur N. Montanari, Adilson E. Motter
Abstract: Nonlinear networks are often multistable, exhibiting coexisting stable states with competing regions of attraction (ROAs). As a result, ROAs can have complex "tentacle-like" morphologies that are challenging to characterize analytically or computationally. In addition, the high dimensionality of the state space prohibits the automated construction of Lyapunov functions using state-of-the-art optimization methods, such as sum-of-squares (SOS) programming. In this letter, we propose a distributed approach for the construction of Lyapunov functions based solely on local information. To this end, we establish an augmented comparison lemma that characterizes the existence conditions of partial Lyapunov functions, while also accounting for residual effects caused by the associated dimensionality reduction. These theoretical results allow us to formulate an SOS optimization that iteratively constructs such partial functions, whose aggregation forms a composite Lyapunov function. The resulting composite function provides accurate convex approximations of both the volumes and shapes of the ROAs. We validate our method on networks of van der Pol and Ising oscillators, demonstrating its effectiveness in characterizing high-dimensional systems with non-convex ROAs.

Title: Stern-Gerlach deflection of cryogenically cold polyatomic molecules in superfluid nanodroplets
Authors: Benjamin S. Kamerin, Thomas H. Villers, John W. Niman, Jiahao Liang, Angel I. Pena Dominguez, Vitaly V. Kresin
Abstract: Beam deflection is capable of providing valuable information about the magnetic moments of molecules and clusters as well as the relaxation dynamics of their spins. However, observations have been hampered by magnetic couplings to excited vibrational and rotational states of polyatomic systems, which are challenging to control, characterize, and systematize. In this work, we carried out deflection measurements on superfluid helium nanodroplets doped with high-spin FeCl2 and CoCl2 molecules and their complexes. This enabled quantitative determination of the magnetic moments of molecules and clusters at extremely low, and fully defined, temperature of all of their degrees of freedom. The spin magnetic moments become thermalized and oriented along the applied field. Dimers and trimers are found to be antiferromagnetically ordered. The issue of rates and mechanisms of molecular spin relaxation within the cryogenic helium matrix is highlighted.

Title: Collective excitations in Hydrogen across the pressure-induced transition from molecular to atomic fluid
Authors: I.-M. Ilenkov, T. Bryk
Abstract: Dispersion of collective excitations in fluid Hydrogen along the isothermal line T=2500~K, including the region of molecular-to-atomis fluid transition, is studied by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The obtained density dependence of the adiabatic and high-frequency speed of sound contains a plateau in the region of the molecular-to-atomic fluid transition. We show, that the five-variable thermo-viscoelastic model of generalized hydrodynamics for pure molecular H$_2$ and pure atomic (H) fluids is able to recover perfectly the AIMD-derived time correlation functions and sound eigenvalues nicely agree with the numerically estimated sound dispersion. In the region of the molecular-to-atomic fluid transition a dynamic model of chemical reacting mixture should be applied. We discuss the calculations of time correlation functions from molecular/atomic units in the reacting mixture from AIMD trajectories.

Title: Variational simulation of quantum phase transitions induced by boundary fields
Authors: Alan C. Duriez, Andreia Saguia, Marcelo S. Sarandy
Abstract: The characterization of quantum phase transitions is a fundamental task for the understanding of quantum phases of matter, with a number of potential applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we use digital quantum simulation as a resource to theoretically and experimentally study quantum phase transitions. More specifically, we implement the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ transverse-field Ising chain in the presence of boundary magnetic fields. Such fields can induce a rich phase diagram, including a first-order line and also a continuous wetting transition, which is a quantum version of the classical wetting surface phenomenon. We present results for noiseless simulations of the associated quantum circuits as well as hardware results taken from a superconducting quantum processor. For different regions of the phase diagram, the quantum algorithm allows us to predict the critical value of the magnetic fields responsible for either the first or second-order transitions occuring in the system.

Title: All-Dielectric Metasurface with a Two-Dimensional Locally Flat Photonic Band
Authors: Minho Choi, Christopher Munley, Arnab Manna, Johannes Fröch, Arthur Barnard, Arka Majumdar
Abstract: Photonic flatbands offer promising light-matter interaction due to their unique slow-light nature. In recent years, flatbands have also attracted significant interest in optical engineering because of their angle-insensitive resonant characteristics. However, most photonic flatbands demonstrated to date occur only in one dimension and for a specific polarization, limiting their applicability. To date, no studies have reported the dispersionless behavior of flatbands under arbitrary two-dimensional incident angles. Here, we present a two-dimensional photonic flatband created using a silicon metasurface with a Lieb lattice structure which demonstrates a locally flat photonic band for both TE- and TM- polarized light. Employing Fourier imaging, we analyze its energy-momentum dispersion under arbitrary two-dimensional incident angles, demonstrating dispersionless flatbands up to +/-60° or +/-10°, depending on the polarization state and incident angle. This geometry is adaptable for applications in local field enhancement, enhanced photodetection, and augmented reality.

Title: Mirror-mediated long-range coupling and robust phase locking of spatially separated exciton-polariton condensates
Authors: Shuang Liang, Hassan Alnatah, Qi Yao, Jonathan Beaumariage, Ken West, Kirk Baldwin, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Natalia G. Berloff, David W. Snoke
Abstract: Lattice arrays have been shown to have great value as simulators for complicated mathematical problems. In all physical lattices so far, coupling is only between nearest neighbors or nearest plus next-nearest neighbors; the geometry of the lattice controls the couplings of the sites. Realizing independently tunable, long-range interactions between distant condensates is a prerequisite for scalable analogue spin machines but has so far been restricted to short-range geometric coupling. In this work we show that it is possible using two-dimensional lattices of polariton condensates to use the third dimension to arbitrarily select two sites to couple coherently. Light emitted in the vertical direction from a condensate at one site can be imaged and sent back into the system to impinge on a different condensate at an arbitrary distance. We demonstrate this for the case of two condensates, in which we first ensure that they have no coupling within the plane of the lattice, and then use external imaging to phase lock the two together. Phase-resolved interferometry confirms clearly visible interference fringes and deterministic phase locking even when direct, planar coupling is suppressed. Analytical modeling reveals complementary mechanisms underpinning the robust coherence. Because the mirror adds no cameras, modulators, or electronic processing, the condensate pair operates as a pure, high-bandwidth analog element. Extension to dense graphs via segmented micro-mirror arrays is therefore ultimately limited only by the field of view and numerical aperture of the imaging optics. Our scheme thus paves the way to reconfigurable, energy-efficient polaritonic hardware for optimization, classification, clustering, and other neuromorphic tasks at the speed of light.

Title: Static Contact Angles of Mixtures: Classical Density Functional Theory and Experimental Investigation
Authors: Benjamin Bursik, Nikolaos Karadimitriou, Holger Steeb, Joachim Gross
Abstract: This work assesses a classical density functional theory (DFT) model for predicting macroscopic static contact angles of pure substances and mixtures by comparison to own experimental data. We employ a DFT with a Helmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) for the fluid-fluid interactions and an effective external potential for the solid-fluid interactions. The solid substrate is characterized by adjusting a single solid-solid interaction energy parameter to a single contact angle value of $n$-octane, while all other results are predictions based on Berthelot-Lorentz combining rules. The surface tensions between solid, liquid and vapor phases are determined from one-dimensional DFT calculations, and Young's equation is used to calculate the contact angle. A non-polar polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon) substrate is used, and experiments are carried out using the sessile droplet method with graphical evaluation of the contact angle. Accurate results are obtained for pure substances except for monohydric alcohols. Contact angles for monohydric alcohols are systematically overestimated, and we show that this is partially due to neglecting orientational effects. The approach provides accurate results for mixtures whenever the respective pure substance contact angle is described well. This comprises mixtures of non-polar, polar, and hydrogen bonding substances, including mixtures with water. Our results suggest that DFT based on PC-SAFT provides a fast and accurate method for prediction of contact angles for a wide range of pure substances and mixtures.

Title: Kac-Rice inspired approach to non-Hermitian random matrices
Authors: Yan V Fyodorov
Abstract: We suggest a method of analyzing the joint probability density (JPD) ${\cal P}_N(z,{\bf v})$ of an eigenvalue $z$ and the associated right eigenvector ${\bf v}$ (normalized with ${\bf v}^*{\bf v}=1$) of non-Hermitian random matrices of a given size $N\times N$. The method, which represents an alternative to Girko Hermitization approach, is essentially based on the Kac-Rice counting formula applied to the associated characteristic polynomial combined with a certain integral identity for the Dirac delta function of such a polynomial. To illustrate utility of the general method we apply it to consider two particular cases: (i) one-parameter family of matrices interpolating between complex Ginibre and real Ginibre ensembles and (ii) a complex Ginibre matrix additively perturbed by a fixed matrix. In particular, in the former case we discuss the formation of an excess of eigenvalues in the vicinity of the real axis on approaching the real Ginibre limit, which eventually gives rise to the existence of a new scaling regime of "weak non-reality" as $N\to \infty$. In the second case we provide new insights into eigenvalue and eigenvector distribution for a general rank one perturbation of complex Ginibre matrices of finite size $N$, and in the structure of an outlier as $N\gg 1$. Finally we discuss a possible generalization of the proposed method which is expected to be suitable for analysis of JPD involving both left- and right eigenvectors.

Title: Characterizing Many-body Dynamics with Projected Ensembles on a Superconducting Quantum Processor
Authors: Zhiguang Yan, Zi-Yong Ge, Rui Li, Yu-Ran Zhang, Franco Nori, Yasunobu Nakamura
Abstract: Quantum simulators offer a new opportunity for the experimental exploration of non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics, which have traditionally been characterized through expectation values or entanglement measures, based on density matrices of the system. Recently, a more general framework for studying quantum many-body systems based on projected ensembles has been introduced, revealing novel quantum phenomena, such as deep thermalization in chaotic systems. Here, we experimentally investigate a chaotic quantum many-body system using projected ensembles on a superconducting processor with 16 qubits on a square lattice. Our results provide direct evidence of deep thermalization by observing a Haar-distributed projected ensemble for the steady states within a charge-conserved sector. Moreover, by introducing an ensemble-averaged entropy as a metric, we establish a benchmark for many-body information leakage from the system to its environment. Our work paves the way for studying quantum many-body dynamics using projected ensembles and shows a potential implication for advancing quantum simulation techniques.

Abstract: Gem-dicarbonyls of transition metals supported on metal (oxide) surfaces are common intermediates in heterogeneous catalysis. While infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a standard tool for detecting these species on applied catalysts, the ill-defined crystallographic environment of species observed on powder catalysts renders data interpretation challenging. In this work, we apply a multi-technique surface science approach to investigate rhodium gem-dicarbonyls on a single-crystalline rutile TiO$_2$(110) surface. We combine spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) to determine their location and coordination on the surface. IR spectroscopy shows the successful creation of gem-dicarbonyls on a titania single crystal by exposing deposited Rh atoms to CO gas, followed by annealing to 200-250 K. Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) data reveal that these complexes are mostly aligned along the [001] crystallographic direction, corroborating theoretical predictions. Notably, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data reveal multiple rhodium species on the surface, even when the IR spectra show only the signature of rhodium gem-dicarbonyls. As such, our results highlight the complex behavior of carbonyls on metal oxide surfaces, and demonstrate the necessity of multi-technique approaches for the adequate characterization of single-atom catalysts.

Title: Efficient implementation of quantum signal processing via the adiabatic-impulse model
Authors: D.O. Shendryk, O.V. Ivakhnenko, S.N. Shevchenko, Franco Nori
Abstract: Here we investigate analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.

Title: Anharmonic phonons via quantum thermal bath simulations
Authors: Taylor Baird, Rodolphe Vuilleumier, Sara Bonella
Abstract: Lattice vibrations within crystalline solids, or phonons, provide information on a variety of important material characteristics, from thermal qualities to optical properties and phase transition behaviour. When the material contains light ions, or is subjected to sufficiently low temperatures and/or high pressures, anharmonic and nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) may significantly alter its phonon characteristics. Unfortunately, accurate inclusion of these two effects within numerical simulations typically incurs a substantial computational cost. In this work, we present a novel approach which promises to mitigate this problem. The scheme leverages the recently introduced quantum correlators approach for the extraction of anharmonic phonon frequencies from molecular dynamics data. To account for NQEs without excessive increase of the computational cost, we include nuclear quantum effects via the quantum thermal bath (QTB) method. This is the first full exploration of the use of QTB for the calculation of phonon dispersion relations. We demonstrate the noteworthy efficiency and accuracy of the scheme, and analyze its upsides and drawbacks by first considering 1-dimensional systems, and then the physically interesting case of solid neon.

Title: Complexity of PXP scars revisited
Authors: Pawel Caputa, Xuhao Jiang, Sinong Liu
Abstract: We revisit a quantum quench scenario in which either a scarring or thermalizing initial state evolves under the PXP Hamiltonian. Within this framework, we study the time evolution of spread complexity and related quantities in the Krylov basis. We find that the Lanczos coefficients $b_n$, as functions of the iteration number $n$, exhibit a characteristic arched growth and decay, followed by erratic oscillations which we refer to as buttress. The arched profile predominantly arises from contributions within the quantum many-body scar subspace, while the buttress is linked to thermalization dynamics. To explain this behavior, we utilize the representation theory of $\mathfrak{s}l_3(\mathbb{C})$, allowing us to decompose the PXP Hamiltonian into a linear component and a residual part. The linear term governs the formation and width of the arch, and we observe that that there exists a threshold of arch width which determines whether a given initial state exhibits scarring. Meanwhile, the residual term accounts qualitatively for the emergence of the buttress. We estimate an upper bound for the extent of the buttress using Lucas numbers. Finally, we demonstrate that spread complexity oscillates periodically over time for scarred initial states, whereas such oscillations are suppressed in thermalizing cases.

Title: Quantum Walks: First Hitting Times with Weak Measurements
Authors: Tim Heine, Eli Barkai, Klaus Ziegler, Sabine Tornow
Abstract: We study the first detected recurrence time problem of continuous-time quantum walks on graphs. While previous works have employed projective measurements to determine the first return time, we implement a protocol based on weak measurements on a dilated system, enabling minimally invasive monitoring throughout the evolution. To achieve this, we extend the theoretical framework and complement it with both numerical simulations and experimental investigations on an IBM quantum computer. Despite the implementation of a generalized measurement, our modified formalism of weak recurrence provides a description purely within the Hilbert space of the quantum system. Our results reveal that the first hitting time scales inversely with the coupling parameter between the ancilla and the quantum system.

Title: Two-mode hyperradiant lasing in a system of two quantum dots embedded in a bimodal photonic crystal cavity
Authors: Lavakumar Addepalli, P.K. Pathak
Abstract: We propose a scheme for two-mode hyperradiant lasing in a system comprising two incoherently pumped quantum dots (QDs) coupled to a bimodal photonic crystal cavity. To account for the exciton-phonon interactions, we employ a time-convolutionless polaron-transformed master equation. Both resonant and off-resonant couplings of the QDs to the cavity modes are considered, and we analyze the resulting radiance witness as well as the intra- and inter-mode photon correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phonon-induced cooperative two-mode two-photon processes significantly enhance the radiance witness. This enhancement is quantified by evaluating the emission and absorption rates associated with both single-mode and two-mode two-photon transitions. Finally, we compare the radiance witness and emission spectral linewidths for QDs coupled to single-mode and bimodal cavities, revealing that an increase in radiance witness is accompanied by a narrowing of the emission linewidth.

Title: Resonating Kagome Dimer coverings in Rydberg atom arrays
Authors: Xicheng Wang, Erich J Mueller
Abstract: Motivated by experiments on Rydberg atom arrays, we explore the properties of uniform quantum superpositions of kagome dimer configurations and construct an efficient algorithm for experimentally producing them. We begin by considering the thin cylinder limit, where these states have simple descriptions. We then develop a matrix product representation of the states on arbitrary cylinders, which leads to a natural protocol to efficiently grow them. We explain how our approach can be adapted to other quantum computing hardware.

Title: Ambiguities, Built-in Biases and Flaws in Big Data Insight Extraction
Authors: Serge Galam
Abstract: I address the challenge of extracting reliable insights from large datasets using a simplified model that illustrates how hierarchical classification can distort outcomes. The model consists of discrete pixels labeled red, blue, or white. Red and blue indicate distinct properties, and white represents unclassified or ambiguous data. A macro-color is assigned only if one color holds a strict majority among the pixels. Otherwise, the aggregate is labeled white, reflecting uncertainty. This setup mimics a percolation threshold at fifty percent. Assuming direct access of the various proportions of colors is infeasible from the data, I implement a hierarchical coarse-graining procedure. Elements (first pixels, then aggregates) are recursively grouped and reclassified via local majority rules, producing ultimately a single super-aggregate whose color represents the inferred macro-property of the collection of pixels as a whole. Analytical results, supported by simulations, show that the process introduces additional white aggregates beyond white pixels, which could be initially present. These arise from groups lacking a clear majority, requiring arbitrary symmetry-breaking decisions to attribute a color to them. While each local resolution may appear minor and inconsequential, their repetitions introduce a growing systematic bias. Even with complete data, unavoidable asymmetries in local rules are shown to skew outcomes. This study highlights a critical limitation of recursive data reduction. Insight extraction is shaped not only by data quality, but by how local ambiguity is handled. That results in built-in biases. Thus, the related flaws are not due to the data, but due to structural choices made during local aggregations. Though based on a simple model, the findings expose the high likelihood of inherent flaws in widely used hierarchical classification techniques.

Title: Meson spectroscopy of exotic symmetries of Ising criticality in Rydberg atom arrays
Authors: Joseph Vovrosh, Julius de Hond, Sergi Julià-Farré, Johannes Knolle, Alexandre Dauphin
Abstract: The Ising model serves as a canonical platform for exploring emergent symmetry in quantum critical systems. The critical point of the 1D Ising chain is described by a conformal Ising field theory, which remains integrable in the presence of a magnetic perturbation leading to massive particles associated with the exceptional Lie algebra $E_8$. Coupling two Ising chains in a ladder leads to an even richer $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}_8$ symmetry. Experimental signatures of the associated particle excitations have arguably been observed in scattering studies of the spin chain material CoNb$_2$O$_6$. Here, we probe these emergent symmetries in a Rydberg atom quantum processing unit, leveraging its tunable geometry to realize both chain and ladder configurations. We identify mass spectra consistent with $E_8$ and $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}_8$ symmetries at the respective critical points. Our results demonstrate the power of Rydberg platforms for investigating symmetry emergence in quantum many-body systems and provide a direct window into the interplay of confinement, geometry and criticality.

Title: Quantum thermal state preparation for near-term quantum processors
Authors: Jerome Lloyd, Dmitry A. Abanin
Abstract: Preparation of quantum thermal states of many-body systems is a key computational challenge for quantum processors, with applications in physics, chemistry, and classical optimization. We provide a simple and efficient algorithm for thermal state preparation, combining engineered bath resetting and modulated system-bath coupling to derive a quantum channel approximately satisfying quantum detailed balance relations. We show that the fixed point $\hat\sigma$ of the channel approximates the Gibbs state as $\|\hat\sigma -\hat\sigma_\beta\|\sim \theta^2$, where $\theta$ is the system-bath coupling and $\hat\sigma_\beta \propto e^{-\beta \hat H_S}$. We provide extensive numerics, for the example of the 2D Quantum Ising model, confirming that the protocol successfully prepares the thermal state throughout the finite-temperature phase diagram, including near the quantum phase transition. Our algorithm provides a path to efficient quantum simulation of quantum-correlated states at finite temperature with current and near-term quantum processors.

Title: Primordial Metamaterials
Authors: A. Ware, J. LaMountain, R.C. White, S.R. Bank, E. Narimanov, D. Wasserman, V.A. Podolskiy
Abstract: The electromagnetic response of materials serves as the foundation for a broad range of vital applications, including but not limited to imaging, sensing, as well as classical and quantum communications. Here we demonstrate, theoretically and experimentally, a fundamentally new regime of electromagnetic material response originating from inherent material nonlocality, leading to effective ``spooky action at a distance''. We show that by structuring materials on the scale of their inherent nonlocality, it becomes possible to reveal the ``primordial'' nonlocal response of the components and design materials with strong overall nonlocality, easily detectable at room temperatures and in realistic (lossy) materials. Designer primordial nonlocality offers a new dimension in controlling light-matter interactions.

Title: Interradical motion can push magnetosensing precision towards quantum limits
Authors: Luke D. Smith, Farhan T. Chowdhury, Jonas Glatthard, Daniel R. Kattnig
Abstract: Magnetosensitive spin-correlated radical-pairs (SCRPs) offer a promising platform for noise-robust quantum metrology. However, unavoidable interradical interactions, such as electron-electron dipolar and exchange couplings, alongside deleterious perturbations resulting from intrinsic radical motion, typically degrade their potential as magnetometers. In contrast to this, we show how structured molecular motion modulating interradical interactions in a live chemical sensor in cryptochrome can, in fact, increase sensitivity and, more so, push precision in estimating magnetic field directions closer to the quantum Cramér-Rao bound, suggesting near-optimal metrological performance. Remarkably, this approach to optimality is amplified under environmental noise and persists with increasing complexity of the spin system, suggesting that perturbations inherent to such natural systems have enabled them to operate closer to the quantum limit to more effectively extract information from the weak geomagnetic field. This insight opens the possibility of channeling the underlying physical principles of motion-induced modulation of electron spin-spin interactions towards devising efficient handles over emerging molecular quantum information technologies.

Title: Quantum Assisted Ghost Gutzwiller Ansatz
Authors: P.V. Sriluckshmy, François Jamet, Fedor Šimkovic IV
Abstract: The ghost Gutzwiller ansatz (gGut) embedding technique was shown to achieve comparable accuracy to the gold standard dynamical mean-field theory method in simulating real material properties, yet at a much lower computational cost. Despite that, gGut is limited by the algorithmic bottleneck of computing the density matrix of the underlying effective embedding model, a quantity which must be converged within a self-consistent embedding loop. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical gGut technique which computes the ground state properties of embedding Hamiltonians with the help of a quantum computer, using the sample-based quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) algorithm. We study the applicability of SCI-based methods to the evaluation of the density of states for single-band Anderson impurity models within gGut and find that such ground states of interest become sufficiently sparse in the CI basis as the number of ghost orbitals is increased. Further, we investigate the performance of QSCI using local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) variational quantum states in combination with a circuit cutting technique, prepared on IQM's quantum hardware for system sizes of up to 11 ghost orbitals, equivalent to 24 qubits. We report converged gGut calculations which correctly capture the metal-to-insulator phase transition in the Fermi-Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice by using quantum samples to build an SCI basis with as little as $1\%$ of the total CI basis states.

Title: Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK
Authors: Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez
Abstract: Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Control of Spin Magnetometers
Authors: Logan W. Cooke, Stefanie Czischek
Abstract: Quantum optimal control in the presence of decoherence is difficult, particularly when not all Hamiltonian parameters are known precisely, as in quantum sensing applications. In this context, maximizing the sensitivity of the system is the objective, for which the optimal target state or unitary transformations are unknown, especially in the case of multi-parameter estimation. Here, we investigate the use of reinforcement learning (RL), specifically the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, for problems in quantum optimal control. We adopt a spin-based magnetometer as a benchmarking system for the efficacy of the SAC algorithm. In such systems, the magnitude of a background magnetic field acting on a spin can be determined via projective measurements. The precision of the determined magnitude can be optimized by applying pulses of transverse fields with different strengths. We train an RL agent on numerical simulations of the spin system to determine a transverse-field pulse sequence that optimizes the precision and compare it to existing sensing strategies. We evaluate the agent's performance against various Hamiltonian parameters, including values not seen in training, to investigate the agent's ability to generalize to different situations. We find that the RL agents are sensitive to certain parameters of the system, such as the pulse duration and the purity of the initial state, but overall are able to generalize well, supporting the use of RL in quantum optimal control settings.

Title: A computation of the covariance between two linear statistics for the Jellium model
Authors: Pete Rigas
Abstract: We extend previous results providing an exact formula for the variance of a linear statistic for the Jellium model, a one-dimensional model of Statistical mechanics obtained from the $k \longrightarrow 0^{+}$ limit of the Dyson log-gas. For such a computation of the covariance, in comparison to previous work for computations of the log-gas covariance, we obtain a formula between two linear statistics, given arbitrary functions $f$ and $g$ over the real line, that is dependent upon an asymptotic approximation of the Jellium probability distribution function from large $N$ deviations, and from an effective saddle-point action.

Title: Energy Window Augmented Plane Waves Approach to Density Functional Theory
Authors: Garry Goldstein
Abstract: In this work we present a new method for basis set generation for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids. This procedure is aimed at applications to Density Functional Theory (DFT). In this construction, Energy Window Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW), we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the self consistent eigenstates of the final (converged) Kohn Sham (KS) Hamiltonian. Here we propose that, for the basis used at each step of the self consistency iteration, we use the previous eigenstate basis, in the interstitial region, and augment it, inside each Muffin Tin (MT) sphere, with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the linearization energy of the energy window which contains the energy of that previous eigenstate. Indeed, to reduce the number of times the spherically averaged KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous break up the spectrum into non-overlapping intervals, windows, and solve the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window per angular momentum channel (at the linearization energy relevant to that window, usually near the middle of the window). For practical applications it is reasonable to have on the order of ten to one hundred windows. At each step of the iteration of the solution of the KS equations the EWAPW basis is that of near eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian for that iteration.

Title: Effective K valley Hamiltonian for TMD bilayers under pressure and application to twisted bilayers with pressure-induced topological phase transitions
Authors: Miftah Hadi Syahputra Anfa, Sabri Elatresh, Hocine Bahlouli, Michael Vogl
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies on topologically non-trivial moiré bands in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study MoTe$_2$ bilayer systems subject to pressure, which is applied perpendicular to the material surface. We start our investigation by first considering an untwisted bilayer system with an arbitrary relative shift between layers; a symmetry analysis for this case permits us to obtain a simplified effective low-energy Hamiltonian valid near the important $\mathbf{K}$ valley region of the Brillouin zone. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) was then employed to obtain relaxed geometric structures for pressures within the range of 0.0 - 3.5 GPa and corresponding band structures. The DFT data were then fitted to the low-energy Hamiltonian to obtain a pressure-dependent Hamiltonian. We then apply our model to a twisted system by treating the twist as a position-dependent shift between layers - here, we assume rigid layers, which is a crucial simplification. In summary, this approach allowed us to obtain the explicit analytical expressions for a Hamiltonian that describes a twisted MoTe\textsubscript{2} bilayer under pressure. Our Hamiltonian then permitted us to study the impact of pressure on the band topology of the twisted system. As a result, we identified many pressure-induced topological phase transitions as indicated by changes in valley Chern numbers. Moreover, we found that pressure could be employed to flatten bands in some of the cases we considered.

Title: High-Performance Thermoelectric Properties of Half-Heusler CoHfSi: A First-Principles Study with Temperature-Dependent Relaxation Time
Authors: Sadhana Matth, S. Pandey, Himanshu Pandey
Abstract: In the ongoing search for innovative thermoelectric (TE) materials with superior TE performance globally, we aim to investigate the possible use of half-Heusler alloy CoHfSi in TE applications. We analyzed the structure stability, thermodynamic inertia and electrical and thermal transport properties using density functional formalism and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. Positive phonon frequencies confirm this alloy's dynamical stability, and the Born-Huang stability criterion is also satisfied, confirming the robust mechanical stability. A large Seebeck voltage of more than 150 {\mu}V/K is estimated, an essential and typical requirement for improved heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency. This Seebeck voltage can be further increased by an order of magnitude with suitable doping. The PHONO3PY algorithm and Slack's model are used to compare the lattice thermal conductivity. The latter method gives more values than the former algorithm. Despite the commonly used constant relaxation time approximation to estimate the TE performance, we adopt the temperature-dependent relaxation time and found a clear drop in figure-of merit (zT) from those estimated without considering the lattice thermal conductivity and relaxation time both, still, the zT values are remarkably more than two, for the temperatures above 500 K, which is a striking numeral in the field of TE materials.

Title: Detection of Majorana zero modes bound to Josephson vortices in planar superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor junctions
Authors: Katharina Laubscher, Jay D. Sau
Abstract: We study signatures of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) bound to Josephson vortices in superconductor-three-dimensional topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) Josephson junctions placed in a perpendicular magnetic field. First, using semiclassical analytical as well as numerical techniques, we calculate the spatially resolved supercurrent density carried by the low-energy Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states in the junction. Motivated by a recent experiment [Yue et al., Phys. Rev. B 109, 094511 (2024)], we discuss if and how the presence of vortex MZMs is reflected in supercurrent measurements, showing that Fraunhofer signatures alone are not suitable to reliably detect vortex MZMs. Next, we propose two ways in which we believe supercurrent measurements could be complemented to further verify that the junction does indeed host MZMs. Explicitly, we discuss how additional Majorana signatures could be obtained by (1) mapping out the local density of states in the junction via scanning tunneling microscopy techniques, and (2) microwave spectroscopy of the spectrum of low-energy CdGM states in the junction.

Title: Quantum oscillation in Hopf-link semimetals
Authors: Lei Shi, Xiaoxiong Liu, C. M. Wang, Tianyu Liu, Hai-Zhou Lu, X. C. Xie
Abstract: Since the discovery of the relation between the Chern number and quantum Hall effect, searching for observables of topological invariants has been an intriguing topic. Topological Hopf-link semimetals have attracted tremendous interest, in which the conduction and valence energy bands touch at linked nodal lines. However, it is challenging to identify this sophisticated topology. We propose to use the quantum oscillation in strong magnetic fields to probe the Hopf links. For a generic model of Hopf-link semimetal that captures the linked-trivial phase transition, we figure out the phase shifts of oscillation for all Fermi pockets in all magnetic-field directions, by presenting self-consistent results from the Fermi surface tomography, Landau fan diagram, and electrical resistivity. As the magnetic field is rotated, the phase shifts exhibit a unique pattern, which could help to identify Hopf links in real materials, such as those in Li$_2$NaN.

Title: Thermodynamic Circuits: Modeling chemical reaction networks with nonequilibrium conductance matrices
Authors: Paul Raux, Christophe Goupil, Gatien Verley
Abstract: We derive the nonequilibrium conductance matrix for open stationary Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) described by a deterministic mass action kinetic equation. As an illustration, we determine the nonequilibrium conductance matrix of a CRN made of two pseudo-linear sub-networks, called chemical modules, in two different ways: First by computing the nonequilibrium conductances of the modules that are then serially connected. Second by computing the nonequilibrium conductance of the CRN directly. The two approaches coincide, as expected from our theory of thermodynamic circuits.

Title: Optical absorption and luminescence of $α$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ from the Bethe Salpeter Equation
Authors: Claudio Garcia, Walter R. L. Lambrecht
Abstract: $\alpha$-Li$_x$V$_2$O$_5$ is obtained by intercalating Li between the layers of V$_2$O$_5$. The partial filling of the split-off conduction band by electron donation from Li leads to significant changes in optical properties. Here we study the electronic band structure of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ using quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ calculations and the optical dielectric function by means of the Bethe Salpeter Equation (BSE). The half-filling of the narrow split-off band leads to a spin-splitting and formation of magnetic moments of 0.5 $\mu_B$ per V which order antiferromagnetically along the chain or $b$-direction. The imaginary part of the dielectric function shows a very strong optical absorption band near 2 eV for polarization along the $a$-direction. This absorptions stems from a localized transition between the occupied V-$d_{xy}$ derived band, which is odd with respect to the $a$-mirrorplane to the higher lying empty band formed from the same V-$d_{xy}$ orbitals but even with respect to that mirror-plane, which explains its polarization and large oscillator strength. We relate this to a recent experimental study of cathodoluminescence (CL) in which a suppression of the lowest CL peak was observed upon addition of Li. The lowest CL peak near 1.8 eV, which lies well below the indirect absorption onset of V$_2$O$_5$ is proposed to be related to recombination of a self-trapped electron polaron, resulting from oxygen vacancies, with a hole at the valence band maximum and is suppressed in LiV$_2$O$_5$ by the strong self--absorption from the Li induced occupied band to the higher empty bands at about the same energy.

Title: A Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound with a first-order system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora, Pablo Pais
Abstract: A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bounded from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations. When such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed, and the implications of these results are outlined.

Title: Controlled probing of localization effects in the non-Hermitian Aubry-André model via topolectrical circuits
Authors: Dipendu Halder, Saurabh Basu
Abstract: Anderson localization and the non-Hermitian skin effect are two distinct confinement phenomena of the eigenfunctions that are driven, respectively, by disorder and nonreciprocity. Understanding their interplay within a unified framework offers valuable insights into the localization properties of low-dimensional systems. To this end, we investigate a non-Hermitian version of the celebrated Aubry-André model, which serves as an ideal platform due to its unique self-dual properties and ability to demonstrate a delocalization-localization transition in one dimension. Interestingly, in our setting, the competition between Anderson localization and the skin effect can be precisely controlled via the complex phase of the quasiperiodic disorder. Additionally, by analyzing the time evolution, we demonstrate that quantum jumps between the skin states and the Anderson-localized states occur in the theoretical model. Further, to gain support for our theoretical predictions in an experimental platform, we propose a topolectrical circuit featuring an interface that separates two distinct electrical circuit networks. The voltage profile of the circuit exhibits confinement at the interface, analogous to the skin effect, while the phenomenon of Anderson localization in the circuit can be perceived via a predicted localization behavior near the excitation node, rather than exhibiting sudden non-Hermitian jumps, as observed in the tight-binding framework. This interplay leads to a spatially tunable localization of the output voltage of the circuit. Our findings provide deeper insights into the controlled confinement of the eigenstates of the non-Hermitian Aubry-André model by designing analogous features in topolectrical circuits, opening avenues in the fabrication of advanced electronic systems such as highly sensitive sensors and efficient devices for information transfer and communication.

Title: Towards neural reinforcement learning for large deviations in nonequilibrium systems with memory
Authors: Venkata D. Pamulaparthy, Rosemary J. Harris
Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning method for a class of non-Markov systems; our approach extends the actor-critic framework given by Rose et al. [New J. Phys. 23 013013 (2021)] for obtaining scaled cumulant generating functions characterizing the fluctuations. The actor-critic is implemented using neural networks; a particular innovation in our method is the use of an additional neural policy for processing memory variables. We demonstrate results for current fluctuations in various memory-dependent models with special focus on semi-Markov systems where the dynamics is controlled by nonexponential interevent waiting time distributions.

Title: Computational Study of Magnetic Behaviour in Ni-Adsorbed Nb2C-OF MXene using Density Functional Theory
Authors: Zarah Khan, Saleem Ayaz Khan, Ayesha Zaheer, Syed Rizwan
Abstract: Magnetic 2D materials have achieved significantly consideration owing to their encouraging applications. A variation of these 2D materials by occurrence of defects, by the transition-metal doping or adsorption or by the surface functionalization can initiate both the spin-polarization and magnetic properties in these materials. Density functional theory (DFT) is used to determine the electric, magnetic properties along with the electronic structures and stability of synthesized two-dimensional materials. This work describes the magnetic properties of Ni-ad-Nb2C-OF MXene. The study focuses on the computational approach based first principal calculation providing insight onto the magnetic properties of adsorbed compound and comparing it with pristine Nb2C-OF MXene. The pristine Nb2C-OF and Ni-ad-Nb2C-OF structures are simulated and optimized using Wien2k software. Using exchange-correlational functionals; spin-GGA and spin-GGA+U (for Nickel U= 6eV), Ni-ad-Nb2C-OF electronic band structure is found to be metallic having magnetic moment calculated +1.01516{\mu}_\b{eta} showing its non-superconducting and ferromagnetic behaviour. Owing to this magnetic nature, this 2D compound can be used for new upcoming applications such as spintronics and nano magnetic data storage devices.

Title: Negative exchange interaction in Si quantum dot arrays via valley-phase induced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field
Authors: Benjamin D. Woods
Abstract: The exchange interaction $J$ offers a powerful tool for quantum computation based on semiconductor spin qubits. However, the exchange interaction in two-electron systems in the absence of a magnetic field is usually constrained to be non-negative $J \geq 0$, which inhibits the construction of various dynamically corrected exchange-based gates. In this work, we show that negative exchange $J < 0$ can be realized in two-electron Si quantum dot arrays in the absence of a magnetic field due to the presence of the valley degree of freedom. Here, valley phase differences between dots produce a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field in the low-energy effective theory, which in turn can lead to a negative exchange interaction. In addition, we show that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field can break Nagaoka ferromagnetism and be engineered by altering the occupancy of the dot array. Therefore, our work uncovers new tools for exchange-based quantum computing and a novel setting for studying quantum magnetism.

Abstract: Magnetic systems with noncentrosymmetric crystal structures are renowned for their complex magnetic ordering and diverse and fascinating physical properties. In this report, we provide a comprehensive study of the chiral magnetic system Ni$_2$ScSbO$_6$, which exhibits a robust incommensurate long-range antiferromagnetic spin ordering at a temperature of $T_N = 62$~K, as revealed by bulk magnetization, specific heat, and neutron diffraction studies. This magnetic ordering triggers a series of intriguing phenomena, including prominent magnetodielectric coupling manifested by a dielectric peak at $T_N$, significant spin-phonon coupling resulting in strong phonon renormalization characterized by anomalous softening of various Raman modes, and a remarkable volume magnetostriction effect probed by high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction. These phenomena are intricately interlinked, positioning the present system as a rare and interesting material.

Title: Floquet-engineered diode performance in a Majorana-quantum dot Josephson junction
Authors: Koustav Roy, Gourab Paul, Debika Debnath, Kuntal Bhattacharyya, Saurabh Basu
Abstract: We study nonreciprocal signatures of Josephson current (JC) in a quantum dot (QD)-based Josephson junction (JJ) that comprises of two periodically driven Kitaev chains (KCs) coupled with an intervening QD. The simultaneous breaking of the inversion symmetry ($\mathcal{IS}$) and the time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{TRS}$), indispensable for the Josephson diode effect (JDE), is achieved solely via the two Floquet drives that differ by a finite phase, which eventually results in a nonreciprocal current, and hence yields a finite JDE. It may be noted that the Floquet Majorana modes generated at both the far ends of the KCs (away from the QD) and adjacent to the QD junctions mediate the JC owing to a finite superconducting (SC) phase difference in the two KCs. We calculate the time-averaged JC and inspect the tunability of the current-phase relation (CPR) to ascertain the diode characteristics. The asymmetric Floquet drive also manifests an anomalous JC signature in our KC-QD-KC JJ. Furthermore, additional control over the QD energy level can be achieved via an external gate voltage that renders flexibility for the Josephson diode (JD) to act as an SC switching device. Tuning different system parameters, such as the chemical potential of the KCs, Floquet frequency, the relative phase mismatch of the drives, and the gate voltage, our model shows the highest possible rectification to be around $70\%$. Summarizing, our study provides an alternative scenario, replacing the traditional usage of an external magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling effects in a JD via asymmetrically driven Kitaev leads that entail Majorana-mediated transport.

Title: Phase diagrams and two key factors to superconductivity of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates
Authors: Zhenfeng Ouyang, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has drawn great attention. Many works have been done to study the superconductivity as well as to find more superconducting RP nickelates. However, there is a lack of general understanding regarding the key factors that contribute to the superconductivity of RP nickelates. Here, we systematically study the series of RP nickelates under doping or high-pressure conditions by means of density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory. We find that enhanced quasi-particle weights and local spin fluctuation of the Ni-$e_g$ orbitals are commonly realized by hole doping or high pressure in the known superconducting RP nickelates, suggesting that they are crucial to the superconductivity. We also summarize experimentally synthesized RP nickelates into phase diagrams with local spin moment and local entanglement entropy as parameters, where phases of spin density wave/antiferromagnetism, superconductivity, and Fermi liquid are distinguished. At last, we predict a promising candidate for superconducting RP nickelates, which is constructed in a ``bilayer-trilayer'' stacking sequence.

Title: Tuning Charge Order in $κ$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$X (X=Br, Cl) via Uniaxial Strain
Authors: Jesse Liebman, Svetlana Torunova, John A. Schlueter, Elena Zhilyaeva, Natalia Drichko
Abstract: The BEDT-TTF (BEDT-TTF = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafuvalene) based Mott insulators of the form $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$X (X=Br,Cl) host a correlated electron system on a triangular lattice of (BEDT-TTF)$^{+1}_2$ dimers. Each dimer lattice site carries one hole and one S=1/2 spin which interacts antiferromagnetically. Anionic substitution has been shown to tune across a charge order transition, where unequal share of the hole between the molecules of a dimer site results in electronic ferroelectricity. We demonstrate successful tuning across the charge order transition via uniaxial strain. We use Raman scattering spectroscopy to study the local charge state and collective dipole fulctuations. We induce charge order at 33 K in the quantum dipole liquid material $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Br through application of tensile strain of 0.4% along the c-axis. We suppress charge order down to 10 K in $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Cl by applying a tensile strain of 1.6% along the b-axis. We identify the softening of collective dipole fluctuations through the charge order transition, consistent with electronic ferroelectricity. We demonstrate tuning in both directions across a second-order ferroelectric phase transition via uniaxial strain.

Title: TBHubbard: tight-binding and extended Hubbard model database for metal-organic frameworks
Authors: Pamela C. Carvalho, Federico Zipoli, Alan C. Duriez, Marco Antonio Barroca, Rodrigo Neumann Barros Ferreira, Barbara Jones, Benjamin Wunsch, Mathias Steiner
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials composed of metal ions and organic linkers. Due to their chemical diversity, MOFs can support a broad range of applications in chemical separations. However, the vast amount of structural compositions encoded in crystallographic information files complicates application-oriented, computational screening and design. The existing crystallographic data, therefore, requires augmentation by simulated data so that suitable descriptors for machine-learning and quantum computing tasks become available. Here, we provide extensive simulation data augmentation for MOFs within the QMOF database. We have applied a tight-binding, lattice Hamiltonian and density functional theory to MOFs for performing electronic structure calculations. Specifically, we provide a tight-binding representation of 10,000 MOFs, and an Extended Hubbard model representation for a sub-set of 240 MOFs containing transition metals, where intra-site U and inter-site V parameters are computed self-consistently. The data supports computational workflows for identifying structure-property correlations that are needed for inverse material design. For validation and reuse, we have made the data available at this https URL.

Title: Characterizing the Hyperuniformity of Disordered Network Metamaterials
Authors: Charles Emmett Maher, Katherine A. Newhall
Abstract: Advancements in materials design and manufacturing have allowed for the production of ordered and disordered metamaterials with diverse and novel properties. Hyperuniform two-phase heterogeneous materials, which anomalously suppress density fluctuations on large length scales compared to typical disordered systems, and network materials are two classes of metamaterial that have desirable physical properties. Recent focus has been placed on the design of disordered hyperuniform network metamaterials that inherit the desirable properties of both of these metamaterial classes. In this work, we focus on determining the extent to which network structures derived from the spatial tessellations of hyperuniform point patterns inherit the hyperuniformity of the progenitor point patterns. In particular, we examine the Delaunay, Voronoi, Delaunay-Centroidal, and Gabriel tessellations of nonhyperuniform and hyperuniform point patterns in two- and three-dimensional Euclidean space. We use the spectral density to characterize the density fluctuations of two-phase media created by thickening the edges of these tessellations in two dimensions and introduce a novel variance-based metric to characterize the network structures directly in two and three dimensions. We find that, while none of the tessellations completely inherit the hyperuniformity of the progenitor point pattern, the degree to which the hyperuniformity is inherited is sensitive to the tessellation scheme and the short- and long-range translational disorder in the point pattern, but not to the choice of beam shape when mapping the networks into two-phase media.

Title: Altermagnetism and Weak Ferromagnetism
Authors: I. V. Solovyev, S. A. Nikolaev, A. Tanaka
Abstract: Using a realistic model relevant to La$_2$CuO$_4$ and other altermagnetic perovskite oxides, we study interrelations between weak ferromagnetism (WF), anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and net orbital magnetization (OM). All of them can be linked to the form of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. Nevertheless, while spin WF is induced by the DM vector components having the same sign in all equivalent bonds, AHE and OM are related to alternating-sign components, which do not contribute to any canting of spins. The microscopic model remains invariant under the symmetry operation $\{ \mathcal{S}|{\bf t} \}$, combining the shift ${\bf t}$ of antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices to each other with the spin flip $\mathcal{S}$. Thus, the band structure remains spin-degenerate, but the time-reversal symmetry is broken, providing a possibility to realize AHE in antiferromagnetic substances. The altermagnetic splitting of bands, breaking the $\{ \mathcal{S}|{\bf t}\}$ symmetry, does not play a major role in the problem. More important is the orthorhombic strain, responsible for finite values of AHE and OM.

Title: Dipolar-exchange spin waves in thin bilayers
Authors: Rob den Teuling, Ritesh Das, Artem V. Bondarenko, Elena V. Tartakovskaya, Gerrit E. W. Bauer, Yaroslav M. Blanter
Abstract: We investigate the dipolar-exchange spin wave spectrum in thin ferromagnetic bilayers with inplane magnetization, incorporating interlayer exchange coupling and intra- and interlayer dipolar interactions. In the continuum approximation we analyze the nonreciprocity of propagating magnetic stray fields emitted by spin waves as a function of the relative orientation of the layer magnetizations that are observable by magnetometry of synthetic antiferromagnets or weakly coupled type-A van der Waals antiferromagnetic bilayers as a function of an applied magnetic field.

Title: On the influence of electrolytic gradient orientation on phoretic transport in dead-end pores
Authors: Kushagra Tiwari, Jitendra Dhakar, Kapil Upadhyaya, Akash Choudhary
Abstract: Electrolytic diffusiophoresis refers to directional migration of colloids due to interfacial forces that develop in response to local electrolytic concentration ($c$) gradients. This physicochemical transport provides an efficient alternative in numerous microscale applications where advection-induced transport is infeasible. Phoretic withdrawal and injection in dead-end pores can be controlled by orienting salt gradients into or out of the pore; however, the extent to which this orientation influences spatiotemporal transport patterns is not thoroughly explored. In this study, we find that it has a significant influence: colloidal withdrawal in solute-out mode ($\beta=c_\infty/c_{\text{pore}}<1$) is faster and shallower, whereas the solute-in mode enables deeper withdrawal. Similarly, solute-out injection features rapidly propagating wavefronts, whereas the solute-in mode ($\beta >1$) promotes uniform and gradual injection. Each mode's transport is found to evolve and persist over different time scales. We characterize the performance of these modes and find that while persistence of the solute-out mode strengthens with a growing electrolytic gradient [$\sim \ln(\beta^{-0.4})$], solute-in mode diminishes and eventually its persistence is insensitive to $\beta$. We also incorporate the variable mobility model to examine the impact of large zeta potentials, which intensifies the transport of solute-out mode further and weakens the solute-in mode. Additionally, we investigate how osmotic flows of the two modes affect injection and withdrawal patterns. We find that osmosis-induced mixing can counterintuitively inhibit injection effectiveness in solute-out mode. These insights bring attention to the distinctions between different phoretic transport modes and contribute to the rational design and setup of electrolytic gradients in numerous microscale applications.

Title: Three-stage Phase Transitions and Field-induced Phases in CeCoSi:A Landau Theory
Authors: Takayuki Ishitobi
Abstract: We investigate both the nonmagnetic and magnetic ordered phases of CeCoSi using Landau theory. Our analysis predicts three successive phase transitions at zero magnetic field. A quadrupole order parameter that emerges below $T_0=12$ K acts as a weak symmetry-breaking field on the antiferromagnetic ordering below $T_{\rm N}=9.4$ K, leading to two-stage magnetic transitions. In the higher-temperature antiferromagnetic phase within the range $T_{\rm s2}=8~{\rm K}<T<T_{\rm N}$, an out-of-plane component of the antiferromagnetic moment may or may not be present. If present, magnetic fields applied along the [100] and [110] directions induce additional magnetic phases.

Title: Boundary effects in classical liquid density fluctuations at finite temperature
Authors: Herondy Mota, K. E. L. de Farias
Abstract: We investigate thermal effects on density fluctuations in confined classical liquids using phonon quantization. The system is modeled via a massless scalar field between perfectly reflecting parallel planes with Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions. Exact closed-form expressions are derived for the mean square mass density, total energy density, and thermodynamic quantities including Helmholtz free energy and entropy densities. Our analysis identifies distinct regimes, namely, a low-temperature quantum regime exhibiting characteristic power-law behavior for each boundary condition, and a high-temperature classical regime where $\hbar$-independent behavior emerges as expected. A particularly interesting finding shows that while most quantities transition naturally to classical behavior, the mean square density fluctuation requires explicit consideration of the $\hbar\to 0$ limit. The entropy density vanishes at zero temperature, in agreement with the Nernst heat theorem. Numerical analysis confirms our analytical results, particularly the asymptotic temperature behaviors and the intermediate crossover region, in which quantum and classical effects compete. This regime is governed by the energy scale $k_B T \sim \hbar u / a$, where $a$ is the distance between the planes and $u$ is the sound velocity.

Title: Machine Learning Tool to Analyse Spectroscopic Changes in High-Dimensional Data
Authors: Alberto Martinez-Serra, Gionni Marchetti, Francesco D'Amico, Ivana Fenoglio, Barbara Rossi, Marco P. Monopoli, Giancarlo Franzese
Abstract: When nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into a biological solution, layers of biomolecules form on their surface, creating a corona. Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology. However, the influence of NP properties on protein conformation is not well understood. In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen, a crucial protein in human blood plasma, at physiological concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method offers a quantitative analysis of protein structural changes upon adsorption and enhances the understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.

Title: Spectrum Selective Interfaces and Materials towards Non-photothermal Saltwater Evaporation: Demonstration with a White Ceramic Wick
Authors: Navindra D. Singh, James Leung, Ji Feng, Alma K. González-Alcalde, Arial Tolentino, David Tuft, Juchen Guo, Luat T. Vuong
Abstract: Most solar desalination efforts are photothermal: they evaporate water with ``black'' materials that absorb as much sunlight as possible. Such ``brine-boiling'' methods are severely limited by the high thermal mass of water, i.e., its capacity to store and release heat. Here, we study the light-enhanced evaporation by a hard, white, aluminum nitride wick, which reveals a route to selectively target salt-water bonds instead of bulk heating. Evaporation rates dramatically increase with short-wavelength illumination. Violet-light illumination achieves 4-10x higher evaporation enhancement compared to orange and IR light. Our results identify a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation and opportunities to employ ceramic wicks for salt harvesting. Such low-cost, low-energy desalination systems would reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies and contribute to new cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.

Title: A General Approach to the Shape Transition of Run-and-Tumble Particles: The 1D PDMP Framework for Invariant Measure Regularity
Authors: Leo Hahn
Abstract: Run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) have emerged as a paradigmatic example for studying nonequilibrium phenomena in statistical mechanics. The invariant measure of a wide class of RTPs subjected to a potential possesses a density that is continuous at high tumble rates but exhibits divergences at low ones. This key feature, known as shape transition, constitutes a qualitative indicator of the relative closeness (continuous density) or strong deviation (diverging density) from the equilibrium setting. Furthermore, the points at which the density diverges correspond to the configurations where the system spends most of its time in the low tumble rate regime. Building on and extending existing results concerning the regularity of the invariant measure of one-dimensional piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), we show how to characterize the shape transition even in situations where the invariant measure cannot be computed explicitly. Our analysis confirms shape transition as a robust, general feature of RTPs subjected to a potential. We also refine the regularity theory for the invariant measure of one-dimensional PDMPs.

Title: Phase Transition of the Ising Model on a 3-Dimensional Fractal Lattice
Authors: Jozef Genzor, Roman Krčmár, Hiroshi Ueda, Denis Kochan, Andrej Gendiar, Tomotoshi Nishino
Abstract: The critical behavior of the classical Ising model on a three-dimensional fractal lattice with Hausdorff dimension $d_H = \ln32 / \ln4 = 2.5$ is investigated using the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG) method. We determine the critical temperature $T_c \approx 2.65231$ and the critical exponents for magnetization $\beta \approx 0.059$ and field response $\delta \approx 35$. Unlike a previously studied 2D fractal with $d_H \approx 1.792$, the specific heat for this 3D fractal exhibits a divergent singularity at $T_c$. The results are compared with those for regular lattices and other fractal structures to elucidate the role of dimensionality in critical phenomena.

Title: Orbital FFLO and layer-selective FFLO phases in trilayer NbSe$_2$
Authors: Michiya Chazono, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: Finite-momentum superconductivity has become an important research topic in condensed matter physics. In particular, the orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, which is stabi lized in atomically thin films by the orbital effect of an external magnetic field, has been getting attention as a fascinating finite-momentum superconducting state recently. We study the phase diagram of the trilayer Ising superconductor NbSe$_2$ in the in-plane magnetic field, taking into ac count the orbital effect, the paramagnetic effect, and the spin-orbit coupling. The finite-momentum gap structure in the high-field region is shown by a large-scale numerical calculation based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. We find an exotic superconducting phase, a layer-selective FFLO phase, in which finite-momentum Cooper pairs coexist with zero-momentum Cooper pairs, separated from the orbital FFLO phase.

Title: Theoretical study on ambient pressure superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films : structural analysis, model construction, and robustness of $s\pm$-wave pairing
Authors: Kensei Ushio, Shu Kamiyama, Yuto Hoshi, Ryota Mizuno, Masayuki Ochi, Kazuhiko Kuroki, Hirofumi Sakakibara
Abstract: We theoretically study ambient pressure superconductivity in thin films of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We construct model Hamiltonians adopting the crystal structure theoretically determined by fixing the in-plane lattice constant to those substrates examined in the experiment. We also construct a model based on the experimentally determined lattice structure. To the models obtained, we apply the fluctuation exchange approximation, which takes into account the full momentum and frequency dependencies of the Green function and the pairing interaction. We find that the electronic structure, including the presence/absence of the so-called $\gamma$-pocket (the Fermi surface originating from the top of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bonding band) depends on the crystal structure adopted and/or the presence/absence of $+U$ correction in the band structure calculation. Nonetheless, $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust regardless of these details in the band structure. The robustness of the $s\pm$-wave pairing mainly owes to the large sign changing superconducting gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bands around $(k_x,k_y)=(0,0)$ and $(k_x,k_y)=(\pi,\pi)$, which originates from the finite energy spin fluctuations. On the other hand, $T_c$ being halved from that of the pressurized bulk can only be understood by adopting the model with small $|t_\perp|$ derived from the experimentally determined crystal structure, at least within the present FLEX approach, although there may remain some other possibilities beyond this approach for the origin of the reduced $T_c$.

Authors: Simon Svab, Rafael S. Eggli, Taras Patlatiuk, Miguel J. Carballido, Pierre Chevalier Kwon, Dominique A. Trüssel, Ang Li, Erik P.A.M. Bakkers, Andreas V. Kuhlmann, Dominik M. Zumbühl
Abstract: Pauli Spin Blockade (PSB) is a key paradigm in semiconductor nanostructures and gives access to the spin physics. We report the direct observation of PSB with gate-dispersive reflectometry on double quantum dots with source-drain bias. The reservoir charge transitions are strongly modulated, turning on and off when entering and leaving the blockaded region, consistent with a simple model. Seen with holes in Ge and Si, the effects are enhanced with larger bias voltage and suppressed by magnetic field. This work lays the foundation for fast probing of spin physics and minimally invasive spin readout.

Title: Partial Landau-Zener transitions and applications to qubit shuttling
Authors: Jonas R. F. Lima, Guido Burkard
Abstract: The transition dynamics of two-state systems with time-dependent energy levels, first considered by Landau, Zener, Majorana, and Stückelberg, is one of the basic models in quantum physics and has been used to describe various physical systems. We propose here a generalization of the Landau-Zener (LZ) problem characterized by distinct paths of the instantaneous eigenstates as the system evolves in time while keeping the instantaneous eigenenergies exactly as in the standard LZ model. We show that these paths play an essential role in the transition probability $P$ between the two states, and can lead to a substantial reduction of $P$, being possible even to achieve $P=0$ in an instructive extreme case, and also to large $P$ even in the absence of any anticrossing point. The partial LZ model can describe valley transition dynamics during charge and spin shuttling in semiconductor quantum dots.

Title: Dynamical Structure Factor from Weak Measurements
Authors: E. Altuntas, R. G. Lena, S. Flannigan, A. J. Daley, I. B. Spielman
Abstract: Much of our knowledge of quantum systems is encapsulated in the expectation value of Hermitian operators, experimentally obtained by averaging projective measurements. However, dynamical properties are often described by products of operators evaluated at different times; such observables cannot be measured by individual projective measurements, which occur at a single time. For example, the dynamical structure factor describes the propagation of density excitations, such as phonons, and is derived from the spatial density operator evaluated at different times. Conventionally, this is measured by first exciting the system at a specific wavevector and frequency, then measuring the response. Here, we describe an alternative approach using a pair of time-separated weak measurements, and analytically show that their cross-correlation function directly recovers the dynamical structure factor. We provide numerical confirmation of this technique with a matrix product states simulation of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, weakly measured by phase contrast imaging. We explore the limits of the method and demonstrate its applicability to real experiments with limited imaging resolution.

Title: Few-fermion resonant tunneling and underbarrier trapping in asymmetric potentials
Authors: Elvira Bilokon, Valeriia Bilokon, Dusty R. Lindberg, Lev Kaplan, Andrii Sotnikov, Denys I. Bondar
Abstract: Understanding quantum tunneling in many-body systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies and nanoscale device design. Despite extensive studies of quantum tunneling, the role of interactions in determining directional transport through asymmetric barriers in discrete quantum systems remains unclear. Here we show that noninteracting fermions exhibit symmetric tunneling probabilities regardless of barrier orientation, while inter-particle interactions break this symmetry and create pronounced asymmetric tunneling behavior. We explore the dependence of tunneling behavior on the initial spin configurations of two spin-1/2 fermions: spin-triplet states preserve tunneling symmetry, while spin-singlet states show strong asymmetry. We identify regimes where interactions mediate tunneling through under-barrier resonant trapping and enhance tunneling via many-body resonant tunneling -- a phenomenon arising solely from inter-particle interactions and being fundamentally different from traditional single-particle resonant tunneling. Our results may be applied to the design of nanoscale devices with tailored transport properties, such as diodes and memristors.

Title: Amplifying microwave pulses with a single qubit engine fueled by quantum measurements
Authors: Rémy Dassonneville, Cyril Elouard, Romain Cazali, Réouven Assouly, Audrey Bienfait, Alexia Auffèves, Benjamin Huard
Abstract: Recent progress in manipulating individual quantum systems enables the exploration of engines exploiting non-classical resources. One of the most appealing is the energy provided by the inherent backaction of quantum measurements. While a handful of experiments have investigated the inner dynamics of engines fueled by measurement backaction, powering a useful task by such an engine is missing. Here we demonstrate the amplification of microwave signals by an engine fueled by repeated quantum measurements of a superconducting transmon qubit. Using feedback, the engine acts as a quantum Maxwell demon operating without a hot thermal source. Measuring the gain of this amplification constitutes a direct probing of the work output of the engine, in contrast with inferring the work by measuring the qubit state along its evolution. Observing a good agreement between both work estimation methods, our experiment validates the accuracy of the indirect method. We characterize the long-term stability of the engine as well as its robustness to transmon decoherence, loss and drifts. Our experiment exemplifies a practical usage of the energy brought by quantum measurement backaction.

Title: Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships in materials leveraging microstructure representation from foundational vision transformers
Authors: Sheila E. Whitman, Marat I. Latypov
Abstract: Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships from data is an emerging approach in computational materials science. Most existing machine learning efforts focus on the development of task-specific models for each microstructure--property relationship. We propose utilizing pre-trained foundational vision transformers for the extraction of task-agnostic microstructure features and subsequent light-weight machine learning of a microstructure-dependent property. We demonstrate our approach with pre-trained state-of-the-art vision transformers (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM) in two case studies on machine-learning: (i) elastic modulus of two-phase microstructures based on simulations data; and (ii) Vicker's hardness of Ni-base and Co-base superalloys based on experimental data published in literature. Our results show the potential of foundational vision transformers for robust microstructure representation and efficient machine learning of microstructure--property relationships without the need for expensive task-specific training or fine-tuning of bespoke deep learning models.

Title: Dynamics of monitored SSH Model in Krylov Space: From Complexity to Quantum Fisher Information
Authors: Nilachal Chakrabarti, Neha Nirbhan, Arpan Bhattacharyya
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a non-Hermitian SSH model that arises out of the no-click limit of a monitored SSH model in the Krylov space. We find that the saturation timescale of the complexity associated with the spread of the state in the Krylov subspace increases with the measurement rate, and late time behaviour differs across the $\mathrm{PT}$ symmetry transition point. Furthermore, extending the notion of this complexity for subsystems in Krylov space, we find that the scaling of its late time value with subsystem size shows a discontinuous jump across the $\mathrm{PT}$ transition point, indicating that it can be used as a suitable order parameter for such transition but not for the measurement-induced transition. Finally, we show that a generalized measure in the Krylov subspace, which contains information about the correlation landscape, such as Quantum Fisher information, which also possesses some structural similarity with the complexity functional, can be a promising probe of the measurement-induced phase.

Title: Percolation thresholds and connectivity in quantum networks
Authors: Andrea De Girolamo, Giuseppe Magnifico, Cosmo Lupo
Abstract: We study entanglement percolation in qubit-based planar quantum network models of arbitrary topology, where neighboring nodes are initially connected by pure states with quenched disorder in their entanglement. To address this, we develop a physics-informed heuristic algorithm designed to find a sequence of entanglement swapping and distillation operations to connect any pair of distant nodes. The algorithm combines locally optimal percolation strategies between nodes at a maximum distance of one swapping operation. If this fails to produce a maximally entangled state, it looks for alternative paths surrounding intermediate states within the process. We analytically find and numerically verify thresholds in quantum percolation, which depend on the initial network configuration and entanglement, and are associated with specific percolation strategies. We classify these strategies based on the connectivity, a quantity that relates the entanglement in the final state and the level of integrity of the network at the end of the process. We find distinct regimes of quantum percolation, which are clearly separated by the percolation thresholds of the employed strategies and vastly vary according to the network topology.

Title: Elastic Planetoids
Authors: Bartosz Żbik, Andrzej Odrzywołek
Abstract: Modeling the internal structure of self-gravitating solid and liquid bodies presents a challenge, as existing approaches are often limited to either overly simplistic constant-density approximations or more complex numerical equations of state. We present a detailed analysis of a tractable and physically motivated model for perfectly elastic, spherically symmetric self-gravitating bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium. The model employs a logarithmic equation of state (logotropic EOS) with a non-zero initial density and constant bulk modulus. Importantly, scaling properties of the model allow all solutions to be derived from a single, universal solution of an ordinary differential equation, resembling the Lane-Emden and Chandrasekhar models. The model provides new insights into stability issues and reveals oscillatory asymptotic behavior in the mass-radius relation, including the existence of both a maximum mass and a maximum radius. We derive useful, simple analytical approximations for key properties, such as central overdensity, moment of inertia, binding energy, and gravitational potential, applicable to small, metallic bodies like asteroids and moons. These new approximations could aid future research, including space mining and the scientific characterization of small Solar System bodies.

Title: Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional
Authors: Sanjeev Raja, Martin Šípka, Michael Psenka, Tobias Kreiman, Michal Pavelka, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan
Abstract: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific approaches in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.

Title: Strongly Coupled Exciton--Hyperbolic-phonon-polariton Hybridized States in hBN-encapsulated Biased Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Tomer Eini, N. M. R. Peres, Yarden Mazor, Itai Epstein
Abstract: Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.
