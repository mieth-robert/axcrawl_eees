Title: Topological passivation makes high strength alloys insensitive to hydrogen embrittlement
Authors: Huijie Cheng, Binhan Sun, Aochen Zhang, Dirk Ponge, Fengkai Yan, Tiwen Lu, Xian-Cheng Zhang, Dierk Raabe, Shan-Tung Tu
Abstract: Infrastructure parts for a hydrogen (H) economy need alloys that are mechanically strong and at the same time resistant to the most dangerous and abrupt type of failure mode, namely, H embrittlement. These two properties are in fundamental conflict, as increasing strength typically amplifies susceptibility to H-related failure. Here, we introduce a new approach to make alloys resistant to H embrittlement, by creating a topological passivation layer (up to a few hundred micrometers thick) near the material surface, the region that is most vulnerable to H ingress and attack. It features instead a layer of ultrafine laminated grains with tens of times higher dislocation density than conventional materials, altering H diffusion, trapping and crack evolution. We tested the concept on a face-centered cubic (FCC) CoCrNi medium entropy model alloy which undergoes severe H-induced intergranular cracking. Two key mechanisms create the topological passivation: First, the high density (up to ~1.3e15 m-2) of H-trapping dislocations within the passivating grain layer decelerates H migration by up to about an order of magnitude, delaying H-induced crack initiation at grain boundaries. More importantly, once unavoidable micro-sized H-induced intergranular cracks emerge in the topmost surface region, they become completely arrested by the laminated grains, due to a transition in the embrittlement mechanism from H-enhanced grain boundary decohesion to highly energy-dissipative dislocation-associated cracking. These effects almost completely eliminate H embrittlement, at even doubled yield strength, when exposing the so architected material to harsh H attack. Our approach leverages surface mechanical treatments to tailor metallic microstructures in surface regions most susceptible to H attack, providing a scalable solution to protect alloys from H-induced damage.

Title: Generic rigidity and accidental modes in metal-organic frameworks
Authors: Christopher M. Owen, Michael J. Lawler
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) combine high porosity with structural fragility, raising important questions about their mechanical stability. We develop a rigidity-based framework in which spring networks parameterized by UFF4MOF are used to construct rigidity and dynamical matrices. Large-scale analysis of 5,682 MOFs from the CoRE 2019 database shows that most frameworks are formally over-constrained yet cluster sharply near the isostatic threshold, revealing accidental geometric modes and placing many MOFs near mechanical instability. In the representative case of UiO-66, we show that auxiliary long-range constraints introduced by tuning the neighbor cutoff lift these modes into soft, flat, finite-frequency bands. The results show that rigidity-matrix analysis can rapidly identify MOFs likely to remain mechanically stable. This near-criticality mirrors behavior known from topological mechanics and points to a deeper design principle in porous crystals.

Title: Tuning Universality in Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Arsham Ghavasieh
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit crackling-like avalanches whose origin lacks a mechanistic explanation. Here, I derive a stochastic theory of deep information propagation (DIP) by incorporating Central Limit Theorem (CLT)-level fluctuations. Four effective couplings $(r, h, D_1, D_2)$ characterize the dynamics, yielding a Landau description of the static exponents and a Directed Percolation (DP) structure of activity cascades. Tuning the couplings selects between avalanche dynamics generated by a Brownian Motion (BM) in a logarithmic trap and an absorbed free BM, each corresponding to a distinct universality classes. Numerical simulations confirm the theory and demonstrate that activation function design controls the collective dynamics in random DNNs.

Title: Exploring the apparent violation of the Mott relation in a noncentrosymmetric kagome ferromagnet
Authors: Benjamin Kostroun, Tomoya Asaba, Sean M. Thomas, Eric D. Bauer, Sergey Y. Savrasov, Filip Ronning, Vsevolod Ivanov
Abstract: In magnetic topological materials, time-reversal symmetry breaking gives rise to topological point and line nodes with distinctive signatures in the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst conductivity that satisfy the well-known Mott relation. However, this relationship can fail for doping-dependent transport measurements of materials with complex magnetism, topology, and electronic correlations. In this work, we present transport measurements of the correlated topological metal UCoAl doped with Ru, which appear to violate the Mott relation. We develop a model that captures the evolution of Stoner magnetism and topological Weyl points as a function of doping. Using this model, we show how the correlated flat band in this material pins the Weyl points to the Fermi energy, and demonstrate how this explains the unusual doping-dependent behavior of the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst conductivities in this material, while the Mott relation is in fact satisfied at each doping level.

Title: Purely even harmonic Josephson current due to crossed pair transmission across strongly spin-polarized materials
Authors: Niklas L. Schulz, Danilo Nikolić, Matthias Eschrig
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the second harmonic generation in the current-phase relation across ferromagnetic bilayers placed between BCS superconductors. In particular, we consider a strongly spin-polarized metallic ferromagnet coupled to two superconducting leads via thin spin-active (left) and non-spin-active (right) insulating layers. The system is examined in the framework of the quasiclassical Green$^\prime$s function formalism, both in the ballistic (Eilenberger) and the diffusive (Usadel) limit. Strong spin polarization allows for neglecting short-range mixed-spin correlations, and the Josephson supercurrent across the ferromagnet is fully mediated by long-range equal-spin triplet correlations. Using a diagrammatic technique for ballistic propagators introduced in Refs. [1-3], we describe the relevant Andreev processes responsible for the effective conversion of two spin-singlet Cooper pairs in the superconductor into two $\uparrow\uparrow$ and $\downarrow\downarrow$ pairs in the ferromagnet. Contrary to the naive picture of direct conversion, we show that the lowest order process involves four Cooper pairs in the superconductor, among which three are incoming, and one is outgoing, giving rise to net charge transport of 4e across the non-spin-active interface. The self-consistent numerical treatment of the diffusive junction, typically more relevant in experiments, confirms this picture quantitatively.

Title: Resonant Dyakonov-Shur Magnetoplasmons in Graphene Terahertz Photodetectors

Delgado-Notario, Cedric Bray, Elsa Perez-Martin, Ben Benhamou-Bui, Namrata Saha, Sahil Parvez, Christophe.Consejo, Guillaume Sigu, Salah Benlemqwanssa, Laurent Bonnet, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, José M. Caridad, Sergey S. Krishtopenko, Yahya M. Meziani, Benoit Jouault, Jérémie Torres, Sandra Ruffenach, Frédéric Teppe
Abstract: Graphene plasmons confine incident terahertz fields far below the diffraction limit and, when hosted by a gate-defined Fabry-Perot cavity, enable electrically tunable, frequency-selective photodetectors. In a magnetic field, these plasmons hybridize with the cyclotron motion to form magnetoplasmons, offering a platform for fundamental studies and for nonreciprocal, spectrally selective, ultrasensitive terahertz photonics. However, implementing magnetoplasmon-assisted resonant transistors at terahertz frequencies has remained challenging so far. Here we use gate-dependent, on-chip terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy combined with a perpendicular magnetic field to resolve and probe the evolution of resonant magnetoplasmons in antenna-coupled monolayer and bilayer graphene TeraFETs. In monolayer graphene the dispersion reflects the Dirac nature of the carriers, exhibiting a non-monotonic density dependence due to the interplay of plasma resonance and cyclotron motion, with an inflection point at maximal plasmon-cyclotron coupling. In contrast, in bilayer graphene we recover and map a magnetoplasmon dispersion consistent with the conventional Schrödinger-type picture. These results establish graphene TeraFET devices as a robust on-chip platform for resonant magnetoplasmonics at terahertz frequencies, enabling magnetically programmable, frequency-selective photonics and opening avenues toward photodetectors with enhanced sensitivity.

Title: Dissipation and fluctuations of CMOS ring oscillators close to criticality
Authors: Ashwin Gopal, Massimiliano Esposito, Jan Meibohm
Abstract: We analyze a thermodynamically consistent model of CMOS-based ring oscillators near the onset of coherent voltage oscillations. For driving voltages close to the critical value, we derive the normal form of the Hopf bifurcation that underlies the oscillation transition in the thermodynamic limit. Using this normal form, we determine the phase and amplitude dynamics, and demonstrate that entropy dissipation decreases in the oscillating state for ring oscillators with more than three inverters. These findings culminate in a stability-dissipation relation, which links the observed decrease in dissipation to an increase in the local stability of the oscillating state. Next, we characterize finite-size fluctuations of the amplitude and phase near the critical voltage, using a stochastic version of the normal form. We demonstrate that close to the transition, finite-size fluctuations remain important at arbitrary system size, introducing oscillations even below the critical voltage. We further show that these noise-induced oscillations have an anomalously short decoherence time that scales sub-linearly with the system-size, in contrast to the behavior far from criticality.

Title: Understanding the Role of Particle Deformability on the Crystal and Glass formation using Two-dimensional Ring Polymer Model
Authors: Padmanabha Bose, Smarajit Karmakar
Abstract: Soft matter systems are common in nature and make up nearly all the essential components necessary for life, from cells to the organelles within those cells. The ability of these soft materials to deform is crucial for the proper functioning of various biological processes, such as blood flow in our veins and arteries. It is vital to understand how deformability influences the normal functioning of these processes. We have investigated an assembly of two-dimensional (2D) polymeric non-overlapping rings via extensive molecular dynamics simulations. The main idea is to study an assembly of model particles with anisotropic deformability using polymer rings. By tuning the degree of deformability of these model deformable particles, we study the dynamic and static properties of the assembly at different densities and temperatures. This deformable particle model might correspond to an assembly of epithelial cells or similar biologically soft bodies. In the limit at which the rings are very rigid with very little deformability, one expects to see the formation of a triangular lattice by the centres of these polymer rings. On the other hand, if one increases the deformability of these polymer rings, due to increased disorder, one observes glass-like dynamical behaviour even for identically sized polymer rings. We also show a transition from a crystalline state to a disordered glassy state driven solely by particle deformability. We observe non-trivial finite-size effects in the dynamics of these glass-forming ring polymers, not seen in usual molecular glass-formers.

Title: Robust semiclassical magnetization plateau in the kagome lattice
Authors: Gabriel Capelo, Eric C. Andrade
Abstract: Inspired by recent observations of the $1/3$ magnetization plateau in kagome-based magnets, we investigate the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice under the influence of an external magnetic field. Although the classical ground state at zero field depends on the sign of $J_2$, we find a robust $1/3$ semiclassical magnetization plateau in both cases. The mechanism that stabilizes this plateau is analogous to that observed in the triangular lattice, where quantum fluctuations select a collinear state from the degenerate classical manifold. We calculate the plateau width, which shows a weak dependence on $J_2$, using nonlinear spin-wave theory. Additionally, we find that a straightforward approach based on linear spin-wave yields quantitatively accurate results even for $S=1/2$. Furthermore, we identify a magnetization jump at the saturation field when $J_2=0$; this jump is related to the presence of a flat band and disappears for $J_2 \neq 0$. Our study demonstrates that a semiclassical approach effectively captures the $1/3$ plateau in the kagome lattice and serves as a valuable tool for interpreting experimental and numerical results alike.

Title: Polar and apolar light-induced alignment of ferroelectric nematic at photosensitive polymer substrate
Authors: Ruslan Kravchuk, Oleksandr Kurochkin, Vassili G. Nazarenko, Volodymyr Sashuk, Mykola Kravets, Bijaya Basnet, Oleg D. Lavrentovich
Abstract: Surface alignment of a recently discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (NF) is usually achieved by buffed polymer films, which produce a unidirectional polar alignment of the spontaneous electric polarization. We demonstrate that photosensitive polymer substrates could provide a wider variety of alignment modes. Namely, a polyvinyl cinnamate polymer film irradiated by linearly polarized ultraviolet (UV) light yields two modes of surface orientation of the NF polarization. (1) A planar apolar mode, in which the equilibrium NF polarization aligns perpendicularly to the polarization of normally impinging UV light; the NF polarization adopts either of the two antiparallel states. (2) A planar polar mode, produced by an additional irradiation with obliquely impinging UV light. In this mode, there is only one stable azimuthal direction of polarization in the plane of the substrate. The two modes differ in their response to an electric field. In the planar apolar mode, polarization can be switched between two states of equal surface energy. In the planar polar mode, the field-perturbed polarization relaxes back to the single photoinduced easy axis once the field is switched off. The versatility of modes and absence of mechanical contact make the photoalignment of the NF attractive for practical applications.

Title: Magnetosynthesis effect on the structure and ground state of Cu$^{2+}$-based antiferromagnets
Authors: Micaela E. Primer, Anna A. Berseneva, Ayesha Ulde, Wenhao Sun, Rebecca W. Smaha
Abstract: Subtle synthetic variables can have an outsizes influence on the crystal structure and magnetic properties of a material, particularly those of quantum materials. In this work, we investigate the impact of synthesis under a magnetic field (magnetosynthesis) on the crystal structure and magnetic properties of several Cu$^{2+}$ ($S=1/2$) based materials with antiferromagnetic interactions and varying levels of magnetic frustration, from simple antiferromagnets to a quantum spin liquid. We employ small (0.09 - 0.37 T) magnetic fields applied during low-temperature hydrothermal or evaporative synthesis of the simple antiferromagnet CuCl$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O, the canted antiferromagnet (Cu,Zn)$_3$Cl$_4$(OH)$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O, the frustrated and canted antiferromagnet atacamite Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Cl, and the highly frustrated quantum spin liquid herbertsmithite Cu$_3$Zn(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$. We found that (Cu,Zn)$_3$Cl$_4$(OH)$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O experiences structural changes well above its magnetic transition. Atacamite Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Cl synthesized under a 0.19 T field experiences a 0.15 K (~3%) decrease in its Néel transition temperature and a significant strengthening of its antiferromagnetic interactions, suggesting that magnetosynthesis can influence the ground state of moderately frustrated materials.

Title: Bend Instabilities and Topological Turbulence in Shear-Aligned Living Liquid Crystal
Authors: Hend Baza, Fei Chen, Taras Turiv, Sergij V. Shiyanovskii, Oleg D. Lavrentovich
Abstract: Flagellated microswimmers B. Subtilis dispersed in a nematic phase of a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal form a living liquid crystal (LLC). The combination of the passive and active components allows us to analyze how the active component transitions from the shear-imposed alignment into topological turbulence. The lateral extension of the experimental cell is 1000 times larger than the 10-micrometer thickness, to avoid the effect of lateral confinement on the dynamic patterns. The surface anchoring is azimuthally degenerate to avoid permanent anisotropy. After the shear cessation, active forces produced by the microswimmers trigger self-amplifying bend undulations. The amplitude of undulations grows with time and then saturates, while the wavelength increases only slightly. Strong bend stresses at the extrema of undulations are released by nucleating disclination pairs, which multiply to produce topological turbulence. The nucleating pairs and the symmetry axes of the +1/2 disclinations are orientationally ordered. In highly active LLCs, this alignment causes a nonmonotonous time dependence of the disclinations' number, as a fast-moving +1/2 disclination of one pair annihilates a -1/2 disclination of the neighboring pair. The spectra of elastic and kinetic energies exhibit distinct wavevector dependencies caused by the energy cost of the deformed passive nematic background. The study demonstrates how applied shears and a passive viscoelastic background affect the dynamics of active matter. Combined with the previously determined viscoelastic properties of the lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal, the results complete a comprehensive description of the experimentally assessable type of active matter.

Title: Roles of Polarization and Detuning in the Noise-induced Relaxation Dynamics of Atomic-Molecular Bose Condensates
Authors: Avinaba Mukherjee, Raka Dasgupta
Abstract: We study the relaxation process of a resonant Bose gas under the influence of Gaussian white noise. We characterize the system dynamics in terms of the polarization or imbalance between the atoms and molecules, and the system coherence. The relaxation times corresponding to these two quantities are studied both using a mean-field model, and a Born Green Kirkwood Yvon hierarchy that takes into account the higher-order correlations. The role of the initial polarization and the Feshbach detuning are investigated. It is found with an increasing initial population imbalance, the longituidinal relaxation time (that governs the dyanamics of the polarization) grows, while the transverse relaxation time (that governs the dynamics of the coherence) decays. As for the varying Feshbach detuning, it is observed that the longituidinal relaxation time reaches its minima and its transverse counterpart reaches its maxima near the resonance. We also study how the initial polarization and the detuning affect physical quantities like drift speed, condensate fraction, fidelity and entanglement entropy etc, and find the results to be fully consistent with the behavior of the relaxation dynamics of the system.

Title: Interpretable Graph Neural Networks for Classifying Structure and Magnetism in Delafossite Compounds
Authors: Jovin Ryan Joseph, Do Hoon Kiem, Sinchul Yeom, Mina Yoon
Abstract: Delafossites (ABC2, where A and B are metals and C is a chalcogen) are a versatile family of quantum materials and layered oxides/chalcogenides whose properties are highly sensitive to atomic composition and stacking geometry. Their broad chemical tunability makes them an ideal platform for large-scale combinatorial exploration and high-throughput computational screening with desirable quantum properties. In this work, we employ a Concept Whitening Graph Neural Network, a gray-box AI model, to classify delafossite structures by stacking sequence and magnetic states. By aligning learned representations with human-interpretable physical concepts, this gray-box approach enables both accurate prediction and insight into the structural and chemical features driving magnetic behavior. The magnetic-ordering models achieved validation accuracies exceeding 80 percent, with a further slight uptick observed in the model incorporating the largest number of concepts. Concept alignment analysis revealed measurable learning across nine physically meaningful descriptors, with coefficients of determination ranging from approximately 0.6 for the d-shell valence-electron concepts to 0.4-0.5 for the magnetic coupling parameters. Furthermore, we mapped the concept importances onto the material graph representation, elucidating interpretable physical trends and the progression of stable concept-aligned regions across training. These results demonstrate the potential of interpretable graph-based learning to capture the underlying physics of complex materials systems and provide an interpretable framework for accelerating the discovery and understanding of delafossites and related crystalline materials.

Title: Dual instability of superconductivity from oxygen defects in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7+δ}$
Authors: Peiheng Jiang, Jie Li, Yu-Han Cao, Xiaodong Cao, Zhicheng Zhong, Yi Lu, Qiang-Hua Wang
Abstract: We uncover a dual mechanism by which oxygen defects suppress superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$ using density functional theory, dynamical mean-field theory, and functional renormalization group analysis. Apical vacancies and interbilayer interstitials emerge as the dominant low-energy defect species and are further stabilized by orthorhombic domain walls. These two defect classes drive the electronic structure in opposing directions. Vacancy-induced disorder generates local magnetic moments and promotes Anderson localization at moderate concentrations, whereas periodic interstitial ordering yields a coherent but weakly correlated metallic background that fails to support superconductivity. These findings highlight the decisive role of oxygen defects in shaping the superconducting and provide microscopic guidance for improving superconductivity through controlled defect engineering.

Title: Classification of coherent peaks in two-terminal quantum devices into normal and anomalous Kondo peaks
Authors: Jongbae Hong
Abstract: Coherent peaks arising in the differential conductance of quantum dot (QD) and quantum point contact (QPC) devices are classified into two categories, normal and anomalous Kondo peaks, according to the underlying spin dynamics and the form of the scaling function to which the scaled temperature-dependent linear conductance collapses. The zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) observed in QPCs and in the triplet state of the even sector of quantum dot single-electron transistors (QDSETs) are identified as normal Kondo peaks, formed by spin dynamics involving spin exchange, a symbolic characteristic of the Kondo effect. For these ZBPs, the scaling temperature coincides with half the full width at half maximum (FWHM). In contrast, the ZBP observed in the odd sector of QDSETs and all finite-bias coherent peaks, including the coherent side peaks of QPCs and the split ZBP in the singlet state of the QDSET even sector, are identified as anomalous Kondo peaks, because they arise from spin dynamics without spin exchange, and their scaling temperature does not coincide with half the FWHM. To support these findings, we reproduce gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance line shapes measured in the odd sector of a QDSET, demonstrating that its ZBP originates from a combination of two coherent side peaks explicitly observed in QPCs.

Title: Band inversion transition in HgTe nanowire grown along the [001] direction
Authors: Rui Li
Abstract: The low-energy effective Hamiltonian of a cylindrical HgTe nanowire grown along the [001] crystallographic direction is constructed by using the perturbation theory. Both the anisotropic term and the bulk inversion asymmetry term of the Kane model are taken into account. Although the anisotropic term has converted the crossing between the $E_{1}$ and $H_{1}$ subbands into an anticrossing at $k_{z}R\!=\!0$, the gap-closing-and-reopening transition in the subband structure can still occur at the wave vectors $k_{z}R\!\approx\!\pm0.24$ for critical nanowire radius $R\!\approx\!3.45$ nm. The bulk inversion asymmetry does not contribute to the low-energy effective Hamiltonian, i.e., there is no spin splitting in the $E_{1}$, $H_{1}$, and $H_{2}$ subbands for a [001] oriented cylindrical nanowire.

Title: Emergent Anomalous and Topological Hall Responses in an Epitaxial Ferromagnetic Weyl Nodal-Line metal Fe5Si3
Authors: Shubhashish Pati, Sonali Srotaswini Pradhan, Abhay Pandey, Nikita Sharma, Nanhe Kumar Gupta, Nakul Kumar, Nidhi Shukla, Saurav Singh, Vidhi Jain, Mitali, V. Kanchana, Sujeet Chaudhary
Abstract: The interplay between real and reciprocal space topology yields intrinsically linked transport phenomena in magnetic Weyl systems, wherein the broken time-reversal symmetry, strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and pronounced uniaxial anisotropy stabilize the momentum-space Berry-curvature monopoles (Weyl nodes) and real-space chiral spin textures. We present a combined first-principles and experimental study of epitaxial Fe5Si3 thin films, establishing them as a magnetic Weyl nodal-line material. First-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations unambiguously reveal that Fe5Si3 hosts a topologically nontrivial electronic structure containing six pairs of Weyl nodes at or near the Fermi level, accompanied by pronounced Berry curvature at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin Zone. High-quality epitaxial films exhibit robust ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature of ~370 K and strong magneto crystalline anisotropy. The magneto transport measurements on epitaxial films reveal the corresponding Berry curvature-driven responses, including a significantly large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of 504 S/cm and a high anomalous Hall angle of 5.5%, which is in good agreement with DFT calculations. A negative and non-saturating longitudinal magnetoresistance is observed, consistent with a chiral-anomaly contribution from Weyl fermions near the Fermi level (EF). Furthermore, a substantial topological Hall resistivity of 1.6 {\mu}{\Omega} cm robust across a wide temperature range, indicating the possibility of robust chiral spin textures in the thin-film geometry. These combined theoretical and experimental results establish Fe5Si3 as a unique, low-cost, centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl nodal-line material, providing a versatile platform for exploring coupled real and reciprocal space topologies in topological spintronic applications.

Title: Quantized nonlinear transport and its breakdown in Fermi gases with Berry curvature
Authors: Fan Yang, Xingyu Li
Abstract: Quantized transport not only exist in gapped topological states but also in metallic states. Recently, Kane proposed a quantized nonlinear conductance in ballistic metals whose value is determined by the Euler characteristic of the Fermi sea [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 076801 (2022)]. In this paper, we consider two-dimensional noninteracting fermionic systems whose Fermi surface has nonvanishing Berry curvature. We find that the Berry curvature at the Fermi surface does not affect the quantized nonlinear transport for translationally invariant systems. When spatial inhomogeneity is introduced, such quantization breaks down due to the combined effect of Berry curvature and the gradient of local potential. Such breakdown of quantization can be observed in trapped ultracold atoms with topological bands.

Title: Anisotropic and isotropic elasticity and thermal transport in monolayer C$_{24}$ networks from machine-learning molecular dynamics
Authors: Qing Li, Haikuan Dong, Penghua Ying, Zheyong Fan
Abstract: Two-dimensional fullerene networks have recently attracted increasing interest due to their diverse bonding topologies and mechanically robust architectures. In this work, we develop an accurate machine-learned potential NEP-C$_{24}$ for both the quasi-hexagonal phase (qHP) and the quasi-tetragonal phase (qTP) C$_{24}$ monolayers, based on the neuroevolution potential (NEP) framework. Using this NEP-C$_{24}$ model, we systematically investigate the elastic and thermal transport properties. Compared with C$_{60}$ monolayers, both C$_{24}$ phases exhibit markedly enhanced stiffness, arising from the combination of reduced molecular size and increased density of covalent bonds. The qTP C$_{24}$ monolayer shows nearly isotropic elastic properties and thermal conductivities along its two principal axes owing to its four-fold symmetry, whereas the chain-like, misaligned bonding topology of the qHP C$_{24}$ monolayer leads to pronounced in-plane anisotropy. Homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and spectral decomposition analyses reveal that low-frequency ($<5$ THz) acoustic phonons dominate heat transport, with directional variations in phonon group velocity and mean free path governing the anisotropic response in qHP C$_{24}$. Real-space heat flow visualizations further show that, in these fullerene networks, phonon transport is dominated by strong inter-fullerene covalent bonds rather than weak van der Waals interactions. These findings establish a direct link between intermolecular bonding topology and phonon-mediated heat transport, providing guidance for the rational design of fullerene-based two-dimensional materials with tunable mechanical and thermal properties.

Title: Precise computation of universal corner entanglement entropy at 2+1 dimension: From Ising to Gaussian quantum critical points
Authors: Ben Lee-Yeung Ngai, Justin Tim-Lok Chau, Junchen Rong, Yuan Da Liao, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: Computing the subleading logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy (EE) of (2+1)d quantum many-body systems remains a significant challenge, despite its critical role in revealing universal information about quantum states and quantum critical points (QCPs). Capitalizing on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable, we develop a {\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner EE along a parameter trajectory connecting the Ising and Gaussian QCPs; where in the latter case there exists an analytic value to benchmark with. Our approach eliminates the dominant area-law term directly within the QMC sampling, thereby promoting the coveted subleading logarithmic term to the leading contribution. We apply this technique to calculate the EE in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction, tracing a path from the Ising to the Gaussian QCPs and then to the first-order transition. The consistent values obtained for the universal corner EE along the path validate the reliability and precision of our approach for extracting challenging entanglement properties. These results establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.

Title: Altermagnetic boosting of chiral phonons

Abstract: Chirality characterizes the asymmetry between a structure and its mirror image and underlies a wide range of chiral functionalities. In crystallographically chiral materials, phonons with non-zero linear momentum $\textbf{k}$ can acquire a $k$-induced longitudinal magnetization, giving rise to chiral phonons. Helical spin order, with its proper screw-type configuration, breaks all mirror symmetries and therefore carries magnetic chirality. Such helical spins also generate non-relativistic spin splitting for any quasiparticle excitations propagating along the screw axis. To explore the possible connection between chiral phonons and magnetic chirality, we investigated the crystallographically polar and chiral compound (Mn,Ni)$_3$TeO$_6$, which hosts three distinct states: a paramagnetic state, a helical spin state with magnetic chirality, and a collinear spin state without magnetic chirality. We find an approximately tenfold enhancement of chiral-phonon coupling in the helical spin state along the screw axis, compared with both the paramagnetic and collinear spin states. These results identify a new route to amplify chiral phonons through an altermagnetic effect arising from the broken parity-time symmetry in helical spins. %from non-relativistic spin splitting.

Abstract: Producing large-area single-crystalline graphene is key to realizing its full potential in advanced applications, including twistronics. Yet, controlling graphene growth kinetics to avoid grain boundaries or multilayer growth remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate single-crystalline graphene free from multilayer domains via one-step delamination of epitaxial graphene from silicon carbide (SiC). This is enabled by a specific surface reconstruction of 4H-SiC(0001) achieved in our growth conditions. High crystalline quality is confirmed by the observation of the half-integer quantum Hall effect -- the hallmark of monolayer graphene -- in near cm-sized crystals. The scalability of our process, explored with 4''-wafers, represents an advance toward large-scale integration of high-performance graphene applications.

Title: Free Energy and Diffusivity in the Fokker-Planck Theory of Polymer Translocation
Authors: Bhavesh R. Sarode, Harshwardhan H. Katkar
Abstract: We revisit the Fokker-Planck based theory of driven polymer translocation through a narrow nanopore. A bead-spring model of a uniformly charged polyelectrolyte chain translocating through a semi-implicit model of a nanopore embedded in a membrane are used to gain insights into the underlying free energy landscape and kinetics of translocation. The free energy landscape is predicted using metadynamics simulation, an enhanced sampling method. A direct comparison with the theoretical free energy formulation proposed in the literature allows us to introduce a modification related to the entropic contribution in the theory. Additional classical Langevin dynamics simulation runs are performed to obtain the translocation time distribution for polymers of lengths $N$ driven by voltages $V$ through nanopores of radii $r_p$. In agreement with earlier reports, a scaling of the mean translocation time $\langle \tau_\text{LD} \rangle \sim N^\alpha/V$ is observed, with $\alpha \sim 1.40 - 1.48$ depending on the nanopore size. Fitting the mean first passage time given by the Fokker-Planck theory, $\langle \tau_\text{FP}\rangle$,to simulation results helps gain insights into the diffusivity $k_\text{FP}$ used in the theory. We report a scaling of $k_\text{FP}\sim N^\beta$. The $r_p-$dependent values of the exponent $\beta$ significantly deviate from the Rouse theory prediction of $\beta = -1$ for center-of-mass diffusivity of a polymer chain.

Title: Multiterminal Ballistic Josephson Effect in Monocrystalline Gold

Abstract: We report on the realization of a planar, quasi-ballistic Josephson junction array using a Au micron-sized single-crystal. The system exhibits a nonlocal, multiterminal Josephson effect, where the supercurrent between any two superconducting leads is governed by the phase coherence across the entire crystal. Key evidence includes a non-monotonic dependence of the critical current on junction length and magnetic interference patterns with periods corresponding to the shared normal-metal area. Nonlocal transport measurements further confirm that the supercurrent between two electrodes depends on the phase configuration of all the others. Our results, supported by a developed theoretical model, establish a platform for exploring complex superconducting phenomena in multiterminal ballistic systems.

Title: Theory of planar quasi-ballistic Josephson junctions
Authors: G. A. Bobkov, I. V. Bobkova, A. M. Bobkov, K. B. Polevoy, V. S. Stolyarov
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for planar quasi-ballistic Josephson junctions, where multiple superconducting leads are coupled through a large, nearly ballistic normal metal crystal. Our approach, based on quasiclassical Eilenberger equations, accounts for the dominant role of electron reflections from the crystal surfaces or single impurities, a mechanism distinct from both purely ballistic and diffusive limits. We calculate the critical current between superconducting leads for various geometries, examining its dependence on temperature and magnetic field. Crucially, we demonstrate that in multi-terminal setups, the junctions are not independent but form a strongly coupled system. The theory successfully explains key experimental observations from a companion work, including a non-monotonic dependence of the critical current on the interlayer length, providing a foundation for designing and understanding complex multi-terminal Josephson systems.

Title: Flow of a colloidal solution in an orthogonal rheometer
Authors: Krishna Kaushik Yanamundra (1), Chandler C. Benjamin (1), Kumbakonam Ramamani Rajagopal (1) ((1) Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, TX, USA)
Abstract: The flow of a colloidal solution between two parallel disks rotating with the same angular velocity about two non-coincident axes was studied. The problem has been approached from two perspectives, the first wherein the stress is expressed in terms of a power-law of kinematical quantities, and the second wherein we consider a non-standard model where the symmetric part of the velocity gradient is given by a power-law of the stress. For a range of power-law exponents, the class of models are non-invertible. By varying the material and geometric parameters, changes in the flow behaviour at different Reynolds numbers were analysed. We find that pronounced boundary layers develop even at low Reynolds numbers based on the power-law exponents. The new class of stress power-law fluids and fluids that exhibit limiting stress also show the ability to develop boundary layers.

Title: First Passage Resetting Gas
Authors: Marco Biroli, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional gas of $N$ Brownian particles that diffuse independently but are simultaneously reset whenever any of them reaches a fixed threshold located at $L > 0$. For any $N > 2$, the system reaches a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) at long-times with strong long-range correlations. These correlations emerge purely from the dynamics, and not from built-in interactions. Despite being strongly correlated, the NESS has a solvable structure that allows for an exact computation of several physical observables, both global and local. These include the average density profile, the distribution of the position of the $k$-th ordered particles, the distribution of the gap between two consecutive particles and the full counting statistics, i.e., the distribution of the number of particles in a finite interval around the origin.

Title: A Rapid Thermal Chemical Vapor Deposition System for Fast Synthesis of Epitaxial Graphene Under Ambient Pressure

Abstract: Graphene has emerged as a promising material for next-generation electronic and thermal devices owing to its exceptional charge transport and thermal conductivity. However, high-quality samples are predominantly obtained via mechanical exfoliation from graphite crystals, a process that inherently lacks scalability. Despite extensive efforts toward large-area synthesis, cost-effective approaches for producing high-quality, large-area, single-crystalline graphene with fast turnaround time remain limited. Here, we report the design, fabrication, and performance benchmarking of a rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD) system capable of synthesizing epitaxial monolayer graphene under atmospheric pressure. The entire growth process, from sample loading to unloading, is achieved within $25$ minutes with a temperature ramp rate exceeding $23^\circ\mathrm{C}/s$. Growth at atmospheric pressure eliminates the need for vacuum components, thereby reducing both system complexity and operational costs. The structural and electronic quality of epitaxial graphene is comprehensively characterized using Raman spectroscopy, selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and magnetotransport measurements, which reveal signatures of quantum Hall effect in synthesized graphene samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate van der Waals epitaxial growth of palladium (Pd) thin films on graphene transferred to Si/SiO$_{2}$ substrates, establishing its single-crystalline nature over a large area and its potential as a versatile platform for subsequent heteroepitaxial growth.

Title: Characterizing topology at nonzero temperature
Authors: Julia D. Hannukainen, Nigel R. Cooper
Abstract: We compare different methods for characterizing topology at nonzero temperatures, as applied to one-dimensional inversion-symmetric fermionic chains and focusing on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hopping. Whilst the ensemble geometric phase, a mixed-state generalization of the Zak phase remains well defined at nonzero temperature, the modulus of the corresponding expectation value vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, limiting its practical use. To develop a diagnostic that is suitable also for very large systems, we introduce local density operators acting on neighboring sites, which distinguish topological phases by comparing their expectation values. The topological phase is identified from the relative magnitude of these expectation values, which only requires measuring two local expectation values at nonzero temperature, together with one additional nonlocal expectation value when next-nearest-neighbor hopping is included. In addition, we generalize the local chiral marker to mixed Gaussian states, fully determined by its single-particle correlation matrix, with a nonzero purity gap in their effective single-particle Hamiltonian. The presence of a purity gap ensures that the correlation matrix can be adiabatically flattened to an effective projector. Evaluating the chiral marker with respect to the band-flattened correlation matrix yields a real space topological invariant that coincides with the winding number in the zero temperature limit. The ensemble geometric phase, the local density operators, and the local chiral marker, provide complementary schemes to identify and measure topological phases of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain beyond pure states.

Title: Near-flat-band-driven violation of Pauli limit in heavy fermion superconductors
Authors: Yan-Xiao Wang, Yin Zhong
Abstract: Heavy-fermion superconductors often display upper critical fields that exceed the conventional Pauli paramagnetic limit, indicating that strong correlations and hybridized quasiparticle bands play an essential role in the paramagnetic pair-breaking process. Within the two-dimensional Kondo-Heisenberg model, we perform a self-consistent mean-field analysis of spin-singlet s-, extended-s-, and d-wave pairing under Zeeman fields, and compute the critical field Bc, the transition temperature Tc, and the Clogston-Chandrasekhar ratio rCC. We find that rCC increases sharply as the conduction filling approaches half filling. This enhancement arises from the weakly dispersive region of the lower hybridized band, where the strongly reduced Fermi velocity diminishes the normal-state paramagnetic energy and stabilizes superconductivity. At fixed filling, the distinct JH dependences among the three pairing channels reflect the sensitivity of Pauli limiting to both band curvature and the structure of the order parameter. These results provide microscopic evidence that proximity to a near-flat hybridized band offers a robust route to enhanced Pauli-limiting fields in heavy-fermion superconductors.

Title: Dual Role of Nb in Defect-Mediated Strength and Ductility of γ-TiAl Alloys
Authors: Zhiqiang Zhao, Siyao Shuang, Kepeng Ouyang, Maolin Yu, Junping Du, Liangli Chu, Xiaokai Chen, Shigenobu Ogata, Wanlin Guo, Zhuhua Zhang, Yong-Wei Zhang
Abstract: The origin of the superior high-temperature strength of {\gamma}-TiAl with high Nb addition remains highly controversial, largely due to the unclear role of Nb atoms. Using large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations with a self-developed neural network potential,we show that Nb atoms predominantly occupy Ti sites and form short-range order with neighboring Al atoms, but a non-negligible fraction also occupies Al sites (NbAl) and promotes the formation of antisite defects (TiAl). Both the NbAl and TiAl antisites exceptionally reduce stacking fault energies and facilitate deformation twinning, thereby enhancing plasticity. Meanwhile, these substitutional and antisite defects also increase the Peierls stress of both screw and edge dislocations, which hinders dislocation motion to cause pronounced solid-solution strengthening. This work provides mechanistic insights into the dual role of Nb in enhancing both strength and ductility in {\gamma}-TiAl and further offers guidance for defect and composition engineering in advanced alloy systems.

Title: Avalanches in active glasses with finite persistence
Authors: Roland Wiese, Ezequiel Ferrero, Demian Levis
Abstract: We numerically investigate the statistics of avalanches in glassy systems of active particles with finite persistence, with and without an externally applied shear. In departing from the infinite-persistence limit and exploring the interplay of internal activity and external driving, we uncover when and why active and passive systems display similar avalanche statistics and where these analogies fail. We find that power-law distributed stress drops emerge only when activity builds long enough correlations, controlled by the persistence length, with exponents that vary from the purely strain-driven case, to the purely activity-driven case, in a smooth fashion. The local structure and scaling of avalanches of plastic rearrangements remains universal across both limit cases, supporting an interpretation of activity as increasing the typical size of the regions involved in a given avalanche. Our results bridge quasistatic shear strain and finite-persistence active yielding, showing that avalanches driven by self-propulsion retain the characteristic fingerprints of long-range stress propagation.

Title: Dressing composite fermions with artificial intelligence
Authors: Mytraya Gattu
Abstract: Recent variational studies have demonstrated that the strongly correlated ground states of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect can be captured using machine learning approaches starting from no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We introduce a complementary framework that instead starts from Jain's composite-fermion (CF) wavefunctions, which accurately describe FQH states as weakly interacting states of CFs at fillings $\nu = n/(2pn+1)$ in an idealized limit. As we move away from this idealized limit to one more in line with experimental reality, we expect CFs to become dressed much like the electrons of a noninteracting system, which are dressed by neutral excitations as interaction is turned on adiabatically, as in Landau's Fermi-liquid theory. We model this dressing using a Feynman-Cohen-style backflow approach, implemented through symmetry-preserving neural networks-a framework we refer to as CF-Flow. CF-Flow achieves competitive accuracy with substantially greater computational efficiency and scales to systems of $\gtrsim 26$ electrons. At fillings $\nu = 1/3$ and $2/5$, as a function of Landau-level mixing strength, CF-Flow produces ground-state energies with low local-energy variance that are nearly indistinguishable from those obtained using the fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo (fp-DMC) method, even though the latter constrains the wavefunction phase to that of the lowest Landau level-thereby providing insight into why fp-DMC has been successful in giving an accurate quantitative account of several experiments. Finally, the symmetry-preserving architecture of CF-Flow enables access to excited states and computation of the transport gap at $\nu = 1/3$, where we find, unexpectedly, that it decays exponentially toward a finite value in the limit of large Landau-level mixing, suggesting a first-order transition from the FQH liquid to a non-FQH state.

Title: Universal asymptotic solution of the Fokker-Planck equation with time-dependent periodic potentials
Authors: Boxuan Han, Zeyu Rao, Ming Gong
Abstract: Brownian motion, as one of the most fundamental concepts in statistical physics, has everlasting interests in interdisciplinary fields in the past century. Although this motion with static potentials have been widely explored, its physics in time-dependent periodic potentials are far less well understood. Here we generalize this motion to the realm of time-dependent periodic potentials, showing that the asymptotic solution of the probability distribution function (PDF) can have a universal form, that is, a Boltzmann weight multiplied by a Gaussian envelope function. We derive a partial equation for this Boltzmann weight and demonstrate that many different potentials can give the same Boltzmann weight. We first present an exact solvable model to illustrate the validity of our solution. For the periodic potential with a time-dependent tilt potential, we can determine the Boltzmann weight by numerical solving the partial equation. These results are confirmed by solving the Langevin equation numerically. With this idea, we can determine the asymptotic solution of the Fokker-Planck equation, in which the entropy satisfies the thermodynamic law. Our results can have wide applications, including quasi-periodic potentials, two-dimensional potentials and even with models with inertia, which should greatly broaden our perspective of Brownian motion.

Title: Heider balance of a square lattice in an external field
Authors: Zdzisław Burda, Maciej Wołoszyn, Krzysztof Malarz, Krzysztof Kułakowski
Abstract: We discuss the Heider model in the presence of an external social field. This field was introduced to break the symmetry between the probabilities of hostile and friendly relationships. We consider the system in the presence of fluctuations generated by thermal noise and present the results of a comparative study of two-dimensional triangular and square networks with periodic boundary conditions. The results were obtained using three different methods: exact calculations for small systems, Monte Carlo simulations of medium-sized systems, and exact calculations in the thermodynamic limit (corresponding to infinite size) of certain limiting cases for which analytical solutions are possible. In particular, we exploit the recently discovered equivalence between structurally balanced systems and the Ising model to derive an exact form of the edge magnetization susceptibility for systems in Heider equilibrium.

Title: Thermomechanical investigation of silicon wafer dynamics within the melting regime driven by picosecond laser pulses for surface structuring
Authors: Helen Papadaki, Inam Mirza, Nadezhda M. Bulgakova, Evaggelos Kaselouris, Vasilis Dimitriou
Abstract: Laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) on silicon, generated by ultrashort pulsed lasers, provide an efficient means to tailor surface functionality. This work presents a multiphysics finite element study on the thermomechanical dynamics of silicon wafers irradiated by picosecond laser pulses, focusing on the melting regime where thermomechanical and hydrodynamic effects dominate. To illustrate the sequential nature of laser scanning, single-pulse irradiation models are developed as thermomechanical analogues of double-pulse interactions. By positioning the laser focus near reflective boundaries and corners of the target, these models reproduce the stress-wave interference that would occur between successive pulses in scanning. The results show that periodic surface structures originate from mechanical standing wave interference within the molten layer, forming ripples with near-wavelength periodicity. The penetration depth (PD) is identified as a key factor controlling the duration and stability of these ripples: shallow PDs (75-150 nm) yield distinct, persistent patterns, while deeper PDs (app. 2.5 micrometers) lead to extended melting and hydrodynamic smoothing. Simulations of sequential double-pulse irradiation confirm that residual stresses and strains from the first pulse amplify deformation during the second, enhancing ripple amplitude and uniformity. Controlled excitation of mechanical standing waves governed by PD, boundary geometry, and pulse sequencing - thus represents a fundamental mechanism for deterministic LIPSS formation on silicon.

Title: Spin-wave emission with current-controlled frequency by a PMA-based spin-Hall oscillator
Authors: Moritz Bechberger, David Breitbach, Abbas Koujok, Björn Heinz, Carsten Dubs, Abbass Hamadeh, Philipp Pirro
Abstract: Spin-torque and spin-Hall oscillators (SHOs) have emerged as promising candidates for building blocks in neuromorphic computing due to their ability to synchronize mutually, a process that can be mediated by propagating spin waves. We demonstrate a SHO that takes advantage of a low-damping magnetic garnet with dominant perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), namely gallium-substituted yttrium-iron-garnet (Ga:YIG). In-plane magnetized Ga:YIG allows for the operation at a high efficiency level while also enabling resonant spin-wave emission. A nonlinear self-localization of the excitation is avoided by exploiting the positive nonlinear frequency shift, which facilitates a current-controlled frequency of the emitted spin waves. Via micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, we investigate the properties of the local auto-oscillation and its spin-wave emission. Multiple modes are excited and compete internally, with two propagating modes detected up to distances larger than \SI{10}{\micro\meter}. Their frequencies combine to an extended frequency bandwidth of approximately \SI{1.6}{\giga\hertz}. The experimentally observed two-mode system and its transition to a single mode at higher currents are reproduced via micromagnetic simulations, which account for spatial variation of the PMA arising due to the microstructures on Ga:YIG. Our results propose a promising platform for hosting SHOs, interconnected via propagating spin waves with particular relevance to neuromorphic computing.

Title: Carrier localization and dynamics in In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N: the impact of alloying and Si doping
Authors: Ongeziwe Mpatani, Dominik Muth, Anton Krüger, Rajdeep Adhikari, Alberta Bonanni, Marina Gerhard, Hilary Masenda
Abstract: Alloying and doping are crucial for enhancing the electronic and optical properties of semiconductors while simultaneously introducing disorder. This report explores the effects of alloying and Si (0.5 at.\%) doping on In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N thin films that were grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. Post-growth X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that Si doping does not affect the lattice parameters and screw dislocations but significantly increases the edge dislocation density. Temperature-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy shows that Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N exhibits higher photoluminescence intensity, blue-shifted peaks, narrower emission linewidths, and quenching of lower energy sidebands when compared to pristine In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N. The peak energies of the most dominant feature, the donor-bound exciton, for both samples show an $S$-shape behavior indicating the presence of disorder. Although doping improves luminescence, it also introduces deeper localized states. This suggests that impurity-induced disorder outweighs compositional fluctuations, as confirmed by higher disorder parameters and Stokes shifts. Thus, the Si doping leads to increased localization, reducing nonradiative recombination channels while enhancing radiative processes. The deeper states in the doped sample confirm improved carrier confinement, and their saturation leads to early thermalization, thereby lowering the red-blue shift transition from 165 K to about 50 K. Even though the high doping level makes Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N a degenerate system, it exhibits enhanced luminescence properties. These findings shed light on the impact of silicon doping on charge transport in InGaN alloys for optoelectronic applications.

Title: Impact of Electrical Contacts on Transition Metal Dichalcogenides-Based Acoustoelectric and Acousto-Photoelectric Devices
Authors: Benjamin Mayer, Felix M. Ehring, Clemens Strobl, Matthias Weiß, Ursula Wurstbauer, Hubert J. Krenner, Emeline D. S. Nysten
Abstract: We study the impact of electrical contact barriers in hybrid WSe$_2$-LiNbO$_3$-based acoustoelectric and acousto-photoelectric devices using a combination of scanning photocurrent and acousto-electric current spectroscopy. Static scanning photocurrent measurements provide a qualitative measure of the band-bending and spatial distribution of the Schottky barrier between semiconducting WSe$_2$ and gold electrodes whereas the surface acoustic wave-induced acousto-electric current reveals the height of the tunnelling barrier created by the van der Waals gap between the multilayered WSe$_2$ flake and the gold electrodes in addition to the Schottky barrier. The combination of both techniques shows a ten-fold increase in the photocurrent by the acoustic wave. Moreover, the observed spatial redistribution of the current is attributed to the interplay between the contact properties at the source and drain electrodes and the charge carrier dynamics induced by the surface acoustic wave. The ratio of acoustic wavelength to the electrical channel length is found to impact the SAW-induced charge carrier transport. For a channel length shorter than one acoustic wavelength, carriers undergo a seesaw-like motion which changes to charge conveyance for channel lengths comparable or exceeding the acoustic wavelength.

Title: Spin-resolved Mott crossover and entanglement in the half-filled Hubbard model
Authors: Md Fahad Equbal, M. A. H. Ahsan
Abstract: We study interaction-driven crossover from a correlated metallic state to Mott-insulating state on the half-filled 3x3 square cluster using exact diagonalization in the S=1/2 and S=3/2 sectors. Using complementary diagnostics such as order parameters, principal component analysis (PCA) of correlation matrices and quantum geometry, we obtain a unified, data-driven characterization of the crossover. All three diagnostics consistently identify a broad crossover centered in the weak-to-intermediate coupling regime U~2-6; charge gaps open rapidly, double occupancy suppresses, local moments form, entanglement is significantly reduced, PCA concentrates variance into a few dominant modes and the distance matrices reveals rapid wavefunction reorganization. Our multi-pronged approach establishes the Mott crossover as a smooth but well defined reorganization of electronic correlations with pronounced spin-sector dependence in finite systems.

Title: Electric Polarization from Nonpolar Phonons
Authors: Seongjoo Jung, Turan Birol
Abstract: Born effective charge (BEC), a fundamental quantity in lattice dynamics and ferroelectric theory, provides a quantitative measure of linear polarization response to ionic displacements. However, it does not account for higher-order effects, which can play a significant role in certain materials, such as fluorite HfO$_2$. In this letter, we extend the BEC framework by introducing the concept of second-order dynamical charge and mode effective charge. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that specific combinations of nonpolar phonon modes in many oxides can induce substantial second-order polarizations, reaching magnitudes comparable to those of intrinsically polar modes. Through a symmetry-based analysis of the charge density, we elucidate the microscopic origin of these effects, tracing them to variations in bond covalency and local electronic rearrangements. We also demonstrate large second-order mode effective charge in well-studied perovskites such as SrTiO$_3$, highlighting the generality of these phenomena. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism that drives polarization in crystalline solids, offering new insights into the design principles of next-generation ferroelectric, piezoelectric and multifunctional materials.

Title: Resonant states and nuclear dynamics in solid-state systems: the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation
Authors: Woncheol Lee, Mark E. Turiansky, Dominic Waldhör, Byounghak Lee, Tibor Grasser, Chris G. Van de Walle
Abstract: Bond breaking in the presence of highly energetic carriers is central to many important phenomena in physics and chemistry, including radiation damage, hot-carrier degradation, activation of dopant-hydrogen complexes in semiconductors, and photocatalysis. Describing these processes from first principles has remained an elusive goal. Here we introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for the dissociation process, emphasizing the need for a non-adiabatic approach. We benchmark the results for the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissocation, a primary process for hot-carrier degradation. Passivation of Si dangling bonds by hydrogen is vital in all Si devices because it eliminates electrically active mid-gap states; understanding the mechanism for dissociation of these bonds is therefore crucial for device technology. While the need for a non-adiabatic approach has been previously recognized, explicitly obtaining diabatic states for solid-state systems has been an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate how to obtain these states by applying a partitioning scheme to the Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that bond dissociation can occur when electrons temporarily occupy the antibonding states, generating a highly repulsive excited-state potential that causes the hydrogen nuclear wavepacket to shift and propagate rapidly. Based on the Menzel-Gomer-Redhead (MGR) model, we show that after moving on this excited-state potential on femtosecond timescales, a portion of the nuclear wavepacket can continue to propagate even after the system relaxes back to the ground state, allowing us to determine the dissociation probability. Our results provide essential insights into the fundamental processes that drive carrier-induced bond breaking in general, and specifically elucidate hydrogen-related degradation in Si devices.

Title: Scaling of a Mutual-Information Distance in One-dimensional Quantum Spin Chains
Authors: Beau Leighton-Trudel
Abstract: We introduce a geometric scaling relation that characterizes the local scale behavior of correlations using the informational distance $d_E = K_0/\sqrt{I}$, where $I$ is the mutual information. We define a geometric conversion factor, $G \equiv \partial_r d_E$, which quantifies the local scale. We show that $G$ relates directly to $I$ via $G \propto I^{\kappa}$. For systems with power-law correlations $I(r) \sim r^{-X}$, the metric scaling exponent is $\kappa = 1/X - 1/2$. A key consequence is that the geometric scale $G$ is uniform (position-independent) if and only if $\kappa = 0$, which occurs precisely at $X = 2$. This identifies $X = 2$ as the unique condition for a uniform and metric informational distance. We validate this relation using DMRG simulations of the 1D XXZ chain and exact results for the XX model. We demonstrate two falsifiable diagnostics: (i) $G(r)$ is flat in the bulk at criticality ($X \approx 2$) but varies strongly when gapped; (ii) a coordinate-agnostic slope test of $\log G$ versus $\log I$ at the XX benchmark ($X = 2$) yields $\kappa \simeq 0$. This approach provides a coordinate-independent method for identifying scaling regimes that helps to reduce ambiguity from non-universal amplitudes and from the fitting choices in standard power-law analyses, and defines a simple post-processing pipeline that can be applied directly to numerical or experimental mutual-information data.

Title: Nonlocal Josephson diode effect in minimal Kitaev chains
Authors: Jorge Cayao, Masatoshi Sato
Abstract: We study the emergence of the nonlocal Josephson effect in a system composed of three laterally coupled minimal Kitaev chains and exploit it to realize the nonlocal Josephson diode effect. We find that an imbalance between crossed Andreev reflections and electron cotunneling in the middle Kitaev chain gives rise to an asymmetric $2\pi$-periodic phase-dependent Andreev spectrum, controlled by the superconducting phases across the left and right junctions. We then show that the asymmetric Andreev spectrum, formed by hybridized Andreev bound states at the left and right junctions, enables a supercurrent across one junction via the phase difference at the other junction, thereby signaling the nonlocal Josephson effect. Notably, these nonlocal Josephson supercurrents exhibit distinct positive and negative critical currents, demonstrating the realization of the nonlocal Josephson diode effect with highly tunable polarity and efficiencies exceeding $50\%$. The nonlocal Josephson diode effect requires breaking local time-reversal and local charge-conjugation symmetries, with the latter being unique to minimal Kitaev chains. Our results establish minimal Kitaev chains as a highly controllable platform for engineering nonlocal Josephson phenomena.

Title: A Dimensionally Consistent Size-Strain Plot Method for Crystallite Size and Microstrain Estimation
Authors: Anand Pal
Abstract: X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak broadening analysis remains a cornerstone for quantifying crystallite size and lattice microstrain in materials. Among various approaches, the Size Strain Plot (SSP) method is widely employed for its conceptual simplicity and ease of use. However, this study reveals that the equation most commonly applied in SSP analysis is dimensionally inconsistent, a critical flaw that has gone largely unnoticed and replicated across decades of materials research. This pervasive error raises concerns about the validity of a significant body of published microstructural data. By tracing the historical origin of the misformulated equation, we demonstrate how a seemingly minor oversight evolved into a widely accepted standard practice within the field. We then present a dimensionally consistent formulation that restores physical meaning and analytical reliability to the SSP method. The corrected framework re-establishes the SSP approach as a robust and physically valid tool for XRD-based microstructural characterization. \en

Title: First-principles calculations of elasto-optical properties of $R$Te$_3$
Authors: Kuiqing Tang
Abstract: Rare-earth tritellurides ($R$Te$_3$) exhibit complex charge-density-wave (CDW) phases intertwined with lattice symmetry, offering a platform to explore unconventional symmetry breaking in correlated materials. Elasto-optical probing, which detects strain-induced changes in birefringence, provides a non-invasive approach to visualize anisotropy and emergent order in these quasi-two-dimensional systems. However, the magnitude and symmetry of the expected optical response remain poorly quantified, hindering experimental interpretation. Here, we perform first-principles calculations of the elastic, dielectric, and piezo-optical tensors of NdTe$_3$ to establish a quantitative framework for strain-induced optical anisotropy. These results establish a quantitative link between lattice strain and optical response in $R$Te$_3$, providing a predictive framework for probing symmetry-breaking states via elasto-birefringence.

Title: Bi-altermagnetism unveiled by sublattice-specific circular dichroism in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering
Authors: G. Channagowdra, A. Singh, H. Y. Huang, M. Furo, Bin Gao, Pengcheng Dai, C.T. Chen, J. Kunes, A. Fujimori, S-W. Cheong, A. Hariki, D. J. Huang
Abstract: An altermagnet is a recently identified class of magnets that exhibit a zero net magnetic moment but break symmetry under the combined operations of parity and time reversal. It typically consists of two magnetic sites of opposite spins related by rotation within the unit cell. Here, we use circular dichroism (CD) in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to identify a new form of altermagnetism, namely bi-altermagnetism, in the correlated insulator Fe2Mo3O8, which comprises two altermagnetic sublattices: one with alternating quasi-octahedral Fe environments and the other with alternating tetrahedral Fe environments. We experimentally revealed the emergence of CD in an achiral, zero-magnetization system, thereby probing mirror-symmetry breaking associated with altermagnetic order. Notably, the CD appeared at sublattice-specific excitations of the octahedral and tetrahedral sites, indicating symmetry breaking in both altermagnetic sublattices. Calculations based on a model with the bi-altermagnetic order along the c axis successfully reproduce the observed CD. Our findings provide compelling evidence for bi-altermagnetism in Fe2Mo3O8, and showcase the use of RIXS-CD as a probe of magnetic sublattices in systems with zero net magnetization.

Title: Evidence for itinerant electron-local moment interaction in Li-doped $α$-MnTe

Abstract: We use inelastic neutron scattering to study the impact of Li doping on the semiconducting altermagnet $\alpha$-MnTe. Introducing Li results in a spin reorientation from in-plane to out-of-plane and increases the density of itinerant carriers. While the spin waves in Li-doped $\alpha$-MnTe remain largely Heisenberg-like, there is significant spin wave broadening across the entire Brillouin zone, signaling enhanced magnon damping induced by itinerant carriers. By extracting the local dynamic susceptibility and applying the total moment sum rule, we find that both undoped and Li-doped $\alpha$-MnTe exhibit the full expected Mn$^{2+}$ local moment of $\approx5.9~\mu_\mathrm{B}$ with $S=5/2$. These results demonstrate that Li-doped $\alpha$-MnTe hosts robust local-moment magnetism whose interactions are mediated via Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida-type interactions, highlighting the importance of itinerant carriers in magneto-transport and spin dynamic properties of altermagnets.

Title: High-fidelity regimes of resonator-mediated controlled-Z gates between quantum-dot qubits
Authors: Guangzhao Yang, Marek Gluza, Si Yan Koh, Kelvin Onggadinata, Calvin Pei Yu Wong, Kuan Eng Johnson Goh, Bent Weber, Hui Khoon Ng, Teck Seng Koh
Abstract: Semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) qubits coupled via superconducting microwave resonators provide a powerful means of long-range manipulation of the qubits' spin and charge degrees of freedom. Quantum gates can be implemented by parametrically driving the qubits while their transition frequencies are detuned from the resonator frequency. Long-range two-qubit controlled-Z (CZ) gates have been proposed for the DQD spin qubit within the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). Rapid gates demand strong coupling, but RWA breaks down when coupling strengths become significant relative to system frequencies. Therefore, understanding the errors arising from approximations used is critical for high-fidelity operation. Here, we go beyond RWA to study CZ gate fidelity for both DQD spin and charge qubits. We propose a novel parametric drive on the charge qubit that produces smaller errors and show that the fidelity of the CZ gate outperforms its spin counterpart, resulting in a much smaller fidelity loss of $0.05\%$ compared to $0.80\%$ for the spin qubit, and greater robustness against qubit dephasing and photon loss. We find that drive amplitude -- a parameter dropped in RWA -- is critical for optimizing fidelity, with the charge qubit exhibiting better tolerance to drive amplitude variations. Our results demonstrate the necessity of going beyond RWA in understanding how long-range gates can be realized in DQD qubits, with charge qubits offering considerable advantages in high-fidelity operation.

Authors: Kirill Shulga, Shunsuke Nishimura, Pavel A. Volkov, Ryota Hasegawa, Miu Hirano, Takeyuki Tsuji, Takayuki Iwasaki, Mutsuko Hatano, Kento Sasaki, Kensuke Kobayashi
Abstract: We demonstrate the detection and control of individual Abrikosov vortices in superconducting microwave resonators. $\lambda/4$ resonators with a narrowed region near the grounded end acting as a vortex trap were fabricated and studied using microwave transmission spectroscopy at millikelvin temperatures. Sharp stepwise drops in resonance frequency are detected as a function of increasing external magnetic field, attributed to the entry of individual Abrikosov vortices in the narrow region. This interpretation is confirmed by NV center magnetometry revealing discrete vortex entry events on increasing field. Our results establish a method to investigate and manipulate the states of Abrikosov vortices with microwaves.

Authors: Shawan K. Jha, Makoto Tsubota, Pankaj K. Mishra
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the evolution of four vortex configurations, namely, dipole, plasma, cluster, and lattice, using the two-dimensional mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation, focusing on their dynamical decay and approach to the equilibrium. Our analysis reveals that the cluster vortex configuration reaches equilibrium more rapidly than the others, while the dipole, plasma, and lattice configurations exhibit persistent non-equilibrium behavior, tending toward non-thermal fixed points. Specifically, the cluster configuration follows Kolmogorov-like scaling ($\varepsilon^{i}(k)\sim k^{-5/3}$) in the incompressible spectrum, while the other configurations follow Vinen-like scaling ($\varepsilon^{i}(k)\sim k^{-1}$). In the compressible spectrum, the cluster case exhibits a $k$ scaling, indicating full mode equilibration, while for the other configurations, the modes thermalize only above a critical wave number. Additionally, the transfer function for the cluster configuration displays a Gaussian distribution, typical of equilibrium states, while the other configurations exhibit skewed Gaussian or exponential distributions, indicative of their non-equilibrium nature. Finally, the particle number spectra show that the cluster case follows dynamical scaling closer to equilibrium, while the dipole, plasma, and lattice configurations evolve towards non-thermal fixed points. Our findings provide new insights into the dynamics of vortex configurations and their approach to equilibrium or non-equilibrium states, offering guidance for future studies on quantum turbulence and its control.

Abstract: Hybrid heterostructures composed of graphene and perovskite oxides provide a promising platform for exploiting synergetic interfacial functionalities. Conventional fabrication methods of the hybrid heterostructures rely on transferring graphene grown on metallic substrates-- a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to introducing numerous defects. In this study, we present a universal, catalyst-free method for the direct growth of graphene on insulating substrates by employing three different perovskite oxide substrates (SrTiO$_3$, LaAlO$_3$, and (La$_{0.18}$Sr$_{0.82}$)(Al$_{0.59}$Ta$_{0.41}$)O$_3$) using atmospheric chemical vapor deposition. Comprehensive characterization via Raman spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and electron microscopy confirmed the formation of a uniform, continuous monolayer graphene on all substrates. We identified that growth temperature critically governs graphene quality, as excessive active species may lead to secondary nucleation and the formation of multilayer graphene. Notably, all substrates shared the same optimal growth conditions. Low-temperature Raman spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy of the graphene/SrTiO$_3$ hybrid heterostructure revealed cooperative phenomena, including substrate-induced lattice-phonon and electron-phonon coupling. Our work establishes a reproducible, transfer-free fabrication route for graphene/perovskite oxide hybrid heterostructures and provides empirical support for the universal growth of graphene on insulating substrates.

Title: Helical Edge Transport in the ν= 0 Quantum Hall Ferromagnetic State of an Organic Dirac Fermion System
Authors: Toshihito Osada, Mitsuyuki Sato, Takako Konoike, Woun Kang
Abstract: We experimentally confirm the \nu = 0 quantum Hall ferromagnetic (QHF) state, accompanied by helical edge states, in the layered organic Dirac-fermion system \alpha-(ET)2I3 by demonstrating helical edge transport in multilayers. The saturation of interlayer magnetoresistance (MR) in the high-magnetic-field quantum limit does not scale with the sample cross-sectional area and appears when the magnetic field is oriented along the side surface. The in-plane MR exhibits a similar angle dependence, whereas this feature disappears in the Corbino geometry where no edge channels are present. These results are consistent with helical edge transport in the multilayer QHF state. They also rule out the possibility that the observed angle-dependent MR arises from the chiral magnetic effect expected for a 3D Dirac or Weyl semimetal.

Title: Spectral form factor and power spectrum for trapped rotating interacting bosons: An exact diagonalization study
Authors: Mohd Talib, M. A. H. Ahsan
Abstract: We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral form factor and the power spectrum for externally impressed rotating bosons in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap interacting via repulsive Gaussian potential. Our focus is on the spectral correlations arising from the condensate depletion as a result of the formation of quantized vortices and the strong interaction, which leads to chaos in the system. We consider two distinct interaction regimes: moderate, where the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, and strong, where it is comparable. For the non-rotating case, the spectral form factor (SFF) in the moderate interaction regime exhibits a dip-plateau structure characteristic of integrable systems, while in the strong interaction regime it develops a weak ramp, signalling a transition to pseudo-integrable behavior. For the rotating single-vortex state, the SFF in the moderate interaction regime shows the onset of a weak ramp consistent with pseudo-integrability, whereas in the strong interaction regime the ramp becomes significantly more pronounced, indicating strongly chaotic behavior. For the multi-vortex states in the strong interacting regime, the SFF exhibits a clear dip-ramp-plateau structure, indicative of chaotic behavior. The corresponding power spectrum results further corroborate these findings: integrable system exhibits the characteristic $1/f^{\alpha}$ (with $\alpha \approx2$) noise, chaotic system shows the ubiquitous $1/f^{\alpha}$ (with $\alpha \approx 1$) noise, and pseudo-integrable system yields intermediate exponents with $1 < \alpha < 2$.

Title: Screened topological plasmons in graphene plasmonic crystals
Authors: André Octávio Soares, Christos Tserkezis, N. M. R. Peres
Abstract: We study topological effects in an one-dimensional plasmonic crystal formed by the screened acoustic plasmons emerging in a periodically modulated graphene sheet, placed on top of a metallic substrate. To this end, we develop the theory of quantization of screened plasmons, as appropriate for lossless graphene described by a Drude conductivity. By analyzing the resulting band structure, we show that the crystal sustains nontrivial topological bands, with quantized geometric phase. We further show that in a finite, open system, edge states appear within the band gap, which undergo a topological phase transition and merge with bulk states as the modulation increases. Our work provides a robust theoretical framework for the study of band structure and topology of layered media, and extends the possibilities for engineering two-dimensional materials with external modulation.

Title: Stacking-Induced Large-Chern-Number Quantum Anomalous Hall Phases
Authors: H. Minh Lam, V. Nam Do
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phases hosted by two atomically thin hexagonal lattices and demonstrate the emergence of topological phases with large Chern numbers. Interlayer coupling between two graphene-like lattices produces band crossings, while relative sliding preserves gapless Dirac points located at generic, low-symmetry $\mathbf{k}$ points. The introduction of Haldane-type complex next-nearest-neighbor hoppings gaps these Dirac points, breaks time-reversal symmetry, and generates a sequence of quantum anomalous Hall phases. Depending on the phase angles $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ associated with the two layers, the system exhibits QAH states with Chern numbers $|C|>2$. The nontrivial bulk topology is verified by the presence of the corresponding number of chiral edge modes in ribbon geometries. These high-Chern-number phases originate from the enhanced twisting of the valence-band manifold induced by interlayer stacking.

Title: Electric-field driven flat bands in the distorted sawtooth chain via the Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky mechanism
Authors: Vadim Ohanyan, Lusik Amiraghyan, Michael Sekania, Marcus Kollar
Abstract: We investigate flat magnonic bands in a generalized sawtooth-chain model in which three sets of exchange parameters (symmetric Heisenberg exchange, axial Ising anisotropy, and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) exchange) are assigned independently to each side of the triangular plaquette. If the effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction parameters are generated via the Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky (KNB) mechanism of magnetoelectricity, they become explicit functions of the electric-field magnitude and direction, as well as of the lattice geometry, which in the present casen is characterized by two bond angles. We focus on the situation in which these two angles are unequal, corresponding to a distortion of the triangular plaquette. Several electric-field induced flat-band scenarios in the distorted sawtooth chain are analyzed, and expressions are derived for the electric-field strength required to drive the one-magnon excitations into a flat-band regime when the field is aligned along the lattice bonds. The saturation field and its dependence on the distortion angle are also examined. Finally, we establish a mapping between the flat-band solutions for a general DM interaction and its specific KNB-induced form. \\~ \emph{This article is dedicated to the memory of Johannes Richter.}

Title: Field-Tunable Quantum Metric in Few-Layer Phosphorene
Authors: Md Afsar Reja, Arka Bandyopadhyay, Awadhesh Narayan
Abstract: The quantum metric -- which quantifies the distance between quantum states -- is a fundamental component of the quantum geometric tensor, playing a crucial role in a wide range of physical phenomena. Its direct detection and control remains a challenge, requiring suitable material candidates. In this work, we present the emergence of a tunable quantum metric in a versatile two-dimensional material platform, namely, few-layer phosphorene. Using ab-initio-derived models, we show how electric fields can be used to substantially enhance the quantum metric as well as the associated quantum weight. Furthermore, we present a layer-dependent evolution of the quantum metric and its interplay with the electric field in this material. Our results establish few-layer phosphorene as a promising platform for exploring control over the quantum metric and the resulting metric responses in real materials.

Title: Exchange-Correlation Functionals in 2D Materials: Applications, Challenges, and Limitations
Authors: Ahsan Javed, Mahvish Shaheen, Muhammad Shahbaz, M. Sufyan Ramzan, Rafi Ullah, Wei Jiang
Abstract: The rapid development of two-dimensional (2D) materials has reshaped modern nanoscience, offering properties that differ fundamentally from their bulk counterparts. As experimental discovery accelerates, the need for reliable computational techniques has become increas- ingly important. Within the framework of density functional theory, this review explores the critical role of exchange-correlation functionals in predicting key material properties such as structural, optoelectronic, magnetic, and thermal. We examine the challenges posed by quantum confinement, anisotropic screening, and van der Waals interactions, which conventional functionals often fail to describe. Advanced approaches, including meta-GGA, hybrid functionals, and many-body perturbation theory (e.g., GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation), are assessed for their improved accuracy in capturing electronic structure and excitonic effects. We further discuss the non-universality of functionals across different 2D material families and the emerging role of machine learning to enhance computational efficiency. Finally, the review outlines current limitations and emerging strategies, providing a roadmap for advancing exchange-correlation functionals and beyond, to enable the practical design and application of 2D materials.

Title: A mean-field theory of effective normal modes in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou model
Authors: Antonio Ponno, Giacomo Gradenigo, Marco Baldovin, Angelo Vulpiani
Abstract: We present a non-perturbative, mean-field theory for the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou model with quartic interaction, capturing the quasiperiodic features shown by the system at all energies in the thermodynamic limit. Starting from the true Hamiltonian $H$ of the system with $N$ degrees of freedom, we introduce a mean-field Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$ such that the difference $h_N=(H-\mathcal{H})/N$, considered as a random variable with respect to the Gibbs measure, tends to zero as $N\to\infty$, in probabilistic sense. The dynamics of the mean-field Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$ consists of $N$ independent oscillation modes with renormalized frequencies $\Omega_k = \omega_k\sqrt{1+\gamma(\varepsilon)}$, $\omega_k$ being the frequency of the $k$-th normal mode of the linearized system, whereas $\gamma(\varepsilon)$ is an explicit function of the specific energy $\varepsilon$ of the system. Analytical predictions drawn from the effective Langevin equations ruling the dynamics of such oscillation modes are successfully compared with the numerical data from the original Hamiltonian dynamics. Such a simple decomposition of the true dynamics into $N$ effective normal modes holds at all energy scales, i.e. from the quasi-integrable regime to the strongly chaotic one.

Title: Canonical Distribution of the Occupancy Numbers of Bosonic Systems
Authors: Arnaldo Spalvieri
Abstract: The paper works out the canonical probability distribution of the occupancy numbers of a bosonic system and shows that canonical typicality applies to the canonical density operator of the occupancy numbers. The result is that, if, as it is today standard, the canonical system's mixed state is obtained by tracing out the environment from any typical pure state of the universe, then asymptotically the canonical probability distribution of system's occupancy numbers tends in probability to the multinomial distribution. The paper also shows that the currently accepted probability distribution of the occupancy numbers of a system with fixed number of particles is not compatible with the commonly accepted notion of canonical system.

Title: Charge state equilibration of nitrogen-vacancy center ensembles in diamond: The role of electron tunneling
Authors: Audrius Alkauskas, Chris G. Van de Walle, Lukas Razinkovas, Ronald Ulbricht
Abstract: The charge state stability of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers critically affects their application as quantum sensors and qubits. Understanding charge state conversion and equilibration is critical not only for NV centers in diamond but also for defects and impurities in wide-bandgap materials in general. The mechanisms by which these centers change charge state upon optical or electronic excitation without the presence of mobile carriers remain unclear, potentially affecting the performance of applications ranging from phosphors to power electronics. Here, we elucidate this issue for the case of photoionization of NV center ensembles. Using pump-probe spectroscopy, we ionize negatively charged NV centers and monitor the recovery of $\NVm$ on timescales of up to several seconds. We find that the recovery rate depends strongly on the concentration of surrounding nitrogen donors. Remarkably, the equilibration dynamics exhibit no discernible dependence on temperature, ruling out thermally activated processes. The multiphonon-assisted electron tunneling model, supported by density-functional calculations, explains the measurements and identifies tunneling as the equilibration mechanism.

Title: Observation of hidden altermagnetism in Cs$_{1-δ}$V$_2$Te$_2$O
Authors: Guowei Yang, Ruihan Chen, Changchao Liu, Jing Li, Ze Pan, Liwei Deng, Naifu Zheng, Yu Tang, Hao Zheng, Weifan Zhu, Yifu Xu, Xin Ma, Xiaoping Wang, Shengtao Cui, Zhe Sun, Zhengtai Liu, Mao Ye, Chao Cao, Ming Shi, Lunhui Hu, Qihang Liu, Shan Qiao, Guanghan Cao, Yu Song, Yang Liu
Abstract: Altermagnets are characterized by anisotropic band/spin splittings in momentum space, dictated by their spin-space group symmetries. However, the real-space modulations of altermagnetism are often neglected and have not been explored experimentally. Here we combine neutron diffraction, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), spin-resolved ARPES and density functional theory to demonstrate that Cs$_{1-\delta}$V$_2$Te$_2$O realizes a spatially modulated form of altermagnetism, i.e., hidden altermagnetism. Such a state in Cs$_{1-\delta}$V$_2$Te$_2$O results from its G-type antiferromagnetism and two-dimensional electronic states, allowing for the development of spatially alternating altermagnetic layers, whose local spin polarizations are directly verified by spin-resolved ARPES measurements. Our experimental discovery of hidden altermagnetism broadens the scope of unconventional magnetism and opens routes to exploring emergent phenomena from real-space modulations of altermagnetic order.

Title: Crystalyse: a multi-tool agent for materials design
Authors: Ryan Nduma, Hyunsoo Park, Aron Walsh
Abstract: We present Crystalyse, an open, provenance-enforced scientific agent for computational materials design of inorganic crystals that orchestrates tools for compositional screening, crystal structure generation, and machine-learning force-field evaluation. Crystalyse offers three operating modes to trade exploration speed against validation depth: creative (rapid query), adaptive (context-aware routing) and rigorous (comprehensive checks). We release the underlying source code and evaluation scripts to enable plug-and-play use and development. In demonstrations on quaternary oxide exploration, sodium-ion cathode design, and lead-free indoor photovoltaic candidate generation, the agent integrates chemical compound generation with fast stability and property filters. Under adversarial testing, provenance enforcement eliminated material-property hallucinations (a broad adversarial suite pass rate reached 86% from a 57% baseline). Crystalyse provides an agentic artificial intelligence system that can complement existing materials design pipelines, assisting in hypothesis generation while preserving transparency and reproducibility.

Title: Magnetic clusters in the paramagnetic phase of a high-temperature ferromagnetic metal-organic framework
Authors: Giacomo Prando, Benjamin Costarella, Matthew S. Dickson, Ryan A. Murphy, Jesse G. Park, Gianrico Lamura, Giuseppe Allodi, Cristian Aloisi, Aëto Apaix, Maria Cristina Mozzati, T. David Harris, Jeffrey R. Long, Pietro Carretta
Abstract: Owing to their exceptional chemical and electronic tunability, metal-organic frameworks can be designed to develop magnetic ground states making a range of applications feasible, from magnetic gas separation to the implementation of lightweight, rare-earth free permanent magnets. However, the typically weak exchange interactions mediated by the diamagnetic organic ligands result in ordering temperatures confined to the cryogenic limit. The itinerant magnetic ground state realized in the chromium-based framework Cr(tri)$_{2}$(CF$_{3}$SO$_{3}$)$_{0.33}$ (Htri, $1H$-$1$,$2$,$3$-triazole) is a remarkable exception to this trend, showing a robust ferromagnetic behavior almost at ambient conditions. Here, we use dc SQUID magnetometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and ferromagnetic resonance to study the magnetic state realized in this material. We highlight several thermally-activated relaxation mechanisms for the nuclear magnetization due to the tendency of electrons towards localization at low temperatures as well as the rotational dynamics of the charge-balancing triflate ions confined within the pores. Most interestingly, we report the development within the paramagnetic regime of mesoscopic magnetic correlated clusters whose slow dynamics in the MHz range are tracked by the nuclear moments, in agreement with the highly unconventional nature of the magnetic transition detected by dc SQUID magnetometry. We discuss the similarity between the clustered phase in the paramagnetic phase and the magnetoelectronic phase segregation leading to colossal magnetoresistance in manganites and cobaltites. These results demonstrate that high-temperature magnetic metal-organic frameworks can serve as a versatile platform for exploring correlated electron phenomena in low-density, chemically tunable materials.

Title: Second-Order Jahn-Teller Distortions and Dynamic Lattice Polarizability as the Origin of Broadband Emission in Bi3+-Doped Cs2SnCl6
Authors: Shruti Prasad, Pabitra Kumar Nayak, Dibyajyoti Ghosh
Abstract: Lead-free vacancy-ordered perovskites (VOHPs) such as Cs2SnCl6 have emerged as promising materials for optoelectronic applications but typically suffer from wide band gaps and low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY). In this work, the electronic origins of broadband blue emission in Bi3+-doped Cs2SnCl6 are elucidated by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The study systematically explores the spatial configurations of Bi3+ dopants and Cl- vacancies, assessing their impact on structural and electronic properties. Results demonstrate that the formation of square pyramidal BiCl5(2-) units serves as efficient exciton traps, fundamentally enabling strong luminescence in an otherwise non-emitting host. The Bi3+ 6s2 lone pair in an asymmetric coordination environment drives second-order Jahn-Teller distortions, creating a highly polarizable local lattice. This softness, in contrast to the rigid SnCl6(2-) framework, produces heterogeneous distributions of bond lengths, bond angles, and band edges around dopant sites. Defect-induced states strongly localize charge carriers, while coupling to vibrational modes at 300 K dynamically broadens the band edges, accounting for the large Stokes shift and broadband photoluminescence. These results establish lone-pair-driven Jahn-Teller distortions and lattice heterogeneity as key design principles for efficient luminescence in lead-free perovskites.

Title: Adaptation to time-varying environments in a reaction-diffusion model
Authors: Olivier Rivoire, Guy Bunin
Abstract: We present a spatially-extended system of chemical reactions exhibiting adaptation to time-dependent influxes of reactants. Here adaptation is defined as improved reproductive success, namely the ability of one of the many locally stable states available to the system to expand in space at the expense of other states. We find that adaptation can arise simply by environmental exposure to sequences of varying influxes. This adaptation is specific to the temporal sequence yet flexible enough to generalize to related sequences. It is enhanced through repeated exposure to the same environmental sequence, representing a form of learning, and through spatial interactions, enabling natural selection to act and representing a form of collective learning. Finally, adaptation benefits from a nearby adapted state, representing a form of teacher-guided learning. By combining environmental drives and reproduction within a stochastic reaction-diffusion dynamics framework, our model lays a foundation for a theory of adaptation grounded in physical principles.

Title: Trainable amorphous matter: tuning yielding by mechanical annealing
Authors: Maitri Mandal, Pappu Acharya, Rituparno Mandal, Sayantan Majumdar
Abstract: Living organisms can demonstrate highly adaptable and sophisticated responses using memory resulting from repeated exposure to external conditions or training. However, realizing similar adaptability in mechanical responses in inanimate, physical materials presents an outstanding challenge in several fields, including soft matter, materials science, and in the domain of soft robotics, to name a few. Our study focuses on disordered solids, which are model systems that resemble granular matter, foam and other disordered, soft solids. Here, combining bulk rheology, in-situ optical imaging, and numerical simulations, we demonstrate how training via cyclic shear can encode memories that tune the yield point in a unique way and over unprecedented ranges. Our study reveals that such tunability is intricately linked to the plasticity, non-affine deformations, and formation of shear bands. Remarkably, our numerical simulations illustrate that systems with identical internal energies, prepared via different protocols (mechanical or thermal), can display markedly different rheological responses, indicating that energy alone does not determine mechanical behavior. Moreover, while the yield strain increases with training amplitude, the material simultaneously softens, contrasting with the thermal case where both quantities increase monotonically with increasing annealing. Our results open up possibilities for memory-induced tuning of mechanical response in trainable amorphous matter, independently or in combination with thermal annealing, far beyond the material--feature space achievable via the latter alone.

Title: On The Finetuning of MLIPs Through the Lens of Iterated Maps With BPTT
Authors: Evan Dramko, Yizhi Zhu, Aleksandar Krivokapic, Geoffroy Hautier, Thomas Reps, Christopher Jermaine, Anastasios Kyrillidis
Abstract: Vital to the creation of advanced materials is performing structural relaxations. Traditional approaches built on physics-derived first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, motivating the creation of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Traditional approaches to training MLIPs for structural relaxations involves training models to faithfully reproduce first-principles computed forces. We propose a fine-tuning method to be used on a pretrained MLIP in which we create a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes the predicted final structures directly. Trajectories are unrolled and gradients are tracked through the entire relaxation. We show that this method achieves substantial performance gains when applied to pretrained models, leading to a nearly $50\%$ reduction in test error across the sample datasets. Interestingly, we show the process is robust to substantial variation in the relaxation setup, achieving negligibly different results across varied hyperparameter and procedural modifications. Experimental results indicate this is due to a ``preference'' of BPTT to modify the MLIP rather than the other trainable parameters. Of particular interest to practitioners is that this approach lowers the data requirements for producing an effective domain-specific MLIP, addressing a common bottleneck in practical deployment.

Title: First-Principles Investigation of X2NiH6 (X = Ca, Sr, Ba) Hydrides for Hydrogen Storage Applications
Authors: K. Aafi, Z. El Fatouaki, A. Jabar, A. Tahiri, M. Idiri
Abstract: First-principles DFT calculations on the hydrides Ca2NiH6, Sr2NiH6, and Ba2NiH6 reveal key thermodynamic properties. These compounds exhibit increasing entropy and heat capacity with temperature, and are thermodynamically stable at elevated temperatures due to negative free energies. The kinetics of hydrogen storage is influenced by entropy changes during hydrogen adsorption and desorption. Optically, Ba2NiH6 shows a high refractive index at low energies. Mechanical assessments indicate Sr2NiH6 is incompressible with moderate malleability, Ca2NiH6 has the highest resistance to deformation, while Ba2NiH6 is most compressible. Formation energies and hydrogen storage capacities (4.005 wt% for Ca2NiH6, 2.548 wt% for Sr2NiH6, and 1.750 wt% for Ba2NiH6) highlight Ca2NiH6 as the most promising candidate for hydrogen storage technology.

Title: Building Trustworthy AI for Materials Discovery: From Autonomous Laboratories to Z-scores
Authors: Benhour Amirian, Ashley S. Dale, Sergei Kalinin, Jason Hattrick-Simpers
Abstract: Accelerated material discovery increasingly relies on artificial intelligence and machine learning, collectively termed "AI/ML". A key challenge in using AI is ensuring that human scientists trust the models are valid and reliable. Accordingly, we define a trustworthy AI framework GIFTERS for materials science and discovery to evaluate whether reported machine learning methods are generalizable, interpretable, fair, transparent, explainable, robust, and stable. Through a critical literature review, we highlight that these are the trustworthiness principles most valued by the materials discovery community. However, we also find that comprehensive approaches to trustworthiness are rarely reported; this is quantified by a median GIFTERS score of 5/7. We observe that Bayesian studies frequently omit fair data practices, while non-Bayesian studies most frequently omit interpretability. Finally, we identify approaches for improving trustworthiness methods in artificial intelligence and machine learning for materials science by considering work accomplished in other scientific disciplines such as healthcare, climate science, and natural language processing with an emphasis on methods that may transfer to materials discovery experiments. By combining these observations, we highlight the necessity of human-in-the-loop, and integrated approaches to bridge the gap between trustworthiness and uncertainty quantification for future directions of materials science research. This ensures that AI/ML methods not only accelerate discovery, but also meet ethical and scientific norms established by the materials discovery community. This work provides a road map for developing trustworthy artificial intelligence systems that will accurately and confidently enable material discovery.

Title: Aging-driven in situ polymerization of FEC additive boosts the calendar-life of silicon anodes via surface passivation enhancement
Authors: Sattajit Barua, Rownak J. Mou, Koffi P. C. Yao
Abstract: The role of additives such as FEC in extending the calendar life of silicon anodes beyond the cycling benefits is still not fully understood. Herein, the calendar life of high-loading Si (80 wt%) using baseline 1.2 M LiPF6 in EC-EMC electrolyte versus adding 10 wt% FEC is investigated over months. Over 8 days of aging, FEC leads to a 13-fold reduction in irreversible capacity loss in Si-LiFePO4 full cells. Cells without FEC are projected to fall below 80% of their initial capacity within approx. 22 days versus approx. 279 days with FEC. Symmetric Si-Si cells from harvested electrodes show greater increase in interphase resistance without FEC, whereby an increase of 10.81 Ohms is measured for 0 wt% FEC vs. only 3.37 Ohms for 10 wt% FEC over 2 months. Power law modeling of this long-term interphase resistance finds mixed transport-reaction growth behavior in FEC-free cells, suggesting significant dissolution, whereas cells with 10 wt% FEC added display a diffusion-controlled impedance growth behavior, suggesting a robust surface passivation film. Post-mortem FTIR and XPS confirm polycarbonate enrichment of the SEI, which was discovered to predominantly emerge from FEC self-polymerization during the idle aging. When the Si electrodes aged with and without FEC are harvested and reassembled into full cells with the same electrolytes used at aging, the first-cycle coulombic efficiency is 71% for 0 wt% FEC versus 97% for 10 wt% FEC. Subsequent cycling maintains over 99.7% CE with 10 wt% FEC, surpassing the pre-aging CE of 98.8%. This elevated CE indicates better passivation provided by the polymer fragments formed during aging compared to electrochemically formed SEI where no strong polymer FTIR signal is found. The self-polymerization during idle aging with additives such as FEC is therefore an opportune in situ mechanism to further engineer in extending the life of Si-based batteries.

Title: Translational diffusion coefficients of membrane protein aggregates in free and supported lipid membranes
Authors: Yannick A. D. Omar
Abstract: There is increasing evidence that numerous membrane proteins can assemble into aggregates that modulate their function and affect many cellular processes such as signal transduction and endocytosis. Here, we present a theoretical description of the instantaneous translational diffusion coefficients of transmembrane protein aggregates on free and supported lipid membranes using Kirkwood-Riseman theory. We find that hydrodynamic interactions within protein aggregates must be accounted for, as neglecting them yields several times lower diffusion coefficients. By deriving hydrodynamic radii for free and supported lipid membranes, we identify effective length scales that accurately characterize aggregate diffusivities in the presence of hydrodynamic interactions. These findings motivate the approximation of an aggregate by its outline and a random particle distribution inside it. We show that this approach provides a practical method to accurately determine aggregate diffusion coefficients when the particle locations cannot be resolved. The results presented in this article have immediate implications for the formation and function of membrane protein aggregates.

Title: Dynamics of superconducting pairs in the two-dimensional Hubbard model
Authors: G. Sordi, E. M. O'Callaghan, C. Walsh, M. Charlebois, P. Sémon, A.-M. S. Tremblay
Abstract: The frequency structure of the superconducting correlations in cuprates gives insights on the pairing mechanism. Here we present an exhaustive study of this problem in the two-dimensional Hubbard model with cellular dynamical mean-field theory. To this end, we systematically quantify the dependence on doping and interaction strength of the superconducting gap, of the frequency scales where pairing occurs, and of their relative contribution to pairing. We find pair-forming alternating with pair-breaking processes as a function of frequency, providing new evidence that pairing can arise in principle from both low- and high-frequency processes. However, we find that the high-frequency pair-forming processes are outweighed by pair-breaking ones. Hence, the net contribution to pairing comes only from the low-frequency pair-forming processes, a result that underscores their key role in the pairing mechanism.

Title: Single Color Center Spin Coherence revealed in Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance of an Ensemble of Silicon Vacancies in SiC
Authors: David A. Fehr, Hannes Kraus, Corey J. Cochrane, Michael E. Flatté
Abstract: We present a quantitative theory for simulating optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) measurements of optically-active spin centers using steady-state Lindblad equations. We apply the theory to an experimental ODMR spectrum associated with the negatively-charged silicon vacancy V2 center in 6H-SiC, showing that spin Hamiltonian parameters, optical transition rates, and even coherence times may be extracted, with values consistent with recent literature. Notably the $T_2$ spin coherence time is measurable, not just the $T_2^*$ dephasing time. Furthermore, we simulate the ODMR spectra of a V2 center in isotopically-purified 6H-SiC, and predict an order-of-magnitude narrowing of some, but not all spectral lines compared with natural abundance samples.

Abstract: High temperature superconductors, especially YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO), are considered a key enabling technology towards a clean energy future. Hole doping in YBCO is a prerequisite for the emergence of its unchallenged superconducting properties. Up to now, research was focused on the under- and optimally doped region, due to practical limitations in reaching the overdoped state, despite being highly interesting from fundamental and applied aspects as competing orders vanish and critical current densities are expected to peak. Here, we deploy for the first time an electrochemical method to access the mostly uncharted overdoped region. We demonstrate precise control over the bulk oxygen concentration in YBCO thin films across the full off-stoichiometry window (0$\le{\delta}\le$1) using electrochemical oxidation combined with in situ XRD and electrical measurements. Resulting high doping states and critical current densities are confirmed using a multi modal approach, including x-ray diffraction, electrical, Hall and magnetic characterization. Thus, this work opens a promising pathway based on electrochemical oxidation towards electronically clean, oxygen overdoped cuprate superconductors and therefore will assist to further push the critical current density to its intrinsic limit.

Title: Spatial structure and magnetism of a spin-orbit entangled spin-1 coherent spin center: the manganese neutral acceptor in a III-V semiconductor
Authors: Julian Zanon, Michael E. Flatté
Abstract: A Mn dopant in a III-V semiconductor produces a highly-entangled, coherent triplet ground state not fully captured by single-determinant theories of electron structure. We directly construct an analytic form for its ground-state wavefunction, finding surprising spin-charge correlations not revealed by semiclassical calculations. Spin-correlated circulating currents associated with the dopant yield remarkably large magnetic fringe fields of $\sim$1$\,\mu$T at distances of $\sim 10$~nm from Mn in GaAs, potentially detectable by NV-diamond magnetometry while the dopant spin coherently precesses.

Title: Role of Quantum Geometry in the Competition between Higgs Mode and Quasiparticles in Third-Harmonic Generation of Superconductors
Authors: Chang-geun Oh, Haruki Watanabe, Naoto Tsuji
Abstract: Collective modes in superconductors, such as the Higgs mode, offer deep insights into the nature of condensates. Third-harmonic generation (THG) is a primary tool for probing the Higgs mode, but its signal competes with that of quasiparticle excitations depending on impurity scattering rates. In particular, in the clean regime the standard BCS theory generally predicts the dominance of quasiparticle contributions. Here, we propose and demonstrate that the quantum geometry of electronic bands can be a key mechanism governing this competition. By developing a formalism that explicitly incorporates the quantum metric, and applying it to a tunable model of a dispersive-band superconductor, we show that the quantum metric can dramatically amplify the nonlinear light-Higgs coupling by several orders of magnitude. Our results establish that a large quantum metric can cause the Higgs mode to dominate the THG response, resolving the puzzle of Higgs and quasiparticle competition in the clean regime and identifying band geometry as a crucial ingredient for designing and understanding the nonlinear response of superconductors.

Title: Microscopic origin of the spin-splitting in altermagnets
Authors: Suyoung Lee, Minjae Kim, Changyoung Kim
Abstract: Altermagnets, characterized by spin-split bands without net magnetization, have recently emerged as a promising platform for spintronics. However, their microscopic mechanisms remain elusive, often relying on abstract group theory. In this work, we present an intuitive and pedagogical framework to understand the origin of spin splitting in altermagnets. We identify two essential ingredients: (1) alternating spin-polarized wavefunction localization on sublattices, and (2) broken translational symmetry caused by distortions in non-magnetic ion cages. We discuss a minimal model Hamiltonian based on an atomic exchange-driven spin splitting and anisotropic hopping that captures these effects and reproduces the hallmark features of altermagnetic band structures, including nodal spin degeneracies and large spin splittings. Our model is further validated by ab initio calculations on MnF2. By demystifying the microscopic origins of altermagnetism, our work bridges symmetry analysis and material realizations, shedding light on practical designs of altermagnetic spintronic devices.

Title: Violation of the method of images in non-Markovian processes and its connection to stochastic thermodynamics
Authors: Takuya Saito, Yuta Sakamoto, Takahiro Sakaue
Abstract: We discuss a failure of the wide-spread method of images solution to describe the time evolution of probability distribution in diffusive processes with memory. For a path that touches a target during stochastic evolution, we define its conjugate twin of reflected path, and show that their path probability ratio obeys a relation analogous to the fluctuation theorem. With a key quantity properly identified as the heat, the resultant thermodynamic interpretation of the processes provides a quantitative basis as well as an intuitive physical picture on how and why the method of images breaks down for non-Markovian processes.

Title: Competing Lattice and Defect Dynamics Govern Terahertz-Induced Ferroelectricity in Quantum Paraelectric SrTiO$_3$
Authors: L. Cheng, K. Hu, S. Yang, Yan Liang, Jiandi Zhang, J. Qi
Abstract: Intense terahertz (THz) pulses induce transient inversion-symmetry breaking in quantum paraelectric SrTiO$_3$, yet the underlying mechanism remains controversial. Using fields up to $\sim$1.1 MV/cm, we reveal spatially inhomogeneous THz-field-induced second harmonic generation (TFISH) governed by competing lattice and defect dynamics. Short-lived coherent antiferrodistortive (AFD) modes suppress dipole correlations within $\sim$5 ps, while heavily damped soft/AFD modes and a defect-induced low-frequency mode ($\sim$0.1-0.3 THz) jointly prevent long-range ferroelectric coherence in oxygen-vacancy-rich regions. Collective modes manifested by oscillatory TFISH components exhibit softening followed by hardening below a critical temperature $T^*\simeq$28 K, confirming transient ferroelectric order where defects are sparse. These results reconcile conflicting interpretations, establish defect-mediated competition as a central regulator of light-induced ferroelectricity, and open routes to ultrafast control of quantum materials.

Title: Inductive van der Waals Force between Two Quantum Loops
Authors: Kicheon Kang
Abstract: We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.

Title: Generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism accompanied by flavor-selective Mott states in an SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard model
Authors: Juntaro Fujii, Kazuki Yamamoto, Akihisa Koga
Abstract: We study the ferromagnetic instability in an SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard model on the hypercubic lattice. Combining dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find that, in the strong-coupling regime at low temperatures, ferromagnetically ordered (FM) states develop away from the commensurate fillings. In the particle-doped SU($3$) system near one-third filling, the FM state is accompanied by a spontaneous flavor-selective Mott state, where two of the three flavors are Mott insulating while the remaining flavor is metallic. Since particles in the metallic flavor can almost freely move on the lattice without correlation effects, the ordered state is stabilized by the kinetic-energy gain of the doped particles. This is similar to the generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism discussed in the one-hole-doped system at one-third filling. In the SU($4$) case, we find that six distinct types of FM states appear as the particle density varies. The results uncover the nature of the FM state in the SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard systems and highlight the rich magnetic behavior enabled by enlarged internal symmetries.

Title: Topological superconductivity and superconducting diode effect mediated via unconventional magnet and Ising spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Amartya Pal, Debashish Mondal, Tanay Nag, Arijit Saha
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework in which a one-dimensional (1D) tight-binding model incorporating unconventional magnetic order together with Rashba and Ising spin-orbit couplings are considered to realize two key phenomena in condensed matter systems: topological superconductivity and the superconducting diode effect (SDE). We first elucidate the underlying band topology of the normal-state Hamiltonian and subsequently introduce an on-site attractive Hubbard interaction. Performing a a self-consistent mean-field analysis, we establish superconducting order parameters in both the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing channels. Intriguingly, both pairing states can support topological superconductivity, characterized by a nontrivial winding number, and lead to the emergence of four zero-energy Majorana modes localized at the ends of the 1D chain. The FFLO state further gives rise to an intrinsic field-free SDE, manifested as a nonreciprocal supercurrent and quantified by the diode efficiency $\eta$. Notably, our model yields a large diode efficiency $\eta \sim 65\%$, highlighting its potential for realising topological superconductivity and highly efficient superconducting devices.

Title: Extraordinary cation-replace-cation antisite defect predominate in Bi2SeO5
Authors: Chen-Min Dai, Feifan Bian, Yafeng Zhang, Jiaqi Chen, Zenghua Cai, Menglin Huang, Chunlan Ma
Abstract: As a newly identified single-crystalline van der Waals dielectric with a high dielectric constant, Bi2SeO5 plays a pivotal role in advancing 2D electronic devices. In this work, we systematically investigate the defect properties of Bi2SeO5 using first-principles calculations based on a hybrid functional. Although Bi2SeO5 is a chemically ternary compound, each constituent element occupies several crystallographically nonequivalent sites, rendering its defect chemistry highly complex. Due to the anomalous +4 cationic valence state of Se, the defect formation energies of same main group anion antisite defects (SeO and OSe) are prohibitively high, and their concentrations can therefore be neglected. In contrast, the extraordinary cation-cation antisite defects BiSe and SeBi emerge as the dominant defects. The pronounced variability in the formation energies of the six types of VO defects demonstrates that identical defect types located on nonequivalent atomic sites can exhibit markedly different properties. Under O-rich and Se/Bi-poor conditions, Bi2SeO5 shows relatively robust p-type behavior. Conversely, under O-poor and Se/Bi-rich conditions, or at intermediate O, Se, and Bi partial pressures, Bi2SeO5 behaves as an intrinsic semiconductor or displays very weak n-type conductivity due to strong donor-acceptor compensation. This study provides theoretical insights to guide the design and development of high-performance Bi2SeO5-based electronic devices.

Title: On the importance of numerical integration details for homogeneous flow simulation
Authors: Stephen Sanderson, Debra J. Searles
Abstract: The Sllod equations of motion enable modeling of homogeneous flow at the atomic scale, and are commonly used to predict fluid properties such as viscosity. However, few publicly available codes support such simulations, and those that do often do not implement a reversible numerical integration scheme or have other subtle problems. Here, we demonstrate a reversible and energy-conserving integration scheme for the Sllod equations of motion with error on the order of $\delta t^3$, in line with typical operator splitting integrators used in standard molecular dynamics simulations. We discuss various implementation details, and implement the scheme in LAMMPS where we find that our changes enable more accurate simulation of transient responses, mixed flows, and steady states, especially at high rates of flow. Importantly, we show that a lack of energy conservation can manifest as a systematic error in the direct ensemble average of the pressure tensor, leading to an error in the calculated viscosity which becomes significant at high flow rates.

Title: Floquet Chern Insulators and Radiation-Induced Zero Resistance in Irradiated Graphene
Authors: Youngjae Kim, Kwon Park
Abstract: Recent advances in optics and time-resolved techniques have facilitated the exploration of new states of matter under nonequilibrium conditions. Here, we predict that irradiated graphene can host two novel nonequilibrium steady states of matter with zero resistance when exposed to circularly polarized light: (i) Floquet Chern insulators and (ii) a radiation-induced zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution. Specifically, we calculate nonequilibrium anomalous Hall and longitudinal conductivities to map the nonequilibrium phase diagram of irradiated graphene as a function of the driving frequency and the electric-field strength of circularly polarized light. As a result, Floquet Chern insulators are found to occur at high driving frequencies above the graphene band width. By contrast, at low driving frequencies below the graphene band width, the nonequilibrium anomalous Hall conductivity deviates from the expected quantized values, and the nonequilibrium longitudinal conductivity exhibits highly irregular behavior, including negative resistance. It is predicted that the thermodynamically unstable negative resistance will trigger a catastrophic breakdown, inducing a zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution, similar to the radiation-induced zero-resistance state observed in quantum Hall systems.

Title: Observation of a Zero-Field Josephson Diode Effect in a Helimagnet Josephson Junction
Authors: Alexander Beach, Mostafa Tanhayi Ahari, Younghyuk Kim, Kannan Lu, Gregory MacDougall, Matthew Gilbert, Nadya Mason
Abstract: Cr$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ is a transition metal dichalcogenide that is also a chiral helimagnet, and so lacks inversion symmetry and has non-zero Berry curvature in position and momentum space. It is well known that the combination of broken time-reversal symmetry and broken inversion symmetry can generate non-reciprocal phenomena, but the interplay between these kinds of systems and superconductivity is not well known. We present Josephson junctions fabricated from Cr$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ that give magnetic diffraction patterns with asymmetry in both the magnetic field and the critical current. The non-reciprocity in positive critical current and negative critical current, generally called the Josephson diode effect, has an efficiency of up to $\eta=20\%$ in some parts of the magnetic diffraction pattern and persists even at zero applied field. We propose that pinned Abrikosov vortices are a main mechanism for the asymmetric magnetic field response in this system, and that the non-zero spin chirality of the Cr$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ causes the diode effect. Simulations of magnetic diffraction patterns from Josephson junctions with vortices present show offsets from zero-field consistent with observations, while simulations of chiral spin structures with an out-of-plane canting show a diode effect.

Title: Questioning the cuprate paradigm - absence of superfluid density loss in several overdoped cuprates I
Authors: J. L. Tallon, J. G. Storey, J. W. Loram, Jianlin Luo, C. Bernhard, I. Kokanovic, J. R. Cooper
Abstract: It is long established that overdoped cuprate superconductors experience a loss of superfluid density (SFD) with increasing doping, p, along with the decline in T_c. Such behavior is unconventional and suggests a depletion of the condensate by increasing pairbreaking or the growth of a second non-pairing channel. This led to a recent suggestion that the condensate arises from an incoherent charge channel which progressively gives way with overdoping to a second, coherent non-pairing channel. Contra these ideas, we report analysis of the field-dependent electronic specific heat of several cuprates from which we find no apparent loss of SFD with overdoping. The SFD per CuO_2 plaquette is found to rise progressively with overdoping from p towards (1+p), undiminished and much the same as the Hall number, thus implying that all available carriers contribute to the condensate. We suggest this could be the underlying intrinsic behavior for all cuprates. Our samples include (Y,Ca)Ba_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}, Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\delta}, La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4 and Tl_2Ba_2CuO_6, with the latter being the only exception. Our results signal a possible return to a more conventional picture.

Title: Unusual electronic ordering in the pseudogap phase of underdoped cuprate superconductors
Authors: Xiang Li, Minghuan Zeng, Yu Lan, Huaiming Guo, Shiping Feng
Abstract: The pseudogap phase of the underdoped cuprate superconductors harbours diverse manifestations of different ordered electronic-states, and then these ordered electronic-states coexist or compete with superconductivity. Here starting from the microscopic electron propagator, the nature of the ordered electronic-states in the pseudogap phase is investigated within the $T$-matrix approach. This $T$-matrix is derived in terms of the inverse of matrix for various kinds of a single impurity, and then is used to evaluate the local density of states (LDOS) by the involvement of all the quasiparticle excitations and scattering processes. It is shown that a number of the anomalous properties in the underdoped cuprate superconductors is directly correlated to the opening of the normal-state pseudogap: (i) the structure of the microscopic octet scattering model generated by the normal-state pseudogap is essentially the same both in the superconducting (SC)-state and pseudogap phase, which naturally leads to that the quasiparticle scattering interference octet phenomenology observed in the SC-state exists in the pseudogap phase; (ii) however, the spectral weight at around the antinodal region in the SC-state is gapped out completely by both the SC gap and normal-state pseudogap, while it in the pseudogap phase is suppressed partially by the normal-state pseudogap, this directly leads to that the non-dispersive checkerboard charge ordering with a finite wave vector ${\bf Q}$ appears in the pseudogap phase only. The theory therefore also shows that the electronic-states affected by the normal-state pseudogap exhibit the LDOS modulation spectrum organization.

Title: Predicting cement microstructure and mechanical properties in hydrating cement paste with a Phase-Field model
Authors: Alexandre Sac-Morane, Katerina Ioannidou, Manolis Veveakis, Hadrien Rattez
Abstract: Predicting the evolving microstructure of hydrating cement is essential for understanding and modeling its mechanical property development. Physics-based continuum approaches offer a rigorous framework for capturing the thermodynamics of dissolution and precipitation processes at the microstructural scale. In this work, we present an adapted Phase-Field (PF) model for cement hydration that resolves key physical inconsistencies in existing PF formulations by introducing a revised free-energy potential and distinct equilibrium constants for clinker dissolution and hydrate precipitation. The resulting PF framework reproduces microstructural evolution, yielding realistic porosity levels and continuous phase boundaries in close agreement with experimental observations. The predicted hydrated microstructures are subsequently used in a computational homogenization scheme to evaluate the elastic response of the material. The PF-derived mechanical properties show good agreement with experimental trends, supporting the ability of the proposed framework to consistently link hydration chemistry, microstructure formation, and the resulting mechanical response.

Title: Role of impurity statistics and medium constraints in polaron-polaron interactions
Authors: Jesper Levinsen, Francesca Maria Marchetti, Olivier Bleu, Meera M. Parish
Abstract: We consider the behavior of a small density of mobile impurities (polarons) immersed in a quantum gas, a generic scenario that can be realized in cold atomic gases, liquid helium mixtures and doped semiconductors. We present a unified theoretical framework for understanding polaron quasiparticles beyond the single-impurity limit, and we identify two key factors that control the polaron-polaron interactions: (i) the statistics of the impurities, including whether or not they are degenerate, and (ii) the constraints on the medium response, i.e., whether the medium density or chemical potential is held fixed. By constructing wave functions for two bosonic, fermionic, or distinguishable impurities immersed in a Bose or Fermi gas, we derive rigorous results for the polaron interactions in the limit of weak impurity-medium coupling. We furthermore obtain an exact relationship between the polaron interactions at fixed medium density and at fixed chemical potential, a result which is valid for arbitrary interaction strength. Our work provides an important guide for understanding experiments, and it acts as a starting point for future strong-coupling theories of polaron interactions that capture all of the effects identified in this work.

Title: Field-free diode effects in one-dimensional superconductor: a complex interplay between Fulde-Ferrell pairing and altermagnetism
Authors: SVS Sai Ruthvik, Tanay Nag
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of nonreciprocal dissipationless supercurrents in one-dimension manifested through the superconducting diode effect (SDE) and the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in the absence of any external magnetic field, where inversion symmetry (IS) and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) can be intrinsically broken by spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and altermagnetism (AM), respectively. We investigate Ising and Rashba SOC separately in two models where two-component AM, assembled with crystallographic angle, can lead to qualitatively similar indirect band-gap closing and non-reciprocal supercurrent in a Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconductor. Interestingly, in the absence of the above SOCs, SDE persists and the sign of efficiency can be altered by tuning the angle only. Parallel spin components with complementary momentum functions, ensuring the breaking of IS and TRS, can induce SDE in the presence of FF pairing. Continuing the analysis in the context of JDE, we explore the interplay between SOCs and AM with the p-wave and Fulde-Ferrell superconductivity in three different setups. The bulk bands contributes to the non-reciprocity in the case of p-wave superconductivity while JDE is dominated by Andreev bound states for FF superconductivity. Importantly, JDE continues to exist due to finite momentum Cooper pair even without AM and SOC unlike the p-wave superconductivity. The sign of JD efficiency can be tuned with angle for p-wave superconductivity while absence of such sign reversal is a hallmark signature of FF superconductivity. Similar to SDE, parallel spin components in conjunction with p-wave superconductivity can lead to JDE that can also be mediated by only FF pairing in the absence of SOC and AM.

Title: An Investigation of Thermal Properties of Cu-Au Janus Nanoparticles
Authors: Mehmet Akif Cebeci, Hatice Zor Oguz, Sevgi Ozdemir Kart, Hasan Huseyin Kart
Abstract: In this paper, the thermal and structural properties of Cu-Au (Copper-Gold) Janus nanoparticles with a diameter of 5 nm are investigated by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations within the interactions defined by the many-body embedded atom model (EAM). A set of nanoparticle models has been constructed, with varying Cu and Au ratios. MD method is carried out to calculate the melting temperature, heat capacity, radial distribution function (RDF), Lindemann index, mean square displacement (MSD), and diffusion coefficients of these models. The findings demonstrate that nanoparticles rich in Cu exhibit a higher melting temperature and more defined phase transitions. In contrast, structures rich in gold exhibited reduced melting temperatures and showed surface-initiated melting behaviours. MD study highlights that the thermal stability and atomic mobility of Cu-Au Janus nanoparticles depend on the composition ratio and the dispersion of materials.

Title: The stochastic discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation: microscopic derivation and finite-temperature phase transition
Authors: Mahdieh Ebrahimi, Barbara Drossel, Wolfram Just
Abstract: We study a stochastic version of the one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schr{ö}dinger equation (DNSE), which is derived from first principles, and thus possesses all the properties required by statistical mechanics, such as detailed balance and the H-theorem. The stochastic version shows disordered and localised dynamics, and displays a corresponding phase transition at a finite temperature value. The phase transition can be captured in a quantitative way by a mean-field type approach. The corresponding coarsening dynamics shows an unexpected dependence on the noise strength, which is reminiscent of stochastic resonance. The phase transition is linked with negative temperature phase transitions, which have been reported recently for the Hamiltonian dynamics of the DNSE. Our approach gives a clue to how these negative temperature phase transitions can be implemented in experimental setups, which are inevitably coupled to a positive temperature heat bath.

Abstract: Sulfide chalcopyrite Cu(In,Ga)S2 (CIGS) is a wide bandgap semiconductor suitable for the top cell of a tandem solar device. Here we demonstrate significant improvements in absorber quality by alloying with Ag to form (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)S2 (ACIGS) absorbers. We report the Ag alloying effect on compositional, structural, and optoelectronic properties of absorbers. We demonstrate suppressed bulk recombination and improved carrier lifetime in ACIGS, as a result of improved grain size, porosity reduction and defect passivation. We also show that Ag alloying flattens the Ga gradient. Consideration of this impact of Ag will be necessary in future engineering of the Ga profile to maximize charge carrier collection and avoid interface recombination. Exploiting the beneficial effects of Ag alloying, we report a wide bandgap (1.58 eV) ACIGS solar cell with a high power conversion efficiency of 15.5% and a large open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 948 mV, improving on the reference pure CIGS solar cell, with an 11.2% efficiency and an 821 mV VOC. Ag alloying is a useful route to further increase the efficiency of CIGS solar cells and future tandem devices.

Title: Path-integrals and optimal paths for the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
Authors: Bing Miao, Gleb Oshanin, Luca Peliti
Abstract: We derive the path-integral representation of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by Riemann-Liouville fractional Gaussian noise, for both the subdiffusive and superdiffusive regimes. We express the corresponding action, which is a quadratic functional of individual trajectories of the process, in two alternative but equivalent forms: either as a fractional integral or as a double integral with a nonlocal kernel. Moreover, we determine in closed form the optimal (action-minimizing) paths conditioned to reach a prescribed point at a fixed time moment and discuss their behavior, which appears to be non-intuitive for subdiffusive processes in the presence of a strong confining potential.

Title: Optical refractive index measurements of AlGaAs at high temperature for fully automated molecular beam epitaxy growth of Bragg mirrors
Authors: Pierre Gadras (LAAS-PHOTO), Léo Bourdon (LAAS-I2C), Antoine Fées (LAAS-PHOTO), Karim Ben Saddik (LAAS-PHOTO), Guilhem Almuneau (LAAS-PHOTO), Alexandre Arnoult (LAAS-TEAM)
Abstract: In-situ measurement is a key feature to better understand and precisely control the growth of complex structures, such as vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers. In this work, we are showing the precise measurement of optical indices of AlGaAs at 600 {\textdegree}C over a wide spectral range (450--1400 nm). To do so, in-situ spectral reflectance measurement is used, combined with ex-situ layer thickness and composition measurement by x-ray diffraction enabling for precise determination of the optical indices with an accuracy better than 1%. To validate our measurements, we realized the complete automation of the growth of a GaAs/AlAs 940 nm-DBR by molecular beam epitaxy, without the need to pre-calibrate cells fluxes. The fabricated DBR shows a deviation of 0.2 nm of the stop-band central-wavelength compared to the targeted one. This approach holds significant interest for the III--V semiconductor community and epitaxial growth techniques.

Title: Non-Markovian dynamics in ice nucleation
Authors: Pablo Montero de Hijes, Sebastian Falkner, Christoph Dellago
Abstract: In simulation studies of crystallisation, the size of the largest crystalline nucleus is often used as a reaction coordinate to monitor the progress of the nucleation process. Here, we investigate, for the case of homogeneous ice nucleation, whether the nucleus size exhibits Markovian dynamics, as assumed in classical nucleation theory. Using 300 independent nucleation trajectories generated by molecular dynamics, we evaluate the mean recurrence time required to reach selected values of the largest nucleus size. Early recurrences consistently take longer than later ones, revealing a clear history dependence and thus non-Markovian dynamics. To identify the slow modes underlying this behaviour, we analyse several structural descriptors of the nucleus, observing subtle but systematic differences between nuclei at early and late recurrences. By training a neural network on 2,700 short trajectories to learn the committor, we identify relevant collective variables. Based on these features, symbolic regression provides a compact approximation of the committor, i.e., an improved reaction coordinate, which we subsequently test for Markovianity.

Title: Disorder Suppression of Charge Density Wave in the Honeycomb Holstein Model
Authors: Guangchao Li, Lifei Zhang, Tianxing Ma, Qionglin Dai, Lufeng Zhang
Abstract: The formation of charge-density-wave order in Dirac fermion systems via electron-phonon coupling represents a significant topic in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon within the Holstein model on the honeycomb lattice, with a specific focus on the effect of disorder. While the interplay between electron-electron interactions and disorder has long been a central theme in the field, recent attention has increasingly turned to the combined influence of disorder and electron-phonon coupling. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \(\beta_c\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling. Additionally, we observed a suppression of electron kinetic energy and dc conductivity under disorder, highlighting the role of Anderson localization in the degradation of electronic transport. These findings offer significant theoretical insight into the stability and critical phenomena of correlated phases in disordered two-dimensional systems.

Title: Interatomic spin-orbit interaction in a $p$-orbital helical atomic chain
Authors: Takemitsu Kato, Yasuhiro Utsumi, Ora Entin-Wohlman, Amnon Aharony
Abstract: We derive the interatomic spin-orbit interaction (SOI) from a helical atomic chain composed of $p$-orbitals with intra-atomic SOI, which exhibits a helical state--a potential origin of the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. In this model, a strong crystal field in the tangential direction of the helix leads to the formation of energetically separated $\sigma$- and $\pi$-bands. In the second-order process, a spin in the $\sigma$-orbital virtually hops to the $\pi$-orbital, flips its direction due to intra-atomic SOI, and then hops back to the $\sigma$-orbital in the neighboring atom due to the misalignment of $p$-orbitals along the helix. This process induces an interatomic SOI in the $\sigma$-band, which takes the form of a Rashba-type SOI generated by an electric field normal to the helical axis. The magnitude of the SOI is proportional to the curvature, the hopping energy, the intra-atomic SOI energy, and inversely proportional to the crystal field strength. The second-order process also induces long-range second-nearest-neighbor hoppings. We analytically derive the spin-split band structure in the zero-torsion limit.

Title: Massart iron oxide nanoparticles in mechanobiology
Authors: Myriam Reffay (MSC), Gilles Tessier, Jean-François Berret (MSC)
Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) derived from the Massart coprecipitation method have played a pioneering role in bridging materials science and biology. Their magnetic moment and nanoscale dimensions have long enabled applications in magnetic resonance imaging, targeted drug delivery, separation technologies, and hyperthermia. Beyond these well-established uses, a growing research direction has emerged at the interface of physics and biology: the application of MNPs in mechanobiology, the study of how mechanical forces regulate cellular and tissue functions. This review examines how Massart MNPs can be used to generate, transmit, and measure forces within living systems. Particular attention is given to interfacial control through advanced surface chemistries, which ensure colloidal stability, minimize toxicity, and preserve the nanoscale integrity of the particles. We also show that the robustness and scalability of Massart synthesis make it ideally suited to the production of biocompatible nanomaterials in quantities required for comprehensive biological studies. Two complementary approaches are discussed. The first exploits MNP assemblies that arise spontaneously within cells, in the form of endosomes. These compartments enable the application of controlled magnetic forces to study both the formation of reconstructed tissues and organoids, and their viscoelastic response. The second focuses on micrometric magnetic wires fabricated from MNPs, used in active microrheology to probe the cytoplasm of living cells over a wide frequency range. Together, these approaches illustrate how MNP assemblies can accurately quantify cellular and tissue mechanics, providing new opportunities for mechanobiological studies and enabling the development of novel readouts of cellular mechanics with potential diagnostic applications.

Title: Cytoplasmic flow induced by a rotating wire in living cells: Magnetic rotational spectroscopy and finite element simulations
Authors: Charles Paul Moore, Foad Ghasemi, Jean-François Berret (MSC)
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted intracellular viscosity as a key biomechanical property with potential as a biomarker for cancer cell metastasis. In the context of cellular mechanobiology, magnetic rotational spectroscopy (MRS), which employs rotating magnetic wires of length\,! = 2-8 $\mu$m to probe cytoplasmic rheology, has emerged as an effective method for quantifying intracellular viscoelasticity. This study examines microrheology data from three breast epithelial cell lines, MCF-10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231, along with new data from HeLa cervical cancer cells. Here, MRS is combined with finite element simulations to characterize the flow field induced by wire rotation in the cytoplasm. COMSOL simulations performed at low Reynolds numbers show that the flow velocity is localized around the wire, and display characteristic dumbbellshaped profiles. For wires representative of MRS experiments in cells, the product of shear rate and cytoplasmic relaxation time (''$ with $ ~ 1 s) remains below unity, indicating that the flow occurs within the linear regime. This outcome confirms that MRS can reliably measure the zeroshear viscosity of the intracellular medium in living cells. This study also demonstrates that integrating MRS intracellular measurements with COMSOL simulations significantly improves the reliability of in vitro assessments of cytoplasmic mechanical properties.

Title: Defect-Limited Efficiency of Pnictogen Chalcohalide Solar Cells
Authors: Cibrán López, Seán R. Kavanagh, Pol Benítez, Edgardo Saucedo, Aron Walsh, David O. Scanlon, Claudio Cazorla
Abstract: Pnictogen chalcohalides (MChX) have recently emerged as promising nontoxic and environmentally friendly photovoltaic absorbers, combining strong light absorption coefficients with favorable low-temperature synthesis conditions. Despite these advantages and reported optimized morphologies, device efficiencies remain below 10%, far from their ideal radiative limit. To uncover the origin of these performance losses, we present a systematic and fully consistent first-principles investigation of the defect chemistry across the Bi-based chalcohalide family. Our results reveal a complex defect landscape dominated by chalcogen vacancies of low formation energy, which act as deep nonradiative recombination centers. Despite their moderate charge-carrier capture coefficients, the high equilibrium concentrations of these defects reduce the theoretical maximum efficiencies by 6% in BiSeI and by 10% in BiSeBr. In contrast, sulfur vacancies in BiSI and BiSBr are comparatively benign, presenting smaller capture coefficients due to weaker electron-phonon coupling. Interestingly, despite its huge nonradiative charge-carrier recombination rate, BiSeI presents the best conversion efficiency among all four compounds owing to its most suitable bandgap for outdoor photovoltaic applications. Our findings identify defect chemistry as a critical bottleneck in MChX solar cells and proposes chalcogen-rich synthesis conditions and targeted anion substitutions as effective strategies for mitigation of detrimental vacancies.

Title: Exact results and instabilities in the harmonic approximation of active crystals
Authors: Connor Roberts, Gunnar Pruessner
Abstract: Condensates of active particles such as cells form almost-crystalline lattices which play a central role in many biological systems. Typically, their properties have been determined merely by analogy to the rather trivial one-dimensional case, leaving a gap between experimentally accessible observables and suitable theoretical models. Within a harmonic approximation, we characterise analytically a two-dimensional triangular lattice of active particles that interact with their nearest neighbours through a general pair potential, obtaining exact expressions for the correlators. We study this "active crystal" as a means of characterising active matter in the dense phase. Our treatment correctly approximates arbitrary pair potentials, rather than demanding an unphysical non-singular bilinear form. We retain "off-diagonal" terms that are routinely neglected despite quantifying the anisotropy of the particles' local potential. From the exact expressions for the correlation matrices, we derive exact results that shed light on the presence (or absence) of crystalline order. We further calculate the mean-squared particle separation, energy, entropy production rate and the onset of a pressure-induced instability resulting in the breakdown of the harmonic approximation. The entropy production rate is found to have a general form that is valid for generic active particles and lattice geometries, while resembling that of non-interacting "active modes".

Title: Eu-assisted enhancement of photoresponse in MBE-grown CdO/Si photodetectors
Authors: Igor Perlikowski, Eunika Zielony, Abinash Adhikari, Rafał Jakieła, Sergij Chusnutdinow, Ewa Popko, Ewa Przeździecka
Abstract: Doping cadmium oxide with rare earth (RE) elements is a way to control the band gap and enhance carrier concentration and mobility. This work presents how one of REs, europium, impacts performance of CdO/Si diode. The samples were grown using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Doping level was modified by changing the temperature of the effusion cell with Eu and therefore flux of Eu particles. Different dopant concentrations were confirmed by secondary ion mass spectrometry. Atomic force microscopy images revealed a grain-like surface structure of the samples with grain size increasing after rapid thermal processing (RTP). Raman spectroscopy showed that introducing Eu changes vibrational properties of CdO through intraionic anharmonicity reduction. Kelvin probe method revealed upward band bending caused by oxygen adsorption during RTP. Electrical measurements confirmed that rectifying junctions were manufactured and that they are able to produce photocurrent in the spectral range of 450-1150 nm without external voltage bias. Introducing Eu into CdO was found to increase e.g. rectifying factor and responsivity. The results show that doping CdO with Eu is a way to enhance performance of the presented zero-power-consumption photodetectors, making it a promising material for future applications in optoelectronics.

Title: Origin of Bright Quantum Emissions with High Debye-Waller factor in Silicon Nitride
Authors: Shibu Meher, Manoj Dey, Abhishek Kumar Singh
Abstract: Silicon nitride has emerged as a promising photonic platform for integrated single-photon sources, yet the microscopic origin of the recently observed bright quantum emissions remains unclear. Using hybrid density functional theory, we show that the negatively charged N$_\text{Si}$V$_\text{N}$ center (NV$^{-}$) in the C$_{1h}$ configuration exhibits a linearly polarized zero-phonon line (ZPL) at 2.46 eV, with a radiative lifetime of 9.01 ns and a high Debye-Waller (DW) factor of 33%. We further find that the C$_{1h}$ configuration is prone to a pseudo-Jahn-Teller distortion, yielding two symmetrically equivalent defect structures that emit bright, linearly polarized ZPL at 1.80 eV with a lifetime of 10.17 ns and an increased DW factor of 41%. These nitrogen-vacancy-related defects explain the origins of visible quantum emissions, paving the way for deterministic and monolithically integrated silicon-nitride quantum photonics.

Title: Real-Space Spectral Approach to Orbital Magnetization
Authors: Kevin J. U. Vidarte, Henrique P. Veiga, João M. Viana Parente Lopes, Ramon Cardias, Aires Ferreira, Tarik P. Cysne, Tatiana G. Rappoport
Abstract: We present a real-space spectral method for computing the orbital magnetization of crystals. Starting from the commutator form of the orbital magnetization operator, we formulate an energy-resolved spectral function that is amenable to exact Chebyshev polynomial expansions and yields the total magnetization upon integration up to the Fermi level. This avoids the need for computing eigenstates and ground-state projects, providing an efficient numerical framework that is applicable to very large systems even in the presence of disorder and temperature. Our approach is benchmarked on the Haldane model, finding results that are in excellent agreement with the modern $k$-space formulation of orbital magnetization. Leveraging this technique, we extend our study to systems with uncorrelated disorder and point defects, and further show that the bulk Chern number can be directly obtained from the magnetization spectral density. These results open a promising route to investigate orbital responses and topological transitions in real-space models of quantum materials with realistic complexity.

Title: Manipulating fractional Shapiro steps in twisted cuprate Josephson junctions
Authors: Yuying Zhu, Heng Wang, Ding Zhang, Qi-Kun Xue
Abstract: High$-$quality Josephson junctions made of twisted cuprate superconductors offer unprecedented opportunities in addressing fundamental problems and realizing next$-$generation superconducting devices at relatively high temperatures. Whether or not the twisted cuprates possess high$-$temperature topological superconductivity remains an outstanding issue. Here, we tackle this problem via an in$-$depth study of the key predicted feature $--$ half$-$integer Shapiro steps. We show that half$-$integer Shapiro steps do occur in samples at a twist angle of 45$^\circ$ but are unstable with thermal cycling. Interestingly, fractional steps can be introduced by training the sample with a small magnetic field or annealing with a large electrical current, attesting to a tunable current$-$phase relation (CPR) in twisted cuprates. We extend the current annealing to realize fractional steps with odd denominators too. Furthermore, half$-$integer steps can be induced in the regime that is well beyond the expectation of topological superconductivity, favoring an alternative mechanism involving trapped vortices. Our results not only caution the direct association of half$-$integer Shapiro steps with the exotic mechanism but also open a distinct pathway toward a Josephson junction with electrically tunable CPR at high temperatures.

Title: Electric polarization driven by non-collinear spin alignment investigated by first principles calculations
Authors: Sergiy Mankovsky, Svitlana Polesya, Jan Minar, Hubert Ebert
Abstract: We present an approach for first principles investigations on the spin driven electric polarization in type II multiferroics. We propose a parametrization of the polarization with the parameters calculated using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green function (KKR-GF) formalism. Within this approach the induced electric polarization of a unit cell is represented in terms of three-site parameters. Those antisymmetric with respect to spin permutation are seen as an ab-initio based counter-part to the phenomenological parameters used within the inverse-Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-interaction (DMI) model. Due to their relativistic origin, these parameters are responsible for the electric polarization induced in the presence of a non-collinear spin alignment in materials with a centrosymmetric crystal structure. Beyond to this, our approach gives direct access to the element- or site-resolved electric polarization. To demonstrate the capability of the approach, we consider several examples of the so-called type II multiferroics, for which the magneto-electric effect is observed either as a consequence of an applied magnetic field (we use Cr$_2$O$_3$ as a prototype), or as a result of a phase transition to a spin-spiral magnetic state, as for instance in MnI$_2$, CuCrO$_2$ and AgCrO$_2$.

Title: First-principles screening of materials with extreme effective masses
Authors: Szymon Błazucki, Junfeng Qiao, Nicola Marzari
Abstract: The effective mass of charge carriers is a fundamental descriptor of the electronic structure of materials, and can be used to assess performance in electronics applications, or to screen for thermoelectrics and transparent conductors. Here, we perform a high-throughput computational screening of approximately 20,000 experimentally known three-dimensional stoichiometric inorganics obtained from the Materials Cloud 3D structure database. By combining density-functional theory calculations and maximally localized Wannier functions, we are able to compute the full conductivity effective mass tensor for electrons and holes from the Boltzmann transport equation in the constant relaxation-time approximation. This approach captures the effects of band non-parabolicity, anisotropy, and valley multiplicity that would be neglected by standard parabolic fittings. The screening identifies a curated set of candidates exhibiting extreme electronic properties, from ultra-low to ultra-large effective masses, these latter associated with flat-band physics. We validate the workflow by recovering established high-mobility semiconductors and highlight promising novel candidates. Furthermore, we classify materials by their mass anisotropy and discuss the physical limits of defining a conductivity effective mass in narrow-gap regimes at room temperature. The resulting dataset provides a systematic roadmap to search for high-performance materials in novel chemical spaces.

Title: A Three-Dimensional Array of Quantum Dots
Authors: Hanifa Tidjani, Dario Denora, Michael Chan, Jann Hinnerk Ungerer, Barnaby van Straaten, Stefan D. Oosterhout, Lucas Stehouwer, Giordano Scappucci, Menno Veldhorst
Abstract: Quantum dots can confine single electrons or holes to define spin qubits that can be operated with high fidelity. Experimental work has progressed from linear to two-dimensional arrays of quantum dots, enabling qubit interactions that are essential for quantum simulation and computation. Here, we explore architectures beyond planar geometries by constructing quantum dot arrays in three dimensions. We realize an eight-quantum dot system in a silicon-germanium heterostructure comprising two stacked germanium quantum wells, where quantum dots are positioned at the vertices of a cuboid. Using electrostatic gate control, we load a single hole into any of the eight quantum dots. To demonstrate the potential of multilayer quantum dot systems, we show coherent spin control and hopping-induced spin rotations by shuttling between the quantum wells. The ability to extend quantum dot arrays in three dimensions provides opportunities for novel quantum hardware and high-connectivity quantum circuits.

Title: Distinguish the Orientation of Sliding Ferroelectricity by Second-Harmonic Generation
Authors: Fengfeng Ye, Qiankun Li, Zhuocheng Lu, Xinfeng Chen, Yang Li, Hua Wang, Lu You, Gaoyang Gou
Abstract: As the emerging ferroelectric (FE) materials, the ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) sliding ferroelectrics without phase-matching bottleneck, usually exhibit the pronounced second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Despite the structural polarity of sliding ferroelectrics can be precisely detected via SHG characterizations, distinguishing the orientations of sliding ferroelectricity based on SHG responses has rarely been realized, as SHG intensities for upward and downward polarization states are supposed to be same. In current work, combining computational simulations and experimental characterizations, the orientation of sliding ferroelectricity is demonstrated to be readily distinguishable via SHG responses in 2D SnP2S6 (SnP2Se6), a new sliding FE material. Specifically, owing to the unique symmetry operation within FE-SnP2S6 (SnP2Se6), the intersection between \c{hi}xxx and \c{hi}yyy SHG susceptibility coefficients with opposite signs leads to the effective rotation of SHG polar directions upon switching of sliding ferroelectricity. Moreover, the remarkable dependence of SHG polar directions on the orientation of sliding ferroelectricity is further validated by experimental characterizations performed on SnP2S6 crystal in a single FE domain structural form. This work opens up the avenue for in-situ detecting the ferroelectricity orientation of 2D sliding ferroelectrics based on SHG nonlinear optical responses, and also demonstrates the controllable optical nonlinearly for new "slidetronics" applications.

Title: Quasistatic response for nonequilibrium processes: evaluating the Berry potential and curvature
Authors: Aaron Beyen, Faezeh Khodabandehlou, Christian Maes
Abstract: We investigate how introducing slow, time-dependent perturbations to a steady, nonequilibrium process alters the expected (excess) values of important observables, such as the dynamical activity and entropy flux. When we make a cyclic thermodynamic transformation, the excesses are described in terms of a (geometric) Berry phase with corresponding Berry potential and Berry curvature quantifying the response. Focussing on Markov jump processes, we show how a non-zero Berry curvature leads to a breakdown of the thermodynamic Maxwell relations and of the Clausius heat theorem. We also present a variant of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in which the parameters follow a curve with vanishing Berry curvature, but the system still experiences a nonzero Berry phase. Finally, we identify (sufficient) no-localization conditions in terms of mean first-passage times under which the corresponding Berry potentials and curvatures vanish at absolute zero, extending, for arbitrary driving, e.g. the case of vanishing heat capacity as for the Nernst postulate.

Title: Revealing the tribological stress field by using deformation twins as probes
Authors: Antje Dollmann, Alexander Dyck, Claudius Klein, Alexander Kauffmann, Thomas Boehlke, Christian Greiner
Abstract: Microstructural evolution in metallic materials feedbacks with the loading conditions and influences the life time of parts and components. Therefore, the deformation mechanisms have to be fundamentally understood. Tribological loading causes a non-trivial, position-dependent, moving stress field. We present a systematic study on the influence of the complexity of the implemented material models on the calculated stress field. For the stress field validation, results of tribological experiments on single crystals with the activation of deformation twins are used. The resolved shear stresses calculated with the stress field models have to be highest on the experimentally identified twin systems. From this combination of modelling and experiment, it clearly follows that a stress field model considering plasticity is required. The widely used Hamilton stress field for tribological loading is limited due to only considering elastic strains. Here, the predictive quality of the stress field is sensitive to the assumed yield strength, work hardening and plastic anisotropy. Certain stress field models are close to the experimental data, but none completely replicate them. These results highlight that the model type and parameters have to be carefully determined in order to be able to predict how a metallic material deforms due to a sliding load.

Title: Floquet-induced $p_x+ip_y$ bosonic pair condensate
Authors: Zhizhen Chen, Jiale Huang, Mingpu Qin, Zi Cai
Abstract: In this study, we propose a dynamical pairing mechanism other than the pair-wise interactions. Starting from a two-dimensional hard-core boson model with periodically modulated hopping amplitude, we derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian with three-site interactions that are responsible for unconventional pairing between adjacent bosons. By performing a density matrix renormalization group study on this three-site interacting Hamiltonian, we reveal a bosonic pair condensate with $p_x+ ip_y$ symmetry, while the single-particle Bose-Einstein condensate is completely depleted. The experimental implementations of the proposed model on polar molecular systems and superconducting quantum circuit have also been discussed.

Title: Distinct Modulation Behavior of Superconducting Coherence Peaks Associated with Sign-Reversal Gaps in FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$
Authors: Zhiyong Hou, Zhiyuan Shang, Wen Duan, Wei Xie, Huan Yang, Hai-Hu Wen
Abstract: Using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we reveal two distinct types of superconducting (SC) gap modulations in bulk superconductor FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$. By analyzing the phase relation between modulations at positive and negative bias, we identify in-phase (particle-hole asymmetric) and anti-phase (particle-hole symmetric) oscillations, corresponding to sign-reversing and sign-preserving scattering processes, respectively. The observed features are consistent with predictions from pair-breaking scattering interference (PBSI) theory and are distinguishable from other alternative mechanisms such as pair density waves. Our results provide compelling evidence that PBSI is the dominant mechanism behind the SC gap modulations in FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$, offering new insights into the role of impurity scattering in iron-based superconductors.

Title: Atomic-scale Origin of Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya Interaction in Pt/Fe/Au
Authors: Emanuele Longo, Gianluca Gubbiotti, Matteo Belli, Claudia Wiemer, Mario Alia, M. Fanciulli, Roberto Mantovan
Abstract: Recent results show remarkable interfacial--Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (i-DMI) in magnetic heterostructures composed of relatively thick Fe thin films ($\gg 1$ nm). To investigate its origin, we present a thorough magnetic characterization of the SiO$_2$/${}^{57}\mathrm{Fe}$($t$)/Au and SiO$_2$/Pt/${}^{57}\mathrm{Fe}$($t$)/Au heterostructures ($t = 1.6$ - $2.2$ nm). An i-DMI constant of $D_s^{\mathrm{Pt}} = 0.43\,\mathrm{mJ\,m^{-2}}$ is extracted for the Pt/Fe/Au system, as probed by wavevector-resolved Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy. Ferromagnetic resonance and conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy indicate that significant surface anisotropy is present in Pt/Fe/Au, and that an interfacial Fe fraction ($\sim18$) exhibits tilted magnetization ($\sim25^\circ$ out of plane) and an enhanced hyperfine field, correlating with the stronger i-DMI.

Title: Reversible nanopore sealing and in situ iron oxide nanoparticle synthesis on thin silicon nitride membranes
Authors: Zehui Xia, Pia Bhatia, Celia Morral, Brian DiPaolo, Iryna Golovina, Adriana Buvač-Drndić, Chih-Yuan Lin, David Niedzwiecki, Marija Drndić
Abstract: We report in-situ synthesis of iron oxide particles inside silicon nitride nanopores via a chemical reaction, monitored by current readout. Nanopores were formed by electroporation on glass chips (diameters from 1.7 to 11.3 nm), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) drilling (diameters from 6.5 to 64.6 nm), or hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching (diameters from 12.6 to 36.2 nm) in 5 to 20 nm thick membranes. Nanopores seal on timescales from ~1 ms to ~3.6 s, across a range of sizes and concentrations. We show single and ~5-pore arrays, as fabricated, after sealing, and after cleaning and pore recovery. These results are independent of fabrication method. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), aberration-corrected scanning TEM (AC-STEM), and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) verify the synthesis of mixed magnetite and maghemite iron oxide. This work advances nanoparticle-nanopore chips for applications in biosensing, plasmonics and photonics when position and size control is required.

Title: Transition Metal Dichalcogenide 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$ Nanoscale Films as Spin Pumping Platforms
Authors: Emanuele Longo, Pinakapani Tummala, M. Belli, Alessio Lamperti, Christian Martella, Alessandro Molle, Marco Fanciulli, Roberto Mantovan
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a promising class of materials for spintronics, with the aim of promoting efficient spin-charge conversion (SCC) in TMD/ferromagnet (FM)-based devices. The MoTe$_2$ semimetal with distorted orthorhombic crystal structure in the 1T$'$ phase has gathered particular attention due to its high spin-orbit coupling and reconfigurability as a type-II Weyl semimetal close to room temperature. Here, we report on the role of chemically grown 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$ thin films in inducing SCC in 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$/FM heterostructures as measured at room temperature. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and electrically detected spin-pumping FMR measurements performed on 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$/Co/Au and 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$/Au/Co/Au heterostructures reveal a spin-mixing conductance value of up to $\sim1.6 \times 10^{20}~\mathrm{m^{-2}}$ and a spin Hall angle of $1.7\%$. These findings position MoTe$_2$ thin films as a competitive spin-charge conversion option compared to other functional materials (e.g., heavy metals, topological insulators), highlighting their potential for future applications in spintronic devices.

Title: Exciton-Polariton hybrid skin-topological states
Authors: Ruiqi Bao, R. Banerjee, S. Mandal, Huawen Xu, Shiji Li, Junfeng Gao, Timothy C. H. Liew
Abstract: The non Hermitian skin effect, where bulk states accumulate at system boundaries, challenges the conventional bulk boundary correspondence. Here we propose a scheme to realize hybrid skin topological states in exciton polariton honeycomb lattices by introducing sublattice dependent gain and loss. This non Hermiticity couples with the intrinsic topological edge modes, leading to relocalization of edge states. We show two distinct regimes: hybrid skin Chern states with switchable localization controlled by TE TM splitting , and hybrid skin antichiral states which preserves the spin polarized property. Our results bridge polariton spin physics and non-Hermitian topology, opening routes toward controllable non reciprocal and spin polarized transport.

Title: Quantum dynamics of monitored free fermions
Authors: Igor Poboiko, Alexander D. Mirlin
Abstract: We explore, both analytically and numerically, the quantum dynamics of a many-body free-fermion system subjected to local density measurements. We begin by extending the mapping to the nonlinear sigma-model (NLSM) field theory for the case of finite evolution time $T$ and different classes of initial states, which lead to different NLSM boundary conditions. The analytical formalism is then used to study how quantum correlations gradually develop, with increasing $T$, from those determined by the initial state towards their steady-state form. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations for several types of initial states. We further consider the long-time limit, when the system in $d+1$ space-time dimensions becomes quasi-one-dimensional, and analyze the scaling of the ``localization'' time (which is simultaneously the purification time and the charge-sharpening time for this class of problems). The analytical predictions for scaling properties are fully confirmed by numerical simulations in a $d=2$ model around the measurement-induced phase transition. We use this dynamical approach to determine numerically the measurement-induced transition point and the associated correlation-length critical exponent.

Title: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Vortex Crystal Candidate in the Triangular $S=1/2$ Quantum Antiferromagnet

Abstract: The prospect of merging the paradigms of geometric frustration on a triangular lattice and bond anisotropies in the strong spin-orbit coupling limit holds tremendous promise in the ongoing hunt for exotic quantum materials. Here we identify a new candidate system to realize such physics, the organic quantum antiferromagnet (CD$_3$ND$_3$)$_2$NaRuCl$_6$. We report a combination of thermodynamic, magneto-elastic and neutron scattering experiments on single-crystals to determine the phase diagram in axial magnetic fields $\mathbf{H \parallel c}$ and propose a minimal model Hamiltonian. (CD$_3$ND$_3$)$_2$NaRuCl$_6$ displays an ideal triangular arrangement of Ru$^{3+}$ ions adopting the spin-orbital entangled $j_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ state. It hosts residual magnetic order below $T_{\rm N} = 0.23$ K and a highly unusual $H-T$ phase diagram including three different incommensurate states. Spin-waves in the high-field polarized regime are well described by a Heisenberg-like triangular lattice Hamiltonian with a potential sub-leading bond dependent anisotropy term. We discuss possible candidate magnetic structures in the various observed phases and propose two mechanisms that could explain the field-dependent incommensurability, requiring either a small ferromagnetic Kitaev term or a tiny magneto-elastic $J-J'$ isosceles distortion driven by pseudospin-lattice coupling. We argue that the multi-$\mathbf{q}$ ground state in zero magnetic field is a prime candidate for hosting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex crystal proposed on the triangular Heisenberg-Kitaev model. (CD$_3$ND$_3$)$_2$NaRuCl$_6$ is the first member in an extended family of quantum triangular lattice magnets, providing a new playground to study the interplay of geometric frustration and spin-orbit effects.

Title: Anomalous Eigenstates of a Doped Hole in the Ising Antiferromagnet
Authors: Piotr Wrzosek, Krzysztof Wohlfeld, Eugene A. Demler, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: The problem of a mobile hole doped into an antiferromagnet Mott insulator is believed to underly the rich physics of several paradigmatic strongly correlated electron systems, ranging from heavy fermions to high-Tc superconductivity. Arguably the simplest incarnation of this problem corresponds to a doped Ising antiferromagnet, a problem widely considered essentially solved since almost 60 years by a popular yet approximate mapping to a single-particle problem on the Bethe lattice. Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-Néel state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem. From their direct spectral signatures we further conclude that these states lead to anomalously slow thermalization behavior -- hence representing a new type of quantum many-body scar state, potentially related to many-body scars predicted in lattice gauge theories.

Title: Fabrication and Properties of NbN/NbNx/NbN and Nb/NbNx/Nb Josephson Junctions
Authors: Sergey K. Tolpygo, Ravi Rastogi, David Kim, Terence J. Weir, Neel Parmar, Evan B. Golden (Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lexington, MA)
Abstract: Increasing integration scale of superconductor electronics (SCE) requires employing kinetic inductors and self-shunted Josephson junctions (JJs) for miniaturizing inductors and JJs. We have been developing a ten-superconductor-layer planarized fabrication process with NbN kinetic inductors and searching for suitable self-shunted JJs to potentially replace high Josephson critical current density, Jc, Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb junctions. We report on the fabrication and electrical properties of NbN/NbNx/NbN junctions produced by reactive sputtering in Ar+N2 mixture on 200-mm wafers at 200 oC and incorporated into a planarized process with two Nb ground planes and Nb wiring layer. Here NbN is a stoichiometric nitride with superconducting critical temperature Tc =15 K and NbNx is a high resistivity, nonsuperconducting nitride deposited using a higher nitrogen partial pressure than for the NbN electrodes. For comparison, we co-fabricated Nb/NbNx/Nb JJs using the same NbNx barriers deposited at 20 oC. We varied the NbNx barrier thickness from 5 nm to 20 nm, resulting in the range of Jc from about 1 mA/um^2 down to ~10 uA/um^2, and extracted coherence length of 3 nm and 4 nm in NbNx deposited, respectively at 20 oC and 200 oC. Both types of JJs are well described by resistively and capacitively shunted junction model without any excess current. We found the Jc of NbN/NbNx/NbN JJs to be somewhat lower than of Nb/NbNx/Nb JJs with the same barrier thickness, despite a much higher Tc and energy gap of NbN than of Nb electrodes. IcRn products up to ~ 0.5 mV were obtained for JJs with Jc~ 0.6 mA/um^2. Jc(T) dependences have been measured.

Title: Confinement-Induced Resonances in Rabi-Coupled Bosonic Mixtures
Authors: Andrea Tononi, Pietro Massignan
Abstract: We consider coherently-coupled bosonic mixtures scattering at low energies in the presence of an external confinement along either one or two directions. We exactly solve the two-body scattering problem, showing that for large Rabi coupling the confinement-induced resonance can be displaced towards scattering lengths values much smaller than the oscillator length. Our results make the observation of confinement-induced resonances more tunable and accessible, offering yet another handle for the efficient control of strong interactions in ultracold quantum gases.

Title: Topological Order in Deep State
Authors: Ahmed Abouelkomsan, Max Geier, Liang Fu
Abstract: Topologically ordered states are among the most interesting quantum phases of matter that host emergent quasi-particles having fractional charge and obeying fractional quantum statistics. Theoretical study of such states is however challenging owing to their strong-coupling nature that prevents conventional mean-field treatment. Here, we demonstrate that an attention-based deep neural network provides an expressive variational wavefunction that discovers fractional Chern insulator ground states purely through energy minimization without prior knowledge and achieves remarkable accuracy. We introduce an efficient method to extract ground state topological degeneracy -- a hallmark of topological order -- from a single optimized real-space wavefunction in translation-invariant systems by decomposing it into different many-body momentum sectors. Our results establish neural network variational Monte Carlo as a versatile tool for discovering strongly correlated topological phases.

Title: Phase Diagram and Criticality of the Modified Primitive Electrolyte Model in Bulk and in Inert and Conducting Confinement
Authors: Philipp Stärk, Alexander Schlaich
Abstract: Ionic fluids under conductive confinement are central to technologies such as batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. Their interfacial behavior governs energy storage and electrochemical processes. Despite their importance, the thermodynamics of even simple models -- such as the charged Lennard-Jones fluid -- remain underexplored in this regime. We present an extended Wang-Landau sampling approach to efficiently compute the density of states of charged mixtures with respect to the particle number. The method supports simulations in both bulk and confined geometries. Combined with the Constant Potential Method, it also enables to study effects due to confining electrodes. We employ this approach to study symmetric, binary mixtures of charged Lennard-Jones particles -- the modified Restricted Primitive Model -- in bulk, in inert confinement, and in conductive confinement at the potential of zero charge. Our results show that confinement shifts the vapor-liquid critical point to lower temperatures and higher densities compared to bulk, in line with the classical concept of capillary condensation. Importantly, conductive boundaries significantly lower the chemical potential of coexistence relative to inert confinement. These findings offer deeper insight into the phase behavior of ionic fluids in energy-relevant porous environments.

Title: Digamma-Function Representation of the Ground-State Energy in Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg $\mathrm{XXX}_s$ Spin Chains
Authors: Reaz Shafqat
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain remains a central framework for exploring exactly solvable models within quantum integrable systems. For the isotropic XXX chain, the ground-state energy per site of the spin-1/2 system is famously given by ln2. Extending the classic formulations to arbitrary spin-s, Takhtajan and Babujian derived two separate finite-series expressions for integer and half-integer spin representations. Current work introduces a unified analytical expression for the ground-state energy density in terms of the digamma function. This compact formulation reproduces both Takhtajan Babujian series.

Title: Refining Heuristic Predictors of Fractional Chern Insulators using Machine Learning
Authors: Oriol Mayné i Comas, André Grossi Fonseca, Sachin Vaidya, Marin Soljačić
Abstract: We develop an interpretable, data-driven framework to quantify how single-particle band geometry governs the stability of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Using large-scale exact diagonalization, we evaluate an FCI metric that yields a continuous spectral measure of FCI stability across parameter space. We then train Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) -- a recently developed interpretable neural architecture -- to regress this metric from two band-geometric descriptors: the trace violation $T$ and the Berry curvature fluctuations $\sigma_B$. Applied to spinless fermions at filling $\nu=1/3$ in models on the checkerboard and kagome lattices, our approach yields compact analytical formulas that predict FCI stability with over $>80 \%$ accuracy in both regression and classification tasks, and remain reliable even in data-scarce regimes. The learned relations reveal model-dependent trends, clarifying the limits of Landau-level-mimicking heuristics. Our framework provides a general method for extracting simple, phenomenological "laws" that connect many-body phase stability to chosen physical descriptors, enabling rapid hypothesis formation and targeted design of quantum phases.

Abstract: Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) and four-wave mixing in $\chi^{(2)}$ and $\chi^{(3)}$ media underpin most entangled-photon sources, but direct generation of higher-order entangled multiphoton states by $n$-th order parametric downconversion remains extremely challenging because conventional materials exhibit tiny high-order nonlinearities. Here we show that single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, an excitonic Mott insulator on a breathing Kagome lattice, supports exceptionally large nonlinear susceptibilities up to seventh order. Many-body GW--Bethe--Salpeter and time-dependent BSE / Kadanoff--Baym simulations yield resonant $\chi^{(2)}$--$\chi^{(7)}$ for monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, with $|\chi^{(4)}|$ and $|\chi^{(5)}|$ surpassing values in prototypical transition metal dichalcogenides by 5--9 orders of magnitude. We trace this enhancement to flat bands and strongly bound Frenkel excitons with ferroelectrically aligned out-of-plane dipoles. Building on experimentally demonstrated 1$\times N$ integrated beam splitters with arbitrary power ratios, we propose an on-chip architecture where each output arm hosts an Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ patch, optionally gated by graphene to tune the complex $n$-photon amplitudes. Using the ab-initio $\chi^{(3)}$ and $\chi^{(4)}$ values, we predict that three-photon GHZ$_3$ and four-photon cluster-state sources in this platform can achieve $n$-photon generation rates up to $\sim 10^8$ and $\sim 10^6$ times larger, respectively, than silica-fiber- and MoS$_2$-based implementations with comparable geometry. We derive the quantum Hamiltonian and explicit $n$-photon generation rates for this platform, and show how suitable interferometric networks enable electrically and spectrally tunable GHZ, $W$, and cluster states based on genuine high-order nonlinear processes in a 2D excitonic Mott insulator.

Title: Onsager Condensation in Chiral Active Matter: Universality of Topological Gas Dynamics
Authors: Magnus F Ivarsen
Abstract: We identify a thermodynamic phase transition in chiral active matter. Low-frequency disorder triggers global synchronisation and energy dissipation, while high disorder activates a topological heat pump, generating an inverse energy cascade. This drives the system towards an Onsager dipole, which can be arrested into a metastable vortex glass if dispersion is insufficient to overcome the defect lattice. We propose topological gas dynamics as a universality class governed by the interplay of active disorder and topological sorting, unifying active swarms and classical inviscid fluids.

Title: First-principles band alignment engineering in polar and nonpolar orientations for wurtzite AlN, GaN, and B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N alloys
Authors: Cody L Milne, Arunima K Singh
Abstract: Boron aluminum nitride (B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N) is a promising material for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices due to its ultra-wide bandgap, high thermal stability, and compatibility with other III-nitride semiconductors. Despite its potential, the band alignments of B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N remain largely unexplored, although this information is essential for device design. In this study, we compute the valence and conduction band alignments of nonpolar ($a$-plane) and polar ($c$-plane) B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N, and compare them with those of AlN and GaN. Using density functional theory, many-body perturbation theory, $GW_0$ method, and a novel passivation scheme, we find that they have near-zero valence band alignments for low-$x$ B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/AlN, while higher compositions ($x > $0.333) exhibit type I or II band alignments. The band alignments also show a notable dependence on surface polarity and the tetrahedral distortion of the B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N structures. Our computed offsets are in good agreement with available experimental data. Due to their low valence band alignments and higher conduction band alignments, the B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/AlN heterostructures could be well suited for high-electron-mobility transistors and ultraviolet light-emitting diodes. The band alignments of B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N determined in this study provide essential design guidelines for integrating these ultra-wide bandgap alloys into advanced semiconductor technologies.

Title: Collapse of the superconducting order parameter in Ising superconductors with Rashba spin-orbit coupling
Authors: J. S. Harms, M. Hein, W. Belzig
Abstract: Ising superconductors have attracted quite some attention recently, due to their resilience against magnetic fields way beyond the Pauli-paramagnetic limit. Their protection against external magnetic field relies on strong Ising spin-orbit coupling, which originates from in-plane inversion symmetry breaking. Due to the heavy atom nature of Ising SCs, a smaller but sizable Rashba SOC could be present through gating or interfacial effects. Here, we consider the effect of Rashba SOC in a two valley model of Ising superconductors with an attractive $s$-wave interaction. We show that Rashba SOC gives a critical magnetic field, above which the superconducting order parameter collapses at low temperatures. This effect, however, disappears at high temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the low- and high temperature physics of Ising SCs is quantitatively and qualitatively different in our two-valley model, and may lead to new ways to determine the strength of the Rashba SOC in Ising SCs.

Title: Local chemical order suppresses grain boundary migration under irradiation in CrCoNi
Authors: Ian Geiger, Penghui Cao, Timothy J. Rupert
Abstract: Complex concentrated alloys with intrinsic chemical heterogeneity are promising candidates for nuclear applications, where local chemical order can strongly influence defect evolution under irradiation. Grain boundaries also contribute to radiation damage mitigation by serving as defect sinks, yet this interaction can alter interfacial structure, typically leading to destabilization and grain growth. This study investigates how chemical ordering influences grain boundary migration and stability during successive radiation events in CrCoNi. Using atomistic simulations, bicrystals were equilibrated to induce segregation-enhanced chemical order, followed by prolonged irradiation at 1100 K. Our results show that grain boundaries in random CrCoNi begin to migrate after only a few collision cascades, whereas those in the ordered alloy remain immobile until the chemical order is sufficiently disrupted. Single-cascade simulations reveal key mechanistic differences, where cascades near chemically ordered interfaces produce smaller damage volumes and reduced atomic displacement due to enhanced Frenkel pair combination within the cascade core. This limits both the residual defect population and the energetic driving force for interfacial rearrangement. Subsequent simulations of irradiated interfaces show that interstitial absorption induces a structural transition that modifies the segregation morphology at and near the grain boundary, demonstrating a dynamic coupling between ordering stability and defect evolution. These findings offer new insights into the role of local chemical order on defect-interface interactions under extreme conditions and highlight pathways for designing radiation-tolerant materials for next-generation nuclear systems.

Title: Thermodynamic Geometry Through Second Order Phase Transitions
Authors: Omer M. Basri, Oren Raz
Abstract: A common approach to quantify excess dissipation in slowly driven thermodynamic processes is through the use of a Riemannian metric on the space of control parameters, where optimal driving protocols follow geodesics. Near phase transitions, this geometric picture breaks down as the metric diverges and geodesics may cease to exist. Using Widom scaling, we analyze this framework for several universality classes and show that in some cases the thermodynamic length across the phase transition remains finite. We then demonstrate a numerical approach for computing minimal paths in such systems. We show that, in some regimes, the shortest path crosses the phase transition - even when alternative paths confined to a single phase exist.

Title: Piston-Like Information Engine I: Universal Features in Equilibrium
Authors: Rémi Goerlich, Gilad Pollack, Eli Flaxer, Saar Rahav, Yael Roichman
Abstract: The ability to measure the stochastic degrees of freedom of a thermal system enables the extraction of energy from an equilibrium heat bath. This is the underlying principle of Maxwell's demon and subsequent information engines. Here, we experimentally realize a microscopic information engine configured as a compressible piston containing a thermalized colloidal suspension. The particle positions are recorded to identify when a predefined region near the wall is empty, allowing the piston to compress the colloidal suspension without applying work on the system. We find that the stored compression energy is universally set by the probability of a positive measurement outcome, which in turn is controlled by parameters such as density and compression step size. We further demonstrate that mechanical work can be extracted during the decompression of the piston, thereby closing the engine's operating cycle.

Title: Order and shape dependence of mechanical relaxation in proliferating active matter
Authors: Jonas Isensee, Lukas Hupe, Philip Bittihn
Abstract: Collective dynamics in proliferating anisotropic particle systems arise from an interplay between growth, division, and mechanical interactions, often mediated by particle shape. In classical models of prolate, rod-like growth, flow-induced alignment and division geometry reinforce one another, leading to robust nematic order under confinement. Here we introduce a complementary regime by considering smooth convex particles whose geometry can be oblate for part or all of their growth cycle, creating a tunable competition between these two alignment mechanisms. Using agent-based simulations of elliptical and rounded-rectangular particles in both channel and open-domain geometries, we systematically vary the division aspect ratio to span regimes of cooperation and competition between ordering cues. We find that oblate growth can reverse classical flow-alignment, destabilize microdomain formation in intermediate regimes, and open up new regimes with modified microdomain dynamics in free expansion and sustained orientation dynamics in channel geometry. These findings are explained by an order- and shape-dependent mechanical relaxation interpretation that is supported by explicit measurements. This sheds new light on the available relaxation pathways and therefore provides key ingredients for effective descriptions of collective anisotropic proliferation dynamics.

Title: Admittance and critical current of nonreciprocal Josephson junctions
Authors: Tony Liu, Alex Levchenko
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium current response in diffusive superconductor-normal-metal-superconductor junctions subjected to a low-frequency AC voltage. Using a kinetic description based on the adiabatic motion of Andreev bound states, we derive a general expression for the admittance of a junction under a DC phase bias, formulated entirely in terms of the phase-dependent density of states induced by the proximity effect. A numerical solution of the full nonlinear Usadel equations that describe the dynamics of the junction is presented. The obtained results for the admittance and the Josephson current-phase relation apply to two-dimensional planar junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an in-plane Zeeman field, as well as to Josephson junctions formed with topological insulator surface states as the normal layer. The frequency dependence of the admittance captures the crossover between the hydrodynamic and collisionless regimes, distinguished by the relation between the drive frequency and the inelastic relaxation rate in the normal region.

Title: Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Two-dimensional Long-range Heisenberg Model
Authors: Dingyun Yao, Tianning Xiao, Zhijie Fan, Youjin Deng
Abstract: The introduction of decaying long-range (LR) interactions $1/r^{d+\sigma}$ has drawn persistent interest in understanding how system properties evolve with $\sigma$. The Sak's criterion and the extended Mermin-Wagner theorem have gained broad acceptance in predicting the critical and low-temperature (low-T) behaviors of such systems. We perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for the LR-Heisenberg model in two dimensions (2D) up to linear size $L=8192$, and show that, as long as for $\sigma \leq 2$, the system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking, via a single continuous phase transition, and develops a generic long-range order. We then introduce an LR simple random walk (LR-SRW) with the total walk length fixed at O($L^d$), satisfying the extensivity of statistical systems, and observe that the LR-SRW can faithfully characterize the low-T scaling behaviors of the LR-Heisenberg model in both 2D and 3D, as induced by Goldstone-mode fluctuations. Finally, based on insights from LR-SRW, we propose a general criterion for the phase transition and the low-T properties of LR statistical systems with continuous symmetry in any spatial dimension.

Title: Orientational lineage memory and mechanical ordering during diffusion-limited growth
Authors: Ilias-Marios Sarris, Ramin Golestianian, Philip Bittihn
Abstract: Growth and shape formation in crowded multicellular assemblies arise from the interplay of chemical gradients, single-cell expansion and mechanical interactions, making it essential to understand how these processes jointly shape collective organization. Using a particle-based model that resolves nutrient fields as well as cellular orientations and their inheritance, we investigate how orientational order emerges within expanding fronts whose morphology is set by nutrient limitation. We identify a transition in nematic order controlled by front morphology, with orientational memory influencing alignment only on one side of this transition. Under strong inheritance, orientational order varies non-monotonically: both thin active layers (fingering morphologies) and thick active layers (flat fronts) produce strong alignment, whereas intermediate cases are less ordered. Analysis of velocities, reorientation statistics, and stress anisotropies shows that this behavior reflects a shift from inheritance-dominated to mechanically driven alignment that overrides lineage memory. The resulting differences in front speed produce a fitness advantage of orientational memory only in the diffusion-limited, memory-dominated regime. These findings elucidate how nutrient supply, mechanical interactions, and single-cell expansion together shape self-organization during growth.

Title: Dilute Limit Coarsening with an Anisotropic Surface Tension
Authors: Arjun R. Anand, Melinda M. Andrews, Benjamin P. Vollmayr-Lee
Abstract: We investigate the impact of an anisotropic surface tension on the late-stage dilute phase separation dynamics, revisiting the seminal Lifshitz-Slyozov (LS) theory, which traditionally relies on the assumption of isotropic surface tension. Using a perturbative treatment for weak anisotropy, we demonstrate that although the characteristic $t^{1/3}$ drop growth law remains unchanged, the anisotropy causes a significant breakdown of morphological universality. Specifically, we calculate explicitly a one-parameter family of nonequilibrium drop shapes that depend on the scaled drop size. These shapes are close to the equilibrium Wulff shape, but the smaller drops are more spherical and the larger drops have an enhanced anisotropy in comparison to the Wulff shape. We also demonstrate that the the drop size distribution is modified from the isotropic LS distribution at second order in the anisotropy strength.

Title: Heterometallic spin-1/2 quantum magnet under hydrostatic pressure

Abstract: We investigate the properties of CuVOF$_4$(H$_2$O)$_6$$\cdot$H$_2$O, in which two different spin species, Cu(II) and V(IV), form antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 dimers with weak interdimer coupling provided via hydrogen bonding. Using radio-frequency susceptometry and electron-spin resonance (ESR), we show how the temperature-magnetic field spin-dimer phase diagram evolves as a function of applied hydrostatic pressure and correlate this with pressure-induced changes to the crystal structure. These results, coupled with pressure-tuned DFT calculations, confirm the prior prediction that the primary exchange interaction is mediated via an unusual mechanism in which the V(IV) ions provide considerable spin density to the oxygen that joins the two spins in each dimer and which lies along the Jahn-Teller axis of the Cu(II) ion. In addition, the dissimilarity in the spins that make up each dimer unit leads to a non-linear field dependence of the electronic energy levels as detected in the ESR measurements.

Title: Dimensionality and confinement reshape competition in cellular renewing active matter
Authors: Patrick Zimmer, Philip Bittihn, Yoav G. Pollack
Abstract: Cellular renewing active matter - assemblies of proliferating and apoptotic cells - underlies tissue homeostasis, morphogenesis, and clonal competition. Previous work in one-dimensional periodic systems identified a fitness advantage associated with rapid dead-cell clearance, an "opportunistic" competition mechanism. Extending this framework, we study two-dimensional cellular aggregates and show that dimensionality modifies the interplay between competition mechanisms for clones with different clearance rates: in 2D, opportunistic and homeostatic-pressure-based competition jointly shape clonal selection, to varying degrees. We then introduce an explicit circular confinement to probe how boundaries modulate this interplay. While opportunistic competition persists, distinct timescale-dependent behaviors emerge through weakened homeostatic-pressure-based competition near boundaries. Structural analysis reveals that confinement promotes tangential alignment and spatially heterogeneous homeostatic pressure, thereby reshaping competitive outcomes at tissue edges. Our study connects newly discovered competition mechanisms with more realistic biological contexts, highlighting how dimensionality and spatial constraints influence tissue structures and modulate competition in heterogeneous cell populations, with implications for tumor growth dynamics and tissue development.

Title: Geometric Regularity in Deterministic Sampling of Diffusion-based Generative Models
Authors: Defang Chen, Zhenyu Zhou, Can Wang, Siwei Lyu
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics of diffusion generative models: each simulated sampling trajectory along the gradient field lies within an extremely low-dimensional subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical boomerang shape, regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content. We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories, particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing deterministic numerical solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image generation performance, especially in regions with only 5 - 10 function evaluations.

Title: To the theory of helical waveguides
Authors: A.S. Yurkov
Abstract: It makes sense to consider a helical waveguide with a fine pitch approximately, replacing the turns with anisotropic conductivity: infinite along the turns and zero across them. This approach has been known for a long time, but calculation formulas within it have only been obtained for the case where the winding does not contain a dielectric core. This paper addresses this gap in the theory: calculation formulas are obtained for the case where the waveguide contains a dielectric with a certain permittivity and magnetic permeability. An equation determining the slowing factor is found, and a method for its numerical solution is proposed. Explicit formulas are obtained for the wave impedance.

Title: Nanoscale Magnonic Neurons
Authors: K. G. Fripp, A. V. Shytov, V. V. Kruglyak
Abstract: We use micromagnetic simulations to demonstrate neuron functionality of two-dimensional (2D) chiral magnonic resonators. Our design exploits nonlinear resonant scattering of spin waves propagating in a YIG medium from an edge mode of a permalloy nano-element. The reduced frequency and volume of the edge mode facilitate matching it to the YIG modes and give rise to their wide-angle scattering. As the amplitudes of the incident spin waves increase, the edge mode exhibits a positive nonlinear frequency shift. This shift leads to a complex frequency-dependent nonlinear variation of the amplitude and phase of spin waves scattered in different directions. We show that the scattered waves are strong enough to activate secondary neurons. This provides the connectivity required for combining our proposed neurons into 2D magnonic neural networks.

Title: Linearized instability of Couette flow in stress-power law fluids
Authors: Krishna Kaushik Yanamundra (1), Lorenzo Fusi (2) ((1) Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, TX, USA, (2) Dipartimento di Matematica e Informatica "U. Dini'', Università degli Studi di Firenze, 50134, Firenze, Italy)
Abstract: This paper examines the linearized stability of plane Couette flow for stress-power law fluids, which exhibit non-monotonic stress-strain rate behavior. The constitutive model is derived from a thermodynamic framework using a non-convex rate of dissipation potential. Under velocity boundary conditions, the system may admit three steady-state solutions. Linearized stability analysis reveals that the two solutions on ascending constitutive branches are unconditionally stable, while the solution on the descending branch is unconditionally unstable. For mixed traction-velocity boundary conditions, the base state is unique. Stability depends solely on whether the prescribed traction lies on an ascending (stable) or descending (unstable) branch of the constitutive curve. The results demonstrate that flow stability in these complex fluids is fundamentally governed by both boundary conditions and constitutive non-monotonicity.

Title: On-Chip Levitated Neon Particle Arrays for Robust and Scalable Electron Qubits
Authors: Sosuke Inui, Yinghe Qi, Yiming Xing, Charles Peretti, Dafei Jin, Wei Guo
Abstract: Electron-on-neon (eNe) qubits have recently emerged as a compelling platform for quantum computing, which combines the vacuum isolation advantages of trapped-ion qubits with the scalability of superconducting circuits. In this system, electrons are trapped in vacuum above a solid neon film deposited on superconducting microwave resonators, where they exhibit strong coupling to the resonators, coherence times of ~0.1 ms, and single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.97%. A central challenge, however, is the spontaneous binding of electrons to neon surface bumps. These bumps, originating from substrate roughness, vary in size: electrons on bumps of suitable sizes within the resonator can couple to microwave photons and function as qubits, whereas those on unfavorable bumps remain inactive yet contribute to background charge noise. Moreover, both the bump landscape and the sites where electrons bind differ from run to run, leading to irreproducible qubit characteristics that hinder scalability. To address this challenging issue, we present an on-chip magnetic-levitation architecture in which arrays of solid-neon microparticles are suspended above the processor chip to act as electron carriers. This design eliminates substrate effects while retaining strong qubit-resonator coupling and supporting inter-qubit connectivity. Our analysis further shows that the qubit transition frequency can be tuned across the gigahertz range and its anharmonicity can reach ~0.8 GHz by tuning the resonator bias voltage. Together, these features suggest a promising pathway toward robust, reproducible, and scalable eNe-based quantum computing.

Title: No boundary density matrix in elliptic de Sitter dS/$\mathbb{Z}_2$
Authors: Raphaël Dulac, Zixia Wei
Abstract: Elliptic de Sitter (dS) spacetime dS$/\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a non-time-orientable spacetime obtained by imposing an antipodal identification to global dS. Unlike QFT on global dS, whose vacuum state can be prepared by a no-boundary Euclidean path integral, the Euclidean elliptic dS does not define a wavefunction in the usual sense. We propose instead that the path integral on the Euclidean elliptic dS defines a no-boundary density matrix. As an explicit example, we study the free Dirac fermion CFT in two-dimensional elliptic dS and analytically compute the von Neumann and the Rényi entropies of this density matrix. The calculation reduces to correlation functions of vertex operators on non-orientable surfaces. As a by-product, we compute the time evolution of entanglement entropy following a crosscap quench in free Dirac fermion CFT. We also comment on a striking feature of free QFT in elliptic dS: its global Hilbert space is one-dimensional, wheres the Hilbert space associated to each observer is a nontrivial Fock space.

Title: New record in optical gain and room-temperature nanolasers in multiple wavelengths in 2D ErOCl single crystals

Abstract: Erbium-based materials have long been recognized for their important telecom-band applications, yet their widespread adoption in integrated optoelectronics has been hindered by two fundamental limitations: the difficulty in achieving high erbium density without concentration quenching which leads to small optical gain in doped materials, and the difficulty in fabricating a practical device with single crystal nanowires that demonstrated high optical gain previously1,2. Here, we overcome these limitations by synthesizing 2D single crystal ErOCl that has an Er density of 1.75*1022 cm-3. The high-quality single crystal material significantly reduces the density-related quenching effect that dominates in randomly doped materials with high Er concentration. This results in a record optical gain coefficient over 1500 dB/cm at 1536 nm band, at least larger by an order of magnitude than the previous gain record in Er materials. Leveraging this exceptional gain medium, we demonstrate room-temperature continuous-wave lasing operation by integrating with a photonic crystal microcavity, achieving a record-low threshold of 7 {\mu}W with the most compact size of any Er-based lasers. Furthermore, the unique Stark splitting characteristics of ErOCl provide optical gain in three wavelength bands and lead to lasing in these wavelengths by engineering the cavity. This is the first time that optical gain has been shown in three different wavelength bands in Er materials, together with the smallest size of laser cavity, could have many important applications in on-chip sensing and optical communication.

Title: Braided QM and Majorana qubits at third root of unity: a color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebra framework
Authors: Zhanna Kuznetsova, Francesco Toppan
Abstract: We introduce color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebras graded by the abelian groups $Z_3^2$, $Z_2^p\times Z_3^2$ for $p=1,2,3$, and investigate the properties of their associated multi-particle quantum paraoscillators. In the Rittenberg-Wyler's color Lie (super)algebras framework the above abelian groups are the simplest ones which induce mixed brackets interpolating commutators and anticommutators. These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.

Title: Generalized Boltzmann-Gibbs Distribution and the Electronic Partition Function Paradox
Authors: Leandro Lyra Braga Dognini
Abstract: This paper generalizes the entropy maximization problem leading to the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution through the nonadditive entropy $S_{q,s}(p)=k_{s}\sum^{W}_{i\geq1}p_{i}\ln_{q}1/p_{i}$, $q\in(0,1)$, which is a rescaled version of $S_{q}$ \cite{Tsallis1988} by a factor $k_{s}=k^{q}(e_{\max}/(W^{\sigma}-1))^{1-q}$, $\sigma>0$, varying according to the underlying energy spectrum and satisfying $k_{s}\rightarrow k$ (Boltzmann constant) as $q\rightarrow 1$. The maximization problem based on $S_{q,s}$ is used to derive analytical generalizations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution for the case of an energy spectrum that uniformly approaches a continuous, unbounded limit with a common degeneracy, the harmonic oscillator, and the one-dimensional box. Furthermore, I demonstrate that this generalized problem yields a two-tier model with finite structural parameters $\beta$ for the hydrogen atom in free space and, therefore, can be used to circumvent the Electronic Partition Function Paradox and obtain a family of well-defined thermodynamic behaviors indexed by $q\in(0,1)$. In particular, for $q=0.5$, the specific heat of the free hydrogen atom becomes the Boltzmann constant. Finally, it is shown that all the limiting processes involved in these four cases lead naturally to the same definition of the scale factor $k_{s}$ that characterizes $S_{q,s}$ (``s'' stands, in this context, for ``spectrum'') in order to grant finite, smooth, macroscopically observable temperature values that are related to the entropic functional by $\partial S_{q,s}/\partial U=1/\vert T\vert^{q}_{\pm}$, which recovers $\partial S_{BG}/\partial U=1/T$ \cite{Clausius1865} as $q\rightarrow1$.

Title: Quantum ramp secret sharing from Haar scrambling
Authors: Kiran Adhikari
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, assessing benchmarking protocols, and even investigating exotic black hole models. During quantum information scrambling, localized quantum information disperses across the entire system, hiding from the observers who can only access part of it. On the other side, we have a fundamental cryptographic primitive called secret-sharing schemes, where a dealer shares a quantum secret with a group of parties, such that any subset of parties above a specific threshold size can reconstruct it. In this paper, we demonstrate that two protocols, Haar scrambling, which serves as a baseline for other scrambling techniques, and quantum secret sharing, are indeed equivalent. The scheme one gets out of this is of a ramp secret-sharing nature rather than a threshold scheme. We expect this because of the inherent randomness present in Haar unitaries. Moreover, by varying the purity of the initial states, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain all possible types of ramp secret-sharing schemes. Furthermore, utilizing complexity theoretic arguments, we argue that the protocol can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in polynomial time. Finally, we explore potential applications, ranging from security implications for distributed quantum networks to cryptography in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, and draw insights for fundamental physics, such as many-body physics and quantum black holes.

Title: Symmetries at the origin of hierarchical emergence
Authors: Fernando E. Rosas
Abstract: Many systems of interest exhibit nested emergent layers with their own rules and regularities, and our knowledge about them seems naturally organised around these levels. This paper proposes that this type of hierarchical emergence arises as a result of underlying symmetries. By combining principles from information theory, group theory, and statistical mechanics, one finds that dynamical processes that are equivariant with respect to a symmetry group give rise to emergent macroscopic levels organised into a hierarchy determined by the subgroups of the symmetry. The same symmetries happen to also shape Bayesian beliefs, yielding hierarchies of abstract belief states that can be updated autonomously at different levels of resolution. These results are illustrated in Hopfield networks and Ehrenfest diffusion, showing that familiar macroscopic quantities emerge naturally from their symmetries. Together, these results suggest that symmetries provide a fundamental mechanism for emergence and support a structural correspondence between objective and epistemic processes, making feasible inferential problems that would otherwise be computationally intractable.

Title: Exact quantum dynamics of Fermi--Hubbard systems using the Gaussian phase-space representation with diffusion gauges
Authors: F Rousse, M Fasi, A Dmytryshyn, M Gulliksson, J F Corney, M Ogren
Abstract: We use the Gaussian Phase-Space Representation to solve the real-time dynamic of interacting fermions in 1D, 2D, and 3D systems. The method is exact up to a spiking point, which represents a limit on the practical simulation time. The spiking can be delayed, and the practical simulation time extended, by adjusting the gauges of the representation, resulting in different equivalent stochastic differential equations. Here, we work on the so-called diffusion gauge and propose an algorithm to find efficiently new implementations of the noise terms. Compared with our initial results [F. Rousse \textit{et al.} 2024, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. \textbf{57}, 015303], the new method achieves a significantly longer practical simulation time and can be applied to significantly larger systems.

Title: A Classification of Invertible Stabilizer Codes
Authors: Roman Geiko. Georgii Shuklin
Abstract: We develop a framework for the classification of invertible translation-invariant stabilizer codes modulo condensation and stabilization with simple codes. We introduce generalizations of the Pauli groups of local unitaries for quantum systems of qudits on cubic lattices and analyze stabilizer Hamiltonians whose terms are chosen from these groups. We define invertible stabilizer codes to be ground states of stabilizer Hamiltonians with trivial topological charges and completely classify them in any spatial dimension in terms of relative L-theory groups. In particular, we show that the group of equivalence classes of such codes in three spatial dimensions is isomorphic to the Witt group of abelian topological orders in two spatial dimensions. Additionally, we propose the spectrum of the relative L-theory as a representative of the generalized cohomology theory corresponding to the invertible stabilizer states.

Title: Lorentz violation and momentum-space geometric phases
Authors: Alan Kostelecky, Ralf Lehnert, Marco Schreck, Babak Seradjeh
Abstract: Geometric phases can manifest when a relativistic quantum particle moves cyclically along a loop in parameter space. The phase can be affected by the presence of a background field and can be accompanied by nontrivial topological features. The appearance of adiabatic geometric phases in momentum space is demonstrated for a Lorentz-violating Weyl fermion, where the role of the background is played by the coefficients for Lorentz violation. As explicit examples, the Berry curvature and the first Chern number are derived for two cases with large Lorentz violation, one incorporating CPT violation and one preserving CPT symmetry. Some alternative topological invariants are also obtained. In certain scenarios with large Lorentz violation, the physical vacuum is associated with a topological phase.

By coherently controlling the collective interference phase, the system switches from single-photon blockade to high-purity multiphoton bundle emission, unveiling a hierarchical structure of photon correlations dictated by atom-number parity and cavity detuning. The scaling of photon population identifies the transition between superradiant and subradiant regimes, while parity- and phase-dependent spin correlations elucidate the microscopic interference processes enabling coherent multiphoton generation. This work establishes a unified framework connecting cooperative atomic interactions to controllable nonclassical photon statistics and introduces a distinct interference-enabled mechanism that provides a practical route toward high-fidelity multiphoton sources in scalable cavity QEDs.

Title: Data-Driven Learnability Transition of Measurement-Induced Entanglement
Authors: Dongheng Qian, Jing Wang
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) captures how local measurements generate long-range quantum correlations and drive dynamical phase transitions in many-body systems. Yet estimating MIE experimentally remains challenging: direct evaluation requires extensive post-selection over measurement outcomes, raising the question of whether MIE is accessible with only polynomial resources. We address this challenge by reframing MIE detection as a data-driven learning problem that assumes no prior knowledge of state preparation. Using measurement records alone, we train a neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict the uncertainty metric for MIE--the gap between upper and lower bounds of the average post-measurement bipartite entanglement. Applied to random circuits with one-dimensional all-to-all connectivity and two-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupling, our method reveals a learnability transition with increasing circuit depth: below a threshold, the uncertainty is small and decreases with polynomial measurement data and model parameters, while above it the uncertainty remains large despite increasing resources. We further verify this transition experimentally on current noisy quantum devices, demonstrating its robustness to realistic noise. These results highlight the power of data-driven approaches for learning MIE and delineate the practical limits of its classical learnability.

Title: Circular current induced by angular dynamics in swarmalator populations
Authors: Hyun Keun Lee, Hyunsuk Hong
Abstract: We propose a modified swarmalator model that generates collective rotational currents in phase synchronization. Our approach builds on the original swarmalator model [4], introducing a key modification: the phase-dependent terms in the spatial dynamics are replaced with a simpler driving term that depends on both the phase and a specified origin. We investigate the dynamics of this model through extensive numerical simulations. When the origin is fixed, spiral motions of synchronized and clustered swarmalators emerge from a finite fraction of random initial conditions, resulting in collective currents. To prevent the unrealistic divergence of these spirals, we introduce a dynamic origin, defined as the center of the swarmalators' positions. With this dynamic origin, the system evolves into rotating collective currents, where synchronized swarmalators form stable circular patterns. In both the fixed and dynamic origin cases, we also observe no-current states, in which synchronized swarmalators aggregate near the origin. Finally, we find that the formation of collective currents can be facilitated by tuning the phase variables either at initialization or during the system's evolution.

Title: Dynamics due to competitive flip cycles in active Potts models
Authors: Hiroshi Noguchi
Abstract: Nonequilibrium spatiotemporal patterns have been extensively studied. However, a single oscillator or cyclic loop of states is typically employed at each site in theories and simulations. Here, we investigated how competition among multiple identical cyclic loops at each site alters patterns. We simulated active Potts models with standard Potts interactions between neighboring sites in two-dimensional square lattices. When multiple three-state cycles exist in state flips, such as in octahedral and square-antiprism networks, all types of spiral waves comprising the three states are formed simultaneously at high flip energies. However, at lower energies, only one or a few types emerge and switch stochastically into different types. At even lower energies, cyclic changes in single-state dominant homogeneous phases emerge [homogeneous cycling (HC) mode]. At intermediate flip energies, the spiral wave and HC modes temporally coexist in small systems but do not switch between each other in large systems. Conversely, when multiple four-state cycles exist in six-state and cubic networks, one state remains dominant for the entire range of flip energies, whereas the other states occasionally form domains at intermediate flip energies. Therefore, the number of spatially coexisting states can be controlled using flip networks and energies.

Title: Effects of thermal annealing and film thickness on the structural and optical properties of indium-tin-oxide thin films
Authors: Ding Xu, Wen Zhou, Yuxin Du, Junying Zhang, Wei Zhang, Jiangjing Wang
Abstract: Indium-tin oxide (ITO) has been leveraged as a crucial functional layer in the optoelectronic frameworks, such as non-volatile color display thin films based on the ITO/phase-change material (PCM)/ITO/reflective metal multilayer structures on a silicon substrate. In addition to non-volatile color tuning by PCMs, phase transition of ITO may pose a substantial impact on display performances. Yet, a comprehensive colormap of ITO thin films as functions of annealing temperature and film thickness is missing. In this work, we systematically investigate properties of ITO films based on X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry measurements. We provide a colormap of the ITO/platinum/silicon structure in terms of the annealing temperature (150-350 °C) and thickness (5-100 nm) for the non-volatile color display, and we observe strong color changes under 250 °C annealing treatment for the 50-nm and 100-nm-thick ITO films. We suggest that the intrinsic change in colors of the ITO functional thin-film layers should also be taken into account, when the PCM-based reconfigurable color devices are used in practice.

Title: QuantumCanvas: A Multimodal Benchmark for Visual Learning of Atomic Interactions
Authors: Can Polat, Erchin Serpedin, Mustafa Kurban, Hasan Kurban
Abstract: Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities. Dataset and model implementations are available at this https URL.

Title: Fermi-liquid view of viscosity in cold and dense nucleon matter
Authors: Jianing Li, Weiyao Ke, Jin Hu
Abstract: We develop a framework to calculate transport properties in cold, dense relativistic quasiparticle system within the Fermi-liquid theory at the mean-field level. Building on our previous study [Phys. Rev. C 111, 044904 (2025)], we start from the linearized relativistic Boltzmann equation tailored to quasiparticles with medium-dependent dispersion relation and implement Landau matching conditions, proving that the bulk viscosity is manifestly nonnegative. A low-temperature expansion then yields leading-order ($T/\mu^*$) expressions for the shear ($\eta$) and bulk ($\zeta$) viscosities, where the behavior $\zeta/\eta \propto (T/\mu^*)^4$ in the degenerate regime is found to be robust against quasiparticle mass correction. We couple the kinetic framework to a Walecka-type mean-field equation of state and compute $\eta$ and $\zeta$ for cold, dense nucleon matter. The transport properties of nucleonic matter in the degenerate regime can be relevant for intermediate beam-energy nuclear experiments.

Title: Antibunching in locally driven dissipative Lieb lattices
Authors: Alex Ferrier, Michał Matuszewski, Piotr Deuar, Marzena H. Szymańska
Abstract: In Lieb lattices, geometric frustration and destructive interference of hopping cancels the occupation of certain sites, leading to flat-band physics. Here, we show numerically how, in the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard (DDBH) model arranged into Lieb lattices and related geometries, specific localised driving schemes can repurpose this interference to generate enhanced antibunching via a mechanism similar to the so-called unconventional photon blockade. Stochastic simulations using the positive-P method allow us to calculate occupations and second order correlations exactly for extended lattices. We use this to optimise the parameters for the possible observation of this effect in polariton micropillar experiments. This work demonstrates the possibility of using localised driving and interference effects to generate non-trivial quantum correlations in open quantum lattice systems.

Title: Multi-pole solitons and breathers with spatially periodic modulation induced by the helicoidal spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Cui-Cui Ding, Qin Zhou, B. A. Malomed
Abstract: We report analytical solutions for diverse multi-pole (MP) soliton and breather states in spatially inhomogeneous binary Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with the helicoidally shaped spin-orbit coupling (SOC), including MP stripe solitons on zero background, MP beating stripe solitons on a nonzero plane-wave background, as well as MP beating stripe solitons and MP breathers on periodic backgrounds. The results indicate that modulation effects produced by the helicoidal SOC not only induce stripe patterns in MP solitons, but also generate the spatially-periodic background for the MP beating stripe solitons and breathers. An asymptotic analysis reveals curved trajectories with a logarithmically increasing soliton/breather separation for these MP excitations, fundamentally distinguishing them from periodic trajectories of bound-state solitons/breathers or straight trajectories of conventional multi-soliton/breather sets. With complex periodic structures in individual components, the total density distribution is nonperiodic, due to their configurations which are out-of-phase with respect to the two components. We further examine several degenerate structures of MP solitons and breathers under varying SOC and spectral parameters. Numerical simulations validate the analytical results and demonstrate stability of these MP excitations. These findings may facilitate deeper understanding of soliton/breather interactions beyond conventional multi-soliton systems and bound-state complexes in SOC BEC.

Title: LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Curation and Expansion of Metal-Organic Frameworks Database
Authors: Honghui Kim, Dohoon Kim, Jihan Kim
Abstract: Metal-organic framework (MOF) databases have grown rapidly through experimental deposition and large-scale literature extraction, but recent analyses show that nearly half of their entries contain substantial structural errors. These inaccuracies propagate through high-throughput screening and machine-learning workflows, limiting the reliability of data-driven MOF discovery. Correcting such errors is exceptionally difficult because true repairs require integrating crystallographic files, synthesis descriptions, and contextual evidence scattered across the literature. Here we introduce LitMOF, a large language model-driven multi-agent framework that validates crystallographic information directly from the original literature and cross-validates it with database entries to repair structural errors. Applying LitMOF to the experimental MOF database (the CSD MOF Subset), we constructed LitMOF-DB, a curated set 118,464 computation-ready structures, including corrections of 69% (6,161 MOFs) of the invalid MOFs in the latest CoRE MOF database. Additionally, the system uncovered 12,646 experimentally reported MOFs absent from existing resources, substantially expanding the known experimental design space. This work establishes a scalable pathway toward self-correcting scientific databases and a generalizable paradigm for LLM-driven curation in materials science.

Title: Transient laser-induced periodic surface structures revealed by time-resolved EUV diffuse scattering

Abstract: The formation of permanent laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) on solid surfaces under impulsive laser irradiation above the damage threshold has been subject of extensive research. We demonstrate the formation of transient surface displacement patterns under femtosecond laser irradiation at fluences well below this threshold. Time-resolved extreme ultraviolet scattering measurements reveal distinct reciprocal-space features similar to those observed for permanent LIPSS but dissipating on the hundreds-of-picoseconds time scale. We show that the transient surface displacement patterns responsible for these features are produced via thermal expansion by the spatial modulation of absorbed laser intensity caused by scattering of the laser radiation by surface roughness and present a model accounting for the experimental observations. We suggest that our experiment revealed a universal phenomenon that will be observed on any strongly absorbing material under ultrafast laser irradiation.

Title: Effects of Zero-Point Motion in the High Harmonic Generation Spectrum of Solids
Authors: Aday Cárdenas, David N. Purschke, Graham G. Brown, Pablo San-Jose, Rui E.F. Silva, Álvaro Jiménez-Galán
Abstract: The interpretation of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids typically relies on phenomenological dephasing times far shorter than what is expected from microscopic scattering processes. Here we show that zero-point fluctuations associated with optical phonons naturally suppress long-range electronic coherences and generate clean harmonic spectra without introducing ad-hoc decoherence parameters. Using a 1D semiconductor composed of two distinct sites per unit cell and realistic phonon amplitudes, we demonstrate that random per-site optical-phonon jitter reproduces the spectral sharpening typically attributed to ultrafast $T_2$ dephasing. In contrast, acoustic phonons and local strain, whose distortions are correlated over nanometer scales, produce negligible spectral cleaning. We further show that such long-range site coherence leads to carrier-envelope-phase-dependent effects in the HHG spectrum driven by long pulses, but these effects collapse once optical-phonon-induced decoherence is included. Our results (i) identify optical zero-point motion as a key mechanism governing coherence in solid-state HHG, (ii) demonstrate that it can be qualitatively modeled in periodic solids through site-distance-dependent dephasing, and (iii) suggest that CEP-resolved measurements can probe electronic coherence lengths and atomic fluctuations in crystalline materials.

Title: The effect of Coulomb interactions on relic neutrino detection via beta decaying impurities in (semi)metals
Authors: Karel van der Marck, Vadim Cheianov
Abstract: Measuring the electron neutrino mass is a long-standing objective and requires a high energy resolution of certain $\beta$-decay experiments, as well as a visible cosmic neutrino background ($C{\nu}B$) spectrum. Many quantum mechanical and chemical effects could potentially impair the required resolution/visibility, e.g., the Coulomb interactions between the electrons in the \b{eta}-decaying impurity and in the solid-state environment. We analyze the effect when hybridization is suppressed completely using a dielectric spacer, and also when hybridization is present up to the lowest nontrivial order in perturbation theory.

Title: Mofasa: A Step Change in Metal-Organic Framework Generation
Authors: Vaidotas Simkus, Anders Christensen, Steven Bennett, Ian Johnson, Mark Neumann, James Gin, Jonathan Godwin, Benjamin Rhodes
Abstract: Mofasa is an all-atom latent diffusion model with state-of-the-art performance for generating Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). These are highly porous crystalline materials used to harvest water from desert air, capture carbon dioxide, store toxic gases and catalyse chemical reactions. In recognition of their value, the development of MOFs recently received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In many ways, MOFs are well-suited for exploiting generative models in chemistry: they are rationally-designable materials with a large combinatorial design space and strong structure-property couplings. And yet, to date, a high performance generative model has been lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce Mofasa, a general-purpose latent diffusion model that jointly samples positions, atom-types and lattice vectors for systems as large as 500 atoms. Mofasa avoids handcrafted assembly algorithms common in the literature, unlocking the simultaneous discovery of metal nodes, linkers and topologies. To help the scientific community build on our work, we release MofasaDB, an annotated library of hundreds of thousands of sampled MOF structures, along with a user-friendly web interface for search and discovery: this https URL .

Title: Granite sliding on granite: friction, wear rates, surface topography, and the scale-dependence of rate-state effects
Authors: Sergey V. Sukhomlinov, Martin H. Müser, B.N.J. Persson
Abstract: We study tribological granite-granite contacts as a model for tectonic faulting, combining experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. The high friction in this system is not dominated by particulate wear or plowing, as frequently assumed, but by cold welding within plastically deformed asperity junctions. We base this conclusion on the observation that wear is repeatedly high after cleaning contacts but decreases as gouge accumulates, while friction shows the opposite trend. Moreover, adding water reduces wear by a factor of ten but barely decreases friction. Thermal and rate-dependent effects - central to most earthquake models-are negligible: friction remains unchanged between -40°C and 20°C, across abrupt velocity steps, and after hours of stationary contact. The absence of rate-state effects in our macroscopic samples is rationalized by the scale-dependence of pre-slip. The evolution of surface topography shows that quartz grains become locally smooth, with height spectra isotropic for wavelength below 10 microns but anisotropic at longer wavelengths, similar to natural faults. The resulting gouge particles have the usual characteristic sizes near 100 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of a rigid, amorphous silica tip sliding on {\alpha}-quartz reproduce not only similar friction coefficients near unity but also other experimentally observed features, including stress-introduced transitions to phases observed in post-mortem faults, as well as theoretical estimates of local flash temperatures. Additionally, they reveal a marked decrease of interfacial shear strength above 600°C. The overall correspondence between experiments, simulations, theory, and field observations indicates that our model system captures essential aspects of rock friction.

Title: Storage capacity of perceptron with variable selection
Authors: Yingying Xu, Masayuki Ohzeki, Yoshiyuki Kabashima
Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to distinguish genuine structure from chance correlations in high-dimensional data. In this work, we address this issue for the perceptron, a foundational model of neural computation. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the pattern load $\alpha$ and the variable selection ratio $\rho$ for which a simple perceptron can perfectly classify $P = \alpha N$ random patterns by optimally selecting $M = \rho N$ variables out of $N$ variables. While the Cover--Gardner theory establishes that a random subset of $\rho N$ dimensions can separate $\alpha N$ random patterns if and only if $\alpha < 2\rho$, we demonstrate that optimal variable selection can surpass this bound by developing a method, based on the replica method from statistical mechanics, for enumerating the combinations of variables that enable perfect pattern classification. This not only provides a quantitative criterion for distinguishing true structure in the data from spurious regularities, but also yields the storage capacity of associative memory models with sparse asymmetric couplings.

Title: Testing Transformer Learnability on the Arithmetic Sequence of Rooted Trees
Authors: Alessandro Breccia, Federica Gerace, Marco Lippi, Gabriele Sicuro, Pierluigi Contucci
Abstract: We study whether a Large Language Model can learn the deterministic sequence of trees generated by the iterated prime factorization of the natural numbers. Each integer is mapped into a rooted planar tree and the resulting sequence $ \mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$ defines an arithmetic text with measurable statistical structure. A transformer network (the GPT-2 architecture) is trained from scratch on the first $10^{11}$ elements to subsequently test its predictive ability under next-word and masked-word prediction tasks. Our results show that the model partially learns the internal grammar of $\mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$, capturing non-trivial regularities and correlations. This suggests that learnability may extend beyond empirical data to the very structure of arithmetic.

Title: Random matrix perspective on probabilistic error cancellation
Authors: Leonhard Moske, Pedro Ribeiro, Tomaž Prosen, Sergiy Denysov, Karol Życzkowski, David J. Luitz
Abstract: Probabilistic error cancellation is an attempt to reverse the effect of dissipative noise channels on quantum computers by applying unphysical channels after the execution of a quantum algorithm on noisy hardware. We investigate on general grounds the properties of such unphysical quantum channels by considering a random matrix ensemble modeling noisy quantum algorithms. We show that the complex spectra of denoiser channels inherit their structure from random Lindbladians. Additional structure imposed by the locality of noise channels of the quantum computer emerges in terms of a hierarchy of timescales.

Title: Influence of interstitial Li on the electronic properties of Li$_{x}$CsPbI$_{3}$ for photovoltaic and battery applications
Authors: Wei Wei, Julian Gebhardt, Daniel F. Urban, Christian Elsässer
Abstract: The integrated device of a perovskite solar cell with a Li-ion battery is an innovative solution for decentralized energy storage in smart electronic devices. In this study, we examine the stability of Li ions intercalated in a CsPbI$_3$ perovskite and their effect on the electronic structure of Li$_x$CsPbI$_3$ compounds using first-principles density functional theory. Our simulations demonstrate that the insertion of Li at concentrations up to $x$ = 1 into CsPbI$_3$ is energetically possible. Moreover, we identify that the distortion of the Pb-I octahedra has the strongest impact on the change in the electronic band gap. Specifically, an increase in the amount of intercalated Li causes larger structural distortions, which in turn lead to an increasing band gap as function of the Li content.

Title: The algebraic spin liquid in the SU(6) Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice
Authors: Dániel Vörös, Kránitz Péter, Karlo Penc
Abstract: We explore the Dirac spin liquid (DSL) as a candidate for the ground state of the Mott insulating phase of fermions with six flavors on the Kagome lattice, particularly focusing on realizations using $^{173}$Yb atoms in optical lattices. Using mean-field theory and variational Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the Dirac spin liquid (DSL) has the lowest variational energy among SU(6) symmetry-preserving trial wave functions with a periodicity of a 12-site unit cell, as well as uniform chiral states with larger unit cells. It remains a local minimum even when small second-nearest neighbor and ring exchange interactions are introduced. To characterize the DSL, we calculate the static and dynamic structure factor of the Gutzwiller projected wavefunction and compare it with mean-field calculations. The static structure factor shows triangular-shaped plateaus around the $\mathrm{K}$ points in the extended Brillouin zone, with small peaks at the corners of these plateaus. The dynamical structure factor consists of a gapless continuum of fractionalized excitations. Our study also presents several complementary results, including bounds for the ground state energy, methods for calculating three-site ring exchange expectations in the projective mean field, the boundary of ferromagnetic states, and the non-topological nature of flat bands in the DSL band structure.

Title: A resonant valence bond spin liquid in the dilute limit of doped frustrated Mott insulators
Authors: Cecilie Glittum, Antonio Štrkalj, Dharmalingam Prabhakaran, Paul A. Goddard, Cristian D. Batista, Claudio Castelnovo
Abstract: Ideas about resonant valence bond liquids and spin-charge separation have led to key concepts in physics such as quantum spin liquids, emergent gauge symmetries, topological order, and fractionalisation. Despite extensive efforts to demonstrate the existence of a resonant valence bond phase in the Hubbard model that originally motivated the concept, a definitive realisation has yet to be achieved. Here we present a solution to this long-standing problem by uncovering a resonant valence bond phase exhibiting spin-charge separation in realistic Hamiltonians. We show analytically that this ground state emerges in the dilute-doping limit of a half-filled Mott insulator on corner-sharing tetrahedral lattices with frustrated hopping, in the absence of exchange interactions. We confirm numerically that the results extend to finite exchange interactions, finite-sized systems and finite dopant density. Although much attention has been devoted to the emergence of unconventional states from geometrically frustrated interactions, our work demonstrates that kinetic energy frustration in doped Mott insulators may be essential for stabilising robust, topologically ordered states in real materials.

Title: Mechanical hysterons with tunable interactions of general sign
Authors: Joseph D. Paulsen
Abstract: Hysterons are elementary units of hysteresis that underlie many complex behaviors of non-equilibrium matter. Because models of interacting hysterons can describe disordered matter, this suggests that artificial systems could respond to mechanical inputs in precise and targeted ways. Specifying the properties of hysterons and their interactions could thus be a general method for realizing arbitrary non-equilibrium behaviors. Elastic structures including slender beams, creased sheets, and shells are clear candidates for artificial hysterons, but complete control of their interactions has seemed impractical or impossible. Here we report a mechanical hysteron composed of rigid bars and linear springs, which has controllable properties and tunable interactions of general sign that can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. We derive a mapping from the system parameters to the hysteron properties, and we show how collective behaviors of multiple hysterons can be targeted by adjusting geometric parameters on the fly. By transforming an abstract hysteron model into a physical design platform, our work demonstrates a route toward designed materials that can sense, compute, and respond to their mechanical environment.

Title: Superconductivity and charge-density-wave in the Holstein model on the Penrose Lattice
Authors: Lu Liu, Zi-Xiang Li, Fan Yang
Abstract: The exotic quantum states emerging in the quasicrystal (QC) have attracted extensive interest because of various properties absent in the crystal. In this paper, we systematically study the Holstein model at half filling on a prototypical structure of QC, namely rhombic Penrose lattice, aiming at investigating the superconductivity (SC) and other intertwined ordering arising from the interplay between quasiperiodicity and electron-phonon ({\it e}-ph) interaction. Through unbiased sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal the salient features of the ground-state phase diagram. Distinct from the results on bipartite periodic lattices at half filling, SC is dominant in a large parameter regime on the Penrose lattice. When {\it e}-ph coupling is sufficiently strong, charge-density-wave order appears and strongly suppresses the SC. The strongest SC emerges at intermediate {\it e}-ph coupling strength and pronounced pairing fluctuation exists above the SC transition temperature. The strong pairing originates from the cooperative effects of unique lattice structure and macroscopically degenerate confined states at Fermi energy which uniquely exist on the Penrose lattice. Moreover, we demonstrate the forbidden ladders substantially suppress the phase coherence of SC. Our unbiased numerical results suggest that Penrose lattice is a potential platform to realize strong SC pairing, providing a promising avenue to searching for relatively high-$T_c$ SC dominantly induced by {\it e}-ph coupling.

Title: The single edge notch fracture test for viscoelastic elastomers
Authors: Farhad Kamarei, Fabio Sozio, Oscar Lopez-Pamies
Abstract: Making use of the Griffith criticality condition recently introduced by Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies (Extreme Mechanics Letters 58: 101944, 2023), this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the single edge notch fracture test for viscoelastic elastomers. The results -- comprised of a combination of a parametric study and direct comparisons with experiments -- reveal how the non-Gaussian elasticity, the nonlinear viscosity, and the intrinsic fracture energy of elastomers interact and govern when fracture nucleates from the pre-existing crack in these tests. The results also serve to quantify the limitations of existing analyses, wherein viscous effects and the actual geometries of the pre-existing cracks and the specimens are neglected.

Title: Polarons and bipolarons in Rydberg-dressed extended Bose-Hubbard model
Authors: G. A. Domínguez-Castro, L. Santos, L. A. Peña Ardila
Abstract: Impurities immersed in hard-core Bose gases offer exciting opportunities to explore polaron and bipolaron physics. We investigate the ground state properties of a single and a pair of impurities throughout the superfluid and insulating (charge density wave) phases of the bosonic environment. In the superfluid phase, the impurity exhibits polaron-like behavior, forming a dressed quasiparticle. In contrast, in the insulating phase, the impurity regains its particle-like character, moving through a potential landscape shaped by the charge density wave order. Moreover, we show that two impurities can form a bound state even in the absence of an explicit impurity-impurity coupling. We establish the stability of this bound state within both the superfluid and insulating phases. Our results offer valuable insights for ongoing lattice polaron experiments with ultracold gases.

Title: Enhancement of spin Hall angle by an order of magnitude via Cu intercalation in MoS$_2$/CoFeB heterostructures
Authors: Abhisek Mishra, Pritam Das, Rupalipriyadarsini Chhatoi, Soubhagya Dash, Shubhransu Sahoo, Kshitij Singh Rathore, Pil-Ryung Cha, Seung-Cheol Lee, Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Subhankar Bedanta
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a novel class of quantum materials with significant potential in spintronics, optoelectronics, valleytronics, and opto-valleytronics. TMDs exhibit strong spin-orbit coupling, enabling efficient spin-charge interconversion, which makes them ideal candidates for spin-orbit torque-driven spintronic devices. In this study, we investigated the spin-to-charge conversion through ferromagnetic resonance in MoS$_2$/Cu/CoFeB heterostructures with varying Cu spacer thicknesses. The conversion efficiency, quantified by the spin Hall angle, was enhanced by an order of magnitude due to Cu intercalation. Magneto-optic Kerr effect microscopy confirmed that Cu did not significantly modify the magnetic domains, indicating its effectiveness in decoupling MoS$_2$ from CoFeB. This decoupling preserves the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of MoS$_2$ by mitigating the exchange interaction with CoFeB, as proximity to localized magnetization can alter the electronic structure and SOC. First-principles calculations revealed that Cu intercalation notably enhances the spin Berry curvature and spin Hall conductivity, contributing to the increased spin Hall angle. This study demonstrates that interface engineering of ferromagnet/TMD-based heterostructures can achieve higher spin-to-charge conversion efficiencies, paving the way for advancements in spintronic applications.

Title: Strong and weak wave turbulence regimes in Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Ying Zhu, Giorgio Krstulovic, Sergey Nazarenko
Abstract: When a turbulent Bose-Einstein condensate is driven out-of-equilibrium at a scale much smaller than the system size, nonlinear wave interactions transfer particles towards large scales in an inverse cascade process. In this work, we study numerically wave turbulence in a three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate in forced and dissipated inverse cascade settings. We observe that when the forcing rate increases, thereby increasing the particle flux, the turbulence spectrum gradually transitions from the weak-wave Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade to a critical balance state characterized by a range of scales with balanced linear and nonlinear dynamic timescales. Further forcing increases lead to a coherent condensate component superimposed with Bogoliubov-type acoustic turbulence. The role of vortices in such a strongly forced state is marginal, which makes this new state very different from the strongly turbulent state composed of a tangle of quantized vortex lines. We then use our predictions and numerical data to formulate a new out-of-equilibrium equation of state for the 3D inverse cascade.

Title: Spectral Bifurcation and Anomalous Supercurrent in Dissipative Topological Insulator-based Josephson Junctions
Authors: Ardamon Sten, Paramita Dutta, Sudeep Kumar Ghosh
Abstract: The interplay between topological protection and dissipation constitutes a critical frontier in the realization of hybrid quantum devices. Here, we investigate the transport signatures in a dissipative topological insulator-based Josephson junction, a platform that directly probes the competition between quantum coherence and loss. We model dissipation by coupling a `lossy' metallic lead to the junction, described effectively by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian derived using the Lindblad formalism. We observe that the junction exhibits an asymmetric complex Andreev spectrum, where the imaginary energy component imposes a finite lifetime on the quasi-bound states. Furthermore, beyond specific phase intervals, the real component of the spectrum bifurcates: one branch merges with the continuum, while the other penetrates just below the superconducting gap. Crucially, the characteristic zero-energy crossing shifts away from $\phi=\pi$ and acquires a non-zero imaginary component; consequently, the associated Majorana bound states acquire a finite lifetime, signaling a loss of robustness against dissipation. Finally, this spectral asymmetry drives an anomalous supercurrent, manifested as a non-vanishing current at zero phase difference. Our results reveal how dissipation fundamentally reshapes superconducting transport in topological junctions, opening new directions for dissipation-engineered quantum devices.

Title: Constructing a variational ground state of matter fermions coupled to a vison pair in Kitaev's honeycomb model
Authors: T. Grace, A. Principi
Abstract: We develop a new method to construct simple and explicit variational approximations for the ground state of Kitaev's honeycomb model with a non-trivial Z2 flux configuration consisting of a pair of visons on neighbouring plaquettes. The method consists of retaining only the largest singular values of the generator of the transformation between the vison-pair and flux-free ground states. We compare physical quantities calculated using the approximate state to those obtained by extrapolating results of exact diagonalisation of finite lattices, finding them to be in very good agreement. We discuss ways to extend the method to more complicated flux configurations.

Title: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Vortex Crystals in Tetrahedral Antiferromagnets: Fractional Charges and Topological Magnons
Authors: Tomoki Hirosawa, Alexander Mook, Maria Azhar
Abstract: We report the formation of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex crystal in the tetrahedral antiferromagnetic order on a triangular lattice. The noncoplanar tetrahedral state consists of four sublattices with spins oriented along the faces of a tetrahedron in spin space. The long-range order characterized by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology arises due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and appears at zero temperature and without external fields. Each vortex carries a half-integer electric charge relative to the uniform background in itinerant magnets, enabling the emergence of anyonic excitations. Its magnetic excitations include magnetically active gyrotropic and breathing modes, which -- under an external magnetic field -- carry nontrivial Chern numbers that stabilize chiral magnon edge states.

Title: Geometric Delocalization in Two Dimensions
Authors: Laura Shou, Alireza Parhizkar, Victor Galitski
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of transient two-dimensional surfaces where a random-walking particle escapes to infinity in contrast to localization in standard flat 2D space. We first prove that any rotationally symmetric 2D membrane embedded in flat 3D space cannot be transient. Then we formulate a criterion for the transience of a general asymmetric 2D membrane. We use it to explicitly construct a class of transient 2D manifolds with a non-trivial metric and height function but ``zero average curvature,'' which we dub tablecloth manifolds. The absence of the logarithmic infrared divergence of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in turn implies the absence of weak localization, non-existence of bound states in shallow potentials, and breakdown of the Mermin-Wagner theorem and Kosterlitz-Thouless transition on the tablecloth manifolds, which may be realizable in both quantum simulators and corrugated two-dimensional materials.

Title: Neural Wave Functions for High-Pressure Atomic Hydrogen
Authors: David Linteau, Saverio Moroni, Giuseppe Carleo, Markus Holzmann
Abstract: We leverage the power of neural quantum states to describe the ground state wave function of solid and liquid atomic hydrogen, including both electronic and protonic degrees of freedom. For static protons, the resulting Born-Oppenheimer energies are consistently comparable to or lower than all previous projector Monte Carlo results for systems containing up to $128$ hydrogen atoms. The same level of accuracy is preserved upon inclusion of nuclear quantum effects, thus going beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. In addition, our description overcomes major limitations of current wave functions, notably by avoiding any explicit symmetry assumption on the expected quantum crystal, and sidestepping efficiency issues of imaginary time evolution with disparate mass scales. As a first application, we examine crystal formation in an extremely high-density region up to pressure-induced melting.

Title: Finite-temperature properties and the hidden ferroelectric $R3c$ phase of bulk CaTiO$_3$ from second principles
Authors: Huazhang Zhang, Michael Marcus Schmitt, Louis Bastogne, Xu He, Philippe Ghosez
Abstract: A second-principles effective interatomic potential is introduced for the prototypical perovskite CaTiO$_3$ (CTO), relying on a Taylor polynomial expansion of the Born-Oppenheimer energy surface around the cubic reference structure, in terms of atomic displacements and macroscopic strains. This model captures various phases of bulk CTO and successfully reproduces, in particular, the structure, energy, and dynamical properties of the nonpolar $Pbnm$ ground state as well as of the hidden ferroelectric $R3c$ phase. Finite-temperature simulations suggest that the still debated sequence of structural phase transitions over heating is $Pbnm \ (a^-a^-c^+) \rightarrow C2/m \ (a^-b^-c^0) \rightarrow I4/mcm \ (a^-c^0c^0) \rightarrow Pm\bar{3}m \ (a^0a^0a^0)$, a sequence during which the oxygen-octahedra rotations around the three pseudocubic axes vanish successively. Although never experimentally observed in bulk, the ferroelectric $R3c$ phase appears to be metastable and at an energy only slightly above the $Pbnm$ ground state at 0 K. The simulations confirm that, if induced in some way, the $R3c$ phase remains stable up to about 300 K and shows ferroelectric properties. Furthermore, we find that the minimum energy path connecting the $Pbnm$ and $R3c$ phases involves localized layer-by-layer flipping of octahedral rotations, a mechanism which is shown to be at play during the thermal destabilization process of the $R3c$ phase toward the $Pbnm$ ground state. The proximity of the $R3c$ phase with the $Pbnm$ ground state suggests that the former could be stabilized under electric field. However, due to the large energy barrier, the field required for the $Pbnm$-to-$R3c$ transition appears to be extremely large, consistent with the fact that bulk CTO was never reported to be ferroelectric nor antiferroelectric.

Title: Band topology and dynamic multiferroicity induced from dynamical Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in centrosymmetric lattices
Authors: Bowen Ma, Z. D. Wang
Abstract: We develop a theory of a dynamical Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (dDMI) in centrosymmetric crystals by generally considering the vibration of both cations and anions. It gives rise to an antisymmetric spin-lattice coupling, inducing magnon-phonon hybridized topological excitations. Moreover, we find that this dDMI naturally exhibits a magnetoelectric feature, leading to the presence of dynamic multiferroicity with finite toroidal moment distribution in the momentum space. By comparing toroidal moments with band skyrmion structure, we reveal the intrinsic connection between band topology and dynamic multiferroicity through the dDMI.

Title: Tricritical Kibble-Zurek scaling in Rydberg atom ladders
Authors: Hanteng Wang, Xingyu Li, Chengshu Li
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism has been extensively studied in various second-order phase transitions, yet the case of tricriticality-the point where second-order phase transition lines terminate-remains experimentally elusive. Here, we theoretically propose probing KZ scaling at tricritical points using Rydberg atom arrays arranged as two- and three-leg ladders, which realize the tricritical Ising and tricritical Potts universality classes. By slowly ramping the Rabi frequency and detuning, we extract two relevant tricritical exponents, $\nu$ and $\nu'$, both via conventional paths from the disordered to the ordered phase and via "tangential" paths confined entirely within the disordered phase. At faster speeds, ramping dynamics go beyond the standard KZ paradigm: data collapse analysis using the parent critical exponents (rather than the tricritical ones) reveals renormalization group flows toward the adjacent second-order critical line, and we identify it as a dynamical analog of Zamolodchikov's $c$-theorem. Our protocol is readily implementable on existing Rydberg quantum simulators. This provides a direct route to measuring distinct tricritical exponents which can reveal an emergent spacetime supersymmetry constraint $1/\nu - 1/\nu' = 1$. Moreover, this work deepens our theoretical understanding and opens new avenues for exploring beyond-KZ quantum dynamics with rich renormalization group structure.

Title: Holstein mechanism in single-site model with unitary evolution
Authors: Chen-Huan Wu
Abstract: We investigate the Holstein mechanism in a single-electron (one-site) system, where unitary evolution intrinsically involves both fermion and boson operators under nonadiabatic conditions. The resulting unitary dynamics and boson-frequency dependence reveal a quantum phase transition, evidenced by distinct short-time (power-law decay) and long-time (exponential decay) behaviors, which are manifested in the polaronic shift, bosonic energy, and dynamics of reduced density matrix. This observation is consistent with a non-Markovian to Markovian transition.

Title: Colloidal nanoparticles in liquid crystals: Bulk properties, biaxiality and untwisting in cholesterics
Authors: Prabakaran Rajamanickam, Fatimah Almutari, Apala Majumdar
Abstract: We study the effects of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) in liquid crystal samples in the dilute limit, in a Landau--de Gennes theoretical framework. The effects of the suspended NPs are captured by a homogenized energy, as outlined in~\cite{canevari2020design}. For spatially homogeneous samples, we explicitly compute the critical points and minimizers of the modified Landau--de Gennes energy and show that the presence of NP eliminates the first-order isotropic-nematic phase transition, stabilises elusive biaxial phases over some temperature ranges and that the symmetry of the NP boundary conditions or surface treatments dictates the bulk equilibrium phase at high temperatures. We also numerically demonstrate structural transitions from twisted helical director profiles to untwisted director profiles in cholesteric-filled channel geometries, driven by the collective effects of the NPs and increasing temperature. These transitions are reversible upon lowering the temperature in sufficiently large domains, where thermal hysteresis can also be observed. This behaviour opens interesting avenues for tuning the optical properties of confined, nano-doped cholesteric systems.

Title: Nonadiabatic Origin of Quantum-Metric Effects via Momentum-Space Metric Tensor
Authors: Yafei Ren
Abstract: We reveal a fundamental geometric structure of momentum space arising from the nonadiabatic evolution of Bloch electrons. By extending semiclassical wave packet theory to incorporate nonadiabatic effects, we introduce a momentum-space metric tensor -- the nonadiabatic metric. This metric gives rise to two velocity corrections, dubbed geometric and geodesic velocities, providing a unified and intuitive framework for understanding nonlinear and nonadiabatic transport phenomena beyond Berry phase effects. Furthermore, we show that the nonadiabatic metric endows momentum space with a curved geometry, recasting wave packet dynamics as forced geodesic motion. In this picture, the metric defines distances, the Berry connection acts as a gauge potential, band dispersion serves as a scalar potential, and the toroidal topology of the Brillouin zone imposes periodic boundary conditions. When the nonadiabatic metric is constant, it reduces to an effective mass, allowing electrons to behave as massive particles in flat bands. In a flat Chern band with harmonic attractive interactions, the two-body wave functions mirror the Landau-level wave functions on a torus.

Title: Anomaly, Class Division, and Decoupling in Income Dynamics
Authors: Jaeseok Hur, Meesoon Ha, Hawoong Jeong
Abstract: Economic inequality emerges from the interplay between regional growth-rate differences and the interaction network that couples regions. We propose a minimal income-dynamics model, where heterogeneity is governed by growth-rate assortativity $\mathcal{A}$ and regional concentration $\mathcal{R}$, allowing us to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of empirically observed log-income distributions. To systematically analyze these patterns, we derive closed-form approximations for the Hellinger distance and the Gini index in limiting configurations. Our findings highlight the spatial segregation of growth rates as a key driver of economic class division and demonstrate how small-world shortcuts in the underlying network can disrupt this segregation. Finally, our framework provides a robust explanation for the bimodality and strong regional correlations found in global income distributions.

Title: Translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems: the noninteracting case
Authors: Molly Gibbins, Adam Gammon-Smith, Bruno Bertini
Abstract: The study of symmetry restoration has recently emerged as a fruitful means to extract high-level information on the relaxation of quantum many-body systems. However, while the restoration of internal symmetries has been investigated intensively, that of spatial symmetries has hitherto only been considered in the context of random unitary circuits. Here we present a complementary study of translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems. In particular, we consider a one-dimensional chain of spinless, non-interacting fermions quenched from a $\nu>1$ shift invariant state, and follow the local restoration of one-site shift invariance using the Frobenius distance $\Delta F_A$ between the state on a subsystem and its symmetrised counterpart. Distinct from the case of random unitary circuits, where symmetry restoration occurs abruptly for times proportional to the subsystem size, we find that symmetry here is restored smoothly and over timescales of the order of the subsystem size squared. We also find that the so-called `quantum Mpemba effect' is readily observed. Most importantly, we show that - in contrast to the case of continuous internal symmetries - this discrete symmetry restoration is not qualitatively described by a quasiparticle picture for $\Delta F_A$, and therefore goes beyond the hydrodynamic description. Our results can be directly extended to higher dimensions.

Title: Quantum state transfer and maximal entanglement between distant qubits using a minimal quasicrystal pump
Authors: Arnob Kumar Ghosh, Rubén Seoane Souto, Vahid Azimi-Mousolou, Annica M. Black-Schaffer, Patric Holmvall
Abstract: Coherent quantum state transfer over macroscopic distances between non-neighboring elements in quantum circuits is a crucial component to increase connectivity and simplify quantum information processing. To facilitate such transfers, an efficient and easily controllable quantum pump would be highly beneficial. In this work, we demonstrate such a quantum pump based on a one-dimensional quasicrystal Fibonacci chain~(FC). In particular, we utilize the unique properties of quasicrystals to pump the edge-localized winding states between the two distant ends of the chain by only minimal manipulation of the FC at its end points. We establish the necessary conditions for successful state transfer within a fully time-dependent picture and also demonstrate robustness of the transfer protocol against disorder. We then couple external qubits to each end of the FC and establish highly adaptable functionality as a quantum bus with both on-demand switching of the qubit states and generation of maximally entangled Bell states between the qubits. Thanks to the minimal control parameters, the setup is well-suited for implementation across diverse experimental platforms, thus establishing quasicrystals as an efficient platform for versatile quantum information processing.

Title: Proximity effect and p-wave superconductivity in s-wave superconductor/helimagnet heterostructures
Authors: G. A. Bobkov, A. V. Kornev, A. M. Bobkov, I. V. Bobkova
Abstract: It is known that in contrast to homogeneous ferromagnetism helical magnetism is compatible with superconductivity and causes only weak suppressive effect on superconducting critical temperature. Despite this fact it induces p-wave triplet superconducting correlations in homogeneous superconducting systems with intrinsic helical magnetism. The combination of these two facts indicates a high potential for the application of such systems in disspationless spintronics. For this reason here we investigate the proximity effect in atomically thin superconductor/helical (conical) magnet heterostructures (SC/HM). It is shown that in SC/HM heterostructures the strength of the proximity effect and, in particular, amplitude of p-wave triplet superconductivity and the degree of superconductivity suppression are complex functions of the magnet exchange field and filling factors of the magnet and the superconductor. Further we demonstrate that $p$-wave correlations ensure transport spin supercurrent flow in the SC/HM heterostructure with conical magnets and unveil the physical relationship between the transport spin supercurrent, degree of the magnet conicity and internal structure of p-wave correlations in the momentum space.

Title: Quantized order parameters of approximate symmetry for metals and insulators
Authors: Yasuhiro Tada
Abstract: We develop a simple scheme to distinguish between metals and insulators, or more generally gapless and gapped phases, by introducing the notion of an approximate symmetry order parameter. For one dimensional systems, we provide an explicit proof for the known criteria of metals and insulators based on the polarization operator which have been widely accepted for decades without a rigorous proof. For higher dimensions, we introduce a tiny magnetic flux to control the system, where the translation symmetry becomes approximate. We show that insulators and metals can be well distinguished with use of the approximate symmetry operators and they work as quantized order parameters in the thermodynamic limit characterizing gapless and gapped nature of the system.

Title: Nonconserved critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model as a surface kinetic roughening process
Authors: Héctor Vaquero del Pino, Rodolfo Cuerno
Abstract: We have revisited the non-conserved (or model A) critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model through numerical simulations of its lattice and continuum formulations --Glauber dynamics and the timedependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation, respectively--, to analyze them with current tools from surface kinetic roughening. Our study examines two critical quenches, one from an ordered and a different one from a disordered initial state, for both of which we assess the dynamic scaling ansatz, the critical exponent values, and the fluctuation field statistics that occur. Notably, the dynamic scaling ansatz followed by the system strongly depends on the initial condition: a critical quench from the ordered phase follows Family-Vicsek (FV) scaling, while a critical quench from the disordered phase shows an initial overgrowth regime with intrinsic anomalous roughening, followed by relaxation to equilibrium. This behavior is explained in terms of the dynamical instability of the stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation at the critical temperature, whereby the linearly unstable term is eventually stabilized by nonlinear interactions. For both quenches we have determined the occurrence of probability distribution functions for the field fluctuations, which are time-independent along the non-equilibrium dynamics when suitably normalized by the time-dependent fluctuation amplitude. Additionally, we have developed a related interface model for a field which scales as the space integral of the TDGL field (integral GL model). Numerical simulations of this model reveal either FV or faceted anomalous roughening, depending on the critical quenched performed, as well as an emergent symmetry in the fluctuation statistics for a critical quench from the ordered phase.

Title: Projective Representations, Bogomolov Multiplier, and Their Applications in Physics
Authors: Ryohei Kobayashi, Haruki Watanabe
Abstract: We present a pedagogical review of projective representations of finite groups and their physical applications in quantum many-body systems. Some of our physical results are new. We begin with a self-contained introduction to projective representations, highlighting the role of group cohomology, representation theory, and classification of irreducible projective representations. We then focus on a special subset of cohomology classes, known as the Bogomolov multiplier, which consists of cocycles that are symmetric on commuting pairs but remain nontrivial in group cohomology. Such cocycles have important physical implications: they characterize (1+1)D SPT phases that cannot be detected by string order parameters and give rise, upon gauging, to distinct gapped phases with completely broken non-invertible $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We construct explicit lattice models for these phases and demonstrate how they are distinguished by the fusion rules of local order parameters. We show that a pair of completely broken $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ SSB phases host nontrivial interface modes at their domain walls. As an example, we construct a lattice model where the ground state degeneracy on a ring increases from 32 without interfaces to 56 with interfaces.

Title: Molecular Dynamics Study of Rayleigh-Plateau Instability at Liquid-Liquid Interfaces
Authors: Shunta Kikuchi, Hiroshi Watanabe
Abstract: We investigated the Rayleigh-Plateau instability at the interface between two immiscible liquids of equal viscosity using molecular dynamics simulations. Two types of initial conditions were considered, one with an imposed single-mode perturbation at the interface and the other without any imposed perturbation. Under the single-mode perturbation, the growth rate deviated from the theoretical prediction for small cylinder radii, but progressively approached and agreed with classical macroscopic theory as the radius increased. In contrast, for the unperturbed initial condition, we found a systematic relationship between the breakup time and the minimum radius, in which the power-law exponent increased with increasing radius. These results demonstrate that, even in extremely microscopic systems with cylinder radii on the order of only about fifteen atomic diameters, the growth of the instability can follow macroscopic theoretical predictions when appropriate conditions are imposed, and that the influence of thermal fluctuations on the breakup dynamics becomes increasingly significant as the system radius decreases.

Title: Unified theory of magnetization temperature dependence in ferrimagnets
Authors: Rostyslav O. Serha, Anna Pomyalov, Andrii V. Chumak, Victor S. L'vov
Abstract: Recent advancements in spintronics and fundamental physical research have brought increased attention to the rare-earth-based magnetically ordered materials. One of the important properties of these materials is the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization $M(T)$. Recently, a successful framework was proposed for the theoretical description of M(T) across the entire temperature range from zero to the Curie temperature in simple cubic ferromagnets, EuO and EuS. We extend this approach to compute and analyze $M(T)$ for multi-sublattice collinear ferrimagnets such as Yttrium Iron Garnet $Y_3Fe_5 O_{12}$. We analyzed and generalized for multi-sublattice collinear ferrimagnets two well-known approximations describing $M(T)$. The first approach is the Bloch-3/2 law, which describes the suppression of $M(T)$ due to spin-wave excitation, and is valid in the low-temperature limit $T << T_c$. The second one is Weiss's mean-field approximation, which provides a reasonable description of $M(T)$ near $T_c$. Using a single tuning parameter, we combine these two approaches to describe $M(T)$ for any $0<T<T_c$. The theoretical result for $M(T)$ aligns well with our measurements and the previously available experimental data across the entire temperature range. We also demonstrate that experimental and theoretical dependences $M(T)$ follow the mean-field prediction $\sqrt{T_c - T }$ for almost all temperatures.

Title: Random displacements in critical Rydberg atom arrays
Authors: Xingyu Li, Shuyan Zhou, Xue Chen, Chengshu Li, Hanteng Wang
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays promise high-fidelity quantum simulations of critical phenomena with flexible geometries. Yet experimental realizations inevitably suffer from disorder due to random displacements of atoms, leading to departures from the expected behavior. Here, we study how such positional disorder influences the Ising criticality. Since disorder breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, one might expect the system to flow to an infinite-strength disordered fixed point, erasing all nontrivial critical features in low spatial dimensions. Remarkably, we find instead that disorder in Rydberg systems is subjected to nontrivial local constraints, making the physics markedly different from systems with more conventional spatially short-range correlated or long-range correlated disorder. This leads to new classes of criticalities even at dimensions where conventional disorder would destroy criticality altogether. We then demonstrate as a consequence how a novel pseudo-criticality emerges in Rydberg atom chains of experimentally realistic scale, and show that the renormalization group flow is governed by a locally constrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking perturbation. Our findings uncover new disorder-driven phenomena and underscore the importance of carefully treating disorder effects in quantum simulators.

Title: Quantum many-body scarring from Kramers-Wannier duality
Authors: Weslei B. Fontana, Fabrizio G. Oliviero, Yi-Ping Huang
Abstract: Kramers-Wannier duality, a hallmark of the Ising model, has recently gained renewed interest through its reinterpretation as a non-invertible symmetry with a state-level action. Using sequential quantum circuits (SQC), we argue that this duality governs the stability of quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states in a nonintegrable model, depending on whether the dual preserves the embedding conditions for scarring. This is supported by good agreement between first-order perturbation theory and numerics, which capture scar dynamics despite chaotic spectra. Our results establish non-invertible dualities as both a generative mechanism and a diagnostic tool for quantum many- body scarring, offering a generalized symmetry-based route to weak ergodicity breaking.

Title: Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for feedback cooling
Authors: Kousuke Kumasaki, Kaito Tojo, Takahiro Sagawa, Ken Funo
Abstract: Feedback cooling enables a system to achieve low temperatures through measurement-based control. Determining the thermodynamic cost required to achieve the ideal cooling efficiency within a finite time remains an important problem. In this work, we establish a thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) for feedback cooling in classical underdamped Langevin systems, thereby deriving a trade-off between the cooling efficiency and the entropy reduction rate. The obtained TUR implies that simultaneous achievement of the ideal cooling efficiency and finite entropy reduction rate is asymptotically possible by letting the fluctuation of the reversible local mean velocity diverge. This is shown to be feasible by using a feedback control based on the Kalman filter. Our results clarify the thermodynamic costs of achieving the fundamental cooling limit of feedback control from the perspective of the TUR.

Title: Spin and thermal current scaling at a $Y$-junction of XX spin chains
Authors: Domenico Giuliano, Francesco Buccheri
Abstract: We study the boundary phase diagram and the low-temperature heat and magnetization transport at a $Y$-junction of XX spin chains. Depending on the magnetization axis anisotropy between the magnetic exchange interactions at the junction, the system exhibits two different strong-coupling regimes at low energies/temperatures, similar to the overscreened (topological) four- and to the two-channel Kondo fixed points. Using renormalization group arguments combined with boundary conformal field theory methods, we show the instability of the former under any XY-type anisotropy at the junction. We analyze the low-temperature spin and the heat conductances. We find evidence of spin fractionalization of the elementary excitations at the four-channel Kondo fixed point by means of the magnetic Wiedemann-Franz law. We caution that the instability under XY anisotropy may hinder the detection of the phenomenology related to the four-channel Kondo effect, therefore requiring careful control in experimental realizations.

Title: Correlating on-the-fly Electrical and Optical Skyrmion Readout
Authors: Grischa Beneke, Kilian Leutner, Nikhil Vijayan, Fabian Kammerbauer, Duc Minh Tran, Sachin Krishnia, Johannes Güttinger, Armin Satz, Robert Frömter, Mathias Kläui
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, topologically stabilized spin textures, are promising candidates for future memory devices and non-conventional computing applications due to their enhanced stability, non-linear interactions, and low-power manipulation capabilities. Despite their significant potential, the reliable electrical readout of individual skyrmions remains a fundamental challenge. While magnetic tunnel junctions and anomalous Hall effect (AHE)-based techniques have demonstrated skyrmion detection capabilities, they currently fail to reliably detect single moving skyrmions as required for applications. Our approach leverages thermally activated skyrmions, where a low constant drive current simultaneously generates both skyrmion motion and the Hall voltage necessary for detection. We demonstrate the reliability of this method through real-time correlation between measured Hall voltage signals and direct Kerr microscopy imaging. Two consecutive Hall crosses allow for determining the skyrmion velocity, in accordance to Kerr microscopy videos. We present an analytical formula for the skyrmion AHE readout signal, demonstrating scalability from micrometer to nanometer skyrmions. These advances establish a robust platform for skyrmion-based sensors, counters and unconventional computing systems that depend on precise individual skyrmion control and detection.

Title: Machine Learning Time Propagators for Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Simulations
Authors: Karan Shah, Attila Cangi
Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a machine learning approach to accelerate electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials by utilizing fast machine learning predictions in a large space of varying experimental parameters of the laser.

Title: Quantum Transport in Ultrahigh-Conductivity Carbon Nanotube Fibers

Abstract: We investigate quantum transport in aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers fabricated via solution spinning, focusing on the roles of structural dimensionality and quantum interference effects. The fibers exhibit metallic behavior at high temperatures, with conductivity increasing monotonically as the temperature decreases from room temperature to approximately 36 K. Below this temperature, the conductivity gradually decreases with further cooling, signaling the onset of quantum conductance corrections associated with localization effects. Magnetoconductance measurements in both parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields exhibit pronounced positive corrections at low temperatures, consistent with weak localization (WL). To determine the effective dimensionality of electron transport, we analyzed the data using WL models in 1D, 2D, and 3D geometries. We found that while the 2D model can reproduce the field dependence, it lacks physical meaning in the context of our fiber architecture and requires an unphysical scaling factor to match the experimental magnitude. By contrast, we developed a hybrid 3D+1D WL framework that quantitatively captures both the field and temperature dependences using realistic coherence lengths and a temperature-dependent crossover parameter. Although this combined model also employs a scaling factor for magnitude correction, it yields a satisfactory fit, reflecting the hierarchical structure of CNT fibers in which transport occurs through quasi-1D bundles embedded in a 3D network. Our results establish a physically grounded model of phase-coherent transport in macroscopic CNT assemblies, providing insights into enhancing conductivity for flexible, lightweight power transmission applications.

Title: Applying a Gaussian networking theory to model motor-driven transport along cytoskeletal filaments
Authors: Nadine du Toit (1), Kristian K. Müller-Nedebock (1,2) ((1) Department of Physics, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, South Africa, (2) National Institute for Theoretical and Computational Sciences, Stellenbosch, South Africa)
Abstract: This paper builds on a recently introduced dynamical networking framework, applying it to model motor-driven transport along cytoskeletal filament networks. Within this approach, the networking functional describes the periodic binding and unbinding of motors to available filament sites,whilst accounting for all possible pairing, enabling a field-theoretic treatment of constrained motion in complex networks. In this application, the dynamical networking theory is introduced into a Martin-Siggia-Rose representation of the Langevin dynamics describing the motion of a motor protein and its cargo. Results are presented in a collective description of motors on a network, for two different scenarios, namely homogeneous and non-homogeneous networks. A diffusion coefficient is presented for homogeneous networks, whilst it is shown that various possibilities remain for disordered averaging over network densities for non-homogeneous networks.

Title: Radio-frequency charge detection on graphene electron-hole double quantum dots
Authors: Katrin Hecker, Samuel Möller, Hubert Dulisch, Şiyar Duman, Leon Stecher, Lucca Valerius, Tobias Deußen, Saketh Ravuri, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Florian Libisch, Christian Volk, Christoph Stampfer
Abstract: High-fidelity detection of charge transitions in quantum dots (QDs) is a key ingredient in solid state quantum computation. We demonstrate high-bandwidth radio-frequency charge detection in bilayer graphene quantum dots (QDs) using a capacitively coupled quantum point contact (QPC). The device design suppresses screening effects and enables sensitive QPC-based charge readout. The QPC is arranged to maximize the readout contrast between two neighboring, coupled electron and hole QDs. We apply the readout scheme to a single-particle electron-hole double QD and demonstrate time-resolved detection of charge states as well as magnetic field dependent tunneling rates. This promises a high-fidelity readout scheme for individual spin and valley states, which is important for the operation of spin, valley or spin-valley qubits in bilayer graphene.

Title: Topological Phase Diagram of Generalized SSH Models with Interactions
Authors: Yuxiao Hang, Stephan Haas
Abstract: We investigate interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains with two- and three-site unit cells using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations. By selecting appropriate filling fractions and sweeping across interaction strength \( J_z \) and dimerization \( \delta \), we map out their phase diagrams and identify transition lines via entanglement entropy and magnetization measurements. In the two-site model, we observe the emergence of an interaction-induced antiferromagnetic intermediate phase between the topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes, as well as a critical region at negative \( J_z \) with suppressed magnetization and finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy. In contrast, the three-site model lacks an intermediate phase and exhibits asymmetric edge localization and antiferromagnetic ordering in both positive and negative \( J_z \) regimes. We further examine the response of edge states to Ising perturbations. In the two-site model, zero-energy edge modes are topologically protected and remain robust up to a finite interaction strength. However, in the three-site model, where the edge states reside at finite energy, this protection breaks down. Despite this, the edge-localized nature of these states survives in the form of polarized modes whose spatial profiles reflect the non-interacting limit.

Title: From Quantum Tsallis Entropy to Strange Metals
Authors: Xian-Hui Ge
Abstract: We develop a unified framework connecting quantum Tsallis statistics to electronic transport in strongly interacting systems. Starting from Rényi and Tsallis entropies, we construct a quantum Tsallis distribution that reduces to the conventional Fermi--Dirac distribution when $q=1$. For $q$ slightly deviating from unity, the correction term in the occupation function can be mapped to a $q$-deformed Schwarzian action, corresponding to soft reparametrization modes. Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi Golden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity at high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze magnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle consistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low temperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover Fermi-liquid quadratic behaviors. This approach provides a controlled interpolation between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid regimes, quantitatively linking $q$-deformation, soft-mode dynamics, and experimentally measurable transport coefficients in strange metals.

Title: Mapping Microstructure: Manifold Construction for Accelerated Materials Exploration
Authors: Simon A. Mason, Megna N. Shah, Jeffrey P. Simmons, Dennis M. Dimiduk, Stephen R. Niezgoda
Abstract: Accelerating materials development requires quantitative linkages between processing, microstructure, and properties. In this work, we introduce a framework for mapping microstructure onto a low-dimensional material manifold that is parametrized by processing conditions. A key innovation is treating microstructure as a stochastic process, defined as a distribution of microstructural instances rather than a single image, enabling the extraction of material state descriptors that capture the essential process-dependent features. We leverage the manifold hypothesis to assert that microstructural outcomes lie on a low-dimensional latent space controlled by only a few parameters. Using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition as a model material system, we compare multiple microstructure descriptors (two-point statistics, chord-length distributions, and persistent homology) in terms of two criteria: (1) intrinsic dimensionality of the latent space, and (2) invertibility of the processing-to-structure mapping. The results demonstrate that distribution-based descriptors can recover a two-dimensional latent structure aligned with the true processing parameters, yielding an invertible and physically interpretable mapping between processing and microstructure. In contrast, descriptors that do not account for microstructure variability either overestimate dimensionality or lose predictive fidelity. The constructed material manifold is shown to be locally continuous, wherein small changes in process variables correspond to smooth changes in microstructure descriptors. This data-driven manifold mapping approach provides a quantitative foundation for microstructure-informed process design and paves the way toward closed-loop optimization of processing--structure--property relationships in an integrated materials engineering context.

Title: Power-Law Spectra and Asymptotic $ω/T$ Scaling in the Orbital-Selective Mott Phase of a Three-Orbital Hubbard Model
Authors: Fabian Eickhoff
Abstract: Quantum materials whose properties lie beyond the celebrated Landau Fermi-liquid paradigm have been observed for decades across diverse material platforms. Finding microscopic lattice models for metallic states that exhibit such peculiar behavior remains a major theoretical challenge, as these features often originate from strong quantum fluctuations in strongly interacting electron systems. Here we investigate a three-orbital Hubbard model at a high-symmetry point that hosts a transition from a metallic to an orbital-selective Mott (OSM) phase. Employing single-site dynamical mean-field theory combined with full-density-matrix numerical renormalization group, we chart the $T-U$ phase diagram and obtain high-resolution real-frequency dynamics. In the OSM regime we find asymptotically scale-invariant (power-law) single-particle spectra and asymptotic $\omega/T$ scaling in both charge and spin channels, spanning several decades in frequency and temperature.

Title: Ginzburg-Landau theory of spin pumping through an antiferromagnetic layer near the Néel temperature
Authors: Yuto Furutani, Hayato Fukushima, Yutaka Yamamoto, Masanori Ichioka, Hiroto Adachi
Abstract: Spin pumping is a microwave-driven means for injecting spins from a ferromagnet into the adjacent target material. The insertion of a thin antiferromagnetic layer between the ferromagnet and the target material is known to enhance the spin pumping signal. Here, in view of describing dynamic fluctuations of the Néel order parameter, we develop Ginzburg-Landau theory of the spin pumping in a ferromagnet/antiferromagnet/heavy metal trilayer in the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic Néel temperature $T_{\rm N}$. When there exists an interfacial exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic spins and the antiferromagnetic Néel order parameter at the ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface, we find a strongly frequency-dependent enhancement of the pumped spin current that is peaked at $T_{\rm N}$. The present finding offers an explanation for the enhanced spin pumping with strong frequency dependence observed in a Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/CoO/Pt system.

Title: Collisional relaxation in shielded dipolar molecular gases
Authors: Reuben R. W. Wang, John L. Bohn
Abstract: We discuss the influence of collisions on the dynamics of an ultracold gas whose constituents interact via dipolar forces. This dynamics is governed by the elastic scattering cross section of the molecules, which is to some extent under the experimentalist's control. We compare side-by-side several different situations, highlighting their similarities and differences. These situations are collisions between: 1) point dipoles; 2) electric-field-shielded polar molecules; and 3) microwave-shielded polar molecules, including the effect of microwave ellipticity.

Title: Suppression of quantized heat flow by the dielectric response of a compressible strip at the quantum Hall edge
Authors: Eugene V. Sukhorukov, Adrien Tomà
Abstract: We develop a unified perturbative framework for energy transport along a chiral quantum Hall edge coupled to a disordered, compressible strip. Treating the strip as a generic linear response environment characterized by its retarded susceptibility, we obtain leading corrections to both the heat flux carried by the edge plasmon and to its spectrum. Two generic regimes emerge: (i) a gapped, local dielectric response with finite-range coupling, producing a negative correction to the quantized heat flux that scales as T^4 at low temperatures together with a convex cubic shift of the plasmon dispersion; and (ii) a hydrodynamic (diffusive) response with relaxation, yielding a crossover from T^4 to T^{3/2} scaling and a change of sign in the correction. We further introduce a microscopic dipolar model in which the edge couples electrostatically to localized dipole moments inside a wide compressible strip. This long-range interaction amplifies the nonlocal dielectric back-action and generates new suppression laws, T^3 or even T^2 for smooth disorder profiles, together with a universal ratio connecting spectral curvature to thermal response. Across all regimes, the total heat flux remains quantized: the apparent deficit of the plasmon contribution reflects reversible heat drag into the compressible strip rather than a breakdown of quantization. The framework thus provides a coherent and quantitatively plausible explanation of the "missing heat flux" anomaly and unifies the thermal and spectral signatures of quantum Hall edge dynamics.

Title: Superconductivity in overdoped cuprates can be understood from a BCS perspective!
Authors: B.J. Ramshaw, Steven A. Kivelson
Abstract: We summarize key experimental studies of the low energy properties of overdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors and conclude that a theoretical understanding of the ``essential physics'' is achievable in terms of a conventional Fermi-liquid treatment of the normal state, and a BCS mean-field treatment of the ($d$-wave) superconducting state. For this perspective to be consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable predictions concerning the expected behavior of an ``ideal'' (disorder free) overdoped cuprate.

Title: Exploring Replica Symmetry Breaking and Topological Collapse in Spin Glasses with Quantum Annealing
Authors: Kumar Ghosh
Abstract: Replica symmetry breaking (RSB) underlies the complex organization of disordered systems, yet quantitative validation beyond $N \sim 100$ spins has remained computationally challenging. We use quantum annealing to access ground states of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model up to $N = 4000$ spins, enabling the most extensive test of Parisi's Nobel Prize-winning RSB solution to date. Five independent observables confirm RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value with characteristic $N^{-2/3}$ corrections, energy fluctuations scale as $N^{-3/4}$ ($\gamma = 0.739 \pm 0.036$), the chaos exponent $\theta = 0.51 \pm 0.02$ ($R^2 = 0.989$) confirms mean-field universality, the overlap distribution exhibits hierarchical structure ($\sigma_q = 0.19$), and the complexity remains invariant under 36\% network dilution. Beyond a critical threshold $0.8 < D_c < 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously through a cooperative avalanche that converts the entire system to vacancies within a narrow parameter window $\Delta D = 0.1$. These findings establish quantum computation as a tool for probing emergent many-body phenomena and uncover the topological foundations of complexity in disordered systems, with implications for neural networks, optimization, and materials science.

Title: Phase transitions in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice
Authors: Jie Qiao, Shu-Hao Zhang, Jing-Bo Qin
Abstract: The nature of the intermediate ground-state phase in the spin-1/2 frustrated square lattice model has long been debated. Using cluster density matrix embedding theory, we investigate the phase diagram of this model. The Neel phase is directly identified for J2<0.45 and the collinear phase for J2>0.65 based on the ground state. Although no direct evidence of an internal phase transition is found within the intermediate phase from the ground state, analysis of the first excited state wave function reveals a continuous quantum phase transition in this region, with a critical point at J2=0.55. This critical point divides the intermediate phase into PVBS and CVBS.

Title: Sliding of cylindrical shell into a rigid hole
Authors: Yukiho Matsumoto, Keisuke Yoshida, Tomohiko G. Sano
Abstract: Fitting two different materials is a versatile methodology in manufacturing complex structures. One of the canonical models for fitting is the snap-fit model, in which flexible materials and rigid structures are assembled by pushing their interlocking components together. The assembly via snap-fit is often accompanied by large deformations of flexible structures and abrupt force drops, highlighting the role of elasticity, geometry, and contact friction. Despite several model studies revealing fundamental mechanics for snap-fit, the current snap-fit design relies on prototyping and empirical rules. In this paper, we analyze a snap-fit model in which a naturally curved beam slips into a rigid hole. We construct an analytical model based on the theory of elastica with contact friction and demonstrate that its predictions are in excellent quantitative agreement with both simulations and experiments. We find three distinct sliding modes: Folding, Pinning, and Unfolding. The classification is systematically organized in a phase diagram based on the geometric parameters of the shells and the hole. Our study complements existing approaches by providing a predictive framework for contact-based structures that involve friction, elasticity, and geometry, and sheds light on a unified understanding of the interactions between an elastic and a rigid body.

Title: Thermalization of exact quantum many-body scars in spin-1 XY chain under perturbation
Authors: Himadri Halder
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are special eigenstates that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis while residing at finite energy density along with thermalizing eigenstates. The spin-1 XY model is known to host a family of such exceptional states originating from long-lived quasiparticle excitations that exhibit anomalously low entanglement entropy and long-time periodic revivals, resulting in weak ergodicity breaking. We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbation in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicate that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $\lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength.

Title: Limitations on Activation of High Dose Ge implant in beta-Ga2O3
Authors: Tianhai Luo, Katie R. Gann, Cameron A. Gorsak, Ming-Chiang Chang, Prescott E Evans, Thaddeus J Asel, Hari P Nair, R. B. van Dover, Michael O. Thompson
Abstract: Among ultrawide bandgap semiconductors, beta-Ga2O3 is particularly promising for high power and frequency applications. For devices, n-type concentrations above 10^19 cm^-3 are required. Ge is a promising alternative n-type dopant with an ionic radius similar to Ga. Homoepitaxial 010 beta-Ga2O3 films were implanted with Ge to form 50 and 100 nm box concentration of 3*10^19 cm^-3 and 5*10^19 cm^-3, with damage ranging from 1.2 to 2.0 displacement per atom. For lower damage implants, optimized anneals in ultrahigh purity N2 at 950-1000 C for 5-10 minutes resulted in Rs of 600-700 omega/sqr, mobilities of 60-70 cm^2/Vs, and Ge activation of up to 40%. For higher damage implants, activation dropped to 23% with similar mobilities. Ge diffusion, measured by second ion mass spectrometry, showed formation of a Ge "clustering peak" with a concentration exceeding the initial implant following anneals in N2 or O2 at 950-1000 C. Beyond this peak, minimal Ge diffusion occurred for N2 anneals at 950 C, but at 1050 C non-Fickian diffusion extended to >200 nm. Electrical activation data suggests that clustered Ge is electrically inactive. To understand Ge clustering, several samples were characterized by synchrotron x-ray diffraction. Second-phase precipitates were observed in as-implanted samples which then fully dissoved after furnace annealing in N2 at 1050 C. Diffraction peaks suggest these implant-induced precipitates may be related to a high pressure Pa-3 phase of GeO2, and may evolve during anneals to explain the Ge clustering. Ultimately, we believe Ge clustering limits activation of implanted Ge at high concentrations.

Title: Vacancy Engineering in Metals and Alloys
Authors: Sreenivas Raguraman, Homero Reyes Pulido, Christopher Hutchinson, Arun Devaraj, Marc H. Weber, Michael L. Falk, Timothy P. Weihs
Abstract: Vacancy engineering, the intentional control of atomic-scale vacancies in metals and alloys, is emerging as a powerful yet underexplored strategy for tailoring microstructures and optimizing performance across diverse applications. By enabling excess vacancy populations through quenching, severe deformation, thermomechanical treatments, or additive manufacturing, new microstructures can be obtained that achieve unique combinations of strength, ductility, fatigue life, corrosion resistance, and conductivity. Vacancies are distinct among lattice defects: they are non-conserved entities essential for solute diffusion, yet variably coupled to solutes, dislocations, and phase boundaries. They can accelerate transformations such as nucleation and precipitation or retard kinetics when trapped in clusters, and their transient trapping and release can drive microstructural evolution across time and length scales. This Review synthesizes recent advances in generating, modeling, and characterizing vacancies, highlighting their role in diffusion, precipitation, and phase stability. Case studies in lightweight, high-temperature, fatigue-resistant, electrical, and biomedical materials demonstrate the broad potential of vacancy control. We conclude by emphasizing the opportunity for the metallurgical community to fully exploit excess vacancies as controllable, design-relevant defects that enable new pathways for microstructure and property optimization in next-generation alloys.

Title: Dichroism from Chiral Thermoelectric Probes: Generalized Sum Rules for Orbital and Heat Magnetizations
Authors: Baptiste Bermond, Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Anaïs Defossez, Nathan Goldman
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that relates orbital and heat magnetizations to experimentally accessible excitation spectra, through thermoelectric probes and generalized sum rules. By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions. Excitation rates under chiral thermoelectric drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties.

Title: Observing the spatial and temporal evolution of exciton wave functions

Abstract: Excitons, the correlated electron-hole pairs governing optical and transport properties in organic semiconductors, have long resisted direct experimental access to their full quantum-mechanical wave functions. Here, we use femtosecond time-resolved photoemission orbital tomography (trPOT), combining high-harmonic probe pulses with time- and momentum-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, to directly image the momentum-space distribution and ultrafast dynamics of excitons in $\alpha$-sexithiophene thin films. We introduce a quantitative model that enables reconstruction of the exciton wave function in real space, including both its spatial extent and its internal phase structure. The reconstructed wave function reveals coherent delocalization across approximately three molecular units and exhibits a characteristic phase modulation, consistent with ab initio calculations within the framework of many-body perturbation theory. Time-resolved measurements further show a $\sim 20$\% contraction of the exciton radius within 400 fs, providing direct evidence of self-trapping driven by exciton-phonon coupling. These results establish trPOT as a general and experimentally accessible approach for resolving exciton wave functions -- with spatial, phase, and temporal sensitivity -- in a broad class of molecular and low-dimensional materials.

Title: Multi-Mode Lens for Momentum Microscopy and XPEEM: Theory
Authors: Olena Tkach, Gerd Schoenhense
Abstract: The strong electric field between the sample and the extractor is the core of cathode lenses and a pivotal determinant of high resolution. Nevertheless, fields in the range of 3-8 kV/mm can be a source of complications. Local field enhancement at sharp edges or microscopic protrusions of cleaved samples may result in field emission or flashovers. Moreover, slow background electrons are drawn into the microscope column, where they contribute to space charge effects. A novel front lens configuration, optimized through ray-tracing simulations, significantly reduces the field at the sample and allows even for zero field or retarding field, which serves to suppress space charge effects. One or several annular electrodes, situated in a concentric position relative to the extractor, serve to form an additional lens within the gap between the sample and the extractor. The refractory power of this lens, and consequently the field at the sample surface, can be modified by adjusting the potentials of the annular electrodes. The imaging properties and aberrations of this gap lens have been investigated with regard to momentum imaging and XPEEM. The study encompasses the energy range from the few-eV level for laser-ARPES to 6 keV, for hard X-ray ARPES. The additional converging lens situated in close proximity to the sample exhibits a reduced field curvature of the k-image in the backfocal plane. This allows for the acquisition of larger fields of view in both momentum and real-space imaging.

Title: Probing Lambda-Gravity with Bose-Einstein Condensate
Authors: Hector A. Fernandez-Melendez, Alexander Belyaev, Vahe Gurzadyan, Ivette Fuentes
Abstract: We propose a precise test of two fundamental gravitational constants using a detector concept that exploits the dynamics of quantum phononic excitations in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), operable at the scale of tabletop experiments. In this setup, the sensitivity is enhanced by approximately 2 orders of magnitude through the use of a tritter operation, which mixes phononic excitations with the BEC's ground state. The BEC exhibits unique sensitivity to the two key components of the gravitational potential in $\Lambda$-gravity: the Newtonian $GM/r$ term and the cosmological constant $\Lambda r^2$, both entering the most general function following from a Gurzadyan's theorem. Using state-of-the-art experimental design, we predict that the gravitational constant $G$ could be measured with an accuracy up to $10^{-17}$ N m$^2$/kg$^2$, representing an improvement by 2 orders of magnitude over current measurements. Moreover, this experiment aims to establish the best Earth-based upper limit on $\Lambda$ at $<10^{-31}$ m$^{-2}$, marking the first laboratory-based probe of the cosmological constant. Additionally, the setup allows for the measurement of the distance-dependent behavior of each term in the gravitational potential, providing a means to test modified gravity theories.

Title: Stabilizing Non-Abelian Topological Order against Heralded Noise via Local Lindbladian Dynamics
Authors: Sanket Chirame, Abhinav Prem, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Fiona J. Burnell
Abstract: An important open question for the current generation of highly controllable quantum devices is understanding which phases can be realized as stable steady-states under local quantum dynamics. In this work, we show how robust steady-state phases with both Abelian and non-Abelian mixed-state topological order can be stabilized, in two spatial dimensions (2d), against generic ``heralded" noise using active dynamics that incorporate measurement and feedback, modeled as a \emph{fully local} Lindblad master equation. These topologically ordered steady states are two-way connected to pure topologically ordered ground states using local quantum channels, and preserve quantum information for a time that is exponentially large in the system size. Specifically, we present explicit constructions of families of local Lindbladians for both Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_2$) and non-Abelian ($D_4$) topological order whose steady-states host mixed-state topological order when the noise is below a threshold strength. As the noise strength is increased, these models exhibit first-order transitions to intermediate mixed state phases where they encode robust classical memories, followed by (first-order) transitions to a trivial steady state at high noise rates. When the noise is imperfectly heralded, steady-state order disappears but our active dynamics significantly enhances the lifetime of the encoded logical information. To carry out the numerical simulations for the non-Abelian $D_4$ case, we introduce a generalized stabilizer tableau formalism that permits efficient simulation of the non-Abelian Lindbladian dynamics.

Title: Statistics of Abelian topological excitations
Authors: Hanyu Xue
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel theory that generalizes the concept of anyon statistics to Abelian topological excitations of any dimension. We axiomatize excitations as a selected collection of states and operators satisfying the configuration axiom and the locality axiom, purely based on many-body quantum mechanics. Upon these axioms, we define a rigorous and self-contained theory of statistics using only basic algebra and can be implemented on a computer. While our theory is developed independently, the results align with existing physical theories.

Title: Overcoming Quantum Metrology Singularity through Sequential Measurements
Authors: Yaoling Yang, Victor Montenegro, Abolfazl Bayat
Abstract: The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.

Title: Origin of slow earthquake statistics in low-friction soft granular shear
Authors: Yuto Sasaki, Hiroaki Katsuragi
Abstract: Slow earthquakes differ from regular earthquakes in their slower moment release and size distribution dominated by smaller events. However, the physical origin of these slow earthquake statistics remains controversial. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that their characteristics emerge from low-friction soft granular shear. To model slow-earthquake fault materials under hydrothermal conditions, we use a low-friction soft hydrogel particle layer floating on lubricating fluid and conduct stick-slip experiments. The observed slip events follow the same laws of both moment release rate and size distribution as with slow earthquakes, contrasting with frictional rigid granular shear. Slip size is determined by the competing effects of shear localization and pressure enhancement with decreasing porosity. These findings indicate that low friction and particle softness in sheared granular systems with sparse contact structures cause slow earthquake statistics, which may be driven by pore fluid dynamics and shear localization within hazardous fault zones.

Title: Nonstabilizerness in open XXZ spin chains: Universal scaling and dynamics
Authors: Doru Sticlet, Balázs Dóra, Dominik Szombathy, Gergely Zaránd, Cătălin Paşcu Moca
Abstract: Magic, or nonstabilizerness, is a crucial quantum resource, yet its dynamics in open quantum systems remain largely unexplored. We investigate magic in the open XXZ spin chain under either boundary gain and loss, or bulk dephasing using the stabilizer Rényi entropy $M_2$. To enable scalable simulations of large systems, we develop a novel, highly efficient algorithm for computing $M_2$ within the matrix product states formalism while maintaining constant bond dimension--an advancement over existing methods. For boundary driving, we uncover universal scaling laws, $M_2(t) \sim t^{1/z}$, linked to the dynamical exponent $z$ for several distinct universality classes. We also disentangle classical and quantum contributions to magic by introducing a mean-field approximation for magic, thus emphasizing the prominent role of quantum critical fluctuations in nonstabilizerness. For bulk dephasing, dissipation can transiently enhance magic before suppressing it, and drive it to a nontrivial steady-state value. These findings position magic as a powerful diagnostic tool for probing universality and dynamics in open quantum systems.

Title: Macroscopicity and observational deficit in states, operations, and correlations
Authors: Teruaki Nagasawa, Eyuri Wakakuwa, Kohtaro Kato, Francesco Buscemi
Abstract: To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of microscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability. This work is dedicated to Professor Ryszard Horodecki on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in deep admiration and gratitude for his pioneering contributions to quantum information theory.

Title: Exact treatment of the memory kernel under time-dependent system-environment coupling via a train of delta distributions
Authors: Yuta Uenaga, Kensuke Gallock-Yoshimura, Takano Taira
Abstract: Memory effects in a quantum system coupled to an environment are one of the central features in the theory of open quantum systems. The dynamics of such quantum systems are typically governed by an equation of motion with a time-convolution integral of the memory kernel. However, solving such integro-differential equations is challenging, especially when the memory kernel is nonstationary (not time-translation invariant). In this paper, we analytically and nonperturbatively solve such integro-differential equations with a nonstationary memory kernel by employing a train of Dirac-delta switchings. We then apply this method to the damped Jaynes-Cummings model and the damped harmonic oscillator model to demonstrate that (i) our solution asymptotes to the well-known exact solution in the continuum limit, and that (ii) our method also enables us to visualize the memory effect in the environment.

Title: Quantum sequel of neural network training
Authors: Hao Zhang, Alex Kamenev
Abstract: Training of neural networks (NNs) has emerged as a major consumer of both computational and energy resources. Quantum computers were coined as a root to facilitate training, but no experimental evidence has been presented so far. Here we demonstrate that quantum annealing platforms, such as D-Wave, can enable fast and efficient training of classical NNs, which are then deployable on conventional hardware. From a physics perspective, NN training can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition: the system evolves from an initial spin glass state to a highly ordered, trained state. This process involves eliminating numerous undesired minima in its energy landscape. The advantage of annealing devices is their ability to rapidly find multiple deep states. We found that this quantum training achieves superior performance scaling compared to classical backpropagation methods, with a clearly higher scaling exponent (1.01 vs. 0.78). It may be further increased up to a factor of 2 with a fully coherent quantum platform using a variant of the Grover algorithm. Furthermore, we argue that even a modestly sized annealer can be beneficial to train a deep NN by being applied sequentially to a few layers at a time.

Title: Efficient implementation of quantum signal processing via the adiabatic-impulse model
Authors: D.O. Shendryk, O.V. Ivakhnenko, S.N. Shevchenko, Franco Nori
Abstract: Here we investigate analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.

Title: Irrational CFTs from coupled anyon chains with non-invertible symmetries?
Authors: António Antunes, Junchen Rong
Abstract: Irrational CFTs in 1+1d with a discrete spectrum and no conserved currents other than the stress-tensor are expected to be generic, unsolvable by standard methods, and hard to construct explicitly. We introduce a lattice model that realizes a candidate for such a CFT as a conformal phase of matter without fine-tuning. The model is constructed by coupling $N\geq3$ golden anyon chains together, preserving $N$ copies of the Fibonacci non-invertible symmetry. We use the MPS/DMRG approach to study this model numerically, which allows us to calculate the corresponding conformal data, obtaining hints of its irrationality. Along the way, we characterize the phase diagram for $N=2$ coupled chains where we identify a weakly first-order phase transition as well as critical points that we are able to identify with known rational CFTs, except for one case. We also provide an extensive list of rational CFTs with $1<c<2.1$.

Title: Wave propagation in an elastic lattice with non-reciprocal stiffness and engineered damping
Authors: Harshit Kumar Sandhu, Saurav Dutta, Rajesh Chaunsali
Abstract: Nonreciprocal wave propagation allows for directional energy transport. In this work, we systematically investigate wave dynamics in an elastic lattice that combines nonreciprocal stiffness with viscous damping. After establishing how conventional damping counteracts the system's gain, we introduce a non-dissipative form of nonreciprocal damping in the form of gyroscopic damping. We find that the coexistence of nonreciprocal stiffness and nonreciprocal damping results in a decoupled control mechanism. The nonreciprocal stiffness is shown to govern the temporal amplification rate, while the nonreciprocal damper independently tunes the wave's group velocity and oscillation frequency. This decoupling gives rise to phenomena such as the enhancement of net amplification for slower-propagating waves, and also boundary-induced wave interference arising from divergent and convergent reflected wave trajectories with varying growth rates. These findings provide a theoretical framework for designing active metamaterials with more versatile control over their wave propagation characteristics.

Title: Extending fusion rules with finite subgroups: For a general understanding of quotient or gauging
Authors: Yoshiki Fukusumi, Shinichiro Yahagi
Abstract: We construct the $Z_{N}$ symmetry extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\subset Z_{N})$. The chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the $Z_{N}$ graded symmetry topological field theories and also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures.

Title: Self-similar kinetics for gravitational Bose-Einstein condensation
Authors: A.S. Dmitriev, D.G. Levkov, A.G. Panin, I.I. Tkachev
Abstract: We study an overpopulated gas of gravitationally interacting bosons surrounding a droplet of Bose-Einstein condensate - Bose star. We argue that kinetic evolution of this gas approaches with time a self-similar attractor solution to the kinetic equation. If the scale symmetry of the equation is broken by external conditions, the attractor solution exists, remains approximately self-similar, but has slowly drifting scaling dimension. The latter new regime of adiabatic self-similarity can determine growth of dark matter Bose stars in cosmological models.

Title: Heralded Emission Detection in InAs/ZnSe Quantum Dot Solids Using Time-Correlated Photons
Authors: Chieh Tsao, Xiang Li, Alex Hinkle, Yifan Chen, Elvar Oskarsson, Uri Banin, Hendrik Utzat
Abstract: Harnessing quantum correlations between photons is an emerging frontier in optical spectroscopy, yet experimental demonstrations have largely remained limited to molecular systems at room temperature. Here, we investigate heralded emission detection (HED) under continuous-wave entangled-photon excitation of near-infrared (NIR)-emitting colloidal III-V quantum dot (QD) solids at low temperatures. We demonstrate the advantages of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) for high time resolution ($\sim$72 ps) and large-area NIR avalanche photodiodes (APDs) for high emission count rates ($\sim$2000 cps). Second-order photon-correlation analysis reveals exciton lifetimes and fine-structure energy splittings. These results establish NIR colloidal QDs as a bright, tunable model system for quantum-light spectroscopy and highlight their compatibility with optical cavities as a further experimental control parameter.

Title: Diffusion Models are Kelly Gamblers
Authors: Akhil Premkumar
Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for maximizing returns in betting games. A signal that is correlated with the outcome of such a game can be used to focus the bets on a narrow range of high probability predictions. Diffusion models share the same paradigm in that they gradually concentrate the probability mass to fit the training data. We show that the information stored in an unconditional diffusion model captures, in part, the joint correlation between the components of the data variable $X$. Conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. The latter is only a small fraction of the total information in the neural network if the data is low-dimensional. We examine why this does not hinder conditional generation.

Title: Frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy for nanometric layer thickness imaging with GHz elastic plate resonances
Authors: Martin Ryzy, Guqi Yan, István Veres, Thomas Berer, Ivan Alić, Clemens Grünsteidl, Georg Watzl, Georg Gramse, Susanne Kreuzer
Abstract: Nanometric layer thickness imaging is crucial for fundamental research and characterization of micro fabricated devices. Here, we assess the potential of a non-contact opto-acoustic frequency domain laser ultrasound (FreDomLUS) microscopy technique for imaging nanometric thickness variations via GHz zero-group velocity (ZGV) elastic plate resonances. The method exploits the ZGV's lateral energy confinement that leads to sharp resonance peaks which can be effectively probed with the FreDomLUS technique at GHz acoustic frequencies. For demonstration purposes we introduced sub-10 nm height variation patterns in the topmost layer of solidly mounted bulk-acoustic wave resonators with a design frequency of around 1.7 GHz. They are raster-scanned to retrieve ZGV-frequencies from local acoustic spectra as a contrast quantity for imaging. We show how to retrieve quantitative height information by numerically calibrating the factor which inversely relates ZGV frequency change with the layer thickness change. Height variations in stacks with nominal thickness changes of 8 nm, 4 nm, and 1 nm can be resolved and indicate sub-nanometer depth resolution capabilities. The lateral resolution is studied by measuring the method's step edge function and it is found to be in the micrometer range. Atomic force microscopy imaging is used to validate the results.

Title: Topological Orders from Reflection Positive Frustration-free Hamiltonians
Authors: Zhengwei Liu, Zishuo Zhao
Abstract: We establish a framework with reflection positivity as the first principle for establishing the boundary theory of topologically ordered quantum spin systems. For any reflection positive frustration-free Hamiltonian, We proved that the local topological quantum order (LTQO) condition of ground states on a disk holds if and only if the ground state on the sphere is non-degenerate. Furthermore, we show that the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction produces the boundary local net of operator algebras from the local ground states.

Title: Information phases of partial projected ensembles generated from random quantum states and scrambling dynamics
Authors: Alan Sherry, Saptarshi Mandal, Sthitadhi Roy
Abstract: The projected ensemble -- an ensemble of pure states on a subsystem conditioned on projective measurement outcomes on its complement -- provides a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure than the reduced density matrix of the subsystem in bipartite quantum states. This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. We contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures. Finally, we show that these information phases, as characterised by the Holevo information, emerge in the dynamics of chaotic quantum circuits and discuss the associated timescales.

Title: Benchmarking machine learning models for multi-class state recognition in double quantum dot data
Authors: Valeria Díaz Moreno, Ryan P Khalili, Daniel Schug, Patrick J. Walsh, Justyna P. Zwolak
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a leading platform for scalable quantum processors. However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs.
