Title: Nano-size fragmentation of Tantalum in Copper composite using additive manufacturing
Authors: Rakesh Das, Pawan Kumar Dubey, Raphael Benjamim de Oliveira, Douglas S. Galvao, Indranil Manna, Sameehan S. Joshi, Peter Samora Owuor, Leonardo D. Machado, Nirmal Kumar Katiyar, Suman Chakraborty, Chandra Sekhar Tiwary
Abstract: The biggest challenge in manufacturing an immiscible system is phase segregation and non-uniformity inside the composite matrix. Additive manufacturing has the potential to overcome these difficulties due to the high cooling rate achieved during the process. Here we have developed immiscible Copper-based composites reinforced with Tantalum, which were fabricated using the powder bed fusion melting (PBF-M) technique. The distinct advantage of utilizing Tantalum in this process resides in its high melting point, allowing it to remain in particle form within the composite and contribute to its mechanical and surface/wear properties. The PBF-M results in the in situ fragmentation of micron-size Tantalum particles into nanoparticle form through a surface roughening process during laser interaction, enhancing its mechanical and wear properties. The microstructural evolution of Cu-Ta composites is explained through multiscale numerical modeling. The enhanced yield strength and the dynamics of the Ta particles were corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations. The maximum yield strength is exhibited by Cu-5wt%Ta of 80 MPa. Addition of Ta also have significant improvement in wear properties of composites. The current results can be exploited to develop complex shape, high energy efficient copper-based composites.

Title: Vibrationally Assisted Exciton Transfer in Open Quantum Systems with Long-Range Interactions
Authors: Diego Fallas Padilla, Visal So, Abhishek Menon, Roman Zhuravel, Han Pu, Guido Pagano
Abstract: The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel-exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the transfer reduction by static disorder and by finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.

Title: On the extension of the concept of rheological connections to a finite deformation framework using multiple natural configurations
Authors: Tarun Singh, Sandipan Paul
Abstract: The constitutive behaviors of materials are often modeled using a network of different rheological elements. These rheological models are mostly developed within a one-dimensional small strain framework. One of the key impediments of extending these models to a three-dimensional finite deformation setting is to determine how the different types of connections, i.e., a series and a parallel connection, are incorporated into the material models. The primary objective of this article is to develop an appropriate strategy to address this issue. We show that both the series and the parallel connection between two rheological elements can be modeled within a multiple natural configurations framework without changing or introducing new configurations. The difference in a series and a parallel connection is manifested in the ratio of the stress powers expended during the deformations of the associated rheological elements. Finite deformation version of some well-known rheological models have been used to demonstrate the utility of the proposed theory.

Title: Stability of dipolar bosons in a quasiperiodic potential
Authors: Paolo Molignini, Barnali Chakrabarti
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials and dipolar interactions each impose long-range order in quantum systems, but their interplay unlocks a rich landscape of unexplored quantum phases. In this work, we investigate how dipolar bosonic crystals respond to correlated disorder in the form of quasiperiodic potentials. Using exact numerical simulations and a suite of observables - including order parameters, energy, density distributions, and two-body coherence measures - we explore one-dimensional dipolar bosons in quasiperiodic lattices at both commensurate and incommensurate fillings. Our results reveal a complex competition between superfluid, Mott insulator, density-wave, and crystalline phases, governed by the intricate balance of dipolar interactions, kinetic energy, and disorder strength. Crucially, we identify mechanisms that influence dipolar crystals, showing their surprising robustness even in the presence of strong quasiperiodic disorder. Strikingly, we challenge previous claims by demonstrating that a kinetic crystal phase - expected to precede full crystallization - does not emerge in the ground state. Instead, its traits appear only under moderate disorder, but never fully develop, giving way to a direct transition from a charge density wave to a crystal state. These findings provide new insights into the resilience of many-body quantum phases in complex environments and pave the way for engineering exotic quantum states in ultracold atomic systems.

Title: Quantum noise spectroscopy of superconducting critical dynamics and vortex fluctuations in a high-temperature cuprate
Authors: Zhongyuan Liu, Ruotian Gong, Jaewon Kim, Oriana K. Diessel, Qiaozhi Xu, Zack Rehfuss, Xinyi Du, Guanghui He, Abhishek Singh, Yun Suk Eo, Erik A. Henriksen, G. D. Gu, Norman Y. Yao, Francisco Machado, Sheng Ran, Shubhayu Chatterjee, Chong Zu
Abstract: Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. However, extracting universal dynamical features requires resolving correlations at both low energy and momentum. Here, we introduce nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a novel and powerful quantum sensing platform of superconducting materials. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach by probing several low-energy phenomena in high-$T_c$ cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO) -- gapless quasiparticle excitations, critical fluctuations at the metal-superconductor transition and kinetics of vortices. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, we find a sharp reduction in the NV relaxation time ($T_1$) near the critical temperature $T_c\approx90~$K, attributed to supercurrent-fluctuation induced magnetic noise. Crucially, the temperature-scaling of the noise near criticality deviates from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field prediction and reflects critical order parameter fluctuations, allowing us to determine both static and dynamical critical exponents for the transition. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of $T_1$ near $T_c$, indicating significant field-induced smearing of the transition. By analyzing the scaling of the BSCCO-induced relaxation rate with the field strength, we unveil evidence in favor of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, deep inside the superconducting phase, we employ NV decoherence ($T_2$) spectroscopy to observe strong magnetic fluctuations in the low-frequency regime, suggesting the presence of complex vortex-solid fluctuations. Our results establish NV-based noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.

Title: Chiral Instabilities in Driven-Dissipative Quantum Liquids
Authors: Zhi-Xing Lin, Bastien Lapierre, Per Moosavi, Shinsei Ryu
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of periodically driven Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) coupled to a thermal bath using a Floquet-Lindblad approach. When the coupling to the bath satisfies detailed balance, we obtain a condition for parametric instabilities to be suppressed, symmetrically for both chiralities. Remarkably, by designing a purely chiral coupling to the bath, instead of instability suppression, we uncover a driven-dissipative phase transition between the former symmetric parametric instability and a new chiral parametric instability. In the latter, a single chirality of bosonic quasiparticles gets exponentially amplified, leading to a dynamical chiral imbalance within the TLL, reminiscent of the non-Hermitian skin effect.

Title: A comparison of phase field models of brittle fracture incorporating strength: I -- Mixed-mode loading
Authors: Umar Khayaz, Aarosh Dahal, Aditya Kumar
Abstract: The classical variational phase-field model for brittle fracture effectively predicts the growth of large pre-existing cracks. However, the modeling of crack nucleation continues to be a significant challenge. Crack nucleation under uniform stress depends on the material's strength surface whose description is fundamentally incompatible with the energy-based Griffith propagation criterion. To address this, three main phase-field approaches have emerged, each attempting to reconcile material strength and toughness. The first, known as the classical variational approach, preserves the variational structure but fails to accurately incorporate the strength surface. In contrast, the other two approaches -- the complete nucleation and hybrid cohesive zone models -- sacrifice variational consistency. Among these, only the complete nucleation approach precisely accounts for the strength surface. All three approaches, especially the second one, deviate from the sharp variational theory of brittle fracture, raising concerns about their reliability in predicting the growth of cracks under non-mode-I loading. This paper evaluates precisely this issue. It is the first in a series of studies comparing the three approaches, systematically investigating crack growth under mode II, mode III, and mixed-mode loadings. The results confirm that the complete nucleation approach effectively predicts crack growth across all investigated problems, and its predictions agree well with those from other two approaches for tension-dominated cases. Additionally, the findings highlight that inaccurate accounting of the strength surface in the classical variational approach can influence crack path predictions. Lastly, they reveal that modifying the crack driving force to incorporate the strength surface in the hybrid cohesive zone approach causes crack propagation at an incorrect fracture toughness.

Title: Enhanced chemical vapour deposition of monolayer MoS2 films via a clean promoter
Authors: Lulin Wang, Yue Sun, Kaushik Kannan, Lee Gannon, Xuyun Guo, Aran Rafferty, Karl Gaff, Navaj B. Mullani, Haizhong Weng, Yangbo Zhou, Valeria Nicolosi, Cormac Mc Guinness, Hongzhou Zhang
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), exemplified by molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have shown exceptional potential for data-centred, energy-efficient electronic applications due to their unique electrical, optoelectronic, and mechanical properties. However, challenges such as the controllable synthesis of high-quality, large-area 2D MoS2 films and the mitigation of contamination during growth remain significant barriers to their integration into advanced technologies. Here, we developed a novel contamination-free growth promoter, enabling the clean and scalable synthesis of high quality 2D MoS2 with desirable grain structures via chemical vapour deposition (CVD). By optimising the reactant concentration and S/Mo ratio, we achieved promoter-dominated enhanced growth with enhanced quality, as evidenced by the increased MoS2 flake size and coverage, alongside a strong PL A exciton peak at 1.84 eV, matching that of the mechanically exfoliated sample. This approach facilitates the clean and site-specific growth of high-quality 2D MoS2, establishing a robust pathway for the practical implementation of 2D MoS2 in next-generation electronic devices.

Title: Evidence of Athermal Metastable Phase in a Halide Perovskite: Optically Tracked Thermal-Breach Memory
Authors: Kingshuk Mukhuti, Satyaki Kundu, Debasmita Pariari, Deepesh Kalauni, Ashutosh Mohanty, Aniket Bajaj, D. D. Sarma, Bhavtosh Bansal
Abstract: Halide perovskite materials have been extensively studied in the last decade because of their impressive optoelectronic properties. However, their one characteristic that is uncommon for semiconductors is that many undergo thermally induced structural phase transitions. The transition is hysteretic, with the hysteresis window marking the boundary of the metastable phase. We have discovered that in methylammonium lead iodide, this hysteretic metastable phase is athermal, meaning it shows almost no temporal phase evolution under isothermal conditions. We also show that a large number of distinguishable metastable states can be prepared following different thermal pathways. Furthermore, under a reversible thermal perturbation, the states in the metastable phase either show return-point memory or undergo a systematic nonrecoverable phase evolution, depending on the thermal history and the sign of the temperature perturbation. Since the phase fraction can be probed with extreme sensitivity via luminescence, we have an optically retrievable memory that reliably records any breach in temperature stability. Such thermal-breach memory in athermal martensites, of which there are numerous examples, may be useful for tagging packages requiring strict temperature control during transportation or preservation.

Title: Strongly dispersive dielectric properties of high-ScN-fraction ScAlN deposited by molecular beam epitaxy
Authors: Vikrant J. Gokhale, James G. Champlain, Matthew T. Hardy, James L. Hart, Andrew C. Lang, Saikat Mukhopadhyay, Jason A. Roussos, Shawn C. Mack, Gabriel Giribaldi, Luca Colombo, Matteo Rinaldi, Brian P. Downey
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of dielectric properties including complex permittivity, loss, and leakage of high-ScN-fraction ScAlN thin films grown using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Dielectric spectroscopy is carried out on high-ScN-fraction (30%-40% ScN fraction) samples from 20 Hz to 10 GHz. We find that real permittivity {\epsilon}' increases significantly with increasing ScN fraction; a trend confirmed by density functional theory. Further, {\epsilon}' is strongly dispersive with frequency and increasing ScN fraction, with values for Sc0.4Al0.6N varying from 150 down to 60 with increasing frequency. Loss, dispersion, and DC leakage current correspondingly increase with ScN fraction. The high {\epsilon}' and strongly dispersive behavior in MBE ScAlN are not observed in a sputter-deposited ScAlN control with a similar ScN fraction, highlighting fundamental differences between films produced by the two deposition methods. Microscopy and spectroscopy analyses are carried out on MBE- and sputter-deposited samples to compare microstructure, alloy, and dopant concentration.

Title: Direct Visualization of Temperature-Induced Phase Separation of Completely Miscible Au-Pd Alloy by In-Situ TEM
Authors: Abhijit Roy, Simon Hettler, Raul Arenal
Abstract: In-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies reveal key insights into the structural and chemical evolution of nanoparticles (NPs) under external stimuli like heating and biasing, which is critical for evaluating their suitability in chemical reactions and their tendency towards forming novel NP systems. In this study, starting from a core@shell Au nanotriangle (AuNT)@Pd nanostructure, the formation of a phase-separated bi-metallic Au-Pd NP system at high temperature is reported, despite the fact that Au and Pd are miscible in the entire composition and temperature range. In-situ TEM heating of bare AuNT@Pd core@shell structures up to 1000°C has been performed. Between 400°C and 800°C, an initial alloy formation has been observed. It is also noted that higher initial loading of Pd increases the melting temperature of the bi-metallic system. However, the most important observation is the separation of the nanostructure into Au and Pd phases at temperatures higher than 850° C for high Pd doping. The extent of Pd separation depends on the amount of initial Pd loading. A Janus Au-Pd nanostructure is formed at the end of the thermal treatments at 1000° C. The phase-separated NP is observed to be highly stable and could be clearly beneficial for various applications, particularly in catalytic processes.

Title: Generalized $\eta$-pairing theory and anomalous localization in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Kai Lieta
Abstract: By generalizing the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices, we obtain the sufficient and necessary condition for the eta-pairing operator to be an eigenoperator of the Hamiltonian $H$, and find unique eta-pairing phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be respected even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators and the anomalous localization of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. We then generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstate can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Thus, eta-pairing may represent a new mechanism for skin effects in interacting non-Hermitian systems, even in higher dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry. To realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena, we construct a general two-sublattice model defined on an arbitrary lattice, which can exhibit anomalous localization of eta-pairing eigenstates; besides, this model can reveal the eta-pairing structure [e.g., the $SO(4)$ symmetry] in systems with Hermitian hoppings.

Title: Giant coercivity and enhanced intrinsic anomalous Hall effect at vanishing magnetization in a compensated kagome ferrimagnet
Authors: Jonathan M. DeStefano, Elliott Rosenberg, Guodong Ren, Yongbin Lee, Zhenhua Ning, Olivia Peek, Kamal Harrison, Saiful I. Khondaker, Liqin Ke, Igor I. Mazin, Juan Carlos Idrobo, Jiun-Haw Chu
Abstract: Ferrimagnets that can be driven to magnetic compensation show promise for use in spintronics as they exhibit a finite anomalous Hall effect at zero magnetic field without having a significant magnetic moment. Compensated ferrimagnet spintronic devices with both a large anomalous Hall effect and a high coercivity would be simultaneously easy to read and difficult to erase. The kagome ferrimagnet TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$ has been reported to host a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Here, we demonstrate that doping the Mn sites with Cr drives the system towards magnetic compensation. For nearly compensated compositions at low temperatures, giant coercive fields exceeding 14 T are observed. Additionally, Cr doping significantly enhances the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, which can be attributed to a shift in the Fermi level. Our results extend the range of unique magnetic states observed in kagome materials, demonstrating that chemical doping is an effective strategy to tune and realize these states.

Title: Visualizing Field-free Deterministic Magnetic Switching of all-van der Waals Spin-Orbit Torque System Using Spin Ensembles in Hexagonal Boron Nitride

Abstract: Recently, optically active spin defects embedded in van der Waals (vdW) crystals have emerged as a transformative quantum sensing platform to explore cutting-edge materials science and quantum physics. Taking advantage of excellent solid-state integrability, this new class of spin defects can be arranged in controllable nanoscale proximity of target materials in vdW heterostructures, showing great promise for improving spatial resolution and field sensitivity of current sensing technologies. Building on this state-of-the-art measurement platform, here we report hexagonal boron nitride-based quantum imaging of field-free deterministic magnetic switching of room-temperature two-dimensional magnet Fe3GaTe2 in an all-vdW spin-orbit torque (SOT) system. By visualizing SOT-driven variations of nanoscale Fe3GaTe2 magnetic stray field profile under different conditions, we have revealed how the observed magnetic switching evolves from deterministic to indeterministic behavior due to the interplay between out-of-plane spins, in-plane spins and Joule heating. This understanding, which is otherwise difficult to access by conventional transport measurements, offers valuable insights on material design, testing, and evaluation of next-generation vdW spintronic devices.

Title: Fundamental Factors Governing Stabilization of Janus 2D-Bulk Heterostructures with Machine Learning
Authors: Tara M. Boland (Technical University of Denmark), Rachel Gorelik (Arizona State University), Arunima K. Singh (Arizona State University)
Abstract: The more-than-6000 2D materials predicted thus far provide a huge combinatorial space for forming functional heterostructures with bulk materials, with potential applications in nanoelectronics, sensing, and energy conversion. In this work, we investigate nearly 1000 heterostructures, the largest number of heterostructures thus far, of 2D Janus and bulk materials' surfaces using ab initio simulations and machine learning (ML) to deduce the structure-property relationships of the complex interfaces in such heterostructures. We first perform van der Waals-corrected density functional theory simulations using a high-throughput computational framework on 51 Janus 2D materials and 19 metallic, cubic phase, elemental bulk materials that exhibit low lattice mismatches and low coincident site lattices. The formation energy of the resultant 1147 Janus 2D-bulk heterostructures were analyzed and 828 were found to be thermodynamically stable. ML models were trained on the computed data, and we found that they could predict the binding energy and $z$-separation of 2D-bulk heterostructures with root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 0.05 eV/atom and 0.14 angstroms, respectively. The feature importance of the models reveals that the properties of the bulk materials dominate the heterostructures' energies and interfacial structures heavily. These findings are in-line with experimentally observed behavior of several well-known 2D materials-bulk systems. The data used within this paper is freely available in the Ab Initio 2D-Bulk Heterostructure Database (aiHD). The fundamental insights on 2D-bulk heterostructures and the predictive ML models developed in this work could accelerate the application of thousands of 2D-bulk heterostructures, thus stimulating research within a wide range of electronic, quantum computing, sensing, and energy applications.

Title: Laser-driven Ultrafast Dynamics of a Fractional Quantum Hall System
Authors: Ammar Kirmani, Benedikt Fauseweh, Jian-Xin Zhu
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems are strongly interacting electron systems with topological order. These systems are characterized by novel ground states, fractionally charged and neutral excitations. The neutral excitations are dominated by a low-energy collective magnetoroton mode. Here we derive and use a quasi-one-dimensional model to investigate the ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-driven FQH system within a two-Landau-level approximation. As opposed to the traditional and synthetic bilayers, our model accounts for interactions where electrons can scatter from one Landau-level to another. By performing exact time evolution of the system, we create an out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse that shows rich physics. Our calculations show the presence of non-trivial excited modes. One of these modes is electromagnetically active and represent density oscillations of \emph{magnetoplasmon} mode. Another mode is identified by evaluating the overlap of the initial state and the out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse with a quadrupole operator. This mode is analogous to the chiral-graviton mode for FQH systems recently measured in experiments [Nature {\bf 628}, 78 (2024)]. Our results show that a linearly-polarized pulse field can excite the graviton mode when inter-Landau level scattering occurs.

Title: Pure momentum-shift bulk photovoltaic effect in ferroelectric flat-band Mott insulators
Authors: Zhuocheng Lu, Zhihao Gong, Jingshan Qi, Hua Wang, Kai Chang
Abstract: The shift current photovoltaic effect is conventionally understood as the real-space displacement of a wave packet induced by photoexcitation. However, this interpretation becomes insufficient in flat-band systems, where quasiparticles are too massive to accelerate in real space under the optical electric field. Here, we developed a gauge-invariant method to decompose the shift current into real-space and momentum-space components. A surprising pure momentum-space shift current is found theoretically in flat-band Mott insulator Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br, I) monolayers. This work underscores that significant shift current responses can emerge even in systems with minimal interband polarization differences, highlighting the potential for exploring novel bulk photovoltaic effects in flat-band Mott insulators.

Title: Self-limiting states of polar misfits: Frustrated assembly of warped-jigsaw particles
Authors: Michael Wang, Gregory M. Grason
Abstract: We study the ground state thermodynamics of a model class of geometrically frustrated assemblies, known as {\it warped-jigsaw} particles. While it is known that frustration in soft matter assemblies has the ability to propagate up to mesoscopic, multi-particle size scales, notably through the selection of self-limiting domain, little is understood about how the symmetry of shape-misfit at the particle scale influences emergent morphologies at the mesoscale. Here we show that polarity in the shape-misfit of warped-jigsaw puzzles manifests at a larger scale in the morphology and thermodynamics of the ground-state assembly of self-limiting domains. We use a combination of continuum theory and discrete particle simulations to show that the polar misfit gives rise to two mesoscopically distinct polar, self-limiting ribbon domains. Thermodynamic selection between the two ribbon morphologies is controlled by a combination of the binding anisotropy along distinct neighbor directions and the orientation of polar shape-misfit. These predictions are valuable as design features for ongoing efforts to program self-limiting assemblies through the synthesis of intentionally frustrated particles, and further suggests a generic classification of frustrated assembly behavior in terms of the relative symmetries of shape-misfit and the underlying long-range inter-particle order it frustrates.

Title: Beyond the Bethe-Salpeter equation in DFT based computational spectroscopy
Authors: Alessandro Mirone, Mauro Rovezzi, Christoph Sahle, Alessandro Longo
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that accurately describes resonances beyond the reach of both multiplet-based and density-functional-theory (DFT)-based codes. When a resonance acquires strong continuum character, multiplet approaches struggle with the exponential growth of the Hilbert space driven by the increasing number of relevant orbitals, if they extend beyond a few atomic and ligand orbitals. Conversely, existing \emph{ab initio} codes, supplemented by diagrammatic techniques, remain largely confined to the Bethe--Salpeter equation, which tracks only two-particle excitations. However, many systems of interest, particularly those containing open $d$ or $f$ shells, require the propagation of an $N$-particle system, yielding a richer spectral landscape dominated by significant continuum effects. Here, we propose a theoretical framework, together with its numerical implementation, that bridges this gap and enables the rigorous exploration of such resonances.

Title: Coherent spin dynamics in ensembles of randomly oriented singly charged colloidal nanoplatelets and nanocrystals
Authors: Aleksandr A. Golovatenko, Anna V. Rodina
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the pump-probe Faraday rotation and ellipticity signals in ensembles of uniaxially anisotropic CdSe nanoplatelets and nanocrystals. We use the Faraday rotation mechanism based on the excitation of negative heavy hole trions for a magnetic field applied in the Voigt geometry. Three types of ensembles with typical spatial distributions of the orientation of the anisotropy axis with respect to the direction of light propagation are considered. Faraday rotation and ellipticity signals are modeled for excitation by single and repeated pump pulses, taking into account the anisotropy of the electron g-factor. We show that spin dephasing caused by the electron g-factor anisotropy and the arbitrary orientation of nanoplatelets or nanocrystals result only in partial damping of oscillation amplitude in contrast to the dephasing caused by the dispersion of the electron g-factor in the ensemble. We demonstrate that regardless of the g-factor anisotropy degree the oscillation frequency of the Faraday rotation and ellipticity signals for a randomly oriented ensemble is determined by the transverse electron g-factor component.

Title: Mixed-symmetry superconductivity and the energy gap
Authors: Pramodh Senarath Yapa, Xinyu Guo, Joseph Maciejko, Frank Marsiglio
Abstract: The symmetry of the superconducting order parameter, or simply the ``gap'', provides certain constraints on the actual mechanism that gives rise to pairing and ultimately to superconductivity. In this work we continue to investigate the possible symmetries that can arise, particularly below $T_c$, for a generic tight-binding model. We first examine the 1D case to better illustrate the prevalence of symmetry-breaking transitions below $T_c$, and then the more realistic 2D case. In both cases we illustrate the implication for spectroscopic investigations of the energy gap by calculating the density of states for different temperatures below $T_c$. The result is a very different signature near $T_c$ compared to that near $T=0$. A complete picture of the superconducting symmetry can only be attained if measurements are made over the entire temperature range.

Title: Enskog and Enskog-Vlasov equations with a slightly modified correlation factor and their H theorem
Authors: Shigeru Takata, Aoto Takahashi
Abstract: A novel modification of the original Enskog equation is proposed. The modification is much simpler than that is made in the modified (or revised) Enskog equation proposed by van Beijeren \& Ernst in 1973 and does not require a consideration of many-body configuration. The proposed modification is general enough to be adapted to various equations of states for non-ideal gases. It is shown that the H-theorem can be established for the Enskog and the Enskog--Vlasov equation with the proposed modification.

Title: Probing the flat-band limit of the superconducting proximity effect in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Josephson junctions
Authors: A. Diez-Carlon, J. Diez-Merida, P. Rout, D. Sedov, P. Virtanen, S. Banerjee, R. P. S. Penttila, P. Altpeter, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, S.-Y. Yang, K. T. Law, T. T. Heikkila, P. Torma, M. S. Scheurer, D. K. Efetov
Abstract: While extensively studied in normal metals, semimetals and semiconductors, the superconducting (SC) proximity effect remains elusive in the emerging field of flat-band systems. In this study we probe proximity-induced superconductivity in Josephson junctions (JJs) formed between superconducting NbTiN electrodes and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) weak links. Here the TBG acts as a highly tunable topological flat-band system, which due to its twist-angle dependent bandwidth, allows to probe the SC proximity effect at the crossover from the dispersive to the flat-band limit. Contrary to our original expectations, we find that the SC remains strong even in the flat-band limit, and gives rise to broad, dome shaped SC regions, in the filling dependent phase diagram. In addition, we find that unlike in conventional JJs, the critical current Ic strongly deviates from a scaling with the normal state conductance GN. We attribute these findings to the onset of strong electron interactions, which can give rise to an excess critical current, and also work out the potential importance of quantum geometric terms as well as multiband pairing mechanisms. Our results present the first detailed study of the SC proximity effect in the flat-band limit and shed new light on the mechanisms that drive the formation of SC domes in flat-band systems.

Title: Unified description of viscous, viscoelastic, or elastic thin active films on substrates
Authors: Henning Reinken, Andreas M. Menzel
Abstract: It is frequent for active or living entities to find themselves embedded in a surrounding medium. Resulting composite systems are usually classified as either active fluids or active solids. Yet, in reality, particularly in the biological context, a broad spectrum of viscoelasticity exists in between these two limits. There, both viscous and elastic properties are combined. To bridge the gap between active fluids and active solids, we here systematically derive a unified continuum-theoretical framework. It covers viscous, viscoelastic, and elastic active materials. Our continuum equations are obtained by coarse-graining a discrete, agent-based microscopic dynamic description. In our subsequent analysis, we mainly focus on thin active films on supporting substrates. Strength of activity and degree of elasticity are used as control parameters that control the overall behavior. We concentrate on the analysis of transitions between spatially uniform analytical solutions of collective migration. These include isotropic and polar, orientationally ordered states. A stationary polar solution of persistent directed collective motion is observed for rather fluid-like systems. It corresponds to the ubiquitous swarming state observed in various kinds of dry and wet active matter. With increasing elasticity, persistent motion in one direction is prevented by elastic anchoring and restoring forces. As a consequence, rotations of the spatially uniform migration direction and associated flow occur. Our unified description allows to continuously tune the material behavior from viscous, via viscoelastic, to elastic active behavior by variation of a single parameter. Therefore, it allows in the future to investigate the time evolution of complex systems and biomaterials such as biofilms within one framework.

Title: Interplay of Kondo Physics with Incommensurate Charge Density Waves in CeTe$_3$

Abstract: CeTe$_3$ is a 2-dimensional (2D) Van der Waals (VdW) material with incommensurate charge density waves (CDW), extremely high transition temperature ($T_{CDW}$) and a large momentum-dependent CDW gap that leaves a significant portion of the Fermi surface intact. It is also considered to be a weak Kondo system, a property unexpected for a material with incommensurate CDW, where each atomic site is slightly different. Here, we study the properties of the CDW state in several RTe$_3$ (R is rare earth) materials and examine the hybridization of itinerant states with the localized Ce $4f$ multiplet in CeTe$_3$ by using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We find that the renormalization of the itinerant states originating from the hybridization with the localized $4f$ states at $-260$ meV extends to the Fermi level. This, with remnants of another localized state at the Fermi level, supports the characterization of CeTe$_3$ as a weak Kondo material. Furthermore, we uncover a $k$-dependence of the hybridization with the states $-260$ meV, indicating that similar effect could be the reason for discrepancy between the heavy masses in specific heat and light ones in Shubnikov de Haas oscillations observed in other heavy fermion materials.

Title: Wannier interpolation of spin accumulation coefficient
Authors: Atsuo Shitade, Emi Minamitani
Abstract: The spin Hall (SH) effect is widely understood as a phenomoenon in which spin current flows perpendicular to an electric field. In the presence of a spin-orbit coupling, however, spin current is ambiguous, and the SH conductivity depends on the definition of spin current. In this article, we develop an \textit{ab initio} computational scheme for the spin accumulation coefficient, which characterizes the spin accumulation and would be an alternative indicator of the SH effect. The proposed method has been implemented into an open-source software Wannier90 and serves high-precision \textit{ab initio} research on the SH effect.

Title: Open system dynamics in linear-time beyond the wide-band limit
Authors: Yaroslav Pavlyukh, Riku Tuovinen
Abstract: Nonequilibrium heat transport in quantum systems coupled to wide-band embeddings provides a striking example of the limitations of the generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz (GKBA), while solving the full two-time Kadanoff-Baym equations remains computationally prohibitive. To address this challenge, we propose an iterated solution to the reconstruction problem, resulting in a time-linear evolution scheme involving 14 correlators for systems with narrow-band embeddings. This approach eliminates GKBA-related artifacts and resolves convergence issues associated with the wide-band limit. Furthermore, it enables the calculation of energy- and time-resolved currents, facilitating the modeling of heat flows in quantum systems and energy- and time-resolved photoemission experiments, all at significantly reduced computational cost.

Title: Contact value theorem for electric double layers with modulated surface charge density
Authors: Ladislav Šamaj
Abstract: The contact value theorem was originally derived for Coulomb fluids of mobile charged particles in thermal equilibrium, in the presence of interfaces carrying a {\em uniform} surface charge density and in the absence of dielectric discontinuities. It relates the pressure (the effective force) between two parallel electric double layers to the particle number density and the surface charge density at the interface, separately for each of the two electric double layers. In this paper, we generalise the contact value theorem to electric double layers with interfaces carrying a {\em modulated} surface charge density. The derivation is based on balance of forces exerted on interfaces. The relevance of particular terms of the contact value theorem is tested on an exactly solvable two-dimensional Coulomb system with counterions only at the coupling constant $\Gamma=2$.

Title: Crossover from Wannier-Stark localization to charge density waves for interacting spinless fermions in one dimension
Authors: Nair Aucar Boidi, Amnon Aharony, Ora Entin-Wohlman, Karen Hallberg, Cesar Proetto
Abstract: We study spinless fermions on a finite chain with nearest-neighbor repulsion and in the presence of a Wannier-Stark linearly-varying electric field potential. In the absence of the interaction, the eigenstates are localized for the system's sizes larger than the localization length. We present several analytical expressions for the localization length, which is proportional to the inverse of the electric field. Using the density matrix renormalization group numerical technique, we observe that the ground state exhibits a decrease of the occupation on the chain sites from the `bulk', with occupation 1, to the vacuum, with occupation 0. The width of this intermediate `edge' region is also inversely proportional to the electric field, increasing linearly with the strength of the nearest-neighbor repulsion. For strong interactions, the occupations in the intermediate region exhibit a charge density wave. We also present the local density of states for sites in the `edge' region. For the non-interacting case, the spectrum shows an increasing energy-localized structure as the field is increased, which is a consequence of the uniform energy distribution of the localized states (Wannier-Stark ladder). This structure survives for small interactions, and it smears out in the strongly interacting limit. Experimental variations of the slope of the potential (the electric field) on cold atom chains may test these predictions.

Title: Anomalous Knudsen effect signaling long-lived modes in 2D electron gases
Authors: Grigory A. Starkov, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: Proper analysis of electron collisions in two spatial dimensions leads to the conclusion, that the odd harmonics of the electron distribution function decay much slower than the even ones at finite temperatures. The number of long-lived odd harmonics quickly shrinks with increasing temperature. Focusing on a channel geometry with boundary scattering, we show that such behavior of the odd decay rates leads to a characteristic behaviour of the conductance that we dub anomalous Knudsen effect: it initially grows with temperature but then starts to decrease, forming a peak. Further increase of the temperature forces the conductance to grow again due to the Gurzhi effect, associated with the crossover from ballistic to hydrodynamic transport. The simultaneous observation of the Gurzhi dip preceded by the anomalous Knudsen peak constitutes a particular signature of the long-lived modes in 2D electron transport at low temperatures.

Title: Sign-reversal and non-monotonicity of chirality-related anomalous Hall effect in highly conductive metals
Authors: Ryunosuke Terasawa, Masafumi Udagawa, Hiroaki Ishizuka
Abstract: The non-monotonic temperature dependence and sign reversal of chirality-related anomalous Hall effect in highly conductive metals are studied. Through the analysis of scattering rate, we find that the non-monotonicity and sign reversal have two major origins: (1) competition between the contribution from short-range and long-range spin correlations and (2) non-monotonic spin correlation in the high field. The former mechanism gives rise to non-monotonic temperature dependence in a wide range of electron density and, in some cases, a sign reversal of Hall resistivity as the temperature decreases. On the other hand, the latter mechanism is responsible for the sign reversal of Hall conductivity in the high field, which sign reversal generally occurs in magnets with antiferromagnetic interactions. The results demonstrate how the Hall effect reflects local spin correlation and provide insights into the mechanism of non-monotonicity and sign reversal of the anomalous Hall effect by spin chirality.

Title: The non-Abelian geometry, topology, and dynamics of a nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger ladder
Authors: Ziyu Zhou, Zhi-Cong Xu, Li-Jun Lang
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity breaks down the adiabaticity and naturally leads to the non-Abelian behaviors in multi-band systems. Here we consider a multi-band, non-Hermitian ladder model with the two legs being the nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains. We thoroughly study how the non-Abelian geometry, topology, and dynamics emerge in this model at the onset of inter-leg coupling. Under periodic boundary conditions, by defining a gauge-invariant winding number for chiral symmetric systems, we analytically give the exact topological phase diagram. With the aid of underlying symmetries generalized for non-Hermitian systems, we further refine the phase diagram by the geometry of band structure. In the pseudo-Hermitian symmetric regime, we find that the stable non-Abelian dynamics of a Bloch state under an external constant force can be well described in some conditions of the force by the Wilson line constructed for non-Hermitian systems. Under open boundary conditions, we also find that the bulk-boundary correspondence survives in the thermodynamic limit but breaks down for finite-size systems with the leg-dependent non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), demonstrating the so-called critical NHSE, of which the decaying length of the bulk skin modes $\xi$ varies with the system size $L$ and is numerically verified to satisfy the scale-free power law $\xi\propto L$. Our work may stimulate more focuses on the non-Abelian properties of the non-Hermitian/open quantum systems.

Title: Optical orientation of excitons and charged carriers in MAPbI$_3$ perovskite single crystals in the orthorhombic phase
Authors: Nataliia E. Kopteva, Dmitri R. Yakovlev, Eyüp Yalcin, Ilya A. Akimov, Mladen Kotur, Bekir Turedi, Dmitry N. Dirin, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Manfred Bayer
Abstract: Optical orientation of exciton and carrier spins by circularly polarized light is the basic phenomenon in the spin physics of semiconductors. Here, we investigate spin orientation in MAPbI3 lead halide perovskite crystals at the cryogenic temperature of 1.6 K, where the material has an orthorhombic crystal structure. The recombination and spin dynamics of excitons and carriers are measured by time-resolved photoluminescence after circularly polarized excitation. The optical orientation of excitons reaches 85\%, which persists within their lifetime of 15-80 ps. This high orientation is maintained for excitation laser detunings from the exciton resonance to higher energies by up to 0.3 eV, then decreases and vanishes above 1.5 eV detuning. This indicates that the Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation mechanism based on inversion symmetry breaking is inactive in MAPbI3 crystals with orthorhombic symmetry. The optical orientation of localized and spatially-separated electrons and holes results in 40\% circular polarization of their emission. Their contributions can be identified from the complex spin beats dynamics in transverse magnetic field. The dynamics analysis gives values of the Landé g-factors of 2.83 for electrons and 0.54 for holes. Also, the magnetic-field-induced polarization of excitons and carriers is analyzed in magnetic fields up to 6 T, showing that their spin relaxation times are longer than their lifetimes. Namely, for the excitons, the spin relaxation time exceeds the lifetime by a factor of 6. We model the dynamics of optical orientation degree for cumulative contributions of excitons and carriers and show that the exciton recombination dynamics can control these dynamics. The polarized emission of excitons and localized carriers, produced by their polarization on Zeeman-split levels in magnetic fields, is modeled.

Title: Kerr non-linearity enhances the response of a graphene Josephson bolometer
Authors: Joydip Sarkar, Krishnendu Maji, Abhishek Sunamudi, Heena Agarwal, Priyanka Samanta, Anirban Bhattacharjee, Rishiraj Rajkhowa, Meghan P. Patankar, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Mandar M. Deshmukh
Abstract: Highly sensitive, broadband bolometers are of great interest because of their versatile usage in wide areas starting from dark matter search, radio astronomy, material science, and qubit readouts in cQED experiments. There have been different realizations of bolometers using superconducting thin films, nanowires, quantum dots, and various 2D materials in the recent past. The challenge is to have a single device that combines high sensitivity, broad bandwidth, a fast readout mechanism, and low noise. Here we demonstrate the first usage of a Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA) as a highly sensitive bolometer. Our key finding is the Kerr non-linearity of the JPA boosts the device's sensitivity. When the bolometer is biased in the non-linear regime, it enhances the sideband signals (~100 times), resulting in an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the linear regime. In the non-linear biasing of the device, we achieve a NEP~500 aW/sqrt(Hz). Our bolometer offers a fast detection scheme with a thermal time constant of 4.26 us and an intrinsic JPA time constant of 70 ns. Our device's broadband and fast operation are key and new compared to previously studied graphene-based bolometers. In our device, the gate voltage tunability and the possibility of multiplexing combined with the sensitive bolometric performance offer an opportunity for integrated quantum sensor arrays. Our work demonstrates a way forward to enhance the performance of quantum sensors based on 2D materials by leveraging the inherent non-linear response.

Title: Spin dynamics and magnetic excitations of quasi-1D spin chain Ca$_3$ZnMnO$_6$
Authors: Suheon Lee, D. T. Adroja, Qing Zhang, Gheorghe Lucian Pascut, Kristjan Haule, A.D. Hillier, M. Telling, W. Kockelmann, Sang-Wook Cheong, K.-Y. Choi
Abstract: To reveal the structure-property relationship in quasi-one-dimensional (1D) spin-chain system Ca$_3$ZnMnO$_6$, we present comprehensive results, combining basic physical characterizations such as muon spin relaxation/rotation ($\mu$SR), neutron powder diffraction (NPD), inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and theoretical calculations. Ca$_3$ZnMnO$_6$ features a dominant intrachain coupling $J_1$ and two distinct interchain interactions $J_2$ and $J_3$, and it undergoes antiferromagnetic ordering below $T_{\mathrm{N}}=25$~K, as revealed by dc magnetic susceptibility and specific-heat measurements. Zero-field $\mu$SR shows persistent spin dynamics below $T_{\mathrm{N}}$, suggesting unconventional magnetic excitations in the ordered state. NPD results indicate a commensurate magnetic ground state with a propagation vector $\mathbf{k}=0$, where the Mn spins lie in the $ab$-plane. INS spectra display dispersive magnetic excitations extending up to about 5~meV, with an energy gap smaller than 0.5~meV. Notably, these spectra exhibit three-dimensional (3D) gapped features rather than the expected 1D behavior, yet spin-wave dispersion analysis confirms an underlying quasi-1D energy hierarchy. We discuss this apparent paradox of 3D-like magnetic excitations in a quasi-1D system in terms of the energy hierarchy modified by nonmagnetic-ion substitution and finite-temperature first-principles calculations. We also suggest that Ca$_3$ZnMnO$_6$ could be a potential candidate for an M-type altermagnet.

Title: Discovery of a large magnetic nonlinear Hall effect in an altermagnet
Authors: Lei Han, Xizhi Fu, Cheng Song, Yuxiang Zhu, Xiaokang Li, Zengwei Zhu, Hua Bai, Ruiyue Chu, Jiankun Dai, Shixuan Liang, Junwei Liu, Feng Pan
Abstract: Since Edwin Halls groundbreaking discovery of the Hall effect in 1879, magnetism, spin, and quantization have been expanding the scope of Hall effects, continuously driving transformative progress in science and technology. Among them, the latest nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), where longitudinal electric field tunes quantum geometry to generate nonlinear Hall voltage, attracts wide attention as a sensitive probe of topological phases across a wide range of materials. Here, we report a new Hall effect member: the magnetic nonlinear Hall effect (MNLHE), characterized by a quadratic Hall conductivity dependence on magnetic field, rather than electric field as in NLHE. This finding relies on an altermagnet, Mn5Si3 thin film, whose alternating-sign Berry curvatures ensure higher-order MNLHE clearly distinguishable from the first-order anomalous Hall effect. The observed quadratic dependence originates from chiral next-nearest-neighbor hopping processes that acquire magnetic-exchange-driven Zeeman energies and Haldane-like chiral flux phases. Remarkably, this MNLHE is non-analytic, as reversing the magnetic field flips the alternating spin-splitting bands and reverses the hopping chirality, which is absent in traditional NLHE. Beyond offering a distinctive transport fingerprint for altermagnet Mn5Si3 thin film, this MNLHE is large and unsaturated up to 60 T, providing opportunities for pulsed high-field sensing technologies in both fundamental researches and engineering applications.

Title: Observation of non-Hermitian topological disclination states and charge fractionalization
Authors: Ruifeng Li, Rimi Banerjee, Subhaskar Mandal, Da Li, Yang Long, Tianchi Ma, Jianwei Liu, Gui-Geng Liu, Yidong Chong, Baile Zhang, Er-Ping Li
Abstract: There has been significant interest in exploring topological disclination states, which effectively probe the band topology of the host material beyond the conventional bulk-edge correspondence. While most studies in this area have primarily focused on Hermitian systems, recent theoretical work predicts that non-Hermiticity can drive topological phase transitions and host topological disclination states associated with fractional charge. However, no experimental observations have been reported to date. Here, we report the first experimental observation of topological disclination states in electric circuits, induced solely by gain and loss. Through admittance matrix measurements and eigenstate analysis, we confirm their emergence and compute the corresponding fractional charge. Moreover, the disclination mode profile and localization effect can be directly visualized via monochromatic field excitation. Additionally, we demonstrate the emergence of degenerate zero-energy topological disclination states, devoid of fractional charge, in distinct non-Hermitian geometries. Our findings open the possibility of non-Hermiticity-induced fractional charges in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices, which may pave the way for advancements in active topological photonic devices.

Title: Scaling corrections in driven critical dynamics: Application to a two-dimensional dimerized quantum Heisenberg model
Authors: Jing-Wen Liu, Shuai Yin, Yu-Rong Shu
Abstract: Driven critical dynamics in quantum phase transitions holds significant theoretical importance, and also practical applications in fast-developing quantum devices. While scaling corrections have been shown to play important roles in fully characterizing equilibrium quantum criticality, their impact on nonequilibrium critical dynamics has not been extensively explored. In this work, we investigate the driven critical dynamics in a two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg model. We find that in this model the scaling corrections arising from both finite system size and finite driving rate must be incorporated into the finite-time scaling form in order to properly describe the nonequilibrium scaling behaviors. In addition, improved scaling relations are obtained from the expansion of the full scaling form. We numerically verify these scaling forms and improved scaling relations for different starting states using the nonequilibrium quantum Monte Carlo algorithm.

Title: Two-Dimensional Lattice-Gas Model for Methane Clathrate Hydrates: Comparative Analysis with Experiments and Three-Dimensional Simulations
Authors: Julian Juan, Maria E. Pronsato, Antonio J. Ramirez-Pastor, Pablo Longone
Abstract: Methane clathrate hydrates, particularly those with an sI structure, are significant due to their potential as energy resources and their impact on gas pipelines. In this study, a two-dimensional (2D) lattice-gas model is employed to investigate the main thermodynamic properties of methane clathrate hydrates. The proposed framework is validated through comparison with experimental data and more advanced three-dimensional (3D) simulations. Adsorption isotherms, dissociation enthalpy and phase stability of the sI structure are evaluated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. The 2D adsorption isotherms closely align with both experimental data and 3D simulations, demonstrating the 2D model's ability to precisely represent both rigid and flexible sI structures. The dissociation enthalpy calculated using our approach (76.4 kJ/mol) excellently matches the experimental value (78 kJ/mol), confirming the model's accuracy. Furthermore, the phase diagram obtained from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation shows very good agreement with experimental data between 260 and 290 K, though deviations are observed above 290 K. These findings underscore the effectiveness and robustness of the 2D model in studying methane clathrate hydrates and suggest its potential applicability for investigating other guest species and hydrate structures.

Title: Linear-limit aging times of three monoalcohols
Authors: Jan Philipp Gabriel, Jeppe C. Dyre, Tina Hecksher
Abstract: This paper presents data for the physical aging of the three monoalcohols 2-ethyl-1-butanol, 5-methyl-2-hexanol, and 1-phenyl-1-propanol. Aging is studied by monitoring how the dielectric loss at a fixed frequency in the kHz range equilibrates upon temperature jumps of a few Kelvin's magnitude from equilibrium to equilibrium. The three alcohols differ in the Debye relaxation strength and how much the Debye relaxation time is different from that of the $\alpha$ process. We first demonstrate that single-parameter aging describes all data well and proceed to use this to identify linear-limit normalized aging relaxation functions. From the Laplace transform of these functions, the linear-limit aging loss-peak angular frequency defines the inverse of the linear aging relaxation time. This allows for a comparison to the temperature dependence of the Debye and $\alpha$ dielectric relaxation times of the three monoalcohols. We conclude that the aging response for 5-methyl-2-hexanol and 2-ethyl-1-butanol follows the $\alpha$ relaxation, not on the Debye process, while no definite conclusion can be reached for 1-phenyl-1-propanol because the Debye and $\alpha$ relaxations are here too merged to be distinguished.

Title: Chirality-induced spin selectivity based on orbital Edelstein effect in an analytically solvable model
Authors: Börge Göbel, Lennart Schimpf, Ingrid Mertig
Abstract: Chirality-induced spin selectivity, a phenomenon wherein chiral structures selectively determine the spin polarization of electron currents flowing through the material, has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in areas such as spintronics, enantioseparation, and catalysis. The underlying physical effect is the Edelstein effect that converts charge to angular momentum but the precise mechanism remains yet to be understood. Here, we introduce the minimal model for explaining the phenomenon based on the orbital Edelstein effect. We consider inter-site contributions to the current-induced orbital angular momentum and reveal the underlying mechanism by analytically calculating the Edelstein susceptibilities in a tight-binding and Boltzmann approach. While the orbital angular momentum is directly generated by the chirality of the crystal, the spin contribution of each spin-split band pair relies on spin-orbit coupling. Using tellurium as an example, we show that the orbital contribution surpasses the spin contribution by orders of magnitude.

Title: FF7: A Code Package for High-throughput Calculations and Constructing Materials Database
Authors: Tiancheng Ma, Zihan Zhang, Shuting Wu, Defang Duan, Tian Cui
Abstract: Decades accumulation of theory simulations lead to boom in material database, which combined with machine learning methods has been a valuable driver for the data-intensive material discovery, i.e., the fourth research paradigm. However, construction of segmented databases and data reuse in generic databases with uniform parameters still lack easy-to-use code tools. We herein develop a code package named FF7 (Fast Funnel with 7 modules) to provide command-line based interactive interface for performing customized high-throughput calculations and building your own handy databases. Data correlation studies and material property prediction can progress by built-in installation-free artificial neural network module and various post processing functions are also supported by auxiliary module. This paper shows the usage of FF7 code package and demonstrates its usefulness by example of database driven thermodynamic stability high-throughput calculation and machine learning model for predicting the superconducting critical temperature of clathrate hydrides.

Title: Dipole-Mode Spectrum and Hydrodynamic Crossover in a Resonantly Interacting Two-Species Fermion Mixture
Authors: Zhu-Xiong Ye, Alberto Canali, Chun-Kit Wong, Marian Kreyer, Emil Kirilov, Rudolf Grimm
Abstract: Ultracold quantum-gas mixtures of fermionic atoms with resonant control of interactions offer a unique test-bed to explore few- and many-body quantum states with unconventional properties. The emergence of such strongly correlated systems, as for instance symmetry-broken superfluids, is usually accompanied by hydrodynamic collective behavior. Thus, experimental progress in this field naturally requires a deep understanding of hydrodynamic regimes. Here, we report on experiments employing a tunable Fermi-Fermi mixture of $^{161}$Dy and $^{40}$K near quantum degeneracy. We investigate the full spectrum of dipole modes across a Feshbach resonance and characterize the crossover from collisionless to deep hydrodynamic behavior in measurements of frequencies and damping rates. We compare our results with a theoretical model that considers the motion of the mass centers of the two species and we identify the contributions of friction and mean-field interaction. We show that one oscillating mode exists over the whole range of interactions, exhibiting striking changes of frequency and damping in the deep hydrodynamic regime. We observe the second oscillating mode to split into two purely exponential damping modes. One of these exponential modes shows very fast damping, faster than any other relevant timescale, and is largely insensitive against experimental imperfections. It provides an accurate measure for the interspecies drag effect, which generalizes the concept of spin drag explored in other experiments. We characterize the interspecies drag locally in terms of a microscopic friction coefficient and we discuss its unitarity-limited universal behavior on top of the resonance.

Title: Unraveling effects of competing interactions and frustration in vdW ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 nanoflake devices
Authors: Rajeswari Roy Chowdhury, Daiichi Kurebayashi, Jana Lustikova, Oleg A. Tretiakov, Shunsuke Fukami, Ravi Prakash Singh, Samik DuttaGupta
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets and devices have garnered significant attention owing to the stabilization of long range magnetic order down to atomic limit, and the prospect for novel quantum devices with unique functionalities. To achieve this objective, clarification of magnetotransport properties and understanding of the relevant interactions with lowering of dimensions are of extreme importance. Here, the magnetotransport properties of few atomic layer Fe3GeTe2 and (Co0.25Fe0.75)3GeTe2 nanoflake devices have been investigated. Magnetotransport investigations with applied magnetic field along the easy-axis shows anomalous Hall effect, while that for applied magnetic field along the hard-axis reveals an unusual behaviour. Atomistic calculations considering the presence of antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic and local symmetry-breaking interactions reveal critical role of magnetic frustration effect assisted by thermal fluctuations, leading to a non-zero scalar spin chirality manifesting in an unconventional Hall effect. The present result clarifies the underlying interactions in few-layer 2D vdW ferromagnetic material system, important for the understanding of non-collinear spin configurations in vdW magnets for 2D spintronic devices.

Title: Quantum anomalous Hall domains in a Quenched Topological Mott Insulator
Authors: Lara Ulčakar, Gal Lemut, Tomaž Rejec, Jernej Mravlje
Abstract: We study an interacting spinless quadratic band touching model that realizes a topological Mott insulating state. We quench the interaction from a value corresponding to the nematic insulator to that of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) ordered phase. We perform time-dependent Hartree-Fock simulations and show that after the quench the system realizes an excited Dirac semimetal state, which is however unstable and spontaneously evolves to a state with inhomogeneous nematic and QAH order parameters. The modulations form a stripe pattern that grows exponentially with time until the local Chern marker reaches unity. The alternating QAH order defines a domain structure with boundaries that host chiral sublattice currents.

Title: Energy dynamics in a class of local random matrix Hamiltonians
Authors: Klée Pollock, Jonathan D. Kroth, Nathan Pagliaroli, Thomas Iadecola, Jonathan Riddell
Abstract: Random matrix theory yields valuable insights into the universal features of quantum many-body chaotic systems. Although all-to-all interactions are traditionally studied, many interesting dynamical questions, such as transport of a conserved density, require a notion of spatially local interactions. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the few-body but large local Hilbert space dimension case, we develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of the energy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator of the energy density. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory.

Title: Disentangling the Effects of Curvature and Misorientation on the Shrinkage Behavior of Loop-Shaped Grain Boundaries
Authors: Fabrizio Camerin, Susana Marín-Aguilar, Tim Griffioen, Mathieu G. Baltussen, Roel P.A. Dullens, Berend van der Meer, Marjolein Dijkstra
Abstract: The material properties of polycrystals are strongly affected by the evolution and coarsening of their internal grain structures. Yet, studying this process is challenging due to the complex interactions within grain boundary networks. Here, we systematically investigate the shrinkage of isolated loop-shaped grain boundaries in 2D colloidal crystals. Unexpectedly, we find that shear coupling decreases with increasing grain misorientation, contrary to geometric predictions. This counterintuitive result is attributed to enhanced concurrent sliding driven by the annihilation of dislocations. Furthermore, by focusing on the evolution of the grain size, we reveal a transition in shrinkage kinetics between small and large loop sizes, offering an explanation for previously observed discrepancies in grain boundary mobility. These findings reveal a more intricate dependence of grain boundary behavior on curvature and misorientation than previously reported, offering new insights into polycrystal coarsening dynamics.

Title: Fluctuation thermometry of an atom-resolved quantum gas: Beyond the fluctuation-dissipation theorem
Authors: Maxime Dixmerias, Joris Verstraten, Cyprien Daix, Bruno Peaudecerf, Tim de Jongh, Tarik Yefsah
Abstract: Thermometry is essential for studying many-body physics with ultracold atoms. Accurately measuring low temperatures in these systems, however, remains a significant challenge due to the absence of a universal thermometer. Most widely applicable methods, such as fitting of in-situ density profiles or standard fluctuation thermometry, are limited by the requirement of global thermal equilibrium and inapplicability to homogeneous systems. In this work, we introduce a novel in-situ thermometry for quantum gases, leveraging single-atom resolved measurements via quantum gas microscopy, and demonstrate it on an ideal Fermi gas. By analyzing number fluctuations in probe volumes with approximately one atom on average, we extract both global and local temperatures over a broad dynamic range. Unlike traditional fluctuation thermometry, our method does not rely on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and is based instead on the exact relationship between number fluctuations and density-density correlations. In the low-temperature regime, it allows us to observe significant deviations from fluctuation-dissipation predictions, uncovering sub-extensive fluctuations. Our method is applicable to systems with arbitrary trapping potentials, requiring neither precise trap calibration nor global thermal equilibrium. This nearly universal thermometer for quantum gases overcomes key limitations of existing techniques, paving the way for more accurate and versatile temperature measurements in ultracold quantum systems.

Title: Revisiting ab-initio excited state forces from many-body Green's function formalism: approximations and benchmark
Authors: Rafael R. Del Grande, David A. Strubbe
Abstract: Ab initio techniques for studying the optical and vibrational properties of materials are well-established, but only a few recent studies have focused on the interaction between excitons and atomic vibrations. In this paper, we revisit the excited state forces method, which integrates results from GW/BSE and DFPT calculations to determine the gradient of the excited state energy. We explore its technical aspects, including convergence and the quality of approximations used. We successfully apply this method to investigate self-trapped excitons in LiF. The excited state forces method provides valuable insights into ionic dynamics in the excited state and the microscopic mechanism of exciton self-trapping.

Title: Stirring supercooled colloidal liquids at the particle scale
Authors: Piotr Habdas, Eric R. Weeks
Abstract: We study the decay of tangential velocity profiles with distance from a local disturbance in hard-sphere colloidal suspensions as the colloidal glass transition is approached. The disturbance, generated by a dimer of superparamagnetic particles rotated by an external magnetic field, enables a precise characterization of the system's response through confocal microscopy and tracking of individual particle dynamics. The tangential velocity profiles exhibit nearly exponential decay with distance. As particle density increases toward the colloidal glass transition, the characteristic length scale derived from exponential fits grows. We also observe that the colloidal particles slip against the rotating dimer, with less slip in samples which are closer to the glass transition.

Title: Observation of a dynamic magneto-chiral instability in photoexcited tellurium

Abstract: In a system of charged chiral fermions driven out of equilibrium, an electric current parallel to the magnetic field can generate a dynamic instability by which electromagnetic waves become amplified. Whether a similar instability can occur in chiral solid-state systems remains an open question. Using time-domain terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy, we detect signatures of what we dub a ``dynamic magneto-chiral instability" in elemental tellurium, a structurally chiral crystal. Upon transient photoexcitation in a moderate external magnetic field, tellurium emits THz radiation consisting of coherent modes that amplify over time. An explanation for this amplification is proposed using a theoretical model based on a dynamic instability of electromagnetic waves interacting with infrared-active oscillators of impurity acceptor states in tellurium to form an amplifying polariton. Our work not only uncovers the presence of a magneto-chiral instability but also highlights its promise for THz-wave amplification in chiral materials.

Myriads of proteins participate in elaborate networks of interactions and perform chemical activities coordinating the life of cells. To perform these often amazing tasks, proteins must move and we must think of them as dynamic ensembles of three dimensional structures formed first by folding the polypeptide chains so as to minimize the conflicts between the interactions of their constituent amino acids. It is apparent however that, even when completely folded, not all conflicting interactions have been resolved so the structure remains "locally frustrated". Over the last decades it has become clearer that this local frustration is not just a random accident but plays an essential part of the inner workings of protein molecules. We will review here the physical origins of the frustration concept and review evidence that local frustration is important for protein physiology, protein-protein recognition, catalysis and allostery. Also, we highlight examples showing how alterations in the local frustration patterns can be linked to distinct pathologies. Finally we explore the extensions of the impact of frustration in higher order levels of organization of systems including gene regulatory networks and the neural networks of the brain.

Title: Paper-based colorimetric sensor for detection of chloride anions in water using an epoxy-silver nanocomposite
Authors: Alfredo Franco, Celso Velásquez-Ordoñez, Miguel Ojeda-Martínez, María Ojeda-Martínez, Enrique Barrera-Calva, Víctor Rentería-Tapia
Abstract: An epoxy-silver nanocomposite printed on paper was prepared for colorimetric detection of chloride anions (Cl$^-$) in aqueous solution. This paper-based sensor provides a promising platform with attractive advantages such as simple fabrication, intense colors, fast naked-eye response, and high specificity toward Cl$^-$ detection. The sensor undergoes a color change from yellow-orange to chestnut-brown in the presence of water and turns to green-brown in the presence of Cl$^-$. A good linear relationship ($R^2$=0.9754) between logarithmic Cl$^-$ concentration and the extinction intensity difference at 515 nm was observed at concentrations in the 20-400 mM range with a limit of detection (LOD) of 14 mM, far beyond the usual concentrations at which most of the Cl$^-$ colorimetric sensors are limited. It was also proposed a sensing mechanism based on the oxidative etching of anisotropic silver nanoparticles (from 20 to 250 nm) by Cl$^-$ and subsequent formation of chain-like aggregates, resulting in strong interparticle plasmonic coupling. This paper-based sensor can distinguish Cl$^-$ from other ions such as F$^{-}$, OH$^{-}$, NO$_{3}^{-}$, SO$_{4}^{2-}$, HPO$_{4}^{2-}$, H$_{2}$PO$_{4}^{-}$, H$^{+}$, K$^{+}$, Na$^{+}$, NH$_{4}^{+}$, Zn$^{2+}$, and Co$^{2+}$ and from mixtures of these ions. The nanosensor was also tested to recognize Cl$^{-}$ in seawater and a commercial electrolyte solution, even using volumes as small as 4 $\mu$L, suggesting its easy inclusion in portable devices. This novel colorimetric platform is undoubtedly useful for recognizing Cl$^-$ in environmental and physiological systems.

Title: Analysis of Diffusion Models for Manifold Data
Authors: Anand Jerry George, Rodrigo Veiga, Nicolas Macris
Abstract: We analyze the time reversed dynamics of generative diffusion models. If the exact empirical score function is used in a regime of large dimension and exponentially large number of samples, these models are known to undergo transitions between distinct dynamical regimes. We extend this analysis and compute the transitions for an analytically tractable manifold model where the statistical model for the data is a mixture of lower dimensional Gaussians embedded in higher dimensional space. We compute the so-called speciation and collapse transition times, as a function of the ratio of manifold-to-ambient space dimensions, and other characteristics of the data model. An important tool used in our analysis is the exact formula for the mutual information (or free energy) of Generalized Linear Models.

Title: Derivation and thermodynamiclly consistent coupling of a Debye-H\"uckel type energy to a steric electrolyte model and application to the apparent molar volume and phase boundaries
Authors: Wolfgang Dreyer, Rüdiger Müller
Abstract: We propose to determine the size parameters of a steric electrolyte model from the experimental data of apparent molar volume obtained from mass density measurements. Thereby, we avoid the difficulties associated with modeling the complex structure of the double layer. To this end, we derive a Debye-Hückel-like model of the electric ion-ion interaction for non-constant dielectric susceptibility, which does not depend on any kind of charging process due to its foundation in the general framework of non-equilibrium electro-thermodynamics. The derivation, however, leads to a novel thermodynamic consistency condition for the temperature dependence of the susceptibility. Due to its contributions to the total pressure, the consistent coupling of this new contribution to the free energy requires subtle modifications in the derivation of the simple mixing model for electrolytes. The coupled model is then applied to the apparent molar volume for various related monovalent salts over a wider range of salt concentrations and temperatures, and classical tests of the electrolyte theory at phase boundaries are investigated.

Title: Symmetry Properties of Quantum Dynamical Entropy
Authors: Eric D. Schultz, Keiichiro Furuya, Laimei Nie
Abstract: We investigate the relation between the Alicki-Fannes-Lindblad (AFL) quantum dynamical entropy and quantum symmetries. We show that, while the cumulative AFL entropy generally saturates to the dimensional bound at late times for chaotic dynamics, this saturation value is distinctively lower when the partitions (measurements) respect the symmetries. We provide rigorous analysis to this lowered value in three cases: Abelian symmetries, anticommuting unitaries, and non-Abelian symmetries. We further support our analytical results with numerical simulations of the perturbed quantum cat maps. Our findings highlight the complex relationship between the cumulative AFL entropy and symmetries, and suggest that caution is needed when interpreting it as an indicator of quantum chaos.

Title: Fermions and the Renormalisation Group at Large N
Authors: Charlie Cresswell-Hogg, Daniel F. Litim
Abstract: We investigate fermionic quantum field theories using functional renormalisation. In the limit of many fermion flavours $N$, we demonstrate that theories have exact solutions for their quantum effective actions given by quasi-local interaction functionals of fermion bilinears. The structure implies that local potential approximations are exact, exactly solvable, and that field anomalous dimensions vanish. Theories with non-trivial anomalous dimensions may also arise under conditions that are identified. We further demonstrate that higher derivative interactions are inevitably induced by point-like ones, including at large-$N$. The local potential flows for fermionic theories with the most general $U(N)$ symmetric interactions are provided. For sample theories with scalar, pseudo-scalar, vector, or axial-vector interactions, we identify conformal fixed points, scaling dimensions, conformal manifolds, and quantum-induced shifts in scaling dimensions of higher derivative interactions. We also study fermion mass generation, and subleading modifications due to finite $N$ corrections. Implications for conformal field theories, and applications in condensed matter and particle physics are indicated.

Title: Lattice stitching by eigenvector continuation for Holstein polaron
Authors: Elham Torabian, Roman V. Krems
Abstract: Simulations of lattice particle - phonon systems are fundamentally restricted by the exponential growth of the number of quantum states with the lattice size. Here, we demonstrate an algorithm that constructs the lowest eigenvalue and eigenvector for the Holstein model in extended lattices from eigenvalue problems for small, independent lattice segments. This leads to exponential reduction of the computational Hilbert space and allows applications of variational quantum algorithms to particle - phonon interactions in large lattices. We illustrate that the ground state of the Holstein polaron in the entire range of electron - phonon coupling, from weak to strong, and the lowest phonon frequency ($\omega/t = 0.1$) considered by numerical calculations to date can be obtained from a sequence of up to four-site problems. When combined with quantum algorithms, the present approach leads to a dramatic reduction of required quantum resources. We show that the ground state of the Holstein polaron in a lattice with 100 sites and 32 site phonons can be computed by a variational quantum eigensolver with 11 qubits.

Title: Towards Accurate Mixed Quantum Classical Simulations of Vibrational Polaritonic Chemistry
Authors: Muhammad R. Hasyim, Arkajit Mandal, David R. Reichman
Abstract: Interest in vibrational polaritonic chemistry, where ground-state chemical kinetics are modified via confined optical modes in a cavity, has surged in recent years. Although models have been developed to understand cavity-modified reactions, fully quantum mechanical simulations remain out of reach for the collective regime that involves many molecules, a critical aspect of the phenomenon. Mixed quantum-classical (MQC) simulations offer a scalable alternative, but their accuracy requires testing and potential improvements even in the single-molecule limit. In this work, we take this step by first introducing the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) to address the limitations of traditional MQC methods. Second, we incorporate a quantum treatment of the cavity mode, moving beyond the classical approximations often employed in previous studies. Results for a single-molecule model of vibrational polaritonic chemistry show that combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode yields the most accurate rates. However, this scheme may produce different long-time population dynamics at zero coupling depending on whether the cavity mode is quantized; a problem known as size-inconsistency in MASH. We address this problem proposing the $\epsilon$-MASH approach, which forbids hopping between states with negligible nonadiabatic couplings (NACs). Combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode thus provides a promising approach for scalable and accurate MQC simulations in the collective regime.

Title: Experimental realization of a SU(3) color-orbit coupling in an ultracold gas
Authors: Chetan S. Madasu, Chirantan Mitra, Lucas Gabardos, Ketan D. Rathod, Thomas Zanon-Willette, Christian Miniatura, Frederic Chevy, Chi Kwong, David Wilkowski
Abstract: Spin-orbit interaction couples the spin of a particle to its motion and leads to spin-induced transport phenomena such as spin-Hall effects and Chern insulators. In this work, we extend the concept of internal-external state coupling to higher internal symmetry, exploring features beyond the established spin-orbit regime. We couple suitable resonant laser beams to a gas of ultracold atoms, thereby inducing artificial SU(3) non-Abelian gauge fields that act on a degenerate ground state manifold comprised of three dark states. We demonstrate the inherent all-state connectivity of SU(3) systems by performing targeted geometric transformations. Then, we investigate color-orbit coupling, an extension of SU(2) spin-orbit coupling to SU(3) systems. We reveal a rich dynamical interplay between three distinct oscillation frequencies, which possesses interesting analogies with neutrino oscillations and quark mixing mechanisms. In the future, the system should provide a testbed for exploring topological properties of SU(3) systems.

Title: Geometric origin of self-intersection points in non-Hermitian energy spectra
Authors: Jinghui Pi, Chenyang Wang, Yong-Chun Liu, Yangqian Yan
Abstract: Unlike Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian energy spectra under periodic boundary conditions can form closed loops in the complex energy plane, a phenomenon known as point gap topology. In this paper, we investigate the self-intersection points of such non-Hermitian energy spectra and reveal their geometric origins. We rigorously demonstrate that these self-intersection points result from the intersection of the auxiliary generalized Brillouin zone and the Brillouin zone in one-band systems, as confirmed by an extended Hatano-Nelson model. This finding is further generalized to multi-band systems, illustrated through a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Moreover, we address multiple self-intersection points and derive the geometric conditions for general n-fold self-intersection points. Our results enhance the fundamental understanding of generic non-Hermitian quantum systems and provide theoretical support for further experimental investigations of energy self-intersection points.

Title: Why ETH? On thermalization and locality
Authors: Stefan Eccles
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is foundational to modern discussions of thermalization in closed quantum systems. In this work, we expand on traditional explanations for the prevalence of ETH by emphasizing the role of operator locality. We introduce an operator-specific perturbation problem that can be thought of as a means of understanding the onset or breakdown of ETH for specific classes of operators in a given system. We derive explicit functional forms for the off-diagonal variances of operator matrix elements for typical local operators under various `scrambling ansatzes', expressed in terms of system parameters and parameters of the corresponding perturbation problem. We provide simple tests and illustrations of these ideas in chaotic spin chain systems.

Title: Explicit Pfaffian Formula for Amplitudes of Fermionic Gaussian Pure States in Arbitrary Pauli Bases
Authors: M. A. Rajabpour, M. A. Seifi Mirjafarlou
Abstract: The explicit computation of amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics, with significant implications for quantum tomography, experimental studies, and quantum dynamics. These calculations are essential for analyzing complex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation probabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in non-standard bases, where exact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In particular, having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem 1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a Pfaffian of a matrix based on qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a recursive relation (Theorem 2) that links the amplitudes of systems with different qubit counts, enabling scalable calculations for large systems. Together, these results provide a versatile framework for applications in global entanglement, Shannon-Rényi entropy, formation probabilities, and quantum tomography, significantly expanding the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems.

Title: Programming optical-lattice Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulators
Authors: Cristian Tabares, Christian Kokail, Peter Zoller, Daniel González-Cuadra, Alejandro González-Tudela
Abstract: Fermionic atoms in optical lattices provide a native implementation of Fermi-Hubbard (FH) models that can be used as analog quantum simulators of many-body fermionic systems. Recent experimental advances include the time-dependent local control of chemical potentials and tunnelings, and thus enable to operate this platform digitally as a programmable quantum simulator. Here, we explore these opportunities and develop ground-state preparation algorithms for different fermionic models, based on the ability to implement both single-particle and many-body, high-fidelity fermionic gates, as provided by the native FH Hamiltonian. In particular, we first design variational, pre-compiled quantum circuits to prepare the ground state of the natively implemented FH model, with significant speedups relative to competing adiabatic protocols. Besides, the versatility of this variational approach enables to target extended FH models, i.e., including terms that are not natively realized on the platform. As an illustration, we include next-nearest-neighbor tunnelings at finite dopings, relevant in the context of $d$-wave superconductivity. Furthermore, we discuss how to approximate the imaginary-time evolution using variational fermionic circuits, both as an alternative state-preparation strategy, and as a subroutine for the Quantum Lanczos algorithm to further improve the energy estimation. We benchmark our protocols for ladder geometries, though they can be readily applied to 2D experimental setups to address regimes beyond the capabilities of current classical methods. These results pave the way for more efficient and comprehensive explorations of relevant many-body phases with existing programmable fermionic quantum simulators.

Authors: Choon-Lin Ho
Abstract: Kramers escape from a metastable state in the presence of both thermal and quantum fluctuations under strong damping is treated as a thermally activated process in a quantum modified semiclassical potential. Dirac's time-dependent variational method together with the Jackiw-Kerman function is employed to derive the semiclassical potential.

Title: Viscoelasticity reduces the droplet size in mucosalivary film fragmentation during intense respiratory events
Authors: Mogeng Li, Youssef Saade, Stéphane Zaleski, Uddalok Sen, Pallav Kant, Detlef Lohse
Abstract: We examine the fundamental fluid dynamical mechanisms dictating the generation of bioaerosols in the human trachea during intense respiratory events such as coughing and sneezing, with an emphasis on the role played by the mucosalivary fluid viscoelasticity. An experimental investigation of the shear-induced fragmentation of a mucosalivary-mimetic fluid in a confined geometry reveals that viscoelastic liquids undergo atomization in a manner akin to Newtonian liquids -- via the formation of bag-like structures -- which ultimately rupture through the appearance of retracting holes on the bag surface. Droplets are produced via the unstable retraction of liquid rims bounding these holes. However, in comparison to Newtonian liquids, viscoelastic bags inflate to larger sizes -- implying thinner sheets and, consequently smaller droplets upon rupture. Numerical simulations support that the smaller droplets can be attributed to the thinner sheets, with a more uniform thickness, for viscoelastic bags prior to rupture. Hence, we highlight the role of the viscoelasticity in determining the thickness of the intermediate bag-like structures, which, in turn, govern the droplet size distribution of the expelled aerosol.

Title: In-context denoising with one-layer transformers: connections between attention and associative memory retrieval
Authors: Matthew Smart, Alberto Bietti, Anirvan M. Sengupta
Abstract: We introduce in-context denoising, a task that refines the connection between attention-based architectures and dense associative memory (DAM) networks, also known as modern Hopfield networks. Using a Bayesian framework, we show theoretically and empirically that certain restricted denoising problems can be solved optimally even by a single-layer transformer. We demonstrate that a trained attention layer processes each denoising prompt by performing a single gradient descent update on a context-aware DAM energy landscape, where context tokens serve as associative memories and the query token acts as an initial state. This one-step update yields better solutions than exact retrieval of either a context token or a spurious local minimum, providing a concrete example of DAM networks extending beyond the standard retrieval paradigm. Overall, this work solidifies the link between associative memory and attention mechanisms first identified by Ramsauer et al., and demonstrates the relevance of associative memory models in the study of in-context learning.

Title: A Method to Decipher "Genome" from Interatomic Cohesion in the Exploration for a "Central Dogma" Replacement in Material Science
Authors: Xinxu Zhang, Jiahao Wei, Hui Jia, Jiamin Liu, Guo Li, Ling Liu, Yulong Wu, Changlong Liu, Xiao-Dong Zhang, Yonghui Li
Abstract: In the ball-stick model, interatomic cohesions are considered "sticks". But enormous details and features of the "sticks" are usually oversimplified as indexed quantities or equivocated as geometry characteristics. These indexed quantities or geometry characteristics not only limit the explanatory capability to a few chemical/physical aspects but also eliminate generativity for expected resemblance. And these limitations can be related to the information loss during the conversion. Herein, inspired by the central dogma, a framework is introduced to compact interatomic cohesions into a detailed residue-by-residue "genome" with matched encoding/decoding tools. The framework fuses the quantum mechanical aspects, auto feature extraction, nanostructures and/or simulations, and generative models. As a proof of concept, the realization introduced in this work adopted bosonic/fermionic features, an autoencoder with image recognition processes, Density Functional Theory simulations, and a thiolate-protected gold nanocluster dataset. After repetitive modeling, validating, and analysis based on 26,528 simulated interatomic images, the interatomic cohesion can be almost losslessly encoded into an 8-value-genome, and the genome encoder-decoder pair is also obtained. The model is then automatically extended into a generative model which converts any arbitrary 8-value-genome to a bond image.

Title: Structural and magnetic properties of Fe-Co-C alloys with tetragonal deformation: a first-principle study
Authors: Wojciech Marciniak, Mirosław Werwiński (1) ((1) Institute of Molecular Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznań, Poland, (2) Institute of Physics, Poznań University of Technology, Poznań, Poland)
Abstract: Fe-Co alloys with induced tetragonal strain are promising materials for rare-earth-free permanent magnets. However, as ultrathin-film studies have shown, tetragonal Fe-Co structures tend to a rapid relaxation toward a cubic structure as the thickness of the deposited film increases. One of the main methods of inducing the stable strain in the bulk material is interstitial doping with small atoms, like B, C, or N. In this work, we present a full configuration space analysis in density functional theory approach for (Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_{16}$C supercells with a single C impurity in one of the octahedral interstitial positions and for the full range of Co concentrations $x$. We discuss all assumptions and considerations leading to calculated lattice parameters, mixing enthalpies, magnetic moments, and averaged magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies (MAE). We present a comprehensive qualitative analysis of the structural and magnetic properties' dependence on short- and long-range ordering parameters. We analyzed all unique Fe/Co atoms occupancies at all stoichiometric concentrations possible in 2x2x2 supercell based on 2-atom tetragonal representation. We rely on the thermodynamic averaging method and large sample count to obtain accurate MAE values. We reevaluate several chemical disorder approximation methods, including effective medium methods (virtual crystal approximation and coherent potential approximation) and special quasirandom structures method applied to Fe-Co-based alloys. We observe a structural phase transition from the body-centered tetragonal structure above 70% Co concentration and confirm the structural stability of Fe-Co-C alloys in the tetragonal range. We show the presence of a broad MAE maximum of around 50% Co concentration and notably high MAE values for Co content $x$ as low as 25%. In addition, we show a positive correlation between MAE and mixing enthalpy.

Title: Rigid clusters in shear-thickening suspensions: a nonequilibrium critical transition
Authors: Aritra Santra, Michel Orsi, Bulbul Chakraborty, Jeffrey F. Morris
Abstract: The onset and growth of rigid clusters in a two-dimensional (2D) suspension in shear flow are studied by numerical simulations. The suspension exhibits the lubricated-to-frictional rheology transition, but the key results here are for stresses above the levels that cause extreme shear-thickening. At large solid fraction, $\phi$, but below the stress-dependent jamming fraction, we find a critical $\phi_{c}(\sigma,\mu)$ where $\sigma$ is a dimensionless shear stress and $\mu$ is the interparticle friction coefficient. For $\phi>\phi_c$, the proportion of particles in rigid clusters grows sharply, as $f_{\rm rig} \sim |\phi-\phi_{c}|^{\beta}$ with $\beta=1/8$. The fluctuations in the fraction of particles in rigid clusters yield a susceptibility measure $\chi_{\rm rig} \sim |\phi-\phi_{c}|^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma = 7/4$. The system is thus found to exhibit criticality. The results are shown to depend on an effective field $h(\mu)$, which provides data collapse near $\phi_c$ for both $f_{\rm rig}$ and $\chi_{\rm rig}$. This behavior occurs over a range of stresses, with $\phi_c(\sigma,\mu)$ increasing as the stress decreases.

Title: Distributed fixed resources exchanging particles: Phases of an asymmetric exclusion process connected to two reservoirs
Authors: Sourav Pal, Parna Roy, Abhik Basu
Abstract: We propose and study a conceptual one-dimensional model to explore how the combined interplay between fixed resources and particle exchanges between different parts of an extended system can affect the stationary densities in a current carrying channel connecting different parts of the system. To this end, we consider a model composed of a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) connecting two particle reservoirs without any internal dynamics but which can directly exchange particles between each other, ensuring nonvanishing currents in the steady states. The total particle number in the system that defines the "resources" available, although is kept constant by the model dynamics, can take any value independent of the model parameters that define the dynamics of the model. We show how the resulting phase diagrams of the model are controlled by the parameters, which define the various dynamical update rules together with the total available resources. These control parameters can be tuned to make the density on the TASEP lane globally uniform or piecewise continuous with localized domain walls, and can also control populations of the two reservoirs. In general, the phase diagrams are quite different from a TASEP with open boundaries. In the limit of large amount of resources, the phase diagrams in the plane of the control parameters become topologically identical to that for an open TASEP together with delocalization of domain walls.

Title: A Free Energy Model for the Plateau Shear Modulus in Thermosensitive Microgel Suspensions
Authors: Maxime Bergman, Yixuan Xu, José Muñéton Díaz, Zhang Chi, Thomas G. Mason, Frank Scheffold
Abstract: Polymer microgels exhibit intriguing macroscopic flow properties arising from their unique microscopic structure. Microgel colloids usually comprise a crosslinked polymer network with a radially decaying density profile, resulting in a dense core surrounded by a fuzzy corona. Notably, microgels synthesized from poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) are thermoresponsive, capable of adjusting their size and density profile based on temperature. Above the lower critical solution temperature ($T_\text{LCST} \sim 33$ $^\circ$C), the microgel's polymer network collapses, expulsing water through a reversible process. Conversely, below $33$ $^\circ$C, the microgel's network swells, becoming highly compressible and allowing overpacking to effective volume fractions exceeding one. Under conditions of dense packing, microgels undergo deformation in distinct stages: corona compression and faceting, interpenetration, and finally, isotropic compression. Each stage exhibits a characteristic signature in the dense microgel suspensions' yield stress and elastic modulus. Here, we introduce a model for the linear elastic shear modulus by minimizing a quasi-equilibrium free energy, encompassing all relevant energetic contributions. We validate our model by comparing its predictions to experimental results from oscillatory shear rheology tests on microgel suspensions at different densities and temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that combining macroscopic rheological measurements with the model allows for temperature-dependent characterization of polymer interaction parameters.

Title: Potential of mean force and underscreening of polarizable colloids in concentrated electrolytes
Authors: Emily Krucker-Velasquez, Martin Z. Bazant, Alfredo Alexander-Katz, James W. Swan
Abstract: This study uses advanced numerical methods to estimate the mean force potential (PMF) between charged, polarizable colloidal particles in dense electrolytes. We observe that when the Debye screening length, $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$, is below the hydrated ion size, the PMF shows discernible oscillations of purely electrostatic origin as opposed to chemical affinity, in addition to the expected decay in DLVO theory. Moreover, our findings suggest concentrated electrolytes are significantly less efficient at muting electrostatic interactions in electrostatically stabilized colloidal suspensions, potentially having significant implications for our understanding of colloidal stability and the forces that govern the behavior of concentrated charged soft matter systems beyond DLVO theory.

Title: Low-temperature thermal transport in moir\'e superlattices
Authors: Lukas P. A. Krisna, Takuto Kawakami, Mikito Koshino
Abstract: We calculate the phonon thermal conductivity of various moiré bilayer systems using a continuum approach and the semiclassical transport theory. When the twist angle is close to 0, we observe a significant reduction of thermal conductivity in a particular low-temperature regime. This reduction is attributed to a moiré-induced reconstruction of acoustic phonon bands and associated decrease of the group velocity. Conversely, in the zero temperature limit, the thermal conductivity is enhanced by moiré effect, surpassing the original values in non-moiré counterparts. These changes result in a characteristic temperature dependence which deviates from the quadratic behavior in intrinsic two-dimensional systems.

Title: Chemical control of self-assembly by the electrosolvation force
Authors: Sida Wang, Rowan Walker-Gibbons, Bethany Watkins, Binghui Lin, Madhavi Krishnan
Abstract: Self-assembly of matter in solution generally relies on attractive interactions that overcome entropy and drive the formation of higher-order molecular and particulate structures. Such interactions play key roles in a variety of contexts, e.g., crystallisation, biomolecular folding and condensation, pathological protein aggregation, pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. The electrosolvation force entails a new conceptual paradigm in the known palette of interactions that drive the spontaneous accretion and organisation of matter. However, an understanding of the underlying physical chemistry, and therefore the ability to exert control over and tune the interaction, remains incomplete. Here we demonstrate that this force arises from the structure of the interfacial electrolyte. Neutral molecules such as a different solvent, osmolytes or surfactants, can - even at very low concentrations in the medium - disrupt or reinforce pre-existing interfacial solvent structure, thereby furnishing unanticipated chemical tuning of the ability of matter to self-assemble. The observations further present unexpected mechanistic elements that may explain the impact of co-solvents and osmolytes on protein structure, stability and pathological protein condensation. Our findings shed new light on microscopic mechanisms that drive the emergence of order and structure from molecular to macroscopic scales in the solution phase.

Title: Cu NMR study of lightly doped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$
Authors: Marija Vučković, Ana Najev, Biqiong Yu, Takao Sasagawa, Nina Bielinski, Neven Barišić, Martin Greven, Damjan Pelc, Miroslav Požek
Abstract: We present a single crystal Cu NMR study of the cuprate superconductor La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ with hole doping levels between $x=2$\% and $8$\%. Measurements with short spin echo times enable us to systematically study the local properties of the electronic spin system in the region of the phase diagram where the material evolves from the insulating antiferromagnetic parent phase to the superconducting state. We find evidence for qualitative changes as the Sr concentration increases through $x=5$\% in both NMR spectra and relaxation times, which we interpret as signatures of a low-temperature transition from a state with disconnected metallic islands to a granular metal with tunneling between the grains. These results provide microscopic insight into the physics of a doped charge-transfer insulator in the presence of quenched substitutional disorder, indicate that a connectivity transition occurs, and demonstrate that complex nanoscale electronic phase separation is ubiquitous in LSCO around the doping level where superconductivity first appears in the phase diagram.

Title: Quasiperiodic Quadrupole Insulators
Authors: Raul Liquito, Miguel Gonçalves, Eduardo V. Castro
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators are an intriguing new family of topological states that host lower-dimensional boundary states. Concurrently, quasiperiodic systems have garnered significant interest due to their complex localization and topological properties. In this work we study the impact of quasiperiodic modulations on the paradigmatic Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, which hosts topological insulating phases with zero-energy corner modes. We find that the topological properties are not only robust to the quasiperiodic modulation, but can even be enriched. In particular, we unveil the first instance of a quasiperiodic induced second-order topological insulating phase. Furthermore, in contrast with disorder, we find that quasiperiodic modulations can induce multiple reentrant topological transitions, showing an intricate sequence of localization properties. Our results open a promising avenue for exploring the rich interplay between higher-order topology and quasiperiodicity.

Title: Superconductivity in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers
Authors: Jihang Zhu, Yang-Zhi Chou, Ming Xie, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: For the first time, robust superconductivity has been independently observed in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.

Title: Energy Window Muffin Tin Orbitals (EWMTO) and Energy Window Linear Muffin Tin orbitals (EWLMTO) within the Atomic Sphere Approximation (ASA)
Authors: Garry Goldstein
Abstract: In this work we propose two new, closely related, efficient basis sets for the electronic structure problem. The basis sets are based on the Muffin Tin Orbital (MTO) idea that the eigenstates of the Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian may we be expanded in terms of eigenstates of the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the so called Muffin Tin (MT) spheres and Bessel functions in the interstitial multiplied by appropriate spherical Harmonics. Here we use the fact that the solution to the finding the ground state electron density is most often found through an iterative process: where generically on the order of over twenty iterations are taken till the ground state electron density and energy converges to the lowest values allowed by the correlation and exchange functional. We use eigenstate information from the previous iteration loop to choose the energies of the basis set elements used to study the KS Hamiltonian. Furthermore within the Atomic Sphere Approximation (ASA) the energies of the Bessel functions do not matter, as they are cancelled out other than for boundary conditions, and are chosen at zero energy. This is an efficient method aimed at studying the electronic structure of materials with large unit cells especially if they are of close packed form where ASA is particularly accurate.

Title: Discovery of Dynamical Heterogeneity in a Supercooled Magnetic Monopole Fluid
Authors: Jahnatta Dasini, Chaia Carroll, Chun-Chih Hsu, Hiroto Takahashi, Jack Murphy, Sudarshan Sharma, Catherine Dawson, Fabian Jerzembeck, Stephen J. Blundell, Graeme Luke, J.C. Séamus Davis, Jonathan Ward
Abstract: Dynamical heterogeneity, in which transitory local fluctuations occur in the conformation and dynamics of constituent particles, is widely hypothesized to be essential to evolution of supercooled liquids into the glass state. Yet its microscopic spatiotemporal phenomenology has remained unobservable in virtually all molecular glass forming liquids. Because recent theoretical advances predict that corresponding dynamical heterogeneity could occur in supercooled magnetic monopole fluids, we searched for such phenomena in Dy2Ti2O7. By measuring its microsecond-resolved spontaneous magnetization fluctuations $M(t,T)$ we discovered a sharp bifurcation in monopole noise characteristics below $T \approx 1500$ mK, with the appearance of powerful spontaneous monopole current bursts. This intense dynamics emerges upon entering the supercooled monopole fluid regime, reaches maximum strength near $T \approx 500$ mK and then terminates along with coincident loss of ergodicity near $T \lesssim 250$ mK. Moreover, the four-point dynamical susceptibility $\chi_4(T, t)$ is observed directly and evolves as predicted when dynamical heterogeneity is present, clearly revealing its diverging length scales $\xi(T)$. This overall phenomenology greatly expands our empirical knowledge of supercooled monopole fluids and, more generally, demonstrates direct detection of the time sequence, magnitude, statistics and correlations of dynamical heterogeneity, access to which may greatly accelerate fundamental vitrification studies.

Title: Spin parallel transport and holonomy on a spherical two-dimensional electron gas
Authors: E.J. Rodríguez, A.A. Reynoso, J.P. Baltanás, D. Bercioux, D. Frustaglia
Abstract: The quantum conductance of flat (Euclidean) circuits subject to Rashba spin-orbit coupling shows a symmetric response to the inversion of the spin-orbit field in Aharonov-Casher interference patterns. Here, we show that this symmetry breaks down in curved (non-Euclidean) circuits defined on a spherical two-dimensional electron gas. We demonstrate that this is a consequence of parallel spin transport and holonomy on the surface of the sphere, and that a symmetric response can be recovered when considering the parallel transport condition as an offset. We discuss triangular circuits defined along geodesic arcs on the sphere as a case study, and generalize it to regular polygons and parallel curves of given latitude.

Title: Quasiperiodic pairing in graphene quasicrystals
Authors: Rasoul Ghadimi, Bohm-Jung Yang
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting instabilities of twisted bilayer graphene quasicrystals (TBGQC) obtained by stacking two monolayer graphene sheets with a $30^\circ$ relative twisting. The electronic energy spectrum of TBGQC contains periodic energy ranges (PER) and quasiperiodic energy ranges (QER), where the underlying local density of states (LDOS) exhibits periodic and quasiperiodic distribution, respectively. We found that superconductivity in the PER is a simple superposition of two monolayer superconductors. This is because, particularly near the charge neutrality point of TBGQC, the two layers are weekly coupled, leading to pairing instabilities with uniform distribution in real space. On the other hand, within QER, the inhomogeneous distribution of the LDOS enhances the superconducting instability with a non-uniform distribution of pairing amplitudes, leading to quasiperiodic superconductivity. Our study can qualitatively explain the superconductivity in recently discovered moiré quasicrystals, which show superconductivity in its QER.

Title: Sommerfeld-Bethe analysis of ZT in inhomogeneous thermoelectrics
Authors: Manaho Matsubara, Takahiro Yamamoto, Hidetoshi Fukuyama
Abstract: The development of good thermoelectric materials exhibiting high $ZT$ (=$\frac{PF}{\kappa} T$) requires maximizing power factor, $PF$, mainly governed by electrons, and minimizing thermal conductivity, $\kappa$, associated not only with electrons but also with phonons. In the present work, we focus on the GeTe and Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ as high $ZT$ materials with inhomogeneous structures and analyze both electrical conductivity, $L_{11}$, and Seebeck coefficient, $S$, with help of Sommerfeld-Bethe formula, resulting in understanding the temperature dependence of $PF$ and the identification of electrons contribution to thermal conductivity, $\kappa_{\rm el}$. Comparing the obtained $\kappa_{\rm el}$ and experimentally measured $\kappa$, the temperature dependence of phonons contribution to thermal conductivity, $\kappa_{\rm ph}=\kappa-\kappa_{\rm el}$, is inferred and analyzed based on the formula by Holland. Comparison of the GeTe and Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ with different types of crystal structures, i.e., GeTe being of a semiordered zigzag nanostructure like a disrupted herringbone structure while Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ of rather uniform amorphous structure, discloses that size effects on temperature dependence of $\kappa_{\rm ph}$ is large in the former, while very small in the latter. Hence, it is concluded that not only the size of the grain but also its shape has an important influence on $\kappa_{\rm ph}$ and then $ZT$.

Title: Stabilization of a two-dimensional quantum electron solid in perpendicular magnetic fields
Authors: M. Yu. Melnikov, D. G. Smirnov, A. A. Shashkin, S.-H. Huang, C. W. Liu, S. V. Kravchenko
Abstract: We find that the double-threshold voltage-current characteristics in the insulating regime in the ultra-clean two-valley two-dimensional electron system in SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum wells are promoted by perpendicular magnetic fields, persisting to an order of magnitude lower voltages and considerably higher electron densities compared to the zero-field case. This observation indicates the perpendicular-magnetic-field stabilization of the quantum electron solid.

Title: Orbital Hall effect in transition metals from first-principles scattering calculations
Authors: Max Rang, Paul J. Kelly
Abstract: We use first-principles scattering calculations based upon wave-function matching and implemented with a tight-binding MTO basis to evaluate the orbital Hall conductivity $\sigma_{\rm oH}$ for Ti, V, Cr, Cu and Pt metals with temperature-induced lattice disorder. Only interatomic fluxes of orbital angular momentum are included in these estimates; intraatomic fluxes which do not contribute to the transfer of angular momentum are explicitly excluded. The resistivity and orbital Hall angle are both found to be linear in temperature so $\sigma_{\rm oH}$ is at most weakly temperature dependent. The value of $\sigma_{\rm oH}$ we obtain for bulk Cr is $ \approx 2 \times 10^3 (\hbar/e) \, (\Omega \, {\rm cm})^{-1}$ which is substantially lower than previously obtained theoretical results but agrees well with experiment. In units of $10^3 (\hbar/e) (\Omega \, {\rm cm})^{-1}$, the values obtained for Ti, V and Pt are $5$, $6$ and $7$, respectively.

Title: Backbone exponent and annulus crossing probability for planar percolation
Authors: Pierre Nolin, Wei Qian, Xin Sun, Zijie Zhuang
Abstract: We report the recent derivation of the backbone exponent for 2D percolation. In contrast to previously known exactly solved percolation exponents, the backbone exponent is a transcendental number, which is a root of an elementary equation. We also report an exact formula for the probability that there are two disjoint paths of the same color crossing an annulus. The backbone exponent captures the leading asymptotic, while the other roots of the elementary equation capture the asymptotic of the remaining terms. This suggests that the backbone exponent is part of a conformal field theory (CFT) whose bulk spectrum contains this set of roots. Our approach is based on the coupling between SLE curves and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG), and the integrability of Liouville CFT that governs the LQG surfaces.

Title: A Thermodynamic Constraint for the Electronic Structure of Fe-Ni Alloys at Room And High-Temperature
Authors: Jonathan Paras, Antoine Allanore
Abstract: The measurement of the electronic structure of metal alloys is hampered by the in-applicability of conventional quantum oscillation measurements owing to electron scattering by thermal or alloy disorder. Recent advancements in the study of the electronic contribution to the entropy suggest a path to ground transport properties in alloy equilibrium thermodynamics. Fe-Ni represents an interesting test-case because it exhibits an intricate electronic structure, order-disorder transformations, and a large solid-solution region where equilibrium data can be obtained. Using cluster modeling, the electronic contribution to the entropy can be inferred from high-temperature thermodynamic data. Electronic transport property measurements can be used to independently evaluate the electronic contribution to the entropy. Reconciling these two approaches at high temperature supports this method to study electronic structure for metal alloys.

Title: Self-similar plasmonic nanolenses: mesoscopic ensemble averaging and chiral light-matter interactions
Authors: Nikolaos Kyvelos, N. Asger Mortensen, Xuezhi Zheng, Christos Tserkezis
Abstract: We investigate how the near-field enhancement of self-similar nanolenses, made of three plasmonic nanospheres with decreasing sizes and separations, is affected by quantum corrections in the optical response of the metal, and by fabrication imperfections related to the positioning of the spheres in the nanolens. In particular, we integrate mesoscopic phenomena, such as electron spill-in and -out and surface-enabled Landau damping, via the surface-response formalism, focusing particularly on the role of spill-out in alkali metals. In addition, we take realistic imperfections in the nanofabrication process into account, through numerical averaging of both far- and near-field spectra for large collections of nanolenses. Statistical analysis of hundreds of trimers shows that inevitable deviations from the perfectly aligned chain only slightly, if at all, impair the field enhancement, as long as the average misplacement is kept within 1 nm from the ideal situation. Wishing to explore whether such imperfections can be harvested for practical applications, we probe the potential for triggering chiral response. Our results verify that imperfect nanolenses can display considerable light-induced optical activity and circular dichroism, while providing a means to manipulate the optical chirality density. This highlights how promising the nanolensing effect is for chiral light-matter interactions. Nonetheless, we emphasize that quantification of chiral light-matter interactions can be largely affected by mesoscopic phenomena, which cannot be ignored when near-field quantities like optical chirality density are investigated.

Title: Pseudo Transitions in the Finite-Size Blume-Capel Model
Authors: Lei Shi, Wei Liu, Xiang Li, Xin Zhang, Fangfang Wang, Kai Qi, Zengru Di
Abstract: This article investigates the pseudo transitions of the Blume-Capel model on two-dimensional finite-size lattices. By employing the Wang-Landau sampling method and microcanonical inflection point analysis, we identified the positions of phase transitions as well as higher-order phase transitions. Through Metropolis sampling and canonical ensemble analysis, we determined the geometric characteristics of the system at these transition points. When the crystal field parameter $D$ exceeds 1.965, crossing the tricritical point, no third-order dependent phase transition is observed. However, a fourth-order independent transition was identified in the high-temperature region, and through Metropolis sampling analysis, a phase transition from the ordered paramagnetic phase to the disordered paramagnetic phase was confirmed, enhancing the phase diagram. Furthermore, the positions of the third-order phase transition obtained from both microcanonical and canonical analyses are consistent and mutually corroborative. We speculate that third-order dependent transitions vanish in the presence of strong first-order phase transitions.

Title: Field theory of non-Hermitian disordered systems
Authors: Ze Chen, Kohei Kawabata, Anish Kulkarni, Shinsei Ryu
Abstract: The interplay between non-Hermiticity and disorder gives rise to unique universality classes of Anderson transitions. Here, we develop a field-theoretical description of non-Hermitian disordered systems based on fermionic replica nonlinear sigma models. We classify the target manifolds of the nonlinear sigma models across all the 38-fold symmetry classes of non-Hermitian systems and corroborate the correspondence of the universality classes of Anderson transitions between non-Hermitian systems and Hermitized systems with additional chiral symmetry. We apply the nonlinear sigma model framework to study the spectral properties of non-Hermitian random matrices with particle-hole symmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Anderson transition unique to nonreciprocal disordered systems in one dimension, including the Hatano-Nelson model, originates from the competition between the kinetic and topological terms in a one-dimensional nonlinear sigma model. We also discuss the critical phenomena of non-Hermitian disordered systems with symmetry and topology in higher dimensions.

Title: Octahedral tilt-driven phase transitions in BaZrS$_3$ chalcogenide perovskite
Authors: Prakriti Kayastha, Erik Fransson, Paul Erhart, Lucy D. Whalley
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites are lead-free materials for potential photovoltaic or thermoelectric applications. BaZrS$_3$ is the most studied member of this family due to its superior thermal and chemical stability, desirable optoelectronic properties, and low thermal conductivity. Phase transitions of BaZrS$_3$ remain underexplored in the literature, as most experimental characterizations of this material have been performed at ambient conditions where the orthorhombic Pnma phase is reported to be stable. In this work, we study the dynamics of BaZrS$_3$ across a range of temperatures and pressures using an accurate machine-learning interatomic potential trained with data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. At 0 Pa, we find a first-order phase transition from the orthorhombic to tetragonal I4/mcm phase at 610 K, and a second-order transition from the tetragonal to the cubic Pm-3m phase at 880 K. The tetragonal phase is stable over a larger temperature range at higher pressures. To confirm the validity of our model we compare our results with a range of published experimental data and report a prediction for the X-ray diffraction pattern as a function of temperature.

Title: Spatial Correlation Unifies Nonequilibrium Response Theory for Arbitrary Markov Jump Processes
Authors: Jiming Zheng, Zhiyue Lu
Abstract: Understanding how systems respond to external perturbations is a fundamental challenge in physics, particularly for non-equilibrium and non-stationary processes. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem provides a complete framework for near-equilibrium systems, and various bounds are recently reported for specific non-equilibrium regimes. Here, we present an exact response equality for arbitrary Markov processes that decompose system response into spatial correlations of local dynamical events. This decomposition reveals that response properties are encoded in correlations between transitions and dwelling times across the network, providing a natural generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to generic non-equilibrium processes. Our theory unifies existing response bounds, extends them to time-dependent processes, and reveals fundamental monotonicity properties of the tightness of multi-parameter response inequalities. Beyond its theoretical significance, this framework enables efficient numerical evaluation of response properties from sampling unperturbed trajectory, offering significant advantages over traditional finite-difference approaches for estimating response properties of complex networks and biological systems far from equilibrium.

Title: Superdiffusive transport in chaotic quantum systems with nodal interactions
Authors: Yu-Peng Wang, Jie Ren, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Romain Vasseur
Abstract: We introduce a class of interacting fermionic quantum models in $d$ dimensions with nodal interactions that exhibit superdiffusive transport. We establish non-perturbatively that the nodal structure of the interactions gives rise to long-lived quasiparticle excitations that result in a diverging diffusion constant, even though the system is fully chaotic. Using a Boltzmann equation approach, we find that the charge mode acquires an anomalous dispersion relation at long wavelength $\omega(q) \sim q^{z} $ with dynamical exponent $z={\rm min}[(2n+d)/2n,2]$, where $n$ is the order of the nodal point in momentum space. We verify our predictions in one dimensional systems using tensor-network techniques.

Title: Edge states and persistent current in a PT-symmetric extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with generic boundary conditions
Authors: Supriyo Ghosh, Pijush K. Ghosh, Shreekantha Sil
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) model by including next-nearest neighbour(NNN) interaction and balanced loss-gain(BLG), and subjecting the whole system to an external uniform magnetic field. We study the band structure, edge states and persistent current in this extended SSH model under General Boundary Condition(GBC) of which the periodic, anti-periodic and open boundary conditions appear as special cases. It is shown that the point bandgap decreases with the increasing value of the strength of the NNN interaction and vanish beyond a critical value. Further, the line gap exhibits closed-loop like structures for non-vanishing NNN interaction under the Periodic Boundary Condition(PBC). The Zak phase receives no contribution from the NNN interaction under the PBC. We show that the NNN interaction has no effect on the persistent current in the half-filled limit for the case of PBC. We show that the model without the NNN interaction is exactly solvable for a class of GBC of which PBC, anti-periodic boundary condition(APBC) and anti-hermitian boundary condition(AHBC) arise as special cases. We obtain analytic expressions for the edge states in the case of Open Boundary Condition(OBC) and AHBC for vanishing NNN interaction. We show numerically for OBC that edge states in the topologically trivial phase appear for non-vanishing NNN interaction in the parametric regions where PT-symmetry is broken under PBC. In the topologically non-trivial phase, the edge states under OBC exists only up to a critical value of the NNN strength and vanishes beyond a critical value. The bulk-boundary correspondence(BBC) for unbroken PT-phase is similar to hermitian SSH model, while non-Hermitian skin effect(NHSE) is observed for broken PT-phase.

Title: Phase-space Generalized Brillouin Zone for spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Qingya Li, Hui Jiang, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: The generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) has been highly successful in characterizing the topology and band structure of non-Hermitian systems. However, its applicability has been challenged in spatially inhomogeneous settings, where the non-locality of non-Hermitian pumping competes with Wannier-Stark localization and quantum interference, potentially leading to highly non-exponential state accumulation. To transcend this major conceptual bottleneck, we develop a general phase-space GBZ formalism that encodes non-Bloch deformations in both position and momentum space, such as to accurately represent spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian pumping. A key new phenomenon is the bifurcation of the phase-space GBZ branches, which allows certain eigenstates to jump abruptly between different GBZ solutions at various points in real space. The freedom in the locations of such jumps opens up an emergent degree of freedom that protects the stability of real spectra and, more impressively, the robustness of a new class of topological zero modes unique to GBZ this http URL response from these novel spectral and GBZ singularities can be readily demonstrated in mature metamaterial platforms such as photonic crystals or circuit arrays, where effective real-space hoppings can be engineered in a versatile this http URL framework directly generalizes to more complicated unit cells and further hoppings, opening up a vast new arena for exploring unconventional spectral and topological transitions as well as GBZ fragmentation in spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian settings.

Title: Quantitative noncontact measurement of thermal Hall angle and transverse thermal conductivity by lock-in thermography
Authors: Takumi Imamura, Takamasa Hirai, Koichi Oyanagi, Ryo Iguchi, Kenta Takamori, Satoru Kobayashi, Ken-ichi Uchida
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a quantitative noncontact measurement method for the thermal Hall effect (THE) based on magnetic-field-modulated lock-in thermography. This method enables visualization of THE-induced temperature change and quantitative estimation of the thermal Hall angle $\theta_{\rm THE}$ by applying periodic magnetic fields to a sample and obtaining the first harmonic response of thermal images. By combining this method with LIT-based measurement techniques for the longitudinal thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$, we also quantify the transverse thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$. We validate our measurement methods by estimating $\theta_{\rm THE}$, $\kappa_{xx}$, and $\kappa_{xy}$ in a ferromagnetic Heusler alloy Co$_2$MnGa slab showing large THE.

Title: Anomalous nuclear spin coherence in superconducting Nb$_3$Sn

Abstract: We have investigated the normal and superconducting states of the technologically important compound Nb$_3$Sn using $^{93}$Nb nuclear magnetic resonance. From spin-lattice relaxation we find strong suppression of the zero-temperature superconducting order parameter by magnetic field. We have identified an anomalously large electron-nuclear exchange interaction from spin-spin relaxation measurements, an order of magnitude beyond that of the dipole-dipole interaction, and thereby sensitive to vortex dynamics and vortex pinning.

Title: Quantum Geometric Origin of Strain-Induced Ferroelectric Phase Transitions
Authors: Jiaming Hu, Ziye Zhu, Yubo Yuan, Wenbin Li, Hua Wang, Kai Chang
Abstract: Strain-regulated ferroelectric (FE) materials have long attracted significant attention due to their diverse applications. While soft-phonon theory and the (pseudo) Jahn-Teller effect have achieved considerable success in providing phenomenological descriptions and general understanding, the detailed connection between these perspectives and their microscopic dependence on strain regulation remains unclear. Here, under the framework of density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), we demonstrate that the Berry curvature of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) plays a pivotal role in the interatomic force matrix (IFM). A subsequent model analysis shows that external strain can reverse the polarity of the EPC Berry curvature in (quasi)-degenerate electronic subsystems through band inversion, thereby directly leading to phonon softening. The general theory is then applied to the BiOCl monolayer as a benchmark, which offers an accurate description of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This mechanism is further observed across a broad range of materials through ab initio calculations, providing an insightful perspective on EPC quantum geometry in lattice dynamics and FE phase transitions.

Title: Valley Gapless Semiconductor: Models and Applications
Authors: Kok Wai Lee, Pei-Hao Fu, Jun-Feng Liu, Ching Hua Lee, Yee Sin Ang
Abstract: The emerging field of valleytronics harnesses the valley degree of freedom of electrons, akin to how electronic and spintronic devices utilize the charge and spin degrees of freedom of electrons respectively. The engineering of valleytronic devices typically relies on the coupling between valley and other degrees of freedom such as spin, giving rise to valley-spintronics where an external magnetic field manipulates the information stored in valleys. Here, the valley gapless semiconductor is proposed as a potential electrically controlled valleytronic platform because the valley degree of freedom is coupled to the carrier type, i.e., electrons and holes. The valley degree of freedom can be electrically controlled by tuning the carrier type via the device gate voltage. We demonstrate the proposal for realizing a valley gapless semiconductor in the honeycomb lattice with the Haldane and modified Haldane models. The system's valley-carrier coupling is further studied for its transport properties in an all-electrically controlled valley filter device setting. Our work highlights the significance of the valley gapless semiconductor for valleytronic devices.

Title: Topological Josephson vortices at finite voltage bias
Authors: Kiryl Piasotski, Adrian Reich, Alexander Shnirman
Abstract: We study the effects of finite voltage bias on Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states in topological Josephson junctions with a vortex lattice. The voltage drives vortices into steady motion, squeezing the CdGM spectrum due to quasi-relativistic dispersion. A finite voltage range allows well-defined states, but beyond a critical breakdown voltage, the states collapse to zero energy and become sharply localized, marking a dynamical transition. Additionally, finite bias modifies selection rules for CdGM state transitions. Notably, in the steady-state regime, the time-averaged current vanishes, revealing a novel interplay between vortex dynamics and quantum coherence.

Title: Fluctuation Dissipation Relations for the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model
Authors: Martin Kjøllesdal Johnsrud, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, arXiv:2409.14977]. Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.

Title: Pisarenko's Formula for the Thermopower
Authors: Andrei Novitskii, Takao Mori
Abstract: The thermopower $\alpha$ (also known as the Seebeck coefficient) is one of the most fundamental material characteristics for understanding charge carrier transport in thermoelectric materials. Here, we revisit the Pisarenko formula for the thermopower, which was traditionally considered valid only for non-degenerate semiconductors. We demonstrate that regardless of the dominating scattering mechanism, the Pisarenko formula describes accurately enough the relationship between thermopower $\alpha$ and charge carrier concentration $n$ beyond the non-degenerate limit. Moreover, the Pisarenko formula provides a simple thermopower-conductivity relation, $\alpha = \pm \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}}}{e} (b - \ln \sigma)$, valid for materials with $\alpha > 90$ $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ when acoustic phonon scattering is predominant. This offers an alternative way to analyze electron transport when Hall measurements are difficult or inaccessible. Additionally, we show how the Pisarenko formula can be used to estimate the maximum power factor of a thermoelectric material from the weighted mobility of a single, not necessarily optimized, sample at any given temperature.

Title: Boosting superconductivity: how nanofaceted surfaces transform the ground state of ultrathin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films
Authors: Eric Wahlberg, Riccardo Arpaia, Debmalya Chakraborty, Alexei Kalaboukhov, David Vignolles, Cyril Proust, Annica M. Black-Schaffer, Götz Seibold, Thilo Bauch, Floriana Lombardi
Abstract: In the cuprate high-temperature superconductors doping is fixed during synthesis and the charge carrier density per CuO$_2$ plane cannot be easily tuned by conventional gating, unlike 2D materials. Strain engineering has recently emerged as a powerful tuning knob for manipulating the properties of cuprates, in particular charge and spin orders, and their delicate interplay with superconductivity. In thin films, additional tunability can be introduced by the substrate surface morphology, particularly nanofacets formed by substrate surface reconstruction. Here we show a remarkable enhancement of the superconducting onset temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{on}}$ and the upper critical magnetic field $H_{c,2}$ in nanometer-thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films grown on a substrate with a nanofaceted surface. We theoretically show that the enhancement is driven by electronic nematicity and unidirectional charge density waves, where both elements are captured by an additional effective potential at the interface between the film and the uniquely textured substrate. Our findings show a new paradigm in which substrate engineering can effectively enhance the superconducting properties of cuprates. This approach opens an exciting frontier in the design and optimization of high-performance superconducting materials.

Title: Quantifying Ionic Liquid Affinity and Its Effect on Phospholipid Membrane Structure and Dynamics
Authors: V. K. Sharma, J. Gupta, H. Srinivasan, P. Hitaishi, S. K. Ghosh, S. Mitra
Abstract: In this study, we examine the impact of imidazolium based ILs on the viscoelasticity, dynamics, and phase behavior of two model membrane systems, (i) lipid monolayers and (ii) unilamellar vesicles composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Our findings demonstrate that both ILs induce significant disorder in lipid membranes by altering the area per lipid molecule, thereby modulating their viscoelastic properties. ILs with longer alkyl chains show stronger interactions with membranes, causing more pronounced disorder. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates that IL incorporation shifts the membrane main phase transition to lower temperatures and introduces gauche defects, signifying increased structural disorder. This effect is amplified with longer alkyl chains and higher IL concentrations. Quasielastic neutron scattering studies highlight that ILs markedly enhance the lateral diffusion of lipids within the membrane leaflet, with the extent of enhancement determined by the membrane physical state, IL concentration, and alkyl chain length. The most pronounced acceleration in lateral diffusion occurs in ordered membrane phase with higher concentrations of the longer chain IL. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate these experimental findings, showing that longer chain ILs extensively disrupt lipid organization, introduce more gauche defects, increase the area per lipid, and consequently enhance lateral diffusion. This increase in lipid fluidity and permeability provides a mechanistic basis for the observed higher toxicity associated with longer chain ILs.

Title: Photonic heat amplifiers based on Anderson insulators
Authors: Matteo Pioldi, Giorgio De Simoni, Alessandro Braggio, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: A photonic heat amplifier (PHA) designed for cryogenic operations is introduced and analyzed. This device comprises two Anderson insulator reservoirs connected by lossless lines, allowing them to exchange heat through photonic modes. This configuration enables negative differential thermal conductance (NDTC), which can be harnessed to amplify thermal signals. To achieve this, we maintain one reservoir at a high temperature, serving as the source terminal of a thermal transistor. Concurrently, in the other one, we establish tunnel contacts to metallic reservoirs, which function as the gate and drain terminals. With this arrangement, it is possible to control the heat flux exchange between the source and drain by adjusting the gate temperature. We present two distinct parameter choices that yield different performances: the first emphasizes modulating the source-drain heat current, while the second focuses on the temperature modulation of the colder Anderson insulator. Lastly, we present a potential design variation in which all electronic reservoirs are thermally connected through only photonic modes, allowing interactions between distant elements. The proposal of the PHA addresses the lack of thermal transistors and amplifiers in the mK range while being compatible with the rich toolbox of circuit quantum electrodynamics. It can be adapted to various applications, including sensing and developing thermal circuits and control devices at sub-Kelvin temperatures, which are relevant to quantum technologies.

Title: Continuous time crystals as a PT symmetric state and the emergence of critical exceptional points
Authors: Yuma Nakanishi, Ryo Hanai, Tomohiro Sasamoto
Abstract: Continuous time-translation symmetry is often spontaneously broken in open quantum systems, and the condition for their emergence has been actively investigated. However, there are only a few cases in which its condition for appearance has been fully elucidated. In this Letter, we show that a Lindbladian parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry can generically produce persistent periodic oscillations in a wide class of systems. This includes one-collective spin models, which have been studied thoroughly in the context of dissipative continuous time crystals, and spatially extended bipartite bosonic systems with conserved particle number. Interestingly, the periodic orbits in the PT-symmetric phase are found to be center-type, implying an initial state dependence. These results are established by proving that the Lindbladian $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry at the microscopic level implies a nonlinear PT symmetry, and by performing a linear stability analysis near the transition point. This research will further our understanding of novel non-equilibrium phases of matter and phase transitions with spontaneous anti-unitary symmetry breaking.

Title: Magic spreading in random quantum circuits
Authors: Xhek Turkeshi, Emanuele Tirrito, Piotr Sierant
Abstract: Magic is the resource that quantifies the amount of beyond-Clifford operations necessary for universal quantum computing. It bounds the cost of classically simulating quantum systems via stabilizer circuits central to quantum error correction and computation. How rapidly do generic many-body dynamics generate magic resources under the constraints of locality and unitarity? We address this central question by exploring magic spreading in brick-wall random unitary circuits. We explore scalable magic measures intimately connected to the algebraic structure of the Clifford group. These metrics enable the investigation of the spreading of magic for system sizes of up to $N=1024$ qudits, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art, which was restricted to about a dozen qudits. We demonstrate that magic resources equilibrate on timescales logarithmic in the system size, akin to anti-concentration and Hilbert space delocalization phenomena, but qualitatively different from the spreading of entanglement entropy. As random circuits are minimal models for chaotic dynamics, we conjecture that our findings describe the phenomenology of magic resources growth in a broad class of chaotic many-body systems.

Title: Twisted Bilayer Graphene in Commensurate Angles
Authors: Tal Malinovitch
Abstract: The recent discovery of ``magic angles" in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has spurred extensive research into its electronic properties. The primary tool for studying this thus far has been the famous Bistritzer-MacDonald model (BM model), which relies on several approximations. This work aims to build the first steps in studying magic angles without using this model. Thus, we study a 2d model for TBG in both AA and AB stacking \emph{without} the approximations of the BM model in the continuum setting, using two copies of a potential with the symmetries of graphene, either sharing a common origin (in AA stacking) or with shifted origins (in AB stacking), and twisted with respect to each other. Our results hold for a wide class of potentials in both stacking types. We describe the angles for which the two twisted lattices are commensurate and prove the existence of Dirac cones in the vertices of the Brillouin zone for such angles. Furthermore, we show that for small potentials, the slope of the Dirac cones is small for commensurate angles that are close to incommensurate angles. This work is the first to establish the existence of Dirac cones for twisted bilayer graphene (for either stacking) in the continuum setting without relying on the BM model. This work is the first in a series of works to build a more fundamental understanding of the phenomenon of magic angles.

Title: The Interplay of Heterogeneity and Product Detachment in Templated Polymer Copying
Authors: Jeremy E. B. Guntoro, Benjamin J. Qureshi, Thomas E. Ouldridge
Abstract: Templated copolymerization, in which information stored in the sequence of a heteropolymer template is copied into another polymer product, is the mechanism behind all known methods of genetic information transfer. A key aspect of templated copolymerization is the eventual detachment of the product from the template. A second key feature of natural biochemical systems is that the template-binding free energies of both correctly-matched and incorrect monomers are heterogeneous. Previous work has considered the thermodynamic consequences of detachment, and the consequences of heterogeniety for polymerisation speed and accuracy, but the interplay of both separation and heterogeniety remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate a minimal model of templated copying that simultaneously incorporates both detachment from behind the leading edge of the growing copy and heterogeneous interactions. We first extend existing coarse-graining methods for models of polymerisation to allow for heterogeneous interactions. We then show that heterogeneous copying systems with explicit detachment do not exhibit the subdiffusive behaviour observed in the absence of detachment when near equilibrium. Next, we show that heterogeneity in correct monomer interactions tends to result in slower, less accurate copying, while heterogeneity in incorrect monomer interactions tends to result in faster, more accurate copying, due to an increased roughness in the free energy landscape of either correct or incorrect monomer pairs. Finally, we show that heterogeneity can improve on known thermodynamic efficiencies of homogeneous copying, but these increased thermodynamic efficiencies do not always translate to increased efficiencies of information transfer.

Abstract: We present the first results from the Quantum Resolution-Optimized Cryogenic Observatory for Dark matter Incident at Low Energy (QROCODILE). The QROCODILE experiment uses a microwire-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) as a target and sensor for dark matter scattering and absorption, and is sensitive to energy deposits as low as 0.11 eV. We introduce the experimental configuration and report new world-leading constraints on the interactions of sub-MeV dark matter particles with masses as low as 30 keV. The thin-layer geometry of the system provides anisotropy in the interaction rate, enabling directional sensitivity. In addition, we leverage the coupling between phonons and quasiparticles in the detector to simultaneously constrain interactions with both electrons and nucleons. We discuss the potential for improvements to both the energy threshold and effective volume of the experiment in the coming years.

Title: Orthogonal projections of hypercubes
Authors: Yoshiaki Horiike, Shin Fujishiro
Abstract: Projections of hypercubes are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional binary state spaces across various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate the exploration of theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA for projecting hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, thus characterizing the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. Our work contributes to a better understanding of how PCA can be applied to explore high-dimensional binary data.

Title: Singlet-only Always-on Gapless Exchange Qubits with Baseband Control
Authors: Nathan L. Foulk, Silas Hoffman, Katharina Laubscher, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: We propose a singlet-only always-on gapless exchange (SAGE) spin qubit that encodes a single qubit in the spins of four electrons while allowing universal baseband control. While conventional exchange-only qubits suffer from magnetic-field-gradient-induced leakage and coherent errors, for instance due to local nuclear environments and variations in the $g$-factor, the SAGE qubit subspace is protected from coherent errors due to local magnetic field gradients and leakage out of the computational subspace is energetically suppressed due to the exchange interactions between electrons being always-on. Consequently, we find that when magnetic gradient noise dominates over charge noise, coherence times and single-qubit gate infidelities of the SAGE qubit improve by an order of magnitude compared to conventional exchange-only qubits. Moreover, using realistic parameters, two-qubit gates can be performed with a single interqubit exchange pulse with times comparable in duration to conventional exchange-only qubits but with a significantly simplified pulse sequence.

Title: Terahertz Defect Detection in Multi-Layer Materials Using Echo Labeling
Authors: Dogus Can Sevdiren, Furkan H. Ilgac, Aydin Sezgin
Abstract: Non-destructive testing is an important technique for detecting defects in multi-layer materials, enabling the evaluation of structural integrity without causing damage on test materials. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) offers unique capabilities for this purpose due to its sensitivity and resolution. Inspired by room geometry estimation methods in acoustic signal processing, this work proposes a novel approach for defect detection in multi-layer composite materials using THz-TDS, enhanced by high-power sources. The proposed method utilizes Euclidean distance matrices to reduce problem complexity compared to state-of-the-art approaches, and effectively distinguishes and maps higher-order reflections from sublayers, enabling precise defect localization in composite materials without artifacts.
