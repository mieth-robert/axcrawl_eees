Title: Gross-Neveu-XY quantum criticality in moiré Dirac materials
Authors: Bilal Hawashin, Michael M. Scherer, Lukas Janssen
Abstract: Two-dimensional van-der-Waals materials offer a highly tunable platform for engineering electronic band structures and interactions. By employing techniques such as twisting, gating, or applying pressure, these systems enable precise control over the electronic excitation spectrum. In moiré bilayer graphene, the tunability facilitates the transition from a symmetric Dirac semimetal phase through a quantum critical point into an interaction-induced long-range ordered phase with a finite band gap. At charge neutrality, the ordered state proposed to emerge from twist-angle tuning is the Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator. In this case, the transition falls into the quantum universality class of the relativistic Gross-Neveu-XY model in 2+1 dimensions. Here, we refine estimates for the critical exponents characterizing this universality class using an expansion around the lower critical space-time dimension of two. We compute the order-parameter anomalous dimension $\eta_\varphi$ and the correlation-length exponent $\nu$ at one-loop order, and the fermion anomalous dimension $\eta_\psi$ at two-loop order. Combining these results with previous findings from the expansion around the upper critical dimension, we obtain improved estimates for the universal exponents in $2+1$ dimensions via Padé interpolation. For $N_\mathrm{f} = 4$ four-component Dirac fermions, relevant to moiré bilayer graphene, we estimate $1/\nu=0.916(5)$, $\eta_\varphi=0.926(13)$, and $\eta_\psi=0.0404(13)$. For $N_\mathrm{f} = 2$, potentially relevant to recent tetralayer WSe$_2$ experiments, the Gross-Neveu-XY fixed point may be unstable due to a fixed-point collision at $N_\mathrm{f,c}$, with $N_\mathrm{f,c} = 1 + \sqrt{2} + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ in the expansion around the lower critical dimension.

Title: Emulation of quantum correlations by classical dynamics in a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain
Authors: Chaebin Kim, Martin Mourigal
Abstract: We simulate the dynamical spin structure factor (DSSF) S(q,w) of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain using classical simulations. By employing Landau-Lifshitz Dynamics, we emulate quantum correlations through temperature-dependent corrections, including rescaling of magnetic dipoles and renormalization of exchange interactions. Our results demonstrate that the quantum-equivalent DSSF closely matches Quantum Monte-Carlo calculations for kBT/J ~ 1, capturing the continuum of magnetic excitations observed in neutron scattering measurements. At higher temperatures, our simulations comply with general predictions by De Gennes, where the pinched-oval spectral continuum reflects the uncorrelated paramagnetic fluctuations in the infinite temperature limit. Surprisingly, entanglement witnesses extracted from the quantum-equivalent DSSF mimic quantum calculations across all temperatures, despite relying on classical dynamics. However, classical simulations fail to reproduce higher energy spectral weight from spinon excitations at lower temperatures and struggle to explain the system behavior at intermediate temperatures and magnetic fields. Our approach highlights the potential of classical dynamics to emulate quantum effects even in the most extreme spin systems, with implications for future experimental and theoretical investigations.

Title: Scaling laws for passive polymer dynamics in active turbulence
Authors: Zahra K. Valei, Tyler N. Shendruk
Abstract: Biological systems commonly combine intrinsically out-of-equilibrium active components with passive polymeric inclusions to produce unique material properties. To explore these composite systems, idealized models - such as polymers in active fluids - are essential to develop a predictive theoretical framework. We simulate a single, freely jointed passive chain in two-dimensional active turbulence. Active flows advect the polymer, producing a substantially enhanced diffusivity. Our results reveal that the dimensionless diffusivity obeys scaling laws governed by the Péclet, Weissenberg, and Ericksen numbers, which paves the way for designing active/polymeric hybrid materials with predictable properties that differ significantly from those of nondeformable inclusions.

Title: Multiferroic nematic d-wave altermagnetism driven by orbital-order on the honeycomb lattice
Authors: Luigi Camerano, Adolfo O. Fumega, Jose L. Lado, Alessandro Stroppa, Gianni Profeta
Abstract: Altermagnets provide promising platforms for unconventional magnetism, whose controllability would enable a whole new generation of spintronic devices. While a variety of bulk altermagnets have been discovered, altermagnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals materials has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that the strained honeycomb monolayer VCl$_{3}$ is an orbital-order-driven ferroelectric altermagnet, exhibiting a significant and switchable spin-splitting. By using low-energy Hamiltonian and first-principles methods in combination with symmetry analysis, we reveal a unique anti-ferro-orbital-antiferromagnetic phase characterized by a 2D nematic $d$-wave altermagnetic spin splitting, tightly coupled with an orbital-ordered induced ferroelectric polarization. Finally, through symmetry mode analysis, we investigate how structural distortions favor the intricate interplay between orbital, altermagnetic, and ferroelectric degrees of freedom. Our study identifies VCl$_3$ as a prototypical 2D orbital-order-driven multiferroic altermagnet on the honeycomb lattice, establishing a van der Waals monolayer featuring altermagnetic ferroelectricity.

Title: Developing a Complete AI-Accelerated Workflow for Superconductor Discovery
Authors: Jason B. Gibson, Ajinkya C. Hire, Philip M. Dee, Benjamin Geisler, Jung Soo Kim, Zhongwei Li, James J. Hamlin, Gregory R. Stewart, P. J. Hirschfeld, Richard G. Hennig
Abstract: The evolution of materials discovery has continually transformed, progressing from empirical experimentation to virtual high-throughput screening, which leverages computational techniques to fully characterize a material before synthesis. Despite the successes of these approaches, significant bottlenecks remain due to the high computational cost of density functional theory (DFT) calculations required to determine the thermodynamic and dynamic stability of a material and its functional properties. In particular, discovering new superconductors is massively impeded by the cost of computing the electron-phonon spectral functions, which limits the feasible materials space. Recent advances in machine learning offer an opportunity to accelerate the superconductor discovery workflow by developing machine-learning-based surrogates for DFT. Here we present a Bootstrapped Ensemble of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (BEE-NET), a ML model that predicts the Eliashberg spectral function achieves a test mean absolute error of 0.87 K for the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), relative to predictions of the Allen-Dynes equation using DFT-derived spectral functions. BEE-NET simultaneously identifies candidate structures with $T_c > 5$ K at a precision of 86% and a true negative rate of 99.4%. Combined with elemental substitution and ML interatomic potentials, this models puts us in position to develop a complete AI-accelerated workflow to identify novel superconductors. The workflow achieved 87% precision, narrowing 1.3 million candidates to 741 stable compounds with DFT-confirmed $T_c > 5$ K. We report the prediction and successful experimental synthesis, characterization, and verification of two novel superconductors. This work exemplifies the potential of integrating machine learning, computational methods, and experimental techniques to revolutionize the field of materials discovery.

Title: Pressure tuning of Kitaev spin liquid candidate Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$
Authors: E. H. T. Poldi, R. Tartaglia, G. Fabbris, N. Nguyen, H. Park, Z. Liu, M. van Veenendaal, R. Kumar, G. Jose, S. Samanta, W. Bi, Y. Xiao, D. Popov, Y. Wu, J.-W. Kim, H. Zheng, J. Yan, J. F. Mitchell, R. J. Hemley, D. Haskel
Abstract: The search for Kitaev's quantum spin liquid (KQSL) state in real materials has recently expanded with the prediction that honeycomb lattices of divalent, high-spin cobalt ions could host the dominant bond-dependent exchange interactions required to stabilize the elusive entangled quantum state. The layered honeycomb Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ has been singled out as a leading candidate provided that the trigonal crystal field acting on Co $3d$ orbitals, which enhances non-Kitaev exchange interactions between $J_{\rm eff}=\frac{1}{2}$ spin-orbital pseudospins, is reduced. We find that applied pressure leads to anisotropic compression of the layered structure, significantly reducing the trigonal distortion of CoO$_6$ octahedra. A strong enhancement of ferromagnetic correlations between pseudospins is observed in the spin-polarized (3 Tesla) phase up to about 60 GPa. Higher pressures drive a spin transition into a low-spin state destroying the $J_{\rm eff}=\frac{1}{2}$ local moments required to map the spin Hamiltonian into Kitaev's model. The spin transition strongly suppresses the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility and appears to stabilize a paramagnetic phase driven by frustration. Although applied pressure fails to realize a KQSL state, the possible emergence of frustrated magnetism of localized, low-spin $S=\frac{1}{2}$ moments opens the door for exploration of novel magnetic quantum states in compressed honeycomb lattices of divalent cobaltates.

Title: $π$/4 phase shift in the angular magnetoresistance of infinite layer nickelates
Authors: Yoav Mairovich, Ariel Matzliach, Idan S. Wallerstein, Himadri R. Dakua, Eran Maniv, Eytan Grosfeld, Muntaser Naamneh
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in nickelates has generated significant interest in condensed matter physics. Nickelate superconductors, which are hole-doped within the layered structure of RNiO$_2$, share structural similarities with high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors. However, despite similarities in formal valence and crystal symmetry, the fundamental nature of the superconducting state and the parent compound phase in nickelates remains elusive. Strong electronic correlations in infinite-layer nickelates suggest a potentially complex phase diagram, akin to that observed in cuprates, yet a key question about the magnetic ground state remains unanswered. Through magnetoresistance measurements across varying field strengths and orientations, we observe distinct angular-dependent magnetoresistance (AMR) oscillations with four-fold symmetry. Notably, this four-fold symmetry displays a $\pi/4$ phase shift with doping or applied magnetic field. Our findings parallel behaviors in electron-doped cuprates, suggesting that a static or quasi-static magnetic order exists in the infinite-layer nickelates, echoing characteristics of electron-doped cuprates. Furthermore, our modeling of the system reveals that the AMR is directly related to the underlying antiferromagnetic order, reinforcing this interpretation.

Title: Quasi-Brittle Fracture: The Blended Approach
Authors: Semsi Coskun, Davood Damircheli, Robert Lipton
Abstract: A field theory is presented for predicting damage and fracture in quasi-brittle materials. The approach taken here is new and blends a non-local constitutive law with a two-point phase field. In this formulation, the material displacement field is uniquely determined by the initial boundary value problem. The theory naturally satisfies energy balance, with positive energy dissipation rate in accord with the Clausius-Duhem inequality. Notably, these properties are not imposed but follow directly from the constitutive law and evolution equation when multiplying the equation of motion by the velocity and integrating by parts. In addition to elastic constants, the model requires at most three key material parameters: the strain at the onset of nonlinearity, the ultimate tensile strength, and the fracture toughness. The approach simplifies parameter identification while ensuring representation of material behavior. The approach seamlessly handles fracture evolution across loading regimes, from quasi-static to dynamic, accommodating both fast crack propagation and quasi-brittle failure under monotonic and cyclic loading. Numerical simulations show quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiments, including three-point bending tests on concrete. The model successfully captures the cyclic load-deflection response of crack mouth opening displacement, the structural size-effect related to ultimate load and specimen size, fracture originating from corner singularities in L- shaped domains, and bifurcating fast cracks.

Title: Deconfined Gapless phases and criticalities in Shastry-Sutherland Antiferromagnet
Authors: Lvcheng Chen, Zheng-Xin Liu
Abstract: Antiferromagnets on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice has attracted lots of research interest due to the possible existence of deconfined criticality. In the present work, we study the $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$ model using Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method, where $J_1$, $J_2$, $J_4$ stand for the nearest-neighbor, next nearest neighbor and ring exchange interactions respectively. An empty plaquette (EP) phase is found with spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking. However, different from the EP phase in literature, the EP phase in our VMC approach is a $Z_2$ deconfined phase with majorana-type gapless spinons in the excitation spectrum. Additionally, a symmetric gapless $Z_2$ Quantum spin liquid phase is found adjacent to the EP phase, full plaquette (FP) and the Neel antiferromagnetic phases. The phase transition from the QSL phase to these ordered phases are found to be continuous. While the transition to the EP phase is of Landau type, the transitions to the Neel phase and the FP phase can be interpreted as condensation of $Z_2$ gauge charge ($e$ particle) and flux ($m$ particle).

Authors: Yasuharu Okamoto
Abstract: This paper introduces a technique to enhance the efficiency of quadratic machine learning models, particularly Field-Aware Factorization Machines (FFMs) handling binary data. Our approach strategically reduces model size through optimized feature selection based on the Ising model, maintaining comparable accuracy to the original model. By exploiting the adjustability of FFM's cross-term weights during a novel two-stage training process, we demonstrate a significant improvement in overall computational efficiency.

Title: Active magneto gyrator as a tunable heat engine or heat pump
Authors: F. Adersh, M. Muhsin, M. Sahoo
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermodynamic performance characteristics of an active magneto-gyrator taking into account the two-dimensional motion of an inertial charged active particle confined in an asymmetric parabolic potential and in contact with two heat baths kept at two different temperatures. A magnetic field of constant magnitude is applied in a direction perpendicular to the plane of motion. In such a system, the particle exhibits a gyrating motion across the potential minimum and exerts a torque on the confining potential as long as there is a potential asymmetry and temperature gradient. Hence, this system can operate as an active magneto-heat engine or pump in the presence of a load force. Interestingly, we observe that the activity or self-propulsion impacts the thermodynamic performance characteristics of the gyrator only in the presence of the magnetic field. We examine two scenarios: first, by applying a load in a direction opposing the torque and second, by applying a load in the same direction as that of torque. In the first case, for a fixed parameter regime, the gyrator is found to act as a heat engine or a heat pump depending on the strength of the applied load, whereas in the latter case, it can only operate as a heat pump. Moreover, unlike the Brownian gyrator or Brownian magneto gyrator, captivatingly, the efficiency is found to have no universal upper bound and can be made $100\%$ by tuning the system parameters. Additionally, when the system is suspended in a viscoelastic medium characterized by the presence of a finite memory, for a short persistence of memory and a fixed duration of activity, the efficiency can be $100\%$ even for more than one value of viscoelastic memory timescale.

Title: Large asymmetric anomalous Nernst effect in the antiferromagnet SrIr$_{0.8}$Sn$_{0.2}$O$_3$
Authors: Dongliang Gong, Junyi Yang, Shu Zhang, Shashi Pandey, Dapeng Cui, Jacob P. C. Ruff, Lukas Horak, Evguenia Karapetrova, Jong-Woo Kim, Philip J. Ryan, Lin Hao, Yang Zhang, Jian Liu
Abstract: A large anomalous Nernst effect is essential for thermoelectric energy harvesting in the transverse geometry without external magnetic field. It is often connected with anomalous Hall effect, especially when electronic Berry curvature is believed to be the driving force. This approach implicitly assumes the same symmetry for the Nernst and Hall coefficients, which is however not necessarily true. Here we report a large anomalous Nernst effect in antiferromagnetic SrIr$_{0.8}$Sn$_{0.2}$O$_3$ that defies the antisymmetric constraint on the anomalous Hall effect imposed by the Onsager reciprocal relation. The observed spontaneous Nernst thermopower quickly reaches the sub-$\mu$V/K level below the Néel transition around 250 K, which is comparable with many topological antiferromagnetic semimetals and far excels other magnetic oxides. Our analysis indicates that the coexistence of significant symmetric and antisymmetric contributions plays a key role, pointing to the importance of extracting both contributions and a new pathway to enhanced anomalous Nernst effect for transverse thermoelectrics

Title: Acceleration of shell DFT-1/2 in high-throughput calculations via cutoff radii prediction
Authors: Shanzhong Xie, Kan-Hao Xue, Zijian Zhou, Xiangshui Miao
Abstract: Shell DFT-1/2 is a fast band gap rectification method that is versatile for semiconductor supercell and superlattice calculations, which involves two cutoff radii that have to be optimized. Although such optimization is trivial in terms of time cost for a primitive cell, in high-throughput calculations this can be a big concern because most materials are themselves in small unit cells. The numerous optimization trials increase the computational cost to orders of magnitudes higher. In this work, we construct a regression model for the prediction of the two cutoff radii based on chemical composition and primitive cell structure. Moreover, a model for metal and insulator classification is also given, with 95.2% accuracy.

Title: Tuning the Delicate Topology of Topological Phases
Authors: Snigdh Sabharwal
Abstract: We present a unified framework to systematically embed complex knotted and linked structures, beyond the torus family, into diverse topological phases, including Hopf insulators, classical spin liquids, topological semimetals, and non-Hermitian metals. Using rational maps and level sets of complex polynomials, we explicitly construct new topological models exhibiting rich and previously inaccessible textures. These topological features manifest distinctly across physical systems: emergent magnetic field lines in Hopf insulators directly reflect the rational-map topology, paralleling topological electromagnetism, while in classical spin liquids the topology is experimentally accessible via the equal-time structure factor. Our approach thus provides both a conceptual unification of previously disconnected systems and a practical toolset for realizing and detecting intricate topological textures in experiments.

Title: Piezoelectric Transition in a Nonpyroelectric Gyroidal Metal-Organic Framework
Authors: Shunsuke Kitou, Hajime Ishikawa, Yusuke Tokunaga, Masato Ueno, Hiroshi Sawa, Yuiga Nakamura, Yuto Kinoshita, Tatsuya Miyamoto, Hiroshi Okamoto, Koichi Kindo, Taka-hisa Arima
Abstract: Among the thirty-two crystallographic point groups, 432 is the only one that lacks an inversion center but does not exhibit piezoelectricity. A gyroidal structure belongs to point group 432 and shows characteristic physical properties attributed to its distinctive strong isotropic network. Here, we investigate a gyroidal cobalt oxalate metal-organic framework (MOF) with disordered orientations of SO4 tetrahedra. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments using a single crystal reveal a cubic-to-cubic structural phase transition at TS = 120 K. This transition involves a change in the point group from nonpiezoelectric 432 to piezoelectric 23. The symmetry change arises from the ordering of distorted SO4 molecules, leading to a three-dimensional helical arrangement of electric dipole moments. Furthermore, pyroelectric current measurements using polycrystalline pellet samples reveal that electric polarization emerges below TS depending on the magnitude of the pelletizing pressure, demonstrating piezoelectricity. The gyroidal MOF offers an opportunity to explore unique dielectric properties induced by the helical ordering of molecules and structural flexibility.

Title: Intrinsic phase fluctuation and superfluid density in doped Mott insulators
Authors: Zeyu Han, Zhi-Jian Song, Jia-Xin Zhang, Zheng-Yu Weng
Abstract: The doping dependence of the superfluid density $\rho_{\text{s}}$ exhibits distinct behaviors in the underdoping and overdoping regimes of the cuprate, while the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_c$ is generally scaled with $\rho_{\text{s}}$. In this paper, we present a unified understanding of the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and $\rho_{\text{s}}$ across the entire doping range by incorporating the underlying mutual Chern-Simons gauge structure that couples the spin and charge degrees of freedom in the doped Mott insulator. Within this framework, the SC phase fluctuations are deeply intertwined with the spin dynamics, such that thermally excited neutral spins determine $T_c$, while quantum spin excitations effectively reduce the superfluid density at zero temperature. As a result, a Uemura-like scaling of $T_c$ vs. $\rho_{\text{s}}$ in the underdoped regime naturally emerges, while the suppression of both $T_c$ and $\rho_{\text{s}}$ at overdoping is attributed to a drastic reduction of antiferromagnetic spin correlations.

Title: Two-mode Floquet quantum master approach for quantum transport through mesoscopic systems: Engineering of the fractional quantization
Authors: Vahid Mosallanejad, Wenjie Dou
Abstract: Simultaneous driving by two periodic oscillations yields a practical technique for further engineering quantum systems. For quantum transport through mesoscopic systems driven by two strong periodic terms, a non-perturbative Floquet-based quantum master equation (QME) approach is developed using a set of dissipative time-dependent terms and the reduced density matrix of the system. This work extends our previous Floquet approach for transport through quantum dots (at finite temperature and arbitrary bias) driven periodically by a single frequency. In a pedagogical way, we derive explicit time-dependent dissipative terms. Our theory begins with the derivation of the two-mode Floquet Liouville-von Neumann equation. We then explain the second-order Wangsness-Bloch-Redfield QME with a slightly modified definition of the interaction picture. Subsequently, the two-mode Shirley time evolution formula is applied, allowing for the integration of reservoir dynamics. Consequently, the established formalism has a wide range of applications in open quantum systems driven by two modes in the weak coupling regime. The formalism's potential applications are demonstrated through various examples.

Title: Underwater Willis lens for broadband low-frequency focusing
Authors: Beomseok Oh, Dongwoo Lee, Yeon-Seong Choo, Sung-Hoon Byun, Jehyeon Shin, Sea-Moon Kim, Junsuk Rho
Abstract: Broadband underwater sound focusing in the low-frequency range is essential for various applications such as battery-free environmental monitoring and sensing. However, achieving low-frequency underwater focusing typically necessitates bulky, heavy structures that hinder practical deployment. Here, we introduce a three-dimensional underwater lens comprising cavity-based locally resonant asymmetric structures, enabling the efficient manipulation of low-frequency waterborne sound through a densely packed lattice configuration. We experimentally validated its broadband focusing performance over a range of 20-35 kHz. In addition, we observed that our lens exhibits asymmetric backscattering-a distinctive effect arising from its bianisotropic nature-which we term the Willis lens. Unlike conventional underwater lenses that rely on fully filled structures, our design employs cavity-based scatterers, achieving a lighter yet robust focusing performance. With its lightweight, efficient, and reliable design, the Willis lens provides a promising platform for underwater sensor networks and future advancements in on-demand waterborne sound focusing.

Title: Nonreciprocal spin-charge interconversion in topological insulator/ferromagnet heterostructures
Authors: Shuyuan Shi, Enlong Liu, Fanrui Hu, Guoyi Shi, Aurelien Manchon, Hyunsoo Yang
Abstract: The process of spin-charge interconversion is critical in modern spintronics. Nonetheless, experiments conducted on a wide variety of magnetic heterostructures consistently report that charge-to-spin and spin-to-charge conversion efficiencies can be vastly different, especially in the case of topological insulators (TI). This discrepancy between the two "reciprocal" effects remains unexplained, hampering the development of spin devices based on spin-charge conversion. In this study, we investigate both spin-charge and charge-spin interconversion processes in TI Bi2Te3/Py and Pt/Py bilayers experimentally using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and spin pumping techniques. We find that the measured charge-to-spin conversion efficiency (C-S) in TI/Py is ~26 times larger than the measured spin-to-charge conversion efficiency (S-C), whereas C-S and S-C are comparable in the case of Pt/Py. Using a theoretical model enforcing Onsager reciprocity, we show that spin-to-charge and charge-to-spin conversions in bilayers are genuinely inequivalent, and explain our results as arising from the distinct spin current leakage that takes place during the interconversion. This work clarifies previous conflicting reports on spin-charge interconversion processes and highlights the potential of interface engineering to achieve efficient spin transport in TI-based ferromagnetic heterostructures, paving the way for highly efficient spintronic devices.

Title: Structural and transport properties of LiTFSI/G3 electrolyte with machine-learned molecular dynamics
Authors: Chenyang Cao, Liyi Bai, Shuo Cao, Ye Su, Yanzhou Wang, Zheyong Fan, Ping Qian
Abstract: The lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)azanide-triglyme electrolyte plays a critical role in the performance of lithium-ion batteries. However, its solvation structure and transport properties at the atomic scale remain incompletely understood. In this study, we develop an efficient and accurate neuroevolution potential (NEP) model by integrating bootstrap and active learning strategies. Using machine-learned NEP-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the structural and diffusion properties of LiTFSI/G3 across a wide range of the solute-to-solvent ratios, systematically analyzing electrolyte density, ion coordination, viscosity, and lithium self-diffusion. The computed densities show excellent agreement with experimental data, and pair correlation analysis reveals significant interactions between lithium ions and surrounding oxygen atoms, which strongly impacts Li$^+$ mobility. Viscosity and diffusion calculations further demonstrate that increasing LiTFSI concentration enhances Li-O interactions, resulting in higher viscosity and reduced lithium diffusion. Additionally, machine learning-based path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations confirm the negligible impact of quantum effects on Li$^+$ transport. The electrolyte-specific protocol developed in this work provides a systematic framework for constructing high-fidelity machine learning potentials for complex systems.

Title: Magnetic phase diagram of Cr2Te3 revisited by ac magnetostrictive coefficient
Authors: Long Zhang, Zhongzhu Jiang, Yugang Zhang, Jing Zhang, Aifeng Wang, Mingquan He, Yuping Sun, Xuan Luo, Yisheng Chai
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials have attracted considerable interest owing to their potential applications in spintronics and fundamental investigations into low-dimensional magnetism. Cr2Te3, a quasi 2D non van der Waals magnet, exhibits a complex magnetic phase diagram due to competing magnetic interactions within and between layers. However, the precise nature and evolution of these magnetic phases remain unclear. Here, we utilize an ultrahigh-sensitive composite magnetoelectric technique, which probes the ac magnetostrictive coefficient, to systematically explore the temperature magnetic field phase diagram of Cr2Te3 single crystals. Our results reveal the coexistence of multiple magnetic phases, including canted ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic states. Another canted ferromagnetic phase and a possible triple point have been proposed. The updated phase diagram provides deeper insights into the specific spin configurations associated with each phase. These findings also highlight the decoupled magnetic ordering between the Cr1/Cr3 layers and the Cr2 layer near the magnetic ordering temperature.

Title: Emergent properties and the multiscale characterization challenge in condensed matter, from crystals to complex materials: a Review
Authors: Elisabetta Nocerino
Abstract: The complexity of condensed matter arises from emergent behaviors that cannot be understood by analyzing individual constituents in isolation. While traditional condensed-matter approaches-developed primarily for ideal crystalline solids-have provided deep insights into symmetry, order, and electronic structure, they fall short in describing the rich, multiscale organization of hierarchical and soft materials. These systems exhibit structural correlations across multiple length and time scales, often governed by nonlinear interactions that span from molecular to macroscopic domains. This review explores how the convergence of emerging experimental and computational strategies are redefining our ability to characterize and model such systems. We examine how multimodal techniques-combining scattering, imaging, and spectroscopy-can map structural order and dynamics across scales, with methods like small-angle scattering tensor tomography, dark-field imaging, and ultrafast spectroscopies providing unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. On the computational front, machine learning approaches such as graph neural networks, neural operators, and physics-informed models offer powerful tools to connect disparate scales and uncover hidden correlations in high-dimensional data. These advancements have the potential to close the gap between structure and function in complex materials, thereby addressing one of the grand challenges of contemporary material science: understanding and engineering multiscale architectures, whose emergent properties underpin the behavior of next-generation functional materials, biological systems, and adaptive technologies.

Title: Dual Phonon Universe in a Spinor Bose Gas
Authors: Jiabin Wang, Yunfei Xue, Li Chen, Ren Zhang
Abstract: We show the possibility of simulating a dual universe in a pseudospin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), wherein two phononic modes experience distinct curved spacetime metrics. Through ramping the interspecies interaction of the BEC, we observe that one universe expands, and in the mean time, the other contracts. These findings can be directly verified in existing cold-atom experimental setups by detecting the correlators of the scaled density contrast (SDC): The sizes of the expanded/contracted universes can be deduced from the SDC's oscillating frequencies, while the expanding/contracting histories are reflected in the SDC's amplitude. Our study demonstrates the great potential of spinor BECs for exploring multiverse-related physics in laboratory settings.

Title: Mathematical crystal chemistry II: Random search for ionic crystals and analysis on oxide crystals registered in ICSD
Authors: Ryotaro Koshoji
Abstract: Mathematical crystal chemistry views crystal structures as the optimal solutions to mathematical optimization problem formalizing inorganic structural chemistry. This paper introduces the minimum and maximum atomic radii depending on the types of geometrical constraints, extending the concept of effective atomic sizes. These radii define permissible interatomic distances instead of interatomic forces, constraining feasible types and connections of coordination polyhedra. The definition shows the aspect that crystal structures are packings of atomic spheres. Additionally, creatability functions for geometrical constraints, which give a choice of creatable types of geometrical constraints depending on the spatial order of atoms, are implemented to guide randomly generated structures toward optimal solutions. The framework identifies unique optimal solutions corresponding to the structures of spinel, pyrochlore ($\alpha$ and $\beta$), pyroxene, quadruple perovskite, cuprate superconductor $\mathrm{YBa}_2 \mathrm{Cu}_3 \mathrm{O}_{7-x}$, and iron-based superconductor $\mathrm{LaFeAsO}$. Notably, up to $95\%$ of oxide crystal structure types in Inorganic Crystal Structure Database align with the optimal solutions preserving experimental structures despite the discretized feasible atomic radii. These findings highlight the role of mathematical optimization problem as a theoretical foundation for mathematical crystal chemistry, enabling efficient structure prediction.

Title: Quantum Entanglement Generation in the Heterometallic Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ Complexes
Authors: Hamid Arian Zad, Michal Jaščur, Nerses Ananikian
Abstract: We investigate tetrapartite and bipartite quantum entanglement in octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ under an external magnetic field using exact diagonalization. These molecular magnets that can be effectively characterized by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two Ni$^\text{2+}_2$Gd$_2^\text{3+}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. We detect that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, reflecting distinct ground states characteristic of Gd-containing compounds. Using negativity as a quantum entanglement measure, we analyze the effects of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite and bipartite entanglements in two families of Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong tetrapartite entanglement, persisting up to $T \approx 2.5$ K and $B \approx 4.0$ T, but considerably weak bipartite entanglement between Ni$\cdots$Ni and Ni$\cdots$Gd links. Conversely, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ shows strong bipartite entanglements but negligible tetrapartite entanglement negativity. These findings highlight the critical role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping entanglement properties in heterometallic Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ complexes.

Title: Theory of two-electrons optics experiments with smooth potentials: Flying electron molecules
Authors: P.G. Silvestrov, Vyacheslavs Kashcheyevs, Patrik Recher
Abstract: Recent experimental progress in development of on-demand sources of electrons propagating along depleted quantum Hall edge channels has enabled creation and characterization of sufficiently compact single- and two-electron distributions with picosecond scale control and the possibility of measuring details of these distributions. Here, we consider the effects of the long-range Coulomb interaction between two electrons on the real time evolution of such distributions in the experimentally relevant case of smooth guiding and quantum point contact (QPC) potentials. Both Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) and Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) setups are investigated. The theoretical consideration takes advantage of the separation of degrees of freedom leading to the independent motion of the center of mass and the relative motion. The most prominent effect of this separation is the prediction of molecular bound states, into which two electrons can become trapped and propagate as a pair along the center of mass trajectory while simultaneously rotating around each other. The existence of a number of such molecular bound states should naturally strongly affect the outgoing electrons' distribution in the HBT experiment leading to bunching. But also in the HOM setup where colliding electrons are initially spatially separated, we predict new effects due to the quantum tunneling of two electrons colliding at the QPC into the joint molecular bound states. The lifetime of these quasi-bound states is shown to depend on the symmetry of the orbital wave function of the two-electron state giving rise to means to distinguish spin-triplets from spin-singlets (enabling the creation of electronic Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs). As a characteristic signature of the paired states we investigate the probability for both injected electrons to stay a long time at the QPC.

Title: Symmetry resolved out-of-time-order correlators of Heisenberg spin chains using projected matrix product operators
Authors: Martina Gisti, David J. Luitz, Maxime Debertolis
Abstract: We extend the concept of operator charge in the context of an abelian U (1) symmetry and apply this framework to symmetry-preserving matrix product operators (MPOs), enabling the description of operators projected onto specific sectors of the corresponding symmetry. Leveraging this representation, we study the effect of interactions on the scrambling of information in an integrable Heisenberg spin chain, by controlling the number of particles. Our focus lies on out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) which we project on sectors with a fixed number of particles. This allows us to link the non-interacting system to the fully-interacting one by allowing more and more particle to interact with each other, keeping the interaction parameter fixed. While at short times, the OTOCs are almost not affected by interactions, the spreading of the information front becomes gradually faster and the OTOC saturate at larger values as the number of particle increases. We also study the behavior of finite-size systems by considering the OTOCs at times beyond the point where the front hits the boundary of the system. We find that in every sector with more than one particle, the OTOCs behave as if the local operator was rotated by a random unitary matrix, indicating that the presence of boundaries contributes to the maximal scrambling of local operators.

Title: Spatial Control of Charge Doping in n-Type Topological Insulators

Asensio
Abstract: Spatially controlling the Fermi level of topological insulators and keeping its electronic states stable are indispensable processes to put this material into practical use for semiconductor spintronics devices. So far, however, such a method has not been established yet. Here we show a novel method for doping hole into n-type topological insulators Bi$_2$X$_3$ (X= Se, Te) that overcomes the shortcomings of the previous reported methods. The key of this doping is to adsorb H$_2$O on Bi$_2$X$_3$ decorated with a small amount of carbon, and its trigger is the irradiation of photon with sufficient energy to excite core-electrons of the outermost layer atoms. This method allows controlling the doping amount by the irradiation time, and acts as photolithography. Such a tunable doping makes it possible to design the electronic states at the nanometer scale, and thus paves a promising avenue toward the realization of novel spintronics devices based on topological insulators.

Title: Fixed points and critical temperature near quantum critical points in $d$-wave cuprate superconductors
Authors: Qi-Qi Yue, Yi-Sheng Fu, Jing Wang
Abstract: We study the critical behavior driven by potential quantum critical points (QCPs) termed as $\tau_{0,x,y,z}$-Type QCPs in the $d$-wave cuprate superconductors. Within the framework of the renormalization group approach, we construct the coupled flow equations of all interaction parameters and obtain several unique properties. On one hand, the interaction parameters flow toward several fixed points (FPs) at certain critical energy scales. We identify two different types of FPs designated at the clean limit. FP-I is characterized by the divergence of the quadratic parameter and exhibits robustness against variations in interaction parameters. In contrast, FP-II is dominated by the cubic and quartic interaction parameters, and it is sensitive to initial conditions, leading to five subclasses. Besides, we find that disorder scattering can influence fermion velocities and critical energy scales, and even destabilize certain FPs around the $\tau_{x,z}$-QCPs, driving the system toward a preempted disorder-induced FP. On the other hand, we find that quantum fluctuations play a critical role in shaping the critical temperature ($T_c$) as the system approaches these QCPs. Near the $\tau_x$-QCP, $T_c$ is considerably suppressed for both FP-I and FP-II. In contrast, near the $\tau_0$-QCP, $T_c$ undergoes a substantial decrease for FP-I but only a slight decrease for FP-II. Conversely, $T_c$ exhibits an increasing trend near the $\tau_y$-QCP, with a pronounced peak at $v_{\Delta 0}/v_{F0} \sim 0.25$. However, numerical analysis suggests that the $\tau_z$-QCP is unlikely to be physically realizable. Additionally, we realize that $T_c$ can also be modified by the emergence of disorder-induced FPs in the vicinity of the $\tau_x$-QCP. These findings would provide valuable insights into the critical low-energy properties of $d$-wave cuprate superconductors and related materials.

Title: Bipartite particle number fluctuations in dephased long-range lattice systems
Authors: Lokesh Tater, Subhajit Sarkar, Devendra Singh Bhakuni, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of subsystem particle number fluctuations in a long-range system with power-law decaying hopping strength characterized by exponent $\mu$ and subjected to a local dephasing at every site. We introduce an efficient {\it bond length} representation for the four-point correlator, enabling the large-scale simulation of the dynamics of particle number fluctuations from translationally invariant initial states. Our results show that the particle number fluctuation dynamics exhibit one-parameter Family-Vicsek scaling, with superdiffusive scaling exponents for $\mu < 1.5$ and diffusive scaling exponents for $\mu \geq 1.5$. Finally, exploiting the bond-length representation, we provide an exact analytical expression for the particle number fluctuations and their scaling exponents in the short-range limit ($\mu \to \infty)$.

Title: Quantum defects of Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide: A semiclassical spherical model
Authors: Jan Ertl, Patric Rommel, Jörg Main
Abstract: Excitons, i.e. the bound states of an electron and a positively charged hole are the solid state analogue of the hydrogen atom. As such they exhibit a Rydberg series, which in cuprous oxide has been observed up to high principal quantum numbers by T. Kazimierczuk et al. [Nature 514, 343 (2014)]. In this energy regime the quantum mechanical properties of the system can be understood in terms of classical orbits by the application of semiclassical techniques. In fact the first theoretical explanation of the spectrum of the hydrogen atom within Bohr's atomic model was a semiclassical one using classical orbits and a quantization condition for the angular momentum. Contrary to the hydrogen atom, the degeneracy of states with the same principal quantum number $n$ is lifted in exciton spectra. This is similar to the situation in alkali atoms, where these splittings are caused by the interaction of the excited electron with the ionic core. For excitons in cuprous oxide, these splittings occur due to the influence of the complex band structure of the crystal. Using an adiabatic approach and analytically derived energy surfaces, we develop a semiclassical spherical model and determine, via semiclassical torus quantization, the quantum defects of various angular momentum states.

Title: Novel Easy-Axis Switching through Metamagnetism in CeSb$_2$
Authors: Atsushi Miyake, Ryuta Hayasaka, Hiroto Fukuda, Masaki Kondo, Yuto Kinoshita, Dexin Li, Ai Nakamura, Yusei Shimizu, Yoshiya Homma, Fuminori Honda, Masashi Tokunaga, Dai Aoki
Abstract: A novel magnetic field-induced switching of the magnetization easy axis has been discovered in the layered compound CeSb$_2$, which crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with nearly identical lattice constants along the a- and b-axes, giving it a tetragonal-like appearance. When a magnetic field is applied along an orthorhombic in-plane axis at 4.2 K, magnetization increases abruptly around 34 T, followed by a hysteresis loop upon decreasing the field. Subsequent measurements reveal a significantly enhanced magnetization, indicative of a switch of the magnetization easy axis. Conversely, the other orthorhombic in-plane axis becomes the magnetization hard axis. Surprisingly, the easy axis is switchable by changing the field direction to the other orthorhombic in-plane axis. Moreover, this memory effect is stable up to room temperature. Polarized light microscope images have visually revealed domain formation of the as-cast samples and domain rearrangement by magnetic fields. This intriguing axis-conversion phenomenon is a novel magnetic shape memory effect for heat cycles up to room temperature. It is attributed to the specific in-plane Ce-pantograph networks in CeSb$_2$.

Abstract: The room temperature X-ray photoemission spectrum of the ferromagnetic compound UCu$_2$Si$_2$ (T$_C$ = 100 K) was measured using an Al K$_{\alpha}$ source. Related theoretical spectra were computed from densities of electronic states obtained in the local density approximation (LDA), the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and using the GGA+U method. The calculated spectrum is in a good agreement with the experimental one. The spin polarized calculations based on the GGA+U approach as well as GGA/LSDA with orbital polarization (OP) corrections taken into account provide values of the total magnetic moment in reasonable agreement with the experimental values ranging between 1.6 and 2.0 $\mu_B$/U atom.

Title: Topological Degeneracy Induced Flat Bands in two-Dimensional Holed Systems
Authors: Yuge Chen, Hui Yu, Yun-Peng Huang, Zhen-Yu Zheng, Jiangping Hu
Abstract: Systems hosting flat bands offer a powerful platform for exploring strong correlation physics. Theoretically topological degeneracy rising in systems with non-trivial topological orders on periodic manifolds of non-zero genus can generate ideal flat bands. However, experimental realization of such geometrically engineered systems is very difficult. In this work, we demonstrate that flat planes with strategically patterned hole defects can engineer ideal flat bands. We constructing two families of models, singular flat band systems where degeneracy is stabilized by non-contractible loop excitations tied to hole defects and perfectly nested van Hove systems where degeneracy arises from line excitations in momentum space. These models circumvent the need for exotic manifolds while retaining the essential features of topological flat bands. By directly linking defect engineering to degeneracy mechanisms, our results establish a scalable framework for experimentally accessible flat band design.

Title: Broken symmetry states and Quantum Hall Ferromagnetism in decoupled twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Vineet Pandey, Prasenjit Ghosh, Riju Pal, Sourav Paul, Abhijith M B, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Atindra Nath Pal, Vidya Kochat
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) with large twist angle is a novel 2D bilayer system with strong interlayer Coulomb interactions, whilst suppressed interlayer carrier tunneling due to momentum mismatch between the Dirac cones of individual graphene layers. This interlayer decoherence disentangles the layer degree of freedom from spin-valley space. We demonstrate the role of charge screening effects in electronically decoupled TBLG that determines the Landau level (LL) crossings and multicomponent Quantum Hall (QH) effect resulting from combinations of broken symmetry states with spin and valley flavors of constituent this http URL N = 0 LL at zero filling factor is characterized by a field-induced Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to an ordered ground state, consistent with predictions of intervalley coherent state of Kekulé order. Pronounced hysteresis and electron-hole asymmetry observed in the QH regime suggests pinning of low-energy topological excitations, i.e., skyrmions with spin and valley textures, at charged defects in graphene channel.

Title: Coupled electromigration-nanoindentation study on dislocation nucleation in SrTiO3
Authors: Chukwudalu Okafor, Ahmad Sayyadi-Shahraki, Sebastian Bruns, Till Frömling, Pierre Hirel, Phillipe Carrez, Karsten Durst, Xufei Fang
Abstract: Modern functional oxides are mainly engineered by doping, essentially by tuning the defect chemistry. Recent studies suggest that dislocations offer a new perspective for enhancing the mechanical and physical properties of ceramic oxides. This raises the question regarding the interaction between dislocations and point defects in ceramics. Here, we report the impact of defect chemistry on the mechanical response of single-crystal strontium titanate, a prototype perovskite oxide. We demonstrate that electric field-induced stoichiometry polarization alters the defect chemistry, primarily by tuning oxygen vacancies, resulting in a distinct difference in the maximum shear stresses for dislocation nucleation, as experimentally observed and corroborated by molecular dynamic simulation. The impact of indenter tip size and geometry on the dislocation nucleation behavior in samples with different point defect concentrations in ceramics is further elucidated. Similar to the electromigration findings, acceptor-doped SrTiO3 tends to promote dislocation nucleation due to the abundance of oxygen vacancies. These findings shed new light on the interaction between dislocations and point defects in oxides. They may pave the road for assessing the stability of the next-generation functional ceramics engineered by dislocations.

Title: Large-Scale, Long-Time Atomistic Simulations of Proton Transport in Polymer Electrolyte Membranes Using a Neural Network Interatomic Potential
Authors: Yuta Yoshimoto, Naoki Matsumura, Yuto Iwasaki, Hiroshi Nakao, Yasufumi Sakai
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have attracted significant attention as a method that enables large-scale, long-time atomistic simulations while maintaining accuracy comparable to electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio wavefunction theories. However, a challenge with MLIP-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is their lower stability compared to those using conventional classical potentials. Analyzing highly heterogeneous systems or amorphous materials often requires large-scale and long-time simulations, necessitating the development of robust MLIPs that allow for stable MD simulations. In this study, using our neural network potential (NNP) generator, we construct an NNP model that enables large-scale, long-time MD simulations of perfluorinated ionomer membranes (Nafion) across a wide range of hydration levels. We successfully build a robust deep potential (DP) model by iteratively expanding the dataset through active-learning loops. Specifically, by combining the sampling of off-equilibrium structures via non-equilibrium DPMD simulations with the structure screening in a 3D structural feature space incorporating minimum interatomic distances, it is possible to significantly enhance the robustness of the DP model, which allows for stable MD simulations of large Nafion systems ranging from approximately 10,000 to 20,000 atoms for an extended duration of 31 ns. The MD simulations employing the developed DP model yield self-diffusion coefficients of hydrogen atoms that more closely match experimental values in a wide range of hydration levels compared to previous ab initio MD simulations of smaller systems.

Title: Switching on Antiferroelectrics
Authors: G. Catalan, A. Gruverman, J. Íñiguez-González, D. Meier, M. Trassin
Abstract: Antiferroelectrics attract broad attention due to their unusual physical characteristics, chief among which is the double-hysteresis loop that separates their antipolar ground state from the voltage-induced polar phase, which is promising for applications in energy storage and electrocaloric cooling. However, their defining features (antipolar ground state and double-hysteresis loops) are increasingly challenged: materials with non-collinear and/or hybrid polar-antipolar order have been discovered, and double-hysteresis has been realized in materials without a conventional antipolar ground state. These developments add to the intensifying interest in fundamental and practical aspects of antiferroelectrics, and call for a fresh look at antiferroelectricity. In this Perspective, we provide an updated and all-encompassing definition of antiferroelectricity, discuss material systems with new antipolar orders and/or engineered double hysteresis, and reflect on emergent properties and theoretical approaches. This work casts a bird's eye view on the rapidly evolving trends that are shaping up the research on ferroics with antipolar order.

Title: Localizing entropy production along non-equilibrium trajectories
Authors: Biswajit Das, Sreekanth K Manikandan
Abstract: An important open problem in nonequilibrium thermodynamics is the quantification and spatiotemporal localization of entropy production in complex nanoscale processes from experimental data. Here we address this issue through a data-driven approach that combines the recently developed short-time thermodynamic uncertainty relation based inference scheme with machine learning techniques. Our approach leverages the flexible function representation provided by deep neural networks to achieve accurate reconstruction of high-dimensional, potentially time-dependent dissipative force fields as well as the localization of entropy production in both space and time along nonequilibrium trajectories. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework through applications to diverse systems of fundamental interest and experimental significance, where it successfully addresses distinct challenges in localizing entropy production.

Title: Estimates of the dynamic structure factor for the finite temperature electron liquid via analytic continuation of path integral Monte Carlo data
Authors: Thomas Chuna, Nicholas Barnfield, Jan Vorberger, Michael P. Friedlander, Tim Hoheisel, Tobias Dornheim
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic properties of the uniform electron gas (UEG) is important for numerous applications ranging from semiconductor physics to exotic warm dense matter. In this work, we apply the maximum entropy method (MEM), as implemented in Chuna \emph{et al.}~[arXiv:2501.01869], to \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for the imaginary-time correlation function $F(q,\tau)$ to estimate the dynamic structure factor $S(q,\omega)$ over an unprecedented range of densities at the electronic Fermi temperature. To conduct the MEM, we propose to construct the Bayesian prior $\mu$ from the PIMC data. Constructing the static approximation leads to a drastic improvement in $S(q,\omega)$ estimate over using the more simple random phase approximation (RPA) as the Bayesian prior. We find good agreement with existing results by Dornheim \emph{et al.}~[\textit{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.}~\textbf{121}, 255001 (2018)], where they are available. In addition, we present new results for the strongly coupled electron liquid regime with $r_s=50,...,200$, which reveal a pronounced roton-type feature and an incipient double peak structure in $S(q,\omega)$ at intermediate wavenumbers. We also find that our dynamic structure factors satisfy known sum rules, even though these sum rules are not enforced explicitly. An advantage of our set-up is that it is not specific to the UEG, thereby opening up new avenues to study the dynamics of real warm dense matter systems based on cutting-edge PIMC simulations in future works.

Title: Enhanced plasmonic absorption in spontaneous nanocomplexes of metal nanoparticles with surface modified HPHT nanodiamonds
Authors: Vendula Hrncirova, Marketa Slapal Barinkova, Muhammad Qamar, Katerina Kolarova, Jaroslav Kulicek, Stepan Stehlik, Alexander Kromka, Bohuslav Rezek
Abstract: The combination of nanodiamonds with plasmonic metal particles is being explored for synergic effects that can enhance biosensing and antibacterial treatments, energy harvesting, photocatalysis, and quantum centres. Here we systematically investigate the formation and plasmonic properties of complexes assembled in colloidal mixtures of 20 nm gold or silver nanoparticles with 50 nm HPHT nanodiamonds, the surfaces of which are oxidized or hydrogenated. This approach provides nanocomplexes of well-defined particles with different surface chemistry and electrical conductivity. Nanoscale complexes are formed in each case, as shown by scanning electron microscopy and optical absorption spectra. The stable plasmonic frequency shows that the metal nanoparticles do not become aggregated and keep a few nm gap to nanodiamonds. The concentration dependence study reveals that the plasmonic effect can be significantly increased (up to 124 %) for lower concentrations of metal nanoparticles in the mixtures, whereas their higher concentrations reduce it, regardless of the type of nanodiamond or metal nanoparticle. Based on the experimental results and electromagnetic field-based simulations of the complexes, we discuss a model involving competing charge redistribution and plasmonic interference effects.

Title: Effective and asymptotic scaling in a one-dimensional billiard problem
Authors: Taras Holovatch, Yuri Kozitsky, Krzysztof Pilorz, Yurij Holovatch
Abstract: The emergence of power laws that govern the large-time dynamics of a one-dimensional billiard of $N$ point particles is analysed. In the initial state, the resting particles are placed in the positive half-line $x\geq 0$ at equal distances. Their masses alternate between two distinct values. The dynamics is initialized by giving the leftmost particle a positive velocity. Due to elastic inter-particle collisions the whole system gradually comes into motion, filling both right and left half-lines. As shown by S. Chakraborti, A. Dhar, P. Krapivsky, SciPost Phys. 13 (2022) 074, an inherent feature of such a billiard is the emergence of two different modes: the shock wave that propagates in $x\geq 0$ and the splash region in $x<0$. Moreover, the behaviour of the relevant observables is characterized by universal asymptotic power-law dependencies. In view of the finite size of the system and of finite observation times, these dependencies only start to acquire a universal character. To analyse them, we set up molecular dynamics simulations using the concept of effective scaling exponents, familiar in the theory of continuous phase transitions. We present results for the effective exponents that govern the large-time behaviour of the shock-wave front, the number of collisions, the energies and momentum of different modes and analyse their tendency to approach corresponding universal values.

Title: Topological states in one-dimensional $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric systems
Authors: Vladimir Gasparian, Peng Guo, Antonio Pérez Garrido, Esther Jódar
Abstract: We obtain a closed form expression for the energy spectrum of $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric superlattice systems with complex potentials of periodic sets of two $\delta$-potentials in the elementary cell. In the presence of periodic gain and loss we analyzed in detail a diatomic crystal model, varying either the scatterer distances or the potential heights. It is shown that at a certain critical value of the imaginary part of the complex amplitude, topological states depending on the lattice size and the configuration of the unit cell can disappear. This may happened at the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking (exceptional) points.

Title: Hybridization of lattice and charge order excitations in a superconducting cuprate
Authors: S. M. Souliou, D. Ishikawa, R. Heid, D. Bessas, H.H. Kim, D. Betto, S. Nakata, M. Merz, M. Minola, B. Keimer, A.Q.R. Baron, M. Le Tacon
Abstract: The ubiquitous tendency of high-temperature superconducting cuprates to form charge density waves has reignited interest in the enigmatic nature of their electron-phonon interaction and its role in shaping their complex phase diagrams. While pronounced anomalies in the dispersion of several phonon branches have been reported, their precise connection to charge order and superconductivity remains unresolved. Here, using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering under extreme conditions of low temperature and high magnetic field we uncover a striking renormalization of the phonon spectra in the model cuprate YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. It appears along a reciprocal space trajectory connecting two emblematic CDW states: a two-dimensional short-range CDW emerging above the superconducting transition and a three-dimensional long-range CDW that appears only when superconductivity is suppressed by a strong magnetic field or uniaxial compression. The spectral changes are strongest at the wave vector corresponding to the 3D CDW order despite the fact that the CDW is absent in our experimental conditions. Our findings challenge conventional phonon self-energy renormalization models and instead support a scenario in which low-energy phonons hybridize with dispersive charge-density-wave excitations. These results provide fresh insights into the intricate interplay between lattice vibrations and electronic correlations in high-temperature superconductors.

Title: Programming frictionless interfaces for moiré layers
Authors: Zichong Zhang, Shuze Zhu
Abstract: Structural superlubricity in van der Waals layered systems holds immense promise for diverse nanoscale contacts devices and energy-efficient applications. While all-direction structural superlubricity has been widely investigated, the understanding towards the more fundamental directional structural superlubricity requires further attentions. In this study, we reveal the physical origins of directional structural superlubricity, which reduces to all-direction superlubricity under certain conditions. By investigating the evolution of incomplete moiré tiles at crystalline interfaces, our general scaling approaches establish the mapping from geometry to tunable directional superlubricity, agreeing with large scale molecular dynamics simulations at both homogeneous or heterogeneous interfaces. Furthermore, diverse programmable frictionless motions of nanoflakes traveling inside double-surface nanoconfinement systems can be achieved. Our work delivers new insights into the design of ultra-low frictional interfaces for future nanoscale tribology and nanoconfinement transport.

Title: Are there type-III multiferroics?
Authors: Haojin Wang, Haitao Liu, Meng Ye, Yuanchang Li
Abstract: Multiferroics are known to be classified into two types. However, type-I lacks sufficient magnetoelectric coupling and type-II lacks sufficient electric polarization, making both practically difficult. In this work, we explore the possibility of type-III multiferroics, where the origins of ferroelectricity and magnetism are highly intertwined but not causally related, with a combination of strong magnetoelectric coupling and large polarization. Our first-principles calculations predict that monolayer TiCdO$_{4}$ is such a type-III ferroelectric-ferromagnetic multiferroics with both electronic and magnetic orders originating from competing electron populations on oxygen atoms. It shows an electric polarization of 50 $\mu$C/m$^{2}$ while the maximum linear and quadratic magnetoelectric response are as high as 35000 ps/m and 1.59 $\times$ 10$^{-14}$ s/A, respectively. Our study opens up new perspectives for the discovery and design of much-anticipated multiferroics that can be used for cross-modulation.

Title: Symmetry Enhanced Unconventional Spin Current Anisotropy in a Collinear Antiferromagnet
Authors: Pankhuri Gupta, Kacho Imtiyaz Ali Khan, Akash Kumar, Rekha Agarwal, Nidhi Kandwal, Ram Singh Yadav, Pranaba Kishor Muduli, Johan Åkerman
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) presents a promising avenue for energy-efficient spintronics devices, surpassing the limitations of spin transfer torque. While extensively studied in heavy metals, SOT in antiferromagnetic quantum materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate SOT in epitaxial FeSn, a collinear antiferromagnet with a kagome lattice. FeSn exhibits intriguing topological quantum features, including two-dimensional flat bands and Dirac-like surface states, making it an ideal platform for investigating emergent SOT properties. Using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance, we uncover a six-fold symmetric damping-like SOT in epitaxial-FeSn/Py heterostructures, reflecting the six-fold symmetry of the epitaxial [0001]-oriented FeSn films. Additionally, we observe a substantial unconventional field-like torque, originating from spin currents with out-of-plane spin polarization. This torque exhibits a unique angular dependence-a superposition of six-fold crystalline symmetry and uniaxial symmetry associated with the antiferromagnetic spin Hall effect. Notably, the unconventional field-like torque is enhanced when the RF current flows along the Neel vector in FeSn. Our findings reveal an unconventional spin current anisotropy tunable by crystalline and magnetic symmetry, offering a novel approach for controlling SOT in antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Title: Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D
Authors: Yantao Wu, Wen-Yuan Liu
Abstract: We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which simplifies existing algorithms already for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining variational Monte Carlo, enabling efficient variational optimization for (2+1)D LGT ground states with gauge and matter fields. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate simulation of pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory, odd-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32\times 32$. Our work establishes gauge-invariant PEPS as a powerful approach to simulate (2+1)D Abelian LGTs.

Title: Experiments and modeling of mechanically-soft, hard magnetorheological foams with potential applications in haptic sensing
Authors: Zehui Lin, Zahra Hooshmand-Ahoor, Laurence Bodelot, Kostas Danas
Abstract: This study proposes a novel mechanically-soft and magnetically-hard magnetorheological foam that, upon deformation, leads to robust and measurable magnetic flux changes in its surroundings. This allows to infer qualitatively and even quantitatively the imposed deformation and, eventually from that, an estimation of the stiffness and average stress on the sample even in complex loading scenarios involving combinations of uniform or nonuniform compression/tension with superposed shearing at in different directions. The work provides a complete experimental, theoretical and numerical framework on finite strain, compressible magneto-elasticity, thereby allowing to measure and predict coupled magneto-mechanical properties of such materials and then use it to estimate and design potential haptic sensing devices.

Title: Structured Random Binding: a minimal model of protein-protein interactions
Authors: Ling-Nan Zou
Abstract: We describe Structured Random Binding (SRB), a minimal model of protein-protein interactions rooted in the statistical physics of disordered systems. In this model, nonspecific binding is a generic consequence of the interaction between random proteins, exhibiting a phase transition from a high temperature state where nonspecific complexes are transient and lack well-defined interaction interfaces, to a low temperature state where the complex structure is frozen and a definite interaction interface is present. Numerically, weakly-bound nonspecific complexes can evolve into tightly-bound, highly specific complexes, but only if the structural correlation length along the peptide backbone is short; moreover, evolved tightly-bound homodimers favor the same interface structure that is predominant in real protein homodimers.

Title: An electrically controlled single molecule spin switch
Authors: Wantong Huang, Kwan Ho Au-Yeung, Paul Greule, Máté Stark, Christoph Sürgers, Wolfgang Wernsdorfer, Roberto Robles, Nicolas Lorente, Philip Willke
Abstract: Precise control of spin states and spin-spin interactions in atomic-scale magnetic structures is crucial for spin-based quantum technologies. A promising architecture is molecular spin systems, which offer chemical tunability and scalability for larger structures. An essential component, in addition to the qubits themselves, is switchable qubit-qubit interactions that can be individually addressed. In this study, we present an electrically controlled single-molecule spin switch based on a bistable complex adsorbed on an insulating magnesium oxide film. The complex, which consists of an Fe adatom coupled to an iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecule, can be reversibly switched between two stable states using voltage pulses locally via the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). Inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy (IETS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a distinct change between a paramagnetic and a non-magnetic spin configuration. Lastly, we demonstrate the functionality of this molecular spin switch by using it to modify the electron spin resonance (ESR) frequency of a nearby target FePc spin within a spin-spin coupled structure. Thus, we showcase how individual molecular machines can be utilized to create scalable and tunable quantum devices.

Title: When invariants matter: The role of I1 and I2 in neural network models of incompressible hyperelasticity
Authors: Franz Dammaß, Karl A. Kalina, Markus Kästner
Abstract: For the formulation of machine learning-based material models, the usage of invariants of deformation tensors is attractive, since this can a priori guarantee objectivity and material symmetry. In this work, we consider incompressible, isotropic hyperelasticity, where two invariants I1 and I2 are required for depicting a deformation state. First, we aim at enhancing the understanding of the invariants. We provide an explicit representation of the set of invariants that are admissible, i.e. for which (I1, I2) a deformation state does indeed exist. Furthermore, we prove that uniaxial and equi-biaxial deformation correspond to the boundary of the set of admissible invariants. Second, we study how the experimentally-observed behaviour of different materials can be captured by means of neural network models of incompressible hyperelasticity, depending on whether both I1 and I2 or solely one of the invariants, i.e. either only I1 or only I2, are taken into account. To this end, we investigate three different experimental data sets from the literature. In particular, we demonstrate that considering only one invariant, either I1 or I2, can allow for good agreement with experiments in case of small deformations. In contrast, it is necessary to consider both invariants for precise models at large strains, for instance when rubbery polymers are deformed. Moreover, we show that multiaxial experiments are strictly required for the parameterisation of models considering I2. Otherwise, if only data from uniaxial deformation is available, significantly overly stiff responses could be predicted for general deformation states. On the contrary, I1-only models can make qualitatively correct predictions for multiaxial loadings even if parameterised only from uniaxial data, whereas I2-only models are completely incapable in even qualitatively capturing experimental stress data at large deformations.

Abstract: The metallic oxide RuO$_2$ had emerged as a promising altermagnet candidate, owing to reports of this material hosting antiferromagnetic ordering accompanied by a spin-split electronic band structure characteristic of time-reversal symmetry-breaking. However, recent studies have robustly questioned this orthodoxy. In particular, surface-sensitive probes have detected unusual surface states that may exhibit several characteristics expected for an altermagnet, challenging the determination of the intrinsic magnetic and electronic properties of the bulk. Here we map the Fermi surface of pristine single-crystalline RuO$_2$. By measuring magnetic quantum oscillations of a bulk thermodynamic property, our study resolves the electronic structure present in the bulk of RuO$_2$. Several Fermi sheets are discerned, with heavy effective quasiparticle masses up to five times that of the bare electron mass, indicative of strong electronic correlations. We compare our measurements with the predictions for altermagnetic and nonmagnetic Fermi surfaces deduced from density functional theory calculations. The quantum oscillatory frequency spectra correspond very poorly to the profile expected for the case of altermagnetism; by contrast, they correspond well to the nonmagnetic scenario. Our findings place strong constraints on the bulk magnetic properties of RuO$_2$.

Title: Effective two- and three-body interactions between dressed impurities in a tilted double-well potential
Authors: F. Theel, A. G. Volosniev, D. Diplaris, F. Brauneis, S. I. Mistakidis, P. Schmelcher
Abstract: We explore the impact and scaling of effective interactions between two and three impurity atoms, induced by a bosonic medium, on their density distributions. To facilitate the detection of mediated interactions, we propose a setup where impurities are trapped in a tilted double-well potential, while the medium is confined to a ring. The tilt of the potential breaks the spatial inversion symmetry allowing us to exploit the population of the energetically elevated well as a probe of induced interactions. For two impurities, the interaction with the medium reduces the impurity population at the energetically elevated well, which we interpret as evidence of induced impurity-impurity attraction. Furthermore, the impact of an induced three-body interaction is unveiled by comparing the predictions of an effective three-body model with many-body simulations. We extend our study for induced interactions to a three-component mixture containing distinguishable impurities. Our results suggest pathways to detect and tune induced two- and three-body interactions.

Title: A systematic approach for quantitative orientation and phase fraction analysis of thin films through grazing incidence X-ray diffraction
Authors: Fabian Gasser, Sanjay John, Jorid Smets, Josef Simbrunner, Mario Fratschko, Víctor Rubio-Giménez, Rob Ameloot, Hans-Georg Steinrück, Roland Resel
Abstract: Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) is widely used for the structural characterization of thin films, particularly for analyzing phase composition and the orientation distribution of crystallites. While various tools exist for qualitative evaluation, a widely applicable systematic procedure to achieve quantitative information has not yet been developed. This work presents a first step in that direction, allowing accurate quantitative information to be achieved through the evaluation of radial line profiles from GIXD data. An algorithm is introduced for computing radial line profiles based on the crystal structure of known compounds. By fitting experimental data with calculated line profiles, accurate quantitative information about orientation distribution and phase composition is obtained, along with additional parameters such as mosaicity and total crystal volume. The approach is demonstrated using three distinct thin film systems, highlighting the broad applicability of the algorithm. This method provides a systematic and general approach to obtaining quantitative information from GIXD data.

Title: The role of fluctuations in the nucleation process
Authors: Yuanpeng Deng, Peilin Kang, Xiang Xu, Hui Li, Michele Parrinello
Abstract: The emergence upon cooling of an ordered solid phase from a liquid is a remarkable example of self-assembly, which has also major practical relevance. Here, we use a recently developed committor-based enhanced sampling method [Kang et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460 (2024); Trizio et al., arXiv:2410.17029 (2024)] to explore the crystallization transition in a Lennard-Jones fluid, using Kolmogorov's variational principle. In particular, we take advantage of the properties of our sampling method to harness a large number of configurations from the transition state ensemble. From this wealth of data, we achieve precise localization of the transition state region, revealing a nucleation pathway that deviates from idealized spherical growth assumptions. Furthermore, we take advantage of the probabilistic nature of the committor to detect and analyze the fluctuations that lead to nucleation. Our study nuances classical nucleation theory by showing that the growing nucleus has a complex structure, consisting of a solid core surrounded by a disordered interface. We also compute from the Kolmogorov's principle a nucleation rate that is consistent with the experimental results at variance with previous computational estimates.

Title: Growth of Highly Conductive PtSe2 Films Controlled by Raman Metrics for High-Frequency Photodetectors and Optoelectronic Mixers at 1.55 μm
Authors: Eva Desgué, Ivan Verschueren, Marin Tharrault, Djordje Dosenovic, Ludovic Largeau, Eva Grimaldi, Delphine Pommier, Doriane Jussey, Bérangère Moreau, Dominique Carisetti, Laurent Gangloff, Patrick Plouhinec, Naomie Messudom, Zineb Bouyid, Didier Pribat, Julien Chaste, Abdelkarim Ouerghi, Bernard Plaçais, Emmanuel Baudin, Hanako Okuno, Pierre Legagneux
Abstract: Two-dimensional PtSe2 exhibits outstanding intrinsic properties such as high carrier mobility, tunable bandgap, broadband absorption and air stability, making it ideal for (opto)electronic applications. However, achieving high crystalline quality films with controlled properties on low cost and insulating substrates remains challenging. Here, highly crystalline semimetallic PtSe2 films are grown by molecular beam epitaxy on sapphire substrates. It is shown that a post-growth annealing remarkably improves the out-of-plane crystallinity of multilayer films and leads to the record film conductivity of 1.6 mS. In-depth structural analyses reveal the strong influence of the domain arrangement within the film on its electrical conductivity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the commonly used Eg Raman peak width, but also the A1g peak width, are both effective metrics for evaluating the quality of PtSe2: films with thinner Eg and A1g peaks exhibit higher in-plane and out-of-plane crystalline quality, as well as higher conductivity. Finally, coplanar waveguides integrating a semimetallic PtSe2 channel are fabricated on a 2-inch sapphire substrate to demonstrate optoelectronic devices operating at the 1.55 um telecom wavelength: photodetectors with a record bandwidth of 60 GHz and the first PtSe2-based optoelectronic mixer with a 30 GHz bandwidth.

Title: (Dis)continuous buckling transition in elastic shell mediated by contact
Authors: Takara Abe, Tomohiko G. Sano
Abstract: Snap-buckling is a rapid shape transition in slender structures, appearing as a fundamental switching mechanism of natural and man-made systems. Boundary conditions of structures are crucial to predict and control their snap-buckling behavior. However, the general framework that relates boundary conditions, geometry, and performance of structures is still absent to date. Here, we study the snap-buckling of hemispherical shells in contact with rigid cylinders of different diameters to uncover the roles of boundary conditions in the dynamic performance of shells. Specifically, we analyze the jumping dynamics of the pneumatically inverted shells placed on the rigid cylinder by combining experiments and analytical theory. We find the characteristic diameter classifying the snap-buckling and jumping dynamics into two: (i)~if the diameter of the cylinder is sufficiently larger than the characteristic diameter, the shell is regarded as in contact with the infinitely large flat plate, (ii)~if not, the cylinder is regarded as a point. The analytical predictions for the jumping performance of the shell supplemented with the characteristic diameter are in excellent agreement with our experimental results. Our study clarifies that contact geometry is crucial in predicting the pathway of snap-buckling, indicating that the dynamic performance of soft robots would be optimized by tuning their surface geometry.

Title: Fluctuation-dissipation of the Kuramoto model on fruit-fly connectomes
Authors: Géza Ódor, István Papp, Gustavo Deco
Abstract: We investigate the distance from equilibrium using the Kuramoto model via the degree of fluctuation-dissipation violation as the consequence of different levels of edge weight anisotropies. This is achieved by solving the synchronization equations on the raw, homeostatic weighted and a random inhibitory edge variant of a real full fly (FF) connectome, containing $\simeq 10^5$ neuron cell nodes. We investigate these systems close to their synchronization transition critical points. While the topological(graph) dimension is high: $d \simeq 6$ the spectral dimensions of the variants, relevant in describing the synchronization behavior, are lower than the upper critical dimension: $d_s \simeq 2 < d_c=4$, suggesting relevant fluctuation effects and non mean-field scaling behavior. By measuring the auto-correlations and the auto-response functions for small perturbations we calculate the fluctuation-dissipation ratios (FDR) for the different variants of different anisotropy levels of the FF connectome. Numerical evidence is presented that the FDRs follow the level of anisotropy of these non-equilibrium systems in agreement with the expectations. We also compare these results with those on a symmetric random graph of similar size. We provide a detailed network analysis of the FF connectome and calculate the level of hierarchy, also related to the anisotropy. Finally, we provide some partial results for the periodic forced Kuramoto, the Shinomoto-Kuramoto model.

Title: Flow of a two-dimensional liquid foam: Impact of surfactant type and boundary conditions
Authors: Farshad Nazari, Andrei Potanin, Hadi Mohammadigoushki
Abstract: In this study, we experimentally investigate the rheological and flow behavior of two-dimensional (2D) monodisperse aqueous foams, sheared between parallel plates using a custom-made rheo-optical apparatus with smooth and roughened walls. The foams were prepared using two commercially available detergents, Foam 1 and Foam2, while maintaining similar bubble sizes and liquid fractions. The linear viscoelastic results reveal that the Foam 1 consistently exhibits higher elastic and loss moduli than the Foam 2, regardless of boundary conditions, with roughened walls further enhancing these moduli in both foams. Additionally, the Foam 1 shows a lower viscoelastic relaxation frequency compared to the Foam 2, indicating a less mobile interface for the Foam 1. In the non-linear regime, significant differences were observed. Under smooth boundary conditions, Foam 2 exhibits yield stress behavior, whereas Foam 1 does not, despite having higher viscous stresses. The viscous stress in the Foam 1 scales with the capillary number, while for the Foam 2, the scaling depends on the boundary conditions differently for smooth walls and for roughened walls. These variations in rheological behavior are attributed to differences in surfactant chemistry, leading to different interface mobilities, with the Foam1 having a less mobile interface compared to the Foam 2.

Title: Edelstein Effect in Isotropic and Anisotropic Rashba Models
Authors: Irene Gaiardoni, Mattia Trama, Alfonso Maiellaro, Claudio Guarcello, Francesco Romeo, Roberta Citro
Abstract: We investigate spin-to-charge conversion via the Edelstein effect in a 2D Rashba electron gas using the semiclassical Boltzmann approach. We analyze the magnetization arising from the direct Edelstein effect, taking into account an anisotropic Rashba model. We study how this effect depends on the effective masses and Rashba spin--orbit coupling parameters, extracting analytical expressions for the high electronic density regime. {Indeed, it is possible to manipulate the anisotropy introduced into the system through these parameters to achieve a boost in the Edelstein response compared to the isotropic Rashba model.} We also discuss the theoretical framework to study the inverse Edelstein effect and calculate self-consistently the electric current induced by the proximity of the system to a ferromagnet. These results provide insights into the role of Rashba spin--orbit coupling and anisotropic effects in spin--charge conversion phenomena.

Title: Prospect for measuring work statistics in quantum coherent systems
Authors: Cheolhee Han, Nadav Katz, Eran Sela
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics is concerned with heat and work exchange between a quantum coherent system and heat reservoirs or work agents. In stochastic thermodynamcis a key object of interest is the statistics of these quantities, but it is notoriously difficult to measure it in general systems. Here we discuss the prospect for measuring work statistics in electronic devices, via a study of a transmon-microcavity system. The microwave cavity acts as a work agent, exchanging work with the transmon. We formulate a protocol to measure the first moments of work $\langle W^n \rangle$ via photon number detection. We find conditions for capturing quantum coherence in the work statistics. Interestingly, by measuring higher moments one can verify the Jarzynski equality $\langle e^{-W/T} \rangle = 1$ including quantum interference. Our work opens a way for measuring work statistics in nontrivial quantum systems.

Title: Controlling magnetic damping with spintronic thermal effects in Py/Fe3O4-PANI bilayers
Authors: José Laurentino, Carlos Eduardo, Luiza Paffer, José Araújo, José Holanda
Abstract: We report experiments that control magnetic damping in Py/Fe3O4-PANI via two spintronic thermal effects: spin Seebeck and anomalous Nernst. Magnetic damping is measured using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) techniques, where the sample is excited by microwave radiation and the resulting DC voltage is detected in the Fe3O4-PANI film. When a temperature gradient is applied in the longitudinal configuration, the DC voltage linewidth increases or decreases depending on the direction of the thermal gradient. This finding demonstrates that magnetic damping in Py/Fe3O4-PANI can be controlled by currents induced by thermal effects. Remarkably, the absolute linewidth changes observed in Py/Fe3O4-PANI exceed those seen in bilayers of ferrimagnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet and heavy metal by more than an order of magnitude. We interpret the significant change in magnetic damping as a result of intrinsic phenomena occurring in bilayers.

Title: Macroscopic suppression of supersonic quantum transport
Authors: Jérémy Faupin, Marius Lemm, Israel Michael Sigal, Jingxuan Zhang
Abstract: We consider a broad class of strongly interacting quantum lattice gases, including the Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models. We focus on macroscopic particle clusters of size $\theta N$, with $\theta\in(0,1)$ and $N$ the total particle number, and we study the quantum probability that such a cluster is transported across a distance $r$ within time $t$. Conventional effective light cone arguments yield a bound of the form $\exp(v t-r)$. We report a substantially stronger bound $\exp(\theta N(vt-r))$, which provides exponential suppression that scales with system size. Our result establishes a universal dynamical principle: macroscopic suppression of supersonic macroscopic transport (MASSMAT).

Title: The importance of Berry phase in solar acoustic modes
Authors: Armand Leclerc, Guillaume Laibe
Abstract: An analytic expression for the frequencies of standing waves in stars, applicable to any radial order n, is derived from ray-tracing equations by the mean of Wigner-Weyl calculus. A correction to previous formulas currently employed in asteroseismology is identified as the Berry phase, which accounts for the vectorial nature of wave propagation in stars. Accounting for this quantity significantly improves upon previous laws for low n modes of the Sun, and we show that the Berry phase is indeed present in the available observational data of solar modes. This phase is due to inhomogeneities of the medium.

Title: The BPHZL renormalization of a planar quantum electrodynamics up to 2-loops and beyond
Authors: D.O.R. Azevedo, O.M. Del Cima, L.S. Lima, E.S. Miranda
Abstract: The renormalization of a parity-even massless $U(1)\times U(1)$ quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions (QED$_3$) is studied by adopting the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann-Lowenstein (BPHZL) renormalization method. The presence of two massless fermions requires the Lowenstein-Zimmermann (LZ) subtraction scheme to renormalize the infrared divergences induced by the ultraviolet subtractions at 1- and 2-loops, moreover due to the model superrenormalizability the ultraviolet divergences are bounded up to 2-loops. Finally, through the BPHZL renormalization method together with the LZ subtraction scheme the ultraviolet and infrared finiteness of the model is proved up to 2-loops and beyond.

Title: Picosecond Josephson Samplers: Modeling and Measurements
Authors: Logan Howe, Bart van Zeghbroeck, David Olaya, John Biesecker, Charles J. Burroughs, Samuel P. Benz, Peter F. Hopkins
Abstract: Measurement of signals generated by superconducting Josephson junction (JJ) circuits require ultra-fast components located in close proximity to the generating circuitry. We report a detailed study of optimal design criteria for a JJ-based sampler which balances the highest sampler bandwidth (shortest 10\%--90\% rise time) with minimal sampled waveform distortion. We explore the impacts on performance of a sampler, realized using a single underdamped JJ as the logical sampling element (the comparator), due to the type of signal-comparator coupling scheme that is utilized (galvanic, inductive, or capacitive). In these simulations we emulate the entire waveform reconstruction sampling process, via comparator threshold detection, while sweeping the time location at which the waveform is being sampled. We extract the sampled waveform rise time (or FWHM) as a function of the comparator's Stewart-McCumber parameter and as a function of the coupling strength between the device under test and comparator. Based on our simulation results we design, fabricate, and characterize a cryocooled (3.6 K operating temperature) JJ sampler utilizing the NIST state-of-the-art Nb/amorphous-Si/Nb junctions. We separately sample a step signal and impulse generator co-located on-chip with the comparator and sampling strobe generator by implementing the same binary search comparator threshold detection technique during sampler operation as is used in simulation. With this technique the system is fully-digital and automated and operation of the fabricated device directly mirrors simulation. Our sampler technology shows a 10\%--90\% rise time of 3.3 ps and the capability to measure transient pulse widths of 2.5 ps FWHM. A linear systems analysis of sampled waveforms indicate a 3 dB bandwidth of 225 GHz, but we demonstrate effective measurement of signals well above this -- as high as 600 GHz.

Title: The Many-Body Ground State Manifold of Flat Band Interacting Hamiltonian for Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Kevin D. Stubbs, Michael Ragone, Allan H. MacDonald, Lin Lin
Abstract: At a magic relative twist angle, magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has an octet of flat bands that can host strong correlation physics when partially filled. A key theoretical discovery in MATBG is the existence of ferromagnetic Slater determinants as exact ground states of the corresponding flat band interacting (FBI) Hamiltonian. The FBI Hamiltonian describes the behavior of electrons that interact with each other in a high-dimensional space, and is constructed from the band structure of the non-interacting Bistritzer--MacDonald model at the chiral limit. A key property of the FBI Hamiltonian for MATBG is that it is frustration free and can be written as a sum of non-commuting terms. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the ground state manifold of the FBI Hamiltonian, proving that it is precisely the linear span of such ferromagnetic Slater determinants.

Title: Drops on architected elastic substrates: A repertoire of regimes at the turn of a knob
Authors: Sergio Santos, Zakari Kujala, Sungyon Lee, Stefano Gonella
Abstract: Drops on a vibrating substrate can experience a variety of motion regimes, including directional motion and climbing. The key ingredient to elicit these regimes is simultaneously activating the in-plane and out-of-plane degrees of freedom of the substrate with the proper phase difference. This is typically achieved by using a rigid substrate and two independent actuators. However, this framework is unable to establish different motion conditions in different regions of the substrate, achieving spatial variability and selectivity, since this would violate the rigid-body assumption and require a proliferation of actuation channels. Challenging this paradigm, we leverage the inherent elasticity of the substrate to provide the modal and spatial diversity required to establish the desired regimes. To this end, we design deformable substrates exhibiting a rich landscape of deformation modes, and we exploit their multi-modal response to switch between drop motion regimes and select desired spatial patterns, using the excitation frequency as our tuning parameter.

Title: Quantum phase transitions in the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model
Authors: Hiroo Azuma, William J. Munro, Kae Nemoto
Abstract: We explore quantum phase transitions in the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model (JCHM). Using the mean-field approximation, we show that multiphoton JCHM reveals quantum phase transitions between the Mott insulator (MI), superfluid and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phases. The multiphoton JCHM MI phases are classified according to a conserved quantity associated with the total number of excited atoms and photons. If this conserved quantity diverges to infinity, this system is in the BEC phase. Exploring this system we observe the MI, BEC, and superfluid phases in both the single- and two-photon JCHMs although the two-photon JCHM MI phases are restricted to the small conserved quantity subspace. Contrastingly, only the superfluid and BEC phases arise in the three- and four-photon JCHMs (the MI phase is not observed).

Title: Transitions of the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement entropy in monitored quantum dynamics with homogeneous unitary gates
Authors: Ken Mochizuki, Ryusuke Hamazaki
Abstract: We explore the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement entropy in systems evolved by quantum measurements and spatially homogeneous unitary gates. In models with temporally random and Floquet unitary gates, we find that the Lyapunov exponents typically converge to values independent of measurement outcomes and that spectral transitions of the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement transitions of ground states occur at the same measurement thresholds. Our results indicate that (i) randomness due to quantum measurements is enough, or equivalently, randomness of unitary gates is not essential, for the typical convergence of the Lyapunov spectrum and that (ii) the correspondence between the spectral transition and entanglement transition is ubiquitous in a wide range of systems. We also discuss why the typical convergence occurs, in light of the uniqueness and positive definiteness of stationary states in the completely-positive trace-preserving (CPTP) dynamics averaged over random measurement outcomes.

Title: Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability
Authors: Hugo A. Camargo, Yichao Fu, Viktor Jahnke, Kuntal Pal, Keun-Young Kim
Abstract: A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.

Title: Energy transport in holographic non-conformal interfaces
Authors: Yan Liu, Chuan-Yi Wang, You-Jie Zeng
Abstract: We study energy transport in a system of two dimensional conformal field theories exchanging energy across a non-conformal interface involving a localised scalar operator, using holographic duality. By imposing the sourceless boundary condition, or equivalently, enforcing energy conservation at the interface, we show that the sum of the transmission and reflection coefficients is equal to one. Unlike conformal interfaces, we find that both the energy transmission and reflection coefficients are generally complex and frequency dependent. When the interface brane connects two distinct AdS$_2$ geometries, the transmission coefficient approaches the value expected for a conformal interface in the UV regime at high frequencies and in the IR regime at low frequencies. In the intermediate frequency range, the transmission coefficient may exhibit oscillatory behavior. Moreover, we present a nontrivial example of a fully transmissive interface, which exhibits similarities to a topological interface.

Title: 2D semiconductors as on-chip light sources for integrated nanophotonics
Authors: Christian Frydendahl, Torgom Yezekyan, Vladimir A. Zenin, Sergey I. Bozhevolnyi
Abstract: Incorporating on-chip light sources directly into nanophotonic waveguides generally requires introducing a different material to the chip than that used for guiding the light, a crucial step that requires dealing with several technical challenges, e.g., atomic lattice mismatch in epitaxial growth between substrate and luminescent materials resulting in strain defects that lower performance. Here we demonstrate that van der Waals materials, such as the 2D semiconductor MoSe2, can easily be transferred onto gold plasmonic nanowaveguides using standard dry visco-elastic polymer transfer techniques. We further show that the photoluminescence from MoSe2 can be injected directly into these on-chip waveguides. Our fabrication methods are compatible with large-scale roll-to-roll manufacturing techniques, highlighting a potential cost-effective and scalable hybrid plasmonic and 2D semiconductor platform for integrated nanophotonics.

Title: Charging free fermion quantum batteries
Authors: Riccardo Grazi, Fabio Cavaliere, Maura Sassetti, Dario Ferraro, Niccolò Traverso Ziani
Abstract: The performances of many-body quantum batteries strongly depend on the Hamiltonian of the battery, the initial state, and the charging protocol. In this article we derive an analytical expression for the energy stored via a double sudden quantum quench in a large class of quantum systems whose Hamiltonians can be reduced to 2x2 free fermion problems, whose initial state is thermal. Our results apply to conventional two-band electronic systems across all dimensions and quantum spin chains that can be solved through the Jordan-Wigner transformation. In particular, we apply our analytical relation to the quantum Ising chain, to the quantum XY chain, to the cluster Ising and to the long range SSH models. We obtain several results: (i) The strong dependence of the stored energy on the quantum phase diagram of the charging Hamiltonian persists even when the charging starts from a thermal state. Interestingly, in the thermodynamic limit, such a strong dependence manifests itself as non-analyticities of the stored energy corresponding to the quantum phase transition points of the charging Hamiltonian. (ii) The dependence of the stored energy on the parameters of the Hamiltonian can, in the Ising chain case, be drastically reduced by increasing temperature; (iii) Charging the Ising or the XY chain prepared in the ground state of their classical points leads to an amount of stored energy that, within a large parameter range, does not depend on the charging parameters; (iv) The cluster Ising model and the long range SSH model, despite showing quantum phase transitions (QPTs) between states with orders dominated by different interaction ranges, do not exhibit super-extensive, i.e. more than linear in the number of sites, scaling of the charging power.

Title: Enhancement of superconducting pairing via quantum control
Authors: Oleksandr Povitchan, Denys I. Bondar, Andrii G. Sotnikov
Abstract: We demonstrate that Lyapunov quantum control provides an effective strategy for enhancing superconducting correlations in the Fermi-Hubbard model without requiring careful parameter tuning. While photoinduced superconductivity is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of a monochromatic laser pulse, our approach employs a simple feedback-based protocol that prevents the decrease of superconducting correlations once they begin to form. This method enables robust enhancement of pairing across a broad range of initial pumping conditions, eliminating the need for intricate frequency and amplitude optimization. We also show that an alternative implementation, asymptotic quantum control, achieves comparable results. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to suppress previously induced superconducting correlations, providing bidirectional control over quantum pairing states. These findings suggest practical pathways for manipulating quantum correlations in strongly interacting systems with minimal experimental complexity.

Title: On the generalized Langevin equation and the Mori projection operator technique
Authors: Christoph Widder, Johannes Zimmer, Tanja Schilling
Abstract: In statistical physics, the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism (also called Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator formalism) is used to derive a linear integro-differential equation for observables in Hilbert space, the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). This technique relies on the splitting of the dynamics into a projected and an orthogonal part. We prove that the GLE together with the second fluctuation dissipation theorem (2FDT) uniquely define the fluctuating forces as well as the memory kernel. The GLE and 2FDT are an immediate consequence of the existence and uniqueness of solutions of linear Volterra equations. They neither rely on the Dyson identity nor on the concept of orthogonal dynamics. This holds true for autonomous as well as non-autonomous systems. Further results are obtained for the Mori projection for autonomous systems, for which the fluctuating forces are orthogonal to the observable of interest. In particular, we prove that the orthogonal dynamics is a strongly continuous semigroup generated by $\overline{\mathcal{QL}}Q$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the generator of the time evolution operator, and $\mathcal{P}=1-\mathcal{Q}$ is the Mori projection operator. As a consequence, the corresponding orbit maps (e.g.~the fluctuating forces) are the unique mild solutions of the associated abstract Cauchy problem. Furthermore, we show that the orthogonal dynamics is a unitary group, if $\mathcal{L}$ is skew-adjoint. In this case, the fluctuating forces are stationary. In addition, we present a proof of the GLE by means of semigroup theory, and we retrieve the commonly used definitions for the fluctuating forces, memory kernel, and orthogonal dynamics. Our results apply to general autonomous dynamical systems, whose time evolution is given by a strongly continuous semigroup. This includes large classes of systems in classical statistical mechanics.

Title: An Efficient scaled opposite-spin MP2 method for periodic systems
Authors: Idan Haritan, Xiao Wang, Tamar Goldzak
Abstract: We develop SOS-RILT-MP2, an efficient Gaussian-based periodic scaled opposite-spin second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (SOS-MP2) algorithm that utilizes the resolution-of-the-identity approximation (RI) combined with the Laplace transform technique (LT). In our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 157, 174112 (2022)], we showed that SOS-MP2 yields better predictions of the lattice constant, bulk modulus, and cohesive energy of 12 simple semiconductors and insulators compared to conventional MP2 and some of the leading density functionals. In this work, we present an efficient SOS-MP2 algorithm that has a scaling of O(N4) with the number of atoms N in the unit cell and a reduced scaling with the number of k-points in the Brillouin zone. We implemented and tested our algorithm on both molecular and solid-state systems, confirming the predicted scaling behavior by systematically increasing the number of atoms, the size of the basis set, and the density of k-point sampling. Using the benzene molecular crystal as a case study, we demonstrated that SOS-RILT-MP2 achieves significantly improved efficiency compared to conventional MP2. This efficient algorithm can be used in the future to study complex materials with large unit cells as well as defect structures.

Title: Load-dependent resistive-force theory for helical filaments
Authors: Pyae Hein Htet, Eric Lauga
Abstract: The passive rotation of rigid helical filaments is the propulsion strategy used by flagellated bacteria and some artificial microswimmers to navigate at low Reynolds numbers. In a classical 1976 paper, Lighthill calculated the `optimal' resistance coefficients in a local (logarithmically accurate) resistive-force theory that best approximates predictions from the nonlocal (algebraically accurate) slender-body theory for force-free swimming of a rotating helix without an attached load (e.g., no cell body). These coefficients have since been widely applied, often beyond the conditions for which they were originally derived. Here, we revisit the problem for the case where a load is attached to the rotating filament, such as the cell body of a bacterium or the head of an artificial swimmer. We show that the optimal resistance coefficients depend in fact on the size of the load, and we quantify the increasing inaccuracy of Lighthill's coefficients as the load grows. Finally, we provide a physical explanation for the origin of this unexpected load-dependence.

Title: Experimental Signatures for Identifying Distinct Origins of Color Field Generation
Authors: Subramanya Bhat K. N., Amita Das, Bhooshan Paradkar, V Ravishankar
Abstract: Signatures for non-abelian dynamics have long been central to QCD and QGP. Equally important are they in spin systems and laser-plasma interactions, where they emerge as effective interactions. Distinguishing experimentally gauge inequivalent sources (and hence potentials) that produce the same field tensor is one major task in this endeavour. As a step in this direction, this paper investigates how physically distinct sources which produce the same color electric field (uniform and constant) may be distinguished experimentally in a gauge-invariant manner. We first study the motion of a test particle in such fields and show that the resultant trajectories are counterintuitive. We then examine the radiation emitted - both gluonic and photonic and show that each source (independent non-abelian configuration) leaves a unique signature in the energy spectra, laying the ground for application to specific physical systems.

Title: Fast, Modular, and Differentiable Framework for Machine Learning-Enhanced Molecular Simulations
Authors: Henrik Christiansen, Takashi Maruyama, Federico Errica, Viktor Zaverkin, Makoto Takamoto, Francesco Alesiani
Abstract: We present an end-to-end differentiable molecular simulation framework (DIMOS) for molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. DIMOS easily integrates machine-learning-based interatomic potentials and implements classical force fields including particle-mesh Ewald electrostatics. Thanks to its modularity, both classical and machine-learning-based approaches can be easily combined into a hybrid description of the system (ML/MM). By supporting key molecular dynamics features such as efficient neighborlists and constraint algorithms for larger time steps, the framework bridges the gap between hand-optimized simulation engines and the flexibility of a PyTorch implementation. The superior performance and the high versatility is probed in different benchmarks and applications, with speed-up factors of up to $170\times$. The advantage of differentiability is demonstrated by an end-to-end optimization of the proposal distribution in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Using these optimized simulation parameters a $3\times$ acceleration is observed in comparison to ad-hoc chosen simulation parameters. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Multiparticle Collision Dynamics Simulations of the Flagellar Apparatus in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
Authors: Sai Venkata Ramana Ambadipudi, Azam Gholami
Abstract: We investigate the swimming dynamics, orientational behavior, and hydrodynamic interactions of the flagellar apparatus (FA) of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD) simulations. Extending the model established in Yang et al., we simulate the FA as a chain of monomers connected by elastic springs. Our simulations reveal that an FA with a nonzero mean curvature in its flagellar beat pattern exhibits sustained ballistic motion for several hundred beats before crossing over to a diffusion-dominated regime due to rotational diffusion. In contrast, $FA_0$, a flagellar apparatus consisting of two flagella with zero average curvature positioned head-to-head, fails to achieve net propulsion due to its mirror-symmetric deformations, confirming that non-reciprocal shape deformation is necessary but not sufficient condition for propulsion. The orientational auto-correlation function (OACF) of FA decays exponentially, aligning with that of an inactive FA, while the OACF of $FA_0$ also follows an exponential decay, similar to an inactive $FA_0$. These findings indicate that active beating does not influence the rotational diffusion of the flagellar apparatus. Additionally, simulations of an asymmetric FA, where the arms beat at different frequencies, corroborate experimental observations, revealing a helical swimming trajectory. When two FAs swim along the same axis in close proximity, they form stable pairs, leading to enhanced swimming speeds. Conversely, head-on encounters result in mutual blocking, preventing any net displacement. These findings provide valuable insights into the collective behavior of microswimmers and their hydrodynamic interactions in low Reynolds number environments.

Title: Length-flexible strategies for efficient SERS performance in gold-nanorod-gapped nanoantennas
Authors: Sergio F. Flores-Correa, M. L. León Hilario, I. A. Ramos-Pérez, Andres A. Reynoso
Abstract: Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) using gold-nanorod-dimer nanoantennas has shown great potential in various applications. This reflects in their large values of the customary figure of merit of SERS: the enhancement factor (EF), which is essentially the fourth power of the electric field integrated at the gap, the location at which target molecules are to be sensed. However, fabrication errors in the nanorod lengths can lead to significant variations in the enhancement factor, resulting in performance limitations whenever low values of EF are encountered. Here, we report both design and procedural strategies to address this issue. First, we show that by reducing the nanorod diameter from 360 nm to 260 nm, the EF minima can be avoided for any nanorod length, mitigating the impact of fabrication errors. In addition, we explore the influence of incident wave polarization and orientation on the EF. Our simulations reveal that by tilting the excitation away from normal incidence, it is possible to substantially enhance EF under conditions that would otherwise exhibit low enhancement. In particular, this includes the case of 360 nm diameter. These findings expand the fabrication tolerance and broaden the range of usability of gold-nanorod-dimer nanoantennas, enabling more robust and reliable SERS performance. Importantly, we also show that these strategies also apply to nanoantennas with covered nanorod ends, which are of particular interest for realizing hybrid devices that combine SERS with electrical transport measurements.

Title: Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer
Authors: Jun Nishimura, Hiromasa Watanabe
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.

Title: Orbital optimization of large active spaces via AI-accelerators
Authors: Örs Legeza, Andor Menczer, Ádám Ganyecz, Miklós Antal Werner, Kornél Kapás, Jeff Hammond, Sotiris S. Xantheas, Martin Ganahl, Frank Neese
Abstract: We present an efficient orbital optimization procedure that combines the highly GPU accelerated, spin-adapted density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with the complete active space self-consistent field (CAS-SCF) approach for quantum chemistry implemented in the ORCA program package. Leveraging the computational power of the latest generation of Nvidia GPU hardware, we perform CAS-SCF based orbital optimizations for unprecedented CAS sizes of up to 82 electrons in 82 orbitals [CAS(82,82)] in molecular systems comprising of active spaces sizes of hundreds of electrons in thousands of orbitals. For both the NVIDIA DGX-A100 and DGX-H100 hardware, we provide a detailed scaling and error analysis of our DMRG-SCF approach for benchmark systems consisting of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and iron-sulfur complexes of varying sizes. Our efforts demonstrate for the first time that highly accurate DMRG calculations at large bond dimensions are critical for obtaining reliably converged CAS-SCF energies. For the more challenging iron-sulfur benchmark systems, we furthermore find the optimized orbitals of a converged CAS-SCF calculation to depend more sensitively on the DMRG parameters than those for the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The ability to obtain converged CAS-SCF energies and orbitals for active spaces of such large sizes within days reduces the challenges of including the appropriate orbitals into the CAS or selecting the correct minimal CAS, and may open up entirely new avenues for tackling strongly correlated molecular systems.

Title: Boundary Time Crystals Induced by Local Dissipation and Long-Range Interactions
Authors: Zhuqing Wang, Ruochen Gao, Xiaoling Wu, Berislav Buča, Klaus Mølmer, Li You, Fan Yang
Abstract: Driven-dissipative many-body system supports nontrivial quantum phases absent in equilibrium. As a prominent example, the interplay between coherent driving and collective dissipation can lead to a dynamical quantum phase that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry. This so-called boundary time crystal (BTC) is fragile in the presence of local dissipation, which inevitably relaxes the system to a stationary state. In this work, we demonstrate a robust BTC that is intrinsically induced by local dissipation. We provide extensive numerical evidences to support existence of the BTC and study its behaviors in different regimes. In particular, with decreasing interaction range, we identify a transition from classical limit cycles to quantum BTCs featuring sizable spatial correlations. Our studies significantly broaden the scope of nonequilibrium phases and shed new light on experimental search for dynamical quantum matter.

Title: Pair density wave solution for a self-consistent model
Authors: S. I. Matveenko, S. I. Mukhin
Abstract: In the self-consistent approximation for the two-dimensional mean-field model we found an analytic solution for the ground state with a coexisting d-wave symmetric bond ordered pair density wave (PDW) and spin (SDW) or charge (CDW) density waves, as observed in some high-temperature superconductors. In particular, the solution gives the same periodicity for CDW and PDW, and a pseudogap in the Fermi-excitation spectrum.

Title: Layer-dependent spin-resolved electronic structure of ferromagnetic triple-layered ruthenate Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$
Authors: Prosper Ngabonziza, Jonathan D. Denlinger, Alexei V. Fedorov, Gang Cao, J. W. Allen, G. Gebreyesus, Richard M. Martin
Abstract: High-resolution angle- and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of the triple-layered ruthenate Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$ reveals features of the electronic structure that extend our understanding of the layered strontium ruthenates. The spectra near the Fermi energy are very different from the non-magnetic analogues Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ with distinct Fermi surfaces for wide electron-like minority spin bands around the zone center and narrow hole-like majority spin Fermi surface contours around the zone corners. The most dramatic results are two narrow spectral peaks $\sim$30 meV below the Fermi-level, a spin-minority hole-like band at the Brillouin zone center, and a spin-majority saddle-band van Hove singularity at the zone edge, which exhibits almost 100\% spin-polarization at low temperature, and a strong temperature dependent coherence-incoherence crossover attributed to Hund metal correlations. Quantitative comparison of the ARPES to spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations identify the specific antibonding and nonbonding orbital origins of the narrow bands, with a prediction of different spatial localization in the central and outer layers. This is shown to be consistent with experimental ARPES multi-zone matrix element intensity variations, and implicates outer-layer-specific control of the in-plane metamagnetism. The renormalization of the bands relative to the mean-field DFT, the demonstration of spin-polarized oxygen bands, and of spin-minority and spin-majority band-crossing hybridization, provide a more complete picture of the magnetism which displays aspects of both delocalized and local moment behavior.

Title: Stabilizing the calculation of the self-energy in dynamical mean-field theory using constrained residual minimization
Authors: Harrison LaBollita, Jason Kaye, Alexander Hampel
Abstract: We propose a simple and efficient method to calculate the electronic self-energy in dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), addressing a numerical instability often encountered when solving the Dyson equation. Our approach formulates the Dyson equation as a constrained optimization problem with a simple quadratic objective. The constraints on the self-energy are obtained via direct measurement of the leading order terms of its asymptotic expansion within a continuous time quantum Monte Carlo framework, and the use of the compact discrete Lehmann representation of the self-energy yields an optimization problem in a modest number of unknowns. We benchmark our method for the non-interacting Bethe lattice, as well as DMFT calculations for both model systems and ab-initio applications.

Title: Matrix product state fixed points of non-Hermitian transfer matrices
Authors: Wei Tang, Frank Verstraete, Jutho Haegeman
Abstract: The contraction of tensor networks is a central task in the application of tensor network methods to the study of quantum and classical many body systems. In this paper, we investigate the impact of gauge degrees of freedom in the virtual indices of the tensor network on the contraction process, specifically focusing on boundary matrix product state methods for contracting two-dimensional tensor networks. We show that the gauge transformation can affect the entanglement structures of the eigenstates of the transfer matrix and change how the physical information is encoded in the eigenstates, which can influence the accuracy of the numerical simulation. We demonstrate this effect by looking at two different examples. First, we focus on the local gauge transformation, and analyze its effect by viewing it as an imaginary-time evolution governed by a diagonal Hamiltonian. As a specific example, we perform a numerical analysis in the classical Ising model on the square lattice. Second, we go beyond the scope of local gauge transformations and study the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the triangular lattice. The partition function of this model has two tensor network representations connected by a non-local gauge transformation, resulting in distinct numerical performances in the boundary matrix product state calculation.

Title: Stochastic heat differences between many-particle and density field descriptions
Authors: Takuya Saito, Yutaka Sumino
Abstract: This article investigates spatiotemporally discrete or continuous stochastic descriptions, where we focus on differences in heat naturally defined between the particle level and the density field. Both the descriptions are found to generally make the heat differences by the entropic term expressed just with the number density through spatial projection from the many particles' positions onto the density field. The transformation from the Langevin to Dean--Kawasaki equations is considered as the projection in the continuous descriptions, where the emergent heat differences undergo little temporal variations due to the sparse distributions of the point-particles. On the other hand, the analogous formalisms constructed in the discrete models may exhibit the explicit temporal evolutions of the entropic term. Furthermore, we develop arguments about the interpretation and applicability of the heat differences as well as the perspectives to many-polymer system.

Title: Electrical control of a Kondo spin screening cloud
Authors: Ngoc Han Tu, Donghoon Kim, Minsoo L. Kim, Jeongmin Shim, Ryo Ito, David Pomaranski, Ivan V. Borzenets, Arne Ludwig, Andreas D. Wieck, Heung-Sun Sim, Michihisa Yamamoto
Abstract: Quantitative analysis of quantum many-body systems, consisting of numerous itinerant electrons that interact with localized spins or electrons, is a long-standing issue. The Kondo cloud, a quantum many-body object of conduction electrons that screens a single localized spin, is the building block of such strongly correlated electronic systems. While quantitative analysis of the Kondo cloud associated with a single magnetic impurity is well established for uniform conduction electrons, the fundamental properties of a deformed Kondo cloud influenced by conduction electrons with a modulated density of states remain unsolved. Here we report engineering of the Kondo cloud deformation by confining a part of the cloud into a quantum box called the Kondo box that mimics realistic material systems. We demonstrate quantitative control of the Kondo cloud by developing a way of tuning quantum interference in the box and monitoring the Kondo entanglement. The temperature dependence of the entanglement reveals counterintuitively that the cloud shape is altered mainly outside the box although the quantum interference in the box is tuned. Our work provides a way to simulate various strongly correlated systems by integrating the Kondo cloud, which is not possible in the current theoretical framework.

Title: The quantum Mpemba effect in free-fermionic mixed states
Authors: Filiberto Ares, Vittorio Vitale, Sara Murciano
Abstract: Recently, a novel probe to study symmetry breaking, known as entanglement asymmetry, has emerged and has been utilized to explore how symmetry is dynamically restored following quantum quenches. Interestingly, it has been shown that, in certain scenarios, greater initial symmetry breaking leads to faster restoration, akin to a quantum Mpemba effect. This study focuses on investigating the effect of mixed initial states and non-unitary dynamics on symmetry restoration. The mixedness of a state can arise from different sources. We consider dephasing or dissipative processes affecting initial pure states or unitary dynamics of initially thermal states. In the former case, the stationary state after the quench is independent of the initial configuration, resembling the phenomenology of the classical Mpemba effect. Investigating the XY spin chain model, through a combination of analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we identify the conditions for the occurrence of the quantum Mpemba effect. It turns out that this phenomenon still occurs in the presence of dissipation or at finite temperature, even though it will be eventually suppressed as the state becomes more mixed.

Title: Exact results, transient generalized Gibbs ensembles, and analytic approximations for spacetime propagators of massive, real scalar fields in one spatial dimension
Authors: Tobias Boorman, Bernd Braunecker
Abstract: The massive, real scalar field described by the Klein-Gordon equation in one spatial dimension is the most elementary example of a bosonic quantum field theory. It has been investigated for many decades either as a simple academic theory or as a realistic emergent many-body theory in low-dimensional systems. Despite this, the space and time behavior of its propagators have rarely been in the foreground, and although exact results are known, there remain gaps in the description and a lack of an in-depth physical analysis. The aim of this paper is to address the deficits by providing a comprehensive discussion of the results, and to show that this old theory still allows for several new results and insights. To start, we review the known results by providing a rederivation in full detail, to which we add a discussion on how exactly space and time variables need to be extended to complex values to ensure analyticity throughout spacetime. This procedure shows also how singularities on the lightcone need to be regularized to remain compatible with the analyticity and the physical limit of a vanishing mass. An extension to nonzero temperatures is provided by considering the contact of the field to a nonrelativistic thermal reservoir, such as is necessary for emerging field theories in condensed matter systems. Subsequently, it is shown that the transient, short spacetime propagation can be understood in the context of the modern development of a generalized Gibbs ensemble, which describes a massless theory with an effective temperature that is set by the Klein-Gordon mass and the physical temperature. Finally, an approximation scheme is presented that captures the non-trivial mass dependence of the propagators throughout all spacetime but involves only elementary functions.

Title: Review and Prospect of Algebraic Research in Equivalent Framework between Statistical Mechanics and Machine Learning Theory
Authors: Sumio Watanabe
Abstract: Mathematical equivalence between statistical mechanics and machine learning theory has been known since the 20th century, and research based on this equivalence has provided novel methodologies in both theoretical physics and statistical learning theory. It is well known that algebraic approaches in statistical mechanics such as operator algebra enable us to analyze phase transition phenomena mathematically. In this paper, we review and prospect algebraic research in machine learning theory for theoretical physicists who are interested in artificial intelligence. If a learning machine has a hierarchical structure or latent variables, then the random Hamiltonian cannot be expressed by any quadratic perturbation because it has singularities. To study an equilibrium state defined by such a singular random Hamiltonian, algebraic approaches are necessary to derive the asymptotic form of the free energy and the generalization error. We also introduce the most recent advance: the theoretical foundation for the alignment of artificial intelligence is now being constructed based on algebraic learning theory. This paper is devoted to the memory of Professor Huzihiro Araki who is a pioneering founder of algebraic research in both statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.

Title: Tunable Fano and Dicke effects in quantum transport of double quantum dots sandwiched between topological insulators
Authors: Yuan Hong, Zhen-Guo Fu, Zhou-Wei-Yu Chen, Feng Chi, Zhigang Wang, Wei Zhang, Ping Zhang
Abstract: We study the quantum transport in double quantum dots (DQD) sandwiched between surfaces of topological insulator (TI) Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$, which possess strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and $^{d}$C$_{3v}$ double group symmetry. Different from the spin-conserved case with two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) electrodes, the conductance displays a universal scaling relation for different Fermi energy associated with the topological nature/linear dispersion of topological surface states. The interplay between direct inter-dot tunneling and surface state mediated interaction leads to tunable Dicke and Fano effects with changing the inter-dot distance. We propose nano-rulers with different measurement range and resolution based on the Fano $q$-factor. Furthermore, when applying an in-plane Zeeman field, a crossover from a double-peak shape to a quad-peak shape in conductance curve appears. Moreover, the rotational symmetry of the system could also be revealed from the conductance pattern. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the quantum transport in the presence of electrode's SOC topological states.

Title: Seasonal footprints on ecological time series and jumps in dynamic states of protein configurations from a non-linear forecasting method characterization
Authors: Leonardo Reyes, Kilver Campos, Douglas Avendaño, Lenin González-Paz, Alejandro Vivas, Ysaías J. Alvarado, Saúl Flores
Abstract: We have analyzed phenology data and protein configurations from molecular dynamics simulations with the nonlinear forecasting method proposed by May and Sugihara. Our primary focus in this work is to characterize the dynamic state of a system by quantifying prediction quality from data. Full plots of prediction quality as a function of dimensionality $E$ and forecasting time $T_p$, the two basic parameters of the method, give fast and valuable information about Complex Systems dynamics. We detect changes in protein dynamics due to mutations and, regarding ecology data, we show how cycles and {\it rhythms} of the environment manifests in parameter space $(E,T_p)$ for some species.

Title: Application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems
Authors: Projesh Kumar Roy
Abstract: This letter investigates the application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems. A modified statistical correlation theory has been proposed by including non-linearity in the form of an exponent into the original theory of Haldane. The dependence of the statistical correlation on indistinguishability is highlighted. Using this modified theory, a quasi-classical derivation of intermediate statistics is shown where indistinguishability can be introduced into distinguishable systems in the form of a statistical correlation. The final result is equivalent to the classical fractional exclusion statistics (CFES), which was derived earlier using a purely classical route. An extended non-linear correlation model based on power series expansion is also proposed, which can produce various intermediate statistical models.

Abstract: The complexation of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) and thermoresponsive microgels is widely exploited for applications, but a microscopic description of the mechanisms governing the spatial organization of the NPs is still lacking. Combining small angle X-ray scattering, state-of-the-art simulations and a simple toy model, we uncover how the volume phase transition of microgels controls NP-NP interactions, establishing for the first time a microscopic link between plasmon coupling and NP local structure. Our study paves the way to experimentally investigate phase transitions on controlled curved surfaces at the nanoscale.

Title: Generalized hydrodynamics of integrable quantum circuits
Authors: Friedrich Hübner, Eric Vernier, Lorenzo Piroli
Abstract: Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.

Title: Entanglement Witness for Indistinguishable Electrons using Solid-State Spectroscopy
Authors: Tongtong Liu, Luogen Xu, Jiarui Liu, Yao Wang
Abstract: Characterizing entanglement in quantum materials is crucial for advancing next-generation quantum technologies. Despite recent strides in witnessing entanglement in magnetic materials with distinguishable spin modes, quantifying entanglement in systems formed by indistinguishable electrons remains a formidable challenge. To solve this problem, we introduce a method to extract various four-fermion correlations by analyzing the nonlinearity in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra. These correlations constitute the primary components of the cumulant two-particle reduced density matrix. We further derive bounds for its eigenvalues and demonstrate the linear scaling with fermionic entanglement depth, providing a reliable witness for entanglement. Using the material-relevant strongly correlated models as examples, we show how this entanglement witness can efficiently quantify multipartite entanglement across different phase regions, highlighting its advantage over quantum Fisher information.

Title: Single vanadium ion magnetic dopant in an individual CdTe/ZnTe quantum dot
Authors: Karolina Ewa Połczyńska, Tomasz Kazimierczuk, Piotr Kossacki, Wojciech Pacuski
Abstract: We present the basic properties of a new physical system: an individual V2+ ion embedded into an individual quantum dot. The system is realized utilizing molecular beam epitaxy and it is observed using a low-temperature polarization-resolved magneto-photoluminescence. The nature of the system is confirmed by observation of the excitonic lines split due to the interactions of a vanadium ion with carriers confined in a CdTe/ZnTe quantum dot. Observed data are explained by the numerical modeling which includes s,p-d exchange interaction, Zeeman splitting of the exciton and the ion, diamagnetic shift, and the presence of shear strain within the quantum dot. The fundamental state of vanadium exhibits a spin +/- 1/2 making this system a textbook localized qubit.

Title: Diminished quantum depletion and correlated droplets in one-dimensional dipolar Bose gas
Authors: B. Tüzemen, M. Marciniak, K. Pawłowski
Abstract: We investigate the formation of self-bound states in a one-dimensional dipolar Bose gas under the influence of both strong short-range repulsive and strong non-local attractive interactions. While conventional methods like the Bogoliubov de-Gennes (BdG) method typically fail in regimes with strong interactions due to significant quantum depletion, we reveal a particular scenario where the interplay of these strong interactions significantly mitigates quantum depletion, thus restoring the applicability of the BdG method. Remarkably, this restoration occurs even though the system exhibits pronounced anti-bunching, a feature usually linked with strongly correlated systems. By comparing our BdG results with exact ab initio calculations, we confirm the accuracy of the BdG approach in predicting the ground-state energy and correlation functions under these conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adjusting the polarization direction of the dipoles allows for a tunable transition between a strongly interacting regime and the novel balanced regime explored in this research.

Title: Non-linear correlations underlie linear response and causality
Authors: Gabriele Di Antonio, Gianni Valerio Vinci
Abstract: The inference of causal relationships among observed variables is a pivotal, longstanding problem in the scientific community. An intuitive method for quantifying these causal links involves examining the response of one variable to perturbations in another. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem elegantly connects this response to the correlation functions of the unperturbed system, thereby bridging the concepts of causality and correlation. However, this relationship becomes intricate in nonlinear systems, where knowledge of the invariant measure is required but elusive, especially in high-dimensional spaces. In this study, we establish a novel link between the Koopman operator of nonlinear stochastic systems and the response function. This connection provides an alternative method for computing the response function using generalized correlation functions, even when the invariant measure is unknown. We validate our theoretical framework by applying it to a nonlinear high-dimensional system amenable to exact solutions, demonstrating convergence and consistency with established results. Finally, we discuss a significant interplay between the resulting causal network and the relevant time scales of the system.

Title: Correlated proton disorder in the crystal structure of the double hydroxide perovskite CuSn(OH)$_6$
Authors: Anton A. Kulbakov, Ellen Häußler, Kaushick K. Parui, Aswathi Mannathanath Chakkingal, Nikolai S. Pavlovskii, Vladimir Yu. Pomjakushin, Laura Cañadillas-Delgado, Thomas Hansen, Darren C. Peets, Thomas Doert, Dmytro S. Inosov
Abstract: CuSn(OH)$_6$ is a quantum spin system from the family of magnetic double perovskite hydroxides, having a frustrated magnetic sublattice. It is also known as the natural mineral mushistonite, whose crystal structure has remained elusive for decades. Here we employ x-ray and neutron powder diffraction to solve the crystal structure of CuSn(OH)$_6$ and propose a structure model in the orthorhombic space group $Pnnn$ with correlated proton disorder. The occupation of the hydrogen sites in the structure is constrained by ``ice rules'' similar to those known for water ice. The resulting frustration of the hydrogen bonding network is likely to have a complex and interesting interplay with the strong magnetic frustration expected in the face-centred magnetic sublattice. Structural distortions, which are quite pronounced in Cu$^{2+}$ compounds due to the Jahn-Teller effect, partially alleviate both types of frustration. We also show that hydrostatic pressure tends to suppress proton disorder through a sequence of proton-ordering transitions, as some of the split hydrogen sites merge already at 1.75 GPa while others show a tendency toward possible merging at higher pressures.

Title: Vortex phases and domain walls in trapped spinor Bose-Einstein condensates with inhomogeneous spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling
Authors: O. O. Prykhodko, L. V. Zadorozhna
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state structures and vortex configurations in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) under the influence of spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling (SOAMC) with a high spatial inhomogeneity and high characteristic orbital angular momentum. By modulating the coupling strength, we uncover two distinct quantum phases: a stripe phase at low coupling strengths and a new vortex-necklace phase at higher coupling intensities. The latter is characterized by vortices forming a ring-shaped structure that acts as a domain wall, a unique phase boundary between a central stripe phase and an outer single-momentum phase. For a better understanding of this new mixed phase of the system, we develop an analytical model to describe the domain wall radius as a function of coupling strength, which aligns well with numerical simulations. Our findings contribute to the understanding of SOAMC-driven quantum phase transitions and domain wall formation, offering new insights into topological phenomena in ultracold atomic systems.

Abstract: We report the observation of a light-induced subpicosecond phase transition in the antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetal EuAgAs, achieved through ultrafast optical excitation. Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we probe the nonequilibrium carrier dynamics, discovering distinct fluence-dependent responses in the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic states, and revealing a possible magnetic order-driven transition between different topological states. Our results demonstrate that EuAgAs, with its highly tunable magnetic structure, possibly offers a unique platform for exploring topological phase transitions. These results underscore the potential of ultrashort optical pulses as powerful tools for the real-time control of topological phases, opening pathways for advances in spintronics, quantum computing, and energy-efficient information technologies.

Title: Electronic structure of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates: strain to mimic the effects pressure
Authors: Yi-Feng Zhao, Antia S. Botana
Abstract: Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have recently been reported in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates with general chemical formula La$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n=$ number of perovskite layers along the $c$-axis). The emergence of superconductivity is always concomitant with a structural transition in which the octahedral tilts are suppressed, bringing the apical Ni-O-Ni angle to 180$^\circ$ and causing an increase in the out-of-plane $d_{z^2}$ orbital overlap. Due to this strong interlayer coupling, a flat band of pure $d_{z^2}$ character crosses the Fermi level. Here, using first-principles calculations, we explore biaxial strain (both compressive and tensile) as a means to mimic the electronic structure characteristics of RP nickelates (up to $n=5$) under hydrostatic pressure. Our findings highlight that strain allows to decouple the structural and electronic structure effects obtained under hydrostatic pressure: while compressive strain brings the apical Ni-O-Ni angle closer to 180$^\circ$, it shifts the $d_{z^2}$ flat bands away from the Fermi energy, giving rise to a more cuprate-like electronic structure. In contrast, tensile strain reduces the apical Ni-O-Ni angle (to values $\sim$ 160$^\circ$), but it recovers the flat $d_{z^2}$ band at the Fermi level appearing in the bilayer and trilayer RPs under pressure. Overall, strain represents a promising way to tune the electronic structure of RP nickelates and could be an alternative route to achieve superconductivity at ambient pressure in this family of materials.

Title: Isotopic separation in mixed clusters of molecular hydrogen
Authors: Kiril M. Kolevski, Jie-Ru Hu, Massimo Boninsegni
Abstract: We investigate mixed (50/50) clusters of parahydrogen and orthodeuterium at low temperature, by means of Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our results provide evidence of liquid-like behavior and partial isotopic separation in a cluster of 640 molecules, at temperature T=10 K. As the temperature is lowered below ~ 6 K, crystallization occurs, with no indication that the liquid phase is more resilient at low temperature in a mixed cluster. Isotopic separation is therefore predicted to take place at low temperature only through the slow process of molecular self-diffusion in a crystalline matrix.

Title: Equatorial deformation of homogeneous spherical fluid vesicles by a rigid ring
Authors: Pablo Vázquez-Montejo, Bojan Božič, Jemal Guven
Abstract: We examine the deformation of homogeneous spherical fluid vesicles along their equator by a circular rigid ring. We consider deformations preserving the axial and equatorial mirror symmetries of the vesicles. The configurations of the vesicle are determined employing the spontaneous curvature model subject to the constraints imposed by the ring as well as of having constant area or volume. We determine two expressions of the force exerted by the ring, one involving a discontinuity in the derivative of the curvature of the membrane across the ring, and another one in terms of the global quantities of the vesicle. For small enough values of the spontaneous curvature there is only one sequence of configurations for either fixed area or volume. The behavior of constricted vesicles is similar for both constraints, they follow a transition from prolate to dumbbell shapes, which culminates in two quasispherical vesicles connected by a small catenoid-like neck. We analyze the geometry and the force of the small neck employing a perturbative analysis about the catenoid. A stretched vesicle initially adopts an oblate shape for either constraint. If the area is fixed the vesicle increasingly flattens until it attains a disclike shape, which we examine using an asymptotic analysis. If the volume is fixed the poles approach until they touch and the vesicle adopts a discocyte shape. When the spontaneous curvature of the vesicle is close to the mean curvature of the constricted quasispherical vesicles, the sequences of configurations of both constraints develop bifurcations, and some of the configurations corresponding to one of their branches have the lowest energy.

Title: Dynamics and lifetime of geometric excitations in moiré systems
Authors: Yuzhu Wang, Joe Huxford, Dung Xuan Nguyen, Guangyue Ji, Yong Baek Kim, Bo Yang
Abstract: We show that spin-2 geometric excitations, known as graviton modes, generally exhibit vanishing lifetimes in lattice Chern bands, including in moiré systems. In contrast to the Landau levels, we first numerically demonstrate that the prominent graviton peaks in spectral functions diminish rapidly with increasing system sizes. We explore how the choice of interaction affects the strength of these peaks, with short-ranged interactions pushing the graviton mode far into the continuum of excitations, where it can be significantly scattered due to the increased density of states. We also analytically investigate the short lifetime of the graviton mode. In lattice systems, continuous rotational symmetry is broken, leading to highly anisotropic gapped excitations that mix different angular momentum or ``spins''. This is despite the surprising emergence of a ``guiding center" continuous rotational symmetry in the ground state, which is shared by the graviton mode. Consequently, the graviton mode in Chern bands can be strongly scattered by the anisotropic gapped excitations. However, the emergent rotational symmetry implies that gravitons can be robust in principle, and we propose experimental tuning strategies to lower the graviton mode energy below the continuum. We argue this is a necessary condition enabling the observation of graviton modes and geometric excitations in realistic moiré systems.

Title: The effect of Carrier Doping and Thickness on the Electronic Structures of La$3$Ni$2$O$7$ Thin Films
Authors: Haoliang Shi, Zihao Huo, Guanlin Li, Hao Ma, Tian Cui, Dao-Xin Yao, Defang Duan
Abstract: Recently, the superconductivity of bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has been observed in the thin film at ambient pressure, facilitated by epitaxial strain. Here, we investigate the effects of film thickness and carrier doping on the electronic structure of La3Ni2O7 thin films with thickness of 0.5-3 unit cells (UC) using first-principles calculations. At an optimal doping concentration of 0.4 holes per formula unit for 2UC film, the Ni-"d" _("z" ^"2" ) interlayer bonding state metallizes, leading to the formation of {\gamma} pockets at the Fermi surface, which quantitatively matches the experimental results of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). These findings provide theoretical support for recent experimental observations of ambient-pressure superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 thin films and highlight the crucial role of film thickness and carrier doping in modulating electronic properties.

Title: Probing Mixed Valence States by Nuclear Spin-Spin Relaxation Time Measurements
Authors: Yoshihiko Ihara, Masakazu Shimohashi, Markus Kriener
Abstract: Several elements in the periodic table exhibit an interesting and often overlooked feature: They skip certain valence states which is discussed in the field of superconductivity to be in favor of fostering higher transition temperatures $T_c$. However, from the experimental point of view, it is often deemed difficult to probe changes in the valence state. Here we demonstrate that the latter are accessible by the spin-spin relaxation rate $1/T_2$ in nuclear magnetic resonance. As target material, we chose the solid solution Ge$_{1-x}$In$_x$Te, where valence-skipping In induces superconductivity and changes its valence state as a function of $x$. We observe a strong enhancement in $1/T_2(x)$ and, most importantly, find that $1/T_2$ and $T_c$ exhibit a strikingly similar $x$ dependence. These results underline the importance of valence physics for the evolution of superconductivity in Ge$_{1-x}$In$_x$Te. A model based on a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida type of interaction among the In nuclei is proposed which fully accounts for the experimental results.

Title: Spectral properties of disordered insulating lattice under nonlinear electric field
Authors: Kunal Mozumdar, Herbert F. Fotso, Jong E. Han (University at Buffalo, SUNY, Buffalo, NY)
Abstract: Quenched disorder in a solid state system can result in Anderson localization where electrons are exponentially localized and the system behaves like an insulator. In this study, we investigate the effect of a DC electric field on Anderson localization. The study highlights the case of a one-dimensional insulator chain with on-site disorder when a DC electric field is applied throughout the chain. We study spectral properties of an Anderson localized system in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium using a full lattice nonequilibrium Green's function method in the steady-state limit. Tuning the disorder and the electric field strength results in the creation of exponential Lifshitz tails near the band edge by strongly localized levels. These Lifshtiz tails create effects like insulator-to-metal transitions and contribute to non-local hopping. The electric field causes gradual delocalization of the system and Anderson localization crossing over to Wannier Stark ladders at very strong fields. Our study makes a comparison with the coherent potential approximation (CPA) highlighting some major differences and similarities in the physics of disorder.

Title: Time-domain identification of distinct mechanisms for competing charge density waves in a rare-earth tritelluride

Abstract: Understanding the origin of phase transitions and the interactions between distinct phases remains a central task in condensed matter physics. Charge density wave (CDW) systems provide an ideal platform for investigating these phenomena. While the dominant CDW phases in many materials can be explained through Fermi surface nesting or electron-phonon interactions, certain CDW phase transitions remain poorly understood, challenging conventional paradigms. One notable example is rare-earth tritelluride ErTe3, which hosts two competing CDW orders. While the dominant CDW phase fits within the electron-phonon coupling framework, the formation mechanism of the subdominant CDW remains enigmatic. In this study, we combine time-and-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) with time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) theory to establish a time-domain approach for probing phase transitions in solid-state systems. By analyzing the distinct recovery dynamics of the two CDW orders in ErTe3 following light excitation, we reveal a novel nucleation-like growth mechanism that likely drives the secondary CDW phase transition. This work not only uncovers a previously unknown CDW formation mechanism in rare-earth tritellurides but also introduces a non-equilibrium framework for understanding phase transitions and phase competition in quantum materials.

Title: Structural, electronic, vibrational, optical, piezoelectric, thermal and thermoelectric properties of BCZT from first-principles calculations
Authors: Debidutta Pradhan, Jagadish Kumar
Abstract: Perovskite material such as BCZT (Ba$_{0.875}$Ca$_{0.125}$(Zr$_{0.125}$Ti$_{0.875}$)O$_{3}$) is well known for its high value of piezoceramic properties and Curie temperature which has potential applications in sensors, actuators, optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices. Based on its composition and physical parameters such as pressure and temperature, experimentally, BCZT shows different crystal structures (rhombohedral, tetragonal and orthorhombic) with multiferroic properties. Here, we have designed these materials by comparing experimental stoichiometry and evaluated their stability by calculating the tolerance factor, formation energy, and cohesive energy. The structural, electronic and vibrational properties of BCZT are explored using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within the framework of density functional theory. We have also shown variation of piezoelectric and optical properties through multiple phases using time dependent density functional theory. The electronic band gap, optical response in the visible light range, as well as piezoelectric, electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric properties, demonstrate excellent characteristics, making this material a promising lead-free ferroelectric candidate for various energy harvesting applications. Boltzmann transport theory is used for the calculation of Seebeck coefficient, electron thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity to estimate the power factor and figure of merit which represents the efficiency of the material. The high values at the Fermi level suggest that these materials are well-suited for future device applications.

Title: Theory of Two-level Tunneling Systems in Superconductors
Authors: Junguang He, Wei-Ting Lin, J. A. Sauls
Abstract: We develop a field theory formulation for the interaction of an ensemble of two-level tunneling systems (TLS) with the electronic states of a superconductor. Predictions for the impact of two-level tunneling systems on superconductivity are presented, including $T_c$ and spectrum of quasiparticle states for conventional BCS superconductors. We show that non-magnetic TLS impurities in conventional s-wave superconductors can act as pair-breaking or pair-enhancing defects depending on the level population of the distribution of TLS impurities. We present calculations of the enhancement of superconductivity, both $T_c$ and the order parameter, for TLS defects in thermal equilibrium with the electrons and lattice. The scattering of quasiparticles by TLS impurities leads to sub-gap states below the bulk excitation gap, $\Delta$, as well as resonances in the continuum above $\Delta$. The energies and spectral weights of these states depend on the distribution of tunnel splittings, while the spectral weights are particularly sensitive to the level occupation of the TLS impurities. Under microwave excitation, or decoupling from the thermal bath, a nonequilibrium level population of the TLS distribution generates subgap quasiparticle states near the Fermi level which contribute to dissipation and thus degrade the performance of superconducting devices at low temperatures.

Title: BaZrS$_\text{3}$ Lights Up: The Interplay of Electrons, Photons, and Phonons in Strongly Luminescent Single Crystals
Authors: Rasmus Svejstrup Nielsen, Ángel Labordet Álvarez, Yvonne Tomm, Galina Gurieva, Andres Ortega-Guerrero, Joachim Breternitz, Lorenzo Bastonero, Nicola Marzari, Carlo Antonio Pignedoli, Susan Schorr, Mirjana Dimitrievska
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials for the next generation of optoelectronic applications, with BaZrS$_\text{3}$ attracting significant attention due to its wide bandgap, earth-abundant composition, and thermal and chemical stability. However, previous studies have consistently reported weak and ambiguous photoluminescence (PL), regardless of synthesis method, raising questions about the intrinsic optoelectronic quality of this compound. In this work, we demonstrate strong, band-to-band-dominated PL at room temperature in high-quality BaZrS$_\text{3}$ single crystals. Despite the narrow, single-component PL emission band, time-resolved PL measurements reveal a carrier lifetime of $1.0\pm0.2$ ns. To understand the origin of the strong PL and short carrier lifetime, we perform multiwavelength excitation and polarization-dependent Raman measurements, supported by first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. We identify all 23 theoretically predicted Raman-active modes and their symmetries, providing a comprehensive reference for future studies. Our results indicate that phonon-assisted carrier decay and strong electron-phonon coupling contribute to the short carrier lifetimes, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Further studies on compositional variations or partial cation/anion substitutions could mitigate electron-phonon coupling and enhance carrier lifetimes. By establishing a detailed reference for the intrinsic vibrational and optoelectronic properties of BaZrS$_\text{3}$, this work paves the way for further advancements in chalcogenide perovskites for energy and optoelectronic technologies.

Title: Electron transport in disordered insulating lattice under nonlinear electric field
Authors: Kunal Mozumdar, Herbert F. Fotso, Jong E. Han
Abstract: Transport in disordered systems often occurs via the variable range hopping (VRH) in the dilute carrier density limit, where electrons hop between randomly distributed localized levels. We study the nonequilibrium transport by a uniform DC electric field on a one-dimensional insulating tight-binding chain with the on-site disorder, using a finite-lattice calculation and the coherent potential approximation. We develop a theory of electric-field-assisted variable range hopping as a mechanism for nonlinear transport in a disordered chain. Our finite-lattice calculations of the electron propagation distance and the electron mobility determine the range of the variable range hopping as $\Delta < W \lesssim 2\Delta$ in the gap $\Delta$. We further propose a nonlinear scaling of the conductivity by an electric field that is similar to Mott's variable range hopping in equilibrium. The nonlinear conductivity of an electronic lattice model follows the scaling law $\sigma(E) \propto \exp[-(E_0/E)^{\nu}]$ with the exponent $\nu = 1/3$ in one dimension for the VRH. We also discuss the experimental relevance of temperature-dependent nonlinear current-voltage relation.

Title: Moiré Superradiance in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with Quantum Atom Gas
Authors: Lu Zhou, Zheng-Chun Li, Keye Zhang, Zhihao Lan, Alessio Celi, Weiping Zhang
Abstract: As a novel platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, the moiré lattice has garnered significant interest in solid-state physics, photonics, and cold atom physics. While moiré lattices in two- and three-dimensional systems have been proposed for neutral cold atoms, the simpler one-dimensional moiré effect remains largely unexplored. We present a scheme demonstrating moiré effects in a one-dimensional cold atom-cavity coupling system, which resembles a generalized open Dicke model exhibiting superradiant phase transitions. We reveal a strong link between the phase transition critical point and the one-dimensional moiré parameter. Additionally, we derive the cavity field spectrum, connected to the dynamical structure factor, and showcase controlled atomic diffusion. This work provides a new route for testing one-dimensional moiré effects with cold atoms and open new possibility of moiré metrology.

Title: Intrinsic back-switching phenomenon in SOT-MRAM devices
Authors: Kuldeep Ray, Jérémie Vigier, Perrine Usé, Sylvain Martin, Nicolas Lefoulon, Chloé Bouard, Marc Drouard, Gilles Gaudin
Abstract: The writing process of SOT-MRAMs is considered deterministic when additional symmetry-breaking factors, such as the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the current, are present. Notably, the write probability exhibits a unique behavior as a function of the current: it drops to zero at high currents or even oscillates with the current. This phenomenon is attributed to back-switching, an intrinsic effect of magnetization reversal driven by spin-orbit torques. A systematic investigation of this back-switching phenomenon is conducted on sub-100 nm CoFeB magnetic pillars positioned at the center of $\beta$-W Hall crosses. Using a statistical approach, the study examines the impact of various parameters, including the amplitude of current pulses and the application of magnetic fields in different directions. The findings reveal that the back-switching phenomenon is not statistically random. Macrospin simulations, employing realistic magnetic parameter values, accurately replicate the experimental observations and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of back-switching. These simulations also explore strategies to mitigate the phenomenon, such as optimizing the shape of the writing pulses. Applying this approach to complete SOT-MRAM single cells achieves a write error rate below $2 \times 10^{-6}$, demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy in expanding the operational current range for write operations in SOT-MRAMs.

Title: Beyond 5 GHz excitation of a ZnO-based high-overtone bulk acoustic resonator on SiC substrate
Authors: Padmalochan Panda, Soumyadip Chatterjee, Siddharth Tallur, Apurba Laha
Abstract: This work reports on the fabrication and characterization of an Au/ZnO/Pt-based high-overtone bulk acoustic resonator (HBAR) on SiC substrates. We evaluate its microwave characteristics comparing with Si substrates for micro-electromechanical applications. Dielectric magnetron sputtering and an electron beam evaporator are employed to develop highly c-axis-oriented ZnO films and metal electrodes. The crystal structure and surface morphology of post-growth layers have been characterized using X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. HBAR on SiC substrate results in multiple longitudinal bulk acoustic wave resonances up to 7 GHz, with the strongest excited resonances emerging at 5.25 GHz. The value of f.Q (Resonance frequency * Quality factor) parameter obtained using a novel Q approach method for HBAR on SiC substrate is 4.1 * 10^13 Hz, which to the best of our knowledge, is the highest among all reported values for specified ZnO-based devices.

Title: Bethe ansatz inside Calogero-Sutherland models
Authors: Gwenaël Ferrando, Jules Lamers, Fedor Levkovich-Maslyuk, Didina Serban
Abstract: We study the trigonometric quantum spin-Calogero-Sutherland model, and the Haldane-Shastry spin chain as a special case, using a Bethe-ansatz analysis. We harness the model's Yangian symmetry to import the standard tools of integrability for Heisenberg spin chains into the world of integrable long-range models with spins. From the transfer matrix with a diagonal twist we construct Heisenberg-style symmetries (Bethe algebra) that refine the usual hierarchy of commuting Hamiltonians (quantum determinant) of the spin-Calogero-Sutherland model. We compute the first few of these new conserved charges explicitly, and diagonalise them by Bethe ansatz inside each irreducible Yangian representation. This yields a new eigenbasis for the spin-Calogero-Sutherland model that generalises the Yangian Gelfand-Tsetlin basis of Takemura-Uglov. The Bethe-ansatz analysis involves non-generic values of the inhomogeneities. Our review of the inhomogeneous Heisenberg XXX chain, with special attention to how the Bethe ansatz works in the presence of fusion, may be of independent interest.

Title: A midsurface elasticity model for a thin, nonlinear, gradient elastic plate
Authors: C. Rodriguez
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a dynamic surface elasticity model for the two-dimensional midsurface of a thin, three-dimensional, homogeneous, isotropic, nonlinear gradient elastic plate of thickness $h$. The resulting model is parameterized by five, conceivably measurable, physical properties of the plate, and the stored surface energy reduces to Koiter's plate energy in a singular limiting case. The model corrects a theoretical issue found in wave propagation in thin sheets and, when combined with the author's theory of Green elastic bodies possessing gradient elastic material boundary surfaces, removes the singularities present in fracture within traditional/classical models. Our approach diverges from previous research on thin shells and plates, which primarily concentrated on deriving elasticity theories for material surfaces from classical three-dimensional Green elasticity. This work is the first in rigorously developing a surface elasticity model based on a parent nonlinear gradient elasticity theory.

Title: Decomposing the Spectral Form Factor
Authors: Pablo Martinez-Azcona, Ruth Shir, Aurélia Chenu
Abstract: Correlations between the energies of a system's spectrum are one of the defining features of quantum chaos. They can be probed using the Spectral Form Factor (SFF). We investigate how each spectral distance contributes in building this two-point correlation function. Specifically, starting from the spectral distribution of $k$-th neighbor level spacing ($k$nLS), we provide analytical expressions for the $k$-th neighbor Spectral Form Factor ($k$nSFF). We do so for the three Gaussian Random Matrix ensembles and the `Poissonian' ensemble of uncorrelated energy levels. We study the properties of the $k$nSFF, namely its minimum value and the time at which this minimum is reached, as well as the energy spacing with the deepest $k$nSFF. This allows us to quantify the contribution of each individual $k$nLS to the SFF ramp, which is a characteristic feature of quantum chaos. In particular, we show how the onset of the ramp, characterized either by the dip or the Thouless time, shifts to shorter times as contributions from longer-range spectral distance are included. Interestingly, the even and odd neighbors contribute quite distinctively, the first being the most important to built the ramp. They respectively yield a resonance or antiresonance in the ramp. All of our analytical results are tested against numerical realizations of random matrices. We complete our analysis and show how the introduced tools help characterize the spectral properties of a physical many-body system by looking at the interacting XXZ Heisenberg model with local on-site disorder that allows transitioning between the chaotic and integrable regimes.

Title: Achieving quantum advantage in a search for a violations of the Goldbach conjecture, with driven atoms in tailored potentials
Authors: Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Andrea Trombettoni, Giuseppe Mussardo, Maxim Olshanii
Abstract: The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p^{\text{(I)}}$ and $p^{\text{(II)}}$. In this article we propose a quantum analogue device that solves the following problem: given a small prime $p^{\text{(I)}}$, identify a member $N$ of a $\mathcal{N}$-strong set even numbers for which $N-p^{\text{(I)}}$ is also a prime. A table of suitable large primes $p^{\text{(II)}}$ is assumed to be known a priori. The device realizes the Grover quantum search protocol and as such ensures a $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}}$ quantum advantage. Our numerical example involves a set of 51 even numbers just above the highest even classical-numerically explored so far [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation {\bf 83}, 2033 (2013)]. For a given small prime number $p^{\text{(I)}}=223$, it took our quantum algorithm 5 steps to identify the number $N=4\times 10^{18}+14$ as featuring a Goldbach partition involving $223$ and another prime, namely $p^{\text{(II)}}=4\times 10^{18}-239$. Currently, our algorithm limits the number of evens to be tested simultaneously to $\mathcal{N} \sim \ln(N)$: larger samples will typically contain more than one even that can be partitioned with the help of a given $p^{\text{(I)}}$, thus leading to a departure from the Grover paradigm.

Title: Percolation Effect Induced Significant Change of Complex Permittivity and Permeability for Silver-Epoxy Nano-Composites
Authors: Bo-Wei Tseng, Tsun-Hsu Chang
Abstract: The intricate interplay between complex permittivity and permeability constitutes the cornerstone of electromagnetic (EM) applications, enabling precise customization for various uses. This study employed silver-epoxy nano-composites to exemplify a conductor-insulator composite, leveraging silver's exceptional attributes, such as high conductivity and low reactivity. The determination of complex permittivity and permeability was conducted via the transmission/reflection method. At lower concentrations of dispersed silver particles, these nano-particles within the epoxy resin act as modest dipoles, augmenting permittivity. This regime aligns closely with the effective medium theory (EMT) and comprises the focus of much research. However, nearing the percolation threshold, a percolation effect emerges, drastically accelerating enhancement rates beyond the predictions of EMT. Simultaneously, long-wavelength electromagnetic waves induce diamagnetic currents within loops formed by metal grains. This diamagnetic effect intensifies with increasing volume fraction, leading to a reduction in permeability. This study observed percolation power law behavior near the threshold with calculated critical exponents. Consequently, the dielectric constant of the silver-epoxy nano-composite reached a maximum of 515. Regarding permeability, the lowest recorded value was 0.31. These findings were obtained within the X-band (8.2 GHz~12.4 GHz) region.

Title: Dataset-learning duality and emergent criticality
Authors: Ekaterina Kukleva, Vitaly Vanchurin
Abstract: In artificial neural networks, the activation dynamics of non-trainable variables is strongly coupled to the learning dynamics of trainable variables. During the activation pass, the boundary neurons (e.g., input neurons) are mapped to the bulk neurons (e.g., hidden neurons), and during the learning pass, both bulk and boundary neurons are mapped to changes in trainable variables (e.g., weights and biases). For example, in feed-forward neural networks, forward propagation is the activation pass and backward propagation is the learning pass. We show that a composition of the two maps establishes a duality map between a subspace of non-trainable boundary variables (e.g., dataset) and a tangent subspace of trainable variables (i.e., learning). In general, the dataset-learning duality is a complex non-linear map between high-dimensional spaces. We use duality to study the emergence of criticality, or the power-law distribution of fluctuations of the trainable variables, using a toy model at learning equilibrium. In particular, we show that criticality can emerge in the learning system even from the dataset in a non-critical state, and that the power-law distribution can be modified by changing either the activation function or the loss function.

Title: A normalized gradient flow method for computing ground states of spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Weizhu Bao, Qinglin Tang, Yongjun Yuan
Abstract: We propose and analyze an efficient and accurate numerical method for computing ground states of spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) by using the normalized gradient flow (NGF). In order to successfully extend the NGF to spin-2 BECs which has five components in the vector wave function but with only two physical constraints on total mass conservation and magnetization conservation, two important techniques are introduced for designing the proposed numerical method. The first one is to systematically investigate the ground state structure and property of spin-2 BECs within a spatially uniform system, which can be used on how to properly choose initial data in the NGF for computing ground states of spin-2 BECs. The second one is to introduce three additional projection conditions based on the relations between the chemical potentials, together with the two existing physical constraints, such that the five projection parameters used in the projection step of the NGF can be uniquely determined. Then a backward-forward Euler finite difference method is adapted to discretize the NGF. We prove rigorously that there exists a unique solution of the nonlinear system for determining the five projection parameters in the full discretization of the NGF under a mild condition on the time step size. Extensive numerical results on ground states of spin-2 BECs with different types of phases and under different potentials are reported to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed numerical method and to demonstrate several interesting physical phenomena on ground states of spin-2 BECs.

Title: Time-resolved Stochastic Dynamics of Quantum Thermal Machines
Authors: Abhaya S. Hegde, Patrick P. Potts, Gabriel T. Landi
Abstract: Steady-state quantum thermal machines are typically characterized by a continuous flow of heat between different reservoirs. However, at the level of discrete stochastic realizations, heat flow is unraveled as a series of abrupt quantum jumps, each representing an exchange of finite quanta with the environment. In this work, we present a framework that resolves the dynamics of quantum thermal machines into cycles classified as engine-like, cooling-like, or idle. We analyze the statistics of individual cycle types and their durations, enabling us to determine both the fraction of cycles useful for thermodynamic tasks and the average waiting time between cycles of a given type. Central to our analysis is the notion of intermittency, which captures the operational consistency of the machine by assessing the frequency and distribution of idle cycles. Our framework offers a novel approach to characterizing thermal machines with significant relevance to experiments involving mesoscopic transport through quantum dots.

Title: Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits
Authors: Menghan Song, Zhaoyi Zeng, Ting-Tung Wang, Yi-Zhuang You, Zi Yang Meng, Pengfei Zhang
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.

Title: Scar-induced imbalance in staggered Rydberg ladders
Authors: Mainak Pal, Madhumita Sarkar, K. Sengupta, Arnab Sen
Abstract: We demonstrate that the kinematically-constrained model of Rydberg atoms on a two-leg ladder with staggered detuning, $\Delta \in [0,1]$, has quantum many-body scars (QMBS) in its spectrum and represents a non-perturbative generalization of the paradigmatic PXP model defined on a chain. We show that these QMBS result in coherent many-body revivals and site-dependent magnetization dynamics for both Néel and Rydberg vacuum initial states around $\Delta=1$. The latter feature leads to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH)-violating finite imbalance at long times in a disorder-free system. This is further demonstrated by constructing appropriate local imbalance operators that display nonzero long-time averages for Néel and vacuum initial states. We also study the fidelity and Shannon entropy for such dynamics which, along with the presence of long-time finite imbalance, brings out the qualitatively different nature of QMBS in PXP ladders with $\Delta \sim 1$ from those in the PXP chain. Finally, we identify additional exact mid-spectrum zero modes that stay unchanged as a function of $\Delta$ and violate ETH.

Title: Settling dynamics of non-Brownian suspension of spherical and cubic particles in Stokes flow
Authors: Dipankar Kundu, Florencio Balboa Usabiaga, Marco Ellero
Abstract: The present study investigates the gravity-driven settling dynamics of non-Brownian suspensions of spherical and cubic particles within a triply periodic domain. The effect of solid volume fraction on the evolving microstructure of a suspension is numerically examined by employing the Rigid MultiBlob method under Stokes flow conditions. Our simulations accurately reproduce macroscopic trends observed in experiments and show strong agreement with established semi-empirical correlations over a wide range of volume fractions. It is observed that the hydrodynamic interactions between particles and the surrounding fluid dominate the settling mechanism at low to moderate solid volume fractions, whereas, frequent collisions between particles in a highly packed space tend to suppress velocity fluctuations at denser regime. The transport properties for dilute suspensions are found to be primarily shaped by an anisotropic microstructure, though this anisotropy decreases as many-body interactions significantly grow at higher volume fractions. Notably, cubic particles exhibit lower anisotropy in velocity fluctuations compared to spheres, due to more effective momentum and energy transfer from the gravity-driven direction to transverse directions. Moreover, cubic particles also display higher velocity fluctuations and particle rebounding after collisions, which may create a transient tendency for cubes to move against gravity more readily than spheres. The distinctive behaviors of cubic and spherical particles can notably influence the efficiency of size segregation in bidisperse mixtures. Interestingly, local velocity fluctuation intensity increases for both particle types in mixed suspensions, affecting the local sedimentation velocity field. Overall, spherical particles are found to settle faster than cubes at low to moderate volume fractions.

Title: Transport in multifractal Kraichnan flows: from turbulence to Liouville quantum gravity
Authors: André L. P. Considera, Simon Thalabard
Abstract: We investigate the behaviors of fluid parcel trajectories in a multifractal extension of the Kraichnan model of turbulent advection, obtained by coupling one-dimensional monofractal white-in-time Gaussian flows to a frozen-in-time Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC). The resulting random flows are characterized by the interplay between a smoothness exponent $\xi\in(0,2)$ controlling the correlation decay of the Gaussian component and the intermittency parameter $\gamma \in (0,\sqrt 2)$ prescribing the deviations from self-similarity. In recent numerical work, this coupling was observed to induce a smoothing effect, whereby two-particle separations exhibit behavior similar to those in (monofractal) Gaussian flows only with increased smoothness exponent. The purpose of this work is to develop a rigorous theory of this phenomenon, contrasting the quenched setting where the GMC has prescribed realization to an annealed setting where the GMC is averaged over. Using the theory of 1D Markov processes we characterize the Lagrangian flow through boundary behaviors at the origin for the two-particle separation process upon varying $\xi$ and $\gamma$. This extends to a multifractal setting the stochastic/deterministic transition and the coalescing/non-coalescing transition well known in the monofractal Kraichnan setting. We show that the separation process present some analogies with multiplicative 1D versions of the Liouville Brownian Motion, a canonical diffusion evolving within a random landscape induced by the GMC and previously introduced in the context of Liouville quantum gravity. In particular, both quenched and annealed phase diagrams are retrieved upon considering a multiplicative Liouville Brownian motion characterized by a smoothness parameter $\xi+\gamma^2$ and an intermittency exponent $\gamma$.

Abstract: We show how a strange metal emerges from the long-range quantum entanglements. Given that the quenched average of a spatially random coupling between a Fermi surface and critical bosons results in linear-$T$ resistivity, we first calculate the annealed average of the model and find that it also give the linear resistivity. We then observe that the correlator of the 'coupling field' in quenched average can be interpreted as the wormholes that connect pair of points separated by arbitrary distance, while the annealed average can be interpreted as a pure system without disorder having quantum entanglements between the connected pairs. We show that, in the large-$N$ limit, two averages are equivalent. Therefore we suggest that this equivalence provides insight to the precise meaning of $ER=EPR$ conjecture in the context of an explicit model with well defined computation. Also, we point out that the wormhole picture clarifies why a SYK-rized model describes the strongly interacting system even in the case the averaged coupling strength is tiny.
