Title: Magnetic order through Kondo coupling to quantum spin liquids
Authors: M. A. Keskiner, M. Ö. Oktel, Natalia B. Perkins, Onur Erten
Abstract: We study the emergence of magnetic order in localized spins that interact solely through their coupling to a Kitaev-type spin liquid. Using three toy models -- the Kitaev model, the Yao-Lee model, and a square-lattice generalization of the Kitaev model -- we calculate the effective exchange Hamiltonians mediated by the fractionalized excitations of these spin liquids. This setup is analogous to a Kondo lattice model, where conduction electrons are replaced by itinerant Majorana fermions. In the Kitaev model, our results show that the lowest-order perturbation theory generates short-range interactions with modified couplings and extending to sixth order introduces longer-range interactions while preserving the quantum spin-liquid ground state. Models involving more Majorana flavors on honeycomb and square lattices exhibit more complex behavior. The honeycomb Yao-Lee model with three flavors of itinerant Majorana fermions generates long-range RKKY-type interactions, leading to antiferromagnetic order and partial gapping of the Majorana fermion spectrum. In contrast, the square-lattice model produces a combination of anisotropic short- and long-range interactions, which can give rise to either a dimerized quantum paramagnetic state or an Ising antiferromagnet, depending on the parameters. These results illustrate the rich variety of magnetic orders that can be mediated by Kitaev-type spin liquids.

Title: Lattice Defects in Rydberg Atom Arrays
Authors: Hanteng Wang, Chengshu Li, Xingyu Li, Yingfei Gu, Shang Liu
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have become a key platform for studying quantum many-body systems. In these setups, defects arise naturally due to various imperfections and can significantly modify the theoretical predictions compared to an ideal model. Here, we investigate the impact of geometric defects in the simplest situation -- a one-dimensional Rydberg atom array, both at and away from its emergent Ising criticality. In the presence of defects, we demonstrate that relevant physical quantities can be extracted from one-point correlation functions. At the critical point, we show that different types of kinks yield distinct outcomes corresponding to their respective spatial-internal symmetries: site-centered kinks can effectively break the array at the kink position regardless of the kink angle, while bond-centered kinks lead to interesting intermediate-coupling fixed points. In the latter case, due to a special renormalization group flow trajectory, the whole system can appear ordered if the system is not large enough. Additionally, away from criticality, the bond-centered kink induces a localization-delocalization transition of the domain wall, characteristic of quantum wetting. These findings highlight the utility of kinks as experimental probes and stress the importance of controlling defects so that experimental observations remain faithful to the pristine model.

Title: Terahertz electroluminescence from Dirac-Landau polaritons
Authors: B. Benhamou-Bui, C. Consejo, S.S. Krishtopenko, S. Ruffenach, C. Bray, J. Torres, J. Dzian, F. Le Mardelé, A. Pagot, X. Baudry, S.V. Morozov, N.N. Mikhailov, S.A. Dvoretskii, B. Jouault, P. Ballet, M. Orlita, C. Ciuti, F. Teppe
Abstract: We report intense terahertz electroluminescence from Dirac-Landau polaritons, representing a major step toward achieving stimulated cyclotron emission and polariton-based lasers. By strongly coupling the cyclotron transitions of two-dimensional Dirac fermions in HgTe quantum wells with optical cavity modes, we observe efficient emission near the lasing threshold. This work demonstrates that polariton condensation, a process that bypasses the need for electronic population inversion, can significantly reduce the emission threshold compared to conventional mechanisms requiring high electric fields. Moreover, this concept unlocks the potential for stimulated emission in previously unsuitable narrow-gap semiconductors, as well as Dirac materials with non-equidistant Landau levels. These results open a new way for the development of compact, tunable terahertz lasers based on Landau polaritons, offering new opportunities for solid-state laser technology and applications in the terahertz gap.

Title: Imaging van Hove Singularity Heterogeneity in Overdoped Graphene
Authors: Raymond Blackwell, Zengyi Du, Takuya Okugawa, Asish Kundu, Zebin Wu, Ilya Drozdov, Angel Rubio, Dante Kennes, Kazuhiro Fujita, Abhay Pasupathy
Abstract: Tuning the chemical potential of a solid to the vicinity of a van Hove singularity (vHS) is a well-established route to discovering emergent quantum phases. In monolayer graphene, the use of electron-donating metal layers has recently emerged as a method to dope the chemical potential to the nearest vHS, as evidenced by Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. In this work, we study the spatial uniformity of the doping from this process using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM). Using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), we achieve electron doping of graphene on SiC using Ytterbium (Yb-Graphene). We show using in-situ ARPES that the chemical potential is shifted to within 250 meV of the vHS. Using in-situ SI-STM, we establish that there exists significant inhomogeneity in the vHS position in overdoped graphene. We find two separate reasons for this. First, the spatial inhomogeneity of the intercalated Yb leads to local variations in the doping, with a length scale of inhomogeneity set by the screening length of ~ 3 nm. Second, we observe the presence of substitutional Yb dopants in the graphene basal plane. These Yb dopants cause a strong local shift of the doping, along with a renormalization of the quasiparticle amplitude. Theoretical calculations confirm that the Yb impurities effectively change the local potential, thus energetically shifting the position of the van Hove singularity. Our results point to the importance of considering the spatial structure of doping and its inextricable link to electronic structure.

Title: Iterative charge equilibration for fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potentials
Authors: Emir Kocer, Andreas Singraber, Jonas Finkler, Philipp Misof, Tsz Wai Ko, Christoph Dellago, Jörg Behler
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLP) allow to perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with about the same accuracy as electronic structure calculations provided that the selected model is able to capture the relevant physics of the system. For systems exhibiting long-range charge transfer, fourth-generation MLPs need to be used, which take global information about the system and electrostatic interactions into account. This can be achieved in a charge equilibration (QEq) step, but the direct solution (dQEq) of the set of linear equations results in an unfavorable cubic scaling with system size making this step computationally demanding for large systems. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that is based on the iterative solution of the charge equilibration problem (iQEq) to determine the atomic partial charges. We have implemented the iQEq method, which scales quadratically with system size, in the parallel molecular dynamics software LAMMPS for the example of a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential (4G-HDNNP) intended to be used in combination with the n2p2 library. The method itself is general and applicable to many different types of fourth-generation MLPs. An assessment of the accuracy and the efficiency is presented for a benchmark system of FeCl$_3$ in water.

Title: Interpretable and Equation-Free Response Theory for Complex Systems
Authors: Valerio Lucarini
Abstract: Response theory provides a pathway for understanding the sensitivity of a system and, more in general, to predict how its statistical properties change as a possibly time-dependent perturbation is applied. Recently discovered general forms of the celebrated Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem allow for expressing response operators as correlation functions of suitably defined observables in the unperturbed state, also when such a state is far from equilibrium. In the case of complex and multiscale systems, to achieved enhanced practical applicability, response theory must be interpretable, capable of focusing of relevant timescales, and amenable to implemented by data-driven approaches that are potentially equation-agnostic. Complex systems typically exhibit a hierarchy of temporal behaviors, and unresolved or undesired timescales can obscure the dominant mechanisms driving macroscopic responses. As an element of this desired framework, in the spirit of Markov state modelling, we propose here a comprehensive analysis of the linear and nonlinear response of Markov chains to general time-dependent perturbations. We obtain simple and easily implementable formulas that can be used to predict the response of observables as well as higher-order correlations of the system. The methodology proposed here can be implemented in a purely data-driven setting and even if we do not know the underlying evolution equations. The use of algebraic expansions inspired by Koopmanism allow to elucidate the role of different time scales and find explicit and interpretable expressions for the Green's functions at all orders. We illustrate our methodology in a very simple yet instructive metastable system. Finally, our results provide a dynamical foundation for the Prony method, which is commonly used for the statistical analysis of discrete time signals.

Title: Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations for Coherent Transport
Authors: Kay Brandner, Keiji Saito
Abstract: We derive a universal thermodynamic uncertainty relation for Fermionic coherent transport, which bounds the total rate of entropy production in terms of the mean and fluctuations of a single particle current. This bound holds for any multi-terminal geometry and arbitrary chemical and thermal biases, as long as no external magnetic fields are applied. It can further be saturated in two-terminal settings with boxcar-shaped transmission functions and reduces to its classical counterpart in linear response. Upon insertion of a numerical factor, our bound also extends to systems with broken time-reversal symmetry. As an application, we derive trade-off relations between the figures of merit of coherent thermoelectric heat engines and refrigerators, which show that such devices can attain ideal efficiency only at vanishing mean power or diverging power fluctuations. To illustrate our results, we work out a model of a coherent conductor consisting of a chain of quantum dots.

Title: Local doping of an oxide semiconductor by voltage-driven splitting of anti-Frenkel defects
Authors: Jiali He, Ursula Ludacka, Kasper A. Hunnestad, Didrik R. Småbråten, Konstantin Shapovalov, Per Erik Vullum, Constantinos Hatzoglou, Donald M. Evans, Erik D. Roede, Zewu Yan, Edith Bourret, Sverre M. Selbach, David Gao, Jaakko Akola, Dennis Meier
Abstract: Layered oxides exhibit high ionic mobility and chemical flexibility, attracting interest as cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries and the pairing of hydrogen production and carbon capture. Recently, layered oxides emerged as highly tunable semiconductors. For example, by introducing anti-Frenkel defects, the electronic hopping conductance in hexagonal manganites was increased locally by orders of magnitude. Here, we demonstrate local acceptor and donor doping in Er(Mn,Ti)O$_3$, facilitated by the splitting of such anti-Frenkel defects under applied d.c. voltage. By combining density functional theory calculations, scanning probe microscopy, atom probe tomography, and scanning transmission electron microscopy, we show that the oxygen defects readily move through the layered crystal structure, leading to nano-sized interstitial-rich (p-type) and vacancy-rich (n-type) regions. The resulting pattern is comparable to dipolar npn-junctions and stable on the timescale of days. Our findings reveal the possibility of temporarily functionalizing oxide semiconductors at the nanoscale, giving additional opportunities for the field of oxide electronics and the development of transient electronics in general.

Title: Revealing isotropic abundant low-energy excitations in UTe$_2$ through complex microwave surface impedance
Authors: Arthur Carlton-Jones, Alonso Suarez, Yun-Suk Eo, Ian M. Hayes, Shanta R. Saha, Johnpierre Paglione, Nicholas P. Butch, Steven M. Anlage
Abstract: The complex surface impedance is a well-established tool to study the super- and normal-fluid responses of superconductors. Fundamental properties of the superconductor, such as the pairing mechanism, Fermi surface, and topological properties, also influence the surface impedance. We explore the microwave surface impedance of spin-triplet UTe$_2$ single crystals as a function of temperature using resonant cavity perturbation measurements employing a novel multi-modal analysis to gain insight into these properties. We determine a composite surface impedance of the crystal for each mode using resonance data combined with the independently measured normal state dc resistivity tensor. The normal state surface impedance reveals the weighting of current flow directions in the crystal of each resonant mode. For UTe$_2$, we find an isotropic $\Delta \lambda(T) \sim T^\alpha$ power-law temperature dependence for the magnetic penetration depth for $T\le T_c/3$ with $\alpha < 2$, which is inconsistent with a single pair of point nodes on the Fermi surface under weak scattering. We also find a similar power-law temperature dependence for the low-temperature surface resistance $R_s(T) \sim T^{\alpha_R}$ with $\alpha_R < 2$. We observe a strong anisotropy of the residual microwave loss across these modes, with some modes showing loss below the universal line-nodal value, to those showing substantially more. We compare to predictions for topological Weyl superconductivity in the context of the observed isotropic power-laws, and anisotropy of the residual loss.

Title: The Augmented Potential Method: Multiscale Modeling Toward a Spectral Defect Genome
Authors: Nutth Tuchinda, Changle Li, Christopher A. Schuh
Abstract: The modeling of solute chemistry at low-symmetry defects in materials is historically challenging, due to the computation cost required to evaluate thermodynamic properties from first principles. Here, we offer a hybrid multiscale approach called the augmented potential method that connects the chemical flexibility and near-quantum accuracy of a universal machine learning potential at the site of the defect, with the computational speed of a long-range classical potential implemented away from the defect site in a buffer zone. The method allows us to rapidly compute distributions of grain boundary segregation energy for 1,050 binary alloy pairs (including Ag, Al, Au, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mo, Nb, Ni, Pd, Pt, Ta and V, W solvent), creating a database for polycrystalline grain boundary segregation. This database is ~5x larger than previously published spectral compilations, and yet has improved accuracy. The approach can also address problems far beyond the reach of any other method, such as handling bcc Fe-based alloys, or the complex solute-solute interactions in random polycrystals. The approach thus paves a pathway toward a complete defect genome in crystalline materials.

Title: Grain Boundary Segregation Spectra from a Generalized Machine-learning Potential
Authors: Nutth Tuchinda, Christopher A. Schuh
Abstract: Modeling solute segregation to grain boundaries at near first-principles accuracy is a daunting task, particularly at finite concentrations and temperatures that require accurate assessments of solute-solute interactions and excess vibrational entropy of segregation that are computationally intensive. Here, we apply a generalized machine learning potential for 16 elements, including Ag, Al, Au, Cr, Cu, Mg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Pd, Pt, Ta, Ti, V, W and Zr, to provide a self-consistent spectral database for all of these energetic components in of 240 binary alloy polycrystals. The segregation spectra of Al-based alloys are validated against past quantum-accurate simulations and show improved predictive ability with some existing atom probe tomography experimental data.

Title: Phonon vibrational and transport properties of SnSe/SnS superlattice at finite temperatures
Authors: Feng-ning Xue, Wei Li, Zi Li, Yong Lu
Abstract: The structural stability and phonon properties of SnSe/SnS superlattices at finite temperatures have been studied using machine learning force field molecular dynamics and the anharmonic phonon approach. The vertical SnSe/SnS superlattice undergoes a phase transition from the Pnma phase to a novel P4/nmm phase at finite temperatures, which is different from the high-temperature Cmcm phase of the SnSe and SnS systems. The stability of P4/nmm phase is determined by molecular dynamics trajectories and anharmonic phonon dispersion relations. The imaginary modes of TO modes at the q=M(1/2,1/2,0) point of the P4/nmm phase in harmonic approximation become rigid at elevated temperatures. An analysis of phonon power spectra upon temperature also confirms the dynamic stabilization. The P4/nmm phase has higher symmetry than the Pnma phase, and the phase transition between them is accompanied by competition between the Jahn-Teller effect and phonon anharmonicity. Unlike the anisotropic distribution of Sn-Se/S bonds in the Pnma phase, the P4/nmm phase forms chemical bonds with similar bond lengths both in-plane and interlayer, and their resonance effect can significantly enhance phonon scattering. The calculated phonon density of states and lifetime is strongly temperature dependent, demonstrating the heavy anharmonicity in the SnSe/SnS system. The P4/nmm phase has an extremely low lattice thermal conductivity, close to the experimental values of SnSe and SnS. Moreover, with the reduction of band gap and the enhancement of band degeneracy near the Fermi level, the P4/nmm phase exhibits superior electronic transport properties and significantly enhanced response to infrared and visible light. This makes it show great potential in thermoelectric and photovoltaic applications.

Title: The chemisorption thermodynamics of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on AFM UO$_2$ surfaces unraveled by DFT+U-D3 study
Authors: Yang Huang, Le Zhang, Hefei Ji, Zhipeng Zhang, Qili Zhang, Bo Sun, Haifeng Liu, Haifeng Song
Abstract: Unraveling the adsorption mechanism and thermodynamics of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on uranium dioxide surfaces is critical for the nuclear fuel storage and uranium corrosion. Based on the first-principles DFT+U-D3 calculations, we carefully test the effect of antiferromagnetic order arrangements on the thermodynamic stability of UO$_2$ surfaces and propose the 1k AFM surface computational model. The chemisorption states of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on UO$_2$ (111) surface, suggested by previous experiments, are accurately calculated for the first time. The adsorption properties of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on UO$_2$(111) and (110) surfaces are discussed in detail to reveal the different interaction mechanisms. Combined with ab initio atomistic thermodynamics method, we systematically calculate the chemisorption phase diagram and isotherm of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on UO$_2$ surfaces. Due to the different intermolecular interactions, the monolayer and multilayer adsorption models are identified for O$_2$ and H$_2$O, respectively. This study has comprehensively revealed the different adsorption mechanisms of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on UO$_2$ surfaces, bridging the electronic structure calculations to the interpretation of experimental results and providing a solid foundation for future theoretical studies of uranium corrosion mechanism in humid air.

Title: The quantum Mpemba effects
Authors: Filiberto Ares, Pasquale Calabrese, Sara Murciano
Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a hotter system can equilibrate faster than a cooler one, has long been a subject of fascination in classical physics. In the past few years, significant theoretical and experimental progress has been made in understanding its occurrence in both classical and quantum systems. In this review, we provide a concise overview of the Mpemba effect in quantum systems, with a focus on both open and isolated dynamics which give rise to distinct manifestations of this anomalous non-equilibrium phenomenon. We discuss key theoretical frameworks, highlight experimental observations, and explore the fundamental mechanisms that give rise to anomalous relaxation behaviors. Particular attention is given to the role of quantum fluctuations, integrability, and symmetry in shaping equilibration pathways. Finally, we outline open questions and future directions.

Title: Feshbach spectroscopy of ultracold mixtures of $^{6}{\rm Li}$ and $^{164}{\rm Dy}$ atoms
Authors: Ke Xie, Xi Li, Yu-Yang Zhou, Ji-Hong Luo, Shuai Wang, Yu-Zhao Nie, Hong-Chi Shen, Yu-Ao Chen, Xing-Can Yao, Jian-Wei Pan
Abstract: We report on the observation of Feshbach resonances in ultracold $^6\mathrm{Li}$-$^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ mixtures, where $^6\mathrm{Li}$ atoms are respectively prepared in their three lowest spin states, and $^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ atoms are prepared in their lowest energy state. We observe 21 interspecies scattering resonances over a magnetic field range from 0 to \SI{702}{\gauss} using atom loss spectroscopy, three of which exhibit relatively broad widths. These broad resonances provide precise control over the interspecies interaction strength, enabling the study of strongly interacting effects in $^6\mathrm{Li}$-$^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ mixtures. Additionally, we observe a well-isolated interspecies resonance at 700.1 G, offering a unique platform to explore novel impurity physics, where heavy dipolar $^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ atoms are immersed in a strongly interacting Fermi superfluid of $^6\mathrm{Li}$ atoms.

Title: Homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases in a flat-top optical lattice
Authors: Yu-Xuan Wang, Hou-Ji Shao, Yan-Song Zhu, De-Zhi Zhu, Hao-Nan Sun, Si-Yuan Chen, Xing-Can Yao, Yu-Ao Chen, Jian-Wei Pan
Abstract: Fermionic atoms in a large-scale, homogeneous optical lattice provide an ideal quantum simulator for investigating the fermionic Hubbard model, yet achieving this remains challenging. Here, by developing a hybrid potential that integrates a flat-top optical lattice with an optical box trap, we successfully realize the creation of three-dimensional, homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases across approximately $8\times10^5$ lattice sites. This homogeneous system enables us to capture a well-defined energy band occupation that aligns perfectly with the theoretical calculations for a zero-temperature, ideal fermionic Hubbard model. Furthermore, by employing novel radio-frequency spectroscopy, we precisely measure the doublon fraction $D$ as a function of interaction strength $U$ and temperature $T$, respectively. The crossover from metal to Mott insulator is detected, where $D$ smoothly decreases with increasing $U$. More importantly, we observe a non-monotonic temperature dependence in $D$, revealing the Pomeranchuk effect and the development of extended antiferromagnetic correlations.

Title: Epitaxial growth and transport properties of a metallic altermagnet CrSb on a GaAs (001) substrate
Authors: Seiji Aota, Masaaki Tanaka
Abstract: A newly identified class of magnetic materials called altermagnets has attracted much attention due to the practical properties of spin-splitting bands akin to ferromagnets and small compensated magnetization akin to antiferromagnets. These features make them promising candidates for applications in spintronics devices. Among candidate materials, CrSb is promising due to its high ordering temperature (705 K) and large spin-splitting energy; however, it is predicted that tuning the Néel vector requires additional symmetry breaking or a change in the easy magnetization axis. While applying epitaxial strain can modulate the symmetry, the selection of substrates with closely matched lattice constants for heteroepitaxial growth is limited for altermagnets, which generally have low crystal symmetry. Therefore, exploring the heteroepitaxial growth of altermagnet thin films on well-established, dissimilar crystal systems is valuable. (001)-oriented III-V semiconductors, which share group-V elements with the overgrown CrSb, offer an ideal platform because they are expected to have material compatibility with stable interfaces, as well as tunability of the buffer layer's bandgap and lattice constant by varying the atomic composition of their group-III and group-V atoms. In this study, we have achieved the molecular beam epitaxial growth of a CrSb ($\bar{1}10$) thin film on a GaAs (001) substrate by inserting thin FeSb ($\bar{1}10$) / AlAs (001) buffer layers. The in-plane epitaxial relationship is found to be CrSb [110] $\|$ GaAs [110] and CrSb [001] $\|$ GaAs [$\bar{1}10$], and epitaxial strain is also confirmed. We also characterized the magneto-transport properties of the grown CrSb thin film. Although the obtained conductivity tensors are mainly explained by a multi-carrier model, not by an anomalous Hall effect, this model reveals the presence of high-mobility electron and hole carriers.

Title: Room-Temperature Deuterium Separation in van der Waals Gap Engineered Vermiculite Quantum Sieves
Authors: Saini Lalita, Rathi Aparna, Kaushik Suvigya, Li-Hsien Yeh, Kalon Gopinadhan
Abstract: As the demand for nuclear energy grows, enriching deuterium from hydrogen mixtures has become more important. However, traditional methods are either very energy-intensive because they require extremely cold temperatures, or they don't separate deuterium (D2) from regular hydrogen (H2) very well, with a D2/H2 selectivity of about 0.71. To achieve efficient deuterium separation at room temperature, we need materials with very tiny spaces, on an atomic scale. For the first time, we've successfully created a material with spaces just about 2.1 angstroms wide, which is similar in size to the wavelength of hydrogen isotopes at room temperature. This allows for efficient deuterium separation, with a much higher D2/H2 selectivity of about 2.20, meaning the material can separate deuterium from hydrogen much more effectively at room temperature. The smaller deuterium molecules are more likely to pass through these tiny spaces, showing that quantum effects play a key role in this process. In contrast, a material like graphene oxide, with larger spaces (around 4.0 angstroms) only shows a lower D2/H2 selectivity of approx 1.17, indicating weaker quantum effects. This discovery suggests that materials with very small, atomic-scale spaces could be key to the efficient separation of hydrogen isotopes at room temperature.

Title: Long-Lived Coherence between Incoherent Excitons revealed by Time-Resolved ARPES: An Exact Solution
Authors: Zhenlin Zhang, Wei Hu, Enrico Perfetto, Gianluca Stefanucci
Abstract: We investigate the exciton dynamics in an exactly solvable two-band model for semiconductors. The model incorporates light-matter, electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, and captures exciton formation as well as the transition from the coherent to the incoherent regime. We analyze excitonic polarization, populations and coherences, with special focus on their impact in Time-Resolved and Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (TR-ARPES). For nonresonant pumping with below-gap photon energies, TR-ARPES spectra reveal distinct excitonic replica and quantum beats persisting in the incoherent regime. These are due to a coherence between different species of {\em incoherent} excitons. Such type of coherence is resistant to phonon dephasing, indicating that it follows different dynamics than those governing the coherences considered so far.

Title: Influence of 14N hyperfine interaction on electron nuclear double resonance of boron vacancy in hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: G.V. Mamin, E.V. Dmitrieva, F.F. Murzakhanov, I.N. Gracheva, V.A. Soltamov, M.R. Gafurov
Abstract: The research focuses on the explanation of a phenomenon observed in the spectra of electron nuclear resonance (ENDOR) pertaining to nitrogen atoms adjacent to the boron vacancy (VB) defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The phenomenon is manifested as a shift of the ENDOR spectrum lines with respect to the nitrogen Larmor frequency. It is hypothesized that these shifts are indicative of a substantial hyperfine interaction between the VB defect and the 14N nuclei in hBN. A calculation utilizing second-order perturbation theory was executed to determine the positions of the ENDOR spectrum lines, resulting in the formulation of correction equations. The values obtained from the perturbation theory corrections align well with the experimental results. The extent of nuclear state admixture into electron states was found to be around 0.04-0.07%.

Title: Strong and Tunable Electrical-Anisotropy in Type-II Weyl Semimetal Candidate WP2 with Broken Inversion Symmetry
Authors: Bo Su, Yanpeng Song, Yanhui Hou, Xu Chen, Jianzhou Zhao, Yongchang Ma, Yang Yang, Jiangang Guo, Jianlin Luo, Zhi-Guo Chen
Abstract: A transition metal diphosphide WP2 is a candidate for type-II Weyl semimetals (WSMs) in which spatial inversion symmetry is broken and Lorentz invariance is violated. As one of the key prerequisites for the presence of the WSM state in WP2, spatial inversion symmetry breaking in this compound has rarely been investigated by experiments. Furthermore, how much anisotropy the electrical properties of WP2 have and whether its electrical anisotropy can be tuned remain elusive. Here, we report angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy, electrical transport, optical spectroscopy and first-principle studies of WP2. The energies of the observed Raman-active phonons and the angle dependences of the phonon intensities are well consistent with the results obtained by first-principle calculations and the analysis of the proposed crystal symmetry without spatial inversion, providing evidence that spatial inversion symmetry is broken in WP2. Moreover, the measured ratio (Rc/Ra) between the crystalline c-axis and a-axis electrical resistivities exhibits a weak dependence on temperature from 100 to 250 K, but increases abruptly below 100 K, and then reaches the value of 8.0 at 10 K, which is by far the strongest in-plane electrical resistivity anisotropy among the reported type-II WSM candidates with comparable carrier concentrations. Our optical-spectroscopy and calculation studies reveal that the abrupt enhancement of the Rc/Ra below 100 K mainly arises from a sharp increase in the scattering rate anisotropy at low temperatures. More interestingly, the Rc/Ra at 10 K can be tuned from 8.0 to 10.6 as the magnetic field increases from 0 to 9 T. The stronge and tunable electrical resistivity anisotropy found in WP2 can serve as a degree of freedom for tuning the electrical properties of type-II WSMs, which paves the way for developing novel electronic applications based on type-II WSMs.

Title: Chiral Topological Phononic Quasiparticles in Enantiomeric Crystals SrSi$_2$ and BaSi$_2$
Authors: Yong-Kun Wang, An-Dong Fan, Jin-Yang Li, Huaqing Huang, Si Li
Abstract: Chiral crystals have recently garnered significant interest in condensed matter physics due to their unique electronic and optical properties. In this paper, we explore the connection between the chirality of crystal structures and the chirality of topological quasiparticles. We specifically predict and analyze several chiral enantiomeric materials, such as SrSi$_2$ and BaSi$_2$, which crystallize in the chiral space groups $P4{_3}32$ and $P4{_1}32$. Based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that the phonon spectra of these materials host various topological phononic quasiparticles, including charge-2 triple points, charge-2 Dirac points, charge-2 Weyl points, and charge-1 Weyl points. Our paper shows that in these enantiomeric materials, the opposite chirality of the crystal structure results in topological quasiparticles with opposite chiral topological charges and distinct topological surface states. Our paper elucidates the intrinsic relationship between the chirality of crystal structures and the chirality of topological quasiparticles, providing promising theoretical guidance and material platform for investigating the physical properties of chiral crystals.

Title: Breakdown of Magic Numbers in Spherical Confinement
Authors: Junwei Wang, Jonathan Martín-González, Lukas Römling, Silvan Englisch, Chrameh Fru Mbah, Praveen Bommineni, Erdmann Spiecker, Michael Engel, Nicolas Vogel
Abstract: Magic numbers in finite particle systems correspond to specific system sizes that allow configurations with low free energy, often exhibiting closed surface shells to maximize the number of nearest neighbors. Since their discovery in atomic nuclei, magic numbers have been essential for understanding the number-structure-property relationship in finite clusters across different scales. However, as system size increases, the significance of magic numbers diminishes, and the precise system size at which magic number phenomena disappear remains uncertain. In this study, we investigate colloidal clusters formed through confined self-assembly. Small magic number clusters display icosahedral symmetry with closed surface shells, corresponding to pronounced free energy minima. Our findings reveal that beyond a critical system size, closed surface shells disappear, and free energy minima become less pronounced. Instead, we observe a distinct type of colloidal cluster, termed football cluster, which retains icosahedral symmetry but features lower-coordinated facets disconnected by terraces. A sphere packing model demonstrates that forming closed surface shells becomes impossible beyond a critical system size, explaining the breakdown of magic numbers in large confined systems.

Title: Probing the many-body localized spin-glass phase through quench dynamics
Authors: Pietro Brighi, Marko Ljubotina, Maksym Serbyn
Abstract: Eigenstates of quantum many-body systems are often used to define phases of matter in and out of equilibrium; however, experimentally accessing highly excited eigenstates is a challenging task, calling for alternative strategies to dynamically probe nonequilibrium phases. In this work, we characterize the dynamical properties of a disordered spin chain, focusing on the spin-glass regime. Using tensor-network simulations, we observe oscillatory behavior of local expectation values and bipartite entanglement entropy. We explain these oscillations deep in the many-body localized spin glass regime via a simple theoretical model. From perturbation theory, we predict the timescales up to which our analytical description is valid and confirm it with numerical simulations. Finally, we study the correlation length dynamics, which, after a long-time plateau, resumes growing in line with renormalization group (RG) expectations. Our work suggests that RG predictions can be quantitatively tested against numerical simulations and experiments, potentially enabling microscopic descriptions of dynamical phases in large systems.

Title: Superconducting Diode Effect in Selectively-Grown Topological Insulator based Josephson Junctions
Authors: Gerrit Behner, Abdur Rehman Jalil, Detlev Grützmacher, Thomas Schäpers
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect, where the critical current magnitude depends on its direction, arises when both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken - often achieved by a combination of spin-orbit interaction and applied magnetic fields. Taking advantage of the strong spin-orbit coupling inherent in three-dimensional topological insulators, we study this phenomenon in Nb/Bi$_{0.8}$Sb$_{1.2}$Te$_3$/Nb Josephson weak-link junctions. Under an in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the current direction, we observe a pronounced Josephson diode effect with efficiencies up to 7%. A crucial component of this behavior is the non-sinusoidal current-phase relationship and an anomalous phase shift, which we attribute to the presence of a ballistic supercurrent component due to the surface states. These findings open up new avenues for harnessing and controlling the Josephson diode effect in topological material systems.

Title: Demonstration of the third-order nonlinear Hall effect in topological Dirac semimetal NiTe$_2$
Authors: V.D. Esin, A.V. Timonina, N.N. Kolesnikov, E.V. Deviatov
Abstract: We experimentally investigate third-order nonlinear Hall effect for three-dimensional NiTe$_2$ single crystal samples. NiTe$_2$ is the recently discovered type-II Dirac semimetal, so both the inversion and the time-reversal symmetries are conserved in the bulk. As a result, the well known second-order nonlinear Hall effect does not expected for this material, which we confirm as negligibly small second-harmonic transverse Hall voltage response to the longitudinal ac electric current. As the main experimental result, we demonstrate the unsaturated third-harmonic Hall response in NiTe$_2$, which well corresponds to the theoretically predicted third-order nonlinear Hall effect in Dirac semimetals. We also demonstrate, that the third harmonic signal does not depend on the external magnetic field, in contrast to the field-depended first-order and second-order Hall effects.

Title: Identification of orbital pumping from spin pumping and rectification effects
Authors: Nils Keller, Arnab Bose, Nozomi Soya, Elias Hauth, Fabian Kammerbauer, Rahul Gupta, Hiroki Hayashi, Hisanobu Kashiki, Gerhard Jakob, Sachin Krishnia, Kazuya Ando, Mathias Kläui
Abstract: The recently predicted mechanism of orbital pumping enables the generation of pure orbital current from a precessing ferromagnet (FM) without the need for electrical current injection. This orbital current can be efficiently injected into an adjacent nonmagnetic material (NM) without being hampered by electrical conductivity mismatch. However, experimentally identifying this novel effect presents significant challenges due to the substantial background contributions from spin pumping and spin rectification effects (SREs). In this work, we disentangle the effects of orbital pumping from spin pumping in bilayer structures composed of Nb/Ni and Nb/$\mathrm{Fe_{60}Co_{20}B_{20}}$ by observing a sign reversal of the measured voltage. This reversal arises from the competing signs of the spin and orbital Hall effects in the Nb. We establish methods to differentiate the pumping signal from SREs by analyzing the distinct angular dependence of the measured voltage and its spatial dependence relative to the radio frequency excitation source.

Title: Superconductivity near an Ising nematic quantum critical point in two dimensions
Authors: Jie Huang, Zhao-Kun Yang, Jing-Rong Wang, Guo-Zhu Liu
Abstract: Near a two-dimensional Ising-type nematic quantum critical point, the quantum fluctuations of the nematic order parameter are coupled to the electrons, leading to non-Fermi liquid behavior and unconventional superconductivity. The interplay between these two effects has been extensively studied through the Eliashberg equations for the superconducting gap. However, previous studies often rely on various approximations that may introduce uncertainties in the results. Here, we revisit this problem without these approximations and examine how their removal changes the outcomes. We numerically solve four self-consistent Eliashberg integral equations of the mass renormalization $A_{1}(p)$, the chemical potential renormalization $A_{2}(p)$, the pairing function $\Phi(p)$, and the nematic self-energy (polarization) function $\Pi(q)$ using the iteration method. Our calculations retain the explicit non-linearity and the full momentum dependence of these equations. We find that discarding some commonly used approximations allows for a more accurate determination of the superconducting gap $\Delta = \Phi/A_{1}$ and the critical temperature $T_{c}$. The Eliashberg equations have two different convergent gap solutions: an extended $s$-wave gap and a $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave gap. The latter is fragile, whereas the former is robust against small perturbations.

Title: Beyond the orbitally-resolved magnetic exchange in CrI$_{3}$ and NiI$_{2}$
Authors: Denis Šabani (1), Cihan Bacaksız (1), Milorad V. Milošević (1) ((1) University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium)
Abstract: The pertinent need for microscopic understanding of magnetic exchange motivated us to go beyond the existing theories and develop a systematic method to quantify all possible mechanisms that contribute to magnetic exchange for an arbitrary pair of atoms in a given material. We apply it to the archetypal 2D magnetic monolayers CrI3 and NiI2, to reveal the previously underrated dx2-y2,dx2-y2 contribution as either the leading or the second largest contribution to the total magnetic exchange. We proceed to explore the microscopic mechanisms behind all the non-zero orbital contributions in both CrI3 and NiI2, and generalize the findings to other magnetic monolayers dominated by d8 and d3 electronic configurations of the magnetic atoms.

Title: Chiral breakdown engineered by mesoscale Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in biaxial magnetic nanotubes
Authors: Kostiantyn V. Yershov, Svitlana Kondovych, Denis D. Sheka
Abstract: Curvilinear geometries in magnetic nanostructures provide a unique platform for exploring the interplay of symmetry, topology, and curvature in magnetization dynamics. In this work, we analytically study the static and dynamic properties of domain walls in biaxial magnetic nanotubes with intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction of different symmetries. We show that geometry-driven local and nonlocal interactions govern domain profiles and dynamics, enabling precise control over the wall propagation and Walker breakdown field. Furthermore, the combination of bulk-type Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and curvature leads to chirality symmetry breaking and chiral breakdown in domain wall motion. These findings offer a framework for tailoring domain wall textures in cylindrical nanotubes, unlocking new functionalities for advanced applications in curvilinear magnonics and data storage technologies.

Title: Angular dependent ferromagnetic resonance of exfoliated yttrium iron garnet film under stress
Authors: Yufeng Wang, Peng Zhou, Shuai Liu, Yajun Qi, Tianjin Zhang
Abstract: Yttrium iron garnet (Y3Fe5O12, YIG) plays a significant role in the field of spintronics due to its low magnetic damping and insulating characteristics. However, most studies have focused on YIG in bulk form or as film grown on rigid substrates. In this study, YIG film has been exfoliated from two-layer-graphene covered (111) Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG) substrate. Magnetic properties of YIG film under stress are investigated in detail via angular dependent ferromagnetic resonance. The relationship between magnetic parameters and compressive/tensile stress has been established. The findings of this work will be beneficial for the applications of flexible YIG film.

Title: Dendrite suppression in fast-charging high-energy metal-ion batteries: a Bayesian optimization approach
Authors: Hamed Taghavian, Viktor Vanoppen, Erik Berg, Peter Broqvist, Jens Sjölund
Abstract: Metal anodes provide the highest possible energy density in batteries. However, challenges associated with electrode/electrolyte interface side reactions and dendrite growth remain unsolved, especially under fast-charging conditions. In this paper, we consider a phase-field model of electrodeposition and optimize its parameters for suppressing dendrite growth and accelerating charging speed under constant voltage. We identify interfacial mobility as a key parameter, which should be maximized to inhibit dendrites without compromising the charging speed. The proposed approach provides a versatile tool for designing battery cells by optimizing an arbitrary objective function using an arbitrary set of parameters. This approach is based on Bayesian optimization and explores the parameters space with a high sample efficiency and a low computation complexity. The results are verified using extended simulations of dendrite evolution in charging half cells with lithium-metal anodes.

Title: Emergent dimer-model topological order and quasi-particle excitations in liquid crystals: combinatorial vortex lattices
Authors: Cuiling Meng, Jin-Sheng Wu, Žiga Kos, Jörn Dunkel, Cristiano Nisoli, Ivan I. Smalyukh
Abstract: Liquid crystals have proven to provide a versatile experimental and theoretical platform for studying topological objects such as vortices, skyrmions, and hopfions. In parallel, in hard condensed matter physics, the concept of topological phases and topological order has been introduced in the context of spin liquids to investigate emergent phenomena like quantum Hall effects and high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we bridge these two seemingly disparate perspectives on topology in physics. Combining experiments and simulations, we show how topological defects in liquid crystals can be used as versatile building blocks to create complex, highly degenerate topological phases, which we refer to as 'Combinatorial Vortex Lattices' (CVLs). CVLs exhibit extensive residual entropy and support locally stable quasi-particle excitations in the form of charge-conserving topological monopoles, which can act as mobile information carriers and be linked via Dirac strings. CLVs can be rewritten and reconfigured on demand, endowed with various symmetries, and modified through laser-induced topological surgery - an essential capability for information storage and retrieval. We demonstrate experimentally the realization, stability, and precise optical manipulation of CVLs, thus opening new avenues for understanding and technologically exploiting higher-hierarchy topology in liquid crystals and other ordered media.

Title: Optimization of magnetic contrast layer for neutron reflectometry
Authors: Anton Zubayer, Fredrik Eriksson, Naureen Ghafoor, Jochen Stahn, Jens Birch, Artur Glavic
Abstract: Neutron reflectivity is a powerful technique for probing density profiles in films, with applications across Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. However, challenges arise when dealing with samples characterized by high roughness, unknown scattering length density (SLD) with low contrast, very thin layers, or complex multi-layered structures, that cannot be uniquely resolved due to the phase problem. Incorporating a magnetic reference layer (MRL) and using polarized neutron reflectivity improves sensitivity and modeling accuracy by providing complementary information. In this study, we introduce a quantitative way to compare MRL systems in a model-free way. We apply this approach to demonstrate that CoTi alloys offer a superior solution as an MRL compared to the commonly used Fe or Ni-based MRLs. The low nuclear and magnetic scattering length densities of CoTi significantly enhance sensitivity, making it particularly advantageous for soft matter research. Furthermore, the tunable Co vs Ti ratio allows for optimization of the SLDs to achieve maximum sensitivity, establishing CoTi as a highly effective choice for MRL applications. The applied simulation framework for optimizing MRL sensitivity to a specific materials system and research question is a generic approach that can be used prior to growing the MRL for a given experiment.

Title: Magnetic hysteresis control in thin film Fe/Si multilayers by incorporation of B4C
Authors: Anton Zubayer, Takayasu Hanashima, Jun Sugiyama, Anna David, Xianjie Liu, Naureen Ghafoor, Jochen Stahn, Artur Glavic, Yasukazu Murakami, Tamaoka Takehiro, Yuta Tomita, M. Auchi, Jens Birch, Mats Fahlman, Fredrik Eriksson
Abstract: Magnetic hysteresis properties in Fe/Si multilayers have been studied as a function of the B4C content to control magnetization amplitude, coercivity, and hysteresis tilt, properties that are beneficial to tune for advancing applications in e.g. data storage, spintronics, and sensors. With an ion-assisted magnetron sputtering technique, 35 distinct thin film multilayer samples were prepared and their magnetic and structural properties were characterized by vibrating sample magnetometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and X-ray and neutron scattering methods. Key findings indicate that adding B4C lowers the coercivity and can decrease the saturation magnetization, demonstrating the tunability of magnetic responses based on composition. For samples with =30Å periodicity, 10-15% of B4C addition produces antiferromagnetically (AF) coupled multilayers, and such AF coupling strength increases with the B4C content. Our findings reveal that B atoms do not chemically bind within the Fe atoms but instead occupy interstitial positions, disrupting medium- to long-range crystallinity thereby inducing the amorphization. Thereon, the observed effects on magnetic properties are directly attributed to this amorphization process caused by the presence of B4C. The demonstrated ability to finely adjust magnetic properties by varying the B4C content offers a promising approach to overcome challenges in magnetic device performance and efficiency.

Title: Skyrmion motion in a synthetic antiferromagnet driven by asymmetric spin wave emission
Authors: Christopher E. A. Barker, Charles Parton-Barr, Christopher H. Marrows, Olga Kazakova, Craig Barton
Abstract: Skyrmions have been proposed as new information carriers in racetrack memory devices. To realise such devices, a small size; high speed of propagation; and minimal skyrmion Hall angle are required. Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) present the ideal materials system to realise these aims. In this work, we use micromagnetic simulations to propose a new method for manipulating them using exclusively global magnetic fields. An out-of-plane microwave field induces oscillations in the skyrmions radius which in turn emits spin waves. When a static in-plane field is added, this breaks the symmetry of the skyrmions and causes asymmetric spin wave emission. This in turn drives motion of the skyrmions, with the fastest velocities observed at the frequency of the intrinsic out-of-phase breathing mode of the pair of skyrmions. This behaviour is investigated over a range of experimentally realistic antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange coupling strengths, and the results compared to previous works studying similar motion driven with an oscillating electric field. Through this the true effect of varying the exchange coupling strength is determined, and greater insight is gained into the mechanism of skyrmion motion. These results will help to inform the design of future novel computing architectures based on the dynamics of skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets.

Title: Thermal behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates of polar molecules
Authors: Juan Sánchez-Baena, Gerard Pascual, Raúl Bombín, Ferran Mazzanti, Jordi Boronat
Abstract: We use the finite-temperature extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation (TeGPE) to study a condensate of dipolar NaCs molecules under the conditions of the very recent, breakthrough experiment [Bigagli this http URL., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. We report the condensate fraction of the system, and its density profile after a time-of flight expansion for the coldest experimental case, finding excellent agreement with the experimental measurements. We also report the peak density of the ground state and establish a comparison with the experimental estimates. Our results, derived from the TeGPE formalism, successfully describe the Bose-Einstein condensation of polar molecules at finite temperature.

Title: Metamagnetic quantum criticality in the antiferromagnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$
Authors: Tithiparna Das, Soumik Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: Combining transport and magnetization measurements, we discover the emergence of a tricritical point connecting the antiferromagnetic, metamagnetic and paramagnetic regions in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, a magnetic topological insulator candidate which can potentially exhibit axion electrodynamics. We observe a unique magnetic field-driven phase diagram where the second-order antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase boundary bifurcates into two first-order lines at the tricritical point. The two first-order lines enclosing the metamagnetic phase eventually terminate at the quantum critical endpoints with the application of magnetic field.

Title: Tuning the chiral orbital currents in a colossal magnetoresistive nodal line ferrimagnet
Authors: Arnab Das, Soumik Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: The ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ exhibits colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) owing to the chiral orbital currents (COC). The COC is developed due to spin-orbit interaction (SOI) attributed to the tellurium (Te) atoms. Here, we observe that on chemical substitution of the Te atoms with selenium (Se), the COC, which runs along the Te-Te edges of the MnTe$_6$ octahedra, becomes weaker and thus affects the angular magnetoresistance (MR) of Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. We find that the application of magnetic field along the easy axis leads to a considerable drop in resistance in substituted crystals, which otherwise exhibits weak MR. On the other hand, the CMR effect along the partially polarized magnetization direction is found to be only marginally affected due to the substitution and persists even for a significantly high concentration of Se.

Title: Kitaev-Ising-$J_1$-$J_2$ model: a density matrix renormalization group study
Authors: A. V. Kapranov, R. S. Akzyanov
Abstract: We numerically study the Kitaev honeycomb model with the additional XX Ising interaction between the nearest and the next nearest neighbors (Kitaev-Ising-$J_1$-$J_2$ model), by using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. Such additional interaction correspond to the nearest and diagonal interactions on the square lattice. Phase diagram of the bare Kitaev model consist of low entangled commensurate magnetic phases and entagled Kitaev spin liquid. Anisotropic Ising interaction allows the entangled incommensurate magnetic phases in the phase diagram, which previously was predicted only for more complex type of interactions. We study the scaling law of the entanglement entropy and the bond dimension of the matrix product state with the size of the system. In addition, we propose an optimization algorithm to prevent DMRG from getting stuck in the low-entangled phases.

Title: Multicomponent one-dimensional quantum droplets across the mean-field stability regime
Authors: I. A. Englezos, P. Schmelcher, S. I. Mistakidis
Abstract: The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.

Title: Full-cycle device-scale simulations of memory materials with a tailored atomic-cluster-expansion potential
Authors: Yuxing Zhou, Daniel F. Thomas du Toit, Stephen R. Elliott, Wei Zhang, Volker L. Deringer
Abstract: Computer simulations have long been key to understanding and designing phase-change materials (PCMs) for memory technologies. Machine learning is now increasingly being used to accelerate the modelling of PCMs, and yet it remains challenging to simultaneously reach the length and time scales required to simulate the operation of real-world PCM devices. Here, we show how ultra-fast machine-learned interatomic potentials, based on the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) framework, enable simulations of PCMs reflecting applications in devices with excellent scalability on high-performance computing platforms. We report full-cycle simulations -- including the time-consuming crystallisation process (from digital "zeroes" to "ones") -- thus representing the entire programming cycle for cross-point memory devices. We also showcase a simulation of full-cycle operations, relevant to neuromorphic computing, in a mushroom-type device geometry. Our work provides a springboard for the atomistic modelling of PCM-based memory and neuromorphic computing devices -- and, more widely, it illustrates the power of highly efficient ACE ML models for materials science and engineering.

Title: Ferromagnetic Resonance in a Magnetically Dilute Percolating Ferromagnet: An Experimental and Theoretical Study
Authors: Y.K. Edathumkandy, K. Das, K. Gas, D. Sztenkiel, D. Hommel, H. Przybylińska, M. Sawicki
Abstract: Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) serves as a powerful probe of magnetization dynamics and anisotropy in percolating ferromagnets, where short-range interactions govern long-range magnetic order. We apply this approach to Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N ($x \simeq 8$), a dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor, combining FMR and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. Our results confirm the percolative nature of ferromagnetism in (Ga,Mn)N, with a Curie temperature $T_{\mathrm{C}} = 12$ K, and reveal that despite magnetic dilution, key features of conventional ferromagnets are retained. FMR measurements establish a robust uniaxial anisotropy, dictated by Mn$^{3+}$ single-ion anisotropy, with an easy-plane character at low Mn content. While excessive line broadening suppresses FMR signals below 9 K, they persist up to 70 K, indicating the presence of non-percolating ferromagnetic clusters well above $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. The temperature dependence of the FMR intensity follows that of the magnetization, underscoring the stability of these clusters. Analysis of the FMR linewidth provides insights into relaxation processes, revealing large Gilbert damping due to the low magnetization of the system. Strikingly, atomistic spin model simulations reproduce the experimentally observed resonance fields, anisotropy trends, and linewidth evolution with remarkable accuracy. This agreement underscores the predictive power of our modeling approach in describing percolating ferromagnets. This study advances the understanding of percolating ferromagnetic systems, demonstrating that FMR is a key technique for probing their unique dynamic and anisotropic properties. Our findings contribute to the broader exploration of dilute ferromagnets and provide new insights into percolating ferromagnetic systems, which will be relevant for spintronic opportunities.

Title: Acceleration of crystal structure relaxation with Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Elena Trukhan, Efim Mazhnik, Artem R. Oganov
Abstract: We introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model for the structure relaxation of crystal materials and compare different types of neural network architectures and reinforcement learning algorithms for this purpose. Experiments are conducted on Al-Fe structures, with potential energy surfaces generated using EAM potentials. We examine the influence of parameter settings on model performance and benchmark the best-performing models against classical optimization algorithms. Additionally, the model's capacity to generalize learned interaction patterns from smaller atomic systems to more complex systems is assessed. The results demonstrate the potential of DRL models to enhance the efficiency of structure relaxation compared to classical optimizers.

Title: Amoeboid propulsion of active solid bodies, vesicles and droplets: a comparison
Authors: Reiner Kree, Annette Zippelius
Abstract: We present a unified discussion of three types of near-spherical amoeboid microswimmers, driven by periodic, axially symmetric, achiral deformations (swim strokes): a solid deformable body, a vesicle with incompressible fluid membrane, and a droplet. Minimal models are used, which characterize the swimmer type only by boundary conditions. We calculate the swimming velocities, the dissipated power and the Lighthill efficiencies within a second order perturbation expansion in the small deformation amplitudes. %Our approach uses spherical harmonics to represent surface deformations and a system of general solutions of the Stokes equation based on vector spherical harmonics. For solid bodies, we reproduce older results by Lighthill and Blake, for vesicles and for droplets we add new results. The unified approach allows for a detailed comparison between the three types of microswimmers. We present such comparisons for swim strokes made up of spherical harmonics of adjacent orders $l$ and $l+1$, as well as for a manifold of swim strokes, made up of spherical harmonics up to order $l=4$, which respect volume- and surface-incompressibility. This manifold is two-dimensional, which allows to present swimming velocities and efficiencies in a compact graphical form. In a race in which each swimmer can choose the stroke that maximizes its speed, the droplet always comes in first, the vesicle comes in second, while the particle finishes third. However, if the three swimmers perform the same stroke, other order of rankings become possible. The maximum of the total efficiency of a droplet is greater than that of a vesicle if the internal dissipation is small. The efficiency of the solid body turns out to be typically two orders of magnitude smaller than that of vesicles and droplets. Optimizing the Lighthill efficiency and optimizing the swimming velocity result in different optimal swim strokes

Title: Interlayer interactions in $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ under pressure: from $s^{\pm}$ to $d_{xy}$-wave superconductivity
Authors: Lauro B. Braz, George B. Martins, Luis G. G. V. Dias da Silva
Abstract: We investigate the role of \emph{interlayer} interaction terms in the competition between different superconducting gap symmetries in the bilayer nickelate $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ under high pressure. We study a two-layer, two-orbital electron model that encompasses both intra- and interlayer Coulomb interaction terms within the matrix random-phase approximation. We find that interlayer interactions favor a $d_{xy}$-wave superconducting pairing symmetry over the $s^{\pm}$-wave symmetry, which has been found to prevail when interlayer interactions are disregarded. Moreover, our findings indicate that interlayer interactions enhance the interorbital pairing, incorporating contributions from all three electron pockets, arising from both $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character, resulting in nodes within the gap function (not present in the $s^{\pm}$-wave state) and consequently favoring the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing.

Title: Microscopic mechanism of electric field-induced superconductivity suppression in metallic thin films
Authors: Alessio Zaccone, Giovanni A. Ummarino, Alessandro Braggio, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: Supercurrent field-effect transistors made from thin metallic films are a promising option for next-generation high-performance computation platforms. Despite extensive research, there is still no complete quantitative microscopic explanation for how an external DC electric field suppresses superconductivity in thin films. This study aims to provide a quantitative description of superconductivity as a function of film thickness based on Eliashberg's theory. The calculation considers the electrostatics of the electric field, its realistic penetration depth in the film, and its effect on the Cooper pair, which is described as a standard s-wave bound state according to BCS theory. The estimation suggests that an external electric field of approximately $10^8$ V/m is required to suppress superconductivity in 10-30-nm-thick films, which aligns with experimental observations. Ultimately, the study offers "materials by design" guidelines for suppressing supercurrent when an external electric field is applied to the film surface. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be easily extended to investigate the same effects for ultrathin films.

Title: Screening and localization in the nonlinear Anderson problem
Authors: Alexander V. Milovanov, Alexander Iomin
Abstract: We resolve an existing question concerning the localization of a wave packet by random potential in the presence of weak nonlinearity. The problem has gained considerable interest in the literature, and it continues to attract attention due to its connection with the general properties of behavior of systems with competition between nonlinearity, nonlocality and randomness. We find that the nonlinearly localized state occurs through a finite polarization response from the lattice well beyond the assumptions of a perturbation-theory approach. For the vanishing polarization response the nonlinear localization length diverges permitting unlimited spreading of the nonlinear field.

Abstract: In this study, we implement thiol termination on the surface of few-nanometer-sized silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles (NPs) to enable further applications, such as fluorescent biomarkers. Various spectroscopic techniques are employed to monitor the effectiveness of the surface treatment. Additionally, a thiol-Michael addition reaction is performed by conjugating 4-arm PEG-maleimide molecules to the thiol groups of SiC NPs, further demonstrating the reactivity of thiol-terminated SiC NPs. These thiolated SiC NPs, both with and without conjugated molecules, open new avenues in biotechnology.

Title: Highly efficient field-free switching by orbital Hall torque in a MoS2-based device operating at room temperature
Authors: Antonio Bianco, Michele Ceccardi, Raimondo Cecchini, Daniele Marre', Chanchal K. Barman, Fabio Bernardini, Alessio Filippetti, Federico Caglieris, Ilaria Pallecchi
Abstract: Charge-to-spin and spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms in high spin-orbit materials are the new frontier of memory devices. They operate via spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching of a magnetic electrode, driven by an applied charge current. In this work, we propose a novel memory device based on the semiconducting two-dimensional centrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) MoS2, that operates as a SOT device in the writing process and a spin valve in the reading process. We demonstrate that stable voltage states at room temperature can be deterministically controlled by a switching current density as low as 3.2x10^4 A/cm^2 even in zero field. An applied field 50-100 Oe can be used as a further or alternative control parameter for the state switching. Ab initio calculations of spin Hall effect (SHE) and orbital Hall effect (OHE) indicate that the latter is the only one responsible for the generation of the SOT in the magnetic electrode. The large value of OHC in bulk MoS2 makes our device competitive in terms of energetic efficiency and could be integrated in TMD heterostructures to design memory devices with multiple magnetization states for non-Boolean computation.

Title: On the crystalline environment of luminescent Tb$^{3+}$ ions embedded in indium tin oxide thin films: a DFT and Crystal field analysis assessment
Authors: E. Serquen, K. Lizárraga, L. A. Enrique, F. Bravo, S. Mishra, P. LLontop, P. Venezuela, L. R. Tessler, J. A. Guerra
Abstract: We assess the local symmetry and crystal environment of trivalent terbium ions embedded in an indium tin oxide (ITO) matrix with bixbyite structure. The \mbox{Tb$^{3+}$} ions tend to substitute \mbox{In$^{3+}$} ions in two different cationic sites ($b$ and $d$). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the \mbox{Tb$^{3+}$} ions are mainly located at $C_2$ symmetry sites relaxing selection rules and enabling electric dipole transitions, with the $^5\text{D}_4\rightarrow\leftindex^7{\text{F}}_2$ transition being the most intense, providing a red color to the light emission. Photoluminescence emission spectra under UV excitation at \qty{83}{\kelvin} revealed 30 intra-4$f$ transitions, which were assigned to the $\leftindex^7{\text{F}}_J$ ground multiplet of the \mbox{Tb$^{3+}$} ion. Crystal-field analysis shows a strong alignment between calculated and observed energy levels, yielding a standard deviation of $\sigma=\qty{15.1}{\centi\per\metre}$. We believe these results can help to understand the activation mechanisms of \mbox{Tb$^{3+}$} luminescent centers in transparent conductive oxides, as well as the potential to modulate \mbox{Tb$^{3+}$} emission color through its crystalline environment.

Title: A comprehensive approach to incorporating intermolecular dispersion into the openCOSMO-RS model. Part 2: Atomic polarizabilities
Authors: Daria Grigorash, Simon Müller, Esther Heid, Frank Neese, Dimitrios Liakos, Christoph Riplinger, Miquel García-Ratés, Patrice Paricaud, Erling H. Stenby, Irina Smirnova, Wei Yan
Abstract: openCOSMO-RS is an open-source predictive thermodynamic model that can be applied to a broad range of systems in various chemical and biochemical engineering domains. This study focuses on improving openCOSMO-RS by introducing a new dispersion term based on atomic polarizabilities. We evaluate different methods for processing polarizability data, including scaling and combining it to compute segment-segment dispersion interaction energies, with a focus on halocarbon systems. The results demonstrate that the modified model outperforms our previous method developed in the first part of this work (Grigorash et al., 2024) , while at the same time requiring fewer adjustable parameters. The approach was applied to a broad dataset of over 50,000 data points, consistently increasing the accuracy across a variety of data types. These findings suggest that atomic polarizability is a valuable descriptor for refining dispersion interactions in predictive thermodynamic models.

Title: Fine-Tuning Exciton Polaron Characteristics via Lattice Engineering in 2D Hybrid Perovskites
Authors: Katherine A Koch, Martin Gomez-Dominguez, Esteban Rojas-Gatjens, Alexander Evju, K Burak Ucer, Juan-Pablo Correa-Baena, Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada
Abstract: The layered structure of 2D metal halide perovskites (MHPs) consisting of an ionic metal halide octahedral layer electronically separated by an organic cation, exhibits strong coupling between high-binding-energy excitons and low-energy lattice phonons. Photoexcitations in these systems are believed to be exciton polarons, Coulombically bound electron-hole pairs dressed by lattice vibrations. Understanding and controlling the structural and chemical factors that govern this interaction is crucial for optimizing exciton recombination, transport, and many-body interactions. Our study examines the role of the organic cation in a prototypical 2D-MHP system, phenylethylammonium lead iodide, (PEA)2PbI4, and its halogenated derivatives, (F/Cl-PEA)2PbI4. These substitutions allow us to probe polaronic effects while maintaining the average lattice and electronic structure. Using resonant impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (RISRS), we analyze the metal-halide sub-lattice motion coupled to excitons. We apply formalism based on a perturbative expansion of the nonlinear response function on the experimental data to estimate the Huang-Rhys parameter, $S=1/2 \Delta^2$, to quantify the lattice displacement ($\Delta$) due to exciton-phonon coupling. A direct correlation emerges between lattice displacement and octahedral distortion, with F-PEA exhibiting the largest shift and Cl-PEA exhibiting the least, significantly influencing the fine structure features in absorption. Additionally, 2D electronic spectroscopy reveals that F-PEA, with the strongest polaronic coupling, exhibits the least thermal dephasing, supporting the polaronic protection hypothesis. Our findings suggest that systematic organic cation substitution serves as a tunable control for the fine structure in 2D-MHPs, and offers a pathway to mitigate many-body scattering effects by tailoring the polaronic coupling.

Title: Microscopic Origin of Reduced Magnetic Order in a Metallic Host
Authors: X. Boraley, O. Stockert, J. Lass, R. Sibille, Ø. S. Fjellvåg, S. Moody, A. M. Läuchli, V. Fritsch, D. G. Mazzone
Abstract: Although magnetic frustration in metals provides a promising avenue for novel quantum phenomena, their microscopic interpretation is often challenging. Here we use the face-centered cubic intermetallic HoInCu$_4$ as model material to show that Hamiltonians neglecting the charge degree of freedom are appropriate for frustrated metals possessing low density of states at the Fermi surface. Through neutron scattering techniques we determine matching magnetic exchange interactions in the paramagnetic and field-polarized states using an effective spin-1 Heisenberg Hamiltonian, for which we identify antiferromagnetic nearest and next-nearest neighbour interactions $J_1$ and $J_2$ that are close to the critical ratio $J_2$/$J_1$ = 1/2. The study further provides evidence that spin-wave theory fails to predict the low-energy spin dynamics in the antiferromagnetic zero-field state, which is dominated by overdamped magnetic excitations. We conclude that the low-energy fluctuations arise from quantum fluctuations, accounting for the missing moment of the strongly renormalized magnetic long-range order.

Title: A universal route from avalanches in mean-field models with random fields to stochastic Poisson branching events
Authors: Jordi Baró, Álvaro Corral
Abstract: Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.

Title: Non-Reciprocal Current-Phase Relation and Superconducting Diode Effect in Topological-Insulator-Based Josephson Junctions
Authors: A. Kudriashov, X. Zhou, R.A. Hovhannisyan, A. Frolov, L. Elesin, Y. Wang, E.V. Zharkova, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, L.A. Yashina, Z. Liu, Xin Zhou, K.S. Novoselov, D.A. Bandurin
Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJ) are essential for superconducting quantum technologies and searches of self-conjugate quasiparticles, pivotal for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Measuring the current-phase relation (CPR) in JJ based on topological insulators (TI) can provide critical insights into unconventional phenomena in these systems, such as the presence of Majorana bound states (MBS) and the nature of non-reciprocal transport. However, reconstructing CPR as a function of magnetic field in such JJs has remained experimentally challenging. Here, we introduce a platform for precise CPR measurements in planar JJs composed of NbSe$_2$ and few layer thick Bi$_2$Se$_3$ (TI) as a function of magnetic field. When a single flux quantum $\Phi_\mathrm{0}$ threads the junction, we observe anomalous peak-dip-shaped CPR behaviour and non-reciprocal supercurrent flow. We demonstrate that these anomalies stem from the edge-amplified sloped supercurrent profile rather than MBS signatures often invoked to explain puzzles emerging near $\Phi_\mathrm{0}$ in TI-based JJ. Furthermore, we show that such a supercurrent profile gives rise to a previously overlooked, robust and tunable Josephson diode effect. These findings establish field-dependent CPR measurements as a critical tool for exploring topological superconducting devices and offer new design principles for non-reciprocal superconducting electronics.

Title: Broken symmetries associated with a Kagome chiral charge order

Abstract: Chirality or handedness manifests in all fields of science, ranging from cell biology, molecular interaction, and catalysis to different branches of physics. In condensed matter physics, chirality is intrinsic to enigmatic quantum phases, such as chiral charge density waves and chiral superconductivity. Here, the underlying chiral response is subtle and leads to broken symmetries in the ground state. Detection of subtle broken symmetries is the key to understand these quantum states but they are extremely challenging to expose leading to debate and controversy. Here, using second-order optical response, we uncover the broken symmetries of a chiral charge density wave in the Kagome lattice KV3Sb5, revealing the relevant broken symmetries of its charge order. KV3Sb5 undergoes a phase transition to a charge-ordered state at low temperatures. Our polarization-dependent mid-infrared photocurrent microscopy reveals an intrinsic, longitudinal helicity-dependent photocurrent associated with the charge order. Our measurements, supported by our theoretical analysis, provide direct evidence for broken inversion and mirror symmetries at the charge order transition, indicating a chiral charge ordered state. On the other hand, we do not observe a circular photogalvanic effect along the direction perpendicular to that of the incident light, imposing stringent constraints on the rotational and point group symmetries of the charge order. Our study not only visualizes the chiral nature of the Kagome charge order revealing its broken symmetries, but also highlights the nonlinear photogalvanic effect as a sensitive probe for detecting subtle symmetry breakings.

Title: Improved Calculation of Acoustic Deformation Potentials from First Principles
Authors: Patrick Williams, Angela Dyson
Abstract: Using density functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), the band structure, phonon dispersion and electron phonon coupling matrix were calculated for silicon (Si), diamond and cubic boron nitride (cBN). From these, the acoustic deformation potential was calculated for multiple angles between the electron and phonon wave vectors and analytic expressions for the longitudinal and acoustic modes were fit to find an average deformation potential. The ability to calculate the deformation potential from first principles allows for the scattering rates to be determined without the use of lengthy empirical methods. For Si, the numerically calculated deformation potentials are in excellent agreement with what is seen in the literature. On the other hand, the deformation potentials calculated for diamond were found to be larger than what has been seen previously, however previous calculations of transport parameters in diamond report a large range of values for scattering parameters which may be due to assumptions made in each model. Excellent agreement was also seen between the value calculated for cBN and the literature, however there are no experimental results for cBN and so this value is compared against an estimate. This shows that scattering parameters can be calculated via first principles for materials with sparse experimental data, which in turn allows for increased confidence in the output of charge transport simulations of new and emerging materials.

Title: Interacting Particle Systems Modeling Self-Propelled Motions
Authors: Saori Morimoto, Makoto Katori, Hiraku Nishimori
Abstract: In non-equilibrium statistical physics, active matters in both living and non-living systems have been extensively studied. In particular, self-propelled particle systems provide challenging research subjects in experimental and theoretical physics, since individual and collective behaviors of units performing persistent motions can not be described by usual fluctuation theory for equilibrium systems. A typical example of man-made self-propelled systems which can be easily handled in small-sized experiments is a system of camphor floats put on the surface of water. Based on the experimental and theoretical studied by Nishimori et al. (J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 86 (2017) 101012), we propose a new type of mathematical models for complex motions of camphor disks on the surface of water. In the previous mathematical models introduced by Nishimori et al. are coupled systems of the equations of motion for camphor disks described by ordinary differential equations and the partial differential equation for the concentration field of camphor molecules in water. Here we consider coupled systems of equation of motions of camphor disks and random walks representing individual camphor molecules in water. In other words, we take into account non-equilibrium fluctuations by introducing stochastic processes into the deterministic models. Numerical simulation shows that our models can represent self-propelled motions of individual camphor disk as well as repulsive interactions among them. We focus on the one-dimensional models in which viscosity is dominant, and derive a dynamical system of a camphor disk by taking the average of random variables of our stochastic system. By studying both of stochastic models and dynamical systems, we clarify the transitions between three phases of motions for a camphor disk depending on parameters.

Title: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides under finite-pulse polarized radiation
Authors: Alejandro S. Gómez, Yuriko Baba, Francisco Domínguez-Adame, Rafael A. Molina
Abstract: Recent advances in time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy have enabled access to ultrafast electron states and their spin dynamics in solids. Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides are paradigmatic two-dimensional materials where electron momentum and spin degrees of freedom are coupled, being suitable candidates for time-resolved spectroscopy studies. In this work, we present a thorough study of the electron dynamics when these materials are subject to an intense finite-pulse driving radiation. We extend the scope of the conventional Floquet engineering and rely of the so-called $t-t^{\prime}$ formalism to deal with driving fields described with two distinct time scales, namely the envelope amplitude timescale and the time period of the external field. The interplay between the finite-pulse timescales and the intrinsic properties of the electrons gives rise to transient valley polarization and dynamical modifications of band structures, revealed by the time-dependent circular dichroism of the sample.

Title: Ferri- and Ferro-Electric Switching in Spontaneously Chiral Polar Liquid Crystals
Authors: Jordan Hobbs, Calum J. Gibb, Richard J. Mandle
Abstract: The recent discovery of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking has demonstrated the possibility of discovering the exotic textures of ferromagnetic systems in liquid crystalline fluid ferro-electrics. We show that the polar smectic mesophase exhibited by the first molecule discovered to exhibit a spontaneously chiral ferroelectric nematic phase is also helical has a strongly varied textural morphology depending in its thermal history and phase ordering. Electro-optic studies demonstrate that the two spontaneously chiral phases exhibit field induced phase transitions. For the nematic variant, this process is threshold-less and has no hysteresis while for the smectic it has a clear threshold and shows hysteresis meaning this phase exhibits pseudo-ferrielectric switching, the first of its kind for ferroelectric nematic like phases. We show that helix formation can be both 1st and 2nd order but when it is 1st it is accompanied by pre-transitional helix formation in the preceding ferroelectric nematic phase.

Title: Phenothiazine-Based Self-Assembled Monolayer with Thiophene Head Groups Minimizes Buried Interface Losses in Tin Perovskite Solar Cells

Abstract: Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have revolutionized the fabrication of lead-based perovskite solar cells, but they remain underexplored in tin perovskite systems. PEDOT is the material of choice for hole-selective layers in tin perovskite solar cells (TPSCs), but presents challenges for both performance and stability. MeO-2PACz, the only SAM reported for Sn perovskites, enables device fabrication but consistently underperforms when compared to PEDOT. In this work, we identify that MeO-2PACz's limitations arise from excessively strong interactions with perovskite surface and poor lattice matching, leading to poor interface quality. To overcome these issues, we design, synthesize, and characterize a novel SAM-forming molecule called Th-2EPT. Th-2EPT optimizes coordination strength and improves lattice compatibility, contributing to the creation of a high-quality buried interface and dramatically suppressing non-radiative recombination. We used Density Functional Theory (DFT) to evaluate coordination strength and lattice compatibility, complemented by nanosecond-resolution optical characterization techniques to confirm significantly reduced interfacial recombination and enhanced carrier lifetimes in Th-2EPT-Perovskite films. With Th-2EPT, we demonstrated the first SAM-based tin perovskite solar cells to outperform PEDOT-based devices, delivering a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.2% with a DMSO-free solvent system.

Title: Chasing Charge Carriers: Diffusion Dynamics in Mixed-n Quasi-Two-Dimensional Colloidal MAPbBr3 Perovskites
Authors: Ronja Maria Piehler, Eugen Klein, Francisco M. Gomez-Campos, Oliver Kühn, Rostyslav Lesyuk, Christian Klinke
Abstract: In optoelectronic applications, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are compelling materials because of their highly tuneable and intensely competitive optical properties. Colloidal synthesis enables the controlled formation of various morphologies of MHP nanocrystals, all with different carrier properties and, hence, different optical and carrier transport behaviours. We characterized three different methylammonium lead tribromide perovskite (MAPbBr3) morphologies: nanoplatelets (NPLs), nanosheets (NSs), and nanostripes (NSTs) synthesized by hot-injection synthesis protocols with slightly different parameters. A fluorescence imaging microscope (FLIM) for time- and space-resolved measurements of the carrier migration was employed to quantify the charge carriers' migration process upon photoexcitation. The results are rationalized in the two-dimensional diffusion model framework, considering funnelling and trapping processes in mixed-n colloidal MHPs. Subdiffusion mode was found to prevail in the nanocrystals, whereby the highest carrier diffusivity was found for bulk-like NSTs, followed by layered NSs and a film of NPLs. These findings provide a better understanding of optoelectronic processes in perovskites relevant to photovoltaic and light-emitting devices.

Title: Stretching Response of a Polymer Chain with Deformable Bonds
Authors: Jie Zhu, Laurence Brassart
Abstract: The stretching response of polymer chains fundamentally determines the mechanical properties of polymer networks. In this work, we develop a statistical mechanics model that incorporates both bond stretching and bond angle deformation, enabling accurate predictions of chain behavior up to large forces. This model achieves excellent agreement with experimental data for carbon chains across all force regimes using physical parameters only. We further propose a semi-analytical deformable Freely Rotating Chain (dFRC) model, which represents the chain as a freely rotating chain with effective bond stretch and bond angle that depend on the chain stretch. We show that the dFRC model is accurate over the entire force range using the same physical parameters as the statistical model without fitting. Additionally, the dFRC model provides a direct estimate of the bond force, which is crucial to predict chain scission. By capturing key bond deformations while remaining computationally efficient, our work lays the foundation for future modeling of polymer network elasticity and failure.

Title: Nanoscale Mapping of Magnetic Orientations with Complex X-ray Magnetic Linear Dichroism
Authors: Marina Raboni Ferreira, Benedikt J. Daurer, Jeffrey Neethirajan, Andreas Apseros, Sandra Ruiz-Gómez, Burkhard Kaulich, Majid Kazemian, Claire Donnelly
Abstract: Compensated magnets are of increasing interest for both fundamental research and applications, with their net-zero magnetization leading to ultrafast dynamics and robust order. To understand and control this order, nanoscale mapping of local domain structures is necessary. One of the main routes to mapping antiferromagnetic order is X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD), which probes the local orientation of the Néel vector. However, XMLD imaging typically suffers from weak contrast and has mainly been limited to surface-sensitive techniques. Here, we harness coherent diffractive imaging to map the complex XMLD spectroscopically, and identify the phase linear dichroism as a high-contrast, high-resolution mechanism for imaging magnetic order. By applying X-ray spectroptychography to a model sample, we retrieve the full complex XMLD spectrum. Combining this with hierarchical clustering, we resolve the spatial distribution of probed domains by their distinct spectral signatures, providing a robust method for analyzing magnetic configurations with weak signals. Our results show that phase contrast is significantly stronger than the corresponding absorption contrast, offering higher spatial-resolution magnetic imaging. This approach establishes a reliable, element- and orbital-sensitive tool for studying compensated magnets.

Title: Triggered ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ from polar hybrid zone-boundary phonon instability
Authors: Seongjoo Jung, Turan Birol
Abstract: Ferroelectric HfO$_2$ has garnered significant attention for its promising application in high density nonvolatile data storage and nanoscale transistors. However, the uncertain origin of polarization in HfO$_2$ limits our ability to fully understand and control its ferroelectricity. The ongoing debate centers on whether HfO$_2$ is a proper or improper ferroelectric, as it exhibits characteristics of both types. In this study, we utilize symmetry-guided first-principles quantum mechanical (DFT) calculations to accurately map the energy landscape and identify the coherent switching pathway of HfO$_2$ by voltage. Our findings reveal two key insights. First, ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ is driven by a triggered mechanism through coupling between the stable polar mode and hybrid non-polar modes. Second, unusually high polarization arises from the hybrid modes, which consists solely of non-polar modes. The results fundamentally transforms the perspective on polarization in HfO$_2$ and resolve conflicting characteristics observed, offering valuable guidance for superior technological applications.

Title: Superconductivity of Bad Fermions: Origin of Two Gaps in HTSC Cuprates
Authors: E.A. Stepanov, S. Iskakov, M.I. Katsnelson, A.I. Lichtenstein
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of the doped ${t-t'}$ Hubbard model with parameters typical for high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Our approach is based on a novel strong-coupling Green's function expansion around a reference system -- the exactly solvable undoped particle-hole symmetric Hubbard lattice -- that possesses a large antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard-Slater gap in the electron spectrum. The electron spectral function in the case of a large next-nearest-neighbor hopping ${t'=-0.3t}$, which is characteristic of the ${T_c \approx 100\,\text{K}}$ family of cuprates, reveals a strongly renormalized flat band feature with a pseudogap around the antinodal point. The superconducting response of this system to a small ${d_{x^2-y^2}}$-like external field exhibits a very unusual form. It features a pseudogap at the antinodal point in the normal part of the Nambu Green's function, related to a ``bad-fermion'' behavior in a normal phase, as well as a ${d}$-wave-like structure in the anomalous (Gorkov's) Green's function, with zero response at the nodal point of the Brillouin zone. Remarkably, we find that the anomalous part of the response deviates essentially from the simplest ${(\cos{k_x}-\cos{k_y})}$ form in momentum space. Specifically, its extrema are shifted away from the ${(\pi,0)}$ and ${(0,\pi)}$ points due to suppression of the response by the pseudogap. The observed two-gap structure of the electron spectra in a generic strong-coupling model of cuprates can serve as a basis for phenomenological treatment of different physical properties of high-temperature superconductors within two-fluid model.

Title: Optimizing Perturbations for Improved Training of Machine Learning Models
Authors: Sagi Meir, Tommer D. Keidar, Shlomi Reuveni, Barak Hirshberg
Abstract: Machine learning models have become indispensable tools in applications across the physical sciences. Their training is often time-consuming, vastly exceeding the inference timescales. Several protocols have been developed to perturb the learning process and improve the training, such as shrink and perturb, warm restarts, and stochastic resetting. For classifiers, these perturbations have been shown to result in enhanced speedups or improved generalization. However, the design of such perturbations is usually done \textit{ad hoc} by intuition and trial and error. To rationally optimize training protocols, we frame them as first-passage processes and consider their response to perturbations. We show that if the unperturbed learning process reaches a quasi-steady state, the response at a single perturbation frequency can predict the behavior at a wide range of frequencies. We demonstrate that this is the case when training a CIFAR-10 classifier using the ResNet-18 model and use this approach to identify an optimal perturbation and frequency. Our work allows optimization of training protocols of machine learning models using a statistical mechanical approach.

Title: Correlations and Krylov spread for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian: Ising chain with a complex-valued transverse magnetic field
Authors: Edward Medina Guerra, Igor Gornyi, Yuval Gefen
Abstract: Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.

Title: Revisiting the $ϕ^6$ Theory in Three Dimensions at Large $N$
Authors: Sandra Kvedaraitė, Tom Steudtner, Max Uetrecht
Abstract: We investigate the $O(N)$--symmetric $\phi^6$ theory in three spacetime dimensions using dimensional regularisation and minimal subtraction. The predictions of other methods are scrutinised in a large-$N$ expansion. We show how the tricritical line of fixed point emerges in a strict $N\to\infty$ limit but argue that it is not a physical manifestation. For the first time in this explicit manner, we compute the effective potential at next-to-leading order in the $1/N$-expansion and discuss its stability. The Bardeen-Moshe-Bander phenomenon is also analysed at next-to-leading order, and we demonstrate that it disappears without breaking the scale invariance spontaneously. Our findings indicate that the UV fixed point found by Pisarski persists at large $N$.

Title: Automated Microsolvation for Minimum Energy Path Construction in Solution
Authors: Paul L. Türtscher, Markus Reiher
Abstract: Describing chemical reactions in solution on a molecular level is a challenging task due to the high mobility of weakly interacting solvent molecules which requires configurational sampling. For instance, polar and protic solvents can interact strongly with solutes and may interfere in reactions. However, to define and identify representative arrangements of solvent molecules modulating a transition state is a non-trivial task. Here, we propose to monitor their active participation in the decaying normal mode at a transition state, which defines active solvent molecules. Moreover, it is desirable to prepare a low-dimensional microsolvation model in a well-defined, fully automated, high-throughput, and easy-to-deploy fashion, which we propose to derive in a stepwise protocol. First, transition state structures are optimized in a sufficiently solvated quantum-classical hybrid model, which are then subjected to a re-definition of a then reduced quantum region. From the reduced model, minimally microsolvated structures are extracted that contain only active solvent molecules. Modeling the remaining solvation effects is deferred to a continuum model. To establish an easy-to-use free-energy model, we combine the standard thermochemical gas-phase model with a correction for the cavity entropy in solution. We assess our microsolvation and free-energy models for methanediol formation from formaldehyde, for the hydration of carbon dioxide (which we consider in a solvent mixture to demonstrate the versatility of our approach), and, finally, for the chlorination of phenol with hypochlorous acid.

Title: Adaptive kernel predictors from feature-learning infinite limits of neural networks
Authors: Clarissa Lauditi, Blake Bordelon, Cengiz Pehlevan
Abstract: Previous influential work showed that infinite width limits of neural networks in the lazy training regime are described by kernel machines. Here, we show that neural networks trained in the rich, feature learning infinite-width regime in two different settings are also described by kernel machines, but with data-dependent kernels. For both cases, we provide explicit expressions for the kernel predictors and prescriptions to numerically calculate them. To derive the first predictor, we study the large-width limit of feature-learning Bayesian networks, showing how feature learning leads to task-relevant adaptation of layer kernels and preactivation densities. The saddle point equations governing this limit result in a min-max optimization problem that defines the kernel predictor. To derive the second predictor, we study gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight decay in the infinite-width limit using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The fixed point equations of the arising DMFT defines the task-adapted internal representations and the kernel predictor. We compare our kernel predictors to kernels derived from lazy regime and demonstrate that our adaptive kernels achieve lower test loss on benchmark datasets.

Title: Large N vector models in the Hamiltonian framework
Authors: Diego Barberena
Abstract: We present a fluctuating $N$ formalism, based on second-quantization, to describe large $N$ vector models from field theory using Hamiltonian methods. We first present the method in the simpler setting of a quantum mechanical system with quartic interactions, and then apply these techniques to the $O(N)$ model in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. We recover various known results, such as the gap equation determining the ground state of the system, the presence of bound states at negative coupling and the leading order contribution to critical exponents, and provide an interpretation of the large $N$ path integral saddle point as a Bose-Einstein condensate of extended objects in the presence of a non-local interaction. In the large $N$ limit, this formalism leads naturally to a description of elementary $O(N)$ symmetric excitations in terms of bilocal fields, which are at the basis of $\text{AdS}_4/\text{CFT}_3$ studies of the $O(N)$ model and Vasiliev gravity.

Title: Fermionic CFTs from topological boundaries in abelian Chern-Simons theories
Authors: Kohki Kawabata, Tatsuma Nishioka, Takuya Okuda, Shinichiro Yahagi
Abstract: A quantum field theory is referred to as bosonic (non-spin) if its physical quantities are independent of the spacetime spin structure, and as fermionic (spin) if they depend on it. We explore fermionic conformal field theories (CFTs) that emerge from bosonic abelian Chern-Simons theories, playing the role of a symmetry topological field theory, by imposing topological boundary conditions. Our construction includes the fermionic generalization of code CFTs. When the Chern-Simons theory is associated with the root lattice of a simply laced Lie algebra, this approach yields a fermionic CFT with a level-one affine Lie algebra symmetry. As an application, we consider the Chern-Simons theories corresponding to a class of supersymmetric vertex operator algebras studied by Johnson-Freyd and classify their fermionic topological boundary conditions that give rise to supersymmetric CFTs.

Title: Mechano-optical metasurfaces
Authors: Freek van Gorp, Wenfeng Liu, Corentin Coulais, Jorik van de Groep
Abstract: Tunable metasurfaces enable active and on-demand control over optical wavefronts through reconfigurable scattering of resonant nanostructures. Here, we present novel insights inspired by mechanical metamaterials to achieve giant tunability in mechano-optical metasurfaces where the mechanical metamaterial and optical metasurfaces are integrated in a single nanopatterned material. In a first design, judiciously engineered cuts in a flexible substrate enable large, strain-induced extension of the inter-particle spacing, tuning a high quality-factor resonance in a silicon nanoparticle array across a very broad spectral range. In a second design, we eliminate the substrate and demonstrate a nanopatterned silicon membrane that simultaneously functions as a mechanical metamaterial and an optical metasurface with large tunability. Our results highlight a promising route toward active metasurfaces, with potential applications in tunable filters, reconfigurable lenses, and dynamic wavefront shaping.

Abstract: Phase reconstruction is important in transmission electron microscopy for structural studies. We describe electron Fourier ptychography and its application to phase reconstruction of both radiation-resistant and beam-sensitive materials. We demonstrate that the phase of the exit wave can be reconstructed at high resolution using a modified iterative phase retrieval algorithm with data collected using an alternative optical geometry. This method achieves a spatial resolution of 0.63 nm at a fluence of $4.5 \times 10^2 \, e^-/\text{nm}^2$, as validated on Cry11Aa protein crystals under cryogenic conditions. Notably, this method requires no additional hardware modifications, is straightforward to implement, and can be seamlessly integrated with existing data collection software, providing a broadly accessible approach for structural studies.

Title: Effects of correlated noise on the excitation of robust breathers in an ac-driven, lossy sine-Gordon system
Authors: Giovanni Di Fresco, Duilio De Santis, Claudio Guarcello, Bernardo Spagnolo, Angelo Carollo, Davide Valenti
Abstract: Thermal noise and harmonic forcing have recently been shown to cooperatively excite sine-Gordon breathers robust to dissipation. Such a phenomenon has been found assuming a Gaussian noise source, delta-correlated both in time and space. In light of the potential implications of this generation technique, e.g., for the experimental observation of breathers in long Josephson junctions, it is physically motivated to investigate the effects of more realistic noise sources with finite correlation time and/or correlation length. Here, breathers are demonstrated to still emerge under this broader class of noise sources. The correlation time and the correlation length are found to offer control over the probability of observing breathers, as well on the typical timescale for their emergence. In particular, our results show that, as compared to the thermal case, the temporal and spatial correlations in the noise can lead to a larger breather-only occurrence frequency, i.e., the latter quantity behaves nonmonotonically versus both the correlation time and the correlation length. Overall, noise correlations represent a powerful tool for controlling the excitation of the elusive breather modes in view of experiments.

Title: Multiplexed qubit readout quality metric beyond assignment fidelity
Authors: Andras Di Giovanni, Adrian Skasberg Aasen, Jürgen Lisenfeld, Martin Gärttner, Hannes Rotzinger, Alexey V. Ustinov
Abstract: The accurate measurement of quantum two-level objects (qubits) is crucial for developing quantum computing hardware. Over the last decade, the measure of choice for benchmarking readout routines for superconducting qubits has been assignment fidelity. However, this method only focuses on the preparation of computational basis states and therefore does not provide a complete characterization of the readout. Here, we expand the focus to the use of detector tomography to fully characterize multi-qubit readout of superconducting transmon qubits. The impact of different readout parameters on the rate of information extraction is studied using quantum state reconstruction infidelity as a proxy. The results are then compared with assignment fidelities, showing good agreement for separable two-qubit states. We therefore propose the rate of infidelity convergence as an alternative and more comprehensive benchmark for single- and multi-qubit readout optimization. We find the most effective allocation of a fixed shot budget between detector tomography and state reconstruction in single- and two-qubit experiments. To address the growing interest in three-qubit gates, we perform three-qubit quantum state tomography that goes beyond conventional readout error mitigation methods and find a factor of 30 reduction in quantum infidelity. Our results demonstrate that neither quantum nor classical qubit readout correlations are induced even by very high levels of readout noise. Consequently, correlation coefficients can serve as a valuable tool in qubit readout optimization.

Abstract: Surface effects can significantly impact the performance of nanophotonic and quantum photonic devices, especially as the device dimensions are reduced. In this work, we propose and investigate a novel approach to surface passivation to mitigate these challenges in photonic nanostructures with III-As(P) quantum wells defined by a dry etching process. The nanostructures are annealed under the phosphine (PH$_3$) ambient inside a metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy chamber to eliminate surface and subsurface defects induced during the dry etching and subsequent oxidation of the etched sidewalls. Moreover, encapsulation of the active material with a wider bandgap material allows for maintaining the band structure of the device, mitigating band bending effects. Our findings reveal an almost order of magnitude reduction in the surface recombination velocity from $2 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{cm/s}$ for the PH$_3$ annealing compared to $1.5 \times 10^4 \, \mathrm{cm/s}$ for the non-passivated structures and $5 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{cm/s}$ for the standard method based on (NH$_4$)$_2$S wet treatment followed by Al$_2$O$_3$ encapsulation. A further reduction to $5 \times 10^2 \, \mathrm{cm/s}$ is achieved for the InP-regrown samples. Additionally, we develop a model accounting for the impact of surface charges in the analysis of time-resolved photoluminescence curves and demonstrate that the proposed passivation method effectively reduces the surface charge density on the sidewalls of the studied quantum well-based photonic nanostructures.

Abstract: Rejuvenation and memory, long considered the distinguishing features of spin glasses, have recently been proven to result from the growth of multiple length scales. This insight, enabled by simulations on the Janus~II supercomputer, has opened the door to a quantitative analysis. We combine numerical simulations with comparable experiments to introduce two coefficients that quantify memory. A third coefficient has been recently presented by Freedberg et al. We show that these coefficients are physically equivalent by studying their temperature and waiting-time dependence.

Title: Intercellular Friction and Motility Drive Orientational Order in Cell Monolayers
Authors: Michael Chiang, Austin Hopkins, Benjamin Loewe, M. Cristina Marchetti, Davide Marenduzzo
Abstract: Spatiotemporal patterns in multicellular systems are important to understanding tissue dynamics, for instance, during embryonic development and disease. Here, we use a multiphase field model to study numerically the behavior of a near-confluent monolayer of deformable cells with intercellular friction. Varying friction and cell motility drives a solid-liquid transition, and near the transition boundary, we find the emergence of local nematic order of cell deformation driven by shear-aligning cellular flows. Intercellular friction contributes to the monolayer's viscosity, which significantly increases the spatial correlation in the flow and, concomitantly, the extent of nematic order. We also show that local hexatic and nematic order are tightly coupled and propose a mechanical-geometric model for the colocalization of +1/2 nematic defects and 5-7 disclination pairs, which are the structural defects in the hexatic phase. Such topological defects coincide with regions of high cell-cell overlap, suggesting that they may mediate cellular extrusion from the monolayer, as found experimentally. Our results delineate a mechanical basis for the recent observation of nematic and hexatic order in multicellular collectives in experiments and simulations and pinpoint a generic pathway to couple topological and physical effects in these systems.

Title: Kagome electronic states in gradient-strained untwisted graphene bilayers
Authors: Zeyu Liu, Xianghua Kong, Zewen Wu, Linwei Zhou, Jingsi Qiao, Wei Ji
Abstract: Moiré superlattices in twisted homo-bilayers have revealed exotic electronic states, including unconventional superconductivity and correlated insulating phases. However, their fabrication process often introduces moiré disorders, hindering reproducibility and experimental control. Here, we propose an alternative approach using gradient strain to construct moiré superlattices in untwisted bilayer graphene (gs-BLG). Through force-field and first-principles calculations, we show that gs-BLG exhibits kagome-like interlayer-spacing distributions and strain-tunable kagome electronic bands. The competition between interlayer coupling and in-plane strain relaxation leads to distinct structural deformations, giving rise to three forms of diatomic kagome lattices: subtle, pronounced, and distorted. Kagome electronic bands are identified near the Fermi level in their band structures. Modulating strain gradients enables tailoring bandwidths and signs of hopping parameters of these kagome bands, providing a versatile platform for studying exotic electronic phases. Our findings establish gradient strain as an alternative to twist engineering, opening an avenue for exploring emergent electronic phases in graphene-based systems.

Title: Spontaneous polar and chiral symmetry breaking in ordered fluids -- heliconical ferroelectric nematic phases
Authors: Jakub Karcz, Jakub Herman, Natan Rychłowicz, Przemysław Kula, Ewa Górecka, Jadwiga Szydlowska, Pawel W. Majewski, Damian Pociecha
Abstract: It is known that the chiral interaction described by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DMI) term lead to the plethora of topological structures of magnetic spins, such as helical or skyrmion phases. Here we present the that analogues electrical DMI can lead to similar structural complexity of electric dipoles in soft matter. We report on a new polar liquid phase in which achiral molecules spontaneously form a heliconical structure. The helical pitch is comparable to the wavelength of visible light and unwinds critically at the transition to a uniformly polar, ferroelectric nematic phase. Although this new liquid crystalline phase resembles the twist-bend nematic phase, the mechanism of its formation is different and is attributed to electrical interactions that cause non-collinear arrangement of electric dipoles, similarly as observed for spins in magnetic systems.

Title: Strong impact of low-level substitution of Mn by Fe on the magnetoelectric coupling in $TbMnO_{3}$
Authors: A. Maia, R. Vilarinho, P. Proschek, M. Lebeda, M. Mihalik jr., M. Mihalik, P. Manuel, D. D. Khalyavin, S. Kamba, J. Agostinho Moreira
Abstract: The correlation between static magnetoelectric coupling and magnetic structure was investigated in $TbMn_{0.98}Fe_{0.02}O_{3}$ with magnetic field up to 8 T and down to 2 K. Single-crystal neutron diffraction experiments reveal a substantial increase in the temperature dependence of the incommensurate modulation wave vector of the antiferromagnetic phase as the magnetic field strength increases. Magnetic field-dependent pyroelectric current measurements revealed significantly higher magnetoelectric coupling at magnetic fields below 4 T than in pure TbMnO3. This is due to the higher sensitivity of the incommensurably modulated cycloid structure to weak magnetic fields. Detailed analysis of our data confirmed that the ferroelectric polarization is induced by inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction for magnetic field strength up to 4 T, but at higher fields a departure from theoretical predictions is ascertained, giving evidence for an additional, as yet misunderstood, contribution to magnetoelectric coupling. It shows that a small 2% substitution of Mn3+ by Fe3+ has a strong impact on the magnetic structure, promoting the destabilization of the incommensurably modulated magnetic cycloidal structure of $TbMnO_{3}$ in a magnetic field above 5 T. We demonstrate that the magnetoelectric coupling magnitude can be tuned through suitable substitutional elements, even at low level, inducing local lattice distortions with different electronic and magnetic properties.

Title: Distinct Optical Excitation Mechanisms of a Coherent Magnon in a van der Waals Antiferromagnet
Authors: Clifford J. Allington, Carina A. Belvin, Urban F. P. Seifert, Mengxing Ye, Tommy Tai, Edoardo Baldini, Suhan Son, Junghyun Kim, Jaena Park, Je-Geun Park, Leon Balents, Nuh Gedik
Abstract: The control of antiferromagnets with ultrashort optical pulses has emerged as a prominent field of research. Tailored laser excitation can launch coherent spin waves at terahertz frequencies, yet a comprehensive description of their generation mechanisms is still lacking despite extensive efforts. Using terahertz emission spectroscopy, we investigate the generation of a coherent magnon mode in the van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$ under a range of photoexcitation conditions. By tuning the pump photon energy from transparency to resonant with a $d$-$d$ transition, we reveal a striking change in the coherent magnon's dependence on the pump polarization, indicating two distinct excitation mechanisms. Our findings provide a strategy for the manipulation of magnetic modes via photoexcitation around sub-gap electronic states.

Title: Transient dynamical phase diagram of the spin-boson model
Authors: Olga Goulko, Hsing-Ta Chen, Moshe Goldstein, Guy Cohen
Abstract: We investigate the real-time dynamics of the sub-Ohmic spin-boson model across a broad range of coupling strengths, using the numerically exact inchworm quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. From short- and intermediate-time dynamics starting from an initially decoupled state, we extract signatures of the zero-temperature quantum phase transition between localized and delocalized states. We show that the dynamical phase diagram thus obtained differs from the equilibrium phase diagram in both the values of critical couplings and the associated values of the critical exponent. We also identify and quantitatively analyze two competing mechanisms for the crossover between coherent oscillations and incoherent decay. Deep in the sub-Ohmic regime, the crossover is driven by the damping of the oscillation amplitude, while closer to the Ohmic regime the oscillation frequency itself drops sharply to zero at large coupling.

Title: Spin-Valley Protected Kramers Pair in Bilayer Graphene

Abstract: The intrinsic valley degree of freedom makes bilayer graphene (BLG) a unique platform for semiconductor qubits. The single-carrier quantum dot (QD) ground state exhibits a two-fold degeneracy, where the two states that constitute a Kramers pair, have opposite spin and valley quantum numbers. Because of the valley-dependent Berry curvature, an out-of-plane magnetic field breaks the time-reversal symmetry of this ground state and a qubit can be encoded in the spin-valley subspace. The Kramers states are protected against known spin- and valley-mixing mechanisms because mixing requires a simultaneous change of both quantum numbers. Here, we fabricate a tunable QD device in Bernal BLG and measure a spin-valley relaxation time for the Kramers states of ${38~\mathrm{s}}$, which is two orders of magnitude longer than the ${0.4~\mathrm{s}}$ measured for purely spin-blocked states. We also show that the intrinsic Kane-Mele spin-orbit splitting enables a Kramers doublet single-shot readout even at zero magnetic field with a fidelity above ${99\%}$. If these long-lived Kramers states also possess long coherence times and can be effectively manipulated, electrostatically defined QDs in BLG may serve as long-lived semiconductor qubits, extending beyond the spin qubit paradigm.

Title: Bifurcations of inflating balloons and interacting hysterons
Authors: Gentian Muhaxheri, Christian D. Santangelo
Abstract: While many materials exhibit a complex, hysteretic response to external driving, there has been a surge of interest in how the complex dynamics of internal materials states can be understood and designed to process and store information. We consider a system of connected rubber balloons that can be described by a Preisach model of non-interacting hysterons under pressure control, but for which the hysterons become coupled under volume control. We study this system by exploring the possible transition graphs, as well as by introducing a configuration space approach which tracks the volumes of each balloon. Changes in the transition graphs turn out to be related to changes in the topology of the configuration space of the balloons, providing a particularly geometric view of how transition graphs can be designed, as well as additional information on the existence of hidden metastable states. This class of systems is more general than just balloons.

Title: Strong magneto-optical responses of an ensemble of defect-bound excitons in ambient exposed WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers
Authors: Frederico B. Sousa, Alessandra Ames, Mingzu Liu, Pedro L. Gastelois, Vinícius A. Oliveira, Da Zhou, Matheus J. S. Matos, Helio Chacham, Mauricio Terrones, Marcio D. Teodoro, Leandro M. Malard
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers present a singular coupling in their spin and valley degrees of freedom. Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. This valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley characters of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayers present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting of $\approx 0.23$ meV/T. Therefore, alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses are mandatory for application purposes. Here, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of ambient exposed WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers by circularly polarized magneto-photoluminescence experiments at cryogenic temperatures. A broad lower energy photoluminescence emission related to an ensemble of defects is observed, presenting remarkable valley-related splittings of $\approx 1.45$ meV/T and $\approx 1.11$ meV/T for WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, respectively. In addition, we report a significant valley polarization of charge carriers in the defect mid-gap states induced by the external magnetic field. We explain this valley-polarized population and enhanced valley-related splitting in terms of imbalanced intervalley relaxations, leading to a magnetic field-dependent distribution of charge carriers in multiple defect levels. This effect, together with the individual Zeeman shiftings of the mid-gap states, explains the strong magneto-optical responses observed. Our work uncovers the singular potential of manipulating the light emission of ambient exposed TMD monolayers by an external magnetic field.

Title: Spectral and Entanglement Properties of the Random Exchange Heisenberg Chain
Authors: Yilun Gao, Rudolf A. Römer
Abstract: We study the many-body localization problem in the non-abelian SU(2)-invariant random antiferromagnetic exchange model in 1D. Exact and sparse matrix diagonalization methods are used to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian matrix. We investigate the behaviour of the energy level gap-ratio statistic, participation ratio, entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectral parameter as a function of disorder strength. Different distributions of random couplings are considered. We find, up to $L=24$, a clear distinction between our non-abelian model and the more often studied random field Heisenberg model: the regime of seemingly localized behaviour is much less pronounced in the random exchange model than in the field model case.

Title: Extracting work from coherence in a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: L. A. Williamson, F. Cerisola, J. Anders, Matthew J. Davis
Abstract: We show how work can be extracted from number-state coherence in a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate. With careful tuning of parameters, a sequence of thermodynamically reversible steps transforms a Glauber coherent state into a thermal state with the same energy probability distribution. The work extracted during this process arises entirely from the removal of quantum coherence. More generally, we characterise quantum (from coherence) and classical (remaining) contributions to work output, and find that in this system the quantum contribution can be dominant over a broad range of parameters. The proportion of quantum work output can be further enhanced by squeezing the initial state. Due to the many-body nature of the system, the work from coherence can equivalently be understood as work from entanglement.

Title: Rabi and Ramsey oscillations of a Majorana qubit in a quantum dot-superconductor array
Authors: Haining Pan, Sankar Das Sarma, Chun-Xiao Liu
Abstract: The Kitaev chain can be engineered within a quantum dot-superconductor array, hosting Majorana zero modes at fine-tuned sweet spots. In this work, we propose and simulate the occurrence of Rabi and Ramsey oscillations to feasibly construct a minimal Majorana qubit in the quantum dot setup. Our real-time results incorporate realistic effects, e.g., charge noise and leakage, reflecting the latest experimental progress. We demonstrate that Majorana qubits with larger energy gaps exhibit significantly enhanced performance -- longer dephasing times, higher quality factors, reduced leakage probabilities, and improved visibilities -- compared to those with smaller gaps and with conventional quantum dot-based charge qubits. We introduce a method for reading out Majorana qubits via quantum capacitance measurements. Our work paves the way for future experiments on realizing Majorana qubits in quantum dot-superconductor arrays.

Title: Generalized Josephson effect with arbitrary periodicity in quantum magnets
Authors: Anshuman Tripathi, Felix Gerken, Peter Schmitteckert, Michael Thorwart, Mircea Trif, Thore Posske
Abstract: Easy-plane quantum magnets are strikingly similar to superconductors, allowing for spin supercurrent and an effective superconducting phase stemming from their $U(1)$ rotation symmetry around the $z$-axis. We uncover a generalized fractional Josephson effect with a periodicity that increases linearly with system size in one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ chains at selected anisotropies and phase-fixing boundary fields. The effect combines arbitrary integer periodicities in a single system, exceeding the $4\pi $ and $8\pi $ periodicity of superconducting Josephson effects of Majorana zero modes and other exotic quasiparticles. We reveal a universal energy-phase relation and connect the effect to the recently discovered phantom helices.

Title: Dynamical kinetic energy quenching in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metals
Authors: Anton Borissov, Vladimir Calvera, Sung-Sik Lee
Abstract: We study the dynamics of critical spin fluctuations and hot electrons at the metallic antiferromagnetic quantum critical points with $Z_2$ and $O(2)$ spin symmetries, building upon earlier works on the $O(3)$ symmetric theory. The interacting theories in $2+1$ dimensions are approached from $3+1$-dimensional theories in the $\epsilon$-expansion that tunes the co-dimension of Fermi surface as a control parameter. The low-energy physics of the $Z_2$ and $O(2)$ theories qualitatively differ from each other and also from that of the $O(3)$ theory. The difference is caused by higher-order quantum corrections beyond the one-loop order that are important even to the leading order in $\epsilon$. The naive loop-expansion breaks down due to dynamical quenching of kinetic energy: the speed of the collective mode ($c$) and the Fermi velocity perpendicular to the magnetic ordering vector ($v$) become vanishingly small at low energies. What sets the three theories apart is the hierarchy that emerges between the quenched kinetic terms. At the infrared fixed point, $c/v$ becomes $0$, $1$ and $\infty$ in the $Z_2$, $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ theories, respectively. At intermediate energy scales, the slow renormalization group (RG) flows of $c$ and $v$ toward their fixed point values create approximate scale invariance controlled by approximate marginal parameters. The manifold of those quasi-fixed points and the RG flow therein determines crossovers from scaling behaviours with transient critical exponents at intermediate energy scales to the universal scaling in the low-energy limit. If the symmetry group is viewed as a tuning parameter, the $O(2)$ theory corresponds to a multi-critical point which has one additional quasi-marginal parameter than the other two theories.

Title: Possible Fano effect and suppression of Andreev reflection in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Yi-feng Yang
Abstract: The recently-discovered high-temperature superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has stimulated intensive debates. Key controversies concern interlayer versus intralayer pairing scenarios and if the hybridization plays a key role in establishing the superconductivity. But experimental clarification is difficult due to the limitation of employing state-of-the-art techniques under high pressure. Here we propose that quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev reflection may provide a feasible way to distinguish different pairing scenarios. We predict that an asymmetric Fano line shape may be induced by the hybridization between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ metallic bands and the strongly renormalized flat $d_{z^2}$ quasiparticle bands. In the superconducting state, we show that the Andreev reflection should be greatly suppressed for interlayer pairing superconductivity with a small interlayer hopping. We propose future experiments to examine these predictions and help clarify the fundamental physics of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and other multilayer nickelate superconductors.

Title: Attractive and repulsive terms in multi-object dispersion interactions
Authors: Subhojit Pal, Barry W. Ninham, John F. Dobson, Mathias Boström
Abstract: Filamentary objects such as nano-wires, nanotubes and DNA are of current interest in physics, nanoscience, chemistry, biology and medicine. They can interact via exceptionally long-ranged many-object van der Waals (vdW, dispersion) forces, causing them to cluster into multi-object bundles. We analyse their vdW interactions quantitatively, predicting $N$-object vdW energy contributions that alternate in sign with increasing $N$. We also provide novel insights permitting these tendencies to be understood simply in terms of electronic screening and anti-screening. Relevant systems include polyelectrolyte double layers, Nafion exclusion zone, endothelial surface layer of cells, microemulsion interfaces and hexagonal phases, salt fingers in Gibbs Marangoni effects, myosin fibres in muscle, multiple nanotubes in the interior of neuronal axons, and carbon fibre materials.

Title: Experimental online quantum dots charge autotuning using neural networks

Abstract: Spin-based semiconductor qubits hold promise for scalable quantum computing, yet they require reliable autonomous calibration procedures. This study presents an experimental demonstration of online single-dot charge autotuning using a convolutional neural network integrated into a closed-loop calibration system. The autotuning algorithm explores the gates' voltage space to localize charge transition lines, thereby isolating the one-electron regime without human intervention. This exploration leverages the model's uncertainty estimation to find the appropriate gate configuration with minimal measurements while reducing the risk of failures. In 20 experimental runs, our method achieved a success rate of 95% in locating the target electron regime, highlighting the robustness of this approach against noise and distribution shifts from the offline training set. Each tuning run lasted an average of 2 hours and 9 minutes, primarily due to the limited speed of the current measurement. This work validates the feasibility of machine learning-driven real-time charge autotuning for quantum dot devices, advancing the development toward the control of large qubit arrays.

Title: Altermagnetism Classification
Authors: Sang-Wook Cheong, Fei-Ting Huang
Abstract: Altermagnets are defined as magnetic states with fully compensated spin angular momenta (spins) and broken PT (P: parity, T: time reversal, PT: parity times time reversal) symmetry. We classify three kinds of altermagnets: M-type: broken T symmetry and nonzero net magnetic moments, S-type: broken T symmetry and zero net magnetic moments, and A-type: unbroken T and broken P symmetries. Furthermore, strong altermagnets have spin split bands through exchange coupling in the non-relativistic limit, i.e., for zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and weak altermagnets has spin split bands only with non-zero SOC. These strong vs. weak altermagnets can be identified from the total number of symmetric orthogonal spin rotation operations. These classifications of altermagnets will be an essential guidance for the future research on altermagnetism.

Title: A compounded random walk for space-fractional diffusion on finite domains
Authors: Christopher N. Angstmann, Daniel S. Han, Bruce I. Henry, Boris Z. Huang, Zhuang Xu
Abstract: We formulate a compounded random walk that is physically well defined on both finite and infinite domains, and samples space-dependent forces throughout jumps. The governing evolution equation for the walk limits to a space-fractional Fokker-Planck equation valid on bounded domains, and recovers the well known superdiffusive space-fractional diffusion equation on infinite domains. We describe methods for numerical approximation and Monte Carlo simulations and demonstrate excellent correspondence with analytical solutions. This compounded random walk, and its associated fractional Fokker-Planck equation, provides a major advance for modeling space-fractional diffusion through potential fields and on finite domains.

Title: Physical aspects of symmetry breaking in an ideal Bose gas at thermal equilibrium
Authors: Alexej Schelle
Abstract: The theory of ideal gases is supplemented by a numerical quantum field description with a two-dimensional non-local order parameter that allows the modeling of wave-like atomic correlations and interference effects in the limit of low atomic densities. From the present model, it is possible to explain certain new fundamental symmetry aspects of ideal and very weakly interacting Bose gases, like the forward propagation of time and the relation to the breaking and preservation of phase gauge symmetry in solids. In the present formalism, the propagation of one-directional time arises from the pre-defined and equivalent convergence of independent quantum fields towards the Boltzmann equilibrium, and it is shown that Glauber coherent states are related to the definition of the quantized field. Coherently coupling condensate and non-condensate parts as a direct consequence of the increasing quantum coherence time between the different quantum field components in the Bose gas from cooling to below the critical temperature, the present model describes symmetry breaking, which is originally known from the definition of a specific gauge field from Elitzur's theorem for local gauge fields, as a global physical rather than a purely formal mathematical process.

Title: Dynamical activity universally bounds precision of response in Markovian nonequilibrium systems
Authors: Kangqiao Liu, Jie Gu
Abstract: The exploration of far-from-equilibrium systems has been at the forefront of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, with a particular focus on understanding the fluctuations and response of thermodynamic systems to external perturbations. In this study, we introduce a universal response kinetic uncertainty relation, which provides a fundamental trade-off between the precision of response for generic observables and dynamical activity in Markovian nonequilibrium systems. We demonstrate the practical applicability and tightness of the derived bound through illustrative examples. Our results are applicable to a broad spectrum of Markov jump processes, ranging from currents to non-current variables, from steady states to time-dependent driving, from continuous time to discrete time, and including Maxwell's demon or absolute irreversibility. Our findings not only enhance the theoretical foundation of stochastic thermodynamics but also may hold potential implications for far-from-equilibrium biochemical processes.

Title: Force-current structure in Markovian open quantum systems and its applications: geometric housekeeping-excess decomposition and thermodynamic trade-off relations
Authors: Kohei Yoshimura, Yoh Maekawa, Ryuna Nagayama, Sosuke Ito
Abstract: Thermodynamic force and irreversible current are the foundational concepts of classical nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Entropy production rate is provided by their product in classical systems, ranging from mesoscopic to macroscopic systems. However, there is no complete quantum extension of such a structure that respects quantum mechanics. In this paper, we propose anti-Hermitian operators that represent currents and forces accompanied by a gradient structure in open quantum systems described by the quantum master equation. We prove that the entropy production rate is given by the product of the force and current operators, which extends the canonical expression of the entropy production rate in the classical systems. The framework constitutes a comprehensive analogy with the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of discrete classical systems. We also show that the structure leads to the extensions of some results in stochastic thermodynamics: the geometric housekeeping-excess decomposition of entropy production and thermodynamic trade-off relations such as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and the dissipation-time uncertainty relation. In discussing the trade-off relations, we will introduce a measure of fluctuation, which we term the quantum diffusivity.

Title: Laser-Induced Relaxation Oscillations in Superconducting Nanobridge Single Photon Detectors
Authors: F.B. Baalbergen, I.E. Zadeh, M.J.A. de Dood
Abstract: We demonstrate novel laser-induced relaxation oscillations in superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). These oscillations appear when a voltage biased NbTiN nanobridge detector is illuminated with intense pulsed laser light at a repetition rate of ~19 MHz. They differ from the well-known relaxation oscillations by a step-wise increase in frequency and phase locking of the oscillations to the laser pulses. An electrical model that does not include thermal effects can be used to simulate the observed laser-induced relaxation oscillations. Good agreement to the experiment is achieved using realistic values for the parameters in the model.

Title: Quasiparticle Picture for Entanglement Hamiltonians in Higher Dimensions
Authors: Riccardo Travaglino, Colin Rylands, Pasquale Calabrese
Abstract: We employ the quasiparticle picture of entanglement evolution to obtain an effective description for the out-of-equilibrium Entanglement Hamiltonian at the hydrodynamical scale following quantum quenches in free fermionic systems in two or more spatial dimensions. Specifically, we begin by applying dimensional reduction techniques in cases where the geometry permits, building directly on established results from one-dimensional systems. Subsequently, we generalize the analysis to encompass a wider range of geometries. We obtain analytical expressions for the entanglement Hamiltonian valid at the ballistic scale, which reproduce the known quasiparticle picture predictions for the Renyi entropies and full counting statistics. We also numerically validate the results with excellent precision by considering quantum quenches from several initial configurations.

Title: Non-reciprocal mixtures in suspension: the role of hydrodynamic interactions
Authors: Giulia Pisegna, Navdeep Rana, Ramin Golestanian, Suropriya Saha
Abstract: The collective chasing dynamics of non-reciprocally coupled densities leads to stable travelling waves which can be mapped to a model for emergent flocking. In this work, we couple the non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model (NRCH) to a fluid to minimally describe scalar active mixtures in a suspension, with the aim to explore the stability of the waves, i.e. the emergent flock in the presence of self-generated fluid flows. We show that the emergent polarity is linearly unstable to perturbations for a specific sign of the active stress recalling instabilities of orientational order in a fluid. Using numerical simulations, we find however that non-reciprocity stabilizes the waves against the linear instability in a large region of the phase space.

Title: Enhanced Phonon-Phonon Interactions and Weakened Electron-Phonon Coupling in Charge-Density-Wave Topological Semimetal EuAl4 with a Possible Intermediate Electronic State
Authors: Shize Cao, Feng Jin, Jianzhou Zhao, Yun-Ze Long, Jianlin Luo, Qingming Zhang, Zhi-Guo Chen
Abstract: The origin of charge density wave (CDW) is a long-term open issue. Furthermore, the evolution of phonon-phonon interactions (PPI) across CDW transitions has rarely been investigated. Besides, whether electron-phonon coupling (EPC) would be weakened or enhanced after CDW transitions is still under debate. Additionally, CDW provides a fertile ground for uncovering intriguing intermediate electronic states. Here, we report a Raman spectroscopy study of the PPI and EPC in topological semimetal EuAl4 exhibiting a CDW phase below temperature Tc ~ 145 K. The free-charge-carrier-density (nc) and temperature dependences of the Fano asymmetric factors (1/|q|) of the two phonon modes A1g and B1g indicates that below Tc, the EPC becomes weakened probably due to the reduction of the nc. Interestingly, in the temperature range from 50 to 145 K, the steep growth of the 1/|q| leading to the significant deviation from the linear dependence on the nc, together with the shoulder-like features in the temperature evolutions of the 1/|q| and the nc around 50 K, implies the possible existence of an intermediate electronic state with the EPC distinctly larger than the CDW ground state in EuAl4. Furthermore, below Tc, the faster decrease in the full width at half maxima of the B1g phonon mode representing the collective vibrations of the CDW-modulated Al1 atoms suggests that a remarkable growth of the PPI for the B1g phonon mode after the CDW phase transition, which is in contrast to the weakening of the EPC and thus may mainly arise from the strengthening of lattice anharmonicity in EuAl4. Our results not only highlight the significance of the enhanced PPI and the weakened EPC in completely understanding the formation of the CDW phase but also initiate the exploration of novel intermediate electronic states in EuAl4.

Title: Annealing-Induced Magnetic Modulation in Co- and Y-doped CeO2: Insights from Experiments and DFT
Authors: Hemant Arora, Atul Bandyopadhyay, Arup Samanta
Abstract: The potential applications of dilute magnetic oxides (DMOs) in magneto-optic and spintronic devices have attracted significant attention, although understanding their magnetic behavior is complex due to intricate interactions of intrinsic defects. The present study aims to investigate the effect of different annealing environments on the magnetic properties of polycrystalline transition metal cation (Co and Y) doped CeO2 DMO with a 5% doping concentration of transition metal (TM). The objective is to investigate the defect interactions within the lattice through a comprehensive investigation involving structural characterizations, magnetic measurements, and first principle calculations. The results show that the Ar/H2 annealing environment induced more oxygen vacancies than air-annealed samples. Consequently, field-dependent magnetization measurements revealed above-room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) in both un-doped and TM-doped CeO2. The ferromagnetic (FM) properties of CeO2 resulted from carrier-trapped vacancy centers facilitating exchange interactions between the spins of magnetic ions. The Langevin field profile indicated that TM-doped CeO2 formed more bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) during annealing in an Ar/H2 environment, which contributed to the enhanced ferromagnetism. Similarly, enhancement in the magnetic properties with increasing oxygen vacancies is observed through first principle calculations. This suggests the potential for optimizing the magnetic properties of DMOs through controlled annealing processes.

Title: Partition Function Zeros of Paths and Normalization Zeros of ASEPS
Authors: Zdzislaw Burda, Desmond A. Johnston
Abstract: We exploit the equivalence between the partition function of an adsorbing Dyck walk model and the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ASEP) normalization to obtain the thermodynamic limit of the locus of the ASEP normalization zeros from a conformal map. We discuss the equivalence between this approach and using an electrostatic analogy to determine the locus, both in the case of the ASEP and the random allocation model.

Title: Critical Current, Lengthwise Fluctuations, and Flux Jumps in REBCO CC: A Torque Magnetometry Study up to 45 T
Authors: J. Jaroszynski, A-M Constantinescu, D. Kolb-Bond, A. Francis, A. Xu, R. Ries, G. Bradford, J. Bang, J. Lee, D. Larbalestier (National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Tallahassee FL)
Abstract: Rare Earth Barium Copper Oxide (REBCO) coated conductors (CCs) have emerged for future high field magnets in fields and temperatures inaccessible for Nb based superconductors. However, their exceptionally high current densities pose challenges for low temperature characterization. This paper presents the design and implementation of a simple torque magnetometer that is particularly suitable for characterizing REBCO CC. It details the construction and underlying physics, with a particular emphasis on its capability to assess the angular critical currents Ic in high magnetic fields and low temperatures. The study includes characterizations of multiple REBCO samples from different manufacturers, performed under magnetic fields up to 45 T, demonstrating the exceptional capabilities of REBCO CCs in extreme fields. The results revealed significant lengthwise Ic variations, especially in tapes cut from the edges of 12 mm-wide production tapes compared to those cut from the center. These variations are most pronounced when the field is near the ab plane. Importantly, flux jumps are observed in samples with thick REBCO layers and thin stabilizers, underscoring the potential thermal instabilities. These findings provide valuable insights into the performance of REBCO tapes under extreme magnetic fields, highlighting their relevance for high-field magnet and nuclear fusion applications.

Title: Simulation study on Conservative Join (C-join) in Skyrmion Brownian circuit
Authors: H. Imanishi, E. Tamura, S. Miki, R. Ishikawa, H. Nomura, M. Goto, Y. Suzuki
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, which exhibit Brownian motion in solid-state systems, are promising candidates as signal carriers for Brownian computing. However, successfully implementing such systems requires two critical components: a Hub to connect multiple wires and a C-join to synchronize the skyrmion signal carriers. While the former has been successfully addressed, the latter remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a novel solution by decomposing the C-join into two sub-circuits, the Join and Fork, and validate their functionality using a particle simulation approach. Our results demonstrate that the C-join can effectively synchronize skyrmion signals within 6.8{\mu}s with a 99.9% success rate at low temperatures. Additionally, we construct the Half-adder in a crossing-free architecture utilizing the C-join circuits. These findings pave the way for the realization of skyrmion-based Brownian computing systems.

Title: Distinguishing thermal fluctuations from polaron formation in halide perovskites
Authors: Bai-Qing Zhao, Xuan-Yan Chen, Chuan-Nan Li, Jinshan Li, Chris G. Van de Walle, Xie Zhang
Abstract: Recent angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of the hole effective mass in CsPbBr$_3$ revealed an enhancement of $\sim$50 % compared to the bare mass computed from first principles for CsPbBr$_3$ at $T = 0 K$. This large enhancement was interpreted as evidence of polaron formation. Employing accurate finite-temperature first-principles calculations, we show that the calculated hole effective mass of CsPbBr$_3$ at $T = 300 K$ can explain experimental results without invoking polarons. Thermal fluctuations are particularly strong in halide perovskites compared to conventional semiconductors such as Si and GaAs, and cannot be ignored when comparing with experiment. We not only resolve the debate on polaron formation in halide perovskites, but also demonstrate the general importance of including thermal fluctuations in first-principles calculations for strongly anharmonic materials.

Title: Magnetic Bloch States at Integer Flux Quanta Induced by Super-moiré Potential in Graphene Aligned with Twisted Boron Nitride
Authors: Yaqi Ma, Meizhen Huang, Xu Zhang, Weixiong Hu, Zishu Zhou, Kai Feng, Wenhui Li, Yong Chen, Chenxuan Lou, Weikang Zhang, Haoxi Ji, Yibo Wang, Zefei Wu, Xiaodong Cui, Wang Yao, Shichao Yan, Zi Yang Meng, Ning Wang
Abstract: Two-dimensional electron systems in both magnetic fields and periodic potentials are described by Hofstadter butterfly, a fundamental problem of solid-state physics. While moiré systems provide a powerful method to realize this spectrum, previous experiments, however, have been limited to fractional flux quanta regime due to the difficulty of building ~ 50 nm periodic modulations. Here, we demonstrate a super-moiré strategy to overcome this challenge. By aligning monolayer graphene (G) with 1.0° twisted hexagonal boron nitride (t-hBN), a 63.2 nm bichromatic G/t-hBN super-moiré is constructed, made possible by exploiting the electrostatic nature of t-hBN potential. Under magnetic field B, magnetic Bloch states at integer flux quanta (1-9) are achieved and observed as integer Brown-Zak oscillations, expanding the flux quanta from factions to integers. Theoretical analysis reproduces these experimental findings. This work opens new avenues to study unexplored Hofstadter butterfly, explore emergent topological order at integer flux quanta and engineer long-wavelength periodic modulations.

Title: Two Channel Multi impurity Kondo model
Authors: A. M. Tsvelik, G. Kotliar
Abstract: We show that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasua-Yoisida interaction in two channel Kondo impurity systems is a relevant perturbation when the number of impurities N is greater than 3. We find a new critical point with anomalous dimensions 1/(N+1) for the spin operator and the Sommerfeld coefficient of the specific heat scales as $\gamma \sim T^{- \frac{3}{N+1}}$. The inter-channel hybridization plays the role of the most relevant operator at this fixed point having anomalous dimensions (N-1)/(2N+2)$. The critical point universal properties are relevant to many strong correlation problems, such as impurity placed in a Majorana metal and the multichannel Kondo lattice model of heavy fermion materials. We discuss relevance of our results for cluster DMFT studies of quantum criticality.

Title: Hamiltonian Truncation Crafted for UV-divergent QFTs
Authors: Olivier Delouche, Joan Elias Miro, James Ingoldby
Abstract: We develop the theory of Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) to systematically study RG flows that require the renormalization of coupling constants. This is a necessary step towards making HT a fully general method for QFT calculations. We apply this theory to a number of QFTs defined as relevant deformations of $d=1+1$ CFTs. We investigated three examples of increasing complexity: the deformed Ising, Tricritical-Ising, and non-unitary minimal model $M(3,7)$. The first two examples provide a crosscheck of our methodologies against well established characteristics of these theories. The $M(3,7)$ CFT deformed by its $Z_2$-even operators shows an intricate phase diagram that we clarify. At a boundary of this phase diagram we show that this theory flows, in the IR, to the $M(3,5)$ CFT.

Title: Generalized Zeno effect and entanglement dynamics induced by fermion counting
Authors: Elias Starchl, Mark H. Fischer, Lukas M. Sieberer
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional lattice system of free fermions subjected to a generalized measurement process: the system exchanges particles with its environment, but each fermion leaving or entering the system is counted. In contrast to the freezing of dynamics due to frequent measurements of lattice site occupation numbers, a high rate of fermion counts induces fast fluctuations in the state of the system. Still, through numerical simulations of quantum trajectories and an analytical approach based on replica Keldysh field theory, we find that instantaneous correlations and entanglement properties of free fermions subjected to fermion counting and local occupation measurements are strikingly similar. We explain this similarity through a generalized Zeno effect induced by fermion counting and a universal long-wavelength description in terms of a nonlinear sigma model. The physical requirements underlying this universal emergent behavior are conservation of the total number of particles in the system and its environment, and conservation of the purity of the state of the system by keeping a full record of all measurement outcomes. For both types of measurement processes, we present strong evidence against the existence of a critical phase with logarithmic entanglement and conformal invariance. Instead, we identify a finite critical range of length scales on which signatures of conformal invariance are observable. While area-law entanglement is established beyond a scale that is exponentially large in the measurement rate, the upper boundary of the critical range is only algebraically large and thus numerically accessible. Our finding that these properties do not rely on particle number conservation has far reaching implications for measurement-induced phenomena beyond noninteracting fermions, such as charge sharpening in random quantum circuits or generic interacting systems.

Title: Perturbative stability and error correction thresholds of quantum codes
Authors: Yaodong Li, Nicholas O'Dea, Vedika Khemani
Abstract: Topologically-ordered phases are stable to local perturbations, and topological quantum error-correcting codes enjoy thresholds to local errors. We connect the two notions of stability by constructing classical statistical mechanics models for decoding general CSS codes and classical linear codes. Our construction encodes correction success probabilities under uncorrelated bit-flip and phase-flip errors, and simultaneously describes a generalized Z2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We observe that the clean limit of the latter is precisely the discretized imaginary time path integral of the corresponding quantum code Hamiltonian when the errors are turned into a perturbative X or Z magnetic field. Motivated by error correction considerations, we define general order parameters for all such generalized Z2 lattice gauge theories, and show that they are generally lower bounded by success probabilities of error correction. For CSS codes satisfying the LDPC condition and with a sufficiently large code distance, we prove the existence of a low temperature ordered phase of the corresponding lattice gauge theories, particularly for those lacking Euclidean spatial locality and/or when there is a nonzero code rate. We further argue that these results provide evidence to stable phases in the corresponding perturbed quantum Hamiltonians, obtained in the limit of continuous imaginary time. To do so, we distinguish space- and time-like defects in the lattice gauge theory. A high free-energy cost of space-like defects corresponds to a successful "memory experiment" and suppresses the energy splitting among the ground states, while a high free-energy cost of time-like defects corresponds to a successful "stability experiment" and points to a nonzero gap to local excitations.

Title: Protecting Quantum Information via Many-Body Dynamical Localization
Authors: Ling-Zhi Tang, Dan-Wei Zhang, Hai-Feng Yu, Z. D. Wang
Abstract: Dynamically localized states in quantum many-body systems are fundamentally important in understanding quantum thermalization and have applications in quantum information processing. Here we explore many-body dynamical localization (MBDL) without disorders in a non-integrable quantum XY spin chain under periodical and quadratic kicks. We obtain the localization phase regimes with the MBDL and delocalized states and show dynamical observables to extract the phase regimes. For proper kick strengths in the MBDL phase, we reveal a local dynamical decoupling effect for persistent Rabi oscillation of certain spins. Furthermore, we propose the MBDL-protected quantum information at high temperatures, and present an analysis of the dynamical decoupling to obtain the required system parameters for quantum storage. Compared to other non-thermalized states, the disorder-free MBDL states require much fewer repetitions and resources, providing a promising way to protect and store quantum information robust against thermal noises.

Title: The scaling limit of boundary spin correlations in non-integrable Ising models
Authors: Giulia Cava, Alessandro Giuliani, Rafael Leon Greenblatt
Abstract: We consider a class of non-integrable 2D Ising models obtained by perturbing the nearest-neighbor model via a weak, finite range potential which preserves translation and spin-flip symmetry, and we study its critical theory in the half-plane. We prove that the leading order long-distance behavior of the correlation functions for spins on the boundary is the same as for the nearest-neighbor model, up to an analytic multiplicative renormalization constant. In particular, the scaling limit is the Pfaffian of an explicit matrix. The proof is based on an exact representation of the generating function of correlations in terms of a Grassmann integral and on a multiscale analysis thereof, generalizing previous results to include observables located on the boundary.

Title: Genuine multipartite entanglement from many-electron systems
Authors: Filippo Troiani, Celestino Angeli, Andrea Secchi, Stefano Pittalis
Abstract: We demonstrate that, contrary to common wisdom, genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) can be abundantly generated from simple non-correlated many-electron states. We show that the extracted GME can be maximized via spin-independent transformations derived from the quantum Fourier transform. We further demonstrate the possibility of maximizing the GME through localized orbitals in a variety of realistic systems and correlated states. Towards the exploitation of potentially useful entanglement, we rationalize system-specific and universal features of the extracted GME.

Title: Ginzburg-Landau description of a class of non-unitary minimal models
Authors: Andrei Katsevich, Igor R. Klebanov, Zimo Sun
Abstract: It has been proposed that the Ginzburg-Landau description of the non-unitary conformal minimal model $M(3,8)$ is provided by the Euclidean theory of two real scalar fields with third-order interactions that have imaginary coefficients. The same lagrangian describes the non-unitary model $M(3,10)$, which is a product of two Yang-Lee theories $M(2,5)$, and the Renormalization Group flow from it to $M(3,8)$. This proposal has recently passed an important consistency check, due to Y. Nakayama and T. Tanaka, based on the anomaly matching for non-invertible topological lines. In this paper, we elaborate the earlier proposal and argue that the two-field theory describes the $D$ series modular invariants of both $M(3,8)$ and $M(3,10)$. We further propose the Ginzburg-Landau descriptions of the entire class of $D$ series minimal models $M(q, 3q-1)$ and $M(q, 3q+1)$, with odd integer $q$. They involve $PT$ symmetric theories of two scalar fields with interactions of order $q$ multiplied by imaginary coupling constants.

Title: First-principle theory of the Casimir screening effect
Authors: Yu.A. Budkov, P.E. Brandyshev
Abstract: In this paper, we use the formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory to investigate the Casimir force between flat, ideally conductive surfaces containing confined, but mobile ions. We demonstrate that, in the Gaussian approximation, the ionic fluctuations contribute separately from the electromagnetic fluctuations that are responsible for the standard Casimir effect. This is in line with the "separation hypothesis", has been previously applied on a purely intuitive basis. Our analysis demonstrates the significance of calculating the zero Matsubara frequency component in the electromagnetic contribution, using the formula developed by Schwinger et al., as opposed to the approach based on Lifshitz theory used by other researchers.

Title: Partial-immunity of two-photon correlation against wavefront distortion for spatially entangled photons
Authors: Kiran Bajar, Rounak Chatterjee, Vikas S. Bhat, Sushil Mujumdar
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum entanglement in photons offers notable technological advancements over traditional qubit-based systems, including increased information density and enhanced security. However, such high-dimensional states are vulnerable to disruption by complex disordered media, presenting significant challenges in practical applications. Spatially-entangled photons are conventionally generated using a nonlinear crystal via spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). While the effect of disorder on spatially entangled photons in the near field of the crystal is well understood, the impact of disorder in the far field is more complex. In this work, we present a systematic study of the randomization of two-photon correlations caused by arbitrary phase distortions in the far field by breaking it down into odd and even parity components. First, we theoretically show that the two-photon field is only sensitive to the even-parity part of the phase distortion. In follow-up experiments, we employ a deformable mirror to implement random phase distortions, separating the contributions of odd and even parity phases using Zernike polynomials. The experimental results are in agreements with the theoretical predictions. Subsequently, we perform numerical simulations to show that these results extend to stronger degrees of disorder. Our key finding is that, since two-photon correlations are only affected by the even-parity component of phase modulations, the number of independent adaptive optics elements required for optimizing the correlation can be effectively halved, offering a significant practical advantage in managing disorder in quantum systems.

Title: Sphere free energy of scalar field theories with cubic interactions
Authors: Simone Giombi, Elizabeth Himwich, Andrei Katsevich, Igor Klebanov, Zimo Sun
Abstract: The dimensional continuation approach to calculating the free energy of $d$-dimensional Euclidean CFT on the round sphere $S^d$ has been used to develop its $4-\epsilon$ expansion for a number of well-known non-supersymmetric theories, such as the $O(N)$ model. The resulting estimate of the sphere free energy $F$ in the 3D Ising model has turned out to be in good agreement with the numerical value obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization. In this paper, we develop the $6-\epsilon$ expansions for CFTs on $S^d$ described by scalar field theory with cubic interactions and use their resummations to estimate the values of $F$. In particular, we study the theories with purely imaginary coupling constants, which describe non-unitary universality classes arising when certain conformal minimal models are continued above two dimensions. The Yang-Lee model $M(2,5)$ is described by a field theory with one scalar field, while the $D$-series $M(3,8)$ model is described by two scalar fields. We also study the $OSp(1|2)$ symmetric cubic theory of one commuting and two anti-commuting scalar fields, which appears to describe the critical behavior of random spanning forests. In the course of our work, we revisit the calculations of beta functions of marginal operators containing the curvature. We also use another method for approximating $F$, which relies on perturbation theory around the bilocal action near the long-range/short-range crossover. The numerical values it gives for $F$ tend to be in good agreement with other available methods.

Title: Gradient Flows and the Curvature of Theory Space
Authors: William H. Pannell, Andreas Stergiou
Abstract: The metric and potential associated with the gradient property of renormalisation group flow in multiscalar models in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions are studied. The metric is identified with the Zamolodchikov metric of nearly marginal operators on the sphere. An explicit form for the associated Ricci scalar in $d=4-\varepsilon$ is derived, which shows that the space of multiscalar field theories is curved. The potential is identified with a quantity $\widetilde{F}$ that was previously proposed as a weakly monotonic function interpolating between the $a$-theorem in four dimensions and the $F$-theorem in three dimensions. This implies that the $\widetilde{F}$-theorem can be extended perturbatively to a theorem about gradient flow in $d=4-\varepsilon$.
