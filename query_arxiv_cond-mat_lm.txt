Title: Engineering deterministic, tunable, and reversible folds in graphene with the use of ultrafast laser micro-patterned stretchable polymer substrate
Authors: A.F. Juarez Saborio, F. Bourquard, R. Galafassi, A. Claudel, L. Marty, A. Piednoir, M. Mercury, R. Fulcrand, C. Albin, V. Barnier, F. Garrelie, A. San-Miguel, F. Vialla
Abstract: The unique atomic monolayer structure of graphene gives rise to a broad range of remarkable mechanical folding properties. However, significant challenges remain in effectively harnessing them in a controllable and scalable manner. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach that employs micron-scale cavities, fabricated through ultrafast laser patterning, in a stretchable polymer substrate to locally modulate adhesion and strain transfer to a graphene monolayer. This technique enables the deterministic induction of single folds in graphene with fold dimensions, width and height in the hundreds of nanometers, tunable through the geometry of the polymer cavities and the applied strain. Importantly, these folds are reversible, returning to a flat morphology with minimal structural damage, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, our method allows for the creation of fields of folds with reproducible periodicity, defining clear potential for practical applications. These findings pave the way for the development of advanced devices that would leverage the strain and morphology-sensitive properties of graphene.

Title: Bootstrapping Flat-band Superconductors: Rigorous Lower Bounds on Superfluid Stiffness
Authors: Qiang Gao, Zhaoyu Han, Eslam Khalaf
Abstract: The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration free models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple intra-unit-cell magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. Straight-forward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.

Title: High spin, low spin or gapped spins: magnetism in the bilayer nickelates
Authors: Hanbit Oh, Yi-Ming Wu, Julian May-Mann, Yijun Yu, Harold Y. Hwang, Ya-Hui Zhang, S. Raghu
Abstract: Inspired by the recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, we investigate the role of magnetism emerging from a hypothetical insulating $d^8$ parent state. We demonstrate that due to the interplay of superexchange and Hund's coupling, the system can be in a high-spin, low-spin or spin-gapped state. The low-spin state has singlets across the bilayer in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, with charge carriers in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Thus, at low energy scales, it behaves as an effective one band system when hole doped. By contrast, the high-spin state is a more robust, spin-1 antiferromagnet. Using Hartree-Fock methods, we find that for fixed interaction strength and doping, high-spin magnetism remains more robust than the low-spin counterpart. Whether this implies that the high spin state provides a stronger pairing glue, or more strongly competes with superconductivity remains an open question. Our analysis therefore underscores the importance of identifying the spin state for understanding superconductivity in nickelates.

Title: Pseudo-chiral phonon splitting from octupolar magnetic order
Authors: Ruairidh Sutcliffe, Kathleen Hart, Swati Chaudhary, Arun Paramekanti
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of anomalously large magnetic response of chiral phonons in dipolar magnets, we explore an extension to study Einstein quantum phonon modes coupled to multipolar moments. We consider the case of non-Kramers $\Gamma_3$ doublets which encapsulate quadrupolar and Ising octupolar degrees of freedom, and which feature a symmetry-allowed linear coupling between local quadrupolar moments and Raman active $E_g$ phonon modes $(d_{x^2-y^2},d_{3z^2-r^2})$. We show that either octupolar or quadrupolar ordering leads to degeneracy breaking of the $E_g$ phonon doublet, with ferro-octupolar order favoring pseudo-chiral phonon eigenmodes with a detectable energy splitting. We describe this physics using a path integral approach in the limit where `fast' phonon modes sense the `slow' pseudospins as a static background which we average over using Monte Carlo simulations. We discuss implications for materials such as Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$ and PrV$_2$Al$_{20}$ where Raman spectroscopy of phonons could be used as a potential probe of hidden octupolar order. Our work extends the important concept of chiral phonons to a large class of multipolar magnets.

Title: Strong Correlations, Green's Function Zeros and Topological Transitions in Orbital-Symmetry-Controlled Chemical Reactions
Authors: Ziren Xie, Amir Mirzanejad, Lukas Muechler
Abstract: We integrate concepts from topological band theory and strong-correlation physics with the principle of orbital symmetry conservation, which characterizes reactions as symmetry allowed or forbidden based on whether molecular orbitals cross along the reaction coordinate. Using a $4\pi$ electrocyclization as an example, we show how Green's functions generalize the concepts of symmetry allowed and symmetry forbidden reactions even in the presence of strong multi-reference correlations. We demonstrate how symmetry forbidden reactions are characterized by strong multi-reference correlations, resulting in crossings of Green's function zeros rather than poles as MO-theory would predict. Taking into account Green's functions zeros, a topological invariant is introduced that captures symmetry protected crossings of poles or zeros. We discuss the effects of symmetry breaking and outline generalizations of our approach to reactions without any conserved spatial symmetries along the reaction path. Our work lays the groundwork for systematic application of modern topological methods to chemical reactions and can be generalized to reactions involving different spin states or to excited states.

Title: Superconductivity on the edge of vanishing magnetic order
Authors: Zhiqiang Wang, Ke Wang, K. Levin
Abstract: There should be no question that magnetism and superconductivity appear in close proximity in many if not most of the unconventional superconductors. These two phases are importantly correlated: the strongest manifestations of this superconducting pairing are generally associated with the weakest magnetism. It is often stated that this behavior results from a quantum critical point (QCP), although not all such superconductors fit into this category. In this paper we consider a second scenario for addressing these proximity phenomena in which no QCP is present. Although there are other examples for this latter category, most notable are those associated with very strongly paired superconductors that have insulating and magnetically ordered ``parent" materials. Here, too, one finds that ``failed" long range order is key to establishing superconductivity. This leads to the general question, which is the focus of this paper. Why, and how, in either of these contexts, does this proximal magnetism play a constructive role in helping to stabilize superconductivity? Our understanding here should help pave the way towards the discovery of new families of superconductors, which are expected to emerge on the brink of magnetism.

Title: Nonequilibrium Theory for Adaptive Systems in Varying Environments
Authors: Ying-Jen Yang, Charles D. Kocher, Ken A. Dill
Abstract: Biological organisms thrive by adapting to their environments, which are often unpredictably changeable. We apply recent results from nonequilibrium physics to show that organisms' fitness parses into a static generalist component and a nonequilibrium tracking component. Our findings: (1) Environmental changes that are too fast or too small are not worth tracking. (2) Well-timed anticipatory tracking enhances fitness in coherent environments. (3) We compute and explain the optimal adaptive strategy for a system in a given environment, such as bet hedging or phenotypic memory. Conversely, (4) We compute and explain the optimal way for an environment to control a given system, for example for designing drug regimens to limit the growth of pathogens. By connecting fitness, adaptive strategy, and environmental variability, this work provides the foundations for a generic physical theory of adaptivity.

Title: Dynamics of Phase-Separated Interfaces in Inhomogenous and Driven Mixtures
Authors: Jacopo Romano, Ramin Golestanian, Benoît Mahault
Abstract: We derive effective equations of motion governing the dynamics of sharp interfaces in phase-separated binary mixtures driven by spatio-temporal modulations of their material properties. We demonstrate, in particular, that spatial heterogeneities in the surface tension induce an effective capillary force that drives the motion of interfaces, even in the absence of hydrodynamics. Applying our sharp interface model to quantify the dynamics of thermophoretic droplets, we find that their deformation and transport properties are controlled by a combination of bulk and capillary forces, whose relative strength depends on droplet size. Strikingly, we show that small thermophobic droplets -- composed of a material with a positive Soret coefficient -- can spontaneously migrate towards high-temperature regions as a result of capillary forces.

Title: Discovery of magnon self-interaction in a strongly driven antiferromagnet
Authors: David Rohrbach, Zhuquan Zhang, Takayuki Kurihara, Keith A. Nelson
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamics govern a wide array of natural phenomena and are essential for understanding nonequilibrium behaviors in condensed matter systems. In magnetically ordered materials, magnons - the quanta of spin waves - exhibit intrinsic nonlinearities that are of great interest in fundamental research and practical applications. Despite progress in the nonlinear control of magnon modes in antiferromagnetic materials, the transition from perturbative to non-perturbative regimes of magnon coherences has remained elusive. Here, we explore the nonlinear dynamics of a magnon mode in an antiferromagnet using two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy with waveguide-enhanced terahertz fields. By driving the magnon mode far from equilibrium, we demonstrate the emergence of high-order magnon coherences and delineate a distinct transition into non-perturbative magnon nonlinearities. This behavior originates from the intrinsic anharmonicity of the magnetic potential and marks a regime dominated by magnon self-interactions at large spin deflection angles. These findings provide fundamental mechanistic insights that might be exploited for ultrafast switching and other advanced magnonic applications.

Title: Supercurrent-induced antiferromagnetic order and spin-triplet pair generation in quantum critical d-wave superconductors
Authors: Kyohei Nakamura, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: A supercurrent is well recognized as being of prime importance within mean-field theory, but remains largely unexplored in strongly correlated electron systems (SCES) and the quantum critical region. To clarify the impact of the supercurrent on magnetism and superconductivity near an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point, we study the two-dimensional Hubbard model based on a fluctuation exchange approximation for a current-carrying superconducting state. We show a supercurrent-induced antiferromagnetism and emergence of spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The former results from Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, suppression in the superconducting gap, and strong correlation effects beyond the mean-field theory. Our results suggest that the supercurrent can bring out rich phenomena of superconductivity in SCES.

Title: Emergent collective dynamics from motile photokinetic organisms
Authors: J. Morales, P. Munoz, D. Noto, H.N Ulloa, F. Guzman-Lastra
Abstract: The day-night cycle drives the largest biomass migration on Earth: the diel vertical migration (DVM) of aquatic organisms. Here, we present a three-dimensional agent-based model that incorporates photokinesis, gyrotaxis, and stochastic reorientation to explore how individual-level swimming behaviors give rise to population-scale DVM patterns. By solving Langevin equations for swarms of swimmers, we identify four distinct regimes -- Surface Accumulation, Shallow DVM, Deep DVM, and Sinking -- governed by two key dimensionless parameters: the Peclet number (Pe), representing motility persistence, and the vertical swimming asymmetry ratio (W=wdown/wup), encoding photokinetic bias. These regimes emerge from nonlinear interactions between light-driven navigation and active noise, diagnosed through topological and statistical features of vertical distributions. A critical feedback is uncovered: upward-biased swimming (W<1) promotes surface aggregation, while excessive downward bias (W>1) leads to irreversible sinking. Analytical estimates link regime boundaries to gyrotactic alignment and velocity reversals. Together, our results provide a mechanistic framework to interpret DVM diversity and emphasize the central role of light gradients-beyond absolute intensity-in shaping ecological self-organization.

Title: Future prospect of anisotropic 2D tin sulfide (SnS) for emerging electronic and quantum device applications
Authors: Abdus Salam Sarkar
Abstract: The family of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) emerging materials is rapidly evolving due to their low crystal symmetry and in-plane structural anisotropy. Among these, 2D tin sulfide (SnS) has gained significant attention because of its distinctive crystalline symmetry and the resulting extraordinary anisotropic physical properties. This perspective explores recent developments in anisotropic 2D SnS. In particular, it highlights advances in isolating high-quality SnS monolayers (1L-SnS) and in applying advanced techniques for anisotropic characterization. The discussion continues with an overview of the anisotropic optical properties of SnS, followed by recent progress in emerging electronic device applications, including energy storage, neuromorphic (synaptic) systems, and quantum technologies. In addition to presenting significant research findings on SnS, this perspective outlines current limitations and discusses emerging opportunities and future prospects for its application in quantum devices.

Title: Localization and splitting of a quantum droplet by immersing a heavy impurity
Authors: F. Bristy, G. A. Bougas, G. C. Katsimiga, S. I. Mistakidis
Abstract: We unravel the existence and nonequilibrium response of one-dimensional harmonically trapped droplet configurations in the presence of a central repulsive or attractive potential well mimicking the effect of a heavy impurity. For fixed negative chemical potentials, it is shown that droplets fragment into two for increasing repulsive potential heights, a process that occurs faster for larger widths. However, atoms from the droplet accumulate at the attractive potential, especially for wider ones, leading to a deformed droplet and eventually to the termination of the solution. Linearization analysis yields the underlying excitation spectrum which dictates stability and the behavior of the ensuing collective modes. Quenches in the potential height are used to demonstrate dynamical fragmentation of the droplet for repulsive potentials as well as self-evaporation along with droplet localization and eventual relaxation for longer evolution times in the case of attractive potential wells. The many-body character of the dynamics is explicated by evaluating the participating single-particle eigenstates manifesting the superposition nature of the droplet state. Our results should be detectable by current ultracold atom experiments and may inspire engineered droplet dynamics with the aid of external potentials.

Title: A Novel Analysis Framework for Microstructural Characterization of Ferroelectric Hafnia: Experimental Validation and Application
Authors: Yoonsang Park, Jaeduck Jang, Hyangsook Lee, Kihong Kim, Kyooho Jung, Yunseong Lee, Jaewoo Lee, Eunji Yang, Sanghyun Jo, Sijung Yoo, Hyun Jae Lee, Donghoon Kim, Duk-Hyun Choe, Seunggeol Nam
Abstract: Herein, we present a novel analysis framework for grain size profile of ferroelectric hafnia to tackle critical shortcomings inherent in the current microstructural analysis. We vastly enhanced visibility of grains with ion beam treatment and performed accurate grain segmentation using deep neural network (DNN). By leveraging our new method, we discovered unexpected discrepancies that contradict previous results, such as deposition temperature (Tdep) and post-metallization annealing (PMA) dependence of grain size statistics, prompting us to reassess earlier interpretations. Combining microstructural analysis with electrical tests, we found that grain size reduction had both positive and negative outcomes: it caused significant diminishing of die-to-die variation (~68 % decrease in standard deviation) in coercive field (Ec), while triggering an upsurge in leakage current. These uncovered results signify robustness of our method in characterization of ferroelectric hafnia for in-depth examination of both device variability and reliability.

Title: Controlling Topological Quantum Transport via Non-Perturbative Light-Matter Interaction in Disordered Systems
Authors: Jorge Martinez Romeral, Luis M.Canonico, Aron W.Cummings, Stephan Roche
Abstract: We report the possibility to induce topological quantum transport in otherwise trivial systems through non-perturbative light-matter interactions, as well as the enhancement of this effect in the presence of disorder. Going beyond prior theoretical approaches, we introduce a computational framework which performs large-scale real-space quantum dynamics simulations, including carrier thermalization and disorder effects, in systems driven out of equilibrium by light or other external interactions. This methodology is illustrated in gapped single-layer and Bernal bilayer graphene but can be implemented in arbitrarily complex systems, including disordered and aperiodic systems, opening novel avenues for the design of multifunctional topological electronic devices that work in far-from-equilibrium regimes.

Title: Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems: III. Thermodynamic Signals
Authors: Takafumi Kita
Abstract: We study thermodynamic consequences of the hidden Bose-Einstein singularities, which have been predicted to cause a pseudogap phase, based on quantum field theory of ordered phases. Starting from the Luttinger-Ward functional for the grand thermodynamic potential, we derive expressions of the Helmholtz free energy, internal energy, entropy, and heat capacity in a form suitable for numerical studies. They are applied to the weakly attractive Hubbard model in three dimensions to calculate the thermodynamic potentials numerically and continuously for the normal, pseudogap, and superconducting phases on the same footing. It is shown that the entry into the pseudogap phase is detectable as singularities of thermodynamic potentials, especially a discontinuity in the heat capacity.

Title: High Pressure Growth of Transition-Metal Monosilicide RhGe Single Crystals
Authors: Xiangjiang Dong, Bowen Zhang, Xubin Ye, Peng Wei, Lie Lian, Ning Sun, Youwen Long, Shangjie Tian, Shouguo Wang, Hechang Lei, Runze Yu
Abstract: Transition-metal monosilicide RhGe has been reported to exhibit weak itinerant ferromagnetism, superconductivity, and topological properties. In this study, we report the high-pressure growth of high-quality RhGe single crystals up to millimeter size using flux method. Transport measurements reveal the metallic behavior of RhGe between 2-300 K with Fermi liquid behavior at low temperature region. However, no superconductivity was observed with variations in Ge composition. Magnetic characterizations indicate that RhGe exhibits a paramagnetic behavior between 2-300 K. The high-quality, large-size RhGe single crystals pave the way for further investigation of their topological properties using spectroscopic techniques.

Title: Simulation of Flagellated Bacteria Near a Solid Surface: Effects of Flagellar Morphology and Ionic Strength
Authors: Baopi Liu, Bowen Jin, Ning An
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the dynamics of the bacterial transition from free-swimming to surface adhesion, a process characterized by both height $h$ and inclination angle $\Psi$. The surface entrapment process is divided into three main stages. Initially, bacteria swim towards the surface at an approach velocity proportional to the motor rotation frequency. Subsequently, during the reorientation stage, the cotangent of the inclination angle decays exponentially with the product of the motor rotation frequency and time. Finally, the combined effect of near-field hydrodynamic interactions and DLVO forces drives the bacteria to a stable fixed point $(h^{*},\Psi^{*})$ near the surface. Bacteria with left-handed chiral flagella exhibit clockwise circular motion on the surface. The stable height, inclination angle, and radius of curvature of these circular trajectories are collectively determined by the flagellar morphology and ionic strength of the electrolyte solution. More precisely, increasing the contour length of the flagellum decreases the stable inclination angle and increases the radius of curvature. In contrast, decreasing the ionic strength increases the stable height and radius of curvature, while also decreasing the stable inclination angle. Typically, the stable inclination angle falls within $(\pi/2,\pi)$, the stable height ranges from a few nanometers to approximately one hundred nanometers, and the radius of curvature of the circular motion spans several to tens of micrometers.

Title: Effect of Berry connection on attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in gapped graphene
Authors: Jiayu Yan, Hongxuan Er, Wei Dang, Jiahuan Ren, Chao Chen, Dianxiang Ren, Fulong Dong
Abstract: We investigated the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) in gapped graphene by numerically solving the four-band density-matrix equations. Our results reveal that, in contrast to graphene whose fishbone-shaped spectra primarily oscillates at twice the frequency of the pump laser, the ATAS of gapped graphene exhibits a first-order harmonic component induced by the Berry connection. To gain insight into this interesting results, we employ a simplified model that considers only the nonequivalent electrons at $\Gamma$ and $\textrm{M}$ points in the Brillouin zone. This model allows us to derive an analytical expression for the ATAS contribution stemming from the Berry connection. Our analytical results qualitatively reproduce the key features observed in the numerical simulations, and reveal that the first-order harmonic component of spectra arises ont only from the Berry connections but also from the energy shifts associated with the effective mass of electrons at the $\Gamma$ and $\textrm{M}$ points. These results shed light on the complex generation mechanism of the ATAS in symmetry-broken materials.

Title: Very strong coupling limit of Eliashberg-McMillan theory and the upper limit for superconducting transition temperature
Authors: M.V. Sadovskii
Abstract: We present a brief review of some recent work on the problem of highest achievable temperature of superconducting transition $T_c$ in electron-phonon systems. The discovery of record-breaking values of $T_c$ in quite a number of hydrides under high pressure was an impressive demonstration of capabilities of electron-phonon mechanism of Cooper pairing. This lead to an increased interest on possible limitations of Eliashberg-McMillan theory as the main theory of superconductivity in a system of electrons and phonons. We shall consider some basic conclusions following from this theory and present some remarks on the limit of very strong electron-phonon coupling. We shall discuss possible limitations on the value of the coupling constant related to possible lattice and specific heat instability and conclude that within the stable metallic phase the effective pairing constant may acquire very large values. Finally we discuss some bounds for $T_c$ derived in the strong coupling limit and propose an elementary estimate of an upper limit for $T_c$, expressed via combination of fundamental physical constants.

Title: Dynamics of Cu$_2$O Rydberg excitons -- real density matrix approach
Authors: Karol Karpinski, Gerard Czajkowski
Abstract: Basing on recent reliable measurements of the life- and coherence time of Cu$_2$O Rydberg excitons, we present an analytical method which enables to describe the experimental results. The real-density matrix approach (RDMA) is applied to describe two-photon absorption in Cu$_2$O through the excitonic response to the exciting fields. This approach produces an analytical expression for the emission intensity time evolution, and can be used to explain trends in reported experimental data. Our approach takes into account the effect of the coherence between the electron-hole pair and the electromagnetic fields, the quantum beats and the life- and coherence time dependence on the applied laser power. Adding a separation of slow- and rapid dynamics components we find excellent agreement with the experimental data.

Title: Efficient optimization of variational tensor-network approach to three-dimensional statistical systems
Authors: Xia-Ze Xu, Tong-Yu Lin, Guang-Ming Zhang
Abstract: Variational tensor network optimization has become a powerful tool for studying classical statistical models in two dimensions. However, its application to three-dimensional systems remains limited, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with evaluating the free energy density and its gradient. This process requires contracting a triple-layer tensor network composed of a projected entangled pair operator and projected entangled pair states. In this paper, we employ a split corner-transfer renormalization group scheme tailored for the contraction of such triple-layer networks, which reduces the computational complexity from $\mathcal{O}(D^{12})$ in conventional methods to $\mathcal{O}(D^{9})$. Through numerical benchmarks on the three-dimensional classical Ising model, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves numerical results comparable to the most recent Monte Carlo simulations, while also providing a substantial speedup over previous variational tensor network approaches. This makes this method well-suited for efficient gradient-based optimization in three-dimensional tensor network simulations.

Title: Tunable phase transitions from semimetals to Chern insulators in two-dimensional quadratic-band-crossing materials
Authors: Wen-Hao Bian, Jing Wang
Abstract: We systematically investigate how static symmetry-breaking perturbations and dynamic Floquet terms via a polarized light manipulate the topological phase transitions in the two-dimensional quadratic-band-crossing-point (QBCP) materials. The Berry curvature shows distinct behavior in such two situations. It is linearly and quadratically proportional to the product of microstructural parameters $t_{x,z}$ for the former and the latter, respectively. The static perturbation eliminates the QBCP and opens an energy gap, which leads to the momentum-inversion symmetry of Berry curvature. This yields a nontrivial Chern number determined by the microstructural parameters. In contrast, we demonstrate that either a circularly or an elliptically polarized light breaks the time-reversal symmetry, transforming the QBCP semimetal into a Chern insulator with a quantized anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy} = Ce^2/\hbar$, where the Chern number is governed by the polarization angle. Moreover, the linear polarization preserves the central antisymmetry of the Berry curvature, giving rise to a topological trivial insulator. These results establish a tunable topological phase transition from a QBCP semimetal to Chern insulator in the two-dimensional QBCP materials.

Title: Exchange-correlation torques from gauge symmetries
Authors: Jacques K. Desmarais, Kamel Bencheikh, Giovanni Vignale, Stefano Pittalis
Abstract: The problem of predicting accurate exchange-correlation (xc) spin-torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is extraneous to SDFT. Furthermore, SDFT does not apply in the presence of vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the physical implications of the U(1)xSU(2) gauge invariance of the xc energy in SpinCurrent-DFT. We derive explicit xc torque expressions based on meta-generalized-gradient approximations in the framework of the generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) formulation. One key term represents an xc-torque involving the GKS spin-kinetic energy density; and another term resembles the phenomenological spin current of the Landau-Lifshitz equations: both are derived from first-principles. We also show that the functional form ensures that the GKS particle- and spin-currents are identical, in form, to their interacting counterparts. Non-collinear equilibrium conditions and adiabatic dynamics are thus derived that resolve longstanding issues.

Title: Towards a two-scale model for morphogenesis -- How cellular processes influence tissue deformations
Authors: Lea Happel, Axel Voigt
Abstract: We propose a two-scale model to resolve essential features of developmental tissue deformations. The model couples individual cellular behavior to the mechanics at tissue scale. This is realized by a multiphase-field model addressing the motility, deformability and interaction of cells on an evolving surface. The surface evolution is due to bending elasticity, with bending properties influenced by the topology of the cellular network, which forms the surface. We discuss and motivate model assumptions, propose a numerical scheme, which essentially scales with the number of cells, and explore computationally the effect of the two-scale coupling on the global shape evolution. The approach provides a step towards more quantitative modeling of morphogenetic processes.

Title: Rare-earth atoms on Nb(110) as a platform to engineer topological superconductivity
Authors: David Antognini Silva, Yu Wang, Nicolae Atodiresei, Felix Friedrich, Stefan Blügel, Matthias Bode, Philipp Rüßmann, Artem Odobesko
Abstract: Helical spin textures in one-dimensional magnetic chains on superconductors can enable topological superconductivity and host Majorana zero modes, independent of the presence of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Here, we show that gadolinium (Gd) adatoms, possessing large 4f magnetic moments when placed on a Nb(110) surface, establish indirect exchange interactions mediated by valence electrons, manifesting as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy with density functional theory, we analyze the emergence of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in single Gd atoms and Gd dimers and uncover the underlying magnetic interaction mechanisms, on the basis of which we predict by means of spin-dynamics simulations the formation of stable chiral Néel-type spin-spiral configurations in Gd chains. These findings highlight rare-earth magnets as a promising platform for precisely tuning spin-spiral ground states, an essential prerequisite for the realization of topological superconductivity.

Title: Long-term atomistic finite-temperature substitutional diffusion
Authors: Shashank Saxena, Prateek Gupta, Dennis M. Kochmann
Abstract: Simulating long-term mass diffusion kinetics with atomic precision is important to predict chemical and mechanical properties of alloys over time scales of engineering interest in applications, including (but not limited to) alloy heat treatment, corrosion resistance, and hydrogen embrittlement. We present a new strategy to bridge from the time scale of atomic vibrations to that of vacancy-mediated atomic hops by a combination of statistical mechanics-based Gaussian phase packets (GPP) relaxation and a nudged elastic band (NEB)-facilitated harmonic transition state theory (H-TST) time update. We validate the approach by simulating bulk self-diffusion in copper and the segregation of vacancies and magnesium to a stacking fault and a symmetric tilt grain boundary in aluminum, modeled with an embedded atom method (EAM) potential. The method correctly predicts the kinetics in bulk copper and equilibrium impurity concentrations in aluminum, in agreement with the Langmuir-Mclean solution in the dilute limit. Notably, this technique can reach realistic diffusion time scales of days, weeks, and even years in a computational time of hours, demonstrating its capability to study the long-term chemo-thermo-mechanically coupled behavior of atomic ensembles.

Title: Elastic heterogeneity governs anomalous scaling in a soft porous crystal
Authors: Kota Mitsumoto, Kyohei Takae
Abstract: Nanoscale molecular transport plays a crucial role in regulating mass diffusion and responsiveness in condensed matter systems. In soft porous crystals, in particular, adsorption of guest molecules induces host framework deformation and changes in rigidity, underpinning their characteristic stimuli-responsive behaviour. Surface-mediated adsorption leads to inhomogeneous adsorbate distribution, which, through local framework deformation, induces spatial variations in rigidity -- elastic heterogeneity. Although this heterogeneity is expected to affect adsorption kinetics and mechanical behaviour, its role remains poorly understood. Here we show that elastic heterogeneity governs adsorption kinetics, leading to emergent phenomena including size-dependent uptake, surface creasing, and anomalous dynamic scaling that is distinct from established scaling. Stress relaxation near corners facilitates adsorption, resulting in a size-dependent deviation from diffusive kinetics. Away from corners, flexible unadsorbed regions between rigid adsorbed domains relieve stress through crease formation. The resulting lateral correlations exhibit anomalous dynamic scaling, characterized by a breakdown of scale invariance between global and local interfacial fluctuations. These findings provide a mechanistic foundation for controlling adsorption and deformation kinetics in soft porous materials via elastic heterogeneity. Our work opens a route to engineering responsive materials, where mechanical feedback is harnessed to control cooperative molecular transport and drive macroscopic shape changes under external perturbations.

Title: Tailoring Magnetic Properties of Zigzag Structured Thin Films via Interface Engineering and Columnar Nano-structuring
Authors: Sharanjeet Singh, Manisha Priyadarsini, Anup Kumar Bera, Smritiparna Ghosh, Varimalla R. Reddy, Sarathlal Koyiloth Vayalil, Benedikt Sochor, Dileep Kumar
Abstract: We report the emergence of a novel interface-induced shape anisotropy component in zigzag-structured thin films fabricated via Sequential Oblique Angle Deposition (S-OAD). In this study, we systematically investigate cobalt (Co) and Co2FeAl (CFA) thin films by varying column length, number of bilayers, and magneto-crystalline anisotropy (MCA) to explore how structural modulation affects magnetic behavior. Using magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements in conjunction with synchrotron-based grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) and 2D X-ray diffraction (2DXRD), we reveal that the interplay between interface-induced, shape, and crystalline anisotropies allows for a tunable magnetic response, ranging from isotropic to anisotropic behavior. The observed uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA) exceeds that of conventional OAD films, while column merging is effectively suppressed through precise multilayer engineering. Structural analysis confirms that periodic, high-density interfaces at the junctions of oppositely tilted columns are central to this anisotropy control. These findings demonstrate that interface engineering and columnar nanostructuring within zigzag nanostructures offer a powerful route for tailoring magnetic properties in zigzag thin films, enabling their application in next-generation spintronic and magnetic sensor technologies.

Title: Machine Learning Accelerates Raman Computations from Molecular Dynamics for Materials Science
Authors: David A. Egger, Manuel Grumet, Tomáš Bučko
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a powerful experimental technique for characterizing molecules and materials that is used in many laboratories. First-principles theoretical calculations of Raman spectra are important because they elucidate the microscopic effects underlying Raman activity in these systems. These calculations are often performed using the canonical harmonic approximation which cannot capture certain thermal changes in the Raman response. Anharmonic vibrational effects were recently found to play crucial roles in several materials, which motivates theoretical treatments of the Raman effect beyond harmonic phonons. While Raman spectroscopy from molecular dynamics (MD-Raman) is a well-established approach that includes anharmonic vibrations and further relevant thermal effects, MD-Raman computations were long considered to be computationally too expensive for practical materials computations. In this perspective article, we highlight that recent advances in the context of machine learning have now dramatically accelerated the involved computational tasks without sacrificing accuracy or predictive power. These recent developments highlight the increasing importance of MD-Raman and related methods as versatile tools for theoretical prediction and characterization of molecules and materials.

Abstract: We consider the Blume-Capel model in the scaling limit to realize the thermal perturbation of the tricritical Ising fixed point. We develop a numerical scaling-limit extrapolation for one-point functions and Rényi entropies in the ground state. In a mass quench scenario, we found long-living oscillations despite the absence of explicit spin-flip symmetry breaking or confining potential. We construct form factors of branch-point twist fields in the paramagnetic phase. In the scaling limit of small quenches, we verify form factor predictions for (i) the energy density and leading magnetic field using the dynamics of one-point functions, and (ii) branch-point twist fields using the dynamics of Rényi entropies.

Title: Effective Interactions in Quasi-One-Dimensional Dipolar Quantum Gases
Authors: Michał Zdziennicki, Mateusz Ślusarczyk, Krzysztof Pawłowski, Krzysztof Jachymski
Abstract: Ultracold dipolar atoms and molecules provide a flexible quantum simulation platform for studying strongly interacting many-body systems. Determining microscopic Hamiltonian parameters of the simulator is crucial for it to be useful. We study effective interactions emerging in quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) dipolar quantum gases, revealing significant nonuniversal corrections to the commonly used 1D pseudopotential. We demonstrate that a full 3D treatment employing realistic interaction potentials is essential for describing the reduced-dimensional system. Our findings are particularly relevant to experiments probing excited states and nonequilibrium phenomena.

Title: Long-range Order in a Short-range Quasi-2D XY Model
Authors: Minghui Hu, Chao Zhang, Dajun Zhang, Yanan Sun, Youjin Deng, Jian-Ping Lv
Abstract: The phase of spins in the quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) XY model has emerged as a topic of significant interest across multiple physics subfields. Here, we propose a short-range (SR) Q2D XY model defined on a plane perpendicularly intersected by a group of parallel planes, with each plane consisting of nearest-neighbor-coupled XY spins. We perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations to establish the full phase diagram of the Q2D XY model, aided by finite-size scaling. A long-range (LR) ordered phase emerges in the Q2D model when the spins on the parallel planes develop a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical phase. In the LR ordered phase, ordering is anisotropic: LR correlations develop along the direction of the intersection lines, while critical correlations emerge perpendicular to them. Furthermore, the LR ordered phase exhibits Goldstone-mode physics. Our study hence reveals the existence of LR order in a Q2D XY model with finite SR couplings and opens up a new avenue to explore superfluid orders in low dimensions.

Title: Valley resolved optical spectroscopy and coherent excitation of quantum Hall edge states in graphene
Authors: Ashutosh Singh, Maria Sebastian, Mikhail Tokman, Alexey Belyanin
Abstract: We show that chiral edge states in graphene under Quantum Hall effect conditions can be selectively probed and excited by terahertz or infrared radiation with single-quasiparticle sensitivity without affecting bulk states. Moreover, valley-selective excitation of edge states is possible with high fidelity. The underlying physical mechanism is the inevitable violation of adiabaticity and inversion symmetry breaking for electron states near the edge. This leads to the formation of Landau level-specific and valley-specific absorbance spectral peaks that are spectrally well separated from each other and from absorption by the bulk states, and have different polarization selection rules. Furthermore, inversion symmetry breaking enables coherent driving of chiral edge photocurrents due to second-order nonlinear optical rectification which becomes allowed in the electric dipole approximation.

Title: Probing Phonon Modes in Reconstructed twisted Homo and Hetero Bilayer System
Authors: Sushil Kumar Sahu, Robin Bajaj, Syed Ummair Ali, Ajay Bhut, Roshan Jesus Mathew, Shinjan Mandal, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Manish Jain, Chandan Kumar
Abstract: Twist angle engineering in van der Waals homo and hetero-bilayers introduces profound modifications in their electronic, optical and mechanical properties due to lattice reconstruction. In these systems, the interlayer coupling and atomic rearrangement strongly depend on the twist angle, leading to the formation of periodic Moire superlattices. At small twist angles, significant lattice relaxation results in the emergence of domain structures separated by one dimensional soliton networks, influencing electronic band structures and phonon modes. Here we systematically investigate the impact of lattice reconstruction on phonon renormalization in twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG,homo) and graphene-hBN Moire superlattices(hetero). Using Raman spectroscopy, we identify distinct phonon behaviours across different twist angle regimes. In TBLG, we observe the evolution of the G peak, including broadening, splitting, and the emergence of additional peaks in the small angle range 0.3 to 1 degree, attributed to Moire modified phonon interactions. At large twist angles, the peaks gradually merge back into a single feature, reflecting the reduced impact of lattice reconstruction. Similarly, in hBN graphene Moire superlattices, we detect Moire induced Raman peaks above and below the G peak, while the central G peak remains largely invariant to twist angle variation. The theoretical calculations uncover Moire phonon modes originating from different stacking regions providing insights into phonon renormalization. Our results establish a direct link between twist angle, lattice reconstruction, Moire phonons, and interlayer coupling, offering a fundamental framework for understanding phonon engineering in twisted bilayer systems. These findings pave the way for controlling phononic, optoelectronic and heat flow properties in next generation van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: Decoherence and fidelity enhancement during shuttling of entangled spin qubits
Authors: Yu-Ning Zhang, Aleksandr S. Mokeev, Viatcheslav V. Dobrovitski
Abstract: Shuttling of spin qubits between different locations is a key element in many prospective semiconductor systems for quantum information processing, but the shuttled qubits should be protected from decoherence created by time- and space-dependent noises. Since the paths of different spin qubits are interrelated, the noises acting on the shuttled spins exhibit complex and unusual correlations. We appraise the role of these correlations using the concept of trajectories on random sheets, and demonstrate that they can drastically affect efficiency of the coherence protection. These correlations can also be exploited to enhance the shuttling fidelity, and we show that by encoding logical qubit in a state of two consequtively shuttled entangled spins, high fidelity can be achieved even for very slow shuttling. We identify the conditions favoring this encoding, and quantify improvement in the shuttling fidelity in comparison with the single-spin shuttling.

Title: Massive Atomic Diversity: a compact universal dataset for atomistic machine learning
Authors: Arslan Mazitov, Sofiia Chorna, Guillaume Fraux, Marnik Bercx, Giovanni Pizzi, Sandip De, Michele Ceriotti
Abstract: The development of machine-learning models for atomic-scale simulations has benefited tremendously from the large databases of materials and molecular properties computed in the past two decades using electronic-structure calculations. More recently, these databases have made it possible to train universal models that aim at making accurate predictions for arbitrary atomic geometries and compositions. The construction of many of these databases was however in itself aimed at materials discovery, and therefore targeted primarily to sample stable, or at least plausible, structures and to make the most accurate predictions for each compound - e.g. adjusting the calculation details to the material at hand. Here we introduce a dataset designed specifically to train machine learning models that can provide reasonable predictions for arbitrary structures, and that therefore follows a different philosophy. Starting from relatively small sets of stable structures, the dataset is built to contain massive atomic diversity (MAD) by aggressively distorting these configurations, with near-complete disregard for the stability of the resulting configurations. The electronic structure details, on the other hand, are chosen to maximize consistency rather than to obtain the most accurate prediction for a given structure, or to minimize computational effort. The MAD dataset we present here, despite containing fewer than 100k structures, has already been shown to enable training universal interatomic potentials that are competitive with models trained on traditional datasets with two to three orders of magnitude more structures. We describe in detail the philosophy and details of the construction of the MAD dataset. We also introduce a low-dimensional structural latent space that allows us to compare it with other popular datasets and that can be used as a general-purpose materials cartography tool.

Title: The electronic structure of a doped Mott-Hubbard surface
Authors: Mattia Iannetti, Silvio Modesti, Giovanni Di Santo, Marco Caputo, Polina M. Sheverdyaeva, Paolo Moras, Fabio Chiapolino, Tommaso Cea, Cesare Tresca, Erio Tosatti, Gianni Profeta
Abstract: The Sn/Si(111)-({\sqrt}3{\times}{\sqrt}3)R30° surface, a 2D Mott insulator, has long been predicted and then found experimetally to metallize and even turn superconducting upon boron doping. In order to clarify the structural, spectroscopic and theoretical details of that evolution, here we present ARPES data supplementing morphology and scanning tunneling measurements. These combined experimental results are compared with predictions from a variety of electronic structure approaches, mostly density functional DFT+U, but not neglecting Mott-Hubbard models, both ordered and disordered. These theoretical pictures address different spectroscopic aspects, including the 2D Fermi surface, the Hubbard bands, etc. While no single picture account for all observations at once,the emergent hypothesis compatible with all data is that metallization arises from sub-subsurface boron doping, additional to the main standard subsurface boron geometry, that would leave the surface insulating. These results advance the indispensable frame for the further understanding of this fascinating system.

Title: Striped excitonic (super)solid in anisotropic semiconductors with screened exciton interactions
Authors: J. F. de Oliveira Neto, F. M. A. Guimarães, Davi S. Dantas, F. M. Peeters, M. V. Milošević, A. Chaves
Abstract: Within the Gross-Pitaevskii framework, we reveal the emergence of a crystallized phase of an exciton condensate in an atomically-thin anisotropic semiconductor, where screening of exciton-exciton interactions is introduced by a proximal doped graphene layer. While such screened interactions are expected to yield a hexagonal crystal lattice in the excitonic condensate in isotropic semiconductor quantum wells [see e.g. Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{108}, 060401 (2012)], here we show that for atomically thin semiconductors with strong electronic anisotropy, such as few-layer black phosphorus, the crystallized exciton phase acquires a parallel stripe structure - unanticipated to date. The optimal conditions for the emergence of this phase, as well as for its coexistence with excitonic superfluidity in a striped supersolid phase, are identified.

Title: Flexoelectric Polarization Enhancement in Paraelectric $\mathrm{BaHfO_3}$ via Strain Gradient Engineering
Authors: Timo Piecuch, Jeffrey A. Brock, Xiaochun Huang, Arnold M. Müller, Christof Vockenhuber, Christof W. Schneider, Thomas Lippert, Nick A. Shepelin
Abstract: Flexoelectricity - polarization induced by strain gradients - offers a route to polar functionality in centrosymmetric dielectrics, where traditional piezoelectric effects are absent. This study investigates the flexoelectric effect in epitaxial $\mathrm{BaHfO_3}$ (BHO) thin films, a centrosymmetric and paraelectric perovskite. While a large lattice mismatch induces defect-driven relaxation, a coherently grown BHO film undergoes elastic relaxation, forming intrinsic strain gradients exceeding $10^6\ \mathrm{m}^{-1}$. A 29-fold enhancement in spontaneous polarization is observed at an electric field of $4\ \mathrm{MV\,cm}^{-1}$ for BHO exhibiting a strain gradient compared to relaxed BHO. This enhancement is attributed to flexoelectric coupling, which is isolated from ferroelectric and piezoelectric contributions due to the centrosymmetric nature and the absence of phase transitions in BHO. The findings establish a clear link between engineered strain gradients and enhanced polarizability in oxide thin films, offering a benchmark system for deconvoluting the flexoelectric effect from other polar effects. These results provide a basis for exploiting flexoelectricity in dielectric devices and advance the fundamental understanding of strain-coupled phenomena in functional oxides.

Title: Orbital FFLO and layer-selective FFLO phases in trilayer NbSe$_2$
Authors: Michiya Chazono, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: Finite-momentum superconductivity has become an important research topic in condensed matter physics. In particular, the orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, which is stabi lized in atomically thin films by the orbital effect of an external magnetic field, has been getting attention as a fascinating finite-momentum superconducting state recently. We study the phase diagram of the trilayer Ising superconductor NbSe$_2$ in the in-plane magnetic field, taking into ac count the orbital effect, the paramagnetic effect, and the spin-orbit coupling. The finite-momentum gap structure in the high-field region is shown by a large-scale numerical calculation based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. We find an exotic superconducting phase, a layer-selective FFLO phase, in which finite-momentum Cooper pairs coexist with zero-momentum Cooper pairs, separated from the orbital FFLO phase.

Title: Cluster Spin Glass State in Ba$_3$Sb$_{1+x}$Co$_{2-x}$O$_{9-δ}$: Cation Disorder and Mixed-Valence Co Dimers
Authors: Anzar Ali, Guratinder Kaur, Lukas Keller, Masahiko Isobe
Abstract: We investigate the structural, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties of \BSCO\ ($x$ = 0.04, $\delta$ = 0.54), a hexagonal perovskite featuring face-sharing CoO$_6$ octahedra that forms Co dimers. DC and AC magnetization measurements reveal a frequency-dependent spin-freezing transition consistent with glassy dynamics. AC susceptibility fits best to the Vogel-Fulcher model, indicating collective freezing of interacting spin clusters. Isothermal magnetization follows the Langevin function, suggesting finite-sized magnetic clusters rather than isolated paramagnetic moments. Non-equilibrium dynamics, evidenced by thermoremanent magnetization and memory effects, further support a spin-glass-like state. Heat capacity shows no sharp anomalies, and neutron powder diffraction confirms the absence of magnetic Bragg peaks down to 1.5~K, ruling out long-range magnetic order. Rietveld refinement reveals significant Co/Sb intersite disorder ($\sim$~30\pct) and oxygen non-stoichiometry, introducing exchange randomness and frustration that drive the spin-glass-like behavior. Electrical resistivity exhibits Arrhenius-type temperature dependence with an activation energy of 0.173~eV, consistent with semiconducting behavior. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction shows no structural phase transitions, confirming that the spin-glass-like state is not lattice-driven. Our results establish \BSCO\ as a cluster spin-glass candidate, where Co dimers, disorder, and geometric frustration prevent long-range order, leading to slow spin dynamics. These findings highlight the role of cation disorder and oxygen vacancies in stabilizing unconventional magnetic states in cobalt-based hexagonal perovskites.

Title: Exploring Low-Dimensional Magnetism in Cobalt Vanadates, ${A}$CoV$_{2}$O$_{7}$~(${A}$~=~Ca, Sr) : Crystal Growth and Magnetic Properties of Effective Spin-1/2 Zigzag Chains
Authors: Anzar Ali, Guratinder Kaur, Arvind Maurya, Isha, Kathrin Küster, Ulrich Starke, Pascal Puphal, Arvind Kumar Yogi, Masahiko Isobe
Abstract: We report the successful growth of high-quality single crystals of \ACVO, a quasi-one-dimensional zigzag chain compound containing Co$^{2+}$ ions, using the optical floating zone method. The crystal growth was stabilized under high-pressure argon-oxygen gas with slow growth rates, overcoming challenges associated with the incongruent melting behavior of this material. X-ray diffraction confirms the zigzag arrangement of Co$^{2+}$ ions, forming a quasi-one-dimensional chain structure. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements reveal an antiferromagnetic phase transition at the Néel temperature ($T_{\text{N}} \sim 3.5$ K) and negative Curie-Weiss temperatures, indicative of dominant antiferromagnetic interactions. The distorted CoO$_6$ octahedral geometry and strong spin-orbit coupling suggest that Co$^{2+}$ ions likely exhibit an effective $J = 1/2 $ Kramers doublet state. The results presented here demonstrate the potential of \ACVO\ as a platform for investigating low-dimensional magnetism and quantum magnetic phenomena. These insights shed light on the role of the ${A}$-site ion in tuning the magnetic interactions, which will foster future research into the field-induced behavior in these cobalt vanadates.

Title: Moiré Collapse and Luttinger Liquids In Twisted Anisotropic Homobilayers
Authors: D. J. P. de Sousa, Seungjun Lee, Francisco Guinea, Tony Low
Abstract: We introduce twisted anisotropic homobilayers as a distinct class of moiré systems, characterized by a distinctive ``magic angle", $\theta_M$, where both the moiré unit cell and Brillouin zone collapse. Unlike conventional studies of moiré materials, which primarily focus on small lattice misalignments, we demonstrate that this moiré collapse occurs at large twist angles in generic twisted anisotropic homobilayers. The collapse angle, $\theta_M$, is likely to give rise quasi-crystal behavior as well as to the formation of strongly correlated states, that arise not from flat bands, but from the presence of ultra-anisotropic electronic states, where non-Fermi liquid phases can be stabilized. In this work, we develop a continuum model for electrons based on extensive \textit{ab initio} calculations for twisted bilayer black phosphorus, enabling a detailed study of the emerging moiré collapse features in this archetypal system. We show that the (temperature) stability criterion for the emergence of (sliding) Luttinger liquids is generally met as the twist angle approaches $\theta_M$. Furthermore, we explicitly formulate the collapsed single-particle one-dimensional (1D) continuum Hamiltonian and provide the \textit{fully interacting}, bosonized Hamiltonian applicable at low doping levels. Our analysis reveals a rich landscape of multichannel Luttinger liquids, potentially enhanced by valley degrees of freedom at large twist angles.

Title: Atomic layer etching of InGaAs using sequential exposures of atomic hydrogen and oxygen gas
Authors: Mete M. Bayrak, Anthony J. Ardizzi, Sadhvikas Addamane, Kieran Cleary, Austin J. Minnich
Abstract: The high frequency performance and yield of III-V semiconductor devices such as InP HEMTs is negatively impacted by subsurface etch damage and non-uniform etch depth over the wafer. Atomic layer etching (ALE) has the potential to overcome this challenge because of its ability to etch with Angstrom-scale precision, low damage, and intrinsic wafer-scale uniformity. Here, we report an ALE process for InGaAs based on sequential atomic hydrogen and oxygen gas exposures. An etch rate of 0.095 Å/cycle was observed at 350 °C using ex-situ spectroscopic ellipsometry. The sample remains atomically smooth after 200 cycles of ALE. This process could be employed as a gate recess etch step in InP HEMT fabrication to improve microwave performance and yield.

Title: Fast readout of quantum dot spin qubits via Andreev spins
Authors: Michèle Jakob, Katharina Laubscher, Patrick Del Vecchio, Anasua Chatterjee, Valla Fatemi, Stefano Bosco
Abstract: Spin qubits in semiconducting quantum dots are currently limited by slow readout processes, which are orders of magnitude slower than gate operations. In contrast, Andreev spin qubits benefit from fast measurement schemes enabled by the large resonator couplings of superconducting qubits but suffer from reduced coherence during qubit operations. Here, we propose fast and high-fidelity measurement protocols based on an electrically-tunable coupling between quantum dot and Andreev spin qubits. In realistic devices, this coupling can be made sufficiently strong to enable high-fidelity readout well below microseconds, potentially enabling mid-circuit measurements. Crucially, the electrical tunability of our coupler permits to switch it off during idle periods, minimizing crosstalk and measurement back-action. Our approach is fully compatible with germanium-based devices and paves the way for scalable quantum computing architectures by leveraging the advantages of heterogeneous qubit implementations.

Title: Self-assembled clusters of mutually repelling particles in confinement
Authors: P. D. S. de Lima, R. De La Cour, K. Gaff, J. M. de Araújo, S. J. Cox, M. S. Ferreira, S. Hutzler
Abstract: Mutually repelling particles form spontaneously ordered clusters when forced into confinement. The clusters may adopt similar spatial arrangements even if the underlying particle interactions are contrastingly different. Here we demonstrate with both simulations and experiments that it is possible to induce particles of very different types to self-assemble into the same ordered geometric structure by simply regulating the ratio between the repulsion and confining forces. This is the case for both long- and short-ranged potentials. This property is initially explored in systems with two-dimensional (2D) circular symmetry and subsequently demonstrated to be valid throughout the transition to one-dimensional (1D) structures through continuous elliptical deformations of the confining field. We argue that this feature can be utilized to manipulate the spatial structure of confined particles, thereby paving the way for the design of clusters with specific functionalities.

Title: Resonances of recurrence time of monitored quantum walks
Authors: Ruoyu Yin, Qingyuan Wang, Sabine Tornow, Eli Barkai
Abstract: The recurrence time is the time a process first returns to its initial state. Using quantum walks on a graph, the recurrence time is defined through stroboscopic monitoring of the arrival of the particle to a node of the system. When the time interval between repeated measurements is tuned in such a way that eigenvalues of the unitary become degenerate, the mean recurrence time exhibits resonances. These resonances imply faster mean recurrence times, which were recorded on quantum computers. The resonance broadening is captured by a restart uncertainty relation [R. Yin, Q. Wang, S. Tornow, E. Barkai, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 122, e2402912121 (2025)]. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, we extend our investigation to include the impact of system size on the widened resonances, showing how the connectivity and energy spectrum structure of a system influence the restart uncertainty relation. Breaking the symmetry of the system, for example time-reversal symmetry breaking with a magnetic flux applied to a ring, removes the degeneracy of {the eigenvalues of the unitary}, hence modifying {the mean recurrence time and the widening of the transitions}, and this effect is studied in detail. The width of resonances studied here is related to the finite time resolution of relevant experiments on quantum computers, and to the restart paradigm.19

Title: Turquoise Magic Wavelength of the ${}^{87}$Sr Clock Transition
Authors: G. Kestler, R. J. Sedlik, E. C. Trapp, M. S. Safronova, J. T. Barreiro
Abstract: Optical lattice clocks of fermionic strontium offer a versatile platform for probing fundamental physics and developing quantum technologies. The bivalent electronic structure of strontium gives rise to a doubly-forbidden atomic transition that is accessible due to hyperfine mixing in fermionic strontium-87, thus resulting in a sub-millihertz natural linewidth. Currently, the most accurate optical lattice clocks operate on this narrow transition by tightly trapping strontium-87 atoms in a {\em magic} optical lattice at 813~nm. {\em Magic} wavelengths occur where the Stark shifts of both the ground and excited states are equivalent, thus eliminating any position and intensity-dependent broadening of the corresponding transition. Theoretical calculations of the electronic structure of strontium-87 have also predicted another {\em magic} wavelength of the clock transition at 497.01(57)~nm. In this work, we experimentally measure the novel {\em magic} wavelength to be $497.4363(3)$~nm. Compared to the 813~nm {\em magic} wavelength, 497~nm is closer to the strong 461~nm dipolar transition of strontium, resulting in larger atomic polarizability by an order of magnitude, providing deeper traps with less optical power. The proximity to the 461~transition also leads to an enhanced sensitivity of 334(10)~Hz/(nm\,$E_{R}$) at the {\em magic} wavelength.

Title: Universal framework with exponential speedup for the quantum simulation of quantum field theories including QCD
Authors: Jad C. Halimeh, Masanori Hanada, Shunji Matsuura
Abstract: We present a quantum simulation framework universally applicable to a wide class of quantum systems, including quantum field theories such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, we generalize an efficient quantum simulation protocol developed for bosonic theories in [Halimeh et al., arXiv:2411.13161] which, when applied to Yang-Mills theory, demonstrated an exponential resource advantage with respect to the truncation level of the bosonic modes, to systems with both bosons and fermions using the Jordan-Wigner transform and also the Verstraete-Cirac transform. We apply this framework to QCD using the orbifold lattice formulation and achieve an exponential speedup compared to previous proposals. As a by-product, exponential speedup is achieved in the quantum simulation of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian, the latter being a special limit of the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian. In the case of Hamiltonian time evolution of a theory on an $L^d$ spatial lattice via Trotterization, one Trotter step can be realized using $\mathcal{O}(L^d)$ numbers of CNOT gates, Hadamard gates, phase gates, and one-qubit rotations. We show this analytically for any matter content and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge group with any $N$. Even when we use the Jordan-Wigner transform, we can utilize the cancellation of quantum gates to significantly simplify the quantum circuit. We also discuss a block encoding of the Hamiltonian as a linear combination of unitaries using the Verstraete-Cirac transform. Our protocols do not assume oracles, but rather present explicit constructions with rigorous resource estimations without a hidden cost, and are thus readily implementable on a quantum computer.

Title: Dissipative quantum North-East-Center model: steady-state phase diagram, universality and nonergodic dynamics
Authors: Pietro Brighi, Alberto Biella
Abstract: In this work we study the dissipative quantum North-East-Center (NEC) model: a two-dimensional spin-1/2 lattice subject to chiral, kinetically constrained dissipation and coherent quantum interactions. This model combines kinetic constraints and chirality at the dissipative level, implementing local incoherent spin flips conditioned by an asymmetric majority-vote rule. Through a cluster mean-field approach, we determine the steady-state phase diagram of the NEC model under different Hamiltonians, consistently revealing the emergence of two distinct phases, bistable and normal, across all cases considered. We further investigate the stability of the steady-state with respect to inhomogeneous fluctuations in both phases, showing the emergence of instabilities at finite wavevectors in the proximity of the phase transition. Next, we study the nonergodicity of the model in the bistable phase. We characterize the dynamics of minority islands of spins surrounded by a large background of spins pointing in the opposite direction. We show that in the bistable phase, the minority islands are always reabsorbed by the surrounding at a constant velocity, irrespectively of their size. Finally, we propose and numerically benchmark an equation of motion for the reabsorption velocity of the islands where thermal and quantum fluctuations act independently at linear order.

Title: Geometry of Chord Intertwiner, Multiple Shocks and Switchback in Double-Scaled SYK
Authors: Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez, Jiuci Xu
Abstract: We revisit the bulk Hilbert space interpretation of chords in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model and introduce a notion of intertwiner that constructs bulk states from states with fixed boundary conditions. This leads to an isometric map that factorizes the one-particle bulk Hilbert space into a tensor product of two boundary Hilbert spaces without particle insertion. The map enables a systematic derivation of a family of correlation functions with arbitrary finite amount of matter insertions, relevant for capturing the switchback effect-a feature of holographic complexity. We further develop a path integral framework that describes multiple shockwave configurations in the semiclassical limit. For the two-body scattering processes in semi-classical regime, we show it exhibits sub-maximal chaos at finite temperature, consistent with the scramblon dynamics associated with the "fake disk" geometry. The effective "fake temperature" governing this behavior emerges from the semiclassical limit of the quantum $6 j$-symbol associated with the out-of-time-order correlator. We further analyze multi-shockwave configurations and derive precise conditions under which the switchback effect is realized, both in terms of the total chord number and the Krylov complexity of precursor operators. Our results clarify the structure of correlation functions with multiple operator insertions, their bulk interpretation in terms of shockwave geometries in the semiclassical regime, and provide a microscopic derivation of the switchback effect in the DSSYK model.

Title: Entropy from scattering in weakly interacting systems
Authors: Duncan MacIntyre, Gordon W. Semenoff
Abstract: Perturbation theory is used to investigate the evolution of the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem of a bipartite quantum system in the course of a gedanken scattering experiment. We find surprisingly simple criteria for the initial state and the scattering matrix that guarantee that the subsystem entropy increases. The class of states that meet these criteria are more correlated than simple product states of the subsystems. They form a subclass of the set of all separable states, and they can therefore be assembled by classical processes alone.

Title: Local Learning Rules for Out-of-Equilibrium Physical Generative Models
Authors: Cyrill Bösch, Geoffrey Roeder, Marc Serra-Garcia, Ryan P. Adams
Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned via a local learning rule. The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol are computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a network of 10x10 oscillators to sample images of 0s and 1s from the MNIST dataset.

Title: Efficient Berry Phase Calculation via Adaptive Variational Quantum Computing Approach
Authors: Martin Mootz, Yong-Xin Yao
Abstract: We present a quantum computing approach for efficiently calculating the Berry phase in topological Hamiltonians. Our method leverages cyclic adiabatic evolution of the Hamiltonian and employs adaptive variational quantum algorithms for state preparation and evolution, optimizing circuit efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. We benchmark our approach on dimerized Fermi-Hubbard chains with four sites, demonstrating precise Berry phase simulations in both noninteracting and interacting regimes. Our results show that circuit depths reach up to 106 layers for noninteracting systems and increase to 279 layers for interacting systems due to added complexity. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our scheme across a wide range of parameters governing adiabatic evolution and variational algorithm. These findings highlight the potential of adaptive variational quantum algorithms for advancing quantum simulations of topological materials and computing geometric phases in strongly correlated systems.

Title: An information-theoretic proof of the Planckian bound for thermalization
Authors: Paolo Abiuso, Alberto Rolandi, John Calsamiglia, Pavel Sekatski, Martí Perarnau-Llobet
Abstract: We demonstrate that quantum mechanics entails a fundamental lower bound on the thermalization time $\tau$ of any system. At finite temperature, we show that $\tau$ is bounded by half the Planckian dissipation time, $\tau \geq \tau_{\rm Pl}/2$ with $\tau_{\rm Pl} = \hbar/(k_{\rm B} T)$. In the low-temperature regime, our bound takes the form $\tau \geq \hbar / \Delta$ with $\Delta$ the spectral gap, in close connection with the quantum adiabatic theorem. These bounds, rooted in Hamiltonian estimation, hold for arbitrary quantum processes that output states close to the corresponding thermal ensemble for a nontrivial class of Hamiltonians.

Title: Long-Range Interacting Particles on a Helix: A Statistical and Correlation Analysis of Equilibrium Configurations
Authors: J.M. Dörre, F.K. Diakonos, P. Schmelcher
Abstract: We provide a statistical and correlational analysis of the spatial and energetic properties of equilibrium configurations of a few-body system of two to eight equally charged classical particles that are confined on a one-dimensional helical manifold. The two-body system has been demonstrated to yield an oscillatory effective potential, thus providing stable equilibrium configurations despite the repulsive Coulomb interactions. As the system size grows, the number of equilibria increases, approximately following a power-law. This can be attributed to the increasing complexity in the highly non-linear oscillatory behavior of the potential energy surface. This property is reflected in a crossover from a spatially regular distribution of equilibria for the two-body system to a heightened degree of disorder upon the addition of particles. However, in accordance with the repulsion within a helical winding, the observed interparticle distances in equilibrium configurations cluster around values of odd multiples of half a helical winding, thus maintaining an underlying regularity. Furthermore, an energetic hierarchy exists based on the spatial location of the local equilibria, which is subject to increasing fluctuations as the system size grows.

Title: Deposition-Dependent Coverage and Performance of Phosphonic Acid Interface Modifiers in Halide Perovskite Optoelectronics
Authors: Hannah Contreras, Aidan O'Brien, Margherita Taddei, Yangwei Shi, Fangyuan Jiang, Robert J. E. Westbrook, Yadong Zhang, Rajiv Giridharagopal, Paul A. Lee, Stephen Barlow, Seth R. Marder, Neal R. Armstrong, David S. Ginger
Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of various deposition methods for phosphonic acid interface modifiers commonly pursued as self-assembled monolayers in high-performance metal halide perovskite photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes. We compare the deposition of (2-(3,6-diiodo-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid onto indium tin oxide (ITO) bottom contacts by varying three parameters: the method of deposition, specifically spin coating or prolonged dip coating, ITO surface treatment via HCl/FeCl3 etching, and use in combination with a second modifier, 1,6-hexylenediphosphonic acid. We demonstrate that varying these modification protocols can impact time-resolved photoluminescence carrier lifetimes and quasi-Fermi level splitting of perovskite films deposited onto the phosphonic-acid-modified ITO. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy shows an increase in effective work function after phosphonic acid modification and clear evidence for photoemission from carbazole functional groups at the ITO surface. We use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to probe differences in phosphonic acid coverage on the metal oxide contact and show that perovskite samples grown on ITO with the highest phosphonic acid coverage exhibit the longest carrier lifetimes. Finally, we establish that device performance follows these same trends. These results indicate that the reactivity, heterogeneity, and composition of the bottom contact help to control recombination rates and therefore power conversion efficiencies. ITO etching, prolonged deposition times for phosphonic acids via dip coating, and the use of a secondary, more hydrophilic bis-phosphonic acid, all contribute to improvements in surface coverage, carrier lifetime, and device efficiency. These improvements each have a positive impact, and we achieve the best results when all three strategies are implemented.

Title: Rare dense solutions clusters in asymmetric binary perceptrons -- local entropy via fully lifted RDT
Authors: Mihailo Stojnic
Abstract: We study classical asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) and associated \emph{local entropy} (LE) as potential source of its algorithmic hardness. Isolation of \emph{typical} ABP solutions in SAT phase seemingly suggests a universal algorithmic hardness. Paradoxically, efficient algorithms do exist even for constraint densities $\alpha$ fairly close but at a finite distance (\emph{computational gap}) from the capacity. In recent years, existence of rare large dense clusters and magical ability of fast algorithms to find them have been posited as the conceptual resolution of this paradox. Monotonicity or breakdown of the LEs associated with such \emph{atypical} clusters are predicated to play a key role in their thinning-out or even complete defragmentation. Invention of fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [90,93,94] allows studying random structures \emph{typical} features. A large deviation upgrade, sfl LD RDT [96,97], moves things further and enables \emph{atypical} features characterizations as well. Utilizing the machinery of [96,97] we here develop a generic framework to study LE as an ABP's atypical feature. Already on the second level of lifting we discover that the LE results are closely matching those obtained through replica methods. For classical zero threshold ABP, we obtain that LE breaks down for $\alpha$ in $(0.77,0.78)$ interval which basically matches $\alpha\sim 0.75-0.77$ range that currently best ABP solvers can handle and effectively indicates that LE's behavior might indeed be among key reflections of the ABP's computational gaps presumable existence.

Title: Quantum Counting in the Rydberg Blockade
Authors: Joseph Gibson, Victor Drouin-Touchette, Stefanos Kourtis
Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for approximately counting the number of solutions to planar 2-satisfiability (2SAT) formulas natively on neutral atom quantum computers. Our algorithm maps Boolean variables to atomic registers arranged in space according to a given formula, so that 2SAT constraints are enforced via the Rydberg blockade between neighboring atoms. A quench under Rydberg dynamics of an initial computational basis state produces a superposition of all solutions after a sufficiently long evolution. For almost uniform superpositions, a polynomial number of measurements is enough to estimate the solution count up to any constant multiplicative factor via sampling based counting. We demonstrate numerically that this protocol leads to almost uniform solution sampling in 1D and 2D grids and that it produces accurate counts for 2SAT instances on punctured grids, suggesting its general applicability as a heuristic for #P-complete problems.

Title: Quantum simulation of thermodynamics: Maxwell relations for pair correlations
Authors: F. Rist, R. S. Watson, H. L. Nourse, B. J. Powell, K. V. Kheruntsyan
Abstract: Quantum simulators hold enormous promise for advancing the modelling of materials and understanding emergent physics, such as high temperature superconductivity and topological order. While correlation functions are, typically, straightforward to measure in quantum simulators, thermodynamic properties are not. This limits our ability to directly compare the results of quantum simulations to experiments on the materials being modelled. Maxwell relations are an extremely powerful tool for characterising complex materials, as they enable the determination of challenging-to-measure thermodynamic properties from more accessible ones. Here, we introduce generalised Maxwell relations that relate every thermodynamic quantity to a single local correlation function. We illustrate their utility by deducing the thermodynamic properties of several iconic quantum many-body models from pair correlation functions using the generalised Maxwell relations. We show that this {universal} approach is readily accessible in quantum simulators and suggest applications to condensed matter systems where thermodynamic measurements are challenging, such as atomically thin materials.

Title: Energy transport in holographic junctions
Authors: Yan Liu, Chuan-Yi Wang
Abstract: We study energy transport in a conformal junction connecting three 2D conformal field theories using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The holographic dual consists of three AdS$_3$ spacetimes joined along the worldsheet of a tensile string anchored at the junction. Within a specific range of string tension, where the bulk solution is uniquely determined, we find that all energy reflection and transmission coefficients vary monotonically with the string tension. Notably, the total energy transmission, which quantifies the energy flux from one CFT through the junction, is bounded above by the effective central charge associated with both the CFTs and the junction. Results for energy transport in conformal interfaces are recovered in a special limit. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to junctions connecting $N$ 2D CFTs.

Title: Electric-field Quantum Sensing Exploiting a Photogenerated Charge-transfer Triplet State in a Molecular Semiconductor
Authors: Niccolò Fontana, Mikhail V. Vaganov, Gabriel Moise, William K. Myers, Kun Peng, Arzhang Ardavan, Junjie Liu
Abstract: Molecular spin systems are promising platforms for quantum sensing due to their chemically tunable Hamiltonians, enabling tailored coherence properties and interactions with external fields. However, electric field sensing remains challenging owing to typically weak spin-electric coupling (SEC) and limited directional sensitivity. Addressing these issues using heavy atoms exhibiting strong atomic spin-orbit couplings (SOC) often compromises spin coherence times. Here, we demonstrate coherent electric field sensing using a photogenerated charge-transfer (CT) spin triplet state in the organic molecule ACRSA (10-phenyl-10H,10' H-spiro\[acridine-9,9'-anthracen]-10'-one). By embedding electric field pulses within a Hahn echo sequence, we coherently manipulate the spin triplet and extract both the magnitude and directional dependence of its SEC. The measured SEC strength is approximately, comparable to values reported in systems with strong atomic SOC, illustrating that heavy atoms are not a prerequisite for electric-field sensitivity of spin states. Our findings position organic CT triplets as chemically versatile and directionally sensitive quantum sensors of E-fields that function without atomic-SOC-mediated mechanisms.

Title: Voltage-Induced Oxidation for Enhanced Purity and Reproducibility of Quantum Emission in Monolayer 2D Materials
Authors: Sung-Joon Leea, Hsun-Jen Chuang, Kathleen M. McCreary, Mehmet A. Noyan, Berend T.Jonker
Abstract: We report a voltage-induced oxidation technique using conductive atomic force microscopy to enhance the single-photon purity and reproducibility of quantum emitters in monolayer tung-sten diselenide (WSe2). By applying a controlled electric field across a monolayer WSe2/poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) on a silicon substrate, localized oxidation is induced around nanoindented emitter sites in the WSe2. This treatment selectively suppresses defect-bound exciton emissions while preserving emission from pristine regions within the indentations. Photoluminescence and second-order correlation measurements at 18 K demonstrate a substantial increase in single-photon purity when comparing emitters from untreated and voltage-treated regions. Emitters from untreated regions showed average values of g2(0) near or above the 0.5 threshold. In contrast, emitters from voltage-treated regions exhibited g2(0) values consistently below 0.14, with most falling near 0.05, demonstrating high-purity single-photon emission well below the g2(0) < 0.5 threshold. This enhancement results from the oxidation-induced suppression of spurious luminescence from the area around the quantum emitter site that is spectrally degenerate with the single-photon wavelength. This approach offers nonvolatile, spatially selective control over the emitter environment without degrading the emission intensity, improving both purity and stability. It provides a scalable route for integrating high-quality quantum emitters in two-dimensional materials into photonic platforms. Integration with spectral tuning strategies such as strain engineering, local dielectric patterning, or electrostatic gating could further enable deterministic, wavelength-selective single-photon sources for advanced quantum photonic applications

Title: Uncovering the origin of bound state in the continuum
Authors: Zeyu Rao, Changling Zou, Yang Chen, Guangcan Guo, Ming Gong
Abstract: Bound state in the continuum (BIC) and quasi-BIC represent a remarkable class of wave functions that disobey conventional intuition by exhibiting spatially localized modes embedded in the continuum spectrum. In recent years, these states have found important applications in interdisciplinary systems as a non-radiating mode with ultra-long lifetime. In these applications, a key question is how to convert a quasi-BIC into an exact BIC, and what the general criterion is for this transition. In this work, we uncover its origin using two steps in a two-band model with an arbitrary confining potential. Firstly, we demonstrate that a bound state coupled to a continuum band can yield quasi-BIC. Then, we show that tuning the coupling between the bands can convert the quasi-BIC into an exact BIC. In our theory, the real and complex poles of the spectra have a clear physical meaning for the quasi- and exact BICs, and we give the general criterion for exact BICs. Unlike previous proposals, our theory requires neither symmetry protection nor topological constraints and can be extended to a multiband model, providing a new framework for realizing BICs and offering new insights for their design in different fields, including photonics, acoustics, ultracold atoms and Bose-Einstein condensate with and without many-body interactions.

Title: Characterizing quantum resourcefulness via group-Fourier decompositions
Authors: Pablo Bermejo, Paolo Braccia, Antonio Anna Mele, Nahuel L. Diaz, Andrew E. Deneris, Martin Larocca, M. Cerezo
Abstract: In this work we present a general framework for studying the resourcefulness in pure states for quantum resource theories (QRTs) whose free operations arise from the unitary representation of a group. We argue that the group Fourier decompositions (GFDs) of a state, i.e., its projection onto the irreducible representations (irreps) of the Hilbert space, operator space, and tensor products thereof, constitute fingerprints of resourcefulness and complexity. By focusing on the norm of the irrep projections, dubbed GFD purities, we find that low-resource states live in the small dimensional irreps of operator space, whereas high-resource states have support in more, and higher dimensional ones. Such behavior not only resembles that appearing in classical harmonic analysis, but is also universal across the QRTs of entanglement, fermionic Gaussianity, spin coherence, and Clifford stabilizerness. To finish, we show that GFD purities carry operational meaning as they lead to resourcefulness witnesses as well as to notions of state compressibility.

Title: Narrow-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling in the $^{3}\mathrm{P}_{2}$ metastable state of strontium
Authors: Chun-Chia Chen, Ryoto Takeuchi, Shoichi Okaba, Hidetoshi Katori
Abstract: We demonstrate narrow-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling of magnetically trapped strontium (Sr) in the $5s5p\,^{3}\textrm{P}_{2}$ state. A 641 nm standing-wave, blue-detuned from the $5s4d\,^{3}\textrm{D}_{3}$$\,\rightarrow$ $\,5p4d\,^{3}\textrm{F}_{4}$ transition, creates a dissipative optical lattice in the $^{3}\textrm{D}_{3}$ state. By combining Doppler cooling and Sisyphus cooling on the $5s5p\,^{3}\textrm{P}_{2}$$\,\rightarrow$ $5s4d\,^{3}\textrm{D}_{3}$ transition at 2.92 ${\mu}$m, we observed efficient cooling of magnetically trapped atoms. By optically pumping the atoms to the $5s5p\,^{3}\textrm{P}_{0}$ state, we facilitate continuous outcoupling via a moving optical lattice with two fold improvement in atom number. Our scheme applies to next-generation quantum sensors using continuous ultracold atomic beams.

Title: Interplay between Symmetry Breaking and Interactions in a Symmetry Protected Topological Phase
Authors: Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, Patrick Azaria
Abstract: We solve the one dimensional massive Thirring model or equivalently the sine-Gordon model in the repulsive regime with general Dirichlet boundary conditions, which are characterized by two boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}$ associated with the left and right boundaries respectively. In the presence of these boundary fields, which explicitly break the charge conjugation symmetry, the system exhibits a duality symmetry which changes the sign of the mass parameter $m_0$ and shifts the values of the boundary fields by $\phi_{L,R}\rightarrow \phi_{L,R}+\pi$. When the mass parameter $m_0<0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=0$, or equivalently due to duality symmetry, when the mass parameter $m_0>0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=\pi$, the system is at a trivial point. Here, the ground state is unique just as in the case of periodic boundary conditions. In contrast, when the mass parameter $m_0<0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=\pi$, and equivalently due to the duality symmetry, when the mass parameter $m_0>0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=0$, the system is at a topological point where it exhibits a symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, which is characterized by the existence of zero energy bound states at both the boundaries. For a given value of the mass parameter $m_0$, we find that these phases remain stable in the presence of symmetry breaking fields at the boundary, provided they are smaller than certain critical values which depend on the strength of the interactions in the bulk. Hence, we show that the stability of the SPT and trivial phases depends on the interplay of the symmetry breaking boundary field values and the bulk interaction strength.

Title: Weak unitary symmetries of open quantum dynamics: beyond quantum master equations
Authors: Calum A. Brown, Robert L. Jack, Katarzyna Macieszczak
Abstract: We consider Markovian open quantum dynamics with weak unitary symmetries. Starting from the quantum master equation for the system alone, it is known that the joint dynamics of the system and its environment can be obtained by dilation, leading to a closed dynamics for a continuous matrix product state. Performing counting measurements on the environment gives rise to stochastic dynamics of quantum trajectories for the system, which when averaged yield back the quantum master equation. In this work, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions under which the dynamics of these different descriptions retain the weak symmetry of the quantum master equation and we characterise the resulting symmetries of the different descriptions in terms of their generators. We find that the joint dynamics always features a separable symmetry directly related to that of the quantum master equation, but for quantum trajectories the corresponding symmetry is present only if the counting measurement satisfies certain conditions.

Title: High-Efficiency Tunable Microwave Photon Detector Based on a Semiconductor Double Quantum Dot Coupled to a Superconducting High-Impedance Cavity
Authors: Fabian Oppliger, Wonjin Jang, Aldo Tarascio, Franco De Palma, Christian Reichl, Werner Wegscheider, Ville F. Maisi, Dominik Zumbühl, Pasquale Scarlino
Abstract: High-efficiency single-photon detection in the microwave domain is a key enabling technology for quantum sensing, communication, and information processing. However, the extremely low energy of microwave photons (~{\mu}eV) presents a fundamental challenge, preventing direct photon-to-charge conversion as achieved in optical systems using semiconductors. Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) charge qubits offer a compelling solution due to their highly tunable energy levels in the microwave regime, enabling coherent coupling with single photons. In this work, we demonstrate microwave photon detection with an efficiency approaching 70% in the single-photon regime. We use a hybrid system comprising a double quantum dot (DQD) charge qubit electrostatically defined in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, coupled to a high-impedance Josephson junction (JJ) array cavity. We systematically optimize the hybrid device architecture to maximize the conversion efficiency, leveraging the strong charge-photon coupling and the tunable DQD tunnel coupling rates. Incoming cavity photons coherently excite the DQD qubit, which in turn generates a measurable electrical current, realizing deterministic photon-to-charge conversion. Moreover, by exploiting the independent tunability of both the DQD transition energy and the cavity resonance frequency, we characterize the system efficiency over a range of 3-5.2 GHz. Our results establish semiconductor-based cavity-QED architectures as a scalable and versatile platform for efficient microwave photon detection, opening new avenues for quantum microwave optics and hybrid quantum information technologies.

Title: Impact of static disorder on quasiparticle spectra: Debye-Waller, mean free path and potential fluctuation effects
Authors: Enrico Della Valle, Procopios Constantinou, Thorsten Schmitt, Matthias Muntwiler, Gabriel Aeppli, Vladimir N. Strocov
Abstract: ARPES is a widely used characterization technique in condensed matter physics, providing direct access to the single-electron spectral function of crystals, including their electronic band structure and Fermi surface. Measuring the band structure of novel quantum materials has been fundamentally important for determining, for example, non-trivial band topology or for identifying new classes of materials. A key challenge with these emerging quantum materials is that their initial crystalline quality is rarely optimized, which directly affects the spectra measured by ARPES. Here, we present a theoretical framework and experimental evidence addressing two common consequences of static disorder in photoemission experiments: the loss of coherent spectral weight and the broadening of spectral features. ARPES spectra can be understood as a sum of coherent and incoherent intensities, with their relative contributions controlled by atomic disorder. Under thermal disorder, the coherent intensity is exponentially suppressed as temperature increases, a phenomenon analogous to the Debye-Waller factor in diffraction, where Bragg peaks diminish in favor of diffuse scattering as disorder increases. In this work, we report a soft X-ray study of the deliberately disordered (via Ar ion sputtering) InAs(110) surface, characterized both by STM and LEED. We introduce a new framework that enables quantification of coherent photoemission intensity loss with increasing disorder, allowing both thermal and static disorder to be treated within a unified approach. Additionally, we identify a second major effect of disorder beyond lifetime broadening: inhomogeneous spectral broadening arising from local potential fluctuations. We show that such fluctuations increase the linewidths of the spectra of localized and delocalized states, and contribute to the suppression of ARPES intensity from states near the Fermi level.

Title: First-principle Study of Multiple Metastable Charge Ordering States in La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$
Authors: Nam Nguyen, Alex Taekyung Lee, Vijay Singh, Anh T. Ngo, Hyowon Park
Abstract: La doped SrFeO$_{3}$, La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$, exhibits a metal-to-insulator transition accompanied by both antiferromagnetic and charge ordering states along with the Fe-O bond disproportionation below a critical temperature near 200K. Unconventionally slow charge dynamics measured in this material near the critical temperature shows that its excited charge ordering states can exhibit novel electronic structures with nontrivial energy profiles. Here, we reveal possible metastable states of charge ordering structures in La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$ using the first-principle and climbing image nudged elastic band methods. In the strong correlation regime, La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a charge ordering state of the big-small-big pattern, consistent with the experimental measurement of this material at the low temperature. As the correlation effect becomes weak, we find at least two possible metastable charge ordering states with the distinct Fe-O bond disproportionation. Remarkably, a ferroelectric metallic state emerges with the small energy barrier of $\sim$7 meV, driven by a metastable CO state of the small-medium-big pattern. The electronic structures of these metastable charge ordering states are noticeably different from those of the ground-state. Our results can provide an insightful explanation to multiple metastable charge ordering states and the slow charge dynamics of this and related oxide materials.

Title: Even-in-magnetic field part of transverse resistivity as a probe of magnetic transitions
Authors: Antonin Badura, Dominik Kriegner, Eva Schmoranzerová, Karel Výborný, Miina Leiviskä, Rafael Lopes Seeger, Vincent Baltz, Daniel Scheffler, Sebastian Beckert, Ismaila Kounta, Lisa Michez, Libor Šmejkal, Jairo Sinova, Sebastian T. B. Goennenwein, Jakub Železný, Helena Reichlová
Abstract: The component of the resistivity tensor $\rho_{ij}$ corresponding to voltage transverse to both an applied current and a magnetic field can be separated into odd and even parts with respect to the applied magnetic field. The former contains information, for example, about the ordinary or anomalous Hall effect. The latter is often ascribed to experimental artefacts and ignored. Here, we show that upon suppressing these artefacts in carefully controlled experiments, useful information remains. We first investigate the well-explored ferromagnet CoFeB, where the even part of $\rho_{yx}$ contains a contribution from the anisotropic magnetoresistance, which we confirm by Stoner--Wohlfarth modelling. We then apply our approach to magnetotransport measurements of $\rm Mn_5Si_3$ thin films, which undergo a transition from non-collinear to an altermagnetic collinear state. In this material, the even part of the transverse signal is sizable only in the low-spin-symmetry phase below $\approx 80$~K. Transverse resistivity measurements thus offer a simple and readily available probe of magnetic order transitions.

Title: Van der Waals heterostructure configuration effect on exciton and thermoelectric characteristics
Authors: Eyasu Tadesse Muda, Tewodros Eyob Ada, Kenate Nemera Nigussa, Cecil N. M. Ouma
Abstract: A GW calculation based on a truncated Coulomb interaction with an added small q limit was applied to 2D van der Waals heterolayered structures, and the Kane dispersion model was used to determine the accurate band gap edge. All ab initio calculations were performed with the gpaw package. Our findings show that layering the same or different types of atoms with a vacuum in between has an enormous impact on band alignment, effective mass of holes and electrons, exciton binding energy, thermoelectric characteristics, density of hot electrons, and electronic band this http URL, layered interactions of the same kind constrain the configuration to have a direct band gap, whereas different kinds allow for an indirect gap, resulting in an indirect exciton with a greater binding energy due to the band confinement effect. Furthermore, the heterostructure of the highest configuration facilitates the relaxation of hot electrons by forming unoccupied states. This leads to a high density of hot electrons dispersing over unoccupied states, which lessens their sensitivity to temperature; in other words, thermal drop prolongs electron-hole pairing. $\mathrm{MoSe_{2}-MoS_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{MoSeSe-MoSSe}$ have an improved Seebeck coefficient among the various possible configurations because of their low heat conductivity, ability to produce a higher density of states and empty states, improved optical gap, and multiple excitation peaks that resemble the experimental photoluminescence spectrum.

Title: Probing the dichotomy between Yu-Shiba-Rusinov and Majorana bound states via conductance, quantum noise and $Δ_T$ noise
Authors: Sachiraj Mishra, Colin Benjamin
Abstract: We investigate charge and spin conductance, charge and spin quantum noise, along with charge and spin $\Delta_T$ noise, as diagnostic tools to distinguish Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states from Majorana-bound states (MBS) in a one-dimensional metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction. YSR states arise from magnetic impurities acting as spin-flippers within a trivial s-wave superconducting gap, while MBS emerge in topological superconductors, often leading to ambiguity in experiments where magnetic impurities mimic zero-energy MBS signatures. By replacing the trivial superconductor with a topological one exhibiting triplet pairing (e.g., chiral p or spinless p-wave nanowires), we identify robust and distinguishing features of YSR and MBS states. Our analysis demonstrates that combined measurements of both charge and spin conductance, charge and spin quantum noise, and their $\Delta_T$ noise counterparts offer unique and reliable signatures to differentiate YSR states from genuine MBS, thereby reducing false-positive interpretations in topological superconductivity experiments.

Title: Phase transitions in $q$-state clock model
Authors: Arpita Goswami, Ravi Kumar, Monikana Gope, Shaon Sahoo
Abstract: The $q-$state clock model, sometimes called the discrete $XY$ model, is known to show a second-order (symmetry breaking) phase transition in two-dimension (2D) for $q\le 4$ ($q=2$ corresponds to the Ising model). On the other hand, the $q\to\infty$ limit of the model corresponds to the $XY$ model, which shows the infinite order (non-symmetry breaking) Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition in 2D. Interestingly, the 2D clock model with $q\ge 5$ is predicted to show three different phases and two associated phase transitions. There are varying opinions about the actual characters of phases and the associated transitions. In this work, we develop the basic and higher-order mean-field (MF) theories to study the $q$-state clock model systematically. Our MF calculations reaffirm that, for large $q$, there are three phases: (broken) $\mathbb{Z}_q$ symmetric ferromagnetic phase at the low temperature, emergent $U(1)$ symmetric BKT phase at the intermediate temperature, and paramagnetic (disordered) phase at the high temperature. The phase transition at the higher temperature is found to be of the BKT type, and the other transition at the lower temperature is argued to be a large-order spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) type (the largeness of transition order yields the possibility of having some of the numerical characteristics of a BKT transition). The higher-order MF theory developed here better characterizes phases by estimating the spin-spin correlation between two neighbors.

Title: Theoretical insights into the role of lattice fluctuations on the excited behavior of lead halide perovskites
Authors: Yoonjae Park, Rohit Rana, Daniel Chabeda, Eran Rabani, David T. Limmer
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites have been extensively studied as a class of materials with unique optoelectronic properties. A fundamental aspect that governs optical and electronic behaviors within these materials is the intricate coupling between charges and their surrounding lattice. Unravelling the role of charge-lattice interactions on the optoelectronic properties in lead halide perovskites is necessary to understand their photophysics. Unlike traditional semiconductors where a harmonic approximation often suffices to capture lattice fluctuations, lead halide perovskites have a significant anharmonicity attributed from the rocking and tilting motions of inorganic framework. Thus, while there is broad consensus on the importance of the structural deformations and polar fluctuations on the behavior of charge carriers and quasiparticles, the strongly anharmonic nature of these fluctuations and their strong interactions render theoretical descriptions of lead halides perovskites challenging. In this Account, we review our recent efforts to understand how the soft, polar lattice of this class of materials alter their quasiparticle binding energies and fine structure, charge mobilities, and lifetimes of phonons and excess charges. Throughout, these are aimed at characterizing the interplay between lattice fluctuations and optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskites and are reviewed in the context of the effective models we have built, and the novel theoretical methods we have developed to understand bulk crystalline materials, as well as nanostructures, and lower dimensionality lattices. By integrating theoretical advances with experimental observations, the perspective we detail in this account provides a comprehensive picture that serves as both design principles for optoelectronic materials and a set of theoretical tools to study them when charge-lattice interactions are important.

Title: Emergence of non-ergodic multifractal quantum states in geometrical fractals
Authors: Fabio Salvati, Mikhail I. Katsnelson, Andrey A. Bagrov
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality, a hallmark of non-interacting disordered metals which can potentially be observed in many-body localized states as well, is characterized by anomalous slow dynamics and appears relevant for many areas of quantum physics from measurement-driven systems to superconductivity. We propose a novel approach to achieve non-ergodic multifractal (NEM) states without disorder by iteratively introducing defects into a crystal lattice, reshaping it from a plain structure into fractal geometry. By comprehensive analysis of the Sierpiński gasket case, we find a robust evidence of the emergence of NEM states that go beyond the conventional classification of quantum states and designate new pathways for quantum transport studies. We discuss potential experimental signatures of these states.

Title: The Nonclassical Regime of the Two-dimensional Long-range XY Model: a Comprehensive Monte Carlo Study
Authors: Dingyun Yao, Tianning Xiao, Chao Zhang, Youjin Deng, Zhijie Fan
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) XY model plays a crucial role in statistical and condensed matter physics. With the introduction of long-range interactions, the system exhibits a richer set of physical phenomena and a crossover between non-classical and short-range universality this http URL this work, we investigate the 2D XY model with algebraically decaying interactions $\sim 1/r^{2+\sigma}$, and provide a comprehensive numerical analysis of its thermodynamic properties. We demonstrate that for $\sigma \leq 2$, the system undergoes a second-order phase transition into a ferromagnetic phase characterized by the emergence of long-range order. In the low-temperature phase, due to the presence of the Goldstone mode, the correlation function saturates to a non-zero constant in the form of a power law for $\sigma < 2$, with decaying exponent $2-\sigma$, and in the form of the inverse logarithm of distance for $\sigma=2$. Moreover, the critical points and exponents are also determined for various $\sigma$. We provide compelling evidence that the crossover between non-classical and short-range regimes occurs at $\sigma=2$. This work presents a detailed account of the simulation methodology, extensive numerical data, and new insights into the physics of long-range interacting systems.

Title: Disordered quantum antiferromagnetism in doped semiconductors: Density of states approach
Authors: N.A. Bogoslovskiy, P.V. Petrov, N.S. Averkiev
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the exchange interaction in a system of spatially disordered magnetic moments. A typical example of such a system is an impurity semiconductor, whose magnetic properties are associated with the exchange interaction of the impurity atoms. In this study, we consider the case of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, which we describe by the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. To calculate the magnetic properties of the disordered system, we employ the density of states method. Our calculations demonstrate a good quantitative agreement with the dependence of the Si:P magnetic susceptibility on temperature in a wide range of impurity concentrations and temperatures.

Title: Two-dimensional spin helix and magnon-induced singularity in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Yung-Yeh Chang, Kazuma Saito, Chen-Hsuan Hsu
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene exhibits prominent correlated phenomena in two distinct regimes: a Kondo lattice near the magic angle, resembling heavy fermion systems, and a triangular correlated domain wall network under interlayer bias, akin to sliding Luttinger liquids previously introduced for cuprates. Combining these characteristics, here we investigate a system where interacting electrons in the domain wall network couple to localized spins. Owing to inter-domain-wall correlations, a two-dimensional spin helix phase emerges as a result of spatial phase coherence across parallel domain walls. Within the spin helix phase, magnons can induce a singularity, reflected in the scaling exponents of various correlation functions, accessible through electrical means. We predict observable features in magnetic resonance and anisotropic paramagnetic spin susceptibility for the spin helix and the magnon-induced singularity, serving as experimental indicators of the interplay between the Kondo lattice and sliding Luttinger liquids. Integrating critical aspects of Luttinger liquid physics, magnetism, and Kondo physics in twisted bilayer graphene, our findings offer insights into similar correlated phenomena across a broad range of twisted van der Waals structures.

Title: Machine Learning-Driven Insights into Excitonic Effects in 2D Materials
Authors: Ahsan Javed, Sajid Ali
Abstract: Understanding excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) materials is critical for advancing their potential in next-generation electronic and photonic devices. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based framework to predict exciton binding energies in 2D materials, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional methods such as many-body perturbation theory (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Leveraging data from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections between cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic properties, significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with pronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression was employed to efficiently filter materials with largest exciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery process. Although developed for 2D systems, this approach is versatile and can be extended to three-dimensional materials, broadening its applicability in materials discovery.

Title: Inferring Higher-Order Couplings with Neural Networks
Authors: Aurélien Decelle, Alfonso de Jesús Navas Gómez, Beatriz Seoane
Abstract: Maximum entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical physics, are widely used to model pairwise interactions in complex systems across disciplines such as bioinformatics and neuroscience. While successful, these approaches often fail to capture higher-order interactions that are critical for understanding collective behavior. In contrast, modern machine learning methods can model such interactions, but their interpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations -- made tractable by the RBM's structure -- we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body interactions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact maps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling higher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.

Abstract: This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics -- though unavailable to them -- thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.

Title: Momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling in cuprates by RIXS: the roles of phonon symmetry and electronic structure

Abstract: The experimental determination of the magnitude and momentum dependence of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is an outstanding problem in condensed matter physics. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has been previously employed to determine the EPC, since the intensity of phonon peaks in RIXS spectra has been directly related to the underlying EPC strength. In order to assess the limits of validity of such a relation, we compare experimental results and theoretical predictions for several high-T$_c$ superconducting cuprates. Namely, we investigate the intensity of the bond-stretching phonon mode in CaCuO$_2$, La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, La$_{1.84}$Sr$_{0.16}$CuO$_4$ and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ along the high symmetry ($\zeta$,0), ($\zeta$,$\zeta$) directions and as a function of the azimuthal angle $\phi$ at fixed modulus of the in-plane momentum $\mathbf{q_\parallel}$. Using two different theoretical approaches for the description of the RIXS scattering from phonons, we find that the $\mathbf{q_\parallel}$-dependence of the RIXS intensity can be largely ascribed to the symmetry of the phonon mode, and that satisfactory prediction of the experimental results cannot be obtained without including realistic details of the electronic structure in the calculations. Regardless of the theoretical model, RIXS provides a reliable momentum dependence of EPC in cuprates and can be used to test advanced theoretical predictions.

Title: The effect of elastic-plastic mismatch and interface proximity on the fracture toughness of Ti-TiN thin films
Authors: Nidhin George Mathews, Aloshious Lambai, Marcus Hans, Jochen M. Schneider, Gaurav Mohanty, Balila Nagamani Jaya
Abstract: Magnetron sputtered titanium nitride (TiN) thin films are widely used as protective coatings due to their high hardness, but suffer from inherent brittleness and low fracture toughness, limiting their applicability. The multilayering of TiN films with metallic titanium (Ti) interlayers in the form of bi-layer and tri-layer systems have been studied using microcantilever fracture tests. Plastic dissipation in the Ti layer is shown to lead to an increase in crack growth resistance. The effect of the elastic-plastic mismatch between the two materials on the crack driving force, as well as the size of the fully developed plastic zone in Ti have been quantified in this work for the first time. It is shown that incorporating a Ti layer thickness of 250 nm can improve the fracture resistance by nearly ten times compared to the initiation fracture toughness in TiN, preventing catastrophic fracture of these multi-layered films. These results will aid in physics informed design of optimised thickness of metallic interlayers in multi-layered thin films.

Title: Single electron interference and capacitive edge mode coupling generates $Φ_0/2$ flux periodicity in Fabry-Perot interferometers
Authors: Shuang Liang, James Nakamura, Geoffrey C. Gardner, Michael J. Manfra
Abstract: Experimental observations of flux periodicity $\phi_{0}/2$, where $\phi_0=h/e$, for interference of the outermost edge mode in the integer quantum Hall regime have been attributed to an exotic electron pairing mechanism. We present measurements of an AlGaAs/GaAs Fabry-Perot interferometer operated in the integer quantum Hall regime for filling factors $1\leq \nu \leq 3$ that has been designed to simultaneously express measurable bulk-edge and edge-edge couplings. At integer fillings $\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$, we observe interference with flux periodicity $\phi_{0}/2$ for the outermost edge mode. Our analysis indicates that the periodicity $\phi_0/2$ is not driven by electron pairing but is the result of capacitive coupling between isolated edge modes and the interfering outer edge. The interfering unit of charge for the outermost edge mode at $\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$ was determined to be $e^*=1$, where the effective charge $e^*$ is normalized to the charge of an electron. Our measurements demonstrate that the magnitude of the interfering charge can be determined in operando in a Fabry-Perot interferometer.

Title: Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect
Authors: Kamran Behnia
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. Experimentally, the thermal Hall angle is maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. At this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions dominate over Umklapp and boundary scattering events. In the presence of a magnetic field, Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase, due to the difference in the spatial distributions of the positive charge of the nuclei and the negative charge of the electrons. Combined with unavoidable anharmonicity, the field-induced phase of the molecular wave-function gives rise to a geometric [Berry] phase for phonons and modifies three-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest displacement, $\delta u_m$, of phonons at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.

Title: Elastic Plateau-Rayleigh instability in soft cylinders: Surface elasticity and periodic beading
Authors: F. Magni, D. Riccobelli
Abstract: The Plateau-Rayleigh instability shows that a cylindrical fluid flow can be destabilized by surface tension. Similarly, capillary forces can make an elastic cylinder unstable when the elastocapillary length is comparable to the cylinder's radius. While existing models predict a single isolated bulge as the result of an instability, experiments reveal a periodic sequence of bulges spaced out by thinned regions, a phenomenon known as beading instability. Most models assume that surface tension is independent of the deformation of the solid, neglecting variations due to surface stretch. In this work, we assume that surface tension arises from the deformation of material particles near the free surface, treating it as a pre-stretched elastic surface surrounding the body. Using the theoretical framework proposed by Gurtin and Murdoch, we show that a cylindrical solid can undergo a mechanical instability with a finite critical wavelength if the body is sufficiently soft or axially stretched. Post-buckling numerical simulations reveal a morphology in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Period-halving secondary bifurcations are also observed. The results of this research have broad implications for soft materials, biomechanics, and microfabrication applications where surface tension plays a crucial role.

Title: Effective conductivity of conduit networks with random conductivities
Authors: I. Colecchio, E. Le Gall, B. Noetinger
Abstract: The effective conductivity ($T^{eff}$) of 2D and 3D Random Resistor Networks (RRNs) with random edge conductivity are studied. The combined influence of geometrical disorder, which controls the overall connectivity of the medium, and leads to percolation effects, and conductivity randomness is investigated. A formula incorporating connectivity aspects and second-order averaging methods, widely used in the stochastic hydrology community, is derived and extrapolated to higher orders using a power averaging formula based on a mean-field argument. This approach highlights the role of the so-called resistance distance, introduced by graph theorists. Simulations are performed on various RRN geometries constructed from 2D and 3D bond-percolation lattices. The results confirm the robustness of the power averaging technique and the relevance of the mean-field assumption.

Title: Dynamical probe of the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect in one-dimensional confined fermions
Authors: André Becker, Georgios M. Koutentakis, Peter Schmelcher
Abstract: We investigate the real-time dynamics of a quenched quantum impurity immersed in a one-dimensional ultracold Fermi gas, focusing on the breakdown of the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation due to non-adiabatic effects. Despite a sizable impurity-bath mass imbalance, increasing interactions induce strong non-adiabatic couplings, disrupting adiabatic motion and enabling population transfer between the adiabatic potential energy curves. These transitions are governed by conical intersections arising from the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect, dynamically shaping the impurity's motion through the bath. Using ab initio simulations via the Multi-Layer Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree method and a multi-channel Born-Oppenheimer framework, we track the impurity's evolution and directly prove the dynamical manifestation of the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect. We analyze two key scenarios: (i) a small initial shift, where a single avoided crossing drives transitions, and (ii) a large shift, where multiple avoided crossings lead to enhanced non-adiabaticity, self-trapping, and energy redistribution. Our findings establish ultracold fermionic few-body systems as tunable platforms for studying non-adiabatic quantum dynamics, opening new avenues for controlled impurity transport in strongly correlated environments.

Title: Solving the SU($N$) Orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model
Authors: Nico A. Hackner, Peizhi Mai, Philip W. Phillips
Abstract: We show that the physics of the SU($N$) Hubbard model can be realistically simulated with the recently developed orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. In this approach, the momentum mixing absent from the band Hatsugai-Kohmoto model is included by grouping $n$-Hubbard atoms into a cluster. We take advantage of the rapid convergence of this scheme ($1/n^2$) and show that for $n\approx O(10)$, quantitative agreement with the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo method arises for the double occupancy as well as qualitative agreement for the filling and compressibility across the Mott transition. Additional features of this work are that we can obtain low-temperature physics, which could be qualitatively different from its high-temperature counterpart, and dynamical quantities without resorting to analytical continuation, thereby establishing the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model as a useful alternative perspective for studying strong correlations in SU($N$) systems.

Title: Efficient Crystal Structure Prediction Using Genetic Algorithm and Universal Neural Network Potential
Authors: Takuya Shibayama, Hideaki Imamura, Katsuhiko Nishimra, Kohei Shinohara, Chikashi Shinagawa, So Takamoto, Ju Li
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is crucial for identifying stable crystal structures in given systems and is a prerequisite for computational atomistic simulations. Recent advances in neural network potentials (NNPs) have reduced the computational cost of CSP. However, searching for stable crystal structures across the entire composition space in multicomponent systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose a novel genetic algorithm (GA) -based CSP method using a universal NNP. Our GA-based methods are designed to efficiently expand convex hull volumes while preserving the diversity of crystal structures. This approach draws inspiration from the similarity between convex hull updates and Pareto front evolution in multi-objective optimization. Our evaluation shows that the present method outperforms the symmetry-aware random structure generation, achieving a larger convex hull with fewer trials. We demonstrated that our approach, combined with the developed universal NNP (PFP), can accurately reproduce and explore phase diagrams obtained through DFT calculations; this indicates the validity of PFP across a wide range of crystal structures and element combinations. This study, which integrates a universal NNP with a GA-based CSP method, highlights the promise of these methods in materials discovery.

Title: Quantum Resistor-Capacitor Circuit with two Majorana Bound States
Authors: Cong Li, Bing Dong
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the equations of motion for a system composed of a spinless quantum dot coupled to two normal leads and two Majorana bound states (MBSs), utilizing the auxiliary-mode expansion method and the nonequilibrium Green function technique. Subsequently, we use these equations to analyze the linear conductance, adiabatic linear capacitance, and adiabatic linear relaxation resistance of the system. We find that when the phase difference between the two MBSs is an integer multiple of $\pi$, the MBSs enter the zero mode, leading to the complete suppression of the linear relaxation resistance. In this case, the relaxation resistance is highly sensitive to the MBSs modes. On the other hand, when the phase difference is not an integer multiple of $\pi$, the linear conductance is fully suppressed. Furthermore, the linear relaxation resistance remains completely suppressed, even when the MBSs are not in the zero mode, and the system loses its sensitivity to the MBSs modes.

Title: A comparative review of recent results on supercritical anomalies in two-dimensional kinetic Ising and Blume-Capel ferromagnets
Authors: Gloria M. Buendía, Celeste Mendes, Per Arne Rikvold
Abstract: Following the unexpected experimental discovery of ``sideband'' peaks in the fluctuation spectrum of thin Co films driven by a slowly oscillating magnetic field with a constant bias [P.~Riego et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 117202 (2017)] numerical studies of two-state Ising and three-state Blume-Capel (BC) ferromagnets in this dynamically supercritical regime have flourished and been successful in explaining this phenomenon. Here, we give a comparative review of this new literature and its connections to earlier work. Following an introduction and a presentation of the two models and the computational method used in many of these studies, we present numerical results for both models. Particular attention is paid to the fact that zero spins in the BC model tend to collect at he interfaces between regions of the two nonzero spin values, +/-1. We present strong arguments that this phenomenon leads to a reduction of the effective interface tension in the BC model, compared to the Ising model.

Title: Learning rate matrix and information-thermodynamic trade-off relation
Authors: Kenshin Matsumoto, Shin-ichi Sasa, Andreas Dechant
Abstract: Non-equilibrium systems exchange information in addition to energy. In information thermodynamics, the information flow is characterized by the learning rate, which is not invariant under coordinate transformations. To formalize the property of the learning rate under variable transformations, we introduce a learning rate matrix. This matrix has the learning rates as its diagonal elements and characterizes the changes in the learning rates under linear coordinate transformations. The maximal eigenvalue of the symmetric part of the learning rate matrix gives the maximal information flow under orthogonal transformations. Furthermore, we derive a new trade-off relation between the learning rate and the heat dissipation of a subsystem. Finally, we illustrate the results using analytically solvable yet experimentally feasible models.

Title: Agentic Information Theory: Ergodicity and Intrinsic Semantics of Information Processes
Authors: James P. Crutchfield, Alexandra Jurgens
Abstract: We develop information theory for the temporal behavior of memoryful agents moving through complex -- structured, stochastic -- environments. We introduce information processes -- stochastic processes produced by cognitive agents in real-time as they interact with and interpret incoming stimuli. We provide basic results on the ergodicity and semantics of the resulting time series of Shannon information measures that monitor an agent's adapting view of uncertainty and structural correlation in its environment.

Title: In-depth Investigation of Conduction Mechanism on Defect-induced Proton-conducting Electrolytes BaHfO$_3$
Authors: Peng Feng, Hang Ma, Kuan Yang, Yingjie Lv, Ying Liang, Tianxing Ma, Jiajun Linghu, Zhi-Peng Li
Abstract: This study utilizes first-principles computational methods to comprehensively analyze the impact of A-site doping on the proton conduction properties of BaHfO$_3$. The goal is to offer theoretical support for the advancement of electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells. Our research has uncovered that BaHfO$_3$ demonstrates promising potential for proton conduction, with a low proton migration barrier of $0.28$ eV, suggesting efficient proton conduction can be achieved at lower temperatures. Through A-site doping, particularly with low-valence-state ions and the introduction of Ba vacancies, we can effectively decrease the formation energy of oxygen vacancies (\( E_{\text{vac}} \)), leading to an increase in proton concentration. Additionally, our study reveals that the primary mechanism for proton migration in BaHfO$_3$ is the Grotthuss mechanism rather than the vehicle mechanism. Examination of the changes in lattice parameters during proton migration indicates that while doping or vacancy control strategies do not alter the mode of H$^+$ migration, they do influence the migration pathway and barrier. These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the proton conduction properties of BaHfO$_3$ through A-site doping and lay a solid theoretical foundation for the development of novel, highly efficient solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte materials.

Title: A 2D-CFT Factory: Critical Lattice Models from Competing Anyon Condensation Processes in SymTO/SymTFT
Authors: Ling-Yan Hung, Kaixin Ji, Ce Shen, Yidun Wan, Yu Zhao
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a ``CFT factory'' : a novel algorithm of methodically generating 2D lattice models that would flow to 2D conformal fixed points in the infrared. These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.

Title: Neuralized Fermionic Tensor Networks for Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Si-Jing Du, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: We describe a class of neuralized fermionic tensor network states (NN-fTNS) that introduce non-linearity into fermionic tensor networks through configuration-dependent neural network transformations of the local tensors. The construction uses the fTNS algebra to implement a natural fermionic sign structure and is compatible with standard tensor network algorithms, but gains enhanced expressivity through the neural network parametrization. Using the 1D and 2D Fermi-Hubbard models as benchmarks, we demonstrate that NN-fTNS achieve order of magnitude improvements in the ground-state energy compared to pure fTNS with the same bond dimension, and can be systematically improved through both the tensor network bond dimension and the neural network parametrization. Compared to existing fermionic neural quantum states (NQS) based on Slater determinants and Pfaffians, NN-fTNS offer a physically motivated alternative fermionic structure. Furthermore, compared to such states, NN-fTNS naturally exhibit improved computational scaling and we demonstrate a construction that achieves linear scaling with the lattice size.

Title: Antichiral edge states and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in a two-dimensional proximity-induced superconductor
Authors: Gabriel F. Rodríguez Ruiz, Juan Herrera Mateos, Leandro Tosi, Christoph Strunk, Carlos Balseiro, Liliana Arrachea
Abstract: We show that a magnetic field parallel to the plane of a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin orbit coupling in proximity to a superconductor leads to a topological phase in coexistence with a single pair of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. This phase hosts antichiral edge states of co-propagating Majorana fermions and are spatially localized at the opposite edges of the sample, perpendicular to the magnetic field. We discuss the characteristic signatures in the current-phase relation of a Josephson junction formed by two reservoirs in the topological phase.

Title: Two dimensional sub-wavelength topological dark state lattices
Authors: Domantas Burba, Gediminas Juzeliūnas
Abstract: We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.

Title: Interfacial instability of confined 3D active droplets
Authors: Bennett C. Sessa, Federico Cao, Robert A. Pelcovits, Thomas R. Powers, Guillaume Duclos
Abstract: Instabilities of fluid-fluid interfaces are ubiquitous in passive soft matter. Adding activity to the interface or either fluid can dramatically change the stability of the interface. Using experiment and theory, we investigate the interfacial instability of a deformable 3D active nematic liquid crystal droplet in the isotropic phase surrounded by a passive fluid and confined between two parallel plates. Spontaneous active flows drive the growth of undulations along the active/passive interface, with the mode number of the fastest-growing mode increasing with droplet radius and decreasing with gap height. We apply the lubrication approximation to a minimal nematohydrodynamic model to determine the growth rates of all interfacial modes. The magnitude of the growth rate is determined by the active timescale and the relaxation timescales associated with liquid crystalline order, as well as capillary and viscous stresses. We find multiple points of agreement between experiment and theory, including the shape evolution of individual droplets, the growth rates of unstable modes averaged across many droplets, and the extensional shear flows observed within droplets.

Title: Field-Free Superconducting Diode Enabled by Geometric Asymmetry and Perpendicular Magnetization
Authors: Jiaxu Li, Zijian Zhang, Shiqi Wang, Yu He, Haochang Lyu, Qiusha Wang, Bowen Dong, Daoqian Zhu, Hisakazu Matsuki, Dapeng Zhu, Guang Yang, Weisheng Zhao
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE)- manifested as directional, dissipationless supercurrents - is pivotal for realizing energy-efficient superconducting logic and memory technologies. Achieving high-efficiency SDE without external magnetic fields, however, remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report a strongly enhanced, field-free SDE in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures, enabled by the interplay of engineered geometric asymmetry and stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. This configuration promotes directional vortex entry and spatially selective pinning, yielding diode efficiencies that exceed all previously reported field-free values. Temperature- and field-dependent transport measurements, supported by micromagnetic simulations, reveal that the enhanced nonreciprocity stems from three cooperative mechanisms: asymmetric vortex entry, localized magnetic pinning, and Lorentz-force imbalance. These findings establish a scalable, CMOS-compatible platform for high-performance superconducting rectifiers, offering new opportunities for cryogenic spintronics and quantum electronics.

Title: Hamilton-Jacobi equations from mean-field spin glasses
Authors: Hong-Bin Chen, Jiaming Xia
Abstract: We give a meaning to the Hamilton--Jacobi equation arising from mean-field spin glass models in the viscosity sense, and establish the corresponding well-posedness. Originally defined on the set of monotone probability measures, these equations can be interpreted, via an isometry, to be defined on an infinite-dimensional closed convex cone with an empty interior in a Hilbert space. We prove the comparison principle, and the convergence of finite-dimensional approximations furnishing the existence of solutions. Under additional convexity conditions, we show that the solution can be represented by a version of the Hopf--Lax formula, or the Hopf formula on cones. Previously, two notions of solutions were considered, one defined directly as the Hopf--Lax formula, and another as limits of finite-dimensional approximations. They have been proven to describe the limit free energy in a wide class of mean-field spin glass models. This work shows that these two kinds of solutions are viscosity solutions.

Title: Exceeding the maximum classical energy density in fully charged quantum batteries
Authors: Masahiro Hotta, Kazuki Ikeda
Abstract: Quantum batteries are anticipated to achieve significant advancements in energy storage capacity. In classical batteries, the energy density at each subsystem reaches its maximum value, denoted as $E_C$, which is determined by dividing the maximum energy by the number of subsystems. We demonstrate that this limit can be surpassed in quantum batteries by protocols of Quantum Energy Teleportaion (QET), allowing for the energy density at a subsystem to exceed the value of $E_C$. Our protocol offers enhanced efficiency, reduces experimental complexity on quantum computers, and enables instantaneous energy charging through Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). Leveraging quantum entanglement, this protocol significantly improves quantum energy storage systems, promising advances in quantum computing and new technological applications. This work represents a crucial step towards revolutionizing quantum energy storage and transfer.

Title: Dynamical quantum phase transition and thermal equilibrium in the lattice Thirring model
Authors: Mari Carmen Bañuls, Krzysztof Cichy, Hao-Ti Hung, Ying-Jer Kao, C.-J. David Lin, Amit Singh
Abstract: Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time evolution of the lattice Thirring model quenched out of equilibrium in both the critical and massive phases and study the appearance of dynamical quantum phase transitions, as nonanalyticities in the Loschmidt rate. Although the presence of a dynamical quantum phase transition in the model does not correspond to quenches across the critical line of the equilibrium phase diagram at zero temperature, we identify a threshold in the energy density of the initial state, necessary for a dynamical quantum phase transition to be present. Moreover, in the case of the gapped quench Hamiltonian, we unveil a connection of this threshold to a transition between different regions in the finite-temperature phase diagram.

Title: Chiral Nonlinear Polaritonics with van der Waals Metasurfaces

Abstract: In the strong-coupling regime, the interaction between light and matter reaches a hybridization state where the photonic and material components are inseparably linked. Using tailored states of light to break symmetries in such systems can facilitate the development of novel non-equilibrium quantum materials. Chiral optical cavities offer a promising approach for this, enabling either temporal or spatial symmetry-breaking, both of which are unachievable with conventional mirror cavities. For spatial symmetry-breaking, a cavity must discriminate the handedness of circularly polarized light, a functionality uniquely provided by chiral metamaterials. Here, we propose and demonstrate experimentally a chiral transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) metasurface with broken out-of-plane symmetry, allowing for the selective formation of self-hybridized exciton-polaritons with specific handedness. Our metasurface maintains maximal chirality for oblique incidence up to 20°, significantly outperforming all previously known designs, thereby transforming the angle of incidence from a constraint into a new degree of freedom for sub-nanometer-precise tuning of the cavity's resonant wavelength. Moreover, we study the chiral strong-coupling regime in nonlinear experiments and reveal the polariton-driven nature of chiral third-harmonic generation. Our results demonstrate a clear pathway towards van der Waals (vdW) metasurfaces as a novel and potent platform for chiral polaritonics with implications in a wide range of photonics research, such as non-reciprocal photonic devices and valleytronics.

Title: Holographic deep thermalization for secure and efficient quantum random state generation
Authors: Bingzhi Zhang, Peng Xu, Xiaohui Chen, Quntao Zhuang
Abstract: Randomness is a cornerstone of science, underpinning fields such as statistics, information theory, dynamical systems, and thermodynamics. In quantum science, quantum randomness, especially random pure states, plays a pivotal role in fundamental questions like black hole physics and quantum complexity, as well as in practical applications such as quantum device benchmarking and quantum advantage certification. The conventional approach for generating genuine random states, called `deep thermalization', faces significant challenges, including scalability issues due to the need for a large ancilla system and susceptibility to attacks, as demonstrated in this work. We introduce holographic deep thermalization, a secure and hardware-efficient quantum random state generator. By adopting a sequential application of a scrambling-measure-reset process, it continuously trades space with time, and substantially reduces the required ancilla size to as small as a system-size independent constant; At the same time, it guarantees security by removing quantum correlation between the data system and attackers. Thanks to the resource reduction, our circuit-based implementation on IBM Quantum devices achieves genuine $5$-qubit random state generation utilizing only a total of $8$ qubits.

Title: Intrinsic Quantum Mpemba Effect in Markovian Systems and Quantum Circuits
Authors: Dongheng Qian, Huan Wang, Jing Wang
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) describes the counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system farther from equilibrium reaches steady state faster than one closer to equilibrium. However, ambiguity in defining a suitable distance measure between quantum states has led to varied interpretations across different contexts. Here we propose the intrinsic quantum Mpemba effect (IQME), defined using the trajectory length traced by the quantum state as a more appropriate measure of distance--distinct from previous trajectory-independent metrics. By treating quantum states as points in a Riemannian space defined by statistical distance, the trajectory length emerges as a more natural and accurate characterization of the counterintuitive dynamics, drawing an analogy to the classical Brachistochrone problem. We demonstrate the existence of IQME in Markovian systems and extend its definition to quantum circuits, thereby establishing a unified framework applicable to both open and closed systems. Notably, we observe an IQME in a $U(1)$-symmetric circuit, offering new insights into the rates of quantum thermalization for different initial states. This work deepens our understanding of quantum state evolution and lays the foundation for accurately capturing novel quantum dynamical behaviour.

Title: First-Passage Approach to Optimizing Perturbations for Improved Training of Machine Learning Models
Authors: Sagi Meir, Tommer D. Keidar, Shlomi Reuveni, Barak Hirshberg
Abstract: Machine learning models have become indispensable tools in applications across the physical sciences. Their training is often time-consuming, vastly exceeding the inference timescales. Several protocols have been developed to perturb the learning process and improve the training, such as shrink and perturb, warm restarts, and stochastic resetting. For classifiers, these perturbations have been shown to result in enhanced speedups or improved generalization. However, the design of such perturbations is usually done ad hoc by intuition and trial and error. To rationally optimize training protocols, we frame them as first-passage processes and consider their response to perturbations. We show that if the unperturbed learning process reaches a quasi-steady state, the response at a single perturbation frequency can predict the behavior at a wide range of frequencies. We employ this approach to a CIFAR-10 classifier using the ResNet-18 model and identify a useful perturbation and frequency among several possibilities. We demonstrate the transferability of the approach to other datasets, architectures, optimizers and even tasks (regression instead of classification). Our work allows optimization of perturbations for improving the training of machine learning models using a first-passage approach.

Title: Strong coupling between a dielectric nanocavity and a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide
Authors: F. Schröder, P. Wyborski, M. Xiong, G. Kountouris, B. Munkhbat, M. Wubs, P. T. Kristensen, J. Mørk, N. Stenger
Abstract: We demonstrate strong coupling between light in a dielectric nanocavity with deep sub-wavelength confinement and excitons in a monolayer of molybdenum ditelluride. Avoided crossing is demonstrated by both photoluminescence and reflection measurements, from which we extract a light-matter interaction strength of $g_{\mathrm{PL}} =\SI{5.3\pm0.3}{\milli\eV}$ and $g_{\mathrm{R}} =\SI{4.7\pm0.7}{\milli\eV}$, respectively. The associated Rabi splitting is twice as large as the system's losses. These values are in good agreement with values obtained by a novel exciton reaction coordinate formalism, yielding $g_{\mathrm{theory}} = \SI{5.2\pm0.7}{\milli\eV}$. The strong light-matter interaction, combined with low losses and sub-wavelength confinement of light, black demonstrates a new regime of light-matter interactions where strong nonlinearities at the single-photon level are expected.

Title: Comparative study of divacancies in 3C-, 4H- and 6H-SiC
Authors: Danial Shafizade, Joel Davidsson, Takeshi Ohshima, Nguyen Tien Son, Ivan G. Ivanov
Abstract: The divacancy comprising two neighboring vacant sites in the SiC lattice is a promising defect for applications in quantum technology. So far, most work is concerned with the divacancy in 4H-SiC, whereas the divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC have received much less attention. Here, we outline arguments showing that the neutral charge state of the divacancies in the latter two polytypes is intrinsically stable, in contrast to that in 4H-SiC where the photoluminescence quenches in most materials for certain excitation energies (below approximately 1.3 eV). Divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC are anticipated to remain stable even with resonant excitation. We provide new ab initio calculation results for the charge transfer levels of divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC. Using the temperature dependence of the divacancy emission in 3C-SiC, we estimate the energy position of the (+|0) charge transfer level of the divacancy within the bandgap of this polytype and compare with theoretical results.

Title: Optimizing two-qubit gates for ultracold atoms using Fermi-Hubbard models
Authors: Juhi Singh, Jan A. P. Reuter, Tommaso Calarco, Felix Motzoi, Robert Zeier
Abstract: Ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices have emerged as a scalable and promising platform for quantum simulation and computation. However, gate speeds remain a significant limitation for practical applications. In this work, we employ quantum optimal control to design fast, collision-based two-qubit gates within a superlattice based on a Fermi-Hubbard description, reaching errors in the range of $10^{-3}$ for realistic parameters. Numerically optimizing the lattice depths and the scattering length, we effectively manipulate hopping and interaction strengths intrinsic to the Fermi-Hubbard model. Our results provide five times shorter gate durations by allowing for higher energy bands in the optimization, suggesting that standard modeling with a two-band Fermi-Hubbard model is insufficient for describing the dynamics of fast gates and we find that four to six bands are required. Additionally, we achieve non-adiabatic gates by employing time-dependent lattice depths rather than using only fixed depths. The optimized control pulses not only maintain high efficacy in the presence of laser intensity and phase noise but also result in negligible inter-well couplings.

Title: No-go theorem for environment-assisted invariance in non-unitary dynamics
Authors: Akira Sone, Akram Touil, Kenji Maeda, Paola Cappellaro, Sebastian Deffner
Abstract: We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that this also holds for the multipartite scenario. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we show that the static condition of the eternal black hole in AdS/CFT is violated when the CFTs are coupled to the external baths.

Title: Large $N$ Wess-Zumino model at finite temperature and large chemical potential in $3d$
Authors: Srijan Kumar
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.

Title: Operator growth in many-body systems of higher spins
Authors: Igor Ermakov
Abstract: We study operator growth in many-body systems with on-site spins larger than $1/2$, considering both non-integrable and integrable regimes. Specifically, we compute Lanczos coefficients in the one- and two-dimensional Ising models for spin values $S=1/2$, $1$, and $3/2$, and observe asymptotically linear growth $b_n \sim n$. On the integrable side, we investigate the Potts model and find square-root growth $b_n \sim \sqrt{n}$. Both results are consistent with the predictions of the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. To analyze operator dynamics in this setting, we employ a generalized operator basis constructed from tensor products of shift and clock operators, extending the concept of Pauli strings to higher local dimensions. We further report that the recently introduced formalism of equivalence classes of Pauli strings can be naturally extended to this setting. This formalism enables the study of simulable Heisenberg dynamics by identifying dynamically isolated operator subspaces of moderate dimensionality. As an example, we introduce the Kitaev-Potts model with spin-$1$, where the identification of such a subspace allows for exact time evolution at a computational cost lower than that of exact diagonalization.

Title: Competing Bosonic Reactions: Insight from Exactly Solvable Time-Dependent Models
Authors: Fumika Suzuki, Rajesh K. Malla, Nikolai A. Sinitsyn
Abstract: We discuss the progress on exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models from a perspective of their application to competing reactions of particle creation from a false vacuum. Such models generally predict that, even with identical initial conditions, and for nearly the same other particle parameters, a quantum coherent evolution results in a final particle distribution with significant asymmetry. We use an exact solution of the driven bosonic Tavis-Cummings model for two reaction pathways in order to quantify this effect, reveal a corresponding phase transition, and identify its universality class.

Title: Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method
Authors: Raffaele Salioni, Rocco Martinazzo, Davide Emilio Galli, Christian Apostoli
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ansätze.

Title: Schwinger-Keldysh approach to tunneling transport at a hadron-quark interface
Authors: Tingyu Zhang, Hiroyuki Tajima, Motoi Tachibana
Abstract: We theoretically discuss quantum tunneling transport and frictions at a hadron-quark matter interface based on the Schwinger-Keldysh approach combined with the tunneling Hamiltonian, which has been developed in the context of condensed matter physics. In the inner core of massive neutron stars, it is expected that cold quark matter appears at sufficiently high densities and hence exhibits color superconductivity, surrounded by nucleon superfluids at lower densities. The perturbative expressions of the tunneling current and the friction at the interface are obtained in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions. We demonstrate the DC Josephson current that occurs at the hadron-quark superfluid interface in the present scheme. Our framework can be applied to various conflagrations involving the interfaces relevant to astrophysical phenomena.

Title: Ion Track Formation via Electric-Field-Enhanced Nanoscale Energy Deposition
Authors: Zikang Ge, Jinhao Hu, Shengyuan Peng, Wei Kang, Xiaofei Shen, Yanbo Xie, Jianming Xue
Abstract: High-energy ion irradiation deposits extreme energy in a narrow range (1-10 nm) along ion trajectories in solid through electronic energy loss, producing unique irradiation effects such as ion tracks. However, intrinsic velocity effects impose an upper limit on electronic energy loss that cannot be overcome by adjusting irradiation parameters. We introduce a method using electric fields during irradiation to enhance nanoscale energy deposition by accelerating ion-excited electrons within sub-picosecond this http URL extended thermal spike model quantitatively describes this enhancement and predicts a significant reduction in the electronic energy loss required for ion track formation in amorphous SiO2, which is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. This work provides a new approach to control energy deposition during irradiation and boosts the wide application of ion tracks in material modification and nanoengineering to much broader extents.
