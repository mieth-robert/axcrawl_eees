Title: Electron Transport in One-Dimensional Disordered Lattice
Authors: V. Slavin, Y. Savin, M. Klimov, M. Kiyashko
Abstract: We have studied the peculiarities of electron transport in one-dimensional (1D) disordered chain at the presence of correlations between on-site interaction and tunneling integrals. In the considered models the disorder in host-lattice sites positions is caused by presence of defects, impurities, existence of electron-phonon interaction, e.t.c. It is shown, that for certain combination of parameters the localization of electron state, inherited by a various of 1D disordered systems, disappear and electron transport becomes possible. The parameters of this transport are established.

Title: An anomalous particle-exchange mechanism for two isolated Bose gases merged into one
Authors: Q. H. Liu
Abstract: In an isolated ideal Bose system with a fixed energy, the number of microstates depends solely on the configurations of bosons in excited states, implying zero entropy for particles in the ground state. When two such systems merge, the resulting entropy is less than the sum of the individual entropies. This entropy decrease is numerically shown to arise from an effectively but anomalous exchange of particles in excited states, where $\overline{N}!/(\overline{N}_{1}!\overline{N}_{2}!)<1$. Here, $\overline{N}$, $\overline{N}_{1}$, and $\overline{N}_{2}$ are real decimals representing, respectively, the mean number of particles in excited states in the merged system and the two individual systems before merging, with $\overline{N}<\overline{N}_{1}+\overline{N}_{2}$.

Title: Scalable Bayesian Optimization for High-Dimensional Coarse-Grained Model Parameterization
Authors: Carlos A. Martins Junior, Daniela A. Damasceno, Keat Yung Hue, Caetano R. Miranda, Erich A. Müller, Rodrigo A. Vargas-Hernández
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) force field models are extensively utilised in material simulations due to their scalability. Traditionally, these models are parameterized using hybrid strategies that integrate top-down and bottom-up approaches; however, this combination restricts the capacity to jointly optimize all parameters. While Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been explored as an alternative search strategy for identifying optimal parameters, its application has traditionally been limited to low-dimensional problems. This has contributed to the perception that BO is unsuitable for more realistic CG models, which often involve a large number of parameters. In this study, we challenge this assumption by successfully extending BO to optimize a high-dimensional CG model. Specifically, we show that a 41-parameter CG model of Pebax-1657, a copolymer composed of alternating polyamide and polyether segments, can be effectively parameterized using BO, resulting in a model that accurately reproduces key physical properties of its atomistic counterpart. Our optimization framework simultaneously targets density, radius of gyration, and glass transition temperature. It achieves convergence in fewer than 600 iterations, resulting in a CG model that shows consistent improvements across all three properties.

Title: Wafer-scale Synthesis of Mithrene and its Application in 2D Heterostructure UV Photodetectors
Authors: Maryam Mohammadi, Stefanie L. Stoll, Analía F. Herrero, Sana Khan, Federico Fabrizi, Christian Gollwitzer, Zhenxing Wang, Surendra B. Anantharaman, Max C. Lemme
Abstract: Silver phenylselenide (AgSePh), known as mithrene, is a two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic chalcogenide (MOC) semiconductor with a wide direct band gap, narrow blue emission and in-plane anisotropy. However, its application in next-generation optoelectronics is limited by crystal size and orientation, as well as challenges in large-area growth. Here, we introduce a controlled tarnishing step on the silver surface prior to the solid-vapor-phase chemical transformation into AgSePh thin films. Mithrene thin films were prepared through thermally assisted conversion (TAC) at 100°C, incorporating a pre-tarnishing water (H${_2}$O) vapor pulse and propylamine (PrNH${_2}$) as a coordinating ligand to modulate Ag${^+}$ ion reactivity and facilitate the conversion of Ph${_2}$Se${_2}$ into an active intermediate. The AgSePh thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The pre-tarnishing process, combined with organic ligands, resulted in large crystals exceeding 1 ${\mu}$m and improved homogeneous in-plane orientation, while also enabling the selective, wafer-scale synthesis of mithrene on 100 mm wafers. Furthermore, the films were integrated on planar graphene field-effect phototransistors (GFETs) and demonstrated photoresponsivity beyond 100 A/W at 450 nm, highlighting mithrene's potential for blue light-detection applications.

Title: Conformal scalar field theory from Ising tricriticality on the fuzzy sphere
Authors: Joseph Taylor, Cristian Voinea, Zlatko Papić, Ruihua Fan
Abstract: Free theories are landmarks in the landscape of quantum field theories: their exact solvability serves as a pillar for perturbative constructions of interacting theories. Fuzzy sphere regularization, which combines quantum Hall physics with state-operator correspondence, has recently been proposed as a promising framework for simulating three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), but so far it has not provided access to free theories. We overcome this limitation by designing a bilayer quantum Hall system that hosts an Ising tricritical point -- a nontrivial fixed point where first-order and second-order transitions meet -- which flows to the conformally coupled scalar theory in the infrared. The critical energy spectrum and operator structure match those at the Gaussian fixed point, providing nonperturbative evidence for the emergence of a free scalar CFT. Our results expand the landscape of CFTs realizable on the fuzzy sphere and demonstrate that even free bosonic theories -- previously inaccessible -- can emerge from interacting electrons in this framework.

Title: An Algebraic Theory of Gapped Domain Wall Partons
Authors: Matthew Buican, Roman Geiko, Milo Moses, Bowen Shi
Abstract: The entanglement bootstrap program has generated new quantum numbers associated with degrees of freedom living on gapped domain walls between topological phases in two dimensions. Most fundamental among these are the so-called "parton" quantum numbers, which give rise to a zoo of composite sectors. In this note, we propose a categorical description of partons. Along the way, we make contact with ideas from generalized symmetries and SymTFT.

Title: Characterization of WSe$_2$ films using reflection Kikuchi diffraction in the scanning electron microscope and multivariate statistical analyses
Authors: Tianbi Zhang, Jakub Holzer, Tomáš Vystavěl, Miroslav Kolíbal, Estácio Paiva de Araújo, Chris Stephens, T. Ben Britton
Abstract: The study of thin films and 2D materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides such as WSe$_2$ offers opportunities to leverage their properties in advanced sensors, quantum technologies, and device to optimize functional performance. In this work, we characterize thin WSe$_2$ samples with variable thicknesses using scanning electron microscope (SEM)-based techniques focused on analysis of backscattered electron signal and Kikuchi diffraction patterns. These data were collected via a pixelated electron-counting direct electron detector positioned below the pole piece primarily configured for reflection Kikuchi diffraction (RKD), and a similar detector placed in the more conventional electron backscatter diffraction geometry. In addition to conventional pattern analysis for orientation microscopy, multivariate statistical methods (MSA) based on principal component analysis were applied to analyze diffraction patterns and differentiate thickness variations and crystal orientations within the thin films through data clustering. These results were compared with atomic force microscopy to validate thickness measurements. Our findings indicate that RKD combined with MSA is highly effective for characterizing 2D materials, enabling simultaneous assessment of thickness and crystallographic orientation. Systematic acceleration voltage variations in RKD experiments and comparisons with EBSD data suggest that the thickness dependency arises from inelastic scattering of diffracted electrons, which affects pattern contrast in the thin film regime. Collection and analysis of patterns obtained from monolayer, bilayer and tri-layer of WSe$_2$ are also demonstrated. This work reinforces the utility of SEM-based techniques, such as RKD, as valuable tools for the materials characterization toolkit, particularly for thin films and 2D materials.

Title: Magnetic dilution in the triangular lattice antiferromagnet NaYb$_{1-x}$Lu$_{x}$O$_2$
Authors: Steven J. Gomez Alvarado, Brenden R. Ortiz, Soren Bear, Benito A. Gonzalez, Andrea N. Capa Salinas, Adam Berlie, Michael J. Graf, Stephen D. Wilson
Abstract: The delafossite-like compound NaYbO$_2$ hosts a triangular lattice of Yb$^{3+}$ moments and is a promising candidate for realizing a quantum spin liquid state. Here we leverage the substitution of nonmagnetic Lu$^{3+}$ onto the Yb$^{3+}$ sites to track the evolution of the quantum disordered ground state with increasing magnetic disorder in NaYb$_{1-x}$Lu$_x$O$_2$. Low temperature $\mu$SR measurements preclude conventional spin freezing and magnetic inhomogeneity, and instead resolve resilient, correlated magnetic fluctuations that persist to at least 15$\%$ dilution. Heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility measurements resolve a rapid suppression of the field-induced ``up-up-down" phase upon introducing magnetic disorder and a crossover in the power-law behavior of the low-temperature magnetic excitations associated with the zero-field quantum disordered ground state. Our combined results place constraints on theories modeling the emergence of the quantum spin liquid-like behavior in NaYbO$_2$.

Title: Accelerated discovery and design of Fe-Co-Zr magnets with tunable magnetic anisotropy through machine learning and parallel computing
Authors: Weiyi Xia, Maxim Moraru, Ying Wai Li, Timothy Liao, James R. Chelikowsky, Cai-Zhuang Wang
Abstract: Rare earth (RE)-free permanent magnets, as alternative substitutes for RE-containing magnets for sustainable energy technologies and modern electronics, have attracted considerable interest. We performed a comprehensive search for new hard magnetic materials in the ternary Fe-Co-Zr space by leveraging a scalable, machine learning-assisted materials discovery framework running on GPU-enabled exascale computing resources. This framework integrates crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) machine learning (ML) method with first-principles calculations to efficiently navigate the vast composition-structure space. The efficiency and accuracy of the ML approach enable us to reveal 9 new thermodynamically stable ternary Fe-Co-Zr compounds and 81 promising low-energy metastable phases with their formation energies within 0.1 eV/atom above the convex hull. The predicted compounds span a wide range of crystal symmetries and magnetic behaviors, providing a rich platform for tuning functional properties. Based on the analysis of site-specific magnetic properties, we show that the Fe6Co17Zr6 compound obtained from our ML discovery can be further optimized by chemical doping. Chemical substitutions lead to a ternary Fe5Co18Zr6 phase with a strong anisotropy of K1 = 1.1 MJ/m3, and a stable quaternary magnetic Fe5Co16Zr6Mn4 compound.

Title: Susceptibility for extremely low external fluctuations and critical behaviour of Greenberg-Hastings neuronal model
Authors: Joaquin Almeira, Daniel A. Martin, Dante R. Chialvo, Sergio A. Cannas
Abstract: We consider the scaling behaviour of the fluctuation susceptibility associated with the average activation in the Greenberg-Hastings neural network model and its relation to microscopic spontaneous activation. We found that, as the spontaneous activation probability tends to zero, a clear finite size scaling behaviour in the susceptibility emerges, characterized by critical exponents which follow already known scaling laws. This shows that the spontaneous activation probability plays the role of an external field conjugated to the order parameter of the dynamical activation transition. The roles of different kinds of activation mechanisms around the different dynamical phase transitions exhibited by the model are characterized numerically and using a mean field approximation.

Title: Hyperuniformity in ternary fluid mixtures: the role of wetting and hydrodynamics
Authors: Nadia Bihari Padhan, Axel Voigt
Abstract: Phase separation in multicomponent fluids is central to understanding the organization of complex materials and biological structures. The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations offer a robust framework for modeling such systems, capturing both diffusive dynamics and hydrodynamic interactions. In this work, we investigate hyperuniformity, characterized by suppressed large-scale density fluctuations, in ternary fluid mixtures governed by the ternary CHNS equations. Using large-scale direct numerical simulations, we systematically explore the influence of wetting conditions and hydrodynamic effects on emergent hyperuniformity. Similar to binary systems we observe that the presence of hydrodynamics weakens the hyperuniform characteristics. However, also the wetting properties have an effect. We find that in partial wetting regimes, all three components exhibit comparable degrees of hyperuniformity. In contrast, for complete wetting scenarios, where one component preferentially wets the other two, the wetting component displays a significant reduction in hyperuniformity relative to the others. These findings suggest that wetting asymmetry can act as a control parameter for spatial order in multicomponent fluids.

Title: Brightening interlayer excitons by electric-field-driven hole transfer in bilayer WSe2
Authors: Tianyi Ouyang, Erfu Liu, Soonyoung Cha, Raj Kumar Paudel, Yiyang Sun, Zhaoran Xu, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Nathaniel M. Gabor, Yia-Chung Chang, Chun Hung Lui
Abstract: We observe the interlayer A1s^I, A2s^I, and B1s^I excitons in bilayer WSe2 under applied electric fields using reflectance contrast spectroscopy. Remarkably, these interlayer excitons remain optically bright despite being well separated from symmetry-matched intralayer excitons-a regime where conventional two-level coupling models fail unless unphysically large coupling strengths are assumed. To uncover the origin of this brightening, we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations and find that the applied electric field distorts the valence-band Bloch states, driving the hole wavefunction from one layer to the other. This field-driven interlayer hole transfer imparts intralayer character to the interlayer excitons, thereby enhancing their oscillator strength without requiring hybridization with bright intralayer states. Simulations confirm that this mechanism accounts for the major contribution to the observed brightness, with excitonic hybridization playing only a minor role. Our results identify interlayer hole transfer as a robust and general mechanism for brightening interlayer excitons in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), especially when inter- and intralayer excitons are energetically well separated.

Title: Alter-Piezoresponse in Two-Dimensional Lieb-Lattice Altermagnets
Authors: Xilong Xu, Li Yang
Abstract: Altermagnetism, featuring alternating spin structures in reciprocal space, has sparked growing interest. Here, we predict novel real-space alternative piezomagnetic and piezoelectric responses in an emerging altermagnetic family of Lieb lattices, specifically transition-metal chalcogenides M2WS4 (M = Mn, Fe, Co). The unique S4T crystal-spin symmetry leads to distinct magnetic and electric responses depending on the direction of applied stress. When subjected to axial stress, they exhibit a giant piezomagnetic response, which is about one to two orders of magnitude larger than that of most piezomagnetic materials, while the residual C2 symmetry suppresses the piezoelectric effect. In contrast, diagonal stress induces an imbalance of oppositely aligned electric dipole moments and a significant piezoelectric response, while in-plane mirror symmetry inhibits the piezomagnetic effect. This alternative piezoresponse offers an unprecedented opportunity to precisely control electric and magnetic properties independently, opening new avenues for altermagnetic materials in high-fidelity multifunctional memory and sensor applications.

Title: Determining Exciton Binding Energy and Reduced Effective Mass in Metal Tri-Halide Perovskites from Optical and Impedance Spectroscopy Measurements
Authors: K. Lizárraga, J. A. Guerra, L. A. Enrique-Moran, E. Serquen, E. Ventura, Cesar E. P. Villegas, A. R. Rocha, P. Venezuela
Abstract: Accurate determination of the exciton binding energy and reduced effective mass in halide perovskites is of utmost importance for the selective design of optoelectronic devices. Although these properties are currently determined by several spectroscopic techniques, complementary theoretical models are often required to bridge macroscopic and microscopic properties. Here, we present a novel method to determine these quantities while fully accounting for polarization effects due to carrier interactions with longitudinal optical phonons. Our approach estimates the exciton-polaron binding energy from optical absorption measurements using a recently developed Elliott based Band Fluctuations model. The reduced effective mass is obtained via the Pollmann-Buttner exciton-polaron model, which is based on the Frohlich polaron framework, where the strength of the electron-phonon interaction arises from changes in the dielectric properties. The procedure is applied to the family of perovskites ABX3 (A = MA, FA, Cs; B = Pb; X = I, Br, Cl), showing excellent agreement with high field magnetoabsorption and other optical-resolved techniques. The results suggest that the Pollmann-Buttner model offers a robust and novel approach for determining the reduced effective mass in metal tri-halide perovskites and other polar materials exhibiting free exciton bands.

Title: Low-temperature "Depletion" of Superfluid Density
Authors: Viktor Berger, Nikolay Prokof'ev, Boris Svistunov
Abstract: Landau theory of superfluidity associates low-temperature flow of the normal component with the phonon wind. This picture does not apply to superfluids in which Galilean invariance is broken either by disorder, or porous media, or lattice potential, and the phonon wind is no longer responsible for depletion of the superfluid component. Based on Popov's hydrodynamic action with aharmonic terms, we present a general theory for temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness at low $T$, which reproduces Landau result as a special case when several parameters of the hydrodynamic action are fixed by the Galilean invariance. At the technical level, the theory of low-temperature depletion in a $d$-dimensional quantum superfluid maps onto the problem of finite-size corrections in a $(d+1)$-dimensional anisotropic (pseudo-)classical-field system with U(1)-symmetric complex-valued action. We validate our theory with numeric simulations of interacting lattice bosons and the J-current model. In a broader context, our approach reveals universal low-temperature thermodynamics of superfluids.

Title: Unconventional superlattice ordering in intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$
Authors: Shannon S. Fender, Noah Schnitzer, Wuzhang Fang, Lopa Bhatt, Dingbin Huang, Amani Malik, Oscar Gonzalez, Veronika Sunko, Lilia S. Xie, David A. Muller, Joseph Orenstein, Yuan Ping, Berit H. Goodge, D. Kwabena Bediako
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry and topology in magnetic materials makes it possible to engineer exotic phases and technologically useful properties. A key requirement for these pursuits is achieving control over local crystallographic and magnetic structure, usually through sample morphology (such as synthesis of bulk crystals versus thin-films) and application of magnetic or electric fields. Here we show that V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ can be crystallized in two ordered superlattices, distinguished by the periodicity of out-of-plane magnetic intercalants. Whereas one of these structures is metallic and displays the hallmarks of altermagnetism, the other superlattice, which has not been isolated before in this family of intercalation compounds, is a semimetallic noncollinear antiferromagnet that may enable access to topologically nontrivial properties. This observation of an unconventional superlattice structure establishes a powerful route for tailoring the tremendous array of magnetic and electronic behaviors hosted in related materials.

Title: Protein Drift-Diffusion in Membranes with Non-equilibrium Fluctuations arising from Gradients in Concentration or Temperature
Authors: D. Jasuja, P. J. Atzberger
Abstract: We investigate proteins within heterogeneous cell membranes where non-equilibrium phenomena arises from spatial variations in concentration and temperature. We develop simulation methods building on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to obtain stochastic hybrid continuum-discrete descriptions which track individual protein dynamics, spatially varying concentration fluctuations, and thermal exchanges. We investigate biological mechanisms for protein positioning and patterning within membranes and factors in thermal gradient sensing. We also study the kinetics of Brownian motion of particles with temperature variations within energy landscapes arising from heterogeneous microstructures within membranes. The introduced approaches provide self-consistent models for studying biophysical mechanisms involving the drift-diffusion dynamics of individual proteins and energy exchanges and fluctuations between the thermal and mechanical parts of the system. The methods also can be used for studying related non-equilibrium effects in other biological systems and soft materials.

Title: Observation of Dual Spin Reorientation Transitions in Polycrystalline CeCr$_x$Fe$_{1-x}$O$_3$(x=0.33 and 0.67)
Authors: Stephen Tsui, Sara J. Callori
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic behavior of polycrystalline CeCr$_x$Fe$_{1-x}$O$_3$ (x = 0, 0.33, 0.67, and 1) synthesized via solid state reaction. Rare earth orthoferrite and orthochromite materials are well known for exhibiting spin reorientation transitions. Cr$^{3+}$ doping in CeFeO$_3$ results in the unusual occurrence of two spin reorientation transitions, ${\Gamma}_4$(G$_x$, A$_y$, F$_z$) $\rightarrow$ ${\Gamma}_1$(A$_x$, G$_y$, C$_z$) near 230 K and ${\Gamma}_4$(G$_x$, A$_y$, F$_z$) $\rightarrow$ ${\Gamma}_2$(F$_x$, C$_y$, G$_z$) near 100 K. In addition, two Néel transitions are identified. The results indicate that CeCr$_x$Fe$_{1-x}$O$_3$ offers a rich collection of magnetic behaviors with application potential for spintronic devices.

Title: Tunable Competing Electronic Orders in Double Quantum Spin Hall Superlattices
Authors: Yi-Chun Hung, Chen-Hsuan Hsu, Arun Bansil
Abstract: Competing superconducting (SC) and density-wave orders are of key importance in generating unconventional superconductivity and emergent electronic responses. Quasi-one-dimensional models provide insight into these competing orders and suggest higher-dimensional realizations through coupled-wire constructions, but analysis of such systems remains limited. Recent studies suggest that double helical edge states (DHESs) in double quantum spin Hall insulators (DQSHIs) form a two-channel Luttinger liquid that exhibits SC and spin density wave (SDW) phases and their $\pi$-junction analogs. Here, we analyze weakly coupled DHESs from the surface of a periodically stacked layered structure consisting of DQSHIs and dielectrics, where inter-edge interactions approximately develop a tunable helical sliding Luttinger liquid (HSLL) order. Using a renormalization-group analysis, we construct phase diagrams and identify a regime of HSLL parameters that favor competing two-dimensional $\pi$-SC and $\pi$-SDW orders. We identify parameter regimes where the competing orders could be realized experimentally in nanoscale devices. Our study suggests a promising materials platform for exploring tunable $\pi$-SC and $\pi$-SDW orders in double quantum spin Hall superlattices.

Title: Anisotropic nonlinear transport in two-dimensional ferroelectrics
Authors: Qin Zhang, Xu Chen, Mingbo Dou, M. Ye. Zhuravlev, A. V. Nikolaev, Xianjie Wang, L. L. Tao
Abstract: The longitudinal nonlinear response plays a crucial role in the nonreciprocal charge transport and may provide a simple electrical means to probe the spin-orbit coupling, magnetic order and polarization states, etc. Here, we report on a study on the polarization and magnetic field control of longitudinal nonlinear transport in two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics with in-plane polarization. Based on the Boltzmann transport theory, we first study that using a general Hamiltonian model and show that the nonlinear conductivity can be significantly tuned by the polarization and magnetic field. In addition, the nonlinear conductivity reveals a strong spatial anisotropy. We further derive the analytical formulas for the anisotropic nonlinear conductivity in exact accordance with numerical results. Then, we exemplify those phenomena in the 2D ferroelectric SnTe monolayer in the presence of an external magnetic field based on the density functional theory calculations. It is also revealed that the polarity of nonlinear conductivity is locked to the direction of the polarization, thus pointing to the possibility of the nonlinear detection of polarization states. Our work uncovers intriguing features of the longitudinal nonlinear transport in 2D ferroelectrics and provides guidelines for designing the polarization control of rectifying devices.

Title: Non-Bloch Band Theory for 2D Geometry-Dependent Non-Hermitian Skin Effect
Authors: Chenyang Wang, Jinghui Pi, Qinxin Liu, Yaohua Li, Yong-Chun Liu
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by boundary-localized eigenstates under open boundary conditions, represents the key feature of the non-Hermitian lattice systems. Although the non-Bloch band theory has achieved success in depicting the NHSE in one-dimensional (1D) systems, its extension to higher dimensions encounters a fundamental hurdle in the form of the geometry-dependent skin effect (GDSE), where the energy spectra and the boundary localization of the eigenstates rely on the lattice geometry. In this work, we establish the non-Bloch band theory for two-dimensional (2D) GDSE, by introducing a strip generalized Brillouin zone (SGBZ) framework. Through taking two sequential 1D thermodynamic limits, first along a major axis and then along a minor axis, we construct geometry-dependent non-Bloch bands, unraveling that the GDSE originates from the competition between incompatible SGBZs. Based on our theory, we derive for the first time a crucial sufficient condition for the GDSE: the non-Bloch dynamical degeneracy splitting of SGBZ eigenstates, where a continuous set of degenerate complex momenta breaks down into a discrete set. Moreover, our SGBZ formulation reveals that the Amoeba spectrum contains the union of all possible SGBZ spectra, which bridges the gap between the GDSE and the Amoeba theory. The proposed SGBZ framework offers a universal roadmap for exploring non-Hermitian effects in 2D lattice systems, opening up new avenues for the design of novel non-Hermitian materials and devices with tailored boundary behaviors.

Title: Detecting secondary-phase in bainite microstructure through deep-learning based single-shot approach
Authors: Vinod Kumar, Sharukh Hussain, Vishwas Subramanian, P G Kubendran Amos
Abstract: Relating properties and processing conditions to multiphase microstructures begins with identifying the constituent phases. In bainite, distinguishing the secondary phases is an arduous task, owing to their intricate morphology. In this work, deep-learning techniques deployed as object-detection algorithms are extended to realise martensite-austenite (MA) islands in bainite microstructures, which noticeably affect their mechanical properties. Having explored different techniques, an extensively trained regression-based algorithm is developed to identify the MA islands. This approach effectively detects the secondary phases in a single-shot framework without altering the micrograph dimensions. The identified technique enables scalable, automated detection of secondary phase in bainitic steels. This extension of the detection algorithm is suitably prefaced by an analysis exposing the inadequacy of conventional classification approaches in relating the processing conditions and composition to the bainite microstructures with secondary phases.

Title: Strain-Induced Non-alter Compensated Magnet and Its Application to Magnetic Tunnel Junction Device Design
Authors: Fangqi Liu, Yanrong Song, Zhenhua Zhang, Yong Liu, Sicong Zhu, Zhihong Lu, Rui Xiong
Abstract: The recent proposal of altermagnetism has drawn widespread attention to antiferromagnet (AFM) exhibiting spin splitting, extending beyond the realm of sign-alternating spin splitting in momentum space protected solely by rotational symmetry. Herrin, we propose a shear-strain strategy that enables significant modulation of d-wave altermagnets into an non-alter compensated magnets. A comprehensive analysis combining the magnetic moment compensation characteristics of opposite spin sublattices with the distribution of spin-resolved conduction channels in momentum space under the [001] crystal orientation reveals that shear strain breaks the rotational symmetry of alternatmagnets. To explore the application potential of non-alter compensated magnets, we designe RuO2/TiO2/RuO2 magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) with three crystallographic orientations ((001), (110), (100)) and investigated their transport properties under shear strain. This non-alter electronic structure not only enhances the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in spin-split paths of intrinsic RuO2 (226% to 431%) but also enables substantial TMR in spin-degenerate paths (from 0-88%)). Our work provides guidelines for broadening magnetic materials and device platforms.

Title: The mechanics of disclination emergence in 3D active nematics
Authors: Yingyou Ma, Christopher Amey, Aparna Baskaran, Michael F. Hagan
Abstract: The spontaneous creation of disclinations is a defining characteristic of active nematics, which is rarely observed in equilibrium systems or other active matter systems. Thus, understanding the mechanics of disclinations is crucial for developing reliable continuum theories and practical applications. In this work, we explore this intrinsic mechanics by performing large-scale 3D simulations of a particle-based model of active semiflexible filaments. We investigate the effects of filament stiffness and activity on the collective behavior of active nematics. Analysis of the steady state and the topological properties of initial disclination loops reveals that the system is governed by a single parameter, an activity-dependent effective stiffness. Then, we develop a method to visualize director field orientations in a physically transparent manner during the formation of disclination loops. Based on this, we establish a unified theory for the mechanics of disclination emergence, across the range of bend and twist. This disclination analysis framework can also be applied to diverse other 3D liquid crystal systems.

Title: Dislocation Engineering: A New Key to Enhancing Ceramic Performances
Authors: Haoxuan Wang, Yifan Wang, Xu Liang, Wenshan Yu, Xufei Fang, Shengping Shen
Abstract: Dislocations are line defects in crystalline solids and often exert a significant influence on the mechanical properties of metals. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using dislocations in ceramics to enhance materials performance. However, dislocation engineering has frequently been deemed uncommon in ceramics owing to the brittle nature of ceramics. Contradicting this conventional view, various approaches have been used to introduce dislocations into ceramic materials without crack formation, thereby paving the way for controlled ceramics performance. However, the influence of dislocations on functional properties is equally complicated owing to the intricate structure of ceramic materials. Furthermore, despite numerous experiments and simulations investigating dislocation-controlled properties in ceramics, comprehensive reviews summarizing the effects of dislocations on ceramics are still lacking. This review focuses on some representative dislocation-controlled properties of ceramic materials, including mechanical and some key functional properties, such as transport, ferroelectricity, thermal conductivity, and superconducting properties. A brief integration of dislocations in ceramic is anticipated to offer new insights for the advancement of dislocation engineering across various disciplines.

Title: Size-Dependent Tensile Behavior of Nanocrystalline HfNbTaTiZr High-Entropy Alloy: Roles of Solid-Solution and Short-Range Order
Authors: Yihan Wu, Gaosheng Yan, Pengfei Yu, Yaohong Suo, Wenshan Yu, Shengping Shen
Abstract: This study investigates the size-dependent mechanical behavior of the HfNbTaTiZr refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA) under uniaxial tension, with a focus on the effects of random solid-solution (RSS) and chemical short-range order (CSRO). A machine learning framework is developed to accelerate the parameterization of interatomic force fields (FFs), enabling molecular dynamics simulations of three nanocrystalline models: (i) a meta-atom (MA) mode representing the RHEA as a hypothetical sing-element system with averaged properties, (ii) a quinary RSS model with randomly distributed constituent atoms, and (iii) a Monte Carlo (MC) model with internal CSRO. The results reveal that RSS enhances strength, while CSRO reduces flow stress level but improves strain hardening and failure resistance. A transition from Hall-Petch (HP) strengthening to inverse Hall-Petch (IHP) softening is observed, with CSRO suppressing this transition. The underlying plastic mechanisms (i.e., dislocation slip, deformation twinning, phase transformation and grain boundary movements) are analyzed from both nanostructural and energetic perspectives. Theoretical models are established to describe the size-dependent yield strength and predict the critical grain size. Additionally, the contributions of different plastic mechanisms to the overall stress response are separately quantified. These findings provide new insights into the design and performance optimization of RHEAs through nanostructural engineering.

Title: Actively induced supercoiling can slow down plasmid solutions by trapping the threading entanglements
Authors: Roman Staňo, Renáta Rusková, Dušan Račko, Jan Smrek
Abstract: Harnessing the topology of ring polymers as a design motif in functional nanomaterials is becoming a promising direction in the field of soft matter. For example, the ring topology of DNA plasmids prevents the relaxation of excess twist introduced to the polymer, instead resulting in helical supercoiled structures. In equilibrium semi-dilute solutions, tightly supercoiled rings relax faster than their torsionally relaxed counterparts, since the looser conformations of the latter allow for rings to thread through each other and entrain via entanglements. Here we use molecular simulations to explore a non-equilibrium scenario, in which a supercoiling agent, akin to gyrase enzymes, rapidly induces supercoiling in the suspensions of relaxed plasmids. The activity of the agent not only alters the conformational topology from open to branched, but also locks-in threaded rings into supramolecular clusters, which relax very slowly. Ultimately, our work shows how the polymer topology under non-equilibrium conditions can be leveraged to tune dynamic behavior of macromolecular systems, suggesting a pathway to novel class of driven materials glassified by activity.

Title: Symmetry, microscopy and spectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism
Authors: Tomas Jungwirth, Jairo Sinova, Rafael M. Fernandes, Qihang Liu, Hikaru Watanabe, Shuichi Murakami, Satoru Nakatsuji, Libor Smejkal
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a collinear compensated magnetically-ordered phase with a d, g or i-wave anisotropy and alternating spin polarization of the electronic structure in the position and momentum space. Its recent discovery was in part motivated by the research of compensated magnets towards highly scalable spintronic technologies. Simultaneously, altermagnetism shares the anisotropic higher-partial-wave nature of ordering with unconventional superfluid phases which have been at the forefront of research for the past several decades. These examples illustrate the interest in altermagnetism from a broad range of science and technology perspectives. After summarizing the diverse research context, we turn the focus of this review to the symmetry, microscopy and spectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism. We start from the description of spontaneously broken and retained symmetries which delineate the compensated altermagnetic ordering as a distinct magnetic phase. Next we focus on microscopic signatures and ordering mechanism of the altermagnetic phase. We highlight crystal-structure realizations of a characteristic ferroic order of anisotropic higher-partial-wave components of atomic-scale spin densities in altermagnets, ranging from weakly-interacting metals to strongly correlated insulators. The symmetry and microscopy signatures of altermagnetism are directly reflected in spin-dependent electronic spectra and responses. We review salient band-structure features originating from the altermagnetic ordering, and from its interplay with spin-orbit coupling and topological phenomena. Throughout the review we compare altermagnetism to traditional ferromagnetism and Neel antiferromagntism, and to the currently intensely explored magnetic phases with non-collinear symmetry-protected compensated spin orders. We accompany the theoretical discussions by references to relevant experiments.

Title: Ising spin-1/2 XXZ chain's quantum problems beyond the spinon paradigm
Authors: J. M. P. Carmelo, P. D. Sacramento
Abstract: Spin chains are correlated quantum models of great interest in quantum systems and materials exhibiting quasi-one-dimensional magnetic properties. Here we review results on quantum problems associated with spin chains that are beyond the usual spinon paradigm. In this review we consider two quantum problems that are beyond the spinon representation: (a) Spin Bethe strings of length n that have no spinon representation, contribute to the dynamical properties of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with anisotropy larger than 1 and for n=1,2,3 were experimentally identified and realized in the zigzag materials SrCo2V2O8 and BaCo2V2O8; (b) The spin stiffness associated with ballistic spin transport at arbitrary finite temperature, which involves a huge number of energy eigenstates, many of which are generated in the thermodynamic limit from ground states by an infinite number of elementary processes.

Title: Gigantic Harmonic Generation in Néel-Torque Antiferromagnetic Resonance
Authors: Kuangyin Deng, Ran Cheng
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the resonant and higher-harmonic magnetic responses of a collinear antiferromagnet induced by Néel spin-orbit torques (NSOTs). By deriving the dynamical susceptibilities up to the third harmonic, we find remarkable NSOT-induced amplifications of the linear and nonlinear magnetic dynamics by orders of magnitude compared to conventional spin-orbit torques, enabling highly-efficient frequency conversion in the sub-terahertz frequency range. We then propose a multilayer antiferromagnetic nano-device leveraging the gigantic harmonic generation to achieve unprecedented frequency amplifiers and converters. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked role of the NSOTs in nonlinear dynamics.

Title: First-Principles Nanocapacitor Simulations of the Optical Dielectric Constant in Water Ice
Authors: Anthony Mannino, Graciele M. Arvelos, Kedarsh Kaushik, Emilio Artacho, Pablo Ordejon, Alexandre R. Rocha, Luana S. Pedroza, Marivi Fernández-Serra
Abstract: We introduce a combined density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) framework to compute the capacitance of nanocapacitors and directly extract the dielectric response of a sub-nanometer dielectric under bias. We identify that at the nanoscale conventional capacitance evaluations based on stored charge per unit voltage suffer from an ill-posed partitioning of electrode and dielectric charge. This partitioning directly impacts the geometric definition of capacitance through the capacitor width, which in turn makes the evaluation of dielectric response uncertain. This ambiguous separation further induces spurious interfacial polarizability when analyzed via maximally localized Wannier functions. Focusing on crystalline ice, we develop a robust charge-separation protocol that yields unique capacitance-derived polarizability and dielectric constants, unequivocally demonstrating that confinement neither alters ice's intrinsic electronic response nor its insensitivity to proton order. Our results lay the groundwork for rigorous interpretation of capacitor measurements in low-dimensional dielectric materials.

Title: Energetic variational modeling of active nematics: coupling the Toner-Tu model with ATP hydrolysis
Authors: Yiwei Wang
Abstract: We present a thermodynamically consistent energetic variational model for active nematics driven by ATP hydrolysis, with a focus on the coupling between chemical reactions and mechanical dynamics. Extending the classical Toner-Tu framework, we introduce a chemo-mechanical coupling mechanism in which the self-advection and polarization dynamics are modulated by the ATP hydrolysis rate. The model is derived using an energetic variational approach that integrates both chemical free energy and mechanical energy into a unified energy-dissipation law. The reaction rate equation explicitly incorporates mechanical feedback, revealing how active transport and alignment interactions influence chemical fluxes and vice versa. This formulation not only preserves consistency with nonequilibrium thermodynamics but also provides a transparent pathway for modeling energy transduction in active systems. We also present numerical simulations demonstrating how ATP consumption drives the merging of topological defects and enables the system to escape a quasi-equilibrium, a phenomenon not observed in passive nematic systems. This framework offers new insights into energy transduction and regulation mechanisms in biologically related active systems.

Title: Superconducting exchange coupling driven bistable and absolute switching
Authors: Sonam Bhakat, Avradeep Pal
Abstract: As per de Gennes predictions, a superconducting layer placed between two ferromagnetic insulators can drive an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between them. Using two ferromagneticinsulating GdN layers having dissimilar switching fields sandwiching a superconducting Vanadium thin film, we demonstrate evidence of such exchange coupling. We demonstrate that such an exchange coupling promotes switching between zero and finite resistance states of Vanadium. Our devices hold either a finite resistance or a zero-resistance state at zero magnetic field, dependent on their magnetic field history. Moreover, we demonstrate the absolute switching effect, thus making such devices suitable for application at the lowest temperatures as non-volatile cryogenic memory useful for futuristic quantum circuits and for several other superconducting spintronic applications.

Title: Band-Gap Tunability in Anharmonic Perovskite-like Semiconductors Driven by Polar Electron-Phonon Coupling
Authors: Pol Benítez, Ruoshi Jiang, Siyu Chen, Cibrán López, Josep-Lluís Tamarit, Edgardo Saucedo, Bartomeu Monserrat, Claudio Cazorla
Abstract: The ability to finely tune optoelectronic properties in semiconductors is crucial for the development of advanced technologies, ranging from photodetectors to photovoltaics. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to achieve such tunability by utilizing electric fields to excite low-energy polar optical phonon modes, which strongly couple to electronic states in anharmonic semiconductors. We conducted a high-throughput screening of over $10,000$ materials, focusing on centrosymmetric compounds with imaginary polar phonon modes and suitable band gaps, and identified $310$ promising candidates with potential for enhanced optoelectronic tunability. From this set, three perovskite-like compounds --Ag$_3$SBr, BaTiO$_3$, and PbHfO$_3$-- were selected for in-depth investigation based on their contrasting band-gap behavior with temperature. Using first-principles calculations, \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations, tight-binding models, and anharmonic Fröhlich theory, we analyzed the underlying physical mechanisms. Our results show that polar phonon distortions can induce substantial band-gap modulations at ambient conditions, including reductions of up to $70\%$ in Ag$_3$SBr and increases of nearly $23\%$ in BaTiO$_3$, relative to values calculated at zero temperature, while PbHfO$_3$ exhibits minimal change. These contrasting responses arise from distinct electron-phonon coupling mechanisms and orbital hybridization at the band edges. This work establishes key design principles for harnessing polar lattice dynamics to engineer tunable optoelectronic properties, paving the way for adaptive technologies such as wavelength-selective optical devices and solar absorbers.

Title: Thermodynamic properties of CrMnFeCoNi high entropy alloy at elevated electronic temperatures
Authors: Nikita Medvedev
Abstract: The Cantor alloy (equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi) is a high-entropy alloy with unique physical properties and radiation resistance. To model its response to intense laser pulses, the parameters of the electronic ensemble are required. In this work, the electronic heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling strength at elevated electronic temperatures are evaluated using a combined approach that incorporates tight-binding molecular dynamics and the Boltzmann equation. The damage threshold fluence is estimated for a wide range of photon energies, from XUV to hard X-rays. It is found that at the electronic temperatures ~24,000 K (absorbed dose ~6 eV/atom), the Cantor alloy experiences nonthermal melting due to modification of the interatomic potential induced by electronic excitation, even without the increase of the atomic temperature. This effect must be included in reliable models of CrMnFeCoNi ablation under ultrafast laser irradiation.

Title: Josephson diode effect: a phenomenological perspective
Authors: Da Wang, Qiang-Hua Wang, Congjun Wu
Abstract: As a novel quantum phenomenon with nonreciprocal supercurrent, the Josephson diode effect was intensively studied in recent years. Here, we construct a generalized resistively capacitance shunted junction (RCSJ) model as a low-energy effective/phenomenological theory for a general Josephson junction. For the ideal diode effect defined by unequal critical currents $|I_{c+}|\ne|I_{c-}|$, both inversion $\mathcal{I}$ and time-reversal $\mathcal{T}$ symmetries are required to be broken. It can be further divided into two classes: intrinsic ($\mathcal{T}$-breaking for the junction itself) and extrinsic ($\mathcal{T}$-breaking under external current reversion). In addition, a pseudo diode effect ($\mathcal{T}$-breaking not necessary) can be defined by $|I_{c+}|=|I_{c-}|$ but unequal retrapping currents $|I_{r+}|\ne|I_{r-}|$, for which noise current is further shown to produce the diode feature effectively. Finally, when radio-frequency AC external current exists, the Shapiro steps appear and can be used to distinguish the above three types of the diode effect. Our work provides a unified framework for studying the Josephson diode effect and can be applied to design workable superconducting circuits incorporating the Josephson diode as a fundamental circuit element.

Title: Quantitative electron beam-single atom interactions enabled by sub-20-pm precision targeting
Authors: Kevin M. Roccapriore, Frances M. Ross, Julian Klein
Abstract: The ability to probe and control matter at the picometer scale is essential for advancing quantum and energy technologies. Scanning transmission electron microscopy offers powerful capabilities for materials analysis and modification, but sample damage, drift, and scan distortions hinder single atom analysis and deterministic manipulation. Materials analysis and modification via electron-solid interactions could be transformed by precise electron delivery to a specified atomic location, maintaining the beam position despite drift, and minimizing collateral dose. Here we develop a fast, low-dose, sub-20-pm precision electron beam positioning technique, atomic lock-on, (ALO), which offers the ability to position the beam on a specific atomic column without previously irradiating that column. We use this technique to lock onto the same selected atomic location to repeatedly measure its weak electron energy loss signal despite sample drift. Moreover, we quantitatively measure electron beam matter interactions of single atomic events with microsecond time resolution. This enables us to observe single atom dynamics such as atomic bistability in the electron microscope, revealing partially bonded atomic configurations and recapture phenomena. We discuss the prospects for high-precision measurements and deterministic control of matter for quantum technologies using electron microscopy.

Title: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain
Authors: Jingya Wang, Zenan Liu, Bin-Bin Mao, Zijian Xiong, Zhe Wang, Zheng Yan
Abstract: It is generally believed that spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry is restricted by Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. A special case is that the 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain holds long-range order because the order parameter commutes with the Hamiltonian. The other one is that the recently found frustration-free Hamiltonians can bypass this theorem, but the observed symmetry breaking is fragile under generic perturbations. In this work, we have discovered a new example that goes beyond the above two examples -- a 1D antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model -- that can achieve spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry. Importantly, it is not a frustration-free model and its order parameter does not commute with the Hamiltonian. Moreover, the long-range order is robust under symmetry-preserving perturbations. Combining numerical simulation and theoretical analysis, we have further confirmed and understood this nontrivial phenomenon.

Title: Exact treatment of rotation-induced modifications in two-dimensional quantum rings
Authors: Carlos Magno O. Pereira, Frankbelson dos S. Azevedo, Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: We investigate the influence of rotation on the Fermi energy, magnetization, and persistent current in two-dimensional quantum rings. Using the Tan-Inkson confinement potential and incorporating rotational effects through a non-inertial coupling, we derive analytical expressions for the energy levels and examine the modifications induced by rotation. We then numerically explore how variations in angular velocity affect the Fermi energy, magnetization, and persistent current. Our results show that rotation has a significant impact on these physical properties, underscoring the importance of considering rotational effects in quantum ring systems. This suggests that rotation could serve as a control parameter in the development of new mesoscopic devices, without the need for additional fields or geometric modifications.

Title: Spiral dislocation as a tunable geometric parameter for optical responses in quantum rings
Authors: Hassan Hassanabadi, Kangxian Guo, Liangliang Lu, Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: We investigate the optical and quantum mechanical properties of a charged spinless particle confined in a two-dimensional quantum ring under the simultaneous influence of a spiral dislocation and an external magnetic field. The dislocation is modeled by a torsion-induced metric that alters the spatial geometry without introducing curvature. Using the minimal coupling procedure in curved space, we derive a modified Schrödinger equation incorporating both topological and electromagnetic effects. The geometric deformation leads to an energy-dependent effective potential, enabling a tunable control over the bound-state spectrum. We analyze how the spiral dislocation modifies the absorption coefficient, refractive index variation, and photoionization cross-section. The results demonstrate that the dislocation not only shifts the resonance peaks but also enhances or suppresses specific optical transitions depending on the angular momentum. These findings open up possibilities for geometrically tuning light-matter interactions in topological quantum devices.

Title: Tunable Field-Linked $s$-wave Interactions in Dipolar Fermi Mixtures
Authors: Jing-Lun Li, Georgios M. Koutentakis, Mateja Hrast, Mikhail Lemeshko, Andreas Schindewolf, Ragheed Alhyder
Abstract: Spin mixtures of degenerate fermions are a cornerstone of quantum many-body physics, enabling superfluidity, polarons, and rich spin dynamics through $s$-wave scattering resonances. Combining them with strong, long-range dipolar interactions provides highly flexible control schemes promising even more exotic quantum phases. Recently, microwave shielding gave access to spin-polarized degenerate samples of dipolar fermionic molecules, where tunable $p$-wave interactions were enabled by field-linked resonances available only by compromising the shielding. Here, we study the scattering properties of a fermionic dipolar spin mixture and show that a universal $s$-wave resonance is readily accessible without compromising the shielding. We develop a universal description of the tunable $s$-wave interaction and weakly bound tetratomic states based on the microwave-field parameters. The $s$-wave resonance paves the way to stable, controllable and strongly-interacting dipolar spin mixtures of deeply degenerate fermions and supports favorable conditions to reach this regime via evaporative cooling.

Title: Tension-Induced Soft Stress and Viscoelastic Bending in Liquid Crystal Elastomers for Enhanced Energy Dissipation
Authors: Beijun Shen, Yuefeng Jiang, Christopher M. Yakacki, Sung Hoon Kang, Thao D. Nguyen
Abstract: Architected materials that harness elastic snap-through buckling can trap energy reversibly. Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) exhibit excellent dissipation capabilities due to polymer network viscoelasticity and rate-dependent soft stress behavior associated with mesogen rotation. Incorporating LCEs into buckling lattice structures enhances energy absorption; however, conventional design cannot take advantage of the dissipation mechanism associated with mesogen rotation because buckling occurs at strains below the threshold of the soft stress response. In this study, we investigate tension-induced mesogen rotation as an additional dissipation mechanism in horizontal members of structures composed of tilted LCE beams under compression. Viscoelastic properties of LCEs with two crosslinking densities were characterized experimentally, and a nonlinear viscoelastic user-defined element was implemented in Abaqus/Standard to capture finite-strain behavior, including soft stress effects. Simulations and experiments revealed a non-monotonic dependence of energy dissipation on the thickness ratio between horizontal and tilted LCE members. Optimized structures with stretchable horizontal bars dissipated 2-3 times more energy than rigid-bar counterparts by balancing tension-driven soft stress with viscoelastic beam bending. Energy contributions from mesogen rotation and polymer network viscoelasticity were quantified. These findings inform the design strategies for LCE-based architected materials to enhance dissipation.

Title: The effect of droplet configurations within the Functional Renormalization Group of low-dimensional Ising models
Authors: Ivan Balog, Lucija Nora Farkaš, Maroje Marohnić, Gilles Tarjus
Abstract: We explore the application of the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (NPFRG) within its most common approximation scheme based on truncations of the derivative expansion to the $Z_2$-symmetric scalar $\varphi^4$ theory as the lower critical dimension $d_{\rm lc}$ is approached. We aim to assess whether the NPFRG - a broad, nonspecialized method which is accurate in $d\geq 2$ - can capture the effect of the localized (droplet) excitations that drive the disappearance of the phase transition in $d_{\rm lc}$ and control the critical behavior as $d\to d_{\rm lc}$. We extend a prior analysis to the next (second) order of the derivative expansion, which turns out to be much more involved. Through extensive numerical and analytical work we provide evidence that the convergence to $d_{\rm lc}$ is nonuniform in the field dependence and is characterized by the emergence of a boundary layer near the minima of the fixed-point effective potential. This is the mathematical mechanism through which the NPFRG within the truncated derivative expansion reproduces nontrivial features predicted by the droplet theory of Bruce and Wallace [1,2], namely, the existence of two distinct small parameters as $d\to d_{\rm lc}$ that control different aspects of the critical behavior and that are nonperturbatively related.

Title: Topotactic phase transformation in correlated vanadium dioxide through oxygen vacancy ordering
Authors: Xuanchi Zhou, Xiaohui Yao, Xiaomei Qiao, Jiahui Ji, Guowei Zhou, Huihui Ji, Xiaohong Xu
Abstract: Controlling the insulator-metal transition (IMT) in correlated oxide system through oxygen vacancy ordering opens up a new paradigm for exploring exotic structural transformation and physical functionality. Oxygen vacancy serves as a powerful tuning knob for adjusting the IMT property in VO2, though driving topochemical reduction to V2O3 remains challenging due to structural incompatibility and competing phase instability. Here we unveil consecutive oxygen-vacancy-driven VO2-VO2-x-V2O3 topotactic phase transformation route with enticing facet-dependent anisotropy, engendering tunable IMT properties over an extended temperature range. Remarkably, topochemically reduced V2O3 inherits the crystallographic characteristics from parent VO2, enabling emergent lattice framework and IMT behavior inaccessible via direct epitaxial growth. Analogous electron doping arising from hydrogenation and oxygen vacancy contributes cooperatively to drive the Mott phase transition in VO2 through band-filling control. Our work not only unveils sequential topotactic phase transformations in VO2 through oxygen vacancy ordering but also provides fundamentally new insights for defect-mediated Mott transitions.

Title: Multiple Photon Field-induced Topological States in Bulk HgTe
Authors: Dongbin Shin, I-Te Lu, Benshu Fan, Emil Vinas Bostrom, Hang Liu, Mark Kamper Svendsen, Simone Latini, Peizhe Tang, Angel Rubio
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions can be exploited to modify properties of quantum materials both in and out of thermal equilibrium. Recent studies suggest electromagnetic fields in photonic structures can hybridize with condensed matter systems, resulting in photon field-dressed collective quantum states such as charge density waves, superconductivity, and ferroelectricity. Here, we show that photon fields in photonic structures, including optical cavities and waveguides, induce emergent topological phases in solids through polarization-mediated symmetry-breaking mechanisms. Using state-of-the-art quantum electrodynamic density functional theory (QEDFT) calculations, we demonstrate that strong light-matter coupling can reconfigure both the electronic and ionic structures of HgTe, driving the system into Weyl, nodal-line, or topological insulator phases. These phases depend on the relative orientation of the sample in the photonic structures, as well as the coupling strength. Unlike previously reported laser-driven phenomena with ultrashort lifetimes, the photon field-induced symmetry breaking arises from steady-state photon-matter hybridization, enabling multiple robust topological states to emerge. Our study demonstrates that vacuum fluctuations in photonic structures can be used to engineer material properties and realize rich topological phenomena in quantum materials on demand.

Title: Seeding neural network quantum states with tensor network states
Authors: Ryui Kaneko, Shimpei Goto
Abstract: We find an efficient approach to approximately convert matrix product states (MPSs) into restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions consisting of a multinomial hidden unit through a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of the MPSs. This method allows us to generate well-behaved initial neural network quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial time of the number of variational parameters and systematically shorten the distance between the initial states and the ground states with increasing the rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.

Title: First-Principles Insights into Excitonic and Electron-Phonon Effects in van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: Mohammad Ali Mohebpour, Carmine Autieri, Meysam Bagheri Tagani
Abstract: Motivated by the successful synthesis of isolated ZrS2 and HfS2 transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers and inspired by their nearly identical lattice constants, we construct and investigate a vertical ZrS2/HfS2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure. Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), we explore its electronic, optical, and excitonic properties, with particular emphasis on excitonic effects and their temperature dependence. Based on the GW method, the ZrS2/HfS2 vdW heterostructure exhibits an indirect band gap of 2.60 eV with a Type-I band alignment. The optical gap of the heterostructure is found to be 2.64 eV, with an exciton binding energy of 0.71 eV, both reduced compared to those in the isolated monolayers. Moreover, we investigate the temperature-dependent optoelectronic behavior of the heterostructure, considering electron-phonon coupling. A zero-point renormalization of 0.04 eV in the direct band gap is observed. While the direct band gap decreases monotonically with temperature from 0 K to 400 K, the indirect band gap displays a non-monotonic trend. As a result, the absorption spectrum undergoes a meaningful redshift with increasing temperature. At room temperature, the optical gap of the heterostructure is reduced to 2.51 eV and the exciton binding energy to 0.63 eV. Our findings highlight the important role of electron-phonon interaction in the optoelectronic response of ZrS2/HfS2 vdW heterostructure, supporting its use in high-performance optoelectronic devices.

Title: Soft Coulomb Gap Limits the Performance of Organic Thermoelectrics
Authors: Yuqian Liu, Xiaoran Wei, Dorothea Scheunemann, Maojie Zhang, Wanlu Zhang, Martijn Kemerink, Guangzheng Zuo
Abstract: Although consensus exists that the thermoelectric properties of doped organic semiconductors result from a complex interplay between a large number of mutually dependent factors, there is no consensus on which of these are dominant, or even on how to best describe the charge and energy transport. This holds particularly in the intermediate doping regime where the optimal performance is typically observed at the roll-off in the Seebeck coefficient - conductivity (S-{\sigma} correlation, fundamentally limiting the rational advancement of organic thermoelectric materials. Here, we combine experiments on a board set of conjugated polymers with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations across varying doping levels to uncover a general transport framework. We demonstrate that the optimal thermoelectric power factor (PF_max) consistently occurs at the transition between conventional variable-range hopping (VRH) and VRH in a density of states in which a soft Coulomb gap forms at the Fermi level, as described by Efros and Shklovskii (ES-VRH). This suggests the use of high dielectric constant materials or the promotion of charge delocalization as an avenue to shift the roll-off of the S-{\sigma}} curve, which constrains PF_max, to higher doping levels and accordingly higher PF.

Title: Topological Electronic and phononic chiral edge states in SiTc Crystal
Authors: Shivendra Kumar Gupta, Saurabh Kumar Sen, Nagarjuna Patra, Ajit Singh Jhala, Poorva Singh
Abstract: Topological materials hosting multifold fermions and bosons have emerged as a rich platform for exploring unconventional quasiparticles and transport phenomena. In this work, we investigate the chiral crystal SiTc using first-principles density functional theory and symmetry-based analysis to explore its topological electronic and phononic properties. Our study identifies multiple high-fold degeneracies and topological nodes in both the electronic band structure and phonon dispersion. We have analyzed the impact of spin-orbit coupling on the evolution of band crossing and identified Weyl points and their associated chiralities. Surface electronic states, Fermi arcs, Berry curvature distributions, and intrinsic spin Hall conductivity are computed to probe the topological response. On the phononic side, we uncover topologically nontrivial bosonic modes and corresponding longest possible Fermi arc features. These results establish SiTc as a promising candidate that simultaneously hosts topological fermionic and bosonic excitations, offering new opportunities for investigating the interplay between electronic and phononic topology.

Title: A Rigorous Foundation for Stochastic Thermodynamics via the Microcanonical Ensemble
Authors: Xiangjun Xing
Abstract: We consider a small Hamiltonian system strongly interacting with a much larger Hamiltonian system (the bath), while being driven by both a time-dependent control parameter and non-conservative forces. The joint system is assumed to be thermally isolated. Under the assumption of time-scale separation (TSS)--where the bath equilibrates much faster than the system and the external driving--the bath remains in instantaneous equilibrium, described by the microcanonical ensemble conditioned on the system state and the control parameter. We identify a decomposition of the total Hamiltonian that renders the bath energy an adiabatic invariant under slow evolution. This same decomposition defines the system Hamiltonian as the Hamiltonian of mean force, and ensures that neither the system nor the control parameter does reactive work on the bath. Using time-reversal symmetry and TSS, and without invoking any model details, we rigorously prove that the reduced dynamics of the system is Markovian and satisfies a form of local detailed balance (LDB) which involves transition probabilities but not path probabilities. By working entirely within the microcanonical framework and adopting a precise decomposition of the total energy, we provide rigorous definitions of bath entropy as the Boltzmann entropy, and of heat as the negative change of the bath energy. Our approach bypasses the ambiguities associated with conventional definitions of thermodynamic variables and path probabilities, and establishes a rigorous and thermodynamically consistent foundation for stochastic thermodynamics, valid even under strong system-bath coupling.

Title: Establishment of global phase coherence in a highly disordered fractal MgO/MgB2 nanocomposite: Roles of interface, morphology and defect
Authors: Iku Nakaaki, Aoi Hashimoto, Shun Kondo, Yuichi Ikuhara, Shuuichi Ooi, Minoru Tachiki, Shunichi Arisawa, Akiko Nakamura, Taku Moronaga, Jun Chen, Hiroyo Segawa, Takahiro Sakurai, Hitoshi Ohta, Takashi Uchino
Abstract: Recently, we have reported that a highly disordered fractal MgO/MgB2 nanocomposite exhibits bulk-like superconducting properties with isotropic pinning, showing an excellent phase-coherent capability irrespective of the low volume fraction (~30 vol. %) of MgB2 [Uchino et al., Phys. Rev. B 101, 035146 (2020); Teramachi et al,, Phys. Rev. B 108, 155146 (2023)]. Hence, this nanocomposite provides a useful experimental system to investigate the relationship between the structural disorder and the establishment of the superconducting phase coherence. In this work, we show from 3D focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) data that in the nanocomposite, a complex MgO/MgB2 microstructure spreads isotropically throughout the sample with a constant fractal dimension of ~1.67. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has revealed that the MgO/MgB2 interfaces are atomically clean and free from amorphous grain boundaries, even leading to atomically coherent interfaces. Detailed ac susceptibility measurements have demonstrated a smooth crossover from an intragranular to an intergranular superconducting regime, giving evidence of the establishment of the critical state due to strong intergranular coupling just below the superconducting transition temperature. Also, spatially-resolved cathodoluminescence measurements have demonstrated that oxygen vacancies in the MgO-rich phase tend to aggregate near the MgO/MgB2 boundary regions, forming long channels of oxygen vacancies through the nanocomposite. These channels of oxygen vacancies will contribute to the long-range carrier transfer and the related Andreev reflection via coherent tunneling of charge carriers among the oxygen vacancy sites.

Title: Kerr microscopy study of magnetic domains and their dynamics in bulk Ni-Mn-Ga austenite
Authors: A. Perevertov, I. Soldatov, R. Schaefer, R.H. Colman, O. Heczko
Abstract: The observation of magnetic domains on austenite Ni-Mn-Ga bulk samples has been a big challenge for many years. Using advanced Kerr microscopy, with automatic compensation of the sample motion and monochromatic LED light we were able to observe magnetic domains and follow their evolution with magnetic field on the _100_ faces of an austenite bulk single crystal. After mechanical polishing variable fine stress-induced domains patterns were observed at different locations. The surface coercivity visualized by the Kerr loop was two orders higher than the bulk coercivity from magnetometry measurement. After additional electropolishing, wide 180 domains were observed with a width of about 50 micrometers and the Kerr loop coercivity decreased to the level determined from the magnetometry. Surprisingly, the magnetic domains were observed only along one of two _100_ cubic axes lying in the surface plane.

Title: Controlling the quantum phase transition in a double quantum dot Josephson junction via interactions
Authors: Cong Li, Yiyan Wang, Bing Dong
Abstract: In this work, we employ a surrogate BCS model with discrete energy levels to investigate a hybrid system comprising two quantum dots (QD1 and QD2), where QD1 is tunnel-coupled to two superconducting leads. Through exact diagonalization of this system, we obtain numerically exact solutions that enable rigorous computation of key physical quantities. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram featuring multiple controllable phase transitions mediated by quantum dot interactions. Specifically, the system first undergoes an initial phase transition when tuning QD2's interaction strength while maintaining QD1 in the non-interacting regime. Subsequent adjustment of QD1's interaction induces a secondary phase transition, followed by a third transition arising from inter-dot coupling modulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that parallel magnetic field application can drive reversible ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase transitions under specific parameter conditions. Finally, we report the emergence of non-local magnetization phenomena when subjecting QD1 to weak magnetic fields. And our results demonstrate that the orientation of nonlocal magnetization can be precisely manipulated through systematic adjustment of the on-site interaction strength $U_2$ in QD2.

Title: Precise quantum-geometric electronic properties from first principles
Authors: José Luís Martins, Carlos Loia Reis, Ivo Souza
Abstract: The calculation of quantum-geometric properties of Bloch electrons -- Berry curvature, quantum metric, orbital magnetic moment and effective mass -- was implemented in a pseudopotential plane-wave code. The starting point was the first derivative of the periodic part of the wavefunction psi_k with respect to the wavevector k. This was evaluated with perturbation theory by solving a Sternheimer equation, with special care taken to deal with degenerate levels. Comparison of effective masses obtained from perturbation theory for silicon and gallium arsenide with carefully-converged numerical second derivatives of band energies confirms the high precision of the method. Calculations of quantum-geometric quantities for gapped graphene were performed by adding a bespoke symmetry-breaking potential to first-principles graphene. As the two bands near the opened gap are reasonably isolated, the results could be compared with those obtained from an analytical two-band model, allowing to assess the strengths and limitations of such widely-used models. The final application was trigonal tellurium, where quantum-geometric quantities flip sign with chirality.

Title: High-mobility heavy quasiparticles in a van der Waals antiferromagnetic dense Kondo lattice CeTe$_3$
Authors: Hai Zeng, Yang Zhang, Bingke Ji, Jiaqiang Cai, Shuo Zou, Zhuo Wang, Chao Dong, Kangjian Luo, Yang Yuan, Kai Wang, Jinglei Zhang, Chuanyin Xi, Junfeng Wang, Yaomin Dai, Jing Li, Yongkang Luo
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit high carrier mobility and tunability, making them suitable for low-power, high-performance electronic and spintronic applications. Incorporating narrow-band electronic correlation effects could further promote tunability, though mass renormalization may impact carrier mobility. It is therefore challenging to identify a vdW material with both high mobility and strong correlation. Herein, by a combination of optical spectroscopy and high-field quantum-oscillation measurements, we observe significant effective-mass enhancement in CeTe$_3$ at low temperature, arising from not only the band-structure modulation by antiferromagnetic ordering but also the narrow-band correlation effect. Despite the mass enhancement, the quantum mobility surprisingly \textit{increases} and reaches $\sim$2403 cm$^2$/Vs, likely benefiting from topological protection. Remarkably, these unique properties are maintained in atomically thin nanoflakes with quantum mobility enhanced to $\sim$3158 cm$^2$/Vs. Thus, CeTe$_3$ emerges as a promising vdW antiferromagnetic metal with high-mobility heavy quasiparticles, potentially unlocking new device concepts.

Abstract: We have re-investigated the crystal structure of a spinel type CuIr2S4 at low temperatures using a single-crystal in a synchrotron radiation x-ray diffraction experiment. The crystal structure of the low-temperature phase of CuIr2S4 has been already studied by diffraction experiments using a powder sample, and it has been reported that the formation of dimer molecules accompanied by charge ordering of Ir has been achieved. The crystal structure of the low-temperature phase obtained in our reanalysis was the same as the previously reported structure in that it showed the formation of Ir dimers accompanied by charge ordering, but the charge ordering pattern and arrangement of the dimers in the unit cell were different. We will discuss the validity of the structure obtained in this study and provide the structural parameters revealed in the reanalysis. The results of this study should provide a basis for further studies of the physical properties of CuIr2S4, which are still being actively investigated.

Title: Dynamic modes of active Potts models with factorizable numbers of states
Authors: Hiroshi Noguchi
Abstract: We studied the long-term nonequilibrium dynamics of q-state Potts models with q = 4, 5, 6, and 8 using Monte Carlo simulations on a two-dimensional square lattice. When the contact energies between the nearest neighbors for the standard Potts models are used, cyclic changes in the q homogeneous phases and q-state coexisting wave mode appear at low and high flipping energies, respectively, for all values of q. However, for a factorizable q value, dynamic modes with skipping states emerge, depending on the contact energies. For q = 6, a spiral wave mode with three domain types (one state dominant or two states mixed) and cyclic changes in three homogeneous phases are found. Although three states can coexist spatially under thermal equilibrium, the scaling exponents of the transitions to the wave modes are modified from the equilibrium values.

Title: Development and validation of an electron temperature-dependent interaction potential for silicon and copper for the use in atomistic simulations of laser ablation
Authors: Simon Kümmel, Johannes Roth
Abstract: Laser pulses with a duration of the order of femtoseconds lead to a strong excitation, heating and potentially to ablation of the irradiated material. During the time of strong excitation, the interaction of the atoms and thus the material dynamics can be strongly altered. To take this effect into account, an ip was developed for copper that takes the excitation of the electrons into account up to an electron temperature of 1.2 eV. Furthermore, several ways to identify non-thermal effects in Density Functional Theory calculations and how to incorporate and validate them in molecular dynamics simulations are presented. Explicitly, the free energy curves, elastic constants and phonon spectra are compared. Additionally, it is shown that the change of the melting temperature with the degree of excitation is consistent with all of these properties. Moreover, the behaviour of copper upon excitation is compared to silicon by using a similar potential that was previously developed by a different author.

Title: Photonic obstructed atomic insulator
Authors: Hongyu Chen
Abstract: Topological quantum chemistry (TQC) classifies the topological phases by real-space invariant in which obstructed atomic insulators belong to the trivial case but sometimes show the feature of higher-order topological insulator. Here, for a two-dimensional magnetic photonic obstructed atomic insulator, we show that the emergence of corner states is associate with the Wyckoff positions. In such a square lattice with four +M elements and four -M elements, corner states appears when the superlattice exposes 2b Wyckoff positions. And the corner states will decrease when the number of exposed 2b Wyckoff positions decreases and disappear when 2b Wyckoff positions no longer stand at the edge. By arranging all magnetic rod into one magnetization direction, we find that time-reversal symmetry is not important for corner states. Our finding indicates that the real-space distribution of atoms determines the feature of higher-order topological insulators for obstructed atomic insulator in TQC.

Title: Reviewing Current-Driven Dynamics and Monte Carlo based Analysis of Thermodynamic Properties of a Magnetic Skyrmion Crystal
Authors: Rajdip Banerjee, Satyaki Kar
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions with its topologically protected, nano-sized spin textures have already earned immense fame as information carriers due to their stability and low-current mobility. While ferromagnetic skyrmions suffer from a transverse deflection (i.e., the skyrmion Hall effect), their anti-ferromagnetic counterparts promise straight-line motion and ultrafast dynamics. Here we present a numerical study of the dynamics of lattice-based antiferromagnetic skyrmions driven by spin-transfer torque for which the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation is solved using a fourth-order Range-Kutta integration. Then we conduct a detailed Monte Carlo study of the two-dimensional classical XY model to quantify how spatial anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) coupling reshape its thermal response across multiple lattice sizes. By tuning the ratio Jy/Jx, we document a systematic evolution of the specific-heat anomaly. For example, in the quasi-one-dimensional limit, CV exhibits a broad, low-temperature hump, whereas stronger anisotropy yields sharper peaks that migrate to higher inverse temperature. Finite-size scaling confirms the crossover from quasi-1D fluctuations to a two-dimensional Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Incorporating a DM interaction further enriches this landscape. At D/J = 0.1, the main peak shifts modestly upward and is slightly suppressed; raising D/J elevates the peak magnitudes and creates a pronounced low-temperature plateau. This residual CV signals enduring chiral excitations and complex spin-twist textures beyond simple vortex unbinding. Our findings chart how directional and chiral couplings can be harnessed to tune pseudo-critical temperatures and thermodynamic signatures in two-dimensional magnets, providing a practical blueprint for engineering topological spin systems.

Title: Two-Dimensional Materials-Based Josephson Junctions
Authors: Hamidreza Simchi
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional monolayer MoS2-based Josephson junction which is composed by an intermediate semiconductor flake and the semi-infinite topological and non-topological superconductor leads and study its quantum transport properties by using the tight-binding non-equilibrium Green function method. By introducing a simple tight-binding model, it is shown that, when the absolute value of chemical potential is much smaller than the superconductor paring potential, the Majorana zero modes, whose Chern number is two, are formed in the topological leads. Also, we show that, in Josephson junction with ordinary superconductor leads, the Josephson current has sinusoidal behavior (due to forming the Andreev bound states (ABS)), when the absolute value of energy of carriers (and the chemical potential) is much smaller (greater) than the superconductor pairing potential. Of course, for Josephson junction with topological superconductor leads, it is shown that the ABS are not formed and in consequence the related Josephson current is zero. Therefore, one can consider the two-dimensional monolayer MoS2-based Josephson junction as a two-state switch which is in open-state (due to ABS) when the chemical potential is greater than 0.8 eV and is in close-state (due to Majorana) when the chemical potential is less than < 0.8 or is equal to zero, i.e., ABS cannot mimic the Majorana state, as zero-bias conductance.

Title: EuPdSn2; magnetic structures in view of resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction
Authors: Stephen W. Lovesey
Abstract: The magnetic properties of materials hosting Eu2+(J = 7/2, 4f7) ions have attracted much attention in the science of strongly correlated electrons. In part because crystal electric field effects are impoverished for an s-state ion, as with Gd3+ intermetallics, and Eu2+ substitution in biological and optically active materials is resourceful. The magnetic structure of EuPdSn2 is not wholly resolved. Ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic structures coexist in powder neutron diffraction patterns, and compete in the ground state. Moreover, the specific heat as a function of temperature is enigmatic and indicative of J = 5/2. We present symmetry-informed analytic magnetic structure factors for single crystal resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction using Eu atomic resonances that reveal significant potential for the technique. Europium ions use acentric Wyckoff positions in magnetic space groups inferred from neutron diffraction. In consequence, axial and polar Eu multipoles are compulsory components of both magnetic neutron and resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction patterns. The proposed antiferromagnetic phase of EuPdSn2 supports anapoles (magnetic polar dipoles) already observed in magnetic neutron diffraction patterns presented by Gd doped SmAl2, and several resonant x-ray diffraction patterns.

Title: The Effects of Cobalt Doping on the Skyrmion Hosting Material Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$
Authors: M. Vás, A. J. Ferguson, H. E. Maynard-Casely, C. Ulrich, E. P. Gilbert, S. Yick, T. Söhnel
Abstract: Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ has fascinating magnetic phases that can be easily manipulated through chemical doping. In this work, we report on the synthesis and characterization of Co-doped Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ and its influence on both the atomic and magnetic structure. Polycrystalline (Cu$_{1_-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$OSeO$_3$ samples with 0 < x < 0.1 were synthesized and the presence of Co was confirmed via elemental analysis. Using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction, and high-resolution neutron powder diffraction, the incorporation of Co$^{2+}$ into the Cu2 sites was confirmed. Co-doping led to an expansion to the unit cell but shows no apparent changes in bond lengths and angles in the crystal structure. Magnetization measurements showed that the incorporation of Co$^{2+}$ into the Cu2 site led to significant changes to the magnetic ordering of the material. Including an increase to the critical fields, the lowering of the critical temperature of the helimagnetic phase, and both a lowering and expansion of the skyrmion pocket temperatures. Lastly, small-angle neutron scattering was used to probe the magnetic structures hosted by the material. It was found that upon doping, the skyrmion lattice nucleates at lower temperatures as well as stabilized over a large temperature range. The observed results highlight the effects of incorporating a magnetic ion into the crystal structure and how it affects the internal magnetic structures.

Abstract: High magnetic fields have proven instrumental in exploring the physical properties of condensed matter, leading to groundbreaking discoveries such as the quantum Hall effect in 2D heterostructures and quantum oscillations in cuprate superconductors. The ability to conduct precise measurements at progressively higher magnetic fields continues to push the frontiers of knowledge and enable new discoveries. In this work, we present the development of a microwave technique for performing two-point transport measurements in semi-destructive pulsed magnetic fields (up to 125 T) and at low temperatures (down to 1.5 K) with unprecedented sensitivity. This new setup was tested on a variety of samples. We present results on the metal-insulator transition in InAs and we report notably the first observation of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations in WTe$_{2}$ at magnetic fields beyond 100 T.

Title: Quantum polaritons go hyperbolic
Authors: Kateryna Domina, Tetiana Slipchenko, D.-H.-Minh Nguyen, Alexey B. Kuzmenko, Luis Martin-Moreno, Dario Bercioux, Alexey Y. Nikitin
Abstract: Magnetized charge-neutral graphene supports collective hybrid electronic excitations - polaritons - which have quantum origin. In contrast to polaritons in doped graphene, which arise from intraband electronic transitions, those in charge-neutral graphene originate from interband transitions between Landau levels, enabled by the applied magnetic field. Control of such quantum polaritons and shaping their wavefronts remains totally unexplored. Here we design an artificial two-dimensional quantum material formed by charge-neutral graphene nanoribbons exposed to an external magnetic field. In such metasurface, quantum polaritons acquire a hyperbolic dispersion. We find that the topology of the isofrequency curves of quantum hyperbolic magnetoexciton polaritons excited in this quantum material can change, so that the shape of isofrequency curves transforms from a closed to open one by tuning the external magnetic field strength. At the topological transition, we observe canalization phenomena, consisting of the propagation of all the polaritonic plane waves in the continuum along the same direction when excited by a point source. From a general perspective, our fundamental findings introduce a novel type of actively-tunable quantum polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion and can be further generalized to other types of quantum materials and polaritons in them. In practice, quantum hyperbolic polaritons can be used for applications related to quantum sensing and computing.

Title: Superconducting Ring Resonators: Modelling, Simulation, and Experimental Characterisation
Authors: Zhenyuan Sun, Stafford Withington, Christopher Thomas, Songyuan Zhao
Abstract: We present a theoretical and experimental study of superconducting ring resonators as an initial step towards their application to superconducting electronics and quantum technologies. These devices have the potentially valuable property of supporting two orthogonal electromagnetic modes that couple to a common Cooper pair, quasiparticle, and phonon system. We present here a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the superconducting ring resonator system. We have developed superconducting ring resonator models that describe the key features of microwave behaviour to first order, providing insights into how transmission line inhomogeneities give rise to frequency splitting and mode rotation. Furthermore, we constructed signal flow graphs for a four-port ring resonator to numerically validate the behaviour predicted by our theoretical analysis. Superconducting ring resonators were fabricated in both coplanar waveguide and microstrip geometries using Al and Nb thin films. Microwave characterisation of these devices demonstrates close agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study reveals that frequency splitting and mode rotation are prevalent in ring systems with coupled degenerate modes, and these phenomena become distinctly resolved in high quality factor superconducting ring resonators.

Title: Probing and tuning geometric frustration in an organic quantum magnet via elastocaloric measurements under strain
Authors: Francisco Lieberich, Yohei Saito, Yassine Agarmani, Takahiko Sasaki, Naoki Yoneyama, Stephen M. Winter, Michael Lang, Elena Gati
Abstract: Geometric frustration is a key ingredient in the emergence of exotic states of matter, such as the quantum spin liquid in Mott insulators. While there has been intense interest in experimentally tuning frustration in candidate materials, achieving precise and continuous control has remained a major hurdle -- particularly in accessing the properties of the ideally frustrated lattice. Here, we show that large, finely controlled anisotropic strains can effectively tune the degree of geometric frustration in the Mott insulating $\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ -- a slightly anisotropic triangular-lattice quantum magnet. Using thermodynamic measurements of the elastocaloric effect, we experimentally map out a temperature-strain phase diagram that captures both the ground state of the isotropic lattice and the less frustrated parent state. Our results provide a new benchmark for calculations of the triangular-lattice Hubbard model as a function of frustration and highlight the power of lattice engineering as a route to realizing perfectly frustrated quantum materials.

Title: Supersolid Phases in Ultracold Gases of Microwave Shielded Polar Molecules
Authors: Wei Zhang, Hongye Liu, Fulin Deng, Kun Chen, Su Yi, Tao Shi
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme to realize the supersolid phase in ultracold gases of microwave-shielded polar molecules by engineering an additional anisotropy in inter-molecular dipolar interaction via an elliptically polarized microwave. It is shown through quantum Monte-Carlo calculations that the interplay of the anisotropies between the interaction and trapping potential gives rise to rich quantum phases. Particularly, it is found that the supersolid phase emerges in the parameter regime accessible to current experiments. Our study paves the way for exploring the properties of supersolid phases in ultracold gases of polar molecules.

Title: Pressure and doping effects on the electronic structure and magnetism of the single-layer nickelate La$_2$NiO$_4$
Authors: J. B. de Vaulx, F. Bernardini, V. Olevano, Q. N. Meier, A. Cano
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_4$ is a prototypical member of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate series that offers a valuable reference point for elucidating the key ingredients behind the intriguing properties of these systems. However, the structural and electronic properties of La$_2$NiO$_4$ under pressure and doping remain surprisingly underexplored. Here, we investigate these properties using density-functional-theory calculations. We find that its tetragonal $I4/mmm$ structure can be stabilized, not only under comparatively low pressures of $\sim$ 8 GPa, but also at ambient pressure via the partial substitution of La with Ba. Moreover, we show that the combined effects of Ba substitution and pressure leads to qualitative changes in the electronic structure towards the formal $d^{7.5}$ configuration of the superconducting bilayer nickelates. Further, while La$_2$NiO$_4$ can undergo a insulator-metal transition with pressure retaining G-type antiferromagnetic order, La$_{1.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$NiO$_4$ exhibits metallic behavior with an enhanced competition between different magnetic states. Our results thus offer new insights into the interplay of structure, doping, and magnetism across the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate series.

Title: Anomalous Scaling Laws of Dispersion Interactions in Anisotropic Nanostructures
Authors: Hui Pan, Yuhua Ren, Jian-Sheng Wang
Abstract: The van der Waals (vdW) dispersion interaction between two finite neutral objects typically follows the standard nonretarded $d^{-6}$ law. Here, we reveal an anomalous $d^{-10}$ scaling law between nanostructures with strong geometric or electric anisotropy, driven intrinsically by symmetry-restricted plasmon interactions. At finite anisotropy ratios, a scaling crossover from $d^{-10}$ to $d^{-6}$ occurs due to plasmon mode competition, marked by a finite critical separation. Furthermore, we demonstrate tunability of interlayer vdW forces in two-dimensional materials with strong in-plane electronic anisotropy. By pushing the conventional lower bound of vdW scaling laws, these findings open new opportunities for tailoring nanoscale forces, with potential applications in low-stiction nanomechanical devices, vdW superstructure assembly, metamaterials, and molecular simulations.

Title: Decoding Noise in Nanofluidic Systems: Adsorption versus Diffusion Signatures in Power Spectra
Authors: Anna Drummond Young, Alice L. Thorneywork, Sophie Marbach
Abstract: Adsorption processes play a fundamental role in molecular transport through nanofluidic systems, but their signatures in measured signals are often hard to distinguish from other processes like diffusion. In this paper, we derive an expression for the power spectral density (PSD) of particle number fluctuations in a channel, accounting for diffusion and adsorption/desorption to a wall. Our model, validated by Brownian dynamics simulations, is set in a minimal yet adaptable geometry, allowing us to eliminate the effects of specific geometries. We identify distinct signatures in the PSD as a function of frequency $f$, including $1/f^{3/2}$ and $1/f^{1/2}$ scalings related to diffusive entrance and re-entrance effects, and a $1/f^2$ scaling associated with adsorption. These scalings appear in key predicted quantities -- the total number of particles in the channel and the number of adsorbed or unadsorbed particles -- and can dominate or combine in non-trivial ways depending on parameter values. Notably, when there is a separation of timescales between diffusion within the channel and adsorption/desorption times, the PSD can exhibit two distinct slopes in some of the predicted quantities. We provide a phase diagram to classify experimental systems based on predicted PSD shapes. These PSDs reflect measured properties in physical systems on the nano- and micro-scale, such as ion channels, nanopores, and electrochemical sensors, potentially offering insights into noisy experimental data.

Title: Superconducting gap and its Little-Parks like oscillations with high-order harmonics in lithium intercalated 1T-TiSe$_2$
Authors: Jia-Yi Ji, Zongzheng Cao, Yi Hu, Haoyang Wu, Heng Wang, Yuying Zhu, Haiwen Liu, Lexian Yang, Qi-Kun Xue, Ding Zhang
Abstract: The superconducting phase of doped 1T-TiSe$_2$ is a fruitful playground for exploring exotic quantum phenomena such as the anomalous metal state and spontaneously formed superconducting network. Here, we address these emergent states by studying the superconducting gap of lithium intercalated TiSe$_2$-a fundamental quantity that has remained unexplored so far. We fabricate a device that combines solid-state lateral lithium intercalation, resistance measurements and tunneling spectroscopy. We successfully probe the superconducting gap of TiSe$_2$ and reveal that the gap closing temperature well exceeds the transition temperature ($T_c$) expected from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, indicating pronounced superconducting fluctuations even in a bulk-like system. Moreover, the symmetric gap persists even in the anomalous metal state, demonstrating the particle-hole symmetry of this exotic phase directly from the density of states. Finally, the superconducting gap shows magneto-oscillations with higher harmonics, attesting to a rather regular structure of the intrinsic superconducting network.

Title: Density functional theory study of effect of NO annealing on electronic structures and carrier scattering properties of 4H-SiC(0001)/SiO$_2$ interface
Authors: Nahoto Funaki, Kosei Sugiyama, Mitsuharu Uemoto, Tomoya Ono
Abstract: The effect of the nitrided layer introduced by NO annealing on the electronic structure and carrier scattering property of the 4H-SiC(0001)/SiO$_2$ interface is investigated by the density functional theory calculation using the interface models where the areal N atom density corresponds to that in practical devices. The areal N atom density is one third of the areal C atom density in practical devices. It is found that the nitrided layer screens the unfavorable Coulomb interaction of O atoms in the SiO$_2$. However, the electrons flowing under the nitrided layer are significantly scattered by the fluctuation of potential due to the low areal N atom density. These results imply that the areal N atom density should be increased so that the fluctuation of potential is suppressed.

Title: Thermodynamics of Hard Sphere and Spherocylinder Mixtures -- Scaled Particle Theory and Monte Carlo Simulations
Authors: Volodymyr Shmotolokha (1), Jonas Maier-Borst (2), Mark Vis (1), Anja Kuhnhold (2), Remco Tuinier (1) ((1) Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands, (2) University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany)
Abstract: We review the literature on scaled particle theory (SPT) and its extensions and discuss results applied to describe the thermodynamics of hard particle mixtures. After explaining the basic concepts of scaled particle theory to compute the free energy of immersing a particle into a mixture, examples are discussed for the simple case of a hard sphere dispersion and the free volume fraction of ghost spheres in a hard sphere dispersion. Next, the concept is applied to mixtures, and general expressions are shown that relate the free volume fraction in mixtures to the key thermodynamic properties, such as the chemical potential(s) and (osmotic) pressure. Subsequently, it is revealed how these concepts can be extended towards multi-component systems. It is shown that free volume fractions provide chemical potentials and total pressure of multi-component mixtures, and thereby yield the full equation of state. We present novel results for ternary particle dispersions composed of hard spherocylinders and two types of hard spheres differing in size. Throughout, we show the accuracy of SPT by comparing the results with those of Monte Carlo computer simulations.

Title: Diffusion and heat dissipation in marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin systems
Authors: Xin Wang
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics and heat dissipation in marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin systems. We analytically characterize two distinct critical classes: (i) diffusive criticality, where the variance grows linearly with suppressed/enhanced diffusion due to time-delayed forces, and (ii) oscillatory criticality, exhibiting oscillations with diffusing amplitude. Crucially, we derive asymptotic heat dissipation rates, revealing fundamentally different thermodynamic signatures: a constant dissipation rate for diffusive criticality and linear divergence accompanied by oscillations for oscillatory criticality. These results highlight how spectral properties of dynamics govern nonequilibrium thermodynamics in time-delayed systems. Our work bridges dynamics and stochastic thermodynamics at stability boundaries for linear systems, providing foundational insights for extending thermodynamic frameworks to nonlinear time-delayed stochastic systems.

Title: Topological two-body interaction obstructing trivial ground states: an indicator of fractional Chern insulators
Authors: Nobuyuki Okuma, Tomonari Mizoguchi
Abstract: The search for candidate materials for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) has mainly focused on the topological and geometrical structures of single-particle Chern bands. However, there are inherent limitations in approaches that neglect interaction effects, highlighting the need for complementary methods. In this work, we discuss how the Chern number defined for the effective interaction projected onto a Chern band is related to the stabilization of FCIs. Specifically, by formulating both the effective interaction and the two-particle problem using a common matrix, we establish a connection between the two-particle band structure and the effective interaction. This formulation allows us to characterize the effective interaction through the topology of the two-particle band. To investigate the relationship between topological effective interactions and FCIs, we perform numerical calculations primarily based on exact diagonalization. We find a notable correlation between the fact that the dominant two-particle bands carry a unit Chern number and the realization of a robust FCI at the filling fraction $\nu = 1/3$. This result is consistent with the presumed correspondence between pseudopotentials in the fractional quantum Hall effect and the two-particle band structure. From another perspective, our findings suggest that the topology inherent in the interaction itself can obstruct trivial ground states. We also discuss this in the context of scattering channels. Extending such topological two-body interactions could pave the way for realizing exotic states beyond FCIs.

Title: High-Performance Ultra-Wide-Bandgap CaSnO3 Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors
Authors: Weideng Sun, Junghyun Koo, Donghwan Kim, Hongseung Lee, Rishi Raj, Chengyu Zhu, Kiyoung Lee, Andre Mkhoyan, Hagyoul Bae, Bharat Jalan, Gang Qiu
Abstract: The increasing demand for high-voltage and high-power electronic applications has intensified the search for novel ultrawide bandgap (UWB) semiconductors. Alkaline earth stannates possess wide band gaps and exhibit the highest room-temperature electron mobilities among all perovskite oxides. Among this family, Calcium stannate (CaSnO3) has the largest band gap of ~4.7 eV, holding great promise for high-power applications. However, the demonstration of CaSnO3 power electronic devices is so far limited. In this work, high-performance metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) devices based on La-doped CaSnO3 are demonstrated for the first time. The MOSFETs exhibit an on/off ratio exceeding 10^8, along with field-effect mobility of 8.4 cm2 V-1 s-1 and on-state current of 30 mA mm-1. The high performance of the CaSnO3 MOSFET devices can be ascribed to the excellent metal-to-semiconductor contact resistance of 0.73 k{\Omega}{\mu}m. The devices also show great potential for harsh environment operations, as high-temperature operations up to 400 K have been demonstrated. An off-state breakdown voltage of 1660 V is achieved, with a breakdown field of ~8.3 MV cm-1 among the highest reported for all UWB semiconductors. This work represents significant progress toward realizing the practical application of CaSnO3 in future high-voltage power electronic technologies.

Title: Enhancement of hydrogen absorption and hypervalent metal hydride formation in lanthanum using cryogenic ball milling

Abstract: Rare earth superhydrides exhibit high temperature superconductivity but are difficult to characterize and use in applications due to their high formation and stability pressures, which are typically in excess of 100 GPa. We studied how modification of the rare earth precursor improves hydrogen reactivity and hydrogen uptake for forming such metal hydrides at lower pressures. An elemental lanthanum precursor was milled at liquid nitrogen temperatures for different time intervals. After exposure to gaseous hydrogen at 380 C and 100 bar, we found a systematic enhancement of hydrogen absorption with increasing ball milling time for forming the LaHx, x=2-3 phase. Exposing the precursor to pressures up to 60 GPa with an ammonia borane (BNH6) hydrogen source resulted in a hypervalent LaH4 phase. This LaH4 phase is associated with the suppression of a rhombohedral distortion of the Fm3-m cubic structure after cryomilling the precursor.

Title: Half-metallicity and anomalous Slater-Pauling behaviour in half-Heusler CrMnSb
Authors: Himanshu Joshi, Shradhanjali Dewan, Lalrin Kima, Aldrin Lalremtluanga, Homnath Luitel, K. C. Bhamu, D.P. Rai
Abstract: This study provides a first-principles insight into half-Heusler CrMnSb to understand its deviation from the conventional Slater-Pauling semiconducting behavior. CrMnSb, having a valence electron count of 18, has been proposed to exhibit compensated ferrimagnetic character instead of the expected nonmagnetic semiconducting ground state. As half-Heusler systems with a valence electron count of 18 are not known to exhibit magnetic ordering, we have investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of CrMnSb using a combination of density functional theory and Green's function-based multiple-scattering theory. We show that, despite satisfying the 18 valence electron Slater-Pauling rule, CrMnSb does not exhibit ground-state nonmagnetic semiconducting behavior. Instead, it reveals a half-metallic, fully compensated ferrimagnetic ground state. This anomaly originates from the presence of localized sublattice moments, resulting from antiparallel alignment between Cr and Mn sublattices, which enforces half-metallic ferrimagnetism despite its ideal 18 valence electron count.

Title: Spatial QUBO: Convolutional Formulation of Large-Scale Binary Optimization with Dense Interactions
Authors: Hiroshi Yamashita, Hideyuki Suzuki
Abstract: The spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) is a promising optical hardware solver for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems with dense interactions. As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).

Title: Minimally dissipative multi-bit logical operations
Authors: Jérémie Klinger, Grant M. Rotskoff
Abstract: Modern computing architectures are vastly more energy-dissipative than fundamental thermodynamic limits suggest, motivating the search for principled approaches to low-dissipation logical operations. We formulate multi-bit logical gates (bit erasure, NAND) as optimal transport problems, extending beyond classical one-dimensional bit erasure to scenarios where existing methods fail. Using entropically regularized unbalanced optimal transport, we derive tractable solutions and establish general energy-speed-accuracy trade-offs that demonstrate that faster, more accurate operations necessarily dissipate more energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Landauer limits cannot be trivially overcome in higher dimensional geometries. We develop practical algorithms combining optimal transport with generative modeling techniques to construct dynamical controllers that follow Wasserstein geodesics. These protocols achieve near-optimal dissipation and can, in principle, be implemented in realistic experimentally set-ups. The framework bridges fundamental thermodynamic limits with scalable computational design for energy-efficient information processing.

Title: Coercivity Panorama of Dynamic Hysteresis
Authors: Miao Chen, Xiu-Hua Zhao, Yu-Han Ma
Abstract: We study the stochastic $\phi^4$ model under periodic driving by an external field $H$ at different scales of driving rate $v_H$, where the noise strength $\sigma$ quantifies the deviation of the system size from the thermodynamic limit. For large systems with small $\sigma$, we find the coercivity $H_c=H(\langle\phi\rangle=0)$ sequentially exhibits distinct behaviors with increasing $v_H$: $v_H$-scaling increase from zero, stable plateau ($v_H^0$), $v_H^{1/2}$-scaling increase, and abrupt decline to disappearance. The $H_c$-plateau reflects the competition between thermodynamic and quasi-static limits, namely, $\lim_{\sigma\to 0}\lim_{v_H\to 0}H_c = 0$, and $\lim_{v_H\to 0}\lim_{\sigma\to 0}H_c=H^*$. Here, $H^*$ is exactly the first-order phase transition (FOPT) point. In the post-plateau slow-driving regime, $H_c-H^*$ scales with $v_H^{2/3}$. Moreover, we reveal a finite-size scaling for the coercivity plateau $H_P$ as $(H^*-H_P)\sim\sigma^{4/3}$ by utilizing renormalization-group theory. These predicted scaling relations are demonstrated in magnetic hysteresis obtained with the Curie-Weiss model. Our work provides a panoramic view of the finite-time evolution of the stochastic $\phi^4$ model, bridges dynamics of FOPT and dynamic phase transition, and offers new insights into finite-time/finite-size effect interplay in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

Title: Combine effect of site dilution and long-range interaction on magnetic and transport properties in the half-filled Hubbard model
Authors: Sudip Mandal, Sourav Chakraborty, Kalpataru Pradhan
Abstract: We investigate the magnetotransport properties of a diluted half-filled one-band Hubbard model with second-nearest-neighbor hopping on a simple cubic lattice, aiming to explore the possibility of metallicity in diluted antiferromagnetic systems. Our semiclassical Monte Carlo (s-MC) calculations reveal an antiferromagnetic metallic regime in diluted correlated materials. This unexpected metallic regime naturally leads to a central question: how does the introduction of dilution into an antiferromagnetic material, especially with long-range magnetic interactions, induce metallicity -- a feature not commonly associated with antiferromagnets? To address this question, we demonstrate that when the on-site repulsion strength ($U$) is set to zero on a percentage of the sites (site dilution), the insulating state weakens due to percolative conduction among the diluted sites at low temperatures. Remarkably, this occurs without any significant alteration to the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering in the system, thereby providing a pathway to realize antiferromagnetic metals. In addition, we show how the sublattice-dependent hopping can be exploited to engineer spin-polarized half-metallic antiferromagnets. Overall, our numerical results collectively provide a basis for understanding the combined effect of site dilution and competing interactions, which will assist in the design of new antiferromagnetic metals for future spintronic applications.

Title: Dynamical Heterogeneity in Supercooled Water and its Spectroscopic Fingerprints
Authors: Cesare Malosso, Edward Danquah Donkor, Stefano Baroni, Ali Hassanali
Abstract: A growing body of theoretical and experimental evidence strongly supports the existence of a second liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in deeply supercooled water leading to the co-existence of two phases: a high-and low-density liquid (HDL and LDL). While the thermodynamics associated with this putative LLCP has been well characterised through numerical simulations, the dynamical properties of these two phases close to the critical point remain much less understood. In this work, we investigate their dynamical and spectroscopic features using machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Dynamical analyses using the van-Hove correlation function, reveal that LDL exhibits very sluggish and heterogeneous molecular mobility, in contrast to the faster and more homogeneous dynamics of HDL. Infrared absorption (IR) spectra further show clear vibrational distinctions between LDL and HDL, in particular in the far IR region between 400 - 1000 cm-1. Together, these findings provide new dynamical fingerprints that clarify the microscopic behavior of supercooled water and offer valuable guidance for experimental efforts aimed at detecting the long-sought liquid-liquid transition.

Title: DNA Unzipping Transition
Authors: Somendra M. Bhattacharjee
Abstract: This review focuses on the force-induced unzipping transition of double-stranded DNA. It begins with a brief history of DNA melting, which emerged alongside the growth of the field of molecular biology, juxtaposed with the advancements in physics during the same post-World War II period. The earlier theories of melting of DNA were based on the Ising model and its modifications, but gradually moved towards polymer-based models. The idea of force-induced unzipping was first introduced in 1999 as a cooperative mechanism for breaking base pairs without the need for temperature changes. The paper discusses several subsequent developments addressing different aspects of the unzipping transition.

Title: Dissipation Pathways in a Photosynthetic Complex
Authors: Ignacio Gustin, Chang Woo Kim, Ignacio Franco
Abstract: Determining how energy flows within and between molecules is crucial for understanding chemical reactions, material properties, and even vital processes such as photosynthesis. While the general principles of energy transfer are well established, elucidating the specific molecular pathways by which energy is funneled remains challenging as it requires tracking energy flow in complex molecular environments. Here, we demonstrate how photon excitation energy is partially dissipated in the light-harvesting Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, mediating the excitation energy transfer from light-harvesting chlorosomes to the photosynthetic reaction center in green sulfur bacteria. Specifically, we isolate the contribution of the protein and specific vibrational modes of the pigment molecules to the energy dynamics. For this, we introduce an efficient computational implementation of a recently proposed theory of dissipation pathways for open quantum systems. Using it and a state-of-the-art FMO model with highly structured and chromophore-specific spectral densities, we demonstrate that energy dissipation is dominated by low-frequency modes ($<$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) as their energy range is near-resonance with the energy gaps between electronic states of the pigments. We identify the most important mode for dissipation to be in-plane breathing modes ($\sim$200 cm$^{-1}$) of the bacteriochlorophylls in the complex. Conversely, far-detuned intramolecular vibrations with higher frequencies ($>$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) play no role in dissipation. Interestingly, the FMO complex first needs to borrow energy from the environment to release excess photonic energy, making the energy dissipation dynamics non-monotonic. Beyond their fundamental value, these insights can guide the development of artificial light-harvesting devices and, more broadly, engineer environments for chemical and quantum control tasks.

Title: Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of diffusive U(1)-invariant qubit circuits
Authors: Urban Duh, Marko Žnidarič
Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of translationally invariant magnetization-conserving qubit circuits via the spectrum of the quasi-momentum-resolved truncated propagator of extensive observables. Diffusive transport of the conserved magnetization is reflected in the Gaussian quasi-momentum $k$ dependence of the leading eigenvalue (Ruelle-Pollicott resonance) of the truncated propagator for small $k$. This, in particular, allows us to extract the diffusion constant. For large $k$, the leading Ruelle-Pollicott resonance is not related to transport and governs the exponential decay of correlation functions. Additionally, we conjecture the existence of a continuum of eigenvalues below the leading diffusive resonance, which governs non-exponential decay, for instance, power-law hydrodynamic tails. We expect our conclusions to hold for generic systems with exactly one U(1) conserved quantity.

Title: Nonlinear Symmetry-Fragmentation of Nonabelian Anyons In Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases: A String-Net Model Realization
Authors: Nianrui Fu, Siyuan Wang, Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan
Abstract: Symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases combine intrinsic topological order with global symmetries, giving rise to novel symmetry phenomena. While SET phases with Abelian anyons are relatively well understood, those involving non-Abelian anyons remain elusive. This obscurity stems from the multi-dimensional internal gauge spaces intrinsic to non-Abelian anyons -- a feature first made explicit in [1,2] and further explored and formalized in our recent works [3-8]. These internal spaces can transform in highly nontrivial ways under global symmetries. In this work, we employ an exactly solvable model -- the multifusion Hu-Geer-Wu string-net model introduced in a companion paper [9] -- to reveal how the internal gauge spaces of non-Abelian anyons transform under symmetries. We uncover a universal mechanism, global symmetry fragmentation (GSF), whereby symmetry-invariant anyons exhibit internal Hilbert space decompositions into eigensubspaces labeled by generally fractional symmetry charges. Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment their internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These fragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations -- to be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and projective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in topological phases. Our results identify nonlinear fragmentation as a hallmark of non-Abelian SETs and suggest new routes for symmetry-enabled control in topological quantum computation.

Title: Approximate half-integer quantization in anomalous planar transport in $d$-wave altermagnets
Authors: Srimayi Korrapati, Snehasish Nandy, Sumanta Tewari
Abstract: We investigate anomalous planar transport phenomena in a recently identified class of collinear magnetic materials known as $d$-wave altermagnets. The anomalous planar effects manifest in a configuration when the applied electric field/temperature gradient, magnetic field, and the measured Hall voltage are all co-planar, but the planar magnetic field is instrumental in breaking $\hat{C}_{4z}\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ symmetry of the $d$-wave altermagnet, where $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ is the time reversal operator, resulting in a Zeeman gap at a shifted Dirac node and a nonzero Berry curvature monopole. We demonstrate that these systems exhibit nearly half-quantized anomalous planar Hall and planar thermal Hall effects at low temperatures that persist over a range of magnetic fields. The angular dependence of the planar transport reveals a $\cos2\phi$ dependence on the magnetic field direction, where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle made by the magnetic field. We also discuss the anomalous planar Nernst effect, or transverse thermopower, and demonstrate that the Nernst conductivity peaks when the chemical potential lies just outside the induced Zeeman gap and vanishes within the gap. We further explore the dependence of all three coefficients on the polar and the azimuthal angle of the magnetic field when it is rotated in the full $3D$ space. Our results reveal the presence of approximately half-quantized anomalous planar thermal Hall plateau for a range of in-plane magnetic fields without requiring topological superconductivity and conducting Majorana modes, and can be probed in experiments in $d$-wave altermagnets.

Title: Piezoelectric truss metamaterials: data-driven design and additive manufacturing
Authors: Saurav Sharma, Satya K. Ammu, Prakash Thakolkaran, Jovana Jovanova, Kunal Masania, Siddhant Kumar
Abstract: In the development of active animate materials, electromechanical coupling is highly attractive to realize mechanoresponsive functionality. Piezoelectricity is the most utilized electromechanical phenomenon due to the wide availability of materials that display precise and reliable coupling. However, the inherent directionality of these materials is constrained by the symmetry of their crystal structure, which limits the choice of available properties in natural piezoelectric materials. A solution to alleviate this limitation could be to leverage geometry or architecture at the mesoscale. Here, we present an integrated framework to design and 3D-print piezoelectric truss metamaterials with customizable anisotropic responses. To explore the vast design space of truss metamaterials, we employ generative machine learning to optimize the topology and geometry of truss lattices and achieve target piezoelectricity. Then, we develop an in-gel-3D printing method to fabricate polymer-ceramic piezoelectric truss metamaterial structures using a composite slurry of photo-curable resin and lead-free piezoelectric particles. The ML framework discovers designs exhibiting unconventional behaviors, including auxetic, unidirectional, and omnidirectional piezoelectricity, while the additive manufacturing technique ensures shaping freedom and precision in fabricating these metamaterials at small scales. Our results show an improvement of over 48% in the specific hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficient in optimized metamaterials over bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT). We successfully achieved metamaterials with higher transverse piezoelectric coupling coefficient than its longitudinal coefficient, which is a phenomenon that is rare in bulk materials. Our approach enables customizable piezoelectric responses and paves the way towards the development of a new generation of electro-active animate materials.

Title: Enhanced Mesenchymal Stem Cell Response with Preserved Biocompatibility via (MnZn)Ferrite--Polyacrylonitrile Composite Nanofiber Membranes
Authors: Baran Sarac, Elham Sharifikolouei, Matej Micusik, Alessandro Scalia, Ziba Najmi, Andrea Cochis, Lia Rimondini, Gabriele Barrera, Marco Coisson, Selin Gümrükcü, Eray Yüce, A. Sezai Sarac
Abstract: This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of advanced polymeric composite electrospun nanofibers (NFs) containing magnetic oxide nanoparticles (NPs). By leveraging the method of electrospinning, the research aims to investigate polymer composites with enhanced interfacial properties, improved double-layer capacitance, and adequate biocompatibility. Electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) NFs embedded with Fe2O3 and MnZn ferrite NPs were comprehensively characterized using advanced techniques, i.e., Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and alternating gradient field magnetometry (AGFM). The incorporation of metal oxide NPs led to significant changes in the thermal, spectroscopic, and morphological properties of the NFs. XPS analysis confirmed increased oxidation, graphitic carbon content, and the formation of new nitrogen functionalities after heat treatment. Furthermore, interactions between nitrile groups and metal ions were observed, indicating the influence of nanoparticles on surface chemistry. Magnetic characterization demonstrated the potential of these composite NFs to generate magnetic fields for biomedical manipulation. Cytocompatibility studies revealed no significant impact on the viability or morphology of human mesenchymal stromal cells, highlighting their biocompatibility. These findings suggest the promising use of PAN-magnetic NFs in applications including targeted drug administration, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic hyperthermia for cancer treatment.

Title: Neural models of multiscale systems: conceptual limitations, stochastic parametrizations, and a climate application
Authors: Fabrizio Falasca
Abstract: This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case, the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper} variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere, assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and interpretability.

Title: Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states
Authors: Madhumita Rano, Henrik R. Larsson
Abstract: Excited eigenstates are crucial to understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. Tensor network states are one of the workhorses to compute ground states of many-body systems, yet the accurate computation of excited eigenstates is still challenging. Here, we develop a combination of the inexact Lanczos method, which aims at efficiently computing excited states, to tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 84 states in different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional), and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.

Title: A scanning resonator for probing quantum coherent devices
Authors: Jared Gibson, Zhanzhi Jiang, Angela Kou
Abstract: Superconducting resonators with high quality factors are extremely sensitive detectors of the complex impedance of materials and devices coupled to them. This capability has been used to measure losses in multiple different materials and, in the case of circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED), has been used to measure the coherent evolution of multiple different types of qubits. Here, we report on the implementation of a scanning resonator for probing quantum coherent devices. Our scanning setup enables tunable coherent coupling to systems of interest without the need for fabricating on-chip superconducting resonators. We measure the internal quality factor of our resonator sensor in the single-photon regime to be > 10000 and demonstrate capacitive imaging using our sensor with zeptoFarad sensitivity and micron spatial resolution at milliKelvin temperatures. We then use our setup to characterize the energy spectrum and coherence times of multiple transmon qubits with no on-chip readout circuitry. Our work introduces a new tool for using circuit QED to measure existing and proposed qubit platforms.

Title: Ultra-High-Temperature Vacuum Prober for Electrical and Thermal Measurements
Authors: Laurent Jalabert, Jose Ordonez-Miranda, Yunhui Wu, Byunggi Kim, Roman Anufriev, Masahiro Nomura, Sebastian Volz
Abstract: We develop an ultra-high-temperature vacuum probe station (UHT-VPS) featuring a sample holder heated by thermal radiation from a silicon carbide heater. This contactless configuration electrically isolates the sample from the high-power heating source through a vacuum gap, ensuring reliable measurements under extreme conditions. The capability of this UHT-VPS to measure electrical signals from 30 nV upward on bulk sapphire is demonstrated using the 3w/2w method. Measurements are continuously operated from 300 to 1150 K, under high vacuum, for a total of about 66 hours without readjusting the contact. They yield the linear and quadratic temperature coefficients of resistance of chromium/platinum micro-resistances, as well as the sapphire's thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity. By recording the heater and sensor temperature signals up to 30 kHz and fitting them with theoretical models that account for the quadratic TCR of Cr/Pt microwires, we obtain values in agreement with literature data obtained by optical methods. In this temperature range, we also measure thermal conductivity, which cannot be directly accessed by optical techniques. Our system thus provides an effective solution for simultaneously retrieving the electrical and thermal properties of materials using a single set of 3w/2w data up to unprecedented temperature levels.

Title: Scaling Laws of Quantum Information Lifetime in Monitored Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Bingzhi Zhang, Fangjun Hu, Runzhe Mo, Tianyang Chen, Hakan E. Türeci, Quntao Zhuang
Abstract: Quantum information is typically fragile under measurement and environmental coupling. Remarkably, we find that its lifetime can scale exponentially with system size when the environment is continuously monitored via mid-circuit measurements -- regardless of bath size. Starting from a maximally entangled state with a reference, we analytically prove this exponential scaling for typical Haar random unitaries and confirm it through numerical simulations in both Haar-random and chaotic Hamiltonian systems. In the absence of bath monitoring, the lifetime exhibits a markedly different scaling: it grows at most linearly -- or remains constant -- with system size and decays inversely with bath size. We further extend our findings numerically to a broad class of initial states. We discuss implications for monitored quantum circuits in the weak measurement limit, quantum algorithms such as quantum diffusion models and quantum reservoir computing, and quantum communication. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of resolving the predicted scaling regimes experimentally via noisy simulations of IBM Quantum hardwares.

Title: Chiral superfluorescence from perovskite superlattices
Authors: Qi Wei, Jonah S. Peter, Hui Ren, Weizhen Wang, Luwei Zhou, Qi Liu, Stefan Ostermann, Jun Yin, Songhua Cai, Susanne F. Yelin, Mingjie Li
Abstract: Superfluorescence (SF), a many-body quantum optics phenomenon, emerges from the collective interactions among self-organized and cooperatively coupled emitters, producing intense burst of ultrashort coherent radiation1-4. While SF has been observed in several solid-state materials5-9, the spontaneous generation of circularly polarized (CP) chiral SF has not been realized. Here, we report room-temperature chiral CP-SF originating from edge states in large-area (>100 um * 100 um), transferable vertically aligned chiral quasi-2D perovskite superlattices. Theoretical quantum optics calculations reveal that chirality-induced photon transport drives the transition from initially incoherent, weakly polarized spontaneous emission to highly polarized CP-SF, amplifying the circular polarization degree up to around 14%. Notably, the polarization helicity is found to flip between forward and backward propagation directions, a characteristic signature of a macroscopic CP dipole transition. Moreover, both the intensity and polarization degree of CP-SF can be tuned under weak magnetic fields, enabling precise control over solid-state quantum light emission at room temperature. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of chirality in establishing large-scale quantum coherence within chiral superlattices, thereby unveiling promising avenues for chirality-controlled quantum spin-optical applications 10,11.

Title: Terahertz source-on-a-chip with decade-long stability using layered superconductor elliptical microcavities
Authors: Mingqi Zhang, Shungo Nakagawa, Yuki Enomoto, Yoshihiko Kuzumi, Ryuta Kikuchi, Yuki Yamauchi, Toshiaki Hattori, Richard A. Klemm, Kazuo Kadowaki, Takanari Kashiwagi, Kaveh Delfanazari
Abstract: Coherent, continuous-wave, and electrically tunable chip-scale terahertz (THz) sources are critical for emerging applications in sensing, imaging, spectroscopy, communication, space and quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust source-on-a-chip THz emitter based on a layered high-temperature superconductor, engineered with an elliptical microcavity and capable of sustained coherent emission over an unprecedented operational lifetime exceeding 11 years. This compact THz source operates up to 60 K, with Tc= 90 K, delivering stable radiation in the 0.7-0.8 THz range, with on-chip electrical tunability from 100 GHz to 1 THz. Coherence arises from the phase-locked oscillation of intrinsic Josephson junction arrays, resonantly coupled to transverse electromagnetic modes within the cavity, analogous to a laser cavity, yielding collective macroscopic oscillations. THz emission remains detectable across a 0.5 m free-space open-air link at room temperature. We analyse the cavity-mode structure and extract THz photon generation rates up to 503 photons fs-1 in cryogenic conditions and 50-260 photons ps-1 over-the-air. These results establish long-term coherent THz emission from superconductors and chart a viable path toward scalable, tunable, solid-state coherent THz laser-on-a-chip platforms, especially for future classical and quantum systems.

Title: Grazing incidence X-ray scattering alignment using the area detector
Authors: Edward Tortorici, Charles T. Rogers
Abstract: Grazing incidence X-ray scattering experiments are designed to achieve strong scattering signals from materials, such as molecular monolayers, island films, or thin films that are localized to the surfaces of flat substrates. Optimal signals can be achieved with precise alignment of a substrate surface with the X-ray beam. Here, we outline a simple method that utilizes the area detector, generally available on such systems, to observe reflections from the sample to determine the sample-detector distance and the motor positions corresponding to the film being parallel to and centered in the beam. Observations of the reflected and transmitted beams are used to determine the critical angle of the sample and inform ideal motor angles that will lead to scattered X-ray intensity enhancement.

Title: Insights into Ionic Diffusion in C-S-H Gel Pore from MD Simulations: Spatial Distributions, Energy Barriers, and Structural Descriptor
Authors: Weiqiang Chen, Kai Gong
Abstract: Understanding transport behavior in nanoconfined environments is critical to many natural and engineering systems, including cementitious materials, yet its molecular-level mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate Na+, Cl-, and water diffusion inside a 4 nm calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) pore channel over temperatures ranging from 300 K to 360 K. Spatially resolved analysis revealed strong suppression of diffusivity near the solid-liquid interface and gradual recovery toward the pore center. Arrhenius analysis further quantified the spatial variation of activation energy barriers and intrinsic mobilities across the pore channel, showing distinct confinement effects. The spatially resolved structural analysis uncovers a mechanistic transition from structure-controlled to hydrodynamics-controlled transport regimes with increasing distance from the pore surface. A structural descriptor, total coordination strength (TCS), was introduced, providing a predictive link between local liquid structure and molecular mobility within approximately 1 nm of the interface. Beyond 1 nm, suppressed diffusivities were well captured by an exponential decay model based on the Darcy-Brinkman framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MD study to comprehensively resolve the spatial heterogeneity of transport, thermal kinetics, and structure within cementitious nanopores. These findings deepen the fundamental understanding of nanoscale transport phenomena and suggest that tailoring the nanochannel structure and interfacial chemistry of cementitious gels, such as surface coordination environments, pore size distributions, and adsorption sites, may offer a promising strategy to suppress ionic ingress and enhance the durability of cement-based materials.

Title: Homomorphism, substructure and ideal: Elementary but rigorous aspects of renormalization group or hierarchical structure of topological orders
Authors: Yoshiki Fukusumi, Yuma Furuta
Abstract: We study ring homomorphisms between fusion rings appearing in conformal field theories connected under massless renormalization group (RG) flows. By interpreting the elementary relationship between homomorphism, quotient ring, and projection, we propose a general quantum Hamiltonian formalism of a massless and massive RG flow with an emphasis on generalized symmetry. In our formalism, the noninvertible nature of the ideal of a fusion ring plays a fundamental role as a condensation rule between anyons. Our algebraic method applies to the domain wall problem in $2+1$ dimensional topologically ordered systems and the corresponding classification of $1+1$ dimensional gapped phase, for example. An ideal decomposition of a fusion ring provides a straightforward but strong constraint on the gapped phase with noninvertible symmetry and its symmetry-breaking (or emergent symmetry) patterns. Moreover, even in several specific homomorphisms connected under massless RG flows, less familiar homomorphisms appear, and we conjecture that they correspond to partially solvable models in recent literature. Our work demonstrates the fundamental significance of the abstract algebraic structure, ideal, for the RG in physics.

Title: On Boltzmann Averaging in Ab Initio Thermodynamics
Authors: Hendrik H. Heenen, Karsten Reuter
Abstract: Ab initio thermodynamics is a widespread, computationally efficient approach to predict the stable configuration of a surface in contact with a surrounding (gas or liquid) environment. In a prevalent realization of this approach, this stable configuration is simply equated with the structure in a considered candidate pool that exhibits the lowest surface free energy. Here we discuss the possibility to consider the thermal accessibility of competing, higher-energy configurations through Boltzmann averaging when the extended surface configurations and their energetics are computed within periodic boundary condition supercells. We show analytically that fully converged averages can be obtained with a candidate pool derived from exhaustive sampling in a surface unit-cell exceeding the system's correlation length. In contrast, averaging over a small pool of ad hoc assembled structures is generally ill-defined. Enumerations of a lattice-gas Hamiltonian model for on-surface oxygen adsorption at Pd(100) are employed to illustrate these considerations in a practical context.

Title: Thermodynamic ranking of pathways in reaction networks
Authors: Praful Gagrani, Nino Lauber, Eric Smith, Christoph Flamm
Abstract: Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems due to their compositionality, which makes them well-suited for analyzing interactions of subsystems within larger aggregate systems. This work presents a thermodynamic formalism for ranking CRN pathways under fixed throughput currents (fixed velocities of species flowing in and out of the system), where pathways represent subnetworks capable of performing the stipulated chemical conversion. We define a thermodynamic cost function for pathways derived from the large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), and a restriction cost, quantifying the ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway. Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response regime, we prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded below by those of their hosting network. Extending the analysis far from equilibrium, we find that while cost is non-decreasing for progressively more restricted nested pathways near equilibrium, multimolecular CRN examples can be found that assign lower costs to more restricted pathways at far-from-equilibrium NESSs. The possibility to reduce the resistance of a network at fixed throughput, while also simplifying the network, may have implications for enzyme family evolution, in which novel reaction mechanisms may first lead to a proliferation of pathways through non-specific catalysis, but later selection for specificity may benefit both from species retention, and more efficient use of autocatalysts to improve throughput.

Title: Photonic Altermagnets: Magnetic Symmetries in Photonic Structures
Authors: Andrew Sungwook Kim, Youqiang Huang, Zhipei Sun, Q-Han Park, Hyunyong Choi
Abstract: The unique physical properties of altermagnets, when transplanted to photonic systems, are anticipated to offer a new degree of freedom for engineering electromagnetic waves. Here, we show that a photonic analogue of altermagnetism can be mimicked in photonic crystals, where engineered photonic crystals can host spin space group symmetries. Our approach allows for the creation of spin-split bands and the corresponding transport properties provide an effective platform for circularly polarized light isolation without the need of geometrodynamic spin-orbit interaction. Beyond the concurrent solid-state materials, we anticipate our work to offer photonic crystals as a versatile platform to test the spin-split band properties and inspire optical designs for photospintronic applications.

Title: Neural Langevin Machine: a local asymmetric learning rule can be creative
Authors: Zhendong Yu, Weizhong Huang, Haiping Huang
Abstract: Fixed points of recurrent neural networks can be leveraged to store and generate information. These fixed points can be captured by the Boltzmann-Gibbs measure, which leads to neural Langevin dynamics that can be used for sampling and learning a real dataset. We call this type of generative model neural Langevin machine, which is interpretable due to its analytic form of distribution and is simple to train. Moreover, the learning process is derived as a local asymmetric plasticity rule, bearing biological relevance. Therefore, one can realize a continuous sampling of creative dynamics in a neural network, mimicking an imagination process in brain circuits. This neural Langevin machine may be another promising generative model, at least in its strength in circuit-based sampling and biologically plausible learning rule.

Title: Optimal observables for (non-)equilibrium quantum metrology from the master equation
Authors: Víctor López-Pardo, Alexander Rothkopf
Abstract: We demonstrate how observables with optimal sensitivity to environmental properties can be constructed explicitly from the master equation of an open-quantum system. Our approach does not rely on the explicit solution of the master equation. This makes the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD), the operator of optimal sensitivity and key quantity in quantum metrology, available to a large class of systems of interest, both in and out-of-equilibrium. We validate our approach by reproducing the SLD for temperature in quantum Brownian motion and demonstrate its versatility by constructing the optimal observable for the non-equilibrium relaxation rate.

Title: Diffusion in the Inverted Triangular Soft Lorentz Gas
Authors: Esko Toivonen, Aleksi Majaniemi, Rainer Klages, Esa Räsänen
Abstract: We investigate diffusion in a two-dimensional inverted soft Lorentz gas, where attractive Fermi-type potential wells are arranged in a triangular lattice. This configuration contrasts with earlier studies of soft Lorentz gases involving repulsive scatterers. By systematically varying the gap width and softness of the potential, we explore a rich landscape of diffusive behaviors. We present numerical simulations of the mean squared displacement and compute diffusion coefficients, identifying tongue-like structures in parameter space associated with quasiballistic transport. Furthermore, we develop an extension to the Machta-Zwanzig approximation that incorporates correlated multi-hop trajectories and correct for the influence of localized periodic orbits. Our findings highlight the qualitative and quantitative differences between inverted and repulsive soft Lorentz gases and offer new insights into transport phenomena in smooth periodic potentials.

Title: Interferometric and Bipartite OTOC for Non-Markovian Open Quantum Spin-Chains and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model
Authors: Baibhab Bose, Devvrat Tiwari, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: The information scrambling phenomena in an open quantum system modeled by Ising spin chains coupled to Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) baths are observed via an interferometric method for obtaining out-of-time-ordered correlators ($\mathcal{F}-$OTOC). We also use an anisotropic bath connecting to a system of tilted field Ising spin chain in order to confirm that such situations are suitable for the emergence of ballistic spreading of information manifested in the light cones in the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC profiles. Bipartite OTOC is also calculated for a bipartite open system, and its behavior is compared with that of the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC of a two-spin open system to get a picture of what these measures reveal about the nature of scrambling in different parameter regimes. Additionally, the presence of distinct phases in the LMG model motivated an independent analysis of its scrambling properties, where $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC diagnostics revealed that quantum chaos emerges exclusively in the symmetry-broken phase.

Title: Sociophysics models inspired by the Ising model
Authors: Pratik Mullick, Parongama Sen
Abstract: The Ising model, originally developed for understanding magnetic phase transitions, has become a cornerstone in the study of collective phenomena across diverse disciplines. In this review, we explore how Ising and Ising-like models have been successfully adapted to sociophysical systems, where binary-state agents mimic human decisions or opinions. By focusing on key areas such as opinion dynamics, financial markets, social segregation, game theory, language evolution, and epidemic spreading, we demonstrate how the models describing these phenomena, inspired by the Ising model, capture essential features of collective behavior, including phase transitions, consensus formation, criticality, and metastability. In particular, we emphasize the role of the dynamical rules of evolution in the different models that often converge back to Ising-like universality. We end by outlining the future directions in sociphysics research, highlighting the continued relevance of the Ising model in the analysis of complex social systems.

Title: Vortex Detection from Quantum Data
Authors: Chelsea A. Williams, Annie E. Paine, Antonio A. Gentile, Daniel Berger, Oleksandr Kyriienko
Abstract: Quantum solutions to differential equations represent quantum data -- states that contain relevant information about the system's behavior, yet are difficult to analyze. We propose a toolbox for reading out information from such data, where customized quantum circuits enable efficient extraction of flow properties. We concentrate on the process referred to as quantum vortex detection (QVD), where specialized operators are developed for pooling relevant features related to vorticity. Specifically, we propose approaches based on sliding windows and quantum Fourier analysis that provide a separation between patches of the flow field with vortex-type profiles. First, we show how contour-shaped windows can be applied, trained, and analyzed sequentially, providing a clear signal to flag the location of vortices in the flow. Second, we develop a parallel window extraction technique, such that signals from different contour positions are coherently processed to avoid looping over the entire solution mesh. We show that Fourier features can be extracted from the flow field, leading to classification of datasets with vortex-free solutions against those exhibiting Lamb-Oseen vortices. Our work exemplifies a successful case of efficiently extracting value from quantum data and points to the need for developing appropriate quantum data analysis tools that can be trained on them.

Title: Deconstructing the Origins of Interfacial Catalysis: Why Electric Fields are Inseparable from Solvation
Authors: Solana Di Pino, Debarshi Banerjee, Marta Monti, Gonzalo Diaz Miron, Giuseppe Cassone, Ali Hassanali
Abstract: In the last decade, there has been a surge of experiments showing that certain chemical reactions undergo an enormous boost when taken from bulk aqueous conditions to microdroplet environments. The microscopic basis of this phenomenon remains elusive and continues to be widely debated. One of the key driving forces invoked are the specific properties of the air-water interface including the presence of large electric fields and distinct solvation at the surface. Here, using a combination of classical molecular dynamics simulations, the chemical physics of solvation, and unsupervised learning approaches, we place these assumptions under close scrutiny. Using phenol as a model system, we demonstrate that the electric field at the surface of water is not anomalous or unique compared to bulk water conditions. Furthermore, the electric field fluctuations de-correlate on a timescale of ~10 ps implying that their role in activating much slower chemical reactions remains inconclusive. We deploy a recently developed unsupervised learning approach, dubbed information balance, which detects in an agnostic fashion the relationship between the electric field and solvation collective variables. It turns out that the electric field on the hydroxyl group of the phenol is mostly determined by phenol hydration including the proximity and orientation of nearby water molecules. We caution that the growing attention of the role that electric fields have garnered in enhancing chemical reactivity at the air-water interface, may not reflect their actual importance.

Title: Maximum entropy principle for quantum processes
Authors: Siddhartha Das, Ujjwal Sen
Abstract: The maximum entropy principle states that the maximum entropy among all quantum states with a fixed mean energy is achieved only by the thermal state of given mean energy. In this notes, we prove the maximum entropy principle for quantum processes -- the entropy of a quantum channel with fixed mean energy is maximum if and only if the channel is absolutely thermalizing channel with the fixed output thermal state of that mean energy. This allows for an alternate approach to describe emergence of the absolute thermalization processes under energy constraints in the observable universe.

Title: Quantum channel for modeling spin-motion dephasing in Rydberg chains
Authors: Christopher Wyenberg, Kent Ueno, Alexandre Cooper
Abstract: We introduce a quantum channel to model the dissipative dynamics resulting from the coupling between spin and motional degrees of freedom in chains of neutral atoms with Rydberg interactions. The quantum channel acts on the reduced spin state obtained under the frozen gas approximation, modulating its elements with time-dependent coefficients. These coefficients can be computed exactly in the perturbative regime, enabling efficient modeling of spin-motion dephasing in systems too large for exact methods. We benchmark the accuracy of our approach against exact diagonalization for small systems, identifying its regime of validity and the onset of perturbative breakdown. We then apply the quantum channel to compute fidelity loss during transport of single-spin excitations across extended Rydberg chains in regimes intractable via exact diagonalization. By revealing the quantum-classical crossover, these results establish a bound on the maximum chain length for efficient entanglement distribution. The quantum channel significantly reduces the complexity of simulating spin dynamics coupled to motional degrees of freedom, providing a practical tool for estimating the impact of spin-motion coupling in near-term experiments with Rydberg atom arrays.

Title: Topological Holography: Towards a Unification of Landau and Beyond-Landau Physics
Authors: Heidar Moradi, Seyed Faroogh Moosavian, Apoorv Tiwari
Abstract: We outline a holographic framework that attempts to unify Landau and beyond-Landau paradigms of quantum phases and phase transitions. Leveraging a modern understanding of symmetries as topological defects/operators, the framework uses a topological order to organize the space of quantum systems with a global symmetry in one lower dimension. The global symmetry naturally serves as an input for the topological order. In particular, we holographically construct a String Operator Algebra (SOA) which is the building block of symmetric quantum systems with a given symmetry $G$ in one lower dimension. This exposes a vast web of dualities which act on the space of $G$-symmetric quantum systems. The SOA facilitates the classification of gapped phases as well as their corresponding order parameters and fundamental excitations, while dualities help to navigate and predict various corners of phase diagrams and analytically compute universality classes of phase transitions. A novelty of the approach is that it treats conventional Landau and unconventional topological phase transitions on an equal footing, thereby providing a holographic unification of these seemingly-disparate domains of understanding. We uncover a new feature of gapped phases and their multi-critical points, which we dub fusion structure, that encodes information about which phases and transitions can be dual to each other. Furthermore, we discover that self-dual systems typically posses emergent non-invertible, i.e., beyond group-like symmetries. We apply these ideas to $1+1d$ quantum spin chains with finite Abelian group symmetry, using topologically-ordered systems in $2+1d$. We predict the phase diagrams of various concrete spin models, and analytically compute the full conformal spectra of non-trivial quantum phase transitions, which we then verify numerically.

Title: Scaling behaviors at quantum and classical first-order transitions
Authors: Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We consider quantum and classical first-order transitions, at equilibrium and under out-of-equilibrium conditions, mainly focusing on quench and slow quasi-adiabatic protocols. For these phenomena, we review the finite-size scaling theory appropriate to describe the general features of the large-scale, and long-time for dynamic phenomena, behavior of finite-size systems.

Title: Dynamical structure factor and a new method to measure the pairing gap in two-dimensional attractive Fermi-Hubbard model
Authors: Huaisong Zhao, Feng Yuan, Tianxing Ma, Peng Zou
Abstract: The measurement of the pairing gap plays an essential role in studying the physical properties of superconductors or superfluids. We develop a strategy for measure the pairing gap through the dynamical excitations. With the random phase approximation (RPA), the dynamical excitations of a two-dimensional attractive Fermi-Hubbard model are studied by calculating the dynamical structure factor. Two distinct collective modes are investigated: a Goldstone phonon mode at the transferred momentum ${\bf q}=\left[0,0\right]$ and a roton mode at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$. The roton mode demonstrates a sharp molecular peak in the low-energy regime. Remarkably, the area under the roton molecular peak scales with the square of the pairing gap, which persists even in three-dimensional and spin-orbit coupled (SOC) optical lattices. This result provides a potential strategy to measure the pairing gap of lattice systems experimentally by measuring the dynamical structure factor at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$.

Title: Incremental dynamics of prestressed viscoelastic solids and its applications in shear wave elastography
Authors: Yuxuan Jiang, Guo-Yang Li, Zhaoyi Zhang, Shiyu Ma, Yanping Cao, Seok-Hyun Yun
Abstract: Shear wave elastography (SWE) is a promising imaging modality for mechanical characterization of tissues, offering biomarkers with potential for early and precise diagnosis. While various methods have been developed to extract mechanical parameters from shear wave characteristics, their relationships in viscoelastic materials under prestress remain poorly understood. Here, we present a generalized incremental dynamics theory for finite-strain viscoelastic solids. The theory derives small-amplitude viscoelastic wave motions in a material under static pre-stress. The formalism is compatible with a range of existing constitutive models, including both hyperelasticity and viscoelasticity--such as the combination of Gasser-Ogden-Holzapfel (GOH) and Kelvin-Voigt fractional derivative (KVFD) models used in this study. We validate the theory through experiments and numerical simulations on prestressed soft materials and biological tissues, using both optical coherence elastography and ultrasound elastography. The theoretical predictions closely match experimental dispersion curves over a broad frequency range and accurately capture the effect of prestress. Furthermore, the framework reveals the relationships among shear wave phase velocity, attenuation, and principal stresses, enabling prestress quantification in viscoelastic solids without prior knowledge of constitutive parameters. This generalized acousto-viscoelastic formalism is particularly well-suited for high-frequency, high-resolution SWE in tissues under prestress.

Title: Ab initio modelling of quantum dot qubits: Coupling, gate dynamics and robustness versus charge noise
Authors: Hamza Jnane, Simon C Benjamin
Abstract: Electron spins in semiconductor devices are highly promising building blocks for quantum processors (QPs). Commercial semiconductor foundries can create QPs using the same processes employed for conventional chips, once the QP design is suitably specified. There is a vast accessible design space; to identify the most promising options for fabrication, one requires predictive modelling of interacting electrons in real geometries and complex non-ideal environments. In this work we explore a modelling method based on real-space grids, an ab initio approach without assumptions relating to device topology and therefore with wide applicability. Given an electrode geometry, we determine the exchange coupling between quantum dot qubits, and model the full evolution of a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate to predict qubit loss and infidelity rates for various voltage profiles. We determine full, 3D solutions and introduce a method which can obtain near-identical predictions using far more efficient 2D computations. Moreover we explore the impact of unwanted charge defects (static and dynamic) in the environment, and test robust pulse sequences. As an example we exhibit a sequence correcting both systematic errors and (unknown) charge defects, observing an order of magnitude boost in fidelity. The technique can thus identify the most promising device designs for fabrication, as well as bespoke control sequences for each such device.

Title: Anomalous enhancement of carrier mobility by remote phonons
Authors: Chenmu Zhang, Yuanyue Liu
Abstract: Remote phonons from dielectrics are typically believed to degrade carrier mobility in adjacent semiconductors through Fröhlich scattering of polar-optical phonons (POPs). Here, we challenge this conventional view by demonstrating that in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, remote POPs can instead enhance the mobility. To this end, we developed a first-principles computational framework to evaluate these remote phonon effects. Applying our approach to an example of monolayer InSe semiconductor encapsulated by h-BN dielectric layers, we show that electron mobility is enhanced due to coupling between POPs in InSe and h-BN, which gives rise to a new collective phonon mode where their individual Fröhlich potentials partially cancel each other. Based on this insight, we further identified additional dielectrics that display similar mobility enhancement, demonstrating universality of mobility enhancement due to remote phonons. This work offers not only an effective computational method to evaluate the remote phonon effects but also new insights into mobility engineering in next-generation electronics.

Title: Non-equilibrium structure and relaxation in active microemulsions
Authors: Rakesh Chatterjee, Hui-Shun Kuan, Frank Julicher, Vasily Zaburdaev
Abstract: Microphase separation is common in active biological systems as exemplified by the separation of RNA and DNA-rich phases in the cell nucleus driven by the transcriptional activity of polymerase enzymes acting similarly to amphiphiles in a microemulsion. Here we propose an analytically tractable model of an active microemulsion to investigate how the activity affects its structure and relaxation dynamics. Continuum theory derived from a lattice model exhibits two distinct regimes of the relaxation dynamics and is linked to the broken detailed balance due to intermittent activity of the amphiphiles.

Title: Collapse of a quantum vortex in an attractive two-dimensional Bose gas
Authors: Sambit Banerjee, Kai Zhou, Shiva Kant Tiwari, Hikaru Tamura, Rongjie Li, Panayotis Kevrekidis, Simeon I. Mistakidis, Valentin Walther, Chen-Lung Hung
Abstract: We experimentally and numerically study the collapse dynamics of a quantum vortex in a two-dimensional atomic superfluid following a fast interaction ramp from repulsion to attraction. We find the conditions and time scales for a superfluid vortex to radially converge into a quasi-stationary density profile, demonstrating the spontaneous formation of a vortex soliton-like structure in an atomic Bose gas. We record an emergent self-similar dynamics caused by an azimuthal modulational instability, which amplifies initial density perturbations and leads to the eventual splitting of a solitonic ring profile or direct fragmentation of a superfluid into disordered, but roughly circular arrays of Townes soliton-like wavepackets. These dynamics are qualitatively reproduced by simulations based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. However, a discrepancy in the magnitude of amplified density fluctuations predicted by our mean-field analysis suggests the presence of effects beyond the mean-field approximation. Our study sets the stage for exploring out-of-equilibrium dynamics of vortex quantum matter quenched to attractive interactions and their universal characteristics.

Title: Quantum decoherence by magnetic fluctuations in a magnetic topological insulator
Authors: Ruben Saatjian, Simon Dovrén, Kohtaro Yamakawa, Ryan S. Russell, James G. Analytis, John W. Harter
Abstract: In magnetic topological insulators, spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking by intrinsic magnetic order can gap the topological surface spectrum, resulting in exotic properties like axion electrodynamics, the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and other topological magnetoelectric responses. Understanding the magnetic order and its coupling to topological states is essential to harness these properties. Here, we leverage near-resonant magnetic dipole optical second harmonic generation to probe magnetic fluctuations in the candidate axion insulator EuSn$_2$(As,P)$_2$ across its antiferromagnetic phase boundary. We observe a pronounced dimensional crossover in the quantum decoherence induced by magnetic fluctuations, whereby two-dimensional in-plane ferromagnetic correlations at high temperatures give way to three-dimensional long-range order at the Néel temperature. We also observe the breaking of rotational symmetry within the long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic state and map out the resulting spatial domain structure. More generally, we demonstrate the unique capabilities of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to study quantum coherence and fluctuations in magnetic quantum materials.

Title: Chiral Gapless Spin Liquid in Hyperbolic Space
Authors: Felix Dusel, Tobias Hofmann, Atanu Maity, Rémy Mosseri, Julien Vidal, Yasir Iqbal, Martin Greiter, Ronny Thomale
Abstract: We analyze the Kitaev model on the $\{9,3\}$ hyperbolic lattice. The $\{9,3\}$ is formed by a regular tricoordinated tiling of nonagons, where the 3-color coding of bonds according to the inequivalent Kitaev Ising spin couplings yields the natural generalization of the original Kitaev model for Euclidean regular honeycomb tiling. Upon investigation of the bulk spectrum for large finite size droplets, we identify a gapless chiral $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid state featuring spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking. Due to its non-commutative translation group structure, such type of hyperbolic spin liquid is conjectured to feature chiral quasiparticles with a potentially non-Abelian Bloch profile.

Title: The Streda Formula for Floquet Systems: Topological Invariants and Quantized Anomalies from Cesaro Summation
Authors: Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Gonzalo Usaj, Nathan Goldman
Abstract: The Středa formula establishes a fundamental connection between the topological invariants characterizing the bulk of topological matter and the presence of gapless edge modes. In this work, we extend the Středa formula to periodically driven systems, providing a rigorous framework to elucidate the unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet systems, while offering a link between Floquet winding numbers and tractable response functions. Using the Sambe representation of periodically driven systems, we analyze the response of the unbounded Floquet density of states to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-Středa response is regularized through Cesàro summation, yielding a well-defined, quantized result within spectral gaps. The response features two physically distinct contributions: a quantized charge flow between edge and bulk, and an anomalous energy flow between the system and the drive, offering new insight into the nature of anomalous edge states. This result rigorously connects Floquet winding numbers to the orbital magnetization density of Floquet states and holds broadly, from clean to disordered and inhomogeneous systems. This is further supported by providing a real-space formulation of the Floquet-Středa response, which introduces a local topological marker suited for periodically driven settings. In translationally-invariant systems, the framework yields a remarkably simple expression for Floquet winding numbers involving geometric properties of Floquet-Bloch bands. A concrete experimental protocol is proposed to extract the Floquet-Středa response via particle-density measurements in systems coupled to engineered baths. Finally, by expressing the topological invariants through the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, this approach opens a promising route toward the topological characterization of interacting driven phases.

Title: Emergence of Nodal-Knot Transitions by Disorder
Authors: Ming Gong, Peng-Lu Zhao, Hai-Zhou Lu, Qian Niu, X. C. Xie
Abstract: Under certain symmetries, degenerate points in three-dimensional metals form one-dimensional nodal lines. These nodal lines sometimes exhibit intricate knotted structures and have been studied in various contexts. As one of the most common physical perturbations, disorder effects often trigger novel quantum phase transitions. For nodal-knot phases, whether disorder can drive knot transitions remains an open and intriguing question. Employing renormalization-group calculations, we demonstrate that nodal-knot transitions emerge in the presence of weak disorder. Specifically, both chemical-potential-type and magnetic-type disorders can induce knot transitions, resulting in the emergence of distinct knot topologies. The transition can be quantitatively characterized by changes in topological invariants such as the knot Wilson loop integrals. Our findings open up a new avenue for manipulating the topology of nodal-knot phases through disorder effects.

Title: Two-dimensional bosonic droplets in a harmonic trap
Authors: Fabian Brauneis, Artem G. Volosniev, Hans-Werner Hammer
Abstract: We investigate a system of bosons in a two-dimensional harmonic trap. In the limit of strong attractive interactions, the bosons make a droplet insensitive to external confinement. For weak interactions, in contrast, the ground state is given by the harmonic trap. In this work, we conduct a variational study of the transition between these two limits. We find that this transition occurs abruptly at the critical interaction strength whose value is universal if scaled appropriately with the number of particles. To connect the abrupt change in the properties of the system to the classical description of phase transitions, we analyze the static response of the Bose gas related to the isothermal compressibility. Finally, we perform numerically exact calculations for a few particles to demonstrate the effects of finite range interactions on this transition. We conclude that finite range effects wash out the point of transition.

Title: Persistent currents in ultracold gases
Authors: Juan Polo, Wayne Jordan Chetcuti, Tobias Haug, Anna Minguzzi, Kevin Wright, Luigi Amico
Abstract: Persistent currents flowing in spatially closed tracks define one of the most iconic concepts in mesoscopic physics. They have been studied in solid-state platforms such as superfluids, superconductors and metals. Cold atoms trapped in magneto-optical toroidal circuits and driven by suitable artificial gauge fields allow us to study persistent currents with unprecedented control and flexibility of the system's physical conditions. Here, we review persistent currents of ultracold matter. Capitalizing on the remarkable progress in driving different atomic species to quantum degeneracy, persistent currents of single or multicomponent bosons/fermions, and their mixtures can be addressed within the present experimental know-how. This way, fundamental concepts of quantum science and many-body physics, like macroscopic quantum coherence, solitons, vortex dynamics, fermionic pairing and BEC-BCS crossover can be studied from a novel perspective. Finally, we discuss how persistent currents can form the basis of new technological applications like matter-wave gyroscopes and interferometers.

Title: Non-reciprocity in magnon mediated charge-spin-orbital current interconversion
Authors: José Omar Ledesma-Martin, Edgar Galindez-Ruales, Sachin Krishnia, Felix Fuhrmann, Minh Duc Tran, Rahul Gupta, Marcel Gasser, Dongwook Go, Akashdeep Kamra, Gerhard Jakob, Yuriy Mokrousov, Mathias Kläui
Abstract: In magnetic systems, angular momentum is carried by spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Nonlocal devices, comprising heavy-metal nanowires on magnetic insulators like yttrium iron garnet (YIG), enable angular momentum transport via magnons. These magnons are polarized by spin accumulation at the interface through the spin Hall effect (SHE) and detected via the inverse SHE (iSHE). The processes are generally reciprocal, as demonstrated by comparable efficiencies when reversing injector and detector roles. However, introducing Ru, which enables the orbital Hall effect (OHE), disrupts this reciprocity. In our system, magnons polarized through combined SHE and OHE and detected via iSHE are 35% more efficient than the reverse process. We attribute this nonreciprocity to nonzero spin vorticity, resulting from varying electron drift velocities across the Pt/Ru interface. This study highlights the potential of orbital transport mechanisms in influencing angular momentum transport and efficiency in nonlocal spintronic devices.

Title: Thermal Hall response of an abelian chiral spin liquid at finite temperatures
Authors: Avijit Maity, Haoyu Guo, Subir Sachdev, Vikram Tripathi
Abstract: Thermal Hall transport has emerged as a valuable tool for probing the fractionalized excitations in chiral quantum spin liquids. Observing quantized thermal Hall response, expected at temperatures below the spectral gap, has been challenging and controversial. The finite temperature behavior, especially in the quantum critical regime above the spectral gap, can provide useful signatures of the underlying topological order. In this context, we study the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a kagome lattice that is believed to be a U$(1)$ Dirac spin liquid over a wide intermediate energy range. Scalar spin chirality perturbations turn this into a gapped abelian chiral spin liquid (CSL) with semionic topological order. Using a recently developed large-$N$ technique [Guo et al., Phys. Rev. B 101, 195126 (2020)], we obtain explicit expressions for the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ at finite temperatures taking into account both matter and gauge fluctuations. At low temperatures below the spectral gap, the quantized thermal Hall response agrees with that expected from conformal field theory and gravitational anomaly arguments. Our main finding is that in a large temperature window spanning the spectral gap and the Curie temperature scales where quantum critical fluctuations dominate, $\kappa_{xy}/T$ obeys a power-law with logarithmic corrections. Our analysis also provides a route to understanding the thermal Hall response at higher temperatures in the quantum critical regime.

Title: Kibble-Zurek scaling of the superfluid-supersolid transition in an elongated dipolar gas
Authors: Wyatt Kirkby, Hayder Salman, Thomas Gasenzer, Lauriane Chomaz
Abstract: We simulate interaction quenches crossing from a superfluid to a supersolid state in a dipolar quantum gas of ${}^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ atoms, trapped in an elongated tube with periodic boundary conditions, via the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. A freeze-out time is observed through a delay in supersolid formation after crossing the critical point. We compute the density-density correlations at the freeze-out time and extract the frozen correlation length for the solid order. An analysis of the freeze-out time and correlation length versus the interaction quench rate allows us to extract universal exponents corresponding to the relaxation time and correlation length based on predictions of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Over several orders of magnitude, clear power-law scaling is observed for both the freeze-out time and the correlation length, and the corresponding exponents are compatible with predictions based on the excitation spectrum calculated via Bogoliubov theory. Defects due to independent local breaking of translational symmetry, contributing to globally incommensurate supersolid order, are identified, and their number at the freeze-out time is found to also scale as a power law. Our results support the hypothesis of a continuous transition whose universality class remains to be determined but appears to differ from that of the (1+1)D XY model.

Title: Anomalous geometric transport signatures of topological Euler class
Authors: Ashwat Jain, Wojciech J. Jankowski, Robert-Jan Slager
Abstract: We investigate Riemannian quantum-geometric structures in semiclassical transport features of two-dimensional multigap topological phases. In particular, we study nonlinear Hall-like bulk electric current responses and, accordingly, semiclassical equations of motion induced by the presence of a topological Euler invariant. We provide analytic understanding of these quantities by phrasing them in terms of momentum-space geodesics and geodesic deviation equations and further corroborate these insights with numerical solutions. Within this framework, we moreover uncover anomalous bulk dynamics associated with the second- and third-order nonlinear Hall conductivities induced by a patch Euler invariant. As a main finding, our results show how one can reconstruct the Euler invariant by coupling to electric fields at nonlinear order and from the gradients of the electric fields. Furthermore, we comment on the possibility of deducing the nontrivial non-Abelian Euler class invariant specifically in second-order nonlinear ballistic conductance measurements within a triple-contact setup, which was recently proposed to probe the Euler characteristics of more general Fermi surfaces. Generally, our results provide a route for deducing the topology in real materials that exhibit the Euler invariant by analyzing bulk electrical currents.

Title: Measurement-induced phase transition in periodically driven free-fermionic systems
Authors: Pallabi Chatterjee, Ranjan Modak
Abstract: It is well known that unitary evolution tends to increase entanglement, whereas continuous monitoring counteracts this growth by pinning the wavefunction trajectories to the eigenstates of the measurement operators. In this work, we investigate the fate of the measurement-induced phase transition in a periodically driven free-fermionic quantum system, where the hopping amplitude is modulated periodically in time using a square pulse. In the high-frequency limit, a renormalization group analysis of the non-Hermitian quantum sine-Gordon model [as proposed in {Phys. Rev. X 11, 041004 (2021)}] reveals that if the hopping amplitude is varied symmetrically around zero, the system always favors the area-law phase, where the steady-state entanglement entropy is independent of subsystem size. In contrast, asymmetry in the drive amplitudes tends to promote entanglement growth. Furthermore, numerical evidence for the system sizes accessible to us suggests that decreasing the drive frequency typically favors entanglement growth. For such driven systems, at least for reasonably small frequency regimes, as a function of measurement strength, we observe a potential signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition between a gapless critical phase, characterized by logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy with subsystem size, and a gapped area-law phase. However, it is almost impossible to rule out the possibility that the transition observed here is not an actual thermodynamic transition, but a finite-size crossover between logarithmic to area law entanglement phase. Even in that scenario, the critical length scale beyond which the area law phase prevails increases with the increasing time period of driving. On the other hand, for a symmetric drive, the system consistently exhibits an area-law phase, regardless of the driving frequency.

Title: Statistical Mechanics of Support Vector Regression
Authors: Abdulkadir Canatar, SueYeon Chung
Abstract: A key problem in deep learning and computational neuroscience is relating the geometrical properties of neural representations to task performance. Here, we consider this problem for continuous decoding tasks where neural variability may affect task precision. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we study the average-case learning curves for $\varepsilon$-insensitive Support Vector Regression ($\varepsilon$-SVR) and discuss its capacity as a measure of linear decodability. Our analysis reveals a phase transition in training error at a critical load, capturing the interplay between the tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$ and neural variability. We uncover a double-descent phenomenon in the generalization error, showing that $\varepsilon$ acts as a regularizer, both suppressing and shifting these peaks. Theoretical predictions are validated both with toy models and deep neural networks, extending the theory of Support Vector Machines to continuous tasks with inherent neural variability.

Title: Saturation of thermal and spin conductances in a dissipative superfluid junction
Authors: Meng-Zi Huang, Philipp Fabritius, Jeffrey Mohan, Mohsen Talebi, Simon Wili, Tilman Esslinger
Abstract: Fermionic superfluid junctions typically exhibit suppressed thermal and spin transport due to the presence of a pairing gap but allow coherent particle transport. While dissipation generally weakens coherent transport, it can also induce excitations that open other transport channels. In this work, we experimentally study a one-dimensional superfluid junction of strongly interacting fermions with local particle loss and observe dissipation-induced thermal and spin transport that appear to saturate at strong dissipation. Notably, in this regime, the measured thermal and spin conductances are comparable to the universal quantized conductance of one-dimensional ideal Fermi gas. Qualitatively similar behavior is observed for two dissipation mechanisms, either spin-imbalanced or pairwise losses. Our findings provide new insights into transport in interacting open quantum systems and suggest possibilities of dissipative control of spin and thermoelectric transport.

Title: A Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound with a first-order system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora, Pablo Pais
Abstract: A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bounded from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations. When such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed, and the implications of these results are outlined.

Title: Stokes flow in an electronic fluid with odd viscosity
Authors: Yonatan Messica, Alex Levchenko, Dmitri B. Gutman
Abstract: We investigate the transition between elastic and viscous regimes for time-reversal broken Weyl semimetals. In these materials, Hall transport occurs through two parallel channels: the Fermi sea and the Fermi surface. The Fermi sea part remains unaffected by electron-electron scattering, whereas the Fermi surface is influenced by it. We model the disorder by dilute impenetrable spherical impurities. We analyze the flow of an electronic fluid with a finite odd viscosity in the presence of such disorder and compute the conductivity tensor. We find that in the generic case of finite intrinsic conductivity, the Hall angle in the viscous regime is parametrically suppressed compared to the elastic regime. In the special case where the intrinsic conductivity vanishes, the ratio between the transverse and the longitudinal resistivities matches the ratio between the odd and even components of the viscosity tensor.

Title: Strain induced topological phase transitions in split and line graphs of bipartite lattices featuring flat bands
Authors: Shivam Sharma, Amartya S. Banerjee
Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, ferromagnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably, all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating, semimetallic, and topological phases. In addition to exploring understudied lattices, our contribution comprehensively analyzes the potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.

Title: The polyhedral structure underlying programmable self-assembly
Authors: Maximilian C. Hübl, Thomas E. Videbæk, Daichi Hayakawa, W. Benjamin Rogers, Carl P. Goodrich
Abstract: Experiments have reached a monumental capacity for designing and synthesizing microscopic particles for self-assembly, making it possible to precisely control particle concentrations, shapes, and interactions. However, more physical insight is needed before we can take full advantage of this vast design space to assemble nanostructures with complex form and function. Here we show how a significant part of this design space can be quickly and comprehensively understood by identifying a class of thermodynamic constraints that act on it. These thermodynamic constraints form a high-dimensional convex polyhedron that determines which nanostructures can be assembled at high equilibrium yield and reveals limitations that govern the coexistence of structures, which we verify through detailed, quantitative assembly experiments of nanoscale particles synthesized using DNA origami. Strong experimental agreement confirms the importance of the polyhedral structure and motivates its use as a predictive tool for the rational design of self-assembly. These results uncover fundamental physical relationships underpinning many-component programmable self-assembly in equilibrium and form the basis for robust inverse-design, applicable to a wide array of systems from biological protein complexes to synthetic nanomachines.

Title: Non-Gaussian density fluctuations in the Dean-Kawasaki equation
Authors: Louison Le Bon, Antoine Carof, Pierre Illien
Abstract: Computing analytically the $n$-point density correlations in systems of interacting particles is a long-standing problem of statistical physics, with a broad range of applications, from the interpretation of scattering experiments in simple liquids, to the understanding of their collective dynamics. For Brownian particles, i.e. with overdamped Langevin dynamics, the microscopic density obeys a stochastic evolution equation, known as the Dean-Kawasaki equation. In spite of the importance of this equation, its complexity makes it very difficult to analyze the statistics of the microscopic density beyond simple Gaussian approximations. In this work, resorting to a path-integral description of the stochastic dynamics and relying on a saddle-point analysis in the limit of high density and weak interactions between the particles, we go beyond the usual linearization of the Dean-Kawasaki equation, and we compute exactly the three- and four-point density correlation functions. This result opens the way to using the Dean-Kawasaki equation beyond the simple Gaussian treatments, and could find applications to understand many fluctuation-related effects in soft and active matter systems.

Title: Enhancing the hyperpolarizability of crystals with quantum geometry

Abstract: We demonstrate that higher-order electric susceptibilities in crystals can be enhanced and understood through nontrivial topological invariants and quantum geometry, using one-dimensional $\pi$-conjugated chains as representative model systems. First, we show that the crystalline-symmetry-protected topology of these chains imposes a lower bound on their quantum metric and hyperpolarizabilities. Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of nonlinear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced nonlinear optical properties.

Authors: Fartash Chalangari, Joonas Keski-Rahkonen, Simo Selinummi, Esa Räsänen
Abstract: Quantum scars have recently been directly visualized in graphene quantum dots (Nature 635, 841 (2024)), revealing their resilience and influence on electron dynamics in mesoscopic systems. Here, we examine variational scarring in two-dimensional quantum dots and demonstrate that these states remain robust even in an open system. We show that controlled perturbations enable modulation of electronic transmission via scarred states, presenting a viable approach to tuning quantum transport. These findings provide insights into the role of scarring in mesoscopic transport and open pathways for experimental realization in quantum devices.

Title: Efficient First-Principles Framework for Overdamped Phonon Dynamics and Anharmonic Electron-Phonon Coupling in Superionic Materials
Authors: Yuxuan Wang, Marios Zacharias, Xiao Zhang, Nick Pant, Jacky Even, Pierre F. P. Poudeu, Emmanouil Kioupakis
Abstract: Relying on the anharmonic special displacement method, we introduce an ab initio quasistatic polymorphous framework to describe local disorder, anharmonicity, and electron-phonon coupling in superionic conductors. Using the example of cubic Cu2Se, we show that positional polymorphism yields extremely overdamped anharmonic vibrations while preserving transverse acoustic phonons, consistent with experiments. We also demonstrate well-defined electronic band structures with large band gap openings due to polymorphism of 1.0 eV and calculate anharmonic electron-phonon renormalization, yielding band gap narrowing with increasing temperature in agreement with previous measurements. Our approach opens the way for efficient ab initio electronic structure calculations in superionic crystals to elucidate their compelling high figure-of-merit.

Title: Band-edge superfluid of Bose-Einstein condensates in the spin-orbit-coupled Zeeman lattice
Authors: Huaxin He, Fengtao Pang, Hao Lyu, Yongping Zhang
Abstract: Since the first experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensates in a spin-orbit-coupled Zeeman lattice, a wide range of applications have been found in these systems. Here, we systematically study the ground-state phase diagram of the systems. We address that the band-edge phase in the ground-state phase diagram is exotic and exists in a very broad parameter regime. The superfluidity of the band-edge states is identified by elementary excitations and superfluid fraction.

Title: When Homogeneous Systems Meet Dissipation and Disorder
Authors: Xixi Feng, Ao Zhou, Feng Lu, Gao Xianlong, Shujie Cheng
Abstract: We investigate the localization and topological properties of the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in a one-dimensional homogeneous system. Our results demonstrate that, despite the absence of disorder in the initial system, the NESS can exhibit localization under bond dissipation. These dissipation-driven localization and delocalization phenomena are clearly distinguished using Wigner distributions. Furthermore, we find that the initial localization characteristics of the system significantly influence the localization properties of the NESS. Drawing upon the concept of Bose-Einstein condensate broadening in cold-atom experiments, along with experimental data, we systematically characterize the impact of bond dissipation and disorder on the localization and topological properties of the NESS. The phase diagram reveals that the NESS can be topologically non-trivial even when the initial system is topologically trivial, and that the topological triviality of the initial system strengthens the topological non-triviality of the NESS. This work provides new insights into the localization and topological phase transitions in homogeneous systems induced by bond dissipation and disorder.

Title: Asynchronous mass inversion enriched quantum anomalous Hall states in multilayer graphene
Authors: Xilin Feng, Zi-Ting Sun, K.T.Law
Abstract: Recently, multilayer graphene systems have attracted significant attention due to the discovery of a variety of intriguing phases, particularly quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (RPG), both QAH states with Chern number $C = -5$ and $C = -3$ have been observed. While the $C = -5$ QAH state is well understood, the origin of the $C = -3$ QAH state remains unclear. In this letter, we propose that the $C = -3$ QAH state, as well as the topological phase transition from $C = -3$ to $C = -5$ state in RPG, arises from an asynchronous mass inversion mechanism driven by the interplay between trigonal warping, staggered layer order, and the displacement field: Trigonal warping splits the low-energy bands of RPG into a central touching point and three satellite Dirac cones. Meanwhile, the coexistence of the staggered layer order and displacement field induces a momentum-dependent effective mass in the low-energy bands. Consequently, mass inversions at the central touching point and the satellite Dirac cones, induced by an increasing displacement field, can occur asynchronously, leading to the formation of the $C = -3$ QAH state and the topological phase transition from QAH state with $C=-3$ to $C=-5$. Additionally, based on this mechanism, we predict the presence of a $C=3$ QAH state in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene (RTG), which can be detected experimentally. Furthermore, this mechanism can also be applied to Bernal tetralayer graphene (BTG), explaining the origin of the observed $C=6$ QAH state.

Title: Understanding entropy production via a thermal zero-player game
Authors: M. Süzen
Abstract: A new thermal bath scheme for Ising-Conway Entropy Game (ICEg) is introduced. New game moves for sampling the given temperature are achieved via Monte Carlo dynamics of both Metropolis and Glauber in a stochastic game. This kind of approach makes the game an ideal tool for demonstrating thermal dependency of entropy production in a novel way. Using this new approach, Ising-Conway Entropy game rate of entropy production depending on different temperatures is explored. Thermalized game is shown to be physically interesting and a plausible test bed for studying complex dynamical systems in classical statistical mechanics, that is conceptually simple, pedagogically accessible, yet realistic.

Title: Field-induced Multi-$\boldsymbol{\vec{Q}}$ States in a Pyrochlore Heisenberg Magnet
Authors: Cecilie Glittum, Olav F. Syljuåsen
Abstract: We construct exact ground states of the $J_1$-$J_{3b}$ classical Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice in the presence of a magnetic field. They are non-coplanar multi-$\vec{Q}$ spin configurations with a large magnetic unit cell that generalize the previously found coplanar sublattice pairing states. Using linear spin wave theory, we show that entropy favors these multi-$\vec{Q}$ states at low temperatures in high magnetic fields. This is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations, and a phase diagram is constructed. We also calculate the zero-temperature dynamical structure factor. Besides the usual Goldstone modes associated with the ordering $\vec{Q}$s, we find high intensity gapless modes at momenta where there are no Bragg peaks.

Title: Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered One Dimensional Critical States
Authors: Yuxuan Guo, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu
Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this work, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under local strong symmetry preserving decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Importantly, we analyze this transition from two complementary perspectives: on one hand, through the behavior of order parameters that characterize the symmetry breaking; on the other hand, from a quantum information viewpoint by studying entropic quantities and the concept of quantum recoverability. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrary decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Importantly, our unified theoretical framework is applicable to a broad class of one-dimensional quantum systems, including spin chains and fermionic systems, whose low-energy physics can be described by Luttinger liquid theory, under arbitrary symmetry-preserving decoherence channels. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.

Title: A Promising Method for Strongly Correlated Electrons in Two Dimensions: Gutzwiller-Guided Density Matrix Renormalization Group
Authors: Hui-Ke Jin, Rong-Yang Sun, Hong-Hao Tu, Yi Zhou
Abstract: The study of strongly correlated electron systems remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly in two-dimensional (2D) systems hosting various exotic phases of matter including quantum spin liquids, unconventional superconductivity, and topological orders. Although Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) has established itself as a pillar for simulating one-dimensional quantum systems, its application to 2D systems has long been hindered by the notorious ``local minimum'' issues. Recent methodological breakthroughs have addressed this challenge by incorporating Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions as initial states for DMRG simulations. This hybrid approach, referred to as DMRG guided by Gutzwiller-projected wave functions (or Gutzwiller-guided DMRG), has demonstrated remarkable improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to explore exotic quantum phases such as topological orders. This review examines the theoretical underpinnings of this approach, details key algorithmic developments, and showcases its applications in recent studies of 2D quantum systems.

Title: Effective reduction in thermal conductivity by high-density dislocations in SrTiO3
Authors: Jinxue Ding, Jiawen Zhang, Jinfeng Dong, Kimitaka Higuchi, Atsutomo Nakamura, Wenjun Lu, Bo Sun, Xufei Fang
Abstract: Decreasing thermal conductivity is important for designing efficient thermoelectric devices. Traditional engineering strategies have focused on point defects and interface design. Recently, dislocations as line defects have emerged as a new tool for regulating thermal conductivity. In ceramics-based thermoelectric materials, the key challenge lies in achieving sufficiently high-density dislocations to effectively scatter phonons, as the typical dislocation density in ceramics after bulk deformation is constrained to 10 to the power of 12 per square meter. In this work, we adopted the mechanical imprinting method and achieved a dislocation density of 10 to the power of 15 per square meter in single-crystal SrTiO3, which is known for its room-temperature plasticity and acts as a promising material for thermoelectric applications. Using the time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) method, we measured about a 50% reduction in thermal conductivity over a broad temperature range (80 to 400 K) with the engineered high-density dislocations. These results suggest that tuning dislocations could offer a new path to minimizing thermal conductivity for engineering thermoelectric materials.

Title: Quantum Resistor-Capacitor Circuit with two Majorana Bound States
Authors: Cong Li, Bing Dong
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the equations of motion for a system composed of a spinless quantum dot coupled to two normal leads and two Majorana bound states (MBSs), utilizing the auxiliary-mode expansion method and the nonequilibrium Green function technique. Subsequently, we use these equations to analyze the linear conductance, adiabatic linear capacitance, and adiabatic linear relaxation resistance of the system. We find that when the phase difference between the two MBSs is an integer multiple of $\pi$, the MBSs enter the zero mode, leading to the complete suppression of the linear relaxation resistance. In this case, the relaxation resistance is highly sensitive to the MBSs modes. On the other hand, when the phase difference is not an integer multiple of $\pi$, the linear conductance is fully suppressed. Furthermore, the linear relaxation resistance remains completely suppressed, even when the MBSs are not in the zero mode, and the system loses its sensitivity to the MBSs modes.

Title: Stochastic 1D search-and-capture as a G/M/c queueing model
Authors: José Giral-Barajas, Paul C Bressloff
Abstract: We study the accumulation of resources within a target due to the interplay between continual delivery, driven by 1D stochastic search processes, and sequential consumption. The assumption of sequential consumption is key because it changes the commonly used $G/M/\infty$ queue to a $G/M/c$ queue. Combining the theory of $G/M/c$ queues with the theory of first-passage times, we derive general conditions for the search process to ensure that the number of resources within the queue converges to a steady state and compute explicit expressions for the mean and variance of the number of resources within the queue at steady state. We then compare the performance of the $G/M/c$ queue with that of the $G/M/\infty$ queue for an increasing number of servers. We extend the model to consider two competing targets and show that, under specific scenarios, an additional target is beneficial to the original target. Finally, we study the effects of multiple searchers. Using renewal theory, we numerically compute the inter-arrival time density for $M$ searchers in the Laplace space, which allows us to exploit the explicit expressions for the steady-state statistics of the number of resources within $G/M/1$ and $G/M/\infty$ queues, and compare their behaviour with different numbers of searchers. Overall, the $G/M/c$ queue shows a tighter dependence on the configuration of the search process than the $G/M/\infty$ queue does.

Title: Sub-nm Curvature Unlocks Quantum Flexoelectricity in Graphene
Authors: Sathvik Ajay Iyengar, James G. McHugh, Jonathan P. Salvage, Robert Vajtai, Alan Dalton, Manoj Tripathi, Pulickel M. Ajayan, Vincent Meunier
Abstract: Flexoelectricity, polarization induced by strain gradients, is especially pronounced in two-dimensional (2D) materials due to their mechanical flexibility and sensitivity to mechanical deformation. In nanostructures with sub-nm curvature, this effect is governed by quantum-mechanical polarization and electrostatic modulation, not merely classical lattice distortion. Here, we present the first direct experimental and theoretical demonstration of large intrinsic quantum flexoelectricity in graphene nanowrinkles, exhibiting polarization densities (P_{th} ~ 4 C/m^{2}, P_{exp} ~ 1 C/m^{2}) that exceed those of mesoscale systems by 5 to 7 orders of magnitude. These nanowrinkles, with sub-nm radii of curvature at their apex, undergo atomic-level buckling and result in localized strain fields, as confirmed by sub-micron Raman spectroscopy. These curvatures create an asymmetry to {\pi}-orbital interactions across the atomic layer, which, in turn, leads to localized polarization densities. Kelvin probe force microscopy reveals curvature-dependent work function shifts consistent with flexoelectric polarization, while conductive atomic force microscopy detects reproducible flexoelectric currents exhibiting a threshold voltage ({\Phi}th ~1 V) that matches the band offset predicted by ab initio calculations (~1.2 V). Together, these results confirm how flexoelectric dipoles reshape the local electronic potential. Graphene nanowrinkles thus provide a pristine platform for uncovering quantum-mechanical flexoelectricity: a fundamentally ubiquitous effect, whose study in the simplest crystalline material can illuminate electromechanical behavior across condensed matter, soft matter, and biological systems.

Title: Pressure-Induced Volume Collapse and Metallization in Inverse Spinel Co$_2$TiO$_4$
Authors: Mrinmay Sahu, Souvick Chakraborty, Bidisha Mukherjee, Bishnupada Ghosh, Asish Kumar Mishra, Satyabrata Raj, Goutam Dev Mukherjee
Abstract: The structural, vibrational, electronic, and magnetic properties of inverse spinel $Co_2TiO_4$ (CTO-Sp) under high-pressure (HP) conditions are systematically investigated using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, in situ optical microscopy, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. At ambient conditions, CTO-Sp exhibits a cubic phase with a space group $Fd\bar{3}m$, and it undergoes two notable structural phase transitions at HP. The first transition, occurring at approximately 7.3 GPa, leads to the tetragonal-$I4_1/amd$ phase with minimal alteration in unit cell volume. {The second transition takes place near 17.3 GPa, where two orthorhombic phases emerge and coexist above this pressure.} This second structural transition corresponds to a first-order phase transition involving a significant reduction in unit cell volume of approximately 17.5$\%$. The bulk compressibility of CTO-Sp and its HP post-spinel phases is almost equal to the average polyhedral compressibility within each phase. DFT calculations reveal a high-spin to low-spin transition, accompanied by the collapse of local magnetic moments in the $Cmcm$ orthorhombic phase, leading to the sample's pressure-induced metallization.

Title: Exact results for spin glass criticality
Authors: Gesualdo Delfino
Abstract: In recent years scale invariant scattering theory provided the first exact access to the magnetic critical properties of two-dimensional statistical systems with quenched disorder. We show how the theory extends to the overlap variables entering the characterization of spin glass properties. The resulting exact fixed point equations yield both the magnetic and, for the first time, the spin glass renormalization group fixed points. For the case of the random bond Ising model, on which we focus, the spin glass subspace of solutions is found to contain a line of fixed points. We discuss the implications of the results for Ising spin glass criticality and compare with the available numerical results.

Title: Active Matter Flocking via Predictive Alignment
Authors: Julian Giraldo-Barreto, Viktor Holubec
Abstract: Understanding collective self-organization in active matter, such as bird flocks and fish schools, remains a grand challenge in physics. Interactions that induce alignment are essential for flocking; however, alignment alone is generally insufficient to maintain group cohesion in the presence of noise, leading traditional models to introduce artificial boundaries or explicit attractive forces. Here, we propose a model that achieves cohesive flocking through purely alignment-based interactions by introducing predictive alignment, in which agents reorient to maximize alignment with the prevailing orientations of their anticipated future neighbors. Implemented in a discrete-time Vicsek-type framework, this approach delivers robust, noise-resistant cohesion without additional parameters. In the stable regime, flock size scales linearly with interaction radius, remaining nearly immune to noise or propulsion speed, and the group coherently follows a leader under noise. These findings reveal how predictive strategies enhance self-organization, paving the way for a new class of active matter models blending physics and cognitive-like dynamics.

Title: Structural Control of Atomic Silicon Wires

Leon (1), Lucian Livadaru (1), Taras Chutora (1), Max Yuan (1), Roshan Achal (2), Jason Pitters (3), Robert Wolkow (1 and 2) ((1) University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, (2) Quantum Silicon Inc., Edmonton, Canada, (3) National Research Council of Canada, Edmonton, Canada)
Abstract: Bare Si(100)-2$\times$1 surface atoms exhibit a buckled structure where one Si atom in a dimer is lowered while the other is raised, leading to two possible buckling configurations equivalent in energy. The relatively low energy barrier between these configurations allows dimers to flip rapidly and uncontrollably unless stabilized by surface defects or observed at low temperatures due to reduced thermal energy using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). This rapid flipping results in a time-averaged symmetric appearance under STM. In this study, we investigated variable length buckled dimer wires on the hydrogenated Si(100) surface composed of silicon dangling bonds for the first time. We demonstrate that on degenerate p-type silicon at 4.5 K, the rapid switching of these dimers can be frozen at low scanning biases. Such buckled wires can however be controllably flipped using a bias pulse. A line as long as 37 dimers was repeatedly uniformly flipped by a single pulse delivered near one terminus of the wire. The tip-directed flipping of a particular wire does not switch adjacent wires, suggesting binary wires can make well isolated rewritable binary memory elements. Furthermore, at sufficiently high biases switching generates telegraph noise that could be of utility for random number generation. The integration and encapsulation of these wires with previously described silicon dangling bond-made logic gates and binary wires might allow for self contained actuation and readout without requiring any role of an STM tip.

Title: Stainless steel in an electronically excited state
Authors: Nikita Medvedev
Abstract: Understanding the non-equilibrium behavior of stainless steel under extreme electronic excitation remains a critical challenge for laser processing and radiation science. We employ a hybrid framework integrating density-functional tight binding, transport Monte Carlo, and Boltzmann equations to model austenitic stainless steel (Fe$_{0.5875}$Cr$_{0.25}$Mn$_{0.09}$Ni$_{0.07}$C$_{0.0025}$) under ultrafast irradiation. The developed approach uniquely bridges atomic-scale electronic dynamics and mesoscale material responses, enabling the quantitative mapping of electron-temperature-dependent properties (electronic heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling) up to the the electronic temperatures Te~25,000 K. Two distinct lattice disordering mechanisms are identified: nonthermal melting at Te~10,000 K (the dose ~1.4 eV/atom), where the lattice collapses on sub-picosecond timescales without atomic heating driven by electronic excitation modifying the interatomic potential; and thermal melting (at ~0.45 eV/atom), induced by electron-phonon coupling on picosecond timescales. The derived parameters enable predictive modeling of stainless steel under extreme conditions, with implications for laser machining and radiation-resistant material design.

Title: Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica

Abstract: Silicon dioxide is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature so that they can be analysed at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La-APT). To achieve this goal, in this study we show that UV and deep UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.

Abstract: We study a thin film yttrium iron garnet sample that exhibits magnetic stripe domains due to a small perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Using wide-field magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements we reveal the domain pattern evolution as a function of applied field and discuss the role of the cubic anisotropy in the domain formation. Rich magnon spectra are observed in the stripe domain states, with a range of excitation conditions providing distinct spectra. The measurements are interpreted using micromagnetic simulations to provide the spatial profiles of each resonance mode. We further simulate domain patterns and resonance spectra accounting for the cubic anisotropy,with good correlation to experiment. This study highlights how non-collinear magnetic domain structures can host complex resonant behaviour in a low-damping magnetic material, with potential use in future magnonic applications.

Title: Extended Structural Dynamics -- Emergent Irreversibility from Reversible Dynamics
Authors: Patrick BarAvi
Abstract: The emergence of irreversibility in isolated, deterministic systems remains a central problem in the foundations of statistical mechanics. Traditional approaches, such as Boltzmann's H-theorem and Lanford's derivation of the Boltzmann equation, rely on probabilistic assumptions and are constrained to dilute gases and short timescales. In this work, we introduce Extended Structural Dynamics (ESD), a deterministic framework in which irreversibility arises from the internal geometry of structured particles. In ESD, particles possess finite size and internal degrees of freedom, such as rotation and vibration, that are dynamically coupled to translational motion. This coupling induces instability, nonlinear feedback, and chaotic mixing in the extended phase space, even under time-reversal symmetric laws. We show that equilibrium states exponentially dominate the accessible volume of phase space, while constrained configurations (e.g., pure rotation) form measure-zero subsets. This yields a geometric derivation of entropy growth, with reversal probabilities suppressed as Prev and recurrence times scaling as Trec. These results address the Loschmidt and Zermelo paradoxes without coarse-graining, randomness, or fine-tuning. We further extend the model to charged systems (cESD), where long-range electromagnetic interactions drive continuous structural coupling. ESD thus provides a deterministic and testable mechanism for emergent thermodynamic behavior, with applications ranging from mesoscopic systems to the cosmological arrow of time.

We also discuss the physical interpretation of this effect and give an estimation of its magnitude.

Title: Unified Magnetoelectric Mechanism for Spin Splitting in Magnets
Authors: Carlos Mera Acosta
Abstract: We identify a relativistic magnetoelectric correction that completes the theoretical description of spin splitting (SS) in magnetic systems. Derived from the Dirac equation, this term couples local magnetic moments to the scalar electric potential, providing a third fundamental mechanism, alongside Zeeman and spin-orbit coupling (SOC), that governs SS in ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and altermagnets. In compensated magnets, the correction depends on the difference in electric potential between symmetry-inequivalent motifs, $\mu_{\text{B}}(\mathcal{V}_1 - \mathcal{V}_2)\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \boldsymbol{m}$, which explains how finite SS emerges in the absence of SOC and enables a complete classification of momentum dependence and motif connectivity across all 32 point groups. Through illustrative examples, we show that distinct SS behaviors - quadratic (altermagnetic), linear (spin Zeeman effect), and $k$-independent (SS at $\Gamma$) - are specific manifestations of the proposed magnetoelectric relativistic mechanism, each governed by electric quadrupoles, dipoles, or monopoles, respectively. The formalism naturally extends to higher-order multipoles and more complex symmetries. This work establishes a unified framework for SS in magnets and provides a predictive tool for analyzing symmetry-allowed SS in magnetic materials.

Title: Spectrum Selective Interfaces and Materials towards Non-photothermal Saltwater Evaporation: Demonstration with a White Ceramic Wick
Authors: Navindra D. Singh, James Leung, Ji Feng, Alma K. González-Alcalde, Arial Tolentino, David Tuft, Juchen Guo, Luat T. Vuong
Abstract: Most solar desalination efforts are photothermal: they evaporate water with ``black'' materials that absorb as much sunlight as possible. Such ``brine-boiling'' methods are limited by the high thermal mass of water, i.e., its capacity to store and release heat. Here, we study the light-enhanced evaporation by a hard, white, aluminum nitride wick, and propose a route to selectively target salt-water bonds instead of bulk heating via deep-UV interactions. Through experiments and analyses that isolate the effects of light absorption and heating in aluminum nitride, we provide experimental evidence of a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation. Leverage of these light-matter interactions in white ceramic wicks may achieve low-cost, low-energy desalination, reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies, and contribute to new cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.

Title: Mechanisms and Stability of Li Dynamics in Amorphous Li-Ti-P-S-Based Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductors: A Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Study
Authors: Selva Chandrasekaran Selvaraj, Daiwei Wang, Donghai Wang, Anh T. Ngo
Abstract: Mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) exhibit both high ionic and electronic conductivity to improve the battery performance. In this work, we investigate the mechanism and stability of transport channels in our recently developed MIEC material, amorphous Ti-doped lithium phosphorus sulfide (LPS), using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a 99\% accurate machine-learning force field (MLFF) trained on \textit{ab-initio} MD data. The achieved MLFF helps efficient large-scale MD simulations on LPS with three Ti concentrations (10\%, 20\%, and 30\%) and six temperatures (25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 225$^\mathrm{o}$C) to calculate ionic conductivity, activation energy, Li-ion transport mechanism, and configurational entropy. Results show that ionic conductivities and activation energies are consistent with our recent experimental values. Moreover, Li-ion transport occurs via free-volume diffusion facilitated by the formation of disordered Li-S polyhedra. The enhanced stability of transport channels at 10\% and 20\% Ti doping, compared to 0\% and 30\%, is observed by analyzing the vibrational and configurational entropy of these disordered Li-S polyhedra. Overall, this study highlights the utility of MLFF-based large-scale MD simulations in explaining the transport mechanism and the stability of Li-ion in Ti-doped LPS electrolyte with significant computational efficiency.

Title: Observation of many-body coherence in quasi-one-dimensional attractive Bose gases
Authors: Hikaru Tamura, Sambit Banerjee, Rongjie Li, Panayotis Kevrekidis, Simeon I. Mistakidis, Chen-Lung Hung
Abstract: Macroscopic coherence is an important feature of quantum many-body systems exhibiting collective behaviors, with examples ranging from atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and quantum liquids to superconductors. Probing many-body coherence in a dynamically unstable regime, however, presents an intriguing and outstanding challenge in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here, we experimentally study the first- and second-order coherence of degenerate quasi-one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases quenched from repulsive to modulationally unstable attractive interaction regimes. The resulting dynamics, monitored by in-situ density and matter-wave interference imaging, reveals phase-coherent density wave evolutions arising from the interplay between noise-amplified density modulations and dispersive shock waves of broad interest within nonlinear physics. At longer times, the gases become phase-scrambled, exhibiting a finite correlation length. Interestingly, following an interaction quench back to the repulsive regime, we observe that quasi-long-range coherence can be spontaneously re-established. This captivating rephasing dynamics can be attributed to the nucleation and annihilation of density defects in the quasi-1D geometry. These results shed light on out-of-equilibrium phase coherence in quantum many-body systems in a regime where beyond mean-field effects may arise and theoretical approaches have not been well-established.

Title: Duplication-divergence growing graph models
Authors: Dario Borrelli
Abstract: In recent decades, it has been emphasized that the evolving structure of networks may be shaped by interaction principles that yield sparse graphs with a vertex degree distribution exhibiting an algebraic tail, and other structural traits that are not featured in traditional random graphs. In this respect, through a mean-field approach, this review tackles the statistical physics of graph models based on the interaction principle of duplication-divergence. Additional sophistications extending the duplication-divergence model are also reviewed as well as generalizations of other known models. Possible research gaps and related prior results are then discussed.

Title: On the theory of supermodulation of the superconducting order parameter by supermodulation of the apex distance in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$

Abstract: Recently using Scanning Josephson Tunneling Microscopy (SJTM) in the group of Séamus Davis a super-modulation of the superconducting order parameter induced by super-modulation of the distance $\delta$ between planar Cu and apical O was observed in [O'Mahony et al, On the electron pairing mechanism of copper-oxide high temperature superconductivity, PNAS Vol. 119(37), e2207449119 (2022)]. The authors conclude: "concurrence of prediction from strong correlation theory... with these observations indicates that... super-exchange is the electron pairing mechanism of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$." Additionally, the charge transfer energy $\mathcal{E}$, probably between O2$p_z$ and Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ levels was studied by SJTM, too. In our current theoretical study we use LCAO approximation and Hilbert space spanned on 5 atomic orbitals: Cu$4s$, Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$, O2$p_x$, O2$p_y$, O2$p_z$. For the only super-exchange amplitude $J_{sd}$ we use the Kondo double electron exchange between Cu$4s$ and Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and its anti-ferromagnetic sign is determined by adjacent to the copper ion in-plane oxygen orbitals. Within this approximations we have calculated: "Measured dependence of... electron-pair density $n_p$ on the displacement $\delta$ of the apical O atoms from the planar Cu atoms" on [O'Mahony et al., Fig. 5C] and obtained an excellent accuracy. We discuss that the correlation between the shape of Fermi contour and the critical temperature of optimally hole-doped cuprates can be considered as an analogue of the isotope effect of phonon superconductors. The analyzed SJTM experiment is one of the best confirmations of the [J. Röhler, Plane dimpling and Cu4s hybridization in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$, Physica B: Cond. Matt. Vol. 284-288, 1041 (2000)] idea that the hybridization of Cu$4s$ with conduction band leads to increasing of $T_c$.

Title: Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis
Authors: Klaus M. Frahm, Dima L. Shepelyansky
Abstract: We introduce the wealth thermalization hypothesis according to which the wealth shared in a country or the whole world is described by the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution with two conserved quantities of system wealth and norm or number of agents. This distribution depends on a dimensional parameter being the ratio of system total wealth and its dispersion range determined by highest revenues. At relatively small values of this ratio there is a formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, well studied in such physical systems as multimode optical fibers. This leads to a huge fraction of poor households and a small oligarchic fraction which monopolizes a dominant fraction of total wealth thus generating a strong inequality in human society. We show that this thermalization gives a good description of real data of Lorenz curves of US, UK, the whole world and capitalization of S\&P500 companies at New York Stock Exchange. Possible actions for inequality reduction are briefly discussed.

Title: Bootstrapping Flat-band Superconductors: Rigorous Lower Bounds on Superfluid Stiffness
Authors: Qiang Gao, Zhaoyu Han, Eslam Khalaf
Abstract: The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration-free interacting models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. A straightforward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities that are complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.

Title: Entanglement and quench dynamics in the thermally perturbed tricritical fixed point
Authors: Csilla Király, Máté Lencsés
Abstract: We consider the Blume--Capel model in the scaling limit to realize the thermal perturbation of the tricritical Ising fixed point. We develop a numerical scaling limit extrapolation for one-point functions and Rényi entropies in the ground state. In a mass quench scenario, we found long-lived oscillations despite the absence of explicit spin-flip symmetry breaking or confining potential. We construct form factors of branch-point twist fields in the paramagnetic phase. In the scaling limit of small quenches, we verify form factor predictions for the energy density and leading magnetic field using the dynamics of one-point functions, and branch-point twist fields using the dynamics of Rényi entropies.

Title: Valley resolved optical spectroscopy and coherent excitation of quantum Hall edge states in graphene
Authors: Ashutosh Singh, Maria Sebastian, Mikhail Tokman, Alexey Belyanin
Abstract: We show that chiral edge states in graphene under Quantum Hall effect conditions can be selectively probed and excited by terahertz or infrared radiation with single-quasiparticle sensitivity without affecting bulk states. Moreover, valley-selective excitation of edge states is possible with high fidelity. The underlying physical mechanism is the inevitable violation of adiabaticity and inversion symmetry breaking for electron states near the edge. This leads to the formation of Landau level-specific and valley-specific absorbance spectral peaks that are spectrally well separated from each other and from absorption by the bulk states, and have different polarization selection rules. Furthermore, inversion symmetry breaking enables coherent driving of chiral edge photocurrents due to second-order nonlinear optical rectification which becomes allowed in the electric dipole approximation.

Title: Observing Laughlin's pump using quantized edge states in graphene
Authors: Bjarke S. Jessen, Maëlle Kapfer, Yuhao Zhao, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Cory R. Dean, Oded Zilberberg
Abstract: Laughlin's thought experiment of quantized charge pumping is central to understanding the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) and the topological origin of its conductance quantization. Its direct experimental observation, however, has been hindered by the difficulty of realizing clean electronic edges. We address this by fabricating ultra-small, lithographically defined contacts on graphene. This creates a Corbino-equivalent system, with well-confined inner edge states. Crucially, the small contact size induces strong energy quantization of the edge states. This quantization allows us to directly resolve the spectral flow associated with Laughlin's pump. By tracing the finite-size resonances of the inner edge, we observe clear oscillations in conductance as a function of magnetic field and carrier density. The oscillation period scales with contact size, consistent with quantized charge transfer. Thus, our results provide a direct observation of the spectral flow underlying Laughlin's pump. The simplicity of the graphene platform makes this approach scalable and robust for exploring fundamental topological effects.

Title: Anomalous refractive index modulation and giant birefringence in 2D ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$
Authors: Houssam El Mrabet Haje, Roald J. H. van der Kolk, Trent M. Kyrk, Mazhar N. Ali
Abstract: 2D ferroelectric (FE) materials have opened new opportunities in non-volatile memories, computation and non-linear optics due to their robust polarization in the ultra-thin limit and inherent flexibility in device integration. Recently, interest has grown in the use of 2D FEs in electro-optics, demanding the exploration of their electronic and optical properties. In this work, we report the discovery of an unprecedented anomalous thickness-dependent change in refractive index, as large as $\delta n$ $\sim$ 23.2$\%$, in the 2D ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$, far above the ultra-thin limit, and at room temperature. Furthermore, CuInP$_2$S$_6$ exhibits a giant birefringence in the blue-ultraviolet regime, with a maximum $\vert n_{OOP} - n_{IP}\vert$ $\sim$ 1.24 at $t \sim$ 22 nm and $\lambda$ = 339.5 nm, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest of any known material in this wavelength regime. We relate changes in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ optical constants to changes in the Cu(I) FE polarization contribution, influenced by its ionic mobility, opening the door to electronic control of its optical response for use in photonics and electro-optics.

Abstract: Time-resolved ultrafast extreme ultraviolet (EUV) magnetic scattering is used to study laser-driven ultrafast magnetization dynamics of labyrinthine domains in a [Co/Ni/Pt] multilayer. Our measurements at the Co and Ni M-edges reveal distinct ultrafast distortions of the scattering pattern position and width for Ni compared to Co. Ni shows a strong modification of the scattering pattern, approximately 10 to 40 times stronger than Co. As distortions of the labyrinthine pattern in reciprocal space relate to the modification of domain textures in real space, significant differences in Co and Ni highlight a 3D distortion of the domain pattern in the far-from-equilibrium regime.

Title: Canonical Thermodynamics
Authors: Arnaldo Spalvieri
Abstract: In the paper, thermodynamics of canonical systems is derived from the multinomial distribution of the occupancy numbers of quantum eigenstates. The cathegorical distribution (i.e. the one-particle distribution) on which the multinomial distribution is based, should be derived from the maximum entropy principle, but, being the multinomial distribution intractable, the paper proposes to take instead the Boltzmann distribution as cathegorical distribution, discussing the reason why the entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution should closely approximate the entropy achieved by the multinomial distribution equipped with the entropy-maximizing cathegorical distribution. After this, the imposition of Clausius' equation on the Shannon entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution leads to an unexpected result: in general, the Lagrange multiplier $\beta$ that imposes the energy constraint in constrained entropy maximization turns out to be substantially different from the inverse temperature. To support this unexpected result, the paper presents an example where, with $\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature, the thermodynamic entropy (i.e. the entropy at a given temperature) of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution is greater than the Bose-Einstein thermodynamic entropy. However, the latter is derived from entropy maximization with constrained expected energy and expected number of particles, therefore if we plug $\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature in the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution, then the thermodynamics of the canonical system obtained in this way turns out to be non-compatible with the principle of maximum entropy.

Title: A Generic Platform for Designing Fractional Chern Insulators: Electrostatically Engineered Rashba Materials
Authors: Bokai Liang, Wei Qin, Zhenyu Zhang
Abstract: We present a generic platform for designing topological flat bands through applying an artificially designed electrostatic superlattice potential to a thin film with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Utilizing many-body exact diagonalization, we show that the lowest flat band can host fractional Chern insulator states at filling factor $n = 1/3$ and $2/3$. Notably, these fractional charge states present robustly in a broad regime of the parameter space. We further discuss the potential realistic materials and the associated experimental conditions required to realize these compelling theoretical predictions. Our findings establish a versatile platform for engineering topological flat bands and exploring topologically nontrivial correlated states.

Title: Site-polarized Mott phases competing with a correlated metal in twisted WSe$_2$
Authors: Siheon Ryee, Lennart Klebl, Gautam Rai, Ammon Fischer, Valentin Crépel, Lede Xian, Angel Rubio, Dante M. Kennes, Roser Valentí, Andrew J. Millis, Antoine Georges, Tim O. Wehling
Abstract: Twisted WSe$_2$ hosts superconductivity, metal-insulator phase transitions, and field-controllable Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid transport properties. In this work, we use dynamical mean-field theory to provide a coherent understanding of the electronic correlations shaping the twisted WSe$_2$ phase diagram. We find a correlated metal competing with three distinct site-polarized correlated insulators; the competition is controlled by interlayer potential difference and interaction strength. The insulators are characterized by a strong differentiation between orbitals with respect to carrier concentration and effective correlation strength. Upon doping, a strong particle-hole asymmetry emerges, resulting from a Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen-type charge-transfer mechanism. The associated charge-transfer physics and proximity to a van Hove singularity in the correlated metal sandwiched between two site-polarized insulators naturally explains the interlayer potential-driven metal-to-insulator transition, particle-hole asymmetry in transport, and the coherence-incoherence crossover in $3.65^\circ$ twisted WSe$_2$.

Title: Quantum-enhanced sensing with variable-range interactions
Authors: Monika Mothsara, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Srijon Ghosh, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: The typical bound on parameter estimation, known as the standard quantum limit (SQL), can be surpassed by exploiting quantum resources such as entanglement. To estimate the magnetic probe field, we propose a quantum sensor based on a variable-range many-body quantum spin chain with a moderate transverse magnetic field. We report the threefold benefits of employing a long-range system as a quantum sensor. First, sensors with quasi-long-range interactions can always beat the SQL for all values of the coordination number, while a sensor with long-range interactions does not have this ubiquitous quantum advantage. Second, a long-range Hamiltonian outperforms a nearest-neighbor (NN) Hamiltonian in terms of both estimating precision and system-size scaling. Finally, we observe that the system with long-range interactions can go below the SQL in the presence of a high temperature of the initial state, while sensors having NN interactions cannot. Furthermore, a sensor based on the long-range Ising Hamiltonian proves to be robust against impurities in the magnetic field and when the time-inhomogeneous dephasing noise acts during interaction of the probe with the system.

Title: Bi-Hamiltonian in Semiflexible Polymer as Strongly Coupled System
Authors: Heeyuen Koh, Shigeo Maruyama
Abstract: The memory effect, which quantifies the interconnection between the target system and its environment, correlates states between distinct Hamiltonians. In this paper, we propose the diffusion process derived from Smoluchowski equation that can manifest the evolution of memory effect integration in non Markovian regime. The master equation from the Smoluchowski picture, within the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics, justifies the use of the diffusion process. The numerical experiments using collision between semiflexible polymers like single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) confirm the derivation and the justification of the usage of the heat diffusion to compensate the correlated momentum between two Hamiltonians that compose coarse grained system of SWCNT. The diffusion process governs the nonlinear motion in both equilibrium and far from equilibrium states.

Title: Scaling and renormalization in high-dimensional regression
Authors: Alexander Atanasov, Jacob A. Zavatone-Veth, Cengiz Pehlevan
Abstract: From benign overfitting in overparameterized models to rich power-law scalings in performance, simple ridge regression displays surprising behaviors sometimes thought to be limited to deep neural networks. This balance of phenomenological richness with analytical tractability makes ridge regression the model system of choice in high-dimensional machine learning. In this paper, we present a unifying perspective on recent results on ridge regression using the basic tools of random matrix theory and free probability, aimed at readers with backgrounds in physics and deep learning. We highlight the fact that statistical fluctuations in empirical covariance matrices can be absorbed into a renormalization of the ridge parameter. This `deterministic equivalence' allows us to obtain analytic formulas for the training and generalization errors in a few lines of algebra by leveraging the properties of the $S$-transform of free probability. From these precise asymptotics, we can easily identify sources of power-law scaling in model performance. In all models, the $S$-transform corresponds to the train-test generalization gap, and yields an analogue of the generalized-cross-validation estimator. Using these techniques, we derive fine-grained bias-variance decompositions for a very general class of random feature models with structured covariates. This allows us to discover a scaling regime for random feature models where the variance due to the features limits performance in the overparameterized setting. We also demonstrate how anisotropic weight structure in random feature models can limit performance and lead to nontrivial exponents for finite-width corrections in the overparameterized setting. Our results extend and provide a unifying perspective on earlier models of neural scaling laws.

Title: Postselection-free approach to monitored quantum dynamics and entanglement phase transitions
Authors: Kim Pöyhönen, Ali G. Moghaddam, Moein N. Ivaki, Teemu Ojanen
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits have stimulated activity in a diverse research community. However, the study of measurement-induced dynamics, due to the requirement of exponentially complex postselection, has been experimentally limited to small or specially designed systems that can be efficiently simulated classically. We present a solution to this outstanding problem by introducing a scalable protocol in $U(1)$ symmetric circuits that facilitates the observation of entanglement phase transitions \emph{directly} from experimental data, without detailed assumptions of the underlying model or benchmarking with simulated data. Thus, the method is applicable to circuits which do not admit efficient classical simulation and allows a reconstruction of the full entanglement entropy curve with minimal theoretical input. Our approach relies on adaptive circuits and a steering protocol to approximate pure-state trajectories with mixed ensembles, from which one can efficiently filter out the subsystem $U(1)$ charge fluctuations of the target trajectory to obtain its entanglement entropy. The steering protocol replaces the exponential costs of postselection and state tomography with a scalable overhead which, for fixed accuracy $\epsilon$ and circuit size $L$, scales as $\mathcal{N}_s\sim L^{5/2}/\epsilon$.

Title: Bacteria optimize tumble bias to strategically navigate surface constraints
Authors: Antai Tao, Guangzhe Liu, Rongjing Zhang, Junhua Yuan
Abstract: In natural environments, solid surfaces present both opportunities and challenges for bacteria. On one hand, they serve as platforms for biofilm formation, crucial for bacterial colonization and resilience in harsh conditions. On the other hand, surfaces can entrap bacteria for extended periods and force them to swim along circular trajectories, constraining their environmental exploration compared to the freedom they experience in the bulk liquid. Here, through systematic single-cell behavioral measurements, phenomenological modeling, and theoretical analysis, we reveal how bacteria strategically navigate these factors. We observe that bacterial surface residence time decreases sharply with increasing tumble bias from zero, transitioning to a plateau at the mean tumble bias of wild-type Escherichia coli (~ 0.25). Furthermore, we find that bacterial surface diffusivity peaks near this mean tumble bias. Considering the phenotypic variation in bacterial tumble bias, which is primarily induced by noise in gene expression, this reflects a strategy for bacterial offspring persistence: In the absence of stimulus cues, some bacteria swiftly escape from the nearby surface in case it lacks nutrients, while others, with longer surface residence times, explore this two-dimensional environment most efficiently to find potential livable sites.

Title: Chaotic and quantum dynamics in driven-dissipative bosonic chains
Authors: Filippo Ferrari, Fabrizio Minganti, Camille Aron, Vincenzo Savona
Abstract: Thermalization in quantum many-body systems typically unfolds over timescales governed by intrinsic relaxation mechanisms. Yet, its spatial aspect is less understood. We investigate this phenomenon in the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a Bose-Hubbard chain subject to coherent driving and dissipation at its boundaries, a setup inspired by current designs in circuit quantum electrodynamics. The dynamical fingerprints of chaos in this NESS are probed using semiclassical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). At intermediate drive strengths, we uncover a two-stage thermalization along the spatial dimension: phase coherence is rapidly lost near the drive, while amplitude relaxation occurs over much longer distances. This separation of scales gives rise to an extended hydrodynamic regime exhibiting anomalous temperature profiles, which we designate as a ``prethermal'' domain. At stronger drives, the system enters a nonthermal, non-chaotic finite-momentum condensate characterized by sub-Poissonian photon statistics and a spatially modulated phase profile, whose stability is undermined by quantum fluctuations. We explore the conditions underlying this protracted thermalization in space and argue that similar mechanisms are likely to emerge in a broad class of extended driven-dissipative systems.

Title: Intrinsic Dimensionality of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou High-Dimensional Trajectories Through Manifold Learning: A Linear Approach
Authors: Gionni Marchetti
Abstract: A data-driven approach based on unsupervised machine learning is proposed to infer the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ of the high-dimensional trajectories of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.

Title: Non-Abelian entanglement asymmetry in random states
Authors: Angelo Russotto, Filiberto Ares, Pasquale Calabrese
Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry measures the extent to which a symmetry is broken within a subsystem of an extended quantum system. Here, we analyse this quantity in Haar random states for arbitrary compact, semi-simple Lie groups, building on and generalising recent results obtained for the $U(1)$ symmetric case. We find that, for any symmetry group, the average entanglement asymmetry vanishes in the thermodynamic limit when the subsystem is smaller than its complement. When the subsystem and its complement are of equal size, the entanglement asymmetry jumps to a finite value, indicating a sudden transition of the subsystem from a fully symmetric state to one devoid of any symmetry. For larger subsystem sizes, the entanglement asymmetry displays a logarithmic scaling with a coefficient fixed by the dimension of the group. We also investigate the fluctuations of the entanglement asymmetry, which tend to zero in the thermodynamic limit. We check our findings against exact numerical calculations for the $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ groups. We further discuss their implications for the thermalisation of isolated quantum systems and black hole evaporation.

Title: From quantum-enhanced to quantum-inspired Monte Carlo
Authors: Johannes Christmann, Petr Ivashkov, Mattia Chiurco, Guglielmo Mazzola
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of the quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo method [Nature, 619, 282-287 (2023)], aimed at identifying the optimal working point of the algorithm. We observe an optimal mixing Hamiltonian strength and analyze the scaling of the total evolution time with the size of the system. We also explore extensions of the circuit, including the use of time-dependent Hamiltonians and reverse digitized annealing. Additionally, we propose that classical, approximate quantum simulators can be used for the proposal step instead of the original real-hardware implementation. We observe that tensor-network simulators, even with unconverged settings, can maintain a scaling advantage over standard classical samplers. This may extend the utility of quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo as a quantum-inspired algorithm, even before the deployment of large-scale quantum hardware.

Title: Enhancing Dynamic Range of Sub-Quantum-Limit Measurements via Quantum Deamplification
Authors: Qi Liu, Ming Xue, Matthew Radzihovsky, Xinwei Li, Denis V. Vasilyev, Ling-Na Wu, Vladan Vuletić
Abstract: Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large dynamic range is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends dynamic range at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of dynamic range is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.

Title: Fundamental thresholds for computational and erasure errors via the coherent information
Authors: Luis Colmenarez, Seyong Kim, Markus Müller
Abstract: Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information against environmental noise. Computational errors caused by the environment change the quantum state within the qubit subspace, whereas quantum erasures correspond to the loss of qubits at known positions. Correcting either type of error involves different correction mechanisms, which makes studying the interplay between erasure and computational errors particularly challenging. In this work, we propose a framework based on the coherent information (CI) of the mixed-state density operator associated to noisy QEC codes, for treating both types of errors together. We show how to rigorously derive different families of statistical mechanics mappings for generic stabilizer QEC codes in the presence of both types of errors. Further, we show that computing the CI for erasure errors only can be done efficiently upon sampling over erasure configurations. We then test our approach on the 2D toric and color codes and compute optimal thresholds for erasure errors only, finding a 50 percent threshold for both codes. This strengthens the notion that both codes share the same optimal thresholds. When considering both computational and erasure errors, the CI of small-size codes yields thresholds in very accurate agreement with established results that have been obtained in the thermodynamic limit. Next, we perform a similar analysis for a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, the lift-connected surface code. We find a 50 percent threshold under erasure errors alone and, for the first time, derive the exact statistical mechanics mappings in the presence of both computational and erasure errors. We thereby further establish the CI as a practical tool for studying optimal thresholds for code classes beyond topological codes under realistic noise, and as a means for uncovering new relations between QEC codes and statistical physics models.

Title: A topology optimisation framework to design test specimens for one-shot identification or discovery of material models
Authors: Saeid Ghouli, Moritz Flaschel, Siddhant Kumar, Laura De Lorenzis
Abstract: The increasing availability of full-field displacement data from imaging techniques in experimental mechanics is determining a gradual shift in the paradigm of material model calibration and discovery, from using several simple-geometry tests towards a few, or even one single test with complicated geometry. The feasibility of such a "one-shot" calibration or discovery heavily relies upon the richness of the measured displacement data, i.e., their ability to probe the space of the state variables and the stress space (whereby the stresses depend on the constitutive law being sought) to an extent sufficient for an accurate and robust calibration or discovery process. The richness of the displacement data is in turn directly governed by the specimen geometry. In this paper, we propose a density-based topology optimisation framework to optimally design the geometry of the target specimen for calibration of an anisotropic elastic material model. To this end, we perform automatic, high-resolution specimen design by maximising the robustness of the solution of the inverse problem, i.e., the identified material parameters, given noisy displacement measurements from digital image correlation. We discuss the choice of the cost function and the design of the topology optimisation framework, and we analyse a range of optimised topologies generated for the identification of isotropic and anisotropic elastic responses.

Title: The tricritical Ising CFT and conformal bootstrap
Authors: Johan Henriksson
Abstract: The tricritical Ising CFT is the IR fixed-point of $\lambda\phi^6$ theory. It can be seen as a one-parameter family of CFTs connecting between an $\varepsilon$-expansion near the upper critical dimension 3 and the exactly solved minimal model in $d=2$. We review what is known about the tricritical Ising CFT, and study it with the numerical conformal bootstrap for various dimensions. Using a mixed system with three external operators $\{\phi\sim\sigma,\phi^2\sim \epsilon,\phi^3\sim\sigma'\}$, we find three-dimensional "bootstrap islands" in $d=2.75$ and $d=2.5$ dimensions consistent with interpolations between the perturbative estimates and the 2d exact values. In $d=2$ and $d=2.25$ the setup is not strong enough to isolate the theory. This paper also contains a survey of the perturbative spectrum and a review of results from the literature.

Title: Three-dimensional chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for helical motion of microorganisms
Authors: Leon Lettermann, Falko Ziebert, Mirko Singer, Friedrich Frischknecht, Ulrich S. Schwarz (Heidelberg University)
Abstract: Active movement is essential for the survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae and unicellular parasites. In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. One such case are malaria parasites gliding through 3D hydrogels, for which we find that their internal correlation time is similar to the time taken for one helical turn. Motivated by this experimental finding, here we theoretically analyze the case of finite internal correlation time for microorganisms with helical trajectories as chiral active particles with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for torque. We present an analytical solution which is in very good agreement with computer simulations. We then show that for this type of internal noise, chirality and rotation increase the persistence of motion and results in helical trajectories that have a larger long-time mean squared displacement than straight trajectories at the same propulsion speed. Finally we provide experimental evidence for this prediction for the case of the malaria parasites.

Title: Distribution of singular values in large sample cross-covariance matrices
Authors: Arabind Swain, Sean Alexander Ridout, Ilya Nemenman
Abstract: For two large matrices ${\mathbf X}$ and ${\mathbf Y}$ with Gaussian i.i.d.\ entries and dimensions $T\times N_X$ and $T\times N_Y$, respectively, we derive the probability distribution of the singular values of $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{Y}$ in different parameter regimes. This extends the Marchenko-Pastur result for the distribution of eigenvalues of empirical sample covariance matrices to singular values of empirical cross-covariances. Our results will help to establish statistical significance of cross-correlations in many data-science applications.

Title: Mixed-state geometric phases of coherent and squeezed spin states
Authors: Xin Wang, Jia-Chen Tang, Xu-Yang Hou, Hao Guo, Chih-Chun Chien
Abstract: Two mixed-state geometric phases, known as the Uhlmann phase and interferometric geometric phase (IGP), of spin coherent states (CSSs) and spin squeezed states (SSSs) are analyzed. Exact solutions and numerical results of selected examples are presented. For the $j = 3/2$ CSS, the Uhlmann phase exhibits finite-temperature topological phase transitions characterized by abrupt jumps. The IGP for the same state similarly shows discontinuous jumps as the temperature varies. In the case of the $j = 1$ one-axis SSS, both Uhlmann phase and IGP display discrete finite-temperature jumps. By contrast, the $j = 1$ two-axis SSS shows no such transitions because the Uhlmann phase and IGP both vary smoothly with temperature. We also briefly discuss potential realizations and simulations related to these phenomena in spin systems.

Title: Gauge freedoms in unravelled quantum dynamics: When do different continuous measurements yield identical quantum trajectories?
Authors: Calum A. Brown, Katarzyna Macieszczak, Robert L. Jack
Abstract: Quantum trajectories of a Markovian open quantum system arise from the back-action of measurements performed in the environment with which the system interacts. In this work, we consider counting measurements of quantum jumps, corresponding to different representations of the same quantum master equation. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which these different measurements give rise to the same unravelled quantum master equation, which governs the dynamics of the probability distribution over pure conditional states of the system. Since that equation uniquely determines the stochastic dynamics of a conditional state, we also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions under which different measurements result in identical quantum trajectories. We then consider the joint stochastic dynamics for the conditional state and the measurement record. We formulate this in terms of labelled quantum trajectories, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which different representations lead to equivalent labelled quantum trajectories, up to permutations of labels. As those conditions are generally stricter, we finish by constructing coarse-grained measurement records, such that equivalence of the corresponding partially-labelled trajectories is guaranteed by equivalence of the trajectories alone. These general results are illustrated by two examples that demonstrate permutation of labels, and equivalence of different quantum trajectories.

Title: Multiparticle Collision Dynamics Simulations of the Flagellar Apparatus in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
Authors: Sai Venkata Ramana Ambadipudi, Albert Bae, Azam Gholami
Abstract: Using multiparticle collision dynamics simulations, we investigate the swimming dynamics, orientational behavior, and hydrodynamic interactions of a model swimmer designed to mimic the isolated flagellar apparatus ($FA$) of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We represent the $FA$ as a chain of monomers connected by elastic springs, with two traveling waves originating at its center and propagating in opposite directions along the chain. Our simulations show that an $FA$ whose beat pattern has non-zero mean curvature sustains ballistic motion for several hundred beats before transitioning to a diffusion-dominated regime via rotational diffusion. In contrast, a flagellar apparatus with zero mean curvature ($FA_0$) -- generates mirror-symmetric deformations and fails to achieve net propulsion. Both the active $FA$ and $FA_0$ exhibit orientational autocorrelation functions that decay exponentially -- matching those of their inactive counterparts -- indicating that active beating does not influence the FA's rotational diffusion. Driving the two flagellar arms at different frequencies reproduces the epitrochoid-like trajectory observed experimentally. Finally, hydrodynamic interactions between two $FA$s give rise to co-moving bound pairs in either parallel or antiparallel configurations, with their stability governed by the phase difference of the curvature waves. Together, our results establish a versatile model microswimmer with tunable dynamics -- offering a blueprint for the rational design of artificial, flagella-driven microswimmers.

Title: Probing Quantum Spin Systems with Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network Quantum States
Authors: Mahmud Ashraf Shamim, Eric A F Reinhardt, Talal Ahmed Chowdhury, Sergei Gleyzer, Paulo T Araujo
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ansätze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) \textit{a.k.a.} Feed Forward Neural Networks, when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.

Title: Large-scale quantization of trace I: Finite propagation operators
Authors: Matthias Ludewig, Guo Chuan Thiang
Abstract: Inspired by parallel developments in coarse geometry in mathematics and exact macroscopic quantization in physics, we present a family of general trace formulae which are universally quantized and depend only on large-scale geometric features of the input data. They generalize, to arbitrary dimensions, formulae found by Roe in his partitioned manifold index theorem, as well as the Kubo and Kitaev formulae for 2D Hall conductance used in physics.

Title: InGaN Nanopixel Arrays on Single Crystal GaN Substrate

Abstract: Indium gallium nitride (InGaN) quantum well (QW) micro- and nanoscale light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are promising for next-generation ultrafast optical interconnects and augmented/virtual reality displays. However, scaling to nanoscale dimensions presents significant challenges, including enhanced nonradiative surface recombination, defect and/or dislocation-related emission degradation and nanoscale pixel contact formation. In this work, we demonstrate strain-engineered nanoscale blue LED pixels fabricated via top-down nanostructuring of an all-InGaN quantum well/barrier heterostructure grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) on significantly low dislocation-density single-crystal GaN substrates. Sidewall passivation using atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 enables excellent diode behavior, including a high rectification ratio and extremely low reverse leakage. Monte Carlo analyses suggest almost 100% yield of completely dislocation-free active regions for 450 nm nanopixels. Electroluminescence measurements show bright blue emission with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.46%. Poisson Schrodinger simulations reveal partial strain relaxation in the QW, effectively mitigating the quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE). Additionally, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations confirm that the nanoscale geometry enhances light extraction efficiency by over 40% compared to planar designs, independent of substrate materials. These results establish a scalable pathway for dislocation free, high-brightness InGaN microLED arrays suitable for advanced display and photonic systems.

Title: Connecting phases of matter to the flatness of the loss landscape in analog variational quantum algorithms
Authors: Kasidit Srimahajariyapong, Supanut Thanasilp, Thiparat Chotibut
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ansätze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ansätze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ansätze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.

Title: Nanoscale imaging of reduced forward bias at V-pits in green-emitting nitride LEDs
Authors: C. Fornos, N. ALyabyeva, Y. W. Ho, J. Peretti, A. C. H. Rowe, J. S. Speck, T. Tak, C. Weisbuch
Abstract: Record wall-plug efficiencies in long-wavelength, nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have recently been achieved in devices containing high V-pit densities. Numerical modeling suggests this may be due to improved electrical efficiencies (EE). In order to test this proposition, a novel scanning tunneling luminescence microscope (STLM) is used to map the local optoelectronic properties of commercial, green-emitting LED heterostructures around V-pits with nanoscale spatial resolution. Using the STLM tip as the hole injector, injection at the lips of V-pits is found to be drastically different from injection on the heterostructure's c-plane. A $\approx$ 3-fold improvement in internal quantum efficiency near V-pits is observed at low injection, and at higher injection a $\approx$ 1.2 V reduction in the forward bias unambiguously confirms the EE hypothesis for hole injection.

Title: Entropy from scattering in weakly interacting systems
Authors: Duncan MacIntyre, Gordon W. Semenoff
Abstract: Perturbation theory is used to investigate the evolution of the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem of a bipartite quantum system in the course of a gedanken scattering experiment. We find surprisingly simple criteria for the initial state and the scattering matrix that guarantee that the subsystem entropy increases. The class of states that meet these criteria are more correlated than simple product states of the subsystems. They form a subclass of the set of all separable states, and they can therefore be assembled by classical processes alone.

Authors: Uri Cohen
Abstract: The Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse $X^\dagger$, defined for rectangular matrices, naturally emerges in many areas of mathematics and science. For a pair of rectangular matrices $X, Y$ where the corresponding entries are jointly Gaussian and i.i.d., we analyse the support of the eigenvalue spectrum of $XY^\dagger$.

Title: Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK
Authors: Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez
Abstract: Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.
