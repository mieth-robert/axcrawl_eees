Title: Non-equilibrium Capacitance Loss in EDLC Based on Ion Flux
Authors: Jia Li, Xinyu Zhang, Wei Wu
Abstract: Understanding the loss of non-equilibrium capacitance in the electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) during continuous charging compared to equilibrium capacitance is crucial for the design of high-rate energy storage devices. Due to three major challenges, including strong ion correlations induced by high concentrations at the interface, the difficulty in representing far from equilibrium, and numerical stability issues, current numerical simulations of ion distribution based on statistical mechanics struggle to achieve long-term accurate modeling under realistic parameters. Since non-equilibrium capacitance loss is a universal macroscopic phenomenon in EDLC, which exists independently of the microscopic model of the electrolyte, this study starts from macroscopic non-equilibrium phenomena, introduces a novel perspective centered on ion flux (IF) for the first time. By deriving the relationship among the charging current, IF, and displacement current, a novel capacitance model based on IF is first established. It is further demonstrated that the current relationship and voltage relationship of EDLC, when represented by conventional circuit models, exhibit inherent contradictions. Therefore, a new interpretative framework is proposed, wherein IF and displacement current are analogized to acceleration and deformation in an elastic medium, respectively. Inspired by this insight, this study reveals that the decrease in non-equilibrium capacitance with increasing charging current originates from the inherent resistance of IF to external charging. This tendency to restore equilibrium is the fundamental cause of non-equilibrium capacitance loss.

Title: An improved peridynamic framework to eliminate unphysical stress and fictitious yield at geometry surface for geomaterials elastoplastic deformation and fracture analysis
Authors: Yixin Li, Xueyu Geng
Abstract: This paper presents an improved non-ordinary state-based peridynamics (NOSB PD) framework for modelling the elastoplastic behaviour and damage of geomaterials, such as soil, rock, and concrete, under quasi static conditions. Conventional NOSB PD for elastoplastic materials faces two primary challenges: the surface effect due to the low accuracy of the approximate deformation gradient (FPD) near boundaries and fictitious yielding during explicit time integration. These issues can lead to numerical errors, such as inaccurate crack predictions and potential simulation failure. The proposed framework thoroughly analyses the reason for the surface effect by demonstrating that FPD exhibits only first order accuracy within a horizon radius (delta) from the surface but introduces residual stresses within a larger range of 2 delta with significant surface effect. To mitigate this, a divergence formulation of the non-local differential operator (NDO) is applied to enforce a reasonable stress gradient within a 2 delta subregion, alongside a traction boundary condition consistent with the divergence of stress. Additionally, a loading balance correction algorithm is introduced to enhance the conventional explicit time integration process. The model is validated by integrating it with a modified hyperbolic-hardening Drucker-Prager model, where the stress integration is performed using the closest point projection method (CMMP). Numerical results, compared with finite element simulations and experimental data, demonstrate the effective elimination of the surface effect and false yielding, providing a robust simulation of elastoplastic deformation and progressive failure in geomaterials.

Title: A quantum monomer-dimer model on Penrose tilings
Authors: Jeet Shah, Gautam Nambiar, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Victor Galitski
Abstract: We define a quantum monomer-dimer model in the space of maximal dimer coverings of quasicrystalline Penrose tilings. Since Penrose tilings do not admit perfect dimer coverings, as shown by F. Flicker et al., PRX 10, 011005 (2020), monomers are necessarily present in our model. The model features a frustration-free Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point where the ground state is a uniform superposition of all the exponentially many maximal dimer coverings, despite the presence of a finite density of monomers. We map our model to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with matter and calculate various correlators to characterize the phase of the system at the RK point using classical Monte Carlo calculations. Specifically, we compute the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators, as well as open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops corresponding to the monomers and the visons. We find that both the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators decay exponentially with distance. The open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops decay exponentially with the same correlation length, indicating that the gauge theory is in the confined phase, which implies that the system is likely in an ordered phase.

Title: Reallocation of Nonlocal Entanglement in Incommensurate Cold Atom Arrays
Authors: Jemin Park, Junmo Jeon, SungBin Lee
Abstract: Cold atom arrays in optical lattices offer a highly tunable platform for exploring complex quantum phenomena that are difficult to realize in conventional materials. Here, we investigate the emergence of controllable long-range quantum correlations in a simulated twisted bilayer structure with fermionic cold atoms. By exploiting the incommensurate nature of the twisted bilayer, we observe a significant enhancement of long-range susceptibility, suggesting the formation of stable entangled states between spatially distant localized spins. We further show that the tunability of the interlayer coupling in terms of driving fields enables us to manipulate these entangled states without deformation of lattice structure and extra doping. Our findings provide a pathway for overcoming challenges in establishing strong correlations across distant sites, highlighting the potential of optical lattices as a versatile platform for advanced quantum technologies.

Title: Josephson effect in strongly disordered metallic wires
Authors: Mustafa E. Ismagambetov, Aleksey V. Lunkin, Pavel M. Ostrovsky
Abstract: We study localization effects in Josephson junctions with two superconductors connected by a strongly disordered metallic wire of length $L$. The conventional description of the Josephson effect in such systems, based on the quasiclassical Usadel equation, neglects electron interference and is only applicable when $L$ is shorter than the localization length $\xi$ in the wire. We develop a more general theory for the Josephson effect using the non-linear sigma model that fully accounts for electron interference, and hence localization. We show that for $L \gg \xi$, three qualitatively different regimes of the Josephson current arise depending on the ratio of the superconducting order parameter $\Delta$ and the mean level spacing in the localization volume $\Delta_\xi$. We derive the average supercurrent as a function of the phase difference for all three regimes. Quite unexpectedly, we observe that the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation between the average critical current and the normal-state conductance still holds in the strongly localized state when $\Delta_\xi \gg \Delta$ and $\xi \ll L \ll (\xi/\pi^2) \ln^2(\Delta_\xi/\Delta)$.

Title: Robust trapping of 2D excitons in an engineered 1D potential from proximal ferroelectric domain walls
Authors: Pedro Soubelet, Yao Tong, Asier Astaburuaga Hernandez, Peirui Ji, Katia Gallo, Andreas V. Stier, Jonathan J. Finley
Abstract: We investigate the confinement of neutral excitons in a one-dimensional (1D) potential, engineered by proximizing hBN-encapsulated monolayer MoSe$_2$ to ferroelectric domain walls (DW) in periodically poled LiNbO$_3$. Our device exploits the nanometer scale in-plane electric field gradient at the DW to induce the dipolar exciton confinement via the Stark effect. Spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy reveals the emergence of narrow emission lines redshifted from the MoSe$_2$ neutral exciton by up to $\sim100\,$meV, depending on the sample structure. The spatial distribution, excitation energy response and polarization properties of the emission is consistent with signatures of 1D-confined excitons. The large electric field gradients accessible via proximal ferroelectric systems open up new avenues for the creation of robust quantum-confined excitons in atomically thin materials and their heterostructures.

Title: Interfacial Cavitation with Surface Tension: New Insights into Failure of Particle Reinforced Polymers
Authors: Xuanhe Li, Brendan Unikewicz, S. Chockalingam, Hudson Borja da Rocha, Tal Cohen
Abstract: Understanding and mitigating the failure of reinforced elastomers has been a long-standing challenge in many industrial applications. In an early attempt to shed light on the fundamental mechanisms of failure, Gent and Park presented a systematic experimental study examining the field that develops near rigid beads that are embedded in the material and describe two distinct failure phenomena: cavitation that occurs near the bead in the bulk of the material, and debonding at the bead-rubber interface [Gent, A.N. and Park, B., 1984. Journal of Materials Science, 19, pp.1947-1956]. Although the interpretation of their results has not been challenged, several questions stemming from their work remain unresolved -- specifically, the reported dependence of the cavitation stress on the diameter of the bead and the counterintuitive relationship between the delamination threshold and the material stiffness. In this work, we revisit the work of Gent and Park and consider an alternative explanation of their observations, interfacial cavitation. A numerically validated semi-analytical model shows that in presence of surface tension, defects at the bead-rubber interface may be prone to cavitate at lower pressures compared to bulk cavitation, and that surface tension can explain the reported length-scale effects. A phase-map portrays the distinct regions of `cavitation dominated' and `delamination dominated' failure and confirms that for the expected range of material properties of the rubbers used by Gent and Park, interfacial cavitation is a likely explanation. Crucially, this result offers a new avenue to tune and optimize the performance of reinforced polymers and other multi-material systems.

Title: Crosscap states with tunable entanglement as exact eigenstates of local spin chain Hamiltonians
Authors: Márton Mestyán, Balázs Pozsgay
Abstract: It has been observed recently that various spin chain Hamiltonians admit special zero energy "crosscap" eigenstates. These states are made up of maximally entangled Bell pairs prepared on antipodal sites of a periodic chain. We generalize the states by allowing the antipodal pairs to have non-maximal, tunable entanglement. We give sufficient conditions for such states to be exact zero energy eigenstates of a local Hamiltonian. The conditions are naturally satisfied in many models which have a global U(1) symmetry. These models include well known integrable models such as the XX model, the Bariev model, the folded XXZ model, and also a variety of non-integrable models. Using the zero-energy crosscap states we also derive a family of exact zero modes with sub-volume law entanglement.

Title: Tailoring the Electronic Structure of Ni(111) by Alloying with Sb Ad-Atoms
Authors: Anna Cecilie Åsland, Alv Johan Skarpeid, Matthias Hartl, Marte Stalsberg, Adrian N. Rørheim, Johannes Bakkelund, Jinbang Hu, Zheshen Li, Simon P. Cooil, Justin W. Wells, Håkon I. Røst
Abstract: Surface alloying can alter surface electronic and magnetic properties, which are key parameters when developing new materials tailored for specific applications. A magnetic surface alloy was formed by depositing Sb on Ni(111) at elevated temperatures, yielding new electronic states at the Fermi level and modifying the Ni-derived bandstructure. In particular, it changed the electron occupancy of the spin-polarized surface resonance bands, which may affect the magnetic properties of the surface and its associated many-body effects. By fitting a finite element model to angle-dependent core level measurements, similar amounts of Sb and Ni were found within the first few atomic layers to indicate a near-surface composition similar to the bulk alloy NiSb. Annealing to higher temperatures post-growth further improved the crystalline quality of the surface. Our investigation of the surface alloy's crystallinity, chemical composition, and layer structure lays the basis for future studies of how its electronic and magnetic properties can be modified.

Title: Schmid-Higgs Mode in the Presence of Pair-Breaking Interactions
Authors: Maxim Dzero, Alex Kamenev
Abstract: Collective modes in superconductors provided the first realization of the Higgs mechanism. The transverse Goldstone mode acquires a gap (i.e. a mass) when it hybridizes with the electromagnetic gauge field. The longitudinal Schmid-Higgs mode, on the other hand, is always massive. In conventional BCS theory, its gap is exactly $2\Delta$, coinciding with the excitation threshold for quasiparticles. Being situated right at the edge of the continuum spectrum it gives rise to peculiar dynamics for the Schmid-Higgs mode. For instance, when suddenly excited at $t=0$, it exhibits algebraically decaying oscillations of the form $\sim \sin(2\Delta t)/{t}^{1/2}$. In this study, we explore the behavior of Schmid-Higgs oscillations in the presence of pair-breaking mechanisms, such as magnetic impurities or in-plane magnetic fields. These processes suppress the quasiparticle excitation threshold down to $2\varepsilon_g < 2\Delta$, potentially placing the longitudinal mode within the continuum spectrum. Despite this, we show that the algebraically decaying oscillations persist, taking the form $\sim \sin(2\varepsilon_g t)/t^2$. The Schmid-Higgs mode becomes truly overdamped and exponentially decaying only in the gapless superconductors with $\varepsilon_g=0$.

Title: Planckian dissipation, anomalous high temperature THz non-linear response and energy relaxation in the strange metal state of the cuprate superconductors
Authors: Dipanjan Chaudhuri, David Barbalas, Fahad Mahmood, Jiahao Liang, Ralph Romero III, Anaelle Legros, Xi He, Helene Raffy, Ivan Bozovic, N.P. Armitage
Abstract: We have investigated the nonlinear THz 2D coherent spectroscopic response of superconducting La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) thin films as a function of $T$ across a wide range of doping levels from mildly underdoped through extremely overdoped ($T_c < 5$ K). In addition to the large nonlinearities expected in the superconducting state, we find an extended regime of large normal state THz nonlinearity. This is in sharp contrast to the conventional superconductor NbN where the strong nonlinear response promptly disappears at $T_c$. The size of the nonlinear susceptibility in LSCO is $|\chi^{(3)}|\approx 2.2\times10^{-9} m^2/V^2$, which is one of the largest THz range nonlinearities ever measured. The 2DCS measurement shows that the dominant normal state nonlinearities arise from pump-probe processes, of which there are various possible origins. These may be related to the unconventional interactions that lead to the strange metal or the persistence of superconducting correlations to high temperatures. Irrespective of its origin, the large normal state nonlinearity provides an opportunity to measure the energy relaxation rate ($\Gamma_E$) to temperatures where the momentum relaxation rate is linear in T and close to its ``Planckian" form ($\Gamma_M \approx 2kT/h$). We find $\Gamma_E$ to be $10 - 40$ times smaller than the momentum relaxation. This shows that the scattering that causes momentum loss (and $T$-linear) resistivity do not remove appreciable energy from the electrons. Although the $T$-dependence of the momentum relaxation is consistent with quasi-elastic scattering off bosonic collective modes at temperatures above their characteristic energy (the Bloch-Gruneisen temperature for acoustic phonons) it is inconsistent with $\Gamma_E$'s temperature dependence. $\Gamma_E$ is an increasing function of $T$, which is indicative of {\it inelastic} scattering to the phonon bath.

Title: Functionalized Cr$_2$C MXenes: Novel Magnetic Semiconductors
Authors: Yogendra Limbu, Hari Paudyal, Eudes Gomes da Silva, Denis R. Candido, Michael E. Flatté, Durga Paudyal
Abstract: We report an \textit{ab initio} investigation of functionalized and 3$d$-electrons doped Cr$_2$C MXenes. Upon functionalization, the Cr$_2$C becomes chemically, dynamically, and mechanically stable, and it exhibits magnetic semiconducting behavior. Cr$_2$CF$_2$ stands out as a wide band gap semiconductor, possessing super exchange interaction mediated by F atoms within the layer, however, the applied strain transforms it from an indirect to a direct band gap semiconductor. Strong spin-phonon coupling found in Cr$_2$CH$_2$ is supported by the distorted Cr spin density due to hydrogen environment. Two magnon branches, associated with two sub-lattice spins, are found in the ferromagnetic Cr$_2$CO$_2$ and antiferromagnetic Cr$_2$CF$_2$. Depending on the types of 3$d$-electron dopants and functionalization, Cr$_2$C MXenes (except for Cr$_2$CO$_2$) change from the indirect band gap magnetic semiconductor to different states of electronic and magnetic matter including exotic direct band gap magnetic bipolar semiconductor. In addition, we reveal a band inversion between the two highest valence bands in the Fe-doped Cr$_2$CCl$_2$.

Title: Phase transitions and finite-size effects in integrable virial statistical models
Authors: Xin An, Francesco Giglio, Giulio Landolfi
Abstract: We analyze thermodynamic models for fluid systems in equilibrium based on a virial expansion of the internal energy in terms of the volume density. We prove that the models, formulated for finite-size systems with $N$ particles, are exactly solvable to any expansion order, as expectation values of physical observables (e.g., volume density) are determined from solutions to nonlinear C-integrable PDEs of hydrodynamic type. In the limit $N\to\infty$, phase transitions emerge as classical shock waves in the space of thermodynamic variables. Near critical points, we argue that the volume density exhibits a scaling behavior consistent with the Universality Conjecture in viscous transport PDEs. As an application, we employ our framework to nuclear matter and construct a global QCD phase diagram revealing critical points for the nuclear liquid-gas and hadron gas-QGP transitions. We demonstrate how finite-size effects smear critical signatures, indicating the importance of thoughtful considerations in the search for the QCD critical point.

Title: Transient Chirality in the Gelation of Adhesive Spinner Monolayers
Authors: Yujie Jiang, Yiting Liu, Haoran Li, Yang Cui
Abstract: Active systems of self-rotating elements inherently exhibit chirality, making them of fundamental interest due to parity violation. Using large-scale hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the gelation of adhesive spinners confined to quasi-2D monolayers at low Reynolds numbers. Unlike the coarsening dynamics of passive colloids, spinner gelation follows a different pathway, displaying structural chirality during the early stages of aggregation. However, this chirality dissipates upon dynamical arrest, resulting in a final gel structure that resembles a conventional colloidal gel. As a result, we find no sign of odd mechanical responses. Nonetheless, the elastic modulus and gelation time remain tunable through spinning activity, providing a new avenue for the bottom-up design of programmable soft materials.

Title: Collapse of the standard ferromagnetic domain structure in hybrid Co/Molecule bilayers

Alek Dediu
Abstract: We show that, upon the chemisorption of organic molecules, Co thin films display a number of unique magnetic properties, including the giant magnetic hardening and the violation of the Rayleigh law in magnetization reversal. These novel properties originate from the modification of the surface magnetic anisotropy induced by the molecule/film interaction: the {\pi}-d molecule/metal hybridization modifies the orbital population of the associated cobalt atoms and induces an additional and randomly oriented local anisotropy. Strong effects arise when the induced surface anisotropy is correlated over scales of a few molecules, and particularly when the correlation length of the random anisotropy field is comparable to the characteristic exchange length. This leads to the collapse of the standard domain structure and to the emergency of a glassy-type ferromagnetic state, defined by blurred pseudo-domains intertwined by diffuse and irregular domain walls. The magnetization reversal in such state was predicted to include topological vortex-like structures, successfully measured in this research by magnetic-force microscopy. Our work shows how the strong electronic interaction of standard components, Co thin films and readily available molecules, can generate structures with remarkable new magnetic properties, and thus opens a new avenue for the design of tailored-on-demand magnetic composites.

Title: Collecting Particles in Confined Spaces by Active Filamentous Matter
Authors: R. Sinaasappel, K.R.Prathyusha, H. Tuazon, E.Mirzahossein, P.Illien, S. Bhamla, A.Deblais
Abstract: The potential of compliant and adaptable active matter for particle transport presents a promising avenue for the development of efficient, autonomous systems. However, achieving optimal task efficiency often depends on external control mechanisms, which can limit the autonomy of such systems. In this study, we draw inspiration from Tubifex tubifex and Lumbriculus variegatus, centimeter-sized worms that exhibit an extraordinary ability to aggregate dispersed particles within confined environments. By observing their natural behaviors, we identify a simple yet effective particle collection strategy driven by flexibility and activity. Using these biological insights, we develop larger-scale robotic systems and simulations that replicate the particle aggregation dynamics of living worms. Our results reveal that coupling between activity and flexibility governs the efficiency of particle clustering, and this principle applies universally across biological, robotic, and simulated filaments. These results allow us to offer new particle collection strategies by tuning the design elements like topology or bending stiffness of soft active filaments.

Title: A theory of quasiballistic spin transport
Authors: Jeffrey Song, Hyunsoo Ha, Wen Wei Ho, Vir B. Bulchandani
Abstract: A recent work [Mierzejewski et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 045134 (2023)] observed "quasiballistic spin transport" - long-lived and transiently ballistic modes of the magnetization density - in numerical simulations of infinite-temperature XXZ chains with power-law exchange interactions. We develop an analytical theory of such quasiballistic spin transport. Previous work found that this effect was maximized along a specific locus in the space of model parameters, which interpolated smoothly between the integrable Haldane-Shastry and XX models and whose shape was estimated from numerics. We obtain an analytical estimate for the lifetime of the spin current and show that it has a unique maximum along a different locus, which interpolates more gradually between the two integrable points. We further rule out the existence of a conserved two-body operator that protects ballistic spin transport away from these integrable points by proving that a corresponding functional equation has no solutions. We discuss connections between our approach and an integrability-transport conjecture for spin.

Title: Diverse electronic topography in a distorted kagome metal LaTi3Bi4
Authors: Anup Pradhan Sakhya, Brenden R. Ortiz, Barun Ghosh, Milo Sprague, Mazharul Islam Mondal, Matthew Matzelle, Nabil Atlam, Arun K Kumay, David G. Mandrus, Jonathan D. Denlinger, Arun Bansil, Madhab Neupane
Abstract: Recent reports on a family of kagome metals of the form LnTi3Bi4 (Ln = Lanthanide) has stoked interest due to the combination of highly anisotropic magnetism and a rich electronic structure. The electronic structure near the Fermi level is proposed to exhibit Dirac points and van Hove singularities. In this manuscript, we use angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements in combination with density functional theory calculations to investigate the electronic structure of a newly discovered kagome metal LaTi3Bi4. Our results reveal multiple van Hove singularities (VHSs) with one VHS located in the vicinity of the Fermi level. We clearly observe two flat bands, which originate from the destructive interference of wave functions within the Ti kagome motif. These flat bands and VHSs originate from Ti d orbitals and are very responsive to the polarization of the incident beam. We notice a significant anisotropy in the electronic structure, resulting from the breaking of six fold rotational symmetry in this material. Our findings demonstrate this new family of Ti based kagome material as a promising platform to explore novel emerging phenomena in the wider LnTi3Bi4 (Ln= lanthanide) family of materials.

Title: Angular Interplay of Nematicity, Superconductivity, and Strange Metallicity in a Moiré Flat Band
Authors: Naiyuan J. Zhang, Pavel A. Nosov, Ophelia Evelyn Sommer, Yibang Wang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Eslam Khalaf, J.I.A. Li
Abstract: Superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems frequently exhibits broken rotational symmetry, raising fundamental questions about the underlying order parameter symmetry. In this work, we demonstrate that electronic nematicity--driven by Coulomb-mediated rotational symmetry breaking--serves as a crucial link to understanding the nature of superconductivity. Utilizing a novel framework of angle-resolved measurement, we reveal an interring angular interplay among nematicity, superconductivity, and strange metallicity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene. By establishing a direct correlation between the preferred superconducting transport direction and the principal axis of the metallic phase, our findings place strong constrains on the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. This work introduces a new paradigm for probing the microscopic mechanisms governing superconductivity in strongly interacting two-dimensional systems.

Title: Low-lying Electronic Structure of Rare-Earth Based Topological Nodal Line Semimetal Candidate DySbTe
Authors: Nathan Valadez, Iftakhar Bin Elius, Dante James, Peter Radanovich, Tetiana Romanova, Sami Elgalal, Grzegorz Chajewski, Florie Mesple, Ellis Thompson, Keng Tou Chu, Matthew Yankowitz, Andrzej Ptok, Dariusz Kaczorowski, Madhab Neupane
Abstract: Lanthanide (Ln) based LnSbTe materials have garnered significant attention due to rich interplay of long range magnetic ordering and topological properties, driven by unique crystalline symmetry, 4f electron interactions, and pronounced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects. DySbTe, as a heavier lanthanide-based member of the LnSbTe family, stands out with its SOC and larger on site interactions on its 4f electrons, which arise due to the heavier Dy element. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the low-temperature bulk physical properties and the electronic structure of DySbTe using magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and electrical resistivity measurements, along with high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S), and density functional theory calculations. Our thermodynamic measurements revealed an antiferromagnetic ordering below TN = 7.45 K and a subsequent magnetic phase transition at TN1 = 7.15 K. Our transport studies indicate a semimetallic behavior with unusual feature in the ordered state. Our ARPES measurements revealed a diamond-shaped Fermi pocket centered at the G point, with band features that evolve distinctly across various binding energies. STM/S results indicate a minimum in the density of states at around 100 meV below the Fermi level, and ARPES measurements reveal a significant gap present around the X point, differentiating DySbTe from other LnSbTe compounds. These findings enhance our understanding of the SOC effects on the electronic structure and topological properties in the LnSbTe family, highlighting DySbTe as a promising candidate for exploring the interplay between topology and magnetism.

Title: High-throughput Discovery of Anti-gap Semiconductors
Authors: Zeyu Xiang, Fanghao Zhang, Bolin Liao
Abstract: Conventional semiconductors typically have bonding states near the valence band maximum (VBM) and antibonding states near the conduction band minimum (CBM). Semiconductors with the opposite electronic configuration, namely an antibonding VBM and a bonding CBM, are here termed ``anti-gap semiconductors". They have been theoretically proposed to exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties because of their strong tolerance to defects. However, no anti-gap semiconductors have been identified so far, despite a known list of semiconductors with an antibonding VBM. Here, we use high-throughput computation to identify over 100 anti-gap semiconductors. From this group, we analyze the transition metal dichalcogenide MX$_2$ (M=Hf, Zr; X=S, Se) family in detail. In addition to verifying their defect tolerance for both electrons and holes using first-principles simulations, we also discovered that photoexcitation of charge carriers can lead to significant lattice stiffening and increased thermal conductivity in anti-gap semiconductors, which can be potentially used as photo-driven thermal switches. Our work analyzes the formation of the anti-gap electronic structure and showcases their unusual photoinduced lattice dynamics that can have a potential impact on their photophysical applications.

Title: Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Methanation by High-Entropy Oxides: Significance of Work Function
Authors: Jacqueline Hidalgo-Jiménez, Taner Akbay, Xavier Sauvage, Tatsumi Ishihara, Kaveh Edalati
Abstract: Methane (CH4) formation from photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion in water is currently of interest because methane is a fuel, and it can also be transformed into other useful hydrocarbons. However, achieving high selectivity to produce methane remains a challenge because of the large number of contributing electrons (eight) in methanation. High-entropy oxides present a new pathway to tune the catalyst selectivity by arranging various cations in the lattice. This study aims to clarify the selectivity for methane formation in high-entropy photocatalysts containing hybrid d0 + d10 orbital configuration. Several oxides are designed and synthesized which have a base of 3-4 cations with d0 orbital configuration (titanium and zirconium with a valence of 4, and niobium and tantalum with a valence of 5) and incorporate 1-2 elements with d10 orbital configuration (zinc, gallium, indium, bismuth and copper). Results demonstrate that adding elements with a d10 electronic configuration is effective for methane formation, while the selectivity toward methanation is enhanced by increasing the work function of the d10 cations. Selectivity levels over 50% are achieved using these oxides, suggesting a potential strategy for designing new catalysts for methanation.

Title: Reduced density matrix approach to one-dimensional ultracold bosonic systems
Authors: Mitchell J. Knight, Harry M. Quiney, Andy M. Martin
Abstract: The variational determination of the two-boson reduced density matrix is described for a one-dimensional system of $N$ (where $N$ ranges from $2$ to $10^4$) harmonically trapped bosons interacting via contact interaction. The ground-state energies are calculated, and compared to existing methods in the field, including the analytic case (for $N=2)$ and mean-field approaches such as the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation and its variations. Structural properties including the density and correlation functions are also derived, including the behaviour of the correlation function when boson coordinates coincide, collectively demonstrating the capacity of the reduced density matrix method to accurately calculate ground-state properties of bosonic systems comprising few to many bosons, including the cross-over region between these extremes, across a large range of interaction strengths.

Title: From Paramagnet to Dipolar Topological Order via Duality and Dipolar SPT
Authors: Jintae Kim, Jong Yeon Lee, Jung Hoon Han
Abstract: A scheme for the adaptive preparation of a topological state with dipole symmetry, dubbed the dipolar topological state (dTS), which serves as an example of translation symmetry-enriched topological phase, is proposed. The midcircuit state emerging during the preparation process is identified as a two-dimensional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state protected by dipole bundle symmetry alongside charge and 1-form symmetries. The non-trivial boundary modes of the dipolar SPT state exhibiting the spontaneous breaking of charge and dipole bundle symmetries are analyzed. The duality map between the paramagnetic state and the dipolar topological state is established in the framework of the {\it simultaneous gauging} of two charge symmetries and one dipole symmetry that cannot be reduced as sequential gauging of the individual symmetry. Leveraging this duality, we work out the phase diagram of the dipolar topological state under perturbations by various transverse fields.

Title: Impact of tiny Fermi pockets with extremely high mobility on the Hall anomaly in the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: S. Liu, M. Roppongi, M. Kimata, K. Ishihara, R. Grasset, M. Konczykowski, B. R. Ortiz, S. D. Wilson, K. Yoshimi, T. Shibauchi, K. Hashimoto
Abstract: The kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits an unusual charge-density-wave (CDW) order, where the emergence of loop current order that breaks time-reversal symmetry (TRS) has been proposed. A key feature of this CDW phase is a non-monotonic Hall effect at low fields, often attributed to TRS breaking. However, its origin remains unclear. Here, we conduct comprehensive magnetotransport measurements on CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and, through mobility spectrum analysis, identify the formation of tiny Fermi pockets with extremely high mobility below the CDW transition. Furthermore, electron irradiation experiments reveal that the non-monotonic Hall effect is significantly suppressed in samples with reduced mobility, despite no substantial change in the electronic structure. These results indicate that the non-monotonic Hall effect originates from these tiny Fermi pockets with high mobility carriers rather than anomalous Hall mechanisms, providing new insights into understanding the Hall anomaly in this kagome system.

Title: Theory of Two-level Tunneling Systems in Superconductors
Authors: Junguang He, Wei-Ting Lin, J. A. Sauls
Abstract: We develop a field theory formulation for the interaction of an ensemble of two-level tunneling systems (TLS) with the electronic states of a superconductor. Predictions for the impact of two-level tunneling systems on superconductivity are presented, including $T_c$ and spectrum of quasiparticle states for conventional BCS superconductors. We show that non-magnetic TLS impurities in conventional s-wave superconductors can act as pair-breaking or pair-enhancing defects depending on the level population of the distribution of TLS impurities. We present calculations of the enhancement of superconductivity, both $T_c$ and the order parameter, for TLS defects in thermal equilibrium with the electrons and lattice. The scattering of quasiparticles by TLS impurities leads to sub-gap states below the bulk excitation gap, $\Delta$, as well as resonances in the continuum above $\Delta$. The energies and spectral weights of these states depend on the distribution of tunnel splittings, while the spectral weights are particularly sensitive to the level occupation of the TLS impurities. Under microwave excitation, or decoupling from the thermal bath, a nonequilibrium level population of the TLS distribution generates subgap quasiparticle states near the Fermi level which contribute to dissipation and thus degrade the performance of superconducting devices at low temperatures.

Title: Method for bioinspired electron bifurcation by semiconductor electrochemistry

Abstract: Electron bifurcating enzymes oxidize a two-electron donor, pushing one electron thermodynamically uphill to reduce a low-potential acceptor by leveraging the downhill flow of the other electron to a high-potential acceptor. Electron bifurcation can achieve near 100\% energy conversion efficiency if operating in a near-reversible regime. Theories of charge transport and heterogeneous electron transfer reveal that bioinspired electron bifurcation is possible in tailored semiconductor electrochemical junctions: three-way n-p-electrolyte junctions. A two-electron species is oxidized at the semiconducting surface, injecting the resulting charges into the semiconductor. If the junction is properly configured, the electrons will spontaneously bifurcate into the n- and p-doped regions. If a bias is applied across these regions, the semiconductor-electrolyte junction will transduce energy by pushing half of the current to higher potential and half to lower potential. Energy wasting short circuit processes are be defeated using the carrier distributions and dynamics that occur naturally in these junctions. Furthermore, bifurcating junctions seem to require only fundamental electrochemical processes that have been observed in other contexts, and does not require fine-tuning of kinetic rate constants (although tuning may improve performance). Theory and simulation of bifurcating junctions reveals critical design principles and suggests that $\sim 100 \mu\text{A}/\text{cm}^2 - 1 \hspace{2 pt} m\text{A/cm}^2$ of bifurcated current is a reasonable goal for bifurcating junctions, but further enhancement seems possible.

Title: Diode and selective routing functionalities controlled by geometry in current-induced spin-orbit torque driven magnetic domain wall devices
Authors: Elena M. Stetco, Traian Petrisor, Ovidiu A. Pop, Mohamed Belmeguenai, Ioan M. Miron, Mihai S. Gabor
Abstract: Research on current-induced domain wall (DW) motion in heavy metal/ferromagnet structures is crucial for advancing memory, logic, and computing devices. Here, we demonstrate that adjusting the angle between the DW conduit and the current direction provides an additional degree of control over the current-induced DW motion. A DW conduit with a 45° section relative to the current direction enables asymmetrical DW behaviour: for one DW polarity, motion proceeds freely, while for the opposite polarity, motion is impeded or even blocked in the 45° zone, depending on the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction strength. This enables the device to function as a DW diode. Leveraging this velocity asymmetry, we designed a Y-shaped DW conduit with one input and two output branches at +45° and -45°, functioning as a DW selector. A DW injected into the junction exits through one branch, while a reverse polarity DW exits through the other, demonstrating selective DW routing.

Title: Optical control of the moiré twist angle
Authors: Zhiren He, Prathap Kumar Jharapla, Nicolas Leconte, Jeil Jung, Guru Khalsa
Abstract: Moiré multilayers offer a promising platform for engineering diverse functionalities in a single material via twist angle control. However, achieving reliable, high-precision control of the twist angle remains challenging. In this theoretical work, we propose an all-optical method for fast, precise manipulation of two-dimensional multilayers by transferring orbital angular momentum from phase-structured light (e.g. vortex beams) to a 2D material flake. We model the light-matter interaction, analyze the twist dynamics, and develop a phase diagram for optical twist angle switching -- transition to a neighboring metastable twist angle -- by mapping the system onto an impulsively forced nonlinear pendulum. Aided by pairwise classical potential estimates for the interlayer energy and numerical simulation, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with hexagonal boron nitride bilayers and extend the results to dichalcogenides with first-principles calculations. Our findings reveal a rich dynamical response -- from single-pulse twist angle control to high-order quasistable orbits pointing toward periodically driven chaotic dynamics -- and suggest a pathway for all-optical measurement of the twist potential energy. These results can be generalized to other 2D multilayers, paving the way for scalable and customizable moiré electronics and photonics.

Title: Effects of Berry curvature on ideal band magnetorotons
Authors: Jingtian Shi, Jennifer Cano, Nicolás Morales-Durán
Abstract: We investigate the many-body ground states in a family of fractionally-filled bands where the Berry curvature fluctuations can be tuned while maintaining ideal quantum geometry. We numerically find that the neutral gap of the fractional Chern insulator (FCI) ground state decreases as the Berry curvature becomes less homogeneous, ultimately driving an instability to a charge density wave. We derive an analytical model to explain this behavior by applying the single mode approximation to the ground state wave functions of the ideal band, from which we obtain a perturbative expression for the magnetoroton minimum. We extend our analysis to bands where the quantum geometry is weakly perturbed away from ideal and give examples where a less ideal band geometry results in a more stable FCI phase.

Title: Influence of structural disorder on magnetic properties and electronic structure of YCo$_2$
Authors: Z. Śniadecki (1), N. Pierunek (1), B. Idzikowski (1), B. Wasilewski (1), M. Werwiński (1), U.K. Rößler (2), Yu. Ivanisenko (3) ((1) Institute of Molecular Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznań, Poland, (2) Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research Dresden, Dresden, Germany, (3) Institute of Nanotechnology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany)
Abstract: In this paper, the changes of magnetic properties with increasing disorder in the exchange enhanced Pauli paramagnet YCo$_2$ are discussed. The structural disorder is initially introduced by rapid quenching, while further changes on micro-/nanoscale are caused by a high pressure torsion (HPT). Values of the magnetic moment determined for the plastically deformed ribbons reach 0.10 $\mu_B$/Co atom (for a sample subjected to the deformation at a pressure of 4 GPa) and 0.25 $\mu_B$/Co (6 GPa) at 2 K. Magnetic moment arise not only from the surface of nanocrystals but also from volume. Ab initio calculations explained the influence of chemical disorder and different types of structural defects on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of YCo2-based Laves phases. The calculated magnetic ground states are in qualitative agreement with experimental results for all considered structures with point defects.

Title: Normal and inverse magnetocaloric effects in structurally disordered Laves phase Y$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$Co$_{2}$ (0 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 1) compounds
Authors: Natalia Pierunek (1), Zbigniew Śniadecki (1), Mirosław Werwiński (1), Bartosz Wasilewski (1), Victorino Franco (2), Bogdan Idzikowski (1) ((1) Institute of Molecular Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznań, Poland, (2) Condensed Matter Physics Department, Seville University, Seville, Spain)
Abstract: Magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of Y$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$Co$_{2}$ compounds, where x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0, were investigated experimentally and theoretically. Crystal structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (Rietveld analysis) and investigated samples possess the MgCu$_{2}$-type single phase with Fd-3m space group. Melt-spinning process introduced a chemical and topological disorder, which directly affected the magnetic properties. Refrigerant capacity (RC), strictly connected to the full width at half maximum $\delta$TFWHM of the $\Delta$S$_M$(T) curve and the maximum of magnetic entropy changes $\Delta$S$_{Mpk}$(T)(T,$\Delta$H), increases from 29 to 148 J/kg with replacement of Y by Gd atoms from x = 0.2 to x = 0.8. RC and $\delta$TFWHM indicate the presence of disorder. Temperature dependences of magnetic entropy change $\Delta$S$_M$(T,$\Delta$H) and RC were measured in as-quenched and annealed state for Y$_{0.4}$Gd$_{0.6}$Co$_{2}$. This particular composition was chosen for detailed investigation mainly due to its Curie point (T$_C$ = 282 K), which is close to the room temperature. After isothermal annealing ($\tau_a$ = 60 min, Ta = 700$^o$C) RC decreased from 122 to 104 J/kg, which clearly indicates the homogenization of the heat treated sample. Furthermore, observed inverse magnetocaloric effect is associated with the presence of antiferromagnetically coupled Gd and Co magnetic moments. The phase transition temperature increases with increasing Gd content from 74 to 407 K for Y$_{0.8}$Gd$_{0.2}$Co$_{2}$ and GdCo2, respectively. Within the FPLO-LDA DFT method, the non-magnetic ground state for YCo$_{2}$ and the magnetic ground state for GdCo$_{2}$ are predicted in agreement with experiment. The dependence of calculated total and species-resolved magnetic moments on Gd concentration reasonably agrees with available experimental data.

Title: Induced magnetic ordering in alloyed compounds based on Pauli paramagnet YCo$_2$
Authors: Z. Śniadecki (1), M. Werwiński (1), A. Szajek (1), U.K. Rößler (2), B. Idzikowski (1) ((1) Institute of Molecular Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznań, Poland, (2) Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research Dresden, Dresden, Germany)
Abstract: Intermetallic YCo$_2$ compound is a Pauli exchange-enhanced paramagnet. Structural and magnetic properties of rapidly quenched YCo$_2$ and YCo$_2$ alloyed with Nb or Ti are presented. Samples produced by melt spinning have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). The samples crystallize in MgCu$_2$-type phase with lattice constant a changing from 7.223 A for YCo$_2$, through 7.213 A for Y$_{0.9}$Nb$_{0.1}$Co$_2$ to 7.192 A for Y$_{0.9}$Ti$_{0.1}$Co$_2$, where Y atoms are replaced by Nb or Ti atoms. Nanocrystalline phases can be produced by appropriate cooling rates for the solidification process. By the synthesis process free volumes, vacancies, and alloyed atoms are introduced into the YCo$_2$ intermetallic. Ab-initio calculations have been performed to investigate the effects of substitution on the spin-split electronic band structure in the ordered YCo$_2$. A ferrimagnetic ground state is found in the alloyed systems with substitution on the Y-site which is energetically favorable compared to point defects on Co-sites. However, the experimentally found increased magnetic ordering in alloyed YCo$_2$ appears to be based on microstructure effects.

Title: 1-Adamantanamine implementation in surface engineering of biomimetic PVDF-based membranes for enhanced membrane distillation

Abstract: Membrane distillation (MD) stands at the forefront of desalination technology, harnessing the power of phase change to separate water vapor from saline using minimal energy resources efficiently. In response to this challenge, membranes with tuned pores morphology and surface chemistry with biomimetic 3D pine-like structures with improved affinity to water (desalination) and/or hazardous VOC (VOC removal) were developed and studied systematically. By implementing VIPS-PVDF membranes and a green modifier of 1-adamantanamine for the first time, membranes with a revolutionary network architecture were generated. The modifier was introduced either physically to the polymeric matrix or chemically through covalent attachment onto the surface and inside the porous structure. As a result, membranes that defy wetting under extreme hydrostatic pressures (>11.5 bar) were produced while preserving unparalleled vapor transport efficiency. The 1-adamantanamine promotes transport and enhances the affinity to the VOC, ensuring excellent membrane performance at different applications of the MD process. Transport was enhanced more than 3.6 times and separation factor beta changed from 3.48 to 15.22 for MTBE removal and from 2.0 to 3.46 for EtOH removal when comparing pristine PVDF with membrane chemically modified with 1-adamantanamine (PVDF_Ch02). The process separation index during the MTBE removal changed from 20 kg m-2 h-1 (PVDF) to 297 kg m-2 h-1 (PVDF_Ch02). All materials were highly stable and durable during the MD applications. This innovative approach not only revolutionizes desalination but also holds immense promise for diverse applications beyond, particularly in the realm of wastewater treatment. A study of the icing process on a cold plate with new membranes provided deeper insight into the icing mechanism and the role of membrane LEP in it.

Title: Solutions of first passage times problems: a biscaling approach
Authors: Talia Baravi, David A. Kessler, Eli Barkai
Abstract: We study the first-passage time (FPT) problem for widespread recurrent processes in confined though large systems and present a comprehensive framework for characterizing the FPT distribution over many time scales. We find that the FPT statistics can be described by two scaling functions: one corresponds to the solution for an infinite system, and the other describes a scaling that depends on system size. We find a universal scaling relationship for the FPT moments $\langle t^q \rangle$ with respect to the domain size and the source-target distance. This scaling exhibits a transition at $q_c=\theta$, where $\theta$ is the persistence exponent. For low-order moments with $q<q_c$, convergence occurs towards the moments of an infinite system. In contrast, the high-order moments, $q>q_c$, can be derived from an infinite density function. The presented uniform approximation, connecting the two scaling functions, provides a description of the first-passage time statistics across all time scales. We extend the results to include diffusion in a confining potential in the high-temperature limit, where the potential strength takes the place of the system's size as the relevant scale. This study has been applied to various mediums, including a particle in a box, two-dimensional wedge, fractal geometries, non-Markovian processes and the non-equilibrium process of resetting.

Title: Valley Emission and Upconversion in Isotopically Engineered Monolayer WS$_2$ under Resonant Excitation
Authors: Rahul Kesarwani, Vaibhav Varade, Artur Slobodeniuk, Martin Kalbac, Jana Vejpravova
Abstract: In the quest to optimize the optoelectronic and valleytronic properties of 2D materials, various strategies such as strain engineering, doping, and heterostructuring have been explored. In this direction, isotope engineering also offers a potential avenue to alter electron-phonon interaction and impact quasiparticle scattering processes. In this study, we investigate the dependence of sulfur isotopes on upconversion and valley scattering phenomena by collecting the resonance photoluminescence (PL) under an applied magnetic field from 0 to 14 T at 4 K for the chemical vapor deposition-grown monolayer (1L) of W$^{N}$S$_2$, W$^{32}$S$_2$, and W$^{34}$S$_2$. The upconversion of the mixed-state sulfur 1L (W$^{N}$S$_2$) exhibits one M-phonon absorption, with an obtained optical gain of nearly 30 meV, while the pure sulfur isotope labelled 1Ls (W$^{32}$S$_2$ and W$^{34}$S$_2$) require two phonons (M and $\Gamma$), yielding a gain of around 80 meV. It is also found that the exciton degree of polarization (DOP) of W$^{N}$S$_2$ changes significantly by $\sim$ -30$\%$ as the field increases from 0 to 14 T, while for W$^{32}$S$_2$ and W$^{34}$S$_2$, the exciton DOP increases by up to $\sim$ 8$\%$. Similarly, distinct changes in the DOP are observed for trions and localized excitons among all the samples, attributed to the different valley scattering phenomena. The 1L W$^{N}$S$_2$ demonstrates a combination of intraband and interband scattering, whereas in the case of W$^{32}$S$_2$ intraband scattering is preferred; W$^{34}$S$_2$ predominantly exhibits interband scattering. Finally, a phenomenological model is proposed to describe the upconversion and valley scattering processes.

Title: Negative specific heats: where Clausius and Boltzmann entropies separate
Authors: Lander Bogers, Faezeh Khodabandehlou, Christian Maes
Abstract: Steady nonequilibria dissipate energy and, when changing external parameters, an extra or excess heat accompanies the relaxation to the new nonequilibrium condition. For nonequilibrium systems in contact with a thermal bath, the heat capacity is defined as that excess heat per degree temperature for a quasistatic change of the bath temperature. It is fairly common to find negative heat capacities for steady nonequilibrium systems, in contrast with the situation for systems in thermal equilibrium. We discuss and illustrate the origin of that negative thermal response using Markov models. We find that the negativity results from an anticorrelation between quasipotential and (a change in) pseudopotential, the first measuring (excess) heat (and Clausius entropy), and the latter being related to the Boltzmann entropy. It can be quantified via an appropriate choice of effective temperatures.

Title: Lithium doping's effects on the microstructural,dielectric,energy storage,optical and electrical properties of BaTi0.89Sn0.11O3 ceramics

Abstract: This research study the sol/gel synthesis of lithium-doped barium stannate titanate BaTi0.89Sn0.11O3 (BTS11) and investigates how varying composition with lithium affect its structural, morphological, ferroelectric, optical, and electrical properties. The phase of the sol/gel prepared samples with different compositions BaLixTi0.89Sn0.11O3 (BLxTS11), where x = 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8, and 10%, was examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), which showed the development of a pure perovskite structure. Furthermore, structural characterization was performed with Raman spectroscopy to identify changes in structure and chemical environment resulting from Li incorporation. The doping caused changes in the morphology and grain size of BLxTS11 pellets, as examined through SEM micrographs. These micrographs showed clear alterations in grain size that were inversely related to the lattice strain of BLxTS11. The samples were subsequently examined for their ferroelectric properties. All samples exhibited their maximum dielectric constant at approximately 45-50 °C. Furthermore, relationships between the chemical, structural, and morphological characteristics of the BLxTS11 ceramics and their energy storage capabilities were identified. Based on the P-E hysteresis behavior, the BL6TS11 ceramic (x=6%) ferroelectric exhibited superior energy-storage capabilities, featuring a recoverable energy-storage density of 225 mJ/cm3 and an energy-storage efficiency of 60%. An examination of the material's optical and electrical properties revealed that Li doping led to a reduction in the band gap values and a considerable increase in resistivity.

Abstract: These notes are based on the lectures that one of us (HT) gave at the Summer School on the "Theory of Large Deviations and Applications", held in July 2024 at Les Houches in France. They present the basic definitions and mathematical results that form the theory of large deviations, as well as many simple motivating examples of applications in statistical physics, which serve as a basis for the many other lectures given at the school that covered more specific applications in biophysics, random matrix theory, nonequilibrium systems, geophysics, and the simulation of rare events, among other topics. These notes extend the lectures, which can be accessed online, by presenting exercises and pointer references for further reading.

Title: Generalized incommensurability: the role of anomalously strong spin-orbit coupling for the spin ordering in a quasi-2D system, FeSe
Authors: Piotr Chudzinski, Abyay Ghosh, Myrta Gruening
Abstract: We study 2D spin and orbital systems, in a classical limit, in a regime where their coupling is so strong that orbital fluctuations are able to change sign of spin-exchange. Our aim is to understand how different phases in the orbital sector determine the ordering in the spin sector. The existence of intermediate vortex crystal (VC) phases, beside the canonical Kosterlitz and Thouless (KT) phases is now a well-established fact. Recently, we found [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 043154] that such a phase can explain phase diagram of FeSe. Motivated by this, here we develop a Renormalization Group (RG) method which can capture the formation of the VC phase. We achieve it by incorporating orbital vortex-vortex interactions through space-dependent incommensurability. Simultaneously, we incorporate the coupling with the spin sector for both short- and long-range interactions. We then derive a phase diagram including the effects of long-range interactions and spin-orbit coupling. The presence of the intermediate VC phase in the orbital sector changes the scaling of long-range spin-spin interactions, making them relevant under specific conditions. We thus find that the regular arrangement of orbital vortices can induce a long-range order in the 2D spin system.

Title: Machine-learning potentials for structurally and chemically complex MAB phases: strain hardening and ripplocation-mediated plasticity
Authors: Nikola Koutná, Shuyao Lin, Lars Hultman, Davide G. Sangiovanni, Paul H. Mayrhofer
Abstract: Though offering unprecedented pathways to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of technologically-relevant materials and conditions, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are typically trained for ``simple'' materials and properties with minor size effects. Our study of MAB phases (MABs) - alternating transition metal boride (MB) and group A element layers - exemplifies that MLIPs for complex materials can be fitted and used in a high-throughput fashion: for predicting structural and mechanical properties across a large chemical/phase/temperature space. Considering group 4-6 transition metal based MABs, with A=Al and the 222, 212, and 314 type phases, three MLIPs are trained and tested, including lattice and elastic constants calculations at temperatures $T\in\{0,300,1200\}$ K, extrapolation grade and energy (force, stress) error analysis for $\approx{3\cdot10^6}$ ab initio MD snapshots. Subsequently, nanoscale tensile tests serve to quantify upper limits of strength and toughness attainable in single-crystal MABs at 300~K as well as their temperature evolution. In-plane tensile deformation is characterised by relatively high strength, {110}$\langle001\rangle$ type slipping, and failure by shear banding. The response to [001] loading is softer, triggers work hardening, and failure by kinking and layer delamination. Furthermore, W$_2$AlB$_2$ able to retard fracture via ripplocations and twinning from 300 up to 1200~K.

Title: Quantum skyrmions and antiskyrmions in monoaxial chiral magnets
Authors: Stefan Liscak, Andreas Haller, Andreas Michels, Thomas L. Schmidt, Vladyslav M. Kuchkin
Abstract: Classical monoaxial chiral magnets represent a unique magnetic system that allows for the stabilization of both skyrmions and antiskyrmions of equal energy. Unlike a similar situation in frustrated magnets, the energy landscape here is much simpler, consisting of four states: the saturated ferromagnetic state, spin-spiral, skyrmion, and antiskyrmion. This simplicity makes such systems interesting for potential applications that rely on manipulating these states. We study the quantum analog of the already established classical theory by investigating the low-energy excitation spectra of a spin-1/2 quantum Heisenberg model with monoaxial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we establish that such a model supports the existence of skyrmion and antiskyrmion states of equal energy. This degeneracy allows for the existence of a mesoscopic Schrödinger cat state exhibiting properties of both skyrmion and antiskyrmion. To characterize this superposition, we calculate two-point correlation functions that can be measured in neutron scattering experiments. Finally, we introduce a perturbation in the form of a magnetic field gradient to induce a non-trivial time evolution of the superposition state. We study this time evolution using both a numerical variational approach and the collective coordinates method.

Title: Dynamic Carrier Modulation via Nonlinear Acoustoelectric Transport in van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: Timothy J. McSorley, Kaustubh Simha, James E. Corcoran, Izzie J. Catanzaro, Haochong Zhang, Meitong Yin, Tzu-Ming Lu, Davis Thuillier, Marshall A. Campbell, Thomas Scaffidi, Luis A. Jauregui
Abstract: Dynamically manipulating carriers in van der Waals heterostructures could enable solid-state quantum simulators with tunable lattice parameters. A key requirement is forming deep potential wells to reliably trap excitations. Here, we report the observation of nonlinear acoustoelectric transport and dynamic carrier modulation in boron nitride-encapsulated graphene devices coupled to intense surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on LiNbO3 substrates. SAWs generate strong acoustoelectric current densities (JAE), transitioning from linear to nonlinear regimes with increasing SAW intensity. In the nonlinear regime, periodic carrier (electrons, holes, or their mixtures) stripes emerge. Using counter-propagating SAWs, we create standing SAWs (SSAWs) to dynamically manipulate charge distributions without static gates. The saturation of JAE, attenuation transitions, and tunable resistance peaks confirm strong carrier localization. These results establish SAWs as a powerful tool for controlling carrier dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) materials, paving the way for the development of time-dependent quantum systems and acoustic lattices for quantum simulation.

Abstract: We present a novel Python tool for the analysis of Geant4 simulations that enhances our understanding of coherent phenomena occurring during the interaction of charged particles with crystal planes. This tool compares the total energy of particles with the potential energy inside crystal channels, enabling a complete examination of coherent effects. By tracking the particle trajectory and classifying the dynamics at each simulation step, it provides deeper insights into how different phenomena contribute to both radiation and particle deflection. This tool can be used to improve crystal-based extraction methods and the development of gamma-ray sources using crystals.

Title: Universal class of exactly solvable diffusions from space-time transformations
Authors: Costantino Di Bello, Édgar Roldán, Ralf Metzler
Abstract: We consider a general one-dimensional overdamped diffusion model described by the Itô stochastic differential equation (SDE) ${dX_t=\mu(X_t,t)dt+\sigma (X_t,t)dW_t}$, where $W_t$ is the standard Wiener process. We obtain a specific condition that $\mu$ and $\sigma$ must fulfil in order to be able to solve the SDE via mapping the generic process, using a suitable space-time transformation, onto the simpler Wiener process. By taking advantage of this transformation, we obtain the propagator in the case of open, reflecting, and absorbing \emph{ time-dependent\/} boundary conditions for a large class of diffusion processes. In particular, this allows us to derive the first-passage time statistics of such a large class of models, some of which were so far unknown. While our results are valid for a wide range of non-autonomous, non-linear and non-homogeneous processes, we illustrate applications in stochastic thermodynamics by focusing on fixed-time and first-passage-time statistics of isoentropic processes.

Title: Exact Fluctuating Hydrodynamics of the Scaled Light-Heavy Model
Authors: Shilpa Prakash, Mustansir Barma, Kabir Ramola
Abstract: We study the exact fluctuating hydrodynamics of the scaled Light-Heavy model (sLH), in which two species of particles (light and heavy) interact with a fluctuating surface. This model is similar in definition to the unscaled Light-Heavy model (uLH), except it uses rates scaled with the system size. The consequence, it turns out, is a phase diagram that differs from that of the unscaled model. We derive the fluctuating hydrodynamics for this model using an action formalism involving the construction of path integrals for the probability of different states that give the complete macroscopic picture starting from the microscopic one. This is then used to obtain the two-point steady-state (static) correlation functions between fluctuations in the two density fields in the homogeneous phase. We show that these theoretical results match well with microscopic simulations away from the critical line. We derive an exponentially decaying form for the two-point steady-state correlation function with a correlation length that diverges as the critical line is approached. Finally, we also compute the dynamic correlations in the homogeneous phase and use them to determine the relaxation dynamics as well as the dynamic exponents of the system.

Title: Elastic displacements and viscous hydrodynamic flows in wedge-shaped geometries featuring a straight edge: Green's functions for forces oriented parallel to the edge
Authors: Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Lukas Fischer, Marc Pradas, Andreas M. Menzel
Abstract: For homogeneous and isotropic linearly elastic solids and for incompressible fluids under low-Reynolds-number conditions the fundamental solutions of the associated continuum equations were derived a long time ago for bulk systems. That is, the corresponding Green's functions are available in infinitely extended systems, where boundaries do not play any role. However, introducing boundaries renders the situation significantly more complex. Here, we derive the corresponding Green's functions for a linearly elastic homogeneous and isotropic material in a wedge-shaped geometry. Two flat boundaries confine the material and meet at a straight edge. No-slip and free-slip conditions are considered. The force is oriented in a direction parallel to the straight edge of the wedge. Assuming incompressibility, our expressions also apply to the situation of low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamic viscous fluid flows. Thus, they may be used, for instance, to describe the motion of self-propelled objects guided by an edge or the distortion of soft elastic actuators in wedge-shaped environments of operation.

Title: Effect of Accelerated Thermal Degradation of Poly(Vinyl Chloride): The Case of Unplasticized PVC
Authors: Marwa Saad, Marek Bucki, Sonia Bujok, Dominika Pawcenis, Tjaša Rijavec, Karol Górecki, Łukasz Bratasz, Irena Kralj Cigić, Matija Strlič, Krzysztof Kruczała
Abstract: The thermal degradation of unplasticized poly(vinyl chloride), PVC, was comprehensively investigated through the application of spectroscopic techniques, as well as contact angle measurements (CA), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). To study the effect of relative humidity (RH) on the deterioration of unplasticized PVC, two regimes of accelerated degradation experiments were selected: low RH (max. 30% RH) and high RH = 60% levels, which corresponds to usually the highest RH in heritage institutions equipped with an HVAC system. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) did not reveal any significant changes in the material during its degradation up to 20 weeks at temperatures ranging from 60°C to 80°C. Notable changes were observed in the Raman and UV-Vis spectra, indicative of the formation of conjugated carbon-carbon double bonds. The formation of polyenes was responsible for the yellowing of samples. Notwithstanding, the aforementioned changes did not lead to a notable decline in the mechanical properties, as evidenced by DMA and SEC measurements. EPR measurements demonstrated the formation of 2 radicals at 60°C, and in the sample degraded at 80°C the presence of radicals was evident. This indicates that a radical degradation mechanism cannot be excluded even at such low temperatures.

Title: Exploring nonlinear ion dynamics in polymer electrolytes from the perspective of hopping models
Authors: Alina Wettstein, Diddo Diddens, Andreas Heuer
Abstract: Relevant information about the nature of the dynamics of ions in electrolytes can be obtained by studying the nonlinear dependence on an applied electric field. Here we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the field effects for a polymer electrolyte, i.e. a mixture of PEO with Li-TFSI salt, for a range of different temperatures and salt contents. Specifically, the effects of the electric field on the current and the diffusivities parallel and orthogonal to the electric fields are analyzed. It is argued that the nonlinear effects in the weak-field regime provide information about the nature of the disorder. In contrast, the nonlinear effects in the high-field regime allow one to extract effective hopping distances. They are in close agreement with typical nearest-neighbor length scales obtained from detailed structural analysis and are hardly dependent on the salt content. Furthermore, from the study of the temperature dependence in the high-field regime, effective barrier heights can be determined, which in this regime decrease linearly with increasing field. The disappearance of the effective barriers, estimated by linear extrapolation, occurs close to the fields where the MD simulations start to be numerically unstable. Finally, the interpretation is supported by a comparison with analytically known solutions of disordered hopping models.

Abstract: CsSnI3 perovskite is a promising thin-film semiconductor with high intrinsic conductivity for various device applications (thermoelectric, photovoltaics, etc.). Stoichiometric CsSnI3 owns high-density of defects and structural imperfections affecting device performance. In this work, we made an investigation on A-site cation engineering to evaluate the correlation between structural and transport parameters for effective operation in rectifying devices. Here, we analyzed CsSnI3 thin films modified with methylamine (MA), formamidine(FA), guanidine(GuA) and 5-ammonium valeric acid (AVA) cations, correlating structural parameters obtained by Rietveld refinement with their optoelectronic and diode characteristics. MA-, FA-, and GuA-substituted films exhibited low sheet resistance (450-2200 Ohm per sq). However, strain-induced lattice distortions and accumulated defects in GuA-substituted films significantly hindered effective charge collection and increased recombination losses. AVA substitution formed low-conductivity 2D interlayers, dramatically increasing resistance (105 Ohm per sq) and altering transient response characteristics, yet provided minimal reverse-switching losses (100 uW per cm2), beneficial for high-frequency applications. FA substitution emerged as optimal, balancing structural stability, conductivity, minimal defects, and superior diode properties. The obtained results highlight that targeted lattice modifications strongly influence the practical performance of rectifying p-i-n diodes based on CsSnI3.

Title: Tunneling density of states in exotic superconductors and spatial patterns of particle-hole interference
Authors: Archisman Panigrahi, Vladislav Poliakov, Leonid Levitov
Abstract: Tunneling spectroscopy of superconductors provides valuable insights into gap symmetry, quasiparticle dynamics, and pairing mechanisms. This paper explores spatial patterns of quasiparticle interference in the tunneling density of states (TDOS) near localized impurities. These patterns emerge because Bogoliubov quasiparticles, as coherent superpositions of electrons and holes, drive reversible particle-to-hole conversion within the superconductor. Impurities act as beam splitters, generating interference between particle and hole states, forming spatial fringes reminiscent of Young's double-slit experiment. In topological superconductors, these interference patterns are further modulated by nodal lines that encode the nodal structure and phase of the gap function, $\Delta(\vec p)$. Notably, the patterns directly reveal the winding number of $\Delta(\vec p)$ phase, offering a unique probe of exotic, non-BCS pairing and a powerful tool for detecting topological superconductivity.

Title: Exciton Binding Energies in 2D Materials: Insights from Braneworld Physics
Authors: Antoine Honet, Michaël Sarrazin
Abstract: In the present work, we introduce a new interpretation of exciton binding energies in two-dimensional (2D) materials using concepts from brane physics. We adapt the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati-Shifman mechanism to a (2+1)-dimensional brane in a (3+1)-D spacetime, deriving an effective electromagnetic potential on the brane. Using this potential, we develop a hydrogenic model for exciton binding energies in 2D materials, applying it to s-type excitons and comparing theoretical predictions with experimental results on WS$_{2}$ monolayers. This interdisciplinary approach bridges high-energy and condensed matter physics, offering a new didactic representation of excitons in low-dimensional systems.

Title: BaZrS$_\text{3}$ Lights Up: The Interplay of Electrons, Photons, and Phonons in Strongly Luminescent Single Crystals
Authors: Rasmus Svejstrup Nielsen, Ángel Labordet Álvarez, Yvonne Tomm, Galina Gurieva, Andres Ortega-Guerrero, Joachim Breternitz, Lorenzo Bastonero, Nicola Marzari, Carlo Pignedoli, Susan Schorr, Mirjana Dimitrievska
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials for the next generation of optoelectronic applications, with BaZrS$_\text{3}$ attracting significant attention due to its wide bandgap, earth-abundant composition, and thermal and chemical stability. However, previous studies have consistently reported weak and ambiguous photoluminescence (PL), regardless of synthesis method, raising questions about the intrinsic optoelectronic quality of this compound. In this work, we demonstrate strong, band-to-band-dominated PL at room temperature in high-quality BaZrS$_\text{3}$ single crystals. Using multiwavelength excitation and polarization-dependent Raman spectroscopy, along with first-principles lattice dynamics calculations, we identify all 23 theoretically predicted Raman-active modes and their symmetries, providing a comprehensive reference for future studies. Despite the narrow, single-component PL emission band, time-resolved PL measurements reveal a carrier lifetime of $1.0\pm0.2$ ns. We correlate the short carrier lifetimes with the presence of phonon-assisted carrier decay and strong electron-phonon coupling as evidenced from our DFT and Raman results. Whether compositional variations or partial cation/anion substitutions could mitigate electron-phonon coupling and enhance carrier lifetimes remains an open question. By providing a detailed reference for the intrinsic vibrational and optoelectronic properties of BaZrS$_\text{3}$, this work paves the way for further advancements in chalcogenide perovskites for energy and optoelectronic technologies.

Title: Dynamics of the vortex line density in superfluids under thermal activation
Authors: Sergey Nemirovskii
Abstract: The study explores the development of the vortex line density in superfluids under thermal activation. This problem is of interest to both applied and fundamental research, and has been investigated by many authors in various aspects. Despite the important and impressive results obtained, a significant part of the process, namely the kinetics of processes leading to equilibrium state, remained unexplored. In this article, we conduct a study of kinetic phenomena and focus our attention on the evolution of the vortex line density (VLD) L(t), the total length of the filament per unit volume. The initial development of VLD is due to random thermal fluctuations. The increase in the vortex line length L(t) can be obtained based on the famous Novikov-Furutsu theorem, which shows that the growth rate of L(t) is proportional to a random force correlator. As the length of the vortex filaments increases, the interaction between the vortices becomes significant and affects the dynamics process. At this point, we turn to the phenomenological Feynman-Vinen theory, which offers various models for the evolution of the quantity L(t). Next we examine the evolution of a vortex tangle as a combination of growth due to random thermal excitations and decay in the Feynman-Vinen theory. Several applications leading to significant and remarkable results are considered.

Title: Upper critical fields in high-$ T_{\rm{c}} $ superconductors
Authors: Wei Wei, Yuling Xiang, Qiang Hou, Yue Sun, Zhixiang Shi
Abstract: Since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates, understanding the unconventional pairing mechanism has remained one of the most significant challenges. The upper critical field ($H_{\rm{c2}}$) is an essential parameter for obtaining information on the pair-breaking mechanism, coherence length $\xi$, and pairing symmetry, all of which are crucial for understanding unconventional superconducting mechanisms. Here, we provide a brief review of studies on $ H_{\rm{c2}} $ in several representative series of cuprate, iron-based, and nickelate superconductors. By comparing the behavior of $ H_{\rm{c2}} $ as a function of temperature, doping concentration, and anisotropy across these three major classes of superconductors, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of the complex pairing interactions in high-temperature superconductors.

Title: Goldstone-mediated polar instability in hexagonal barium titanate
Authors: S. Simpson, U. Dey, R. J. Sjökvist, J. Wright, C. Ritter, R. Beanland, N. C. Bristowe, M. S. Senn
Abstract: We discover a rare structural manifestation of the Goldstone paradigm in a hexagonal polytype of the archetypal ferroelectric BaTiO3. First-principles calculations confirm the Goldstone character of the order parameter, and high-resolution diffraction measurements link this to a quasi-continuous domain texture in the vicinity of the low-temperature phase transitions. Our findings highlight how changes in structural topology may be exploited to realize rich polar topologies in bulk ferroelectric perovskites.

Title: Quasiparticle gap renormalization driven by internal and external screening in WS$_2$ device
Authors: Chakradhar Sahoo, Yann in 't Veld, Alfred J. H. Jones, Zhihao Jiang, Greta Lupi, Paulina E. Majchrzak, Kimberly Hsieh, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Philip Hofmann, Jill A. Miwa, Yong P. Chen, Malte Rösner, Søren Ulstrup
Abstract: The electronic band gap of a two-dimensional semiconductor within a device architecture is sensitive to variations in screening properties of adjacent materials in the device and to gate-controlled doping. Here, we employ micro-focused angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to separate band gap renormalization effects stemming from environmental screening and electron-doping during \textit{in situ} gating of a single-layer WS$_{2}$ device. The WS$_{2}$ is supported on hBN and contains a section that is exposed to vacuum and another section that is encapsulated by a graphene contact. We directly observe the doping-induced semiconductor-metal transition and band gap renormalization in the two sections of WS$_2$. Surprisingly, a larger band gap renormalization is observed in the vacuum-exposed section than in the graphene-encapsulated - and thus ostensibly better screened - section of the WS$_2$. Using $GW$ calculations, we determine that intrinsic screening due to stronger doping in vacuum exposed WS$_2$ exceeds the external environmental screening in graphene-encapsulated WS$_2$.

Title: Anomalous Chiral Anomaly in Spin-1 Fermionic Systems
Authors: Shantonu Mukherjee, Sayantan Sharma, Hridis K. Pal
Abstract: Chiral anomaly is a key feature of Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories: in presence of parallel external electric and magnetic fields, the number of massless Weyl fermions of a given chirality is not conserved. In condensed matter, emergent chiral fermions in Weyl semimetals exhibit the same anomaly, directly tied to the topological charge of the Weyl node, ensuring a quantized anomaly coefficient. However, many condensed matter systems break Lorentz symmetry while retaining topological nodes, raising the question of how chiral anomaly manifests in such settings. In this work, we investigate this question in spin-1 fermionic systems and show that the conventional anomaly equation is modified by an additional nontopological contribution, leading to a nonquantized anomaly coefficient. This surprising result arises because spin-1 fermions can be decomposed into 2-flavor Weyl fermions coupled to a Lorentz-breaking, momentum-dependent non-Abelian background potential. The interplay between this potential and external electromagnetic fields generates the extra term in the anomaly equation. Our framework naturally generalizes to other Lorentz-breaking systems beyond the spin-1 case.

Title: Thermodynamics-guided Numerical Modeling for Direct Reduction of Iron Ore Pellets
Authors: Ömer K. Büyükuslu, Fabrice Yang, Dierk Raabe, Moritz to Baben, Anna L. Ravensburg
Abstract: Direct reduction of iron using hydrogen-rich gas is rapidly emerging as a key strategy for green steel production. This process involves complex, multiscale phenomena, encompassing solid-state phase transformations and gas transport through pores, that must be accurately represented for predictive industrial implementation. Here, we present a thermodynamically sound pellet-scale model that describes these mechanisms and can serve as a foundation for improving the understanding of pellet reduction kinetics in H$_2$/CO-containing atmospheres. The model assumes that the gas phase remains in thermodynamic equilibrium, meaning that the composition of the gas instantaneously adjusts to any changes in the system. This reduces the number of fitting parameters drastically compared to other existing models, while maintaining a strict thermodynamic upper bound estimate. A driving force term is included in the reaction rate equation based on the partial pressure of O$_2$ in the equilibrated gas phase. This constrained equilibrium-based approach ensures that the three iron oxide reduction steps and the formation of graphite and cementite in carbon-containing gases occur only if they are thermodynamically possible. It is demonstrated that fitting kinetic parameters based on conversion degree data alone leads to overfitting. This is true both for existing models and the model introduced here, despite the fact that the latter contains fewer parameters. To overcome this overfitting problem, spatially resolved microstructural data at key reduction stages can be considered, as shown here for recently reported data for a pellet reduced in H$_2$ atmosphere.

Title: Machine Learning on Multiple Topological Materials Datasets
Authors: Yuqing He, Pierre-Paul De Breuck, Hongming Weng, Matteo Giantomassi, Gian-Marco Rignanese
Abstract: A dataset of 35,608 materials with their topological properties is constructed by combining the density functional theory (DFT) results of Materiae and the Topological Materials Database. Thanks to this, machine-learning approaches are developed to categorize materials into five distinct topological types, with the XGBoost model achieving an impressive 85.2% classification accuracy. By conducting generalization tests on different sub-datasets, differences are identified between the original datasets in terms of topological types, chemical elements, unknown magnetic compounds, and feature space coverage. Their impact on model performance is analyzed. Turning to the simpler binary classification between trivial insulators and nontrivial topological materials, three different approaches are also tested. Key characteristics influencing material topology are identified, with the maximum packing efficiency and the fraction of $\textit{p}$ valence electrons being highlighted as critical features.

Title: Kinetomagnetism and Altermagnetism
Authors: Sang-Wook Cheong, Fei-Ting Huang
Abstract: Kinetomagnetism refers to magnetization induced by (electric) current, encompassing longitudinal or transverse effects and even- or odd-order phenomena. The essential prerequisite for kinetomagnetism is the breaking of PT (=Parity times Time reversal) symmetry. Altermagnets, characterized by full spin compensation and broken PT symmetry, are associated with spin-split electronic bands. Altermagnets with non-zero net magnetizations (M-type) fall within the ferromagnetic point group and are classified as orbital ferrimagnets. In contrast, S- and A-type altermagnets only exhibit non-zero net magnetizations under external perturbations, such as (electric) current or mechanical stress, which preserve PT symmetry. This study delves into the intriguing interplay between altermagnetism and kinetomagnetism, emphasizing magnetic point group classifications, called as the SAM classification. Various orders of the anomalous Hall effect are analyzed alongside kinetomagnetism, extending the discussion to certain non-magnetic materials with low symmetry. The MPG analysis for kinetomagnetism and altermagnetism highlights significant scientific and technological opportunities, particularly in materials explorations.

Title: Photonic Negative Differential Thermal Conductance Enabled by NIS Junctions
Authors: M. Pioldi, G. De Simoni, A. Braggio, F. Giazotto
Abstract: Owing to their sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, normal metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junctions are leveraged in various thermal devices. This study illustrates that two NISIN reservoirs can achieve a measurable negative differential thermal conductance (NDTC). This phenomenon is enabled by photon-mediated heat exchange, which is profoundly affected by the temperature-dependent impedance matching between the reservoirs. Under appropriate configurations, the heat current is suppressed for increasingly large temperature gradients, leading to NDTC. We also propose experimental configurations where it is possible to discriminate this effect unambiguously. We employ superconducting aluminum in conjunction with either silver or epitaxial InAs to facilitate the experimental observation of NDTC at low temperatures over significant sub-Kelvin ranges. This advances the development of devices that exploit NDTC to enhance heat and temperature regulation in cryogenic environments, such as thermal switches, transistors, and amplifiers.

Title: Anatomy of torques from orbital Rashba textures: the case of Co/Al interfaces
Authors: A. Pezo, N. Sebe, A. Manchon, V. Cros, H. Jaffrès
Abstract: In the context of orbitronics, the rising of the orbital angular momentum generated at light metal interfaces from orbital textures via orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects nowadays represent extraordinary alternatives to the usual heavy-metal spin-based materials. In the light of very recent experimental results [\textcolor{blue}{S. Krishnia \textit{et al.}, Nanoletters 2023, 23, 6785}], starting from state-of-the-art density functional theory simulations, we provide theoretical insights into the emergence of very strong orbital torques at the Co/Al interface location a strong orbital Rashba texture. By using linear response theory, we calculate the exerted orbital torque amplitudes, mainly of field-like intraband character, acting onto the ultrathin Co. Moreover, we show that an insertion of a single atomic plane of Pt between Co and Al is enough to suppress the effect which questions about the anatomy of the torque action clearly behaving differently than in the standard way. This work opens new routes to the engineering of spintronic devices.

Title: Real-time simulations of laser-induced electron excitations in crystalline ZnO
Authors: Xiao Chen, Thomas Lettau, Ulf Peschel, Nicolas Tancogne-Dejean, Silvana Botti
Abstract: We investigate non-equilibrium electron dynamics in crystalline ZnO induced by ultrashort, relatively intense, infrared laser pulses. Our focus is on understanding the mechanism that facilitates efficient conduction band population in ZnO to enable optically pumped lasing. We consider two different pulse frequencies (in the near-infrared and mid-infrared) for which experimental data are available, and we calculate the electronic response of a ZnO crystal for a wide range of pulse intensities. We apply and compare three complementary theoretical approaches: the analytical Keldysh model, the numerical solution of the semiconductor Bloch equations, and real-time time-dependent density functional theory. We conclude that time-dependent density functional theory is a valid \textit{ab initio} approach for predicting conduction band population, that offers an accurate enough description of static and transient optical properties of solids and provides physics insight into the intermediate excitation regime, where electronic excitations are determined by the interplay of intraband tunneling, a consequence of band bending, and interband multi-photon absorption.

Title: Ion-Exchange Doping of Semiconducting Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes
Authors: Angus Hawkey, Aditya Dash, Xabier Rodríguez-Martínez, Zhiyong Zhao, Anna Champ, Sebastian Lindenthal, Michael Zharnikov, Martijn Kemerink, Jana Zaumseil
Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are a promising thermoelectric material with high power factors after chemical p- or n-doping. Understanding the impact of dopant counterions on charge transport and thermoelectric properties of nanotube networks is essential to further optimize doping methods and to develop better dopants. Here, we utilize ion-exchange doping to systematically vary the size of counterions in thin films of small and large diameter, polymer-sorted semiconducting SWCNTs with AuCl3 as the initial p-dopant and investigate the impact of ion size on conductivity, Seebeck coefficients and power factors. Larger anions are found to correlate with higher electrical conductivities and improved doping stability, while no significant effect on the power factors is found. Importantly, the effect of counterion size on the thermoelectric properties of dense SWCNT networks is not obscured by morphological changes upon doping. The observed trends of carrier mobilities and Seebeck coefficients can be explained by a random resistor model for the nanotube network that accounts for overlapping Coulomb potentials leading to the formation of an impurity band whose depth depends on the carrier density and counterion size. These insights can be applied more broadly to understand the thermoelectric properties of doped percolating disordered systems, including semiconducting polymers.

Title: Fluctuation Relations associated to an arbitrary bijection in path space
Authors: Raphael Chetrite, Stefano Marcantoni
Abstract: We introduce a framework to identify Fluctuation Relations for vector-valued observables in physical systems evolving through a stochastic dynamics. These relations arise from the particular structure of a suitable entropic functional and are induced by transformations in trajectory space that are invertible but are not involutions, typical examples being spatial rotations and translations. In doing so, we recover as particular cases results known in the literature as isometric fluctuation relations or spatial fluctuation relations and moreover we provide a recipe to find new ones. We mainly discuss two case studies, namely stochastic processes described by a canonical path probability and non degenerate diffusion processes. In both cases we provide sufficient conditions for the fluctuation relation to hold, considering either finite time or asymptotically large times.

Title: Impact of the Intraspecies Scattering Length on the Observability of Resonances in Efimov-Unfavored Systems
Authors: Karim I. Elghazawy, Chris H. Greene
Abstract: Efimov resonances in the three-body loss rate have been observed in ultracold heteronuclear gases near interspecies Feshbach resonances. However, the intraspecies scattering length $a_\text{BB}$ has been assumed to have a negligible effect on the overall Efimov scenario, namely, on the locations of the Efimov resonances $a_{-}^{(n)}$ and, consequently, on the three-body parameter (3BP). The present Letter analyzes the influence of $a_\text{BB}$ on the Efimov resonance positions $a_{-}^{(n)}$, particularly the 3BP, in Efimov-unfavored systems. Using van der Waals interactions described by separable $s$-wave potentials, the unitarity energy spectrum ($|a_\text{BX}|\rightarrow\infty$) and the Efimov resonance positions $a_{-}^{(n)}$ for $^{23}\text{Na}_2^{40}\text{K}$ are mapped out in $a_\text{BB}$. It is found that both the magnitude and sign of $a_\text{BB}$ can significantly impact the resonances $a_{-}^{(n)}$ in Efimov-unfavored systems, with the 3BP taking an observable value when $a_\text{BB}<0$.

Title: Spontaneous vortex-antivortex lattice and Majorana fermions in rhombohedral graphene
Authors: Filippo Gaggioli, Daniele Guerci, Liang Fu
Abstract: The discovery of superconducting states in multilayer rhombohedral graphene with spin and valley polarization has raised an interesting question: how does superconductivity cope with time-reversal symmetry breaking? %In the normal state, spin and valley polarization break time-reversal symmetry, while trigonal warping enforces $C_{3z}$. Below the critical temperature, the superconducting phase displays signatures of chiral behavior and is stabilized by out-of-plane fields as large as $\sim 0.5\,\text{T}$. In this work, using Ginzburg-Landau theory and microscopic calculation, we predict the existence of a new superconducting state at low electron density, which exhibits a spontaneously formed lattice of vortices and antivortices hosting Majorana zero-modes in their cores. We further identify this vortex-antivortex lattice (VAL) state in the experimental phase diagram and describe its experimental manifestations.

Title: Phonons in Electron Crystals with Berry Curvature
Authors: Junkai Dong, Ophelia Evelyn Sommer, Tomohiro Soejima, Daniel E. Parker, Ashvin Vishwanath
Abstract: Recent advances in 2D materials featuring nonzero Berry curvature have inspired extensions of the Wigner crystallization paradigm. This paper derives a low-energy effective theory for such quantum crystals, including the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) with nonzero Chern number. First we show that the low frequency dispersion of phonons in AHC, despite the presence of Berry curvature, resembles that of the zero field (rather than finite magnetic field) Wigner crystal due to the commutation of translation generators. We explain how key parameters of the phonon theory such as elastic constants and effective mass can be extracted from microscopic models, and apply them to two families of models: the recently introduced $\lambda$-jellium model and a model of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In the $\lambda$-jellium model, we explore the energy landscape as crystal geometry shifts, revealing that AHC can become "soft" under certain conditions. This causes transitions in lattice geometry, although the quantized Hall response remains unchanged. Surprisingly, the Berry curvature seems to enhance the effective mass, leading to a reduction in phonon speed. For the AHC in RMG, we obtain estimates of phonon speed and shear stiffness. We also identify a previously overlooked "kineo-elastic" term in the phonon effective action that is present in the symmetry setting of RMG, and leads to dramatic differences in phonon speeds in opposite directions. We numerically confirm these predictions of the effective actions by time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations. Our work points to the wealth of new phenomena that can arise when electron crystallization occurs in the presence of band geometry and topology.

Title: Intrinsic superconducting diode effect and nonreciprocal superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene multilayers
Authors: Yinqi Chen, Constantin Schrade
Abstract: Rhombohedral tetralayer graphene has recently emerged as an exciting platform for a possible chiral superconducting state. Here, we theoretically demonstrate and study the emergence of nonreciprocal superconductivity and an intrinsic superconducting diode effect in this system. Our results are based on a fully self-consistent framework for determining the superconducting order parameter from a Kohn-Luttinger mechanism to superconductivity and show that large diode efficiencies, $\sim$ 60%, are achievable and highly tunable by an external displacement field. Moreover, we also find that the diodicity shows a characteristic angular dependence with multiple enhanced lobes, which depend on the Fermi surface structure of the underlying normal state. Hence, our results suggest that the intrinsic superconducting diode effect could provide insights into the type of Fermi surface topology from which superconductivity arises.

Title: Simultaneous transport and tunneling spectroscopy of moiré graphene: Distinct observation of the superconducting gap and signatures of nodal superconductivity
Authors: Jeong Min Park, Shuwen Sun, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero
Abstract: Understanding the nature of superconductivity in magic-angle graphene remains challenging. A key difficulty lies in discerning the different energy scales in this strongly interacting system, particularly the superconducting gap. Here, we report the first simultaneous tunneling spectroscopy and transport measurements of magic-angle graphene, providing a novel approach to probe the superconducting state. This approach allows us to identify two coexisting V-shaped tunneling gaps with different energy scales: a distinct low-energy superconducting gap that vanishes at the superconducting critical temperature and magnetic field, and a higher-energy pseudogap. The superconducting tunneling spectra display a linear gap-filling behavior with temperature and magnetic field and exhibit the Volovik effect, consistent with a nodal order parameter. Our work reveals the unconventional nature of the superconducting gap in magic-angle graphene and establishes an experimental framework for multidimensional investigation of tunable quantum materials.

Title: Current and quantum transport factor of fermionic system in fermionic bath
Authors: Jayarshi Bhattacharya, Gautam Gangopadhyay, Sunandan Gangopadhyay
Abstract: This paper explores the dynamics of current and the quantum transport factor in a fermionic system with a central oscillator interacting with two fermionic reservoirs at different temperatures. We derive the master equation for the system density matrix, accounting for energy exchange between the system and the reservoirs. The current is analyzed in relation to system parameters and reservoir temperatures, revealing that the quantum transport factor differs from classical systems, approaching Carnot efficiency at high temperatures but being different at low temperatures. We also examine the power spectrum of the current, providing insights into current fluctuations and their temperature dependence. Furthermore, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation and the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation, where the steady-state probability distribution takes a Gaussian form, confirming the system behaves like a harmonic oscillator. This work advances the understanding of quantum transport in fermionic systems and provides a foundation for future research in quantum thermodynamics.

Title: The category of anyon sectors for non-abelian quantum double models
Authors: Alex Bols, Mahdie Hamdan, Pieter Naaijkens, Siddharth Vadnerkar
Abstract: We study Kitaev's quantum double model for arbitrary finite gauge group in infinite volume, using an operator-algebraic approach. The quantum double model hosts anyonic excitations which can be identified with equivalence classes of `localized and transportable endomorphisms', which produce anyonic excitations from the ground state. Following the Doplicher--Haag--Roberts (DHR) sector theory from AQFT, we organize these endomorphisms into a braided monoidal category capturing the fusion and braiding properties of the anyons. We show that this category is equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}_f \mathcal{D}(G)$, the representation category of the quantum double of $G$. This establishes for the first time the full DHR structure for a class of 2d quantum lattice models with non-abelian anyons.

Title: Unification of observational entropy with maximum entropy principles
Authors: Joseph Schindler, Philipp Strasberg, Niklas Galke, Andreas Winter, Michael G. Jabbour
Abstract: We introduce a definition of coarse-grained entropy that unifies measurement-based (observational entropy) and max-entropy-based (Jaynes) approaches to coarse-graining, by identifying physical constraints with information theoretic priors. The definition is shown to include as special cases most other entropies of interest in physics. We then consider second laws, showing that the definition admits new entropy increase theorems and connections to thermodynamics. We survey mathematical properties of the definition, and show it resolves some pathologies of the traditional observational entropy in infinite dimensions. Finally, we study the dynamics of this entropy in a quantum random matrix model and a classical hard sphere gas. Together the results suggest that this generalized observational entropy can form the basis of a highly general approach to statistical mechanics.

Title: Noise equals endogenous control
Authors: Eric De Giuli
Abstract: Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of endogenous control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, control is optimal and an exact mathematical mapping from noise to control is described, where the maximizing the probability of a state becomes the control objective. In Langevin dynamics noise is identified directly with control, while in general Markov jump processes, which include chemical reaction networks and electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Zel'dovich-Grassberger-Goldenfeld-Peliti path integral to identify the `response' or `tilt' field $\pi$ as control, which is proportional to the noise in the semiclassical limit. This solves the longstanding problem of interpreting $\pi$. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks and systems with unstable fixed points. The noise-control mapping builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why the probability is generically a non-smooth function of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agentic behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.

Title: Universal fault tolerant quantum computation in 2D without getting tied in knots
Authors: Margarita Davydova, Andreas Bauer, Julio C. Magdalena de la Fuente, Mark Webster, Dominic J. Williamson, Benjamin J. Brown
Abstract: We show how to perform scalable fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates in two dimensions by introducing domain walls between the surface code and a non-Abelian topological code whose codespace is stabilized by Clifford operators. We formulate a path integral framework which provides both a macroscopic picture for different logical gates as well as a way to derive the associated microscopic circuits. We also show an equivalence between our approach and prior proposals where a 2D array of qubits reproduces the action of a transversal gate in a 3D stabilizer code over time, thus, establishing a new connection between 3D codes and 2D non-Abelian topological phases. We prove a threshold theorem for our protocols under local stochastic circuit noise using a just-in-time decoder to correct the non-Abelian code.

Title: Monte Carlo study on Heisenberg model with local dipolar interaction
Authors: Etsuko Itou, Akira Matsumoto, Yu Nakayama, Toshiki Onagi
Abstract: Aharony and Fisher showed that non-local dipolar effects in magnetism destabilize the Heisenberg fixed point in real ferromagnets, leading to a new fixed point, called the dipolar fixed point. The non-perturbative nature of the new fixed point, however, has not been uncovered for many decades. Inspired by the recent understanding that the dipolar fixed point is scale-invariant but not conformal invariant, we perform the Monte Carlo simulation of the local Heisenberg-dipolar model on the lattice of $40^3$ by introducing the local cost function parameterized by a parameter $\lambda$ and study its critical exponents, which should become identical to the dipolar fixed point of Aharony and Fisher in the infinite coupling limit $\lambda = \infty$. We find that the critical exponents become noticeably different from those of the Heisenberg fixed point for a finite coupling constant $\lambda=8$ (e.g. $\nu=0.601(2)(^{+0}_{-2})$ in the local Heisenberg-dipolar model while $\nu=0.712(1)(^{+3}_{-0})$ in the Heisenberg model), and the spin correlation function has a feature that it becomes divergence-free, implying the lack of conformal invariance.

Title: Information maximization for a broad variety of multi-armed bandit games
Authors: Alex Barbier-Chebbah (EPIMETHEE), Christian L. Vestergaard (EPIMETHEE), Jean-Baptiste Masson (EPIMETHEE)
Abstract: Information and free-energy maximization are physics principles that provide general rules for an agent to optimize actions in line with specific goals and policies. These principles are the building blocks for designing decision-making policies capable of efficient performance with only partial information. Notably, the information maximization principle has shown remarkable success in the classical bandit problem and has recently been shown to yield optimal algorithms for Gaussian and sub-Gaussian reward distributions. This article explores a broad extension of physics-based approaches to more complex and structured bandit problems. To this end, we cover three distinct types of bandit problems, where information maximization is adapted and leads to strong performance. Since the main challenge of information maximization lies in avoiding over-exploration, we highlight how information is tailored at various levels to mitigate this issue, paving the way for more efficient and robust decision-making strategies.

Title: Simultaneous active and diffusive behaviour of asymmetric microclusters in a photophoretic trap
Authors: Anita Pahi, Kirty Ranjan Sahoo, Biswajit Das, Shuvojit Paul, Ayan Banerjee
Abstract: Active and diffusive motion in Brownian particles are regularly observed in fluidic environments, albeit at different time scales. Here, we experimentally study the dynamics of highly asymmetric microclusters trapped in air employing photophoretic forces generated from a loosely focused laser beam, where the trapped particles display active and diffusive dynamics simultaneously in orthogonal spatial directions. Thus, particle motion in the longitudinal direction ($z$) is enslaved to irregular kicks that naturally arise from an interplay of gravitational and photophoretic forces. This leads to a bimodal nature of the probability distribution function with a near-ballistic scaling of mean-squared displacement in the $z$ direction demonstrating active like dynamics, while the dynamics along the transverse ($x$) direction displays diffusive behaviour with a strong dependence on the motion along $z$. To explain these unique characteristics, we developed a 2D-Langevin model of a confined elliptic particle experiencing an additional stochastic force along $z$ to account for the arbitrary jumps. The numerical results show excellent qualitative agreement with the experimental observations. Our findings should pave the way for the design of high-efficiency Brownian engines in air, besides stimulating new research in the emerging field of photophoretic trapping.

Title: Hydrodynamic Interactions in Particle Suspensions: A Perspective on Stokesian Dynamics
Authors: Kim William Torre, Joost de Graaf
Abstract: Stokesian Dynamics (SD) is a numerical framework used for simulating hydrodynamic interactions in particle suspensions at low Reynolds number. It combines far-field approximations with near-field lubrication corrections, offering a balance between accuracy and efficiency. This work reviews SD and provides a perspective on future directions for this approach. We outline the mathematical foundations, the method's strengths and weaknesses, and the computational challenges that need to be overcome to work with SD effectively. We also discuss recent advancements that improve the algorithm's efficiency, including the use of iterative solvers and matrix-free approaches. In addition, we highlight the limitations of making stronger, albeit more cost-effective approximations to studying hydrodynamic interactions in dense suspensions than made in SD, such as the two-body Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) approximation. To overcome these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that replaces SD's full many-body computations with a neural network trained on SD data. That is, we correct the RPY approximation, while avoiding costly matrix inversions. We demonstrate the potential of this method on a simple system, where we find a close match to SD data while algorithmically outperforming RPY. Our work provides an outlook on the way in which large-scale simulations of particle suspensions can be performed in the foreseeable future.

Title: Event Soliton Formation in Mixed Energy-Momentum Gaps of Nonlinear Spacetime Crystals
Authors: Liang Zhang, Zhiwei Fan, Yiming Pan
Abstract: We report the formation of a novel soliton, termed event soliton, in nonlinear photonic spacetime crystals (STCs). In these media, simultaneous spatiotemporal periodic modulation of the dielectric constant generates mixed frequency (${\omega}$) and wavevector (k) gaps. Under Kerr nonlinearity, the event solitons emerge as fully localized entities in both spacetime and energy-momentum domains, providing a tangible demonstration of the concept of event in relativity. The ${\omega}$k-gap mixture arises from the coexistence and competition between time reflected and Bragg reflected waves due to the spatiotemporal modulation. We propose a new partial differential equation to capture various spatiotemporal patterns and present numerical simulations to validate our theoretical predictions, reflecting a three-way balance among k-gap opening, ${\omega}$-gap opening, and nonlinearity. Our work opens avenues for fundamental studies and fosters experimental prospects for implementing spacetime crystals in both time-varying photonics and periodically driven condensed matter systems.

Title: Filters reveal emergent structure in computational morphogenesis
Authors: Hazhir Aliahmadi, Aidan Sheedy, Greg van Anders
Abstract: Revolutionary advances in both manufacturing and computational morphogenesis raise critical questions about design sensitivity. Sensitivity questions are especially critical in contexts, such as topology optimization, that yield structures with emergent morphology. However, analyzing emergent structures via conventional, perturbative techniques can mask larger-scale vulnerabilities that could manifest in essential components. Risks that fail to appear in perturbative sensitivity analyses will only continue to proliferate as topology optimization-driven manufacturing penetrates more deeply into engineering design and consumer products. Here, we introduce Laplace-transform based computational filters that supplement computational morphogenesis with a set of nonperturbative sensitivity analyses. We demonstrate how this approach identifies important elements of a structure even in the absence of knowledge of the ultimate, optimal structure itself. We leverage techniques from molecular dynamics and implement these methods in open-source codes, demonstrating their application to compliance minimization problems in both 2D and 3D. Our implementation extends straightforwardly to topology optimization for other problems and benefits from the strong scaling properties observed in conventional molecular simulation.

Title: Uni-3DAR: Unified 3D Generation and Understanding via Autoregression on Compressed Spatial Tokens
Authors: Shuqi Lu, Haowei Lin, Lin Yao, Zhifeng Gao, Xiaohong Ji, Weinan E, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models and their multi-modal extensions have demonstrated the effectiveness of unifying generation and understanding through autoregressive next-token prediction. However, despite the critical role of 3D structural generation and understanding ({3D GU}) in AI for science, these tasks have largely evolved independently, with autoregressive methods remaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-3DAR, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates {3D GU} tasks via autoregressive prediction. At its core, Uni-3DAR employs a novel hierarchical tokenization that compresses 3D space using an octree, leveraging the inherent sparsity of 3D structures. It then applies an additional tokenization for fine-grained structural details, capturing key attributes such as atom types and precise spatial coordinates in microscopic 3D structures. We further propose two optimizations to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The first is a two-level subtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. The second is a masked next-token prediction mechanism tailored for dynamically varying token positions, significantly boosting model performance. By combining these strategies, Uni-3DAR successfully unifies diverse {3D GU} tasks within a single autoregressive framework. Extensive experiments across multiple microscopic {3D GU} tasks, including molecules, proteins, polymers, and crystals, validate its effectiveness and versatility. Notably, Uni-3DAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion models by a substantial margin, achieving up to 256\% relative improvement while delivering inference speeds up to 21.8x faster. The code is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Hamiltonian dynamics of classical spins
Authors: Slobodan Radoševi\' c, Sonja Gombar, Milica Rutonjski, Petar Mali, Milan Panti\' c, Milica Pavkov-Hrvojevi\' c
Abstract: We discuss the geometry behind classical Heisenberg model at the level suitable for third or fourth year students who did not have the opportunity to take a course on differential geometry. The arguments presented here rely solely on elementary algebraic concepts such as vectors, dual vectors and tensors, as well as Hamiltonian equations and Poisson brackets in their simplest form. We derive Poisson brackets for classical spins, along with the corresponding equations of motion for classical Heisenberg model, starting from the geometry of two-sphere, thereby demonstrating the relevance of standard canonical procedure in the case of Heisenberg model.

Title: Many exact area-law scar eigenstates in the nonintegrable PXP and related models
Authors: Andrew N. Ivanov, Olexei I. Motrunich
Abstract: In this work, we present new, highly non-trivial area-law exact zero-energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional (1D) PXP and related models. We formulate sufficient conditions for a matrix product state to represent an exact zero-energy eigenstate of a given 1D kinetically constrained model and use them to prove our new states. We also demonstrate that all previously known exact eigenstates of PXP-type models satisfy these conditions, and, in fact, can be directly deduced from them. We discuss and demonstrate a remarkably effective general numerical technique for discovering finite-bond-dimension eigenstates residing in degenerate subspaces of a broad class of Hamiltonians. Our results highlight a previously unrecognized structure characteristic of the exponentially large nullspaces in kinetically constrained models, suggesting the possibly of extensively many increasingly complex area-law zero-energy eigenstates in the thermodynamic limit. The important implications of these emergent exact eigenstates for the general thermalization phenomenology are exemplified by one of the states introduced in this work, which we propose is a member of the primary $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum many-body scar tower responsible for long-lived revivals in the Rydberg atom chain experiment.

Title: Bandgap-Dependent Doping of Semiconducting Carbon Nanotube Networks by Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer for Stable Thermoelectrics
Authors: Angus Hawkey, Xabier Rodríguez-Martínez, Sebastian Lindenthal, Moritz C. F. Jansen, Reverant Crispin, Jana Zaumseil
Abstract: Networks of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are a promising material for thermoelectric energy harvesting due to their mechanical flexibility, solution processability, high Seebeck coefficients and high electrical conductivities after chemical p- or n-doping. Here, we demonstrate that proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) with benzoquinone (BQ) as the oxidant and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li[TFSI]) for electrolyte counterions is a promising method for p-doping of polymer-sorted semiconducting SWNT networks. The achieved doping levels, as determined from absorption bleaching, depend directly on both the pH of the aqueous doping solutions and the bandgap (i.e., diameter) of the nanotubes within the network. Fast screening of different nanotube networks under various doping conditions was enabled by a high-throughput setup for thermoelectric measurements of five samples in parallel. For small-bandgap SWNTs, PCET-doping is sufficient to reach the maximum thermoelectric power factors, which are equal to those obtained by conventional methods. In contrast to other doping methods, the electrical conductivity of PCET-doped SWNTs remains stable over at least 5 days in air. These results confirm PCET to be a suitable approach for more environmentally friendly and stable doping of semiconducting SWNTs as promising thermoelectric materials.

Title: Modular transport in two-dimensional conformal field theory
Authors: Mihail Mintchev, Diego Pontello, Erik Tonni
Abstract: We study the quantum transport generated by the bipartite entanglement in two-dimensional conformal field theory at finite density with the $U(1) \times U(1)$ symmetry associated to the conservation of the electric charge and of the helicity. The bipartition given by an interval is considered, either on the line or on the circle. The continuity equations and the corresponding conserved quantities for the modular flows of the currents and of the energy-momentum tensor are derived. We investigate the mean values of the associated currents and their quantum fluctuations in the finite density representation, which describe the properties of the modular quantum transport. The modular analogues of the Johnson-Nyquist law and of the fluctuation-dissipation relation are found, which encode the thermal nature of the modular evolution.

Title: Non-Markovian Relaxation Spectroscopy of Fluxonium Qubits
Authors: Ze-Tong Zhuang, Dario Rosenstock, Bao-Jie Liu, Aaron Somoroff, Vladimir E. Manucharyan, Chen Wang
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that parasitic two-level systems (TLS) in superconducting qubits, which are a leading source of decoherence, can have relaxation times longer than the qubits themselves. However, the standard techniques used to characterize qubit relaxation is only valid for measuring $T_1$ under Markovian assumptions and could mask such non-Markovian behavior of the environment in practice. Here, we introduce two-timescale relaxometry, a technique to probe the qubit and environment relaxation simultaneously and efficiently. We apply it to high-coherence fluxonium qubits over a frequency range of 0.1-0.4 GHz, which reveals a discrete spectrum of TLS with millisecond lifetimes. Our analysis of the spectrum is consistent with a random distribution of TLS in the aluminum oxide tunnel barrier of the Josephson junction chain of the fluxonium with an average density and electric dipole similar to previous TLS studies at much higher frequencies. Our study suggests that investigating and mitigating TLS in the junction chain is crucial to the development of various types of noise-protected qubits in circuit QED.

Title: Using Targeted Phonon Excitation to Modulate Thermal Conductivity of Boron Nitride
Authors: Dongkai Pan, Xiao Wan, Tianhao Li, Zhicheng Zong, Yangjun Qin, Nuo Yang
Abstract: Recent advancements in thermal conductivity modulating strategies have shown promising enhancements to the thermal management capabilities of two-dimensional materials. In this article, both iterative Boltzmann transport equation solution and two-temperature model were employed to investigate the efficacy of targeted phonon excitation applied to hexagonal boron nitride. The results indicate significant modifications to hBN's thermal conductivity, achieving increases of up to 30.1% as well as decreases of up to 59.8%. These findings validate the reliability of the strategy, expand its scope of applicability, and establish it as a powerful tool for tailoring thermal properties across a wider range of fields.

Title: First passage times in compact domains exhibit bi-scaling
Authors: Talia Baravi, David A. Kessler, Eli Barkai
Abstract: The study of first passage times for diffusing particles reaching target states is foundational in various practical applications, including diffusion-controlled reactions. In this work, we present a bi-scaling theory for the probability density function of first passage times in confined compact processes, applicable to both Euclidean and Fractal domains, diverse geometries, and scenarios with or without external force fields, accommodating Markovian and semi-Markovian random walks. In large systems, first passage time statistics exhibit a bi-scaling behavior, challenging the use of a single time scale. Our theory employs two distinct scaling functions: one for short times, capturing initial dynamics in unbounded systems, and the other for long times is sensitive to finite size effects. The combined framework provides a complete expression for first passage time statistics across all time scales.

Title: Entanglement Rényi Negativity of Interacting Fermions from Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations
Authors: Fo-Hong Wang, Xiao Yan Xu
Abstract: Many-body entanglement unveils additional aspects of quantum matter and offers insights into strongly correlated physics. While ground-state entanglement has received much attention in the past decade, the study of mixed-state quantum entanglement using negativity in interacting fermionic systems remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate that the partially transposed density matrix of interacting fermions, similar to their reduced density matrix, can be expressed as a weighted sum of Gaussian states describing free fermions, enabling the calculation of rank-$n$ Rényi negativity within the determinant quantum Monte Carlo framework. We calculate the rank-two Rényi negativity for the half-filled Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model. Our calculation reveals that the area law coefficient of the Rényi negativity for the spinless $t$-$V$ model has a logarithmic finite-size scaling at the finite-temperature transition point. Our work contributes to the calculation of entanglement and sets the stage for future studies on quantum entanglement in various fermionic many-body mixed states.

Title: Energy Window Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW)
Authors: Garry Goldstein
Abstract: In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids aimed at applications to Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In this construction we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the eigenstates of a final Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian matrix - that is iterate solve the KS equations till the eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian matrix also give the appropriate electron density needed to obtain the KS potential needed for that KS Hamiltonian matrix. Here we propose that, for the basis used at each step of the iteration, we use the previous eigenstate basis, in the interstitial region, but augmented inside the Muffin Tin (MT) sphere with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the energy window of the energy of that eigenstate. Indeed to reduce the number of times the spherically averaged KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous to use energy windows and solve the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window (at the energy relevant to that window) so that the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian needs only be solved a small number of times per iteration of the solution of the KS equations. For practical applications it is reasonable to have on the order of ten to one hundred windows. This method combines the implicit energy dependence of the basis of methods such as Projected Augmented Wave functions (PAW) with the ability of the basis set to adjust to the solid state (rather then atomic) environment which is similar to basis sets such as Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (LAPW). At each step of the iteration of the solution of the KS equations the basis is that of near eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian for that iteration.

Title: Unprecedented Fractional Magnetization Plateaus in a New Shastry-Sutherland Ising Compound
Authors: Lalit Yadav, Afonso Rufino, Rabindranath Bag, Matthew Ennis, Jan Alexander Koziol, Clarina dela Cruz, Alexander I. Kolesnikov, V. Ovidiu Garlea, Keith M. Taddei, David Graf, Kai Phillip Schmidt, Frédéric Mila, Sara Haravifard
Abstract: Geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, such as those based on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL), offer a rich playground for exploring unconventional magnetic states. The delicate balance between competing interactions in these systems leads to the emergence of novel phases. We present the characterization of Er2Be2GeO7, an SSL compound with Er3+ ions forming orthogonal dimers separated by non-magnetic layers whose structure is invariant under the P-421m space group. Neutron scattering reveals an antiferromagnetic dimer structure at zero field, typical of Ising spins on that lattice and consistent with the anisotropic magnetization observed. However, magnetization measurements exhibit fractional plateaus at 1/4 and 1/2 of saturation, in contrast to the expected 1/3 plateau of the SSL Ising model. By comparing the energy of candidate states with ground-state lower bounds we show that this behavior requires spatially anisotropic interactions, leading to an anisotropic Shastry-Sutherland Ising Model (ASSLIM) symmetric under the Cmm2 space group. This anisotropy is consistent with the small orthorhombic distortion observed with single-crystal neutron diffraction. The other properties, including thermodynamics, which have been investigated theoretically using tensor networks, point to small residual interactions, potentially due to further couplings and quantum fluctuations. This study highlights Er2Ge2GeO7 as a promising platform for investigating exotic magnetic phenomena.

Title: A non-orthogonal representation of the chemical space
Authors: Tiago F. T. Cerqueira, Haichen Wang, Silvana Botti, Miguel A. L. Marques
Abstract: We present a novel approach to generate a fingerprint for crystalline materials that balances efficiency for machine processing and human interpretability, allowing its application in both machine learning inference and understanding of structure-property relationships. Our proposed material encoding has two components: one representing the crystal structure and the other characterizing the chemical composition, that we call Pettifor embedding. For the latter we construct a non-orthogonal space where each axis represents a chemical element and where the angle between the axes quantifies a measure of the similarity between them. The chemical composition is then defined by the point on the unit sphere in this non-orthogonal space. We show that the Pettifor embeddings systematically outperform other commonly used elemental embeddings in compositional machine learning models. Using the Pettifor embeddings to define a distance metric and applying dimension reduction techniques, we construct a two-dimensional global map of the space of thermodynamically stable crystalline compounds. Despite their simplicity, such maps succeed in providing a physical separation of material classes according to basic physical properties.

Title: Hydrodynamics as the effective field theory of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking
Authors: Xiaoyang Huang, Marvin Qi, Jian-Hao Zhang, Andrew Lucas
Abstract: Inspired by the hunt for new phases of matter in quantum mixed states, it has recently been proposed that the equivalence of microcanonical and canonical ensembles in statistical mechanics is a manifestation of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in an underlying many-body quantum description. Here, we build an effective field theory for SWSSB of a global U(1) symmetry; the answer exactly reproduces the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory of diffusion for the conserved charge. We conclude that hydrodynamics can be understood as a theory of "superfluidity" for the broken strong symmetry: a non-vanishing susceptibility is a measurable order parameter for SWSSB, the diffusion mode is the Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, and a generalization of Goldstone's Theorem implies that the diffusion mode is always long-lived. This perspective provides a transparent physical explanation for the unusual "reparameterization" symmetries which are a necessary ingredient of Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories for "normal fluids".

Title: Activity leads to topological phase transition in 2D populations of heterogeneous oscillators
Authors: Ylann Rouzaire, Parisa Rahmani, Ignacio Pagonabarraga, Fernando Peruani, Demian Levis
Abstract: Populations of heterogeneous, noisy oscillators on a two-dimensional lattice display short-range order. Here, we show that if the oscillators are allowed to actively move in space, the system undergoes instead a Berezenskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and exhibits quasi-long-range order. This fundamental result connects two paradigmatic models -- XY and Kuramoto model -- and provides insight on the emergence of order in active systems.

Title: Synthetic half-integer magnetic monopole and single-vortex dynamics in spherical Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Xi-Yu Chen, Lijia Jiang, Wen-Kai Bai, Tao Yang, Jun-Hui Zheng
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles are crucial in explaining the quantization of electric charges and quantum Hall effects, while artificially creating a minimal magnetic monopole in experiments remains a challenge. Here, we come up with a flexible way to simulate a half-integer-type monopole in Bose gases and investigate the induced vortex dynamics on a sphere. We list the possible experiment parameter settings for different isotopes and discuss their experimental feasibility. With the assumption of a rigid monopole-vortex structure, we analytically predict the vortex trajectory in an external magnetic field. We then confirm the result by numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which employs two gauges simultaneously (the Wu-Yang approach) to prevent singularity in the one-gauge method when a monopole is present. The study offers significant insight into the characteristics of monopoles and vortices, facilitating avenues for experimental validation.

Title: Strain rate sensitivity of a Cu/Al$_2$O$_3$ multi-layered thin film
Authors: Szilvia Kalácska, László Pethő, Guillaume Kermouche, Johann Michler, Péter Dusán Ispánovity
Abstract: To study the size and strain rate dependency of copper polycrystalline microstructures, a multi-layered copper/Al$_2$O$_3$ thin film was deposited on a Si substrate using a hybrid deposition system (combining physical vapour and atomic layer deposition). High temperature treatment was applied on the ``As Deposited" material with ultrafine-grained structure to increase the average grain size, resulting in a ``Heat Treated" state with microcrystalline structure. Focused ion beam milling was employed to create square shaped micropillars with two different sizes, that were subjected to compressive loading at various (0.001/s -- 1000/s) strain rates. Differences in the strain rate sensitivity behavior manifesting at low and high strain rates are discussed in the context of the pillar diameters and the grain size of the deformed samples. The Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayer studied by transmission electron microscopy showed excellent thermal stability and grain boundary pinning by precipitation, also resulting in the homogeneous deformation of the pillars and preventing shear localization. Geometrically necessary dislocation densities estimated by high (angular) resolution electron backscatter diffraction presented inhomogeneous dislocation distribution within the deformed pillar volumes, that is attributed to the proximity of the sample edges. Finally, the Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayers successfully suppressed any possible recrystallization processes, contributing to the excellent film stability, that makes the proposed coating ideal to be operating under extreme conditions.

Title: Large positive magnetoconductance in carbon nanoscrolls
Authors: Yu-Jie Zhong, Jia-Cheng Li, Xuan-Fu Huang, Ying-Je Lee, Ting-Zhen Chen, Jia-Ren Zhang, Angus Huang, Hsiu-Chuan Hsu, Carmine Ortix, Ching-Hao Chang
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild inter-turn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.

Title: Entanglement of Disjoint Intervals in Dual-Unitary Circuits: Exact Results
Authors: Alessandro Foligno, Bruno Bertini
Abstract: The growth of the entanglement between two disjoint intervals and its complement after a quantum quench is regarded as a dynamical chaos indicator. Namely, it is expected to show qualitatively different behaviours depending on whether the underlying microscopic dynamics is chaotic or integrable. So far, however, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field theories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class of interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary circuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of conserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that, for almost all dual unitary circuits on qubits and for a large family of dual-unitary circuits on qudits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics agrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we require the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement displays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems. Interestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving dual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.

Title: Boltzmann Sampling by Diabatic Quantum Annealing
Authors: Ju-Yeon Gyhm, Gilhan Kim, Hyukjoon Kwon, Yongjoo Baek
Abstract: It has been proposed that diabatic quantum annealing (DQA), which turns off the transverse field at a finite speed, produces samples well described by the Boltzmann distribution. We analytically show that, up to linear order in quenching time, the DQA approximates a high-temperature Boltzmann distribution. Our theory yields an explicit relation between the quenching rate of the DQA and the temperature of the Boltzmann distribution. Based on this result, we discuss how the DQA can be utilized to train the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM).

Title: Mind the memory: Consistent time reversal removes artefactual scaling of energy dissipation rate and provides more accurate and reliable thermodynamic inference
Authors: Tassilo Schwarz, Anatoly B. Kolomeisky, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: It has been proposed that an observed inverse power-law dependence of the Markovian estimate for the steady-state dissipation rate on the coarse-graining scale in self-similar networks reflects a scale-dependent energy dissipation. By explicit examples, it is demonstrated here that there are in general no relations between such an apparent power-law dependence and the actual dissipation on different length scales. We construct fractal networks with a single dissipative scale and networks with a true inverse energy-dissipation cascade, and show that they display the same scaling behavior. Moreover, we show that a self-similar network structure does not imply an inverse power-law scaling but may be mistaken for one in practice. When no dissipative cycles become hidden by the coarse graining, any scale dependence of the dissipation estimate vanishes if the memory is correctly accounted for in the time-reversal operation. A $k$-th order estimator is derived and necessary and sufficient conditions are proved for a guaranteed lower bound on dissipation. These higher-order estimators saturated in the order are proved to provide sharper lower bounds on dissipation and their scale dependence signifies hidden dissipative cycles. It is shown that estimators not saturated in the order may erroneously overestimate the microscopic dissipation. Our results underscore the still underappreciated importance of correctly accounting for memory in analyzing coarse observations.

Title: Finite-Momentum Pairing State in Unconventional Rashba Systems
Authors: Ran Wang, Song-Bo Zhang, Ning Hao
Abstract: In systems with unconventional Rashba bands, we propose that a finite-momentum pairing state can emerge without the need for an external magnetic field. We analyze the phase transition from a zero-momentum Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state to a finite-momentum pairing state using a microscopic interaction model. We demonstrate that the coexistence of zero-momentum and Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO)-type pairings in different channels provides a well understanding of recent experimental observations of pair-density-wave (PDW) states. Furthermore, we propose that an s-wave BCS superconductor-unconventional Rashba metal (SC-URM) junction can generate an LO-type pairing state via an orbital-selective proximity effect. This nontrivial state can be detected by measuring the Josephson current in an SC-URM-SC junction or through Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy/spectrosscopy (JSTM/S). Our results reveal that the internal multi-orbital degrees of freedom play a crucial role in facilitating finite-momentum pairing states.

Title: Comment on the Author Correction to "Magnetic flux trapping in hydrogen-rich high-temperature superconductors", Nat Phys. 19, 1293 (2023), arXiv:2206.14108
Authors: N. Zen
Abstract: In Fig. 4c, under the section titled "Pinning and thermally activated motion of vortices" in arXiv:2206.14108 and Nat Phys. 19, 1293 (2023) [1], Minkov and co-workers presented the time dependence of the magnetic moment of sulfur hydride (H$_{3}$S) under high pressure and argued that they had observed magnetic flux creep at 165 K, 180 K and 185 K. Flux creep is a phenomenon observed under the assumption that the material under study can trap magnetic flux, and thus, Fig. 4c serves as evidence that H$_{3}$S traps magnetic flux and is a high-temperature superconductor. The claim remains unchanged even in the recently published Author Correction [2] to Ref. [1]. However, Ref. [2] discloses an experimental protocol they used to collect the time-dependent magnetic moment data. In this Matters Arising, we point out that the protocol is not applicable to H$_{3}$S under high pressure and propose an alternative protocol. The correct protocol demonstrates that the claim in Refs. [1,2] -- that their time-dependent magnetic moment data serve as evidence of "pinning and thermally activated motion of vortices" -- is invalid.

Title: Broken symmetry solutions in one-dimensional lattice models via many-body perturbation theory
Authors: Matteo Quinzi, Tommaso Chiarotti, Marco Gibertini, Andrea Ferretti
Abstract: In this work we study self-consistent solutions in one-dimensional lattice models obtained via many-body perturbation theory. The Dyson equation is solved in a fully self-consistent manner via the algorithmic-inversion method based on the sum-over-poles representation (AIM-SOP) of dynamical operators. In particular, we focus on the GW approximation, analyzing the spectral properties and the emergence of possible magnetic- or charge-density-wave broken symmetry solutions. We start by validating our self-consistent AIM-SOP implementation by taking as test case the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We then move to the study of antiferromagnetic and charge density wave solutions in one-dimensional lattice models, taking into account a long-range Coulomb interaction between the electrons. We show that moving from local to non-local electronic interactions leads to a competition between antiferromagnetic and charge-density-wave broken symmetry solutions. Complementary, by solving the Sham-Schlüter equation, we can compute the non-interacting Green's function reproducing the same charge density of the interacting system. In turn, this allows for the evaluation of the derivative discontinuity of the Kohn-Sham (KS) potential, showing that its contribution to the fundamental gap can become dominating in some of the studied cases.

Title: Non-perturbative self-consistent electron-phonon spectral functions and transport
Authors: Jae-Mo Lihm, Samuel Poncé
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling often dominates the electron spectral functions and carrier transport properties. However, studies of this effect in real materials have largely relied on perturbative one-shot methods due to the lack of a first-principles theoretical and computational framework. Here, we present a self-consistent theory and implementation for the non-perturbative calculations of spectral functions and conductivity due to electron-phonon coupling. Applying this method to monolayer InSe, we demonstrate that self-consistency qualitatively affects the spectral function and transport properties compared to state-of-the-art one-shot calculations and allow one to reconcile experimental angle-resolved photoemission experiments. The developed method can be widely applied to materials with dominant electron-phonon coupling at moderate computational cost.

Title: Quantitative Theory for Critical Conditions of Like-Charge Attraction Between Polarizable Spheres
Authors: Yanyu Duan, Zecheng Gan
Abstract: Despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts, a concise quantitative theory to predict the occurrence of like-charge attraction (LCA) between polarizable spheres remains elusive. In this work, we first derive a novel three-point image formula, based on a key observation that connects the classical Neumann's image principle with the incomplete beta function. This approach naturally yields simple yet precise critical conditions for LCA, with a relative discrepancy of less than $1\%$ compared to numerical simulations, validated across diverse parameter settings. The obtained critical conditions may provide physical insights into various processes potentially involving LCA, such as self-assembly, crystallization, and phase separation across different length scales. Additionally, the new image formula is directly applicable to enhance the efficiency of polarizable force field calculations involving polarizable spheres.

Title: Speedups in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation: Mpemba and related effects
Authors: Gianluca Teza, John Bechhoefer, Antonio Lasanta, Oren Raz, Marija Vucelja
Abstract: Most of our intuition about the behavior of physical systems is shaped by observations at or near thermal equilibrium. However, even a thermal quench can lead to states far from thermal equilibrium, where counterintuitive, anomalous effects can occur. A prime example of anomalous thermal relaxation is the Mpemba effect, in which a system prepared at a hot temperature cools down to the temperature of the cold environment faster than an identical system prepared at a warm temperature. Although reported for water more than 2000 years ago by Aristotle, the recent observations of analogous relaxation speedups in a variety of systems have motivated the search for general explanations. We review anomalous relaxation effects, which all share a nonmonotonic dependence of relaxation time versus initial ``distance" from the final state or from the phase transition. The final state can be an equilibrium or a nonequilibrium steady state. We first review the water experiments and classify the anomalous relaxation phenomena related to the Mpemba effect. We then provide a modern definition of the Mpemba effect, focusing on the theoretical frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, kinetic theory, Markovian dynamics, and phase transitions. We discuss the recent experimental and numerical developments that followed these theoretical advances. These developments paved the way for the prediction and observation of novel phenomena, such as the inverse Mpemba effect. The review is self-contained and introduces anomalous relaxation phenomena in single- and many-body systems, both classical and quantum. We also discuss the broader relevance of the Mpemba effect, including its relation with phase transitions and its experimental implications. We end with perspectives that connect anomalous speedups to ideas for designing optimal heating/cooling protocols, heat engines, and efficient samplers.

Title: Symmetry Analysis of the Non-Hermitian Electro-Optic Effect in Crystals
Authors: Sylvain Lannebère, Tatiana G. Rappoport, Tiago A. Morgado, Ivo Souza, Mário G. Silveirinha
Abstract: Here, we investigate how crystal symmetry tailors the non-Hermitian electro-optic effect arising from the Berry curvature dipole. Specifically, we demonstrate the critical influence of the material's point group symmetry and external electric biases in shaping this effect, leading to current-induced optical gain and non-reciprocal optical responses. Through a symmetry-based analysis of the crystallographic point groups, we identify how different symmetries affect the electro-optic response, enabling the engineering of polarization-dependent optical gain without the need for gyrotropic effects. In particular, we demonstrate that the non-Hermitian electro-optic response in a broad class of crystals is characterized by linear dichroic gain. In this type of response, the eigenpolarizations that activate the gain or dissipation are linearly polarized. Depending on the point group symmetry, it is possible to achieve gain (or dissipation) for all eigenpolarizations or to observe polarization-dependent gain and dissipation. Weyl semimetals emerge as promising candidates for realizing significant non-Hermitian electro-optic effects and linear dichroic gain. We further examine practical applications by studying the reflectance of biased materials in setups involving mirrors, demonstrating how optical gain and attenuation can be controlled via symmetry and bias configurations.

Title: Magneto-rotation coupling for ferromagnetic nanoelement embedded in elastic substrate
Authors: Grzegorz Centała, Jarosław W. Kłos
Abstract: This study investigates magneto-rotational coupling as a distinct contribution to magnetoelastic interactions, which can be influenced by magnetic anisotropy. We determine magneto-rotational coupling coefficients that incorporate the shape anisotropy of a magnetic nanoelement (strip) and demonstrate that this type of coupling can be modified through geometric adjustments. Furthermore, we analyze the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field in a ferromagnetic strip embedded in a nonmagnetic substrate. Both Rayleigh and Love waves are considered sources of the magnetoelastic field, and we examine how the strength of the magneto-rotational coupling varies with the direction of the in-plane applied magnetic field. We found that in the absence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field decreases with a reduction in the thickness-to-width ratio of the strip for a Rayleigh wave, whereas for a Love wave, it changes non-monotonically. These findings enhance the understanding of magneto-rotational coupling in magnonic nanostructures.

Title: Anti Kibble-Zurek behavior in the quantum XY spin-1/2 chain driven by correlated noisy magnetic field and anisotropy
Authors: S. Sadeghizade, R. Jafari, A. Langari
Abstract: In the non-adiabatic dynamics across a quantum phase transition, the Kibble-Zurek paradigm describes that the average number of topological defects is suppressed as a universal power law with the quench time scale. A conflicting observation, which termed anti-Kibble-Zurek dynamics has been reported in several studies, specifically in the driven systems with an uncorrelated stochastic (white) noise. Here, we study the defect generation in the driven transverse field/anisotropy quantum $XY$ model in the presence of a correlated (colored) Gaussian noise. We propose a generic conjecture that properly capture the noise-induced excitation features, which shows good agreement with the numerical simulations. We show that, the dynamical features of defect density are modified by varying the noise correlation time. Our numerical simulations confirm that, for fast noises, the dynamics of the defect density is the same as that of the uncorrelated (white) noise, as is expected. However, the larger ratio of noise correlation time to the annealing time results in larger defects density formation and reforms the universal dynamical features. Our finding reveals that, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the annealing time for fast noises, while in the presence of the slow noises, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the square of the annealing time. The numerical simulations confirm that, the optimal annealing time, at which the defects density is minimum, scales linearly in logarithmic scale with the total noise power having different exponents for the fast and slow noises.

Title: High-throughput computation and machine learning modeling of magnetic moments and Mössbauer parameters for Fe-based intermetallics
Authors: Bo Zhao, Hongbin Zhang
Abstract: Based on high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we evaluate the local magnetic moments and Mössbauer properties for Fe-based intermetallic compounds and employ machine learning to map the local crystalline environments to such properties. It is observed that magnetic moments and Mössbauer parameters provide complementary insights into the local crystalline environment, where the statistical features cannot be captured using phenomenological models. Furthermore, we find that the scarcity of existing data in Materials Project (MP) poses a significant challenge in developing predictive machine learning models, whereas SOAP-based descriptors can be applied for reliable modeling of the enriched datasets with extra structural prototypes. This work advances the mapping of local crystalline structures to magnetic and spectroscopic properties, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical models.

Title: Driven-dissipative turbulence in exciton-polariton quantum fluids
Authors: R. Ferrini, S.V. Koniakhin
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to comprehensive theoretical studies of exction-polariton quantum fluids specificities in the optics of their utilization for quantum turbulence research. We show that a non-trivial implementation of time-varying potential for excitation of quantum fluid (injection of quantized vortices) via the stirring procedure can be efficiently substituted with resonant excitation-based phase-imprinting techniques. The most efficient phase pattern corresponds to imprinting of tiles with randomly oriented plane waves in each. The resulting turbulent flows, spatial vortex distributions, and clustering statistics resemble those for the case of a conventional spoon-stirring scheme. We quantify the limitations on the lifetime and density depletion for the development and sustainability of quantum turbulence. The yield is the necessity to prevent the density depletion for more than one order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that turbulence is robust with respect to alternating gain and loss at a certain range of modulation parameters, which corresponds to laser operating above and below condensation threshold.

Title: Altermagnetic splitting of magnons in hematite ($α$-Fe$_2$O$_3$)
Authors: Rhea Hoyer, P. Peter Stavropoulos, Aleksandar Razpopov, Roser Valentí, Libor Šmejkal, Alexander Mook
Abstract: We develop a four-sublattice spin-wave theory for the $g$-wave altermagnet candidate hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), considering both its easy-axis phase below and its weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin temperature. A key question is whether the defining altermagnetic feature - magnon spin splitting (also called chirality or polarization splitting) due to nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking - remains intact when relativistic corrections, which contribute to hematite's magnetic order, are included. Using a detailed symmetry analysis supported by density functional theory, we show that capturing the magnon splitting within a Heisenberg model requires exchange interactions extending at least to the 13th neighbor. We find an altermagnetic band splitting of approximately 2 meV, which contrasts with the total band width of about 100 meV. To evaluate the experimental observability of this splitting, we analyze relativistic corrections to the magnon spectrum in both magnetic phases. We show that spin-orbit coupling - manifesting as magnetocrystalline anisotropies and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) - does not obscure the key altermagnetic features. These findings indicate that inelastic neutron scattering can directly probe altermagnetic magnon splitting in hematite. We also discuss implications for magnon transport, particularly magnonic contributions to the thermal Hall effect (which requires spin-orbit coupling) and to spin splitter effects (which do not). Notably, we predict a third-order nonlinear magnon spin splitter effect. This result suggests that the $g$-wave magnon spin splitting in hematite enables transverse heat-to-spin conversion without requiring an external magnetic field.

Title: Solving fractional electron states in twisted MoTe$_2$ with deep neural network
Authors: Di Luo, Timothy Zaklama, Liang Fu
Abstract: The emergence of moiré materials, such as twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), has created a fertile ground for discovering novel quantum phases of matter. However, solving many-electron problems in moiré systems presents significant challenges due to strong electron correlation and strong moiré band mixing. Recent advancements in neural quantum states hold the promise for accurate and unbiased variational solutions. Here, we introduce a powerful neural wavefunction to solve ground states of twisted MoTe2 across various fractional fillings, reaching unprecedented accuracy and system size. From the full structure factor and quantum weight, we conclude that our neural wavefunction accurately captures both the electron crystal at $\nu = 1/3$ and various fractional quantum liquids in a unified manner.

Title: Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered Critical Spin Chain
Authors: Yuxuan Guo, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu
Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.

Title: Quantum geometry and bounds on dissipation in slowly driven quantum systems
Authors: Iliya Esin, Étienne Lantagne-Hurtubise, Frederik Nathan, Gil Refael
Abstract: We show that energy dissipation in slowly-driven, Markovian quantum systems at low temperature is linked to the geometry of the driving protocol through the quantum (or Fubini-Study) metric. Utilizing these findings, we establish lower bounds on dissipation rates in two-tone protocols, such as those employed for topological frequency conversion. Notably, in appropriate limits these bounds are only determined by the topology of the protocol and an effective quality factor of the system-bath coupling. Our results bridge topological and geometric phenomena with energy dissipation in open quantum systems, and further provide design principles for optimal driving protocols.

Title: Critical behavior and multistability in quasi-two-dimensional turbulence
Authors: Filip Novotný, Marek Talíř, Šimon Midlik, Emil Varga
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, despite being an idealization of real flows, is of fundamental interest as a model of the spontaneous emergence of order from chaotic flows. The emergence of order often displays critical behavior, whose study is hindered by the long spatial and temporal scales involved. Here, we experimentally study turbulence in periodically driven nanofluidic channels with a high aspect ratio using superfluid helium. We find a multistable transition behavior resulting from cascading bifurcations of large-scale vorticity and critical behavior at the transition to quasi-2D turbulence consistent with phase transitions in periodically driven many-body systems. We demonstrate that quasi-2D turbulent systems can undergo an abrupt change in response to a small change in a control parameter, consistent with predictions for large-scale atmospheric or oceanic flows.

Title: Reformulation of continuum defects in terms of the general teleparallel geometry in the language of exterior algebra
Authors: Muzaffer Adak, Tekin Dereli, Ertan Kok, Ozcan Sert
Abstract: We discuss the geometric formulation of continuum defects consisting of dislocations and disclinations. After reviewing the metric affine geometry and the present geometric formulation of dislocation and disclination written in terms of torsion and full curvature (together with vanishing non-metricity), we give a new formulation of them in a novel way in terms of torsion and non-metricity (together with vanishing full curvature), the so-called general teleparallel geometry. All calculations are performed by using the exterior algebra. We obtain continuity equations explicitly for dislocation density and disclination density.

Title: Adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulations with compressed circuits and fewer measurements
Authors: Feng Zhang, Cai-Zhuang Wang, Thomas Iadecola, Peter P. Orth, Yong-Xin Yao
Abstract: The adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) method performs real-time evolution of quantum states using automatically generated parameterized quantum circuits that often contain substantially fewer gates than Trotter circuits. Here we report an improved version of the method, which we call AVQDS(T), by porting the Tiling Efficient Trial Circuits with Rotations Implemented Simultaneously (TETRIS) technique. The algorithm adaptively adds layers of disjoint unitary gates to the ansatz circuit so as to keep the McLachlan distance, a measure of the accuracy of the variational dynamics, below a fixed threshold. We perform benchmark noiseless AVQDS(T) simulations of quench dynamics in local spin models demonstrating that the TETRIS technique significantly reduces the circuit depth and two-qubit gate count. We also show a method based on eigenvalue truncation to solve the linear equations of motion for the variational parameters with enhanced noise resilience. Finally, we propose a way to substantially alleviate the measurement overhead of AVQDS(T) while maintaining high accuracy by synergistically integrating quantum circuit calculations on quantum processing units with classical calculations using, e.g., tensor networks to evaluate the quantum geometric tensor. We showcase that this approach enables AVQDS(T) to deliver more accurate results than simulations using a fixed ansatz of comparable final depth for a significant time duration with fewer quantum resources.

Title: A Monte Carlo Tree Search approach to QAOA: finding a needle in the haystack
Authors: Andoni Agirre, Evert Van Nieuwenburg, Matteo M. Wauters
Abstract: The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach QAOA parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.

Title: In-situ tunable interaction with an invertible sign between a fluxonium and a post cavity
Authors: Desislava G. Atanasova, Ian Yang, Teresa Hönigl-Decrinis, Daria Gusenkova, Ioan M. Pop, Gerhard Kirchmair
Abstract: Quantum computation with bosonic modes presents a powerful paradigm for harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to perform complex information processing tasks. In constructing a bosonic qubit with superconducting circuits, nonlinearity is typically introduced to a cavity mode through an ancillary two-level qubit. However, the ancilla's spurious heating has impeded progress towards fully fault-tolerant bosonic qubits. The ability to in situ decouple the ancilla when not in use would be beneficial but has so far only been realized with tunable couplers or additional parametric drives. This work presents a novel architecture for quantum information processing, comprising a 3D post cavity coupled to a fluxonium ancilla via a readout resonator. This system's intricate energy level structure results in a complex landscape of interactions whose sign can be tuned in situ by the magnetic field threading the fluxonium loop without the need of additional elements. Our results could significantly advance the lifetime and controllability of bosonic qubits.

Title: Krylov Complexity in the Schrödinger Field Theory
Authors: Peng-Zhang He, Hai-Qing Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the Krylov complexity of Schrödinger field theories, focusing on both bosonic and fermionic systems within the grand canonical ensemble that includes a chemical potential. Krylov complexity measures operator growth in quantum systems by analyzing how operators spread within the Krylov space, a subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by successive applications of the superoperator $[H,\cdot]$ on an initial operator. Using the Lanczos algorithm, we construct an orthonormal Krylov basis and derive the Lanczos coefficients, which govern the operator connectivity and thus characterize the complexity. Our study reveals that the Lanczos coefficients $\{b_{n}\}$ are independent of the chemical potential, while $\{a_{n}\}$ exhibits a dependence on it. Both $\{a_{n}\}$ and $\{b_{n}\}$ show linear relationships with respect to $n$. For both bosonic and fermionic systems, the Krylov complexities behave similarly over time, especially at late times, due to the analogous profiles of the squared absolute values of their autocorrelation functions $\abs{\varphi_{0}(t)}^{2}$. The Krylov complexity grows exponentially with time, but its asymptotic scaling factor $\lambda_{K}$ is significantly smaller than the twice of the slope of the $\{b_{n}\}$ coefficients, contrasting to the relativistic field theories where the scaling aligns more closely with the twice of the slope of $\{b_{n}\}$.

Title: Fast, accurate, and error-resilient variational quantum noise spectroscopy
Authors: Nanako Shitara, Andrés Montoya-Castillo
Abstract: Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing scalable quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors that operate at molecular scales. Yet, existing methods for such noise spectroscopy face fundamental difficulties, including their reliance on severe approximations and the need for extensively averaged measurements. Here, we propose an alternative approach that processes the commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements using a novel self-consistent optimization framework to extract the noise power spectrum that characterizes the interaction between a qubit or quantum sensor and its environment. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is robust to the presence of measurement errors. We introduce a protocol to quantify confidence intervals and a physically motivated heuristic to determine which new dynamical decoupling measurement can improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that the previous measurements of low-frequency noise had overestimated its strength by an order of magnitude. Our method's noise spectrum reconstructions uncover previously unsuspected structure and offer unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.

Title: Scaling Up Purcell-Enhanced Self-Assembled Nanoplasmonic Perovskite Scintillators into the Bulk Regime
Authors: Michal Makowski, Wenzheng Ye, Dominik Kowal, Francesco Maddalena, Somnath Mahato, Yudhistira Tirtayasri Amrillah, Weronika Zajac, Marcin Eugeniusz Witkowski, Konrad Jacek Drozdowski, Nathaniel, Cuong Dang, Joanna Cybinska, Winicjusz Drozdowski, Ferry Anggoro Ardy Nugroho, Christophe Dujardin, Liang Jie Wong, Muhammad Danang Birowosuto
Abstract: Scintillators, which convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons, play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films due to the localized nature of this effect. In this study, we present a method to extend nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-size plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) fold for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling further predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.63 $\pm$ 0.79) and (5.62 $\pm$ 1.71) fold for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. These findings provide a viable pathway for using nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.

Title: Exceptional stationary state in a dephasing many-body open quantum system
Authors: Alice Marché, Gianluca Morettini, Leonardo Mazza, Lorenzo Gotta, Luca Capizzi
Abstract: We study a dephasing many-body open quantum system that hosts, together with the infinite-temperature state, another additional stationary state. The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.

Title: A trilinear quantum dot architecture for semiconductor spin qubits

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits hold significant potential for scaling to millions of qubits for practical quantum computing applications, as their structure highly resembles the structure of conventional transistors. Since classical semiconductor manufacturing technology has reached an unprecedented level of maturity, reliably mass-producing CMOS chips with hundreds of billions of components, conventional wisdom dictates that leveraging CMOS technologies for quantum dot qubits can result in upscaled quantum processors with thousands or even millions of interconnected qubits. However, the interconnect requirements for quantum circuits are very different from those for classical circuits, where for each qubit individual control and readout wiring could be needed. Although significant developments have been demonstrated on small scale systems, qubit numbers remain limited, to a large extent due to the lack of scalable qubit interconnect schemes. Here, we present a trilinear quantum dot array that is simple in physical layout while allowing individual wiring to each quantum dot. By means of electron shuttling, the trilinear architecture provides qubit connectivity that is equivalent to or even surpasses that of 2D square lattice. Assuming the current qubit fidelities of small-scale devices can be extrapolated to large-scale arrays, medium-length shuttling arrays on the order of tens of microns would allow million-scale qubit systems, while maintaining manageable overheads. We also present a scalable control scheme, where the qubit chip is 3D-integrated with a low-power switch-based cryoCMOS circuit for parallel qubit operation with limited control inputs. As our trilinear quantum dot array is fully compatible with existing semiconductor technologies, this qubit architecture represents one possible framework for future research and development of large-scale spin qubit systems.

Title: Enhancing the Scalability and Applicability of Kohn-Sham Hamiltonians for Molecular Systems
Authors: Yunyang Li, Zaishuo Xia, Lin Huang, Xinran Wei, Han Yang, Sam Harshe, Zun Wang, Chang Liu, Jia Zhang, Bin Shao, Mark B. Gerstein
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a pivotal method within quantum chemistry and materials science, with its core involving the construction and solution of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Despite its importance, the application of DFT is frequently limited by the substantial computational resources required to construct the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In response to these limitations, current research has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and solid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural networks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when applied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of ground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger training set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable model for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce a loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction Alignment Loss (WALoss). WALoss involves performing a basis change on the predicted Hamiltonian to align it with the observed one; thus, the resulting differences can serve as a surrogate for orbital energy differences, allowing models to make better predictions for molecular orbitals and total energies than previously possible. WALoss also substantially accelerates self-consistent-field (SCF) DFT calculations. Here, we show it achieves a reduction in total energy prediction error by a factor of 1347 and an SCF calculation speed-up by a factor of 18%. These substantial improvements set new benchmarks for achieving accurate and applicable predictions in larger molecular systems.

Title: Synaptic Field Theory for Neural Networks
Authors: Donghee Lee, Hye-Sung Lee, Jaeok Yi
Abstract: Theoretical understanding of deep learning remains elusive despite its empirical success. In this study, we propose a novel "synaptic field theory" that describes the training dynamics of synaptic weights and biases in the continuum limit. Unlike previous approaches, our framework treats synaptic weights and biases as fields and interprets their indices as spatial coordinates, with the training data acting as external sources. This perspective offers new insights into the fundamental mechanisms of deep learning and suggests a pathway for leveraging well-established field-theoretic techniques to study neural network training.

Title: The nonlinear limit of Babinet's Principle
Authors: Valentin Dichtl, Thorsten Schumacher, Markus Lippitz
Abstract: Babinet's principle is a powerful tool for predicting the scattering behavior of planar structures where the solution for the complementary structure is already known. This makes it ubiquitous in the design of aperture antennas or metamaterials. Even for plasmonic nanostructures, a qualitative match of the behavior for complementary structures has been reported. Here, we discuss whether Babinet's principle can be extended to nonlinear scattering. We compare the third harmonic emission of plasmonic nanorods and complementary nanoslits by far field imaging and simulation. We find significantly different far field images, in agreement between experiment and simulation. We explain these differences by the higher spatial resolution at the third harmonic wavelength and by additional eddy currents in slits that are not present in rods. Within these limits, Babinet's principle can guide the design of inverted nonlinear plasmonic resonators, which promise to be more stable at high excitation power due to better thermal conductivity.
