Title: Continuously controllable dissipative and coherent couplings by the interaction between anti-resonance and multiple magnons
Authors: Zhenhui Hao, Yuping Yao, Kang An, Xiling Li, Chi Zhang, Guozhi Chai
Abstract: Weexperimentally realize the continuously controllable dissipative coupling and coherent coupling induced by different magnon modes and the same anti-resonance. It has been observed that the weaker the microwave magnetic field distribution of the magnon mode in magnetic materials, the more likely dissipative coupling is to occur. Conversely, stronger magnetic field distributions favor coherent coupling. Based on this principle, we have designed and implemented a system that alternates between dissipative and coherent coupling regimes. It allows microwave signals to be selectively transmitted over a large applied magnetic field range at the frequency of anti-resonance. Our experimental achievements may promote the construction of new magnonics devices like magnetic-tuning switch.

Title: Imaging Topological Defect Dynamics Mediating 2D Skyrmion Lattice Melting
Authors: Raphael Gruber, Jan Rothörl, Simon M. Fröhlich, Maarten A. Brems, Fabian Kammerbauer, Maria-Andromachi Syskaki, Elizabeth M. Jefremovas, Sachin Krishnia, Asle Sudbø, Peter Virnau, Mathias Kläui
Abstract: Topological defects are the key feature mediating 2D phase transitions. However, both resolution and tunability have been lacking to access the dynamics of the transitions. With dynamic Kerr microscopy, we directly capture the melting of a confined 2D magnetic skyrmion lattice with high resolution in real-time and -space. Skyrmions in magnetic thin films are two-dimensional, topologically non-trivial quasi-particles that provide rich dynamics as well as unique tunability as an essential ingredient for controlling phase behavior: We tune the skyrmion size and effective temperature on the fly to drive the two-step melting through an intermediate hexatic regime between the solid lattice and the isotropic liquid. We quantify the characteristic occurrence of topological defects mediating the transitions and reveal the so-far inaccessible dynamics of the lattice dislocations. The full real-time and -space imaging reveals the diffusion coefficient of the dislocations, which we find to be orders of magnitudes higher than that of the skyrmions.

Title: Random Quantum Circuits with Time-Reversal Symmetry
Authors: Kabir Khanna, Abhishek Kumar, Romain Vasseur, Andreas W. W. Ludwig
Abstract: Time-reversal (TR) symmetry is crucial for understanding a wide range of physical phenomena, and plays a key role in constraining fundamental particle interactions and in classifying phases of quantum matter. In this work, we introduce an ensemble of random quantum circuits that are representative of the dynamics of generic TR-invariant many-body quantum systems. We derive a general statistical mechanics model describing entanglement, many-body quantum chaos and quantum information dynamics in such TR-invariant circuits. As an example of application of our formalism, we study the universal properties of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in monitored TR-invariant systems, with measurements performed in a TR-invariant basis. We find that TR-invariance of the unitary part of the dynamics does not affect the universality class, unless measurement outcomes are post-selected to satisfy the global TR-invariance of each quantum trajectory. We confirm these predictions numerically, and find, for both generic and Clifford-based evolutions, novel critical exponents in the case of ``strong'', i.e. global TR-invariance where each quantum trajectory is TR-invariant.

Title: Quantum chaos at finite temperature in local spin Hamiltonians
Authors: Christopher M. Langlett, Cheryne Jonay, Vedika Khemani, Joaquin F. Rodriguez-Nieva
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of chaos in many-body quantum systems away from semi-classical limits, particularly in spatially local interacting spin Hamiltonians, has been a long-standing problem. In these intrinsically quantum regimes, quantum chaos has been primarily understood through the correspondence between the eigensystem statistics of midspectrum eigenstates and the universal statistics described by random matrix theory (RMT). However, this correspondence no longer holds for finite-temperature eigenstates. Here we show that the statistical properties of finite-temperature eigenstates of quantum chaotic Hamiltonians can be accurately described by pure random states constrained by a local charge, with the average charge density of the constrained random state ensemble playing the same role as the average energy density of the eigenstates. By properly normalizing the energy density using a single Hamiltonian-dependent parameter that quantifies the typical energy per degree of freedom, we find excellent agreement between the entanglement entropy statistics of eigenstates and that of constrained random states. Interestingly, in small pockets of Hamiltonian parameter phase space which we previously identified as `maximally chaotic' [PRX 14, 031014 (2024)], we find excellent agreement not only at the level of the first moment, including O(1) corrections, but also at the level of statistical fluctuations. These results show that notions of maximal chaos -- in terms of how much randomness eigenstates contain -- can still be defined at finite temperature in physical Hamiltonian models away from semi-classical and large-$N$ limits.

Title: Landau levels in the mixed state of two-dimensional nodal superconductors: models, featured magneto-optical response and quantized thermal Hall effect
Authors: Zhihai Liu, Bin Wang, Luyang Wang
Abstract: Landau quantization of low-energy quasiparticles (QPs) in the mixed state of gapless superconductors is a celebrated problem. So far, the only superconducting system that has been shown to host Landau levels (LLs) of Bogoliubov QPs is the Weyl superconductor. Here, we first investigate the QPs in the mixed state of two Weyl superconductors, an intrinsic one and a heterostructure one, and reveal that the QP states in the former do not form LLs, in contrast to those in the latter where LLs of QPs are shown to exist. The key is whether the low-energy Hamiltonian respects a generalized chiral symmetry. Following the analysis, we show that a twodimensional superconducting system -- a topological insulator-superconductor heterostructure respecting the generalized chiral symmetry -- exhibits LLs with Chern number $\pm 1$ in the mixed state. We also show featured responses resulting from the LLs, including peaked magneto-optical conductivity and quantized thermal Hall conductivity, which could be used as experimental probes to detect LLs in superconductors.

Title: Coexistence of Kondo Coherence and Localized Magnetic Moments in the Normal State of Molten Salt-Flux Grown UTe2
Authors: N. Azari, M. Yakovlev, S. R. Dunsiger, O. P. Uzoh, E. Mun, B. M. Huddart, S. J. Blundell, M. M. Bordelon, S. M. Thomas, J. D. Thompson, P. F. S. Rosa, J. E. Sonier
Abstract: The development of Kondo lattice coherence in UTe2 leads to the formation of a heavy Fermi liquid state from which superconductivity emerges at lower temperature. In Kondo lattice systems, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and muon Knight shift have proven to be particularly sensitive to the properties of the developing heavy-electron fluid. Here we report muon Knight shift measurements on high-quality UTe2 single crystals grown by a molten salt-flux method. Together with previous data from a single crystal grown by a chemical-vapor transport method, our results show the contribution of the heavy-electron liquid to the muon Knight shift increases below a crossover temperature T* ~ 30 K in accord with a universal scaling function of T/T* for heavy-fermion materials. An observed departure from this universal scaling below a temperature T ~ 12 K at certain muon stopping sites signifies a reversal of the Kondo hybridization and a relocalization of U 5f moments with an antiferromagnetic coupling. The preservation of universal scaling at a different muon site demonstrates a coexistence of itinerant and localized 5f electron states preceding the superconducting phase transition.

Title: Topological constraints on self-organisation in locally interacting systems
Authors: Francesco Sacco, Dalton A R Sakthivadivel, Michael Levin
Abstract: All intelligence is collective intelligence, in the sense that it is made of parts which must align with respect to system-level goals. Understanding the dynamics which facilitate or limit navigation of problem spaces by aligned parts thus impacts many fields ranging across life sciences and engineering. To that end, consider a system on the vertices of a planar graph, with pairwise interactions prescribed by the edges of the graph. Such systems can sometimes exhibit long-range order, distinguishing one phase of macroscopic behaviour from another. In networks of interacting systems we may view spontaneous ordering as a form of self-organisation, modelling neural and basal forms of cognition. Here, we discuss necessary conditions on the topology of the graph for an ordered phase to exist, with an eye towards finding constraints on the ability of a system with local interactions to maintain an ordered target state. By studying the scaling of free energy under the formation of domain walls in three model systems -- the Potts model, autoregressive models, and hierarchical networks -- we show how the combinatorics of interactions on a graph prevent or allow spontaneous ordering. As an application we are able to analyse why multiscale systems like those prevalent in biology are capable of organising into complex patterns, whereas rudimentary language models are challenged by long sequences of outputs.

Title: Duality breaking, mobility edges, and the connection between topological Aubrey-Andr\'e and quantum Hall insulators in atomic wires with fermions
Authors: Bar Alluf, C. A. R. Sa de Melo
Abstract: It is well known that the Aubry-Andr{é} model lacks mobility edges due to its energy-independent self-duality but may exhibit edge states. When duality is broken, we show that mobility regions arise and non-trivial topological phases emerge. By varying the degree of duality breaking, we identify mobility regions and establish a connection between Aubry-Andr{é} atomic wires with fermions and quantum Hall systems for a family of Hamiltonians that depends on the relative phase of laser fields, viewed as a synthetic dimension. Depending on the filling factor and the degree of duality breaking, we find three classes of non-trivial phases: conventional topological insulator, conventional topological Aubry-Andr{é} insulator, and unconventional (hybrid) topological Aubry-Andr{é} insulator. Finally, we discuss appropriate Chern numbers that illustrate the classification of topological phases of localized fermions in atomic wires.

Title: Ground States of the Mean-Field Spin Glass with 3-Spin Couplings
Authors: Stefan Boettcher, Ginger E. Lau (Emory U)
Abstract: We use heuristic optimization methods in extensive computations to determine with low systematic error ground state configurations of the mean-field $p$-spin glass model with $p=3$. Here, all possible triplets in a system of $N$ Ising spins are connected with a bond. This model has been of recent interest, since it exhibits the ``overlap gap condition'', which should make it prohibitive to find ground states asymptotically with local search methods when compared, for instance, with the $p=2$ case better-known as the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model (SK). Indeed, it proves more costly to find good approximations for $p=3$ than for SK, even for our heuristic. Compared to SK, the ground-state behavior for $p=3$ is quite distinct also in other ways. For SK, finite-size corrections for large system sizes $N\to\infty$ of both, the ensemble average over ground state energy densities and the width of their distribution, vary anomalously with non-integer exponents. In the $p=3$ case here, the energy density and its distribution appear to scale with $\ln N/N$ and $1/N$ corrections, respectively. The distribution itself is consistent with a Gumbel form. Even more stark is the contrast for the bond-diluted case, where SK has shown previously a notable variation of the anomalous corrections exponent with the bond density, while for $p=3$ no such variation is found here. Hence, for the 3-spin model, all measured corrections scale the same as for the random energy model (REM), corresponding to $p=\infty$. This would suggest that all $p$-spin models with $p\geq3$ exhibit the same ground-state corrections as in REM.

Title: Accelerating Discovery of Solid-State Thin-Film Metal Dealloying for 3D Nanoarchitecture Materials Design through Laser Thermal Gradient Treatment
Authors: Cheng-Chu Chung, Ruipeng Li, Gabriel M. Veith, Honghu Zhang, Fernando Camino, Ming Lu, Nikhil Tiwale, Sheng Zhang, Kevin Yager, Yu-chen Karen Chen-Wiegart
Abstract: Thin-film solid-state metal dealloying (thin-film SSMD) is a promising method for fabricating nanostructures with controlled morphology and efficiency, offering advantages over conventional bulk materials processing methods for integration into practical applications. Although machine learning (ML) has facilitated the design of dealloying systems, the selection of key thermal treatment parameters for nanostructure formation remains largely unknown and dependent on experimental trial and error. To overcome this challenge, a workflow enabling high-throughput characterization of thermal treatment parameters while probing local nanostructures of thin-film samples is needed. In this work, a laser-based thermal treatment is demonstrated to create temperature gradients on single thin-film samples of Nb-Al/Sc and Nb-Al/Cu. This continuous thermal space enables observation of dealloying transitions and the resulting nanostructures of interest. Through synchrotron X-ray multimodal and high-throughput characterization, critical transitions and nanostructures can be rapidly captured and subsequently verified using electron microscopy. The key temperatures driving chemical reactions and morphological evolutions are clearly identified within this framework. While the oxidation process may contribute to nanostructure formation during thin-film treatment, the dealloying process at the dealloying front involves interactions solely between the dealloying elements, highlighting the availability and viability of the selected systems. This approach enables efficient exploration of the dealloying process and validation of ML predictions, thereby accelerating the discovery of thin-film SSMD systems with targeted nanostructures.

Title: Field induced density wave in a kagome superconductor

Cochran, Yugui Yao, Dragana Popović, Zhiwei Wang, Guoqing Chang, Ronny Thomale, Luis Balicas, M. Zahid Hasan
Abstract: On the kagome lattice, electrons benefit from the simultaneous presence of band topology, flat electronic bands, and van Hove singularities, forming competing or cooperating orders. Understanding the interrelation between these distinct order parameters remains a significant challenge, leaving much of the associated physics unexplored. In the kagome superconductor KV3Sb5, which exhibits a charge density wave (CDW) state below T = 78 K, we uncover an unpredicted field-induced phase transition below 6 K. The observed transition is marked by a hysteretic anomaly in the resistivity, nonlinear electrical transport, and a change in the symmetry of the electronic response as probed via the angular dependence of the magnetoresistivity. These observations surprisingly suggest the emergence of an unanticipated broken symmetry state coexisting with the original CDW. To understand this experimental observation, we developed a theoretical minimal model for the normal state inside the high-temperature parent CDW phase where an incommensurate CDW order emerges as an instability sub-leading to superconductivity. The incommensurate CDW emerges when superconducting fluctuations become fully suppressed by large magnetic fields. Our results suggest that, in kagome superconductors, quantum states can either coexist or are nearly degenerate in energy, indicating that these are rich platforms to expose new correlated phenomena.

Title: Using Principal Component Analysis to Distinguish Different Dynamic Phases in Superconducting Vortex Matter
Authors: C.J.O. Reichhardt, D. McDermott, C. Reichhardt
Abstract: Vortices in type-II superconductors driven over random disorder are known to exhibit a remarkable variety of distinct nonequilibrium dynamical phases that arise due to the competition between vortex-vortex interactions, the quenched disorder, and the drive. These include pinned states, elastic flows, plastic or disordered flows, and dynamically reordered moving crystal or moving smectic states. The plastic flow phases can be particularly difficult to characterize since the flows are strongly disordered. Here we perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the positions and velocities of vortex matter moving over random disorder for different disorder strengths and drives. We find that PCA can distinguish the known dynamic phases as well as or better than previous measures based on transport signatures or topological defect densities. In addition, PCA recognizes distinct plastic flow regimes, a slowly changing channel flow and a moving amorphous fluid flow, that do not produce distinct signatures in the standard measurements. Our results suggest that this position and velocity based PCA approach could be used to characterize dynamic phases in a broader class of systems that exhibit depinning and nonequilibrium phase transitions.

Title: Ferromagnetic Semiconductor Nanotubes with Room Curie Temperatures
Authors: Jia Wen Li, Gang Su, Bo Gu
Abstract: Realizing ferromagnetic semiconductors with room Curie temperature $T\rm_C$ remains a challenge in spintronics. Inspired by the recent experimental progress on the nanotubes based on 2D van der Waals non-magnetic transition-metal dichalcogenides, magnetic nanotubes based on monolayer ferromagnetic materials are highly possible. Here, we proposed a way how to obtain high $T\rm_C$ ferromagnetic semiconductor nanotubes. Some high $T\rm_C$ ferromagnetic semiconductors are predicted in the MX$_2$ nanotubes (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; X = S, Se, Te), including CrS$_2$ and CrTe$_2$ zigzag nanotubes with the diameter of 18 unit cells showing $T\rm_C$ above 300 K. In addition, due to the strain gradient in walls of nanotubes, an electrical polarization at level of $0.1$ eV/Å~inward of the radial direction is obtained. Our results not only present novel ferromagnetic semiconductor nanotubes with room Curie temperature but also be indicative of how to obtain such nanotubes based on experimentally obtained 2D high $T\rm_C$ ferromagnetic metals.

Title: Effects of valley splitting on resonant-tunneling readout of spin qubits
Authors: Tetsufumi Tanamoto, Keiji Ono
Abstract: The effect of valley splitting on the readout of qubit states is theoretically investigated in a three-quantum-dot (QD) system. A single unit of the three-QD system consists of qubit-QDs and a channel-QD that is connected to a conventional transistor. The nonlinear source--drain current characteristics under resonant-tunneling effects are used to distinguish different qubit states. Using nonequilibrium Green functions, the current formula for the three-QD system is derived when each QD has two valley energy levels. Two valley states in each QD are considered to be affected by variations in the fabrication process. We found that when valley splitting is smaller than Zeeman splitting, the current nonlinearity can improve the readout, provided that the nonuniformity of the valley energy levels is small. Conversely, when the valley splitting is larger than the Zeeman splitting, the nonuniformity degraded the readout. In both cases, we showed that there are regions where the measurement time $t_{\rm meas}$ is much less than the decoherence time $t_{\rm dec}$ such that $t_{\rm dec}/t_{\rm meas}>100$. This suggests that less than 1\% measurement error is anticipated, which opens up the possibility for implementing surface codes even in the presence of valley splitting.

Title: Stability of the long-range corrected exchange-correlation functional in time-dependent density-functional theory
Authors: Jared R. Williams, Carsten A. Ullrich
Abstract: Excitonic effects in the optical absorption spectra of solids can be described with time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) in the linear-response regime, using a simple class of approximate, long-range corrected (LRC) exchange-correlation functionals. It was recently demonstrated that the LRC approximation can also be employed in real-time TDDFT to describe exciton dynamics. Here, we investigate the numerical stability of the time-dependent LRC approach using a two-dimensional model solid. It is found that the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation with an LRC vector potential becomes more and more prone to instabilities for increasing exciton binding energies. The origin of these instabilities is traced back to time-averaged violations of the zero-force theorem, which leads to a simple and robust numerical stabilization scheme. This explains and justifies a recently proposed method by Dewhurst et al., arXiv:2401.16140.

Title: Observation of molecular and polymeric nitrogen stuffed NaCl ionic layers
Authors: Ping Ning, Yifan Tian, Guangtao Liu, Hongbo Wang, Qingyang Hu, Hanyu Liu, Mi Zhou, Yanming Ma
Abstract: Sodium chloride (NaCl), a ubiquitous and chemically stable compound, has been considered inert under ambient conditions. Its typical B1 structure is highly isotropic without preferential direction, favoring the growth of a three-dimensional network of strong Na-Cl ionic bonds. Here, we employ first-principles structural searching and synchrotron X-ray diffraction to unravel an unexpected chemical reaction between NaCl and N2 to produce a hybrid salt-NaCl(N2)2, where N2 molecules break the isotropic NaCl structure into two-dimensional layers upon synthesis at 50 GPa. In contrast to the insulating properties of pristine NaCl, the electronic bandgap of the N2-stuffed NaCl narrowed to 1.8 eV, becoming an indirect bandgap semiconductor. Further compression to 130 GPa induced the polymerization of N atoms into zigzag N-chains. Our findings not only demonstrate the possibility of unusual N-chemistry under extreme conditions, but also suggest a feasible approach for the design of layered NaCl frameworks to modulate the polymerization of nitrogen.

Title: Spontaneous Donor Defects and Voltage-Assisted Hole Doping in Beta-Gallium Oxides under Multiple Epitaxy Conditions
Authors: Chenxi Nie, Kai Liu, Chengxuan Ke, Xisong Jiang, Yifeng He, Yonghong Deng, Yanhua Yan, Guangfu Luo
Abstract: Beta-phase gallium oxide (beta-Ga2O3) is prone to the spontaneous formation of donor defects but poses a formidable challenge in achieving high-quality p-type doping, mainly due to its exceptionally low valence band maximum (VBM). In this study, we utilize first-principles computations to investigate the origin of spontaneous donor defects in beta-Ga2O3 grown by three typical techniques: molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), and halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE). Our findings elucidate that the primary donor defects vary with the growth techniques, specifically Gai3+ for MBE, Hi+ and CGa+ for MOCVD, and (2VGa+Gai+2VO)+ and ClO+ for HVPE under unintentionally doped conditions. Employing a theoretically proposed voltage-assisted doping method, we computationally demonstrate that the dominant spontaneous donors can be significantly reduced accompanied by a noticeable increase in acceptors, leading to a stepwise reduction of Fermi level to 0.52, 0.88, and 2.10 eV above VBM for the MOCVD, HVPE, and MBE methods, and a hole concentration of 8.5*10^17, 8.7*10^11, and 2.7*10^-9 cm-3, respectively, at room temperature without the use of external dopants. By introducing Mg doping, we further reduce the Fermi level for both the MBE and HVPE experiments.

Title: Model for the commensurate charge-density waves in under-hole-doped cuprate superconductors
Authors: Jacob Morrissey, Timothy J.Haugan, Richard A. Klemm
Abstract: A simple model of the commensurate charge-density wave (CCDW) portion of the underdoped pseudogap regions of monolayer Bi$_2$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$CuO$_{6-x}$ (Bi2201), bilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi2212), and trilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ (Bi2223) cuprate superconductors is presented and studied. Above the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ but below the pseudogap transition temperature $T_p > T_c$, the CCDW forms on the oxygen sites in the CuO$_2$ layers with excess charges of $\pm\delta e$, where $e$ is the electronic charge, forming on alternating oxygen sites. This model is equivalent to $N$-layer versions of the two-dimensional Ising model for spins on a square lattice with repulsive interactions $J' , J>0$ between near-neighbor inter- and intralayer sites, respectively. For strong coupling, we show analytically for sections of $L\times M\times N$ sites that the partition function in the $J'\rightarrow\pm \infty$ limits reduces to that for an effective single layer with $L\times M$ sites and $J$ replaced by $NJ$. The CCDW is therefore strongly enhanced and stabilized by multilayer structures, likely accounting for the enhanced THz emission observed from the intrinsic Josephson junctions in underdoped Bi2212 mesas and for the many experiments on Bi2212 and related compounds purporting to provide evidence for a superconducting order parameter with $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry.

Title: Probing scattering of Raman phonons on magnetic and electronic excitations in pyrochlores Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Sami Muhammad, Yuanyuan Xu, Christos Kakogiannis, Takumi Ohtsuki, Yang Qiu, Satoru Nakatsuji, Eli Zoghlin, Stephen D. Wilson, Natalia Drichko
Abstract: Magnetic rare earth atoms on pyrochlore lattice can produce such exotic magnetic states as spin ice and quantum spin ice. These states are a result of the frustration in the pyrochlore lattice, as well as crystal field degrees of freedom of rare earth atoms, and their interactions with the lattice. Raman scattering spectroscopy, which possess high spectral resolution and can easily access broad energy and temperature ranges, is an optimum tool to study these excitations and their interactions. In this work we follow Raman scattering of zone center phonons and crystal field excitations of Nd$^{3+}$ in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ in the temperature range where these materials are paramagnetic. A comparison between an insulating Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and semimetallic Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ materials allow us to distinguish between scattering of phonons on other phonons, crystal field excitations, and electrons, highlighting interactions between these degrees of freedom.

Title: Stabilizing Single-Atom Catalysts on Metastable Phases of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Lina Wang, Zhenhai Wen, Guangfu Luo
Abstract: Single-atom catalysts have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional atomic utilization and high efficiency in a range of catalytic reactions. However, these systems often face thermodynamic instability, leading to agglomeration under operational conditions. In this study, we investigate the interactions of twelve types of catalytic atoms (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, Au, and Bi) on three crystalline phases (1T, 1T', and 2H) of six transition metal dichalcogenide layers (MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2, and WTe2) based on first-principles calculations. We ultimately identify 82 stable single-atom systems that thermodynamically prevent the formation of metal clusters on these substrates. Notably, our findings reveal that the metastable 1T and 1T' phases significantly enhance the binding strength with single atoms and promote their thermodynamic stability. This research offers valuable insights into the design of stable single-atom systems and paves the way for discovering innovative catalysts in the future.

Title: Single crystal growth of 1T-VSe$_2$ by molten salt flux method
Authors: Muhammed Anees K T, Souvik Kumar Rana, Abinash Das, Moumita Nandi
Abstract: VSe$_2$ is a highly promising van der Waals (vdW) material for applications in electronics, spintronics, and optoelectronics. Here, we report single crystal growth of 1T-VSe$_2$ by flux method using eutectic of NaCl/KCl molten salt. The typical size of as-grown VSe$_2$ single crystals is 5 $\times$ 4 $\times$ 0.1~mm$^3$. The elemental composition and homogeneity of the crystals were examined by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, which is consistent with the stoichiometric ratio of VSe$_2$. The crystallographic [001] direction has been determined by x-ray diffraction. Raman measurement confirms that the 1T phase of VSe$_2$ has been formed. Temperature-dependent resistivity measurement exhibits a transition around 104 K due to the formation of the charge density wave phase.

Title: Liquid water transport model in hydrophilic granular : Preliminary validation with drying rate of hierarchical granular
Authors: Hyuga Yasuda, Hiroaki Katsuragi, Makoto Katsura
Abstract: The drying rate profile of granular beds can be divided into the constant rate period (CRP), which is characterized by a nearly constant drying rate, and the falling rate period (FRP), in which the drying rate rapidly decays. In order to explain this behavior quantitatively, we proposed a simple one-dimensional power law model in which the product of the water permeability and the pressure gradient is assumed to be proportional to the cube of the saturation. To test this model, we measured the drying rates of glass beads and hierarchical granular materials produced by sintering and breaking glass beads. Our results and those of previous experiments showed consistency with the power law. The obtained proportional constant of the experimental power law also shows a rough agreement with that estimated from previous studies on water permeability and capillary pressure. Drying behavior in FRP also agrees with our model in some points. The remnant deviation of the model from experimental results may be attributed to the inhomogeneity of granular media, which was qualitatively verified.

Title: Read out the fermion parity of a potential artificial Kitaev chain utilizing a transmon qubit

Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains have emerged as a promising platform for realizing topological quantum computing. Once the chains are formed and the Majorana zero modes are braided/fused, reading out the parity of the chains is essential for further verifying the non-Abelian property of the Majorana zero modes. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using a superconducting transmon qubit, which incorporates an end of a four-site quantum dot-superconductor chain based on a Ge/Si nanowire, to directly detect the singlet/doublet state, and thus the parity of the entire chain. We also demonstrate that for multiple-dot chains there are two types of 0-{\pi} transitions between different charging states: the parity-flip 0-{\pi} transition and the parity-preserved 0-{\pi} transition. Furthermore, we show that the inter-dot coupling, hence the strengths of cross Andreev reflection and elastic cotunneling of electrons, can be adjusted by local electrostatic gating in chains fabricated on Ge/Si core-shell nanowires. Our exploration would be helpful for the ultimate realization of topological quantum computing based on artificial Kitaev chains.

Title: Liquid Metal-Exfoliated SnO$_2$-Based Mixed-dimensional Heterostructures for Visible-to-Near-Infrared Photodetection

Abstract: Ultra-thin two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained significant attention for making next-generation optoelectronic devices. Here, we report a large-area heterojunction photodetector fabricated using a liquid metal-printed 2D $\text{SnO}_2$ layer transferred onto CdTe thin films. The resulting device demonstrates efficient broadband light sensing from visible to near-infrared wavelengths, with enhanced detectivity and faster photo response than bare CdTe photodetectors. Significantly, the device shows a nearly $10^5$-fold increase in current than the dark current level when illuminated with a 780 nm laser and achieves a specific detectivity of around $10^{12} \, \text{Jones}$, nearly two orders of magnitude higher than a device with pure CdTe thin film. Additionally, temperature-dependent optoelectronic testing shows that the device maintains a stable response up to $140^\circ \text{C}$ and generates distinctive photocurrent at temperatures up to $80^\circ \text{C}$, demonstrating its thermal stability. Using band structure analysis, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and photocurrent mapping, the formation of a $p$-$n$ junction is indicated, contributing to the enhanced photo response attributed to the efficient carrier separation by the built-in potential in the hetero-junction and the superior electron mobility of 2D $\text{SnO}_2$. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating liquid metal-exfoliated 2D materials for enhanced photodetector performance.

Title: Geometry-Driven Mechanical Memory in a Random Fibrous Matrix
Authors: Mainak Sarkar, Christina Laukaitis, Amy Wagoner Johnson
Abstract: Disordered fibrous matrices, formed by the random assembly of fibers, provide the structural framework for many biological systems and biomaterials. Applied deformation modifies the alignment and stress states of constituent fibers, tuning the nonlinear elastic response of these materials. While it is generally presumed that fibers return to their original configurations after deformation is released, except when neighboring fibers coalesce or individual fibers yield, this reversal process remains largely unexplored. The intricate geometry of these matrices leaves an incomplete understanding of whether releasing deformation fully restores the matrix or introduces new microstructural deformation mechanisms. To address this gap, we investigated the evolution of matrix microstructures during the release of an applied deformation. Numerical simulations were performed on quasi-two-dimensional matrices of random fibers under localized tension, with fibers modeled as beams in finite element analysis. After tension release, the matrix exhibited permanent mechanical remodeling, with greater remodeling occurring at higher magnitudes of applied tension, indicative of the matrix preserving its loading history as mechanical memory. This response was surprising; it occurred despite the absence of explicit plasticity mechanisms, such as activation of inter-fiber cohesion or fiber yielding. We attributed the observed remodeling to the gradient in fiber alignment that developed within the matrix microstructure under applied tension, driving the subsequent changes in matrix properties during the release of applied tension. Therefore, random fibrous matrices tend to retain mechanical memory due to their intricate geometry.

Title: Compaction of Granular Columns under Thermal Cycling
Authors: Yuxuan Luo, Haiyang Lu, Xinyu Ai, Zelin Liu, Houfei Yuan, Zhuan Ge, Zhikun Zeng, Yujie Wang
Abstract: Granular materials undergo compaction under periodic temperature fluctuations, leading to various engineering and geological phenomena from landslides to silo compaction. Although thermal effects on granular materials have been extensively studied in soil mechanics and geology, the underlying physical mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the compaction dynamics of granular materials subjected to thermal cycling using monodisperse glass beads and polydisperse sand packings. We demonstrate that differential thermal expansion between the container and the grains drives compaction through shear in our experimental systems. We quantify compaction dynamics using three established fitting models: Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW), double-exponential, and logarithmic functions. Our results reveal that granular materials exhibit slow relaxation processes in response to weak perturbations, displaying aging dynamics similar to those observed in glassy systems. These findings provide insights into fundamental mechanisms of granular compaction with broad implications for geological and engineering applications.

Title: Line Edge Roughness Effects on the Thermoelectric Properties of Armchair Black Phosphorene Nanoribbons
Authors: Ebrahim Pishevar, Hossein Karamitaheri
Abstract: This study delves into the thermoelectric properties of armchair black phosphorene nanoribbons while considering the presence of line edge roughness. Employing the tight-binding method in conjunction with non-equilibrium Green's function techniques and Landauer formulas, we explore the impact of various parameters on thermoelectric performance. Our findings reveal that the electrical conductivity and, consequently, the power factor exhibit an increasing trend with expanding ribbon length and width. This behavior can be attributed to heightened collision rates, particularly in narrow ribbons, induced by line edge roughness as length increases. Remarkably, the Seebeck coefficient at the Fermi energy corresponding to the maximum power factor remains nearly constant across different widths, lengths, temperatures and transport regimes. Furthermore, the thermoelectric figure of merit demonstrates a positive correlation with both ribbon length and width. In narrow widths and lengths around 1000 nm, the power factor and figure of merit exhibit an upward trend with ribbon width. However, with further increases in ribbon width, the influence of line edge roughness on thermal conductivity diminishes. Consequently, the figure of merit decreases due to the rise in thermal conductivity. Notably, the thermoelectric figure of merit is higher for short and narrow ribbons and long and wider ribbons.

Title: Structural and optical changes induced by incorporation of antimony into InAs/GaAs(001) quantum dots
Authors: A. G. Taboada, A. M. Sánchez, A. M. Beltrán, M. Bozkurt, D. Alonso-Álvarez, B. Alén, A. Rivera, J. M. Ripalda, J. M. Llorens, J. Martín-Sánchez, Y. González, J. M. Ulloa, J. M. García, S. I. Molina, P. M. Koenraad
Abstract: We present experimental evidence of Sb incorporation inside InAs/GaA(001) quantum dots exposed to an antimony flux immediately before capping with GaAs. The Sb composition profile inside the nanostructures as measured by cross-sectional scanning tunneling and electron transmission microscopies show two differentiated regions within the quantum dots, with an Sb rich alloy at the tip of the quantum dots. Atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy micrographs show increased quantum-dot height with Sb flux exposure. The evolution of the reflection high-energy electron-diffraction pattern suggests that the increased height is due to changes in the quantum-dot capping process related to the presence of segregated Sb atoms. These structural and compositional changes result in a shift of the room-temperature photoluminescence emission from 1.26 to 1.36 microns accompanied by an order of magnitude increase in the room-temperature quantum-dot luminescence intensity.

Title: New process for high optical quality InAs quantum dots grown on patterned GaAs(001) substrates
Authors: Pablo Alonso-Gonzalez, Luisa González, Yolanda González, David Fuster, Iván FernándezMartínez, Javier Martín-Sanchez, Leon Abelmann
Abstract: This work presents a selective ultraviolet (UV)-ozone oxidation-chemical etching process that has been used, in combination with laser interference lithography (LIL), for the preparation of GaAs patterned substrates. Further molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of InAs results in ordered InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) arrays with high optical quality from the first layer of QDs formed on the patterned substrate. The main result is the development of a patterning technology that allows the engineering of customized geometrical displays of QDs with the same optical quality as those formed spontaneously on flat non-patterned substrates.

Title: Ordered InAs QDs using prepatterned substrates by monolithically integrated porous alumina
Authors: Pablo Alonso-González, María S. Martín-González, Javier Martín-Sánchez, Yolanda González, Luisa González
Abstract: In this work, we explore a method for obtaining site-controlled InAs quantum dots (QDs) on large areas of GaAs (0 0 1) pre-patterned surface. The patterning of the substrate is obtained by using a monolithically integrated nano-channel alumina (NCA) mask and transferring its self-ordering to the underlying GaAs substrate by continuing the anodization process once the GaAs surface is reached. After patterning, the GaAs substrate follows a low temperature process for surface preparation before epitaxial growth for QD formation. As a final result, we observe that the nanoholes act as preferential nucleation sites for InAs QD formation, with a filling factor close to unity, while the QD formation on the surface region between the pattern holes is completely suppressed.

Title: Suppression of ferromagnetism in van der Waals insulator due to pressure-induced layer stacking variation
Authors: M. Misek, U. Dutta, P. Kral, D. Hovancik, J. Kastil, K. Pokhrel, S. Ray, J. Valenta, J. Prchal, J. Kamarad, F. Borodavka, V. Eigner, M. Dusek, V. Holy, K. Carva, S. Kamba, V. Sechovsky, J. Pospisil
Abstract: External pressure suppresses the ferromagnetism of localized Cr 3d electron moments in the van der Waals insulator CrBr3, which cannot be explained without considering a dramatic pressure-induced crystal or electronic structure change. We addressed this issue by conducting a parallel experimental investigation of single crystals magnetic and structural properties using magnetization, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy measurements. Ab initio DFT calculations of electronic structure and atomistic simulations of finite-temperature magnetism supported the analysis and interpretation of experimental results. The magnetization measurements at high pressures provided the first direct experimental evidence of the pressure-induced suppression of ferromagnetism. We observed a gradual decrease of the bulk magnetic moment and Curie temperature with increasing pressure, which accelerates at pressures above 3 GPa, leading to loss of ferromagnetism at 6.5 GPa. By increasing pressure, the ambient pressure phase gradually breaks down and is accompanied by the generation of layer stacking that favor the antiferromagnetic coupling of Cr moments. As a result, the appearing antiparallel pairs of moments disturb the ferromagnetic structure and reduce the bulk magnetic moment and Curie temperature. This scenario, which is well corroborated by the results of our theoretical calculations, suggests an antiferromagnetic phase emerging with increasing pressure beyond the critical value when the new single trigonal P-3m1 phase becomes stable, characterized by the "antiferromagnetic" A-A layer stacking, becomes stable. The weak coupling between adjacent magnetic layers in van der Waals materials allows variations in layering due to sufficient external forces. We hope our comprehensive study's results can help other researchers resolve frequently appearing issues of similar origin in this class of materials.

Title: Critical evaluations of different implementations of Edwards volume ensemble
Authors: Houfei Yuan, Yujie Wang
Abstract: Granular systems can display reproducible microscopic distributions governed by a few macroscopic parameters, parallel to equilibrium statistical mechanics. Building on this analogy, Edwards' s pioneering framework proposes a volume ensemble of equiprobable jammed states, introducing compactivity chi as an effective temperature. Despite its promise, debates persist regarding the framework' s formulation and validity, with practical implementation often exposing inconsistencies. This study systematically examines different implementations using experimental data from spherical particle packings with varying friction coefficients, subjected to tapping and shearing. Our findings show that the heat capacity and overlapping histogram methods yield consistent Chi values. Discrepancies in other approaches, such as the free volume model, primarily stem from differing reference-state compactivities and microstate definitions, whereas the mean-field theory, which effectively accounts for mechanical stability within a geometric coordination-number phase space, is constrained by its isostatic assumption and inherent approximations. Additionally, an effective temperature Chi_f defined on Delaunay tetrahedra better describes topological excitations, but represents a quasi-equilibrium state, with true equilibrium achieved only under Chi. This study refines and expands our understanding of the Edwards volume ensemble in line with Edwards' s original ideas, highlighting the combined contributions of friction and inherently disordered packing structures.

Title: An Alternative Model For Topologically-Stable Magnetic Skyrmions
Authors: Emir Syahreza Fadhilla, M Shoufie Ukhtary, Ardian Nata Atmaja, Bobby Eka Gunara
Abstract: One of the main quantities which describe the topological properties of magnetic Skyrmion is the Skyrmion number density, $q$. In this work, we study an alternative model of a two-dimensional magnetic system where the dynamics of the spins explicitly depend on $q$ and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is omitted. The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert dynamics is employed for the micromagnetic calculations and it is found that one of the possible static lowest energy configurations of the proposed model is a Skyrmion with a topological charge equal to one. This lowest energy configuration is stable under small linear perturbation and it is shown that the total energy of the system is bounded from below such that it is always higher than the vacuum energy, implying a topologically protected configuration. The alternative model is an effective model for Skyrmions in two-dimensional systems. We also propose that this model can be used for magnetic systems under a strong external magnetic field where the ordinary exchange interactions are much weaker than the Zeeman effect.

Title: Two-dimensional multiferroic NbPc COF with strong magnetoelectric coupling and room-temperature ferroelectricity
Authors: Wei Li, Dongyang Zhu, Shuai Dong, Jun-Jie Zhang
Abstract: The realization of two-dimensional multiferroics offers significant potential for nanoscale device functionality. However, type-I two-dimensional multiferroics with strong magnetoelectric coupling, enabling electric field control of spin, remain scarce. In this study, using density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations, we predict that the niobium phthalocyanine covalent organic framework (NbPc COF) monolayer exhibits type-I multiferroic behavior, with a ferroelectric transition occurring above room temperature. Remarkably, the strong magnetoelectric coupling in NbPc COF monolayer arises from the same origin of magnetism and ferroelectricity. Our findings offer flexible pathways for the design and development of organic nanoscale multiferroic devices with broad applications.

Title: Enhanced and Efficient Extraction of Uranyl Ions from Aqueous Waste through Graphene/CNT-PAMAM Nanocomposites
Authors: Tarun Maity, Yogendra Kumar, Ashish Kumar Singha Deb, Sk Musharaf Ali, Prabal K Maiti
Abstract: The increasing threat of uranium contamination to environmental and human health due to its radiotoxicity demands the development of novel and efficient adsorbents for remediation. In this study, we investigated the potential of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers of generations 1 to 4 (G1 - G4) functionalized with graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as adsorbents for uranyl ion removal from aqueous solutions. By combining atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with experimental validation, we examined the influence of pH, uranyl ion concentration, and dendrimer generation on adsorption behavior. Our study revealed that uranyl ion adsorption is greater when PAMAM is grafted onto graphene/CNT than pristine PAMAM. However, PAMAM-grafted CNTs exhibit superior adsorption capacity at specific uranyl concentrations due to their curvature and abundant accessible binding sites. Higher-generation PAMAM dendrimers grafted onto graphene/CNTs exhibit greater adsorption capacity due to the increased availability of binding sites, which is consistent with experimental observations. The adsorption capability of uranyl ions in all four generations of the PAMAM dendrimer increased as the concentration of uranyl ions increased. Adsorption capacity increases with increasing uranyl ion concentration, and adsorption occurs on both PAMAM and graphene/CNT surfaces, with saturation observed at higher concentrations. This study provides insights into the adsorption mechanisms and highlights the potential of PAMAM-based nanocomposites for efficient uranyl ion extraction and environmental remediation.

Title: Observation of Higher-order Topological Bound States in the Continuum using Ultracold Atoms
Authors: Zhaoli Dong, Hang Li, Hongru Wang, Yichen Pan, Wei Yi, Bo Yan
Abstract: Simulating higher-order topological materials in synthetic quantum matter is an active research frontier for its theoretical significance in fundamental physics and promising applications in quantum technologies. Here we experimentally implement two-dimensional (2D) momentum lattices with highly programmable ability using ultracold 87Rb atoms. Through precise control of experimental parameters, we simulate a 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with this technique, and observe the characteristic dynamics of corner and edge-bound states, where the corner state is identified as a higher-order topological bound state in the continuum. We further study the adiabatic preparation of the corner state by engineering evolutions with time-dependent Hamiltonians. We also demonstrate the higher-order topological phase transition by measuring both the bulk topological invariant and the topological corner state. Our new platform opens the avenue for exploring the exotic dynamics and topology in higher synthetic dimensions, making use of the rich degrees of freedom of cold atoms systems.

Title: Medium Temperature Phase Change Materials Thermal Characterization by the T-History Method and Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Authors: D. Gaona, E. Urresta, J. Martinez, G. Guerron
Abstract: This paper presents a thermal characterization of salt mixtures applying the T-History Method and the Differential Scanning Calorimetry DSC techniques. By using water as a standard substance, the original T-History method was developed to analyze materials with melting points under 100 Celsius. This is the first research that proposes to replace water by glycerin to characterize medium melting temperature PCMs from 140 to 220 Celsius. Moreover, the DSC technique was used to validate and compare the results obtained with the T-history method for each mixture. For instance, the system compound of 40 KNO$_3$ to 60 NaNO$_3$ was studied, and the enthalpy of fusion determined by THM and DSC differs by 2.1% between each method. The results given by the two methods for all mixtures showed that both techniques are complementary and present satisfactory agreement with the specialized literature.

Title: Signature of superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10-x single crystals grown at ambient pressure
Authors: Feiyu Li, Yinqiao Hao, Ning Guo, Jian Zhang, Qiang Zheng, Guangtao Liu, Junjie Zhang
Abstract: Nickelates have attracted enormous attention since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 under high pressure. However, whether superconducting nickelate single crystals can be prepared at ambient pressure remains elusive. Here we report signature of superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10-x single crystals grown from potassium carbonate flux at ambient pressure. Single crystal X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy investigations re-vealed high-quality single crystals with perfect stacking of trilayers. Resistivity measurements indicate that the metal-to-metal transition observed at ambient pressure was suppressed under high pressure, and a sharp drop occurred at ~30 K at 77.9 GPa, consistent with superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10 single crystals grown by the floating zone method at an oxygen pressure of >18 bar. Our results not only provide an important path to prepare high-quality nickelate single crystals but also support superconductivity in nickelates under high pressure, promoting more systematic and in-depth research in this compelling field.

Title: Anisotropic suppression of the phononic thermal conductivity by magnetic field in SmAlSi
Authors: Mujeeb Ahmad, Md Shahin Alam, Xiaohan Yao, Fazel Tafti, Marcin Matusiak
Abstract: We report the thermal and electrical conductivity data for the magnetic Weyl semimetal SmAlSi measured in a magnetic field (B) with two different orientations. In one case, B was applied perpendicular to the heat or charge current, in the other they were parallel. For both configurations, the magnetic field affects the magnetic structure identically as B is always parallel to the equivalent tetragonal axis. Our results indicate that phonon heat transport in response to the magnetic field exhibits strong anisotropy at low temperature: it appears to be independent of B in the perpendicular configuration but is strongly suppressed in the parallel configuration. Understanding this unusual behaviour can lead to designing better materials for thermoelectricity or directional heat switches.

Title: Highly Uniform Magnetic and Electronic Environment in Non-Centrosymmetric Superconductor LaRhGe$_3$
Authors: Shunsaku Kitagawa, Hiroyasu Matsudaira, Kenji Ishida, Mohamed Oudah
Abstract: We report the results of $^{139}$La NMR measurements in the non-centrosymmetric superconductor LaRhGe$_3$. This material crystallizes in a tetragonal structure without inversion symmetry and exhibits type-I superconductivity below 385 mK. We observed remarkably sharp NMR signals, indicating that the magnetic and electronic properties of the sample are extremely uniform in LaRhGe$_3$ despite the complex crystal structure. Our NMR results indicate that LaRhGe$_3$ is a weakly correlated semimetal in the normal state.

Title: Giant end-tunneling effect in two distinct Luttinger liquids coexisting in one quantum wire

Abstract: Luttinger liquids occupy a special place in physics as the most understood case of essentially quantum many-body systems. The experimental mission of measuring its main prediction, power laws in observable quantities, has already produced a body of exponents in different semiconductor and metallic structures. Here, we combine tunneling spectroscopy with density-dependent transport measurements in the same quantum wires over more than two orders of magnitude in temperature to very low temperatures down to $\sim$40 mK. This reveals that, when the second 1D subband becomes populated, the temperature dependence splits into two ranges with different exponents in the power-law dependence of the conductance, both dominated by the finite-size effect of the end-tunneling process. This result demonstrates the importance of measuring the Luttinger parameters as well as the number of modes independently through spectroscopy in addition to the transport exponent in the characterization of Luttinger liquids. This opens a new pathway to unambiguous interpretation of the exponents observed in quantum wires.

Title: Mode-Shell correspondence, a unifying phase space theory in topological physics -- part II: Higher-dimensional spectral invariants
Authors: Lucien Jezequel, Pierre Delplace
Abstract: The mode-shell correspondence relates the number $I_M$ of gapless modes in phase space to a topological \textit{shell invariant} $\Ish$ defined on a close surface -- the shell -- surrounding those modes, namely $I_M=I_S$. In part I, we introduced the mode-shell correspondence for zero-modes of chiral symmetric Hamiltonians (class AIII). In this part II, we extend the correspondence to arbitrary dimension and to both symmetry classes A and AIII. This allows us to include, in particular, $1D$-unidirectional edge modes of Chern insulators, massless $2D$-Dirac and $3D$-Weyl cones, within the same formalism. We provide an expression of $I_M$ that only depends on the dimension of the dispersion relation of the gapless mode, and does not require a translation invariance. Then, we show that the topology of the shell (a circle, a sphere, a torus), that must account for the spreading of the gapless mode in phase space, yields specific expressions of the shell index. Semi-classical expressions of those shell indices are also derived and reduce to either Chern or winding numbers depending on the parity of the mode's dimension. In that way, the mode-shell correspondence provides a unified and systematic topological description of both bulk and boundary gapless modes in any dimension, and in particular includes the bulk-boundary correspondence. We illustrate the generality of the theory by analyzing several models of semimetals and insulators, both on lattices and in the continuum, and also discuss weak and higher-order topological phases within this framework. Although this paper is a continuation of Part I, the content remains sufficiently independent to be mostly read separately.

Title: Emergent spin Hall conductivity in Tantalum-Rhenium alloys
Authors: Felix Janus, Jyoti Yadav, Nicolas Beermann, Wentao Zhang, Hassan A. Hafez, Dmitry Turchinovich, Sascha Preu, Markus Meinert
Abstract: We investigate the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) of a composition series of a Ta-Re bcc solid solution. At approximately 60 at.% Ta the Ta-Re alloy features an SHC similar to bcc-W, while both endpoints of the compositional series have rather moderate SHC. The intermediate stoichiometries exhibit a substantial enhancement due to Fermi level tuning through the same band structure feature which gives bcc-W and $\beta$-W its large SHC. We provide experimental evidence for the enhancement of the SHC in the alloy via THz emission upon ultrafast laser excitation of Ta-Re/CoFeB bilayers. We demonstrate that a rigid band model derived from bcc-W and Fermi level tuning describes the experimental data with a similar accuracy as coherent potential approximation alloy calculations of the SHC.

Title: Spin-polarized STM measurement scheme for quantum geometric tensor
Authors: Shu-Hui Zhang, Jin Yang, Ding-Fu Shao, Jia-Ji Zhu, Wen-Long You, Wen Yang, Kai Chang
Abstract: Quantum geometric tensor (QGT) reflects the geometry of the eigenstates of a system's Hamiltonian. The full characterization of QGT is essential for various quantum systems. However, it is challenging to characterize the QGT of the solid-state systems. Here we present a scheme by using spin-polarized STM to measure QGT of two-dimensional solid-state systems, in which the spin texture is extracted from geometric amplitudes of Friedel oscillations induced by the intentionally introduced magnetic impurity and then the QGT is derived from the momentum differential of spin texture. The surface states of topological insulator (TISS), as a model spin system, is promising to demonstrate the scheme. In a TI slab, the gapped TISS host finite quantum metric and Berry curvature as the symmetric real part and the antisymmetric imaginary part of QGT, respectively. Thus, a detailed calculations guide the use of the developed scheme to measure the QGT of gapped TISS with or without an external in-plane magnetic field. This study provides a feasible scheme for measuring QGT of two-dimensional solid-state systems, and hints at the great potential of the information extraction from the geometric amplitudes of STM and other measurement.

Title: Experimental Realizations of Information Engines: Beyond Proof of Concept
Authors: Rémi Goerlich, Laura Hoek, Omer Chor, Saar Rahav, Yael Roichman
Abstract: Gathering information about a system enables greater control over it. This principle lies at the core of information engines, which use measurement-based feedback to rectify thermal noise and convert information into work. Originating from Maxwell's and Szilárd's thought experiments, the thermodynamics of information engines has steadily advanced, with recent experimental realizations both confirming established results and pushing the field forward. Coupled with technological advances and developments in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, novel implementations of information engines continue to challenge theoretical understanding. In this perspective, we discuss recent progress and highlight new opportunities, such as applying information engines to active, many-body, and inertial systems, and leveraging tools like optimal control to design their driving protocols.

Title: Room temperature observation of the anomalous in-plane Hall effect in epitaxial thin films of a Weyl ferromagnet
Authors: Soumya Sankar, Xingkai Cheng, Tahir Murtaza, Caiyun Chen, Yuqi Qin, Xuezhao Wu, Qiming Shao, Rolf Lortz, Junwei Liu, Berthold Jäck
Abstract: Topologically nontrivial electronic states can give rise to novel anomalous Hall effects. The potential appearance of these effects at room temperature holds promise for their application in magnetic sensing, spintronics, and energy harvesting technology. The anomalous in-plane Hall effect (IPHE) is predicted to arise in topological magnetic materials when an external magnetic field is applied within the sample plane. Because of stringent symmetry requirements, the conclusive detection of the anomalous IPHE induced by topological electronic states remains challenging, and the study of anomalous Hall effects is often confined to cryogenic conditions. Combining molecular beam epitaxy of the kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn with measurements of the electric Hall effect and theoretical calculations, we propose and experimentally demonstrate that the interplay of the kagome lattice motif with spin-orbit coupling and canted ferromagnetism with large exchange interactions gives rise to the anomalous IPHE at room temperature that is induced by topological Weyl points in the electronic band structure. Synthesizing a topological heterostructure including layers of Fe$_3$Sn and ferromagnetic CoFeB, we further show the enhancement of the anomalous IPHE through the magnetic stray field of the CoFeB layer. Our work establishes a design paradigm for topological magnets and heterostructures to discover and control novel anomalous Hall effects toward their use in technological applications.

Title: Fragile Unconventional Magnetism in RuO$_2$ by Proximity to Landau-Pomeranchuk Instability
Authors: Zhuang Qian, Yudi Yang, Shi Liu, Congjun Wu
Abstract: Altermagnetism has attracted considerable attention for its remarkable combination of spin-polarized band structures and zero net magnetization, making it a promising candidate for spintronics applications. We demonstrate that this magnetic phase represents a case of ``unconventional magnetism," first proposed nearly two decades ago by one of the present authors as part of a broader framework for understanding Landau-Pomeranchuk instabilities in the spin channel, driven by many-body interactions. By systematically analyzing the altermagnetism in RuO$_2$ with first-principles calculations, we reconcile conflicting experimental and theoretical reports by attributing it to RuO$_2$'s proximity to a quantum phase transition. We emphasize the critical role of tuning parameters, such as the Hubbard $U$, hole doping, and epitaxial strain, in modulating quasiparticle interactions near the Fermi surface. This work provides fresh insights into the origin and tunability of altermagnetism in RuO$_2$, highlighting its potential as a platform for investigating quantum phase transitions and the broader realm of unconventional magnetism.

Title: Structural and Transport Properties of Thin InAs Layers Grown on InxAl1-xAs Metamorphic Buffers
Authors: Giulio Senesi, Katarzyna Skibinska, Alessandro Paghi, Gaurav Shukla, Francesco Giazotto, Fabio Beltram, Stefan Heun, Lucia Sorba
Abstract: Indium Arsenide is a III-V semiconductor with low electron effective mass, a small band gap, strong spin-orbit coupling, and a large g-factor. These properties and its surface Fermi level pinned in the conduction band make InAs a good candidate for developing superconducting solid-state quantum devices. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of very thin InAs layers with thicknesses ranging from 12.5 nm to 500 nm grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy on InxAl1-xAs metamorphic buffers. Differently than InAs substrates, these buffers have the advantage of being insulating at cryogenic temperatures, which allows for multiple device operations on the same wafer and thus making the approach scalable. The structural properties of the InAs layers were investigated by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, demonstrating the high crystal quality of the InAs layers. Furthermore, their transport properties, such as total and sheet carrier concentration, sheet resistance, and carrier mobility, were measured in the van der Pauw configuration at room temperature. A simple conduction model was employed to quantify the surface, bulk, and interface contributions to the overall carrier concentration and mobility.

Title: Emergent Polar Metal Phase in a Van der Waals Mott Magnet

Abstract: We report the emergence of a polar metal phase in layered van der Waals compound FePSe$_3$. This Mott insulator with antiferromagnetic order offers a unique opportunity to fully tune an insulator into a polar metal state with pressure, without doping-induced disorder or impurities. Our synchrotron and neutron diffraction data unambiguously show a structural transition and loss of the inversion symmetry. We also observed the suppression of magnetic ordering and an insulator-to-metal transition correspondent with this structural transformation. The loss of the inversion symmetry combined with the pressure-induced metallicity in FePSe$_3$ offers a new platform to investigate polar metallicity at accessible pressures. Moreover, the high-pressure metallic phase shows unconventional resistivity deviating from the Fermi-liquid description, close to the magnetic critical transition pressure at sufficiently low temperatures, which strongly suggests underlying quantum criticality. Our work not only explores the comprehensive temperature-pressure phase diagram of FePSe$_3$ but also provides insights for further investigation of van der Waals strongly correlated magnetic compounds.

Title: Topological semimetal with coexisting nodal points and nodal lines
Authors: Bing-Bing Luo, Ming-Jian Gao, Jun-Hong An
Abstract: Featuring exotic quantum transport and surface states, topological semimetals can be classified into nodal-point, nodal-line, and nodal-surface semimetals according to the degeneracy and dimensionality of their nodes. The coexistence of diverse categories of topological semimetals is of particular interest as it enables the concurrent utilization of their respective beneficial features. However, topological semimetals that possess both nodal points and nodal lines are rarely reported. Here, we propose a scheme to construct this unprecedented topological semimetal, which particularly exhibits second-order hinge Fermi arcs connecting projected nodal lines. Then, by applying periodic driving on the system, we find a hybrid-order topological semimetal with nodal points and rich nodal-lines structures and its conversion into the first-order topological semimetal, which are absent in the static system. Our results enrich the family of topological semimetals, thereby establishing a foundation for further exploration into the potential applications of these materials.

Title: Scattering Insights into Shear-Induced Scission of Rod-like Micelles
Authors: Guan-Rong Huang, Ryan P. Murphy, Lionel Porcar, Chi-Huan Tung, Changwoo Do, Wei-Ren Chen
Abstract: Hypothesis Understanding the scission of rod-like micelles under mechanical forces is crucial for optimizing their stability and behavior in industrial applications. This study investigates how micelle length, flexibility, and external forces interact, offering insights into the design of micellar systems in processes influenced by mechanical stress. Although significant, direct experimental observations of flow-induced micellar scission using scattering techniques remain scarce. Experiments and Simulations Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) is used to explore the shear response of aqueous cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solutions with sodium nitrate. Rheological tests show shear thinning with no shear banding, ensuring a uniform flow field for reliable interpretation of scattering data. As shear rate increases, the scattering spectra show angular distortion, which is analyzed using spherical harmonic decomposition to characterize flow-induced scission and micelle orientation under shear. Findings Two analysis steps are used: a model-independent spectral eigendecomposition reveals a decrease in micellar length, while regression analysis quantifies the evolution of the length distribution and mean length with shear rate. Additionally, micelle alignment increases with shear, quantified by the orientational distribution function. These findings provide experimental evidence for flow-induced alignment and scission, offering a new framework for understanding shear-induced phenomena in micellar systems

Title: Revealing turbulent Dark Matter via merging of self-Gravitating condensates
Authors: Anirudh Sivakumar, Pankaj Kumar Mishra, Ahmad A. Hujeirat, Paulsamy Muruganandam
Abstract: Self-gravitating condensates have been proposed as potential candidates for modelling dark matter. In this paper, we numerically investigate the dynamics of dark matter utilizing the merging of self-gravitating condensates. We have used the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson model and identified distinct turbulent regimes based on the merging speed of the condensate. As a result of collision, we notice the appearance of various dark soliton-mediated instabilities that finally lead to the turbulent state characterized by Kolmogorov-like turbulence scaling \( \varepsilon_{\mathrm{kin}}^i \sim k^{-5/3} \) in the infrared and \( \varepsilon_{\mathrm{kin}}^i \sim k^{-3} \) in the ultraviolet regions. The compressible spectrum suggests weak-wave turbulence. The turbulent fluctuations in the condensate cease as the vortices formed via soliton decay are expelled to the condensate's periphery, manifested in the transferring of kinetic energy from incompressible and compressible flows to the quantum pressure energy. We also establish the significant role played by the self-gravitating trap in determining the distribution of compressible kinetic energy and the resulting density waves, which differ markedly from those observed in atomic condensates under harmonic confinement. Our study may offer valuable insights into the merging of binary stars and open new avenues for understanding the structure and dynamics of the dark matter through self-gravitating condensate.

Abstract: To lessen the quick depletion of fossil fuels and the resulting environmental harm, it is necessary to investigate effective and eco-friendly materials that can convert lost energy into electricity. The structural, optical, electronic, thermo-electric, and thermodynamic properties of the novel half-Heusler (HH) material NaVTe were examined in the current work using density functional theory (DFT). The Birch-Murnaghan equations of states were used to confirm the structural stability of the NaVTe HH alloy under investigation. These equations show that the compound in question has structural stability because its ground-state energy levels are negative. For spin-down configurations, NaVTe possesses an energy band gap of 3.2 eV, according to band structure and total density of state analysis. NaVTe is a material that is desirable for optoelectronic applications due to its optical features, which include maximum conductivity and absorption of electromagnetic radiation. The figure of merit and other thermodynamic and thermoelectric parameters are calculated. According to these predicted outcomes, the NaVTe HH alloy would be the ideal option for thermo-electric and renewable energy applications.

Title: Gauge-invariant electromagnetic responses in superconductors
Authors: Sena Watanabe, Haruki Watanabe
Abstract: Gauge invariance is of fundamental importance to make physically meaningful predictions. In superconductors, the use of mean-field Hamiltonians that lack $U(1)$ symmetry often leads to gauge-dependent results. While solutions to this problem for the linear response of conventional superconductors have been well-known, a unified understanding for unconventional superconductors or nonlinear responses has not been established. This study provides the full detail of the general theoretical framework that allows us to compute responses at arbitrary orders in external fields in a gauge-invariant manner for both conventional and unconventional superconductors. Our construction generalizes the consistent fluctuations of order parameters method for full photon vertices and has a pictorial illustration using Feynman diagrams of the response kernel.

Title: Large Deviations in Switching Diffusion: from Free Cumulants to Dynamical Transitions
Authors: Mathis Guéneau, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr
Abstract: We study the diffusion of a particle with a time-dependent diffusion constant $D(t)$ that switches between random values drawn from a distribution $W(D)$ at a fixed rate $r$. Using a renewal approach, we compute exactly the moments of the position of the particle $\langle x^{2n}(t) \rangle$ at any finite time $t$, and for any $W(D)$ with finite moments $\langle D^n \rangle$. For $t \gg 1$, we demonstrate that the cumulants $\langle x^{2n}(t) \rangle_c$ grow linearly with $t$ and are proportional to the free cumulants of a random variable distributed according to $W(D)$. For specific forms of $W(D)$, we compute the large deviations of the position of the particle, uncovering rich behaviors and dynamical transitions of the rate function $I(y=x/t)$. Our analytical predictions are validated numerically with high precision, achieving accuracy up to $10^{-2000}$.

Title: Magnetic measurements under high pressure with a quantum sensor in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Lun-Xuan Yu, Nai-Jie Guo
Abstract: Magnetic measurements under high-pressure conditions are pivotal for the study of superconductivity and magnetic materials but remain challenging due to the micrometer-sized sample in diamond anvil cells (DAC). In this study, we propose a quantum sensing approach utilizing negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_B^-$) spin defects in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride for high resolution magnetic measurements under pressure. The optical and spin properties of VB$^-$ defects were systematically studied under high-pressure conditions, revealing a significant pressure-induced shift in zero-field splitting (ZFS), approximately three times larger than that of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. Furthermore, we demonstrate the pressure-dependent magnetic transition and variations in the Curie temperature of van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ flake using V$_B^-$ defects under pressures. Notably, the maximum operational pressure for V$_B^-$ defects was determined to be approximately 11 GPa, attributed to a structural phase transition in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). This work establishes the way for two-dimensional quantum sensing technologies under high-pressure environments.

Title: Measurement of the Casimir force between superconductors
Authors: Matthijs H. J. de Jong, Evren Korkmazgil, Louise Banniard, Mika A. Sillanpää, Laure Mercier de Lépinay
Abstract: The Casimir force follows from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and yields a nonlinear attractive force between closely spaced conductive objects. Its magnitude depends on the conductivity of the objects up to optical frequencies. Measuring the Casimir force in superconductors should allow to isolate frequency-specific contributions to the Casimir effect, as frequencies below the superconducting gap energy are expected to contribute differently than those above it. There is significant interest in this contribution as it is suspected to contribute to an unexplained discrepancy between predictions and measurements of the Casimir force, which questions the basic principles on which estimates of the magnitude are based. Here, we observe the Casimir force between superconducting objects for the first time, through the nonlinear dynamics it imparts to a superconducting drum resonator in a microwave optomechanical system. There is excellent agreement between the experiment and the Casimir force magnitude computed for this device across three orders of magnitude of displacement. Furthermore, the Casimir nonlinearity is intense enough that, with a modified design, this device type should operate in the single-phonon nonlinear regime. Accessing this regime has been a long-standing goal that would greatly facilitate quantum operations of mechanical resonators.

Title: Crossed Andreev reflection in collinear $p$-wave magnet-triplet superconductor junctions
Authors: Abhiram Soori
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a fundamental quantum transport phenomenon with significant implications for spintronics and superconducting devices. However, its experimental detection and enhancement remain challenging. In this work, we propose a junction comprising $p$-wave magnets and a triplet superconductor as a promising platform to enhance CAR. The setup features a triplet superconductor sandwiched between two collinear $p$-wave magnets, rotated by $180^\circ$ relative to one another, enabling precise control of transport processes. We show that CAR can dominate over electron tunneling (ET) for specific parameter regimes, such as the orientation angle of the $p$-wave magnets and the chemical potential. Enhanced CAR is achieved when the constant energy contours of the two spins in the $p$-wave magnets are well-separated. Additionally, the conductivities exhibit Fabry-Pérot-type oscillations due to interference effects, with CAR diminishing as the superconductor length exceeds the decay length of the wavefunctions. These findings highlight the potential of collinear $p$-wave magnet-superconductor junctions as a robust platform for the experimental study and enhancement of CAR.

Title: Ab initio modeling of single-photon detection in superconducting nanowires
Authors: Alejandro Simon, Reed Foster, Mihir Sahoo, James Shi, Emma Batson, Francesca Incalza, Christoph Heil, Karl K. Berggren
Abstract: Using a kinetic equation approach and Density Functional Theory, we model the nonequilibrium quasiparticle and phonon dynamics of a thin superconducting film under optical irradiation ab initio. We extend this model to develop a theory for the detection of single photons in superconducting nanowires. In doing so, we create a framework for exploring new superconducting materials for enhanced device performance beyond the state-of-the-art. Though we focus in this study on superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, these methods are general, and they can be extended to model other superconducting devices, including transition-edge sensors, microwave resonators, and superconducting qubits. Our methods effectively integrate ab initio materials modeling with models of nonequilibrium superconductivity to perform practical modeling of superconducting devices, providing a comprehensive approach that connects fundamental theory with device-level applications.

Title: Exploring the role of hydrodynamic interactions in spherically-confined drying colloidal suspensions
Authors: Mayukh Kundu, Kritika Kritika, Yashraj M. Wani, Arash Nikoubashman, Michael P. Howard
Abstract: We study the distribution of colloidal particles confined in drying spherical droplets using both dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) and particle-based simulations. In particular, we focus on the advection-dominated regime typical of aqueous droplets drying at room temperature and systematically investigate the role of hydrodynamic interactions during this nonequilibrium process. In general, drying produces transient particle concentration gradients within the droplet in this regime, with a considerable accumulation of particles at the droplet's liquid-vapor interface. We find that these gradients become significantly larger with pairwise hydrodynamic interactions between colloidal particles instead of a free-draining hydrodynamic approximation; however, the solvent's boundary conditions at the droplet's interface (unbounded, slip, or no-slip) do not have a significant effect on the particle distribution. DDFT calculations leveraging radial symmetry of the drying droplet are in excellent agreement with particle-based simulations for free-draining hydrodynamics, but DDFT unexpectedly fails for pairwise hydrodynamic interactions after the particle concentration increases during drying, manifesting as an ejection of particles from the droplet. We hypothesize that this unphysical behavior originates from an inaccurate approximation of the two-body density correlations based on the bulk pair correlation function, which we support by measuring the confined equilibrium two-body density correlations using particle-based simulations. We identify some potential strategies for addressing this issue in DDFT.

Title: Three-Dimensional to Layered Halide Perovskites: A Parameter-Free Hybrid Functional Method for Predicting Electronic Band Gaps
Authors: Ibrahim Buba Garba (1), Lorenzo Trombini (1), Claudine Katan (1), Jacky Even (2), Marios Zacharias (2), Mikael Kepenekian (1), George Volonakis (1) ( (1) Univ Rennes, ENSCR, CNRS, ISCR (Institut des Sciences Chimiques de Rennes), UMR 6226, France, (2) Univ Rennes, INSA Rennes, CNRS, Institut FOTON - UMR 6082, Rennes, France)
Abstract: Accurately predicting electronic band gaps in halide perovskites using ab initio density functional theory (DFT) is essential for their application in optoelectronic devices. Standard hybrid functionals such as HSE and PBE0 can overcome the limitations of DFT with reasonable computational cost but are known to underestimate the measured band gaps for layered halide perovskites. In this study, we assess the performance of the doubly screened dielectric-dependent hybrid (DSH) functional for predicting band gaps in three-dimensional (3D) and layered hybrid perovskites. We show that the DSH functional, which employs material-dependent mixing parameters derived from macroscopic dielectric constants, provides accurate band gap predictions for 3D halide perovskites when structural local disorder is considered. For layered hybrid perovskites, DSH functional based on average dielectric constants overestimates the band gaps. To improve the predictions and stay in a parameter-free ab initio workflow, we propose to use the calculated dielectric constant of the respective 3D perovskites. We find that the DSH functionals using the dielectric constants of the 3D perovskite accurately predict experimental gaps, with the lowest mean absolute errors compared to HSE and PBE0 for layered perovskites with various organic spacers, as well as for multilayered $BA_2MA_{n-1}Pb_{n}I_{3n-1}$ with n = 2, 3. Notably, the HSE functional systematically underestimates the band gaps in layered perovskites. We attribute the root of this failure to the absence of non-local long-range dielectric screening, a critical factor for halide perovskites. The computational framework introduced here provides an efficient parameter-free ab initio methodology for predicting the electronic properties of 3D and layered halide perovskites and their heterostructures, aiding in developing advanced optoelectronic devices.

Title: Disclinations, dislocations, and emanant flux at Dirac criticality
Authors: Maissam Barkeshli, Christopher Fechisin, Zohar Komargodski, Siwei Zhong
Abstract: What happens when fermions hop on a lattice with crystalline defects? The answer depends on topological quantum numbers which specify the action of lattice rotations and translations in the low energy theory. One can understand the topological quantum numbers as a twist of continuum gauge fields in terms of crystalline gauge fields. We find that disclinations and dislocations -- defects of crystalline symmetries -- generally lead in the continuum to a certain ``emanant'' quantized magnetic flux. To demonstrate these facts, we study in detail tight-binding models whose low-energy descriptions are (2+1)D Dirac cones. Our map from lattice to continuum defects explains the crystalline topological response to disclinations and dislocations, and motivates the fermion crystalline equivalence principle used in the classification of crystalline topological phases. When the gap closes, the presence of emanant flux leads to pair creation from the vacuum with the particles and anti-particles swirling around the defect. We compute the associated currents and energy density using the tools of defect conformal field theory. There is a rich set of renormalization group fixed points, depending on how particles scatter from the defect. At half flux, there is a defect conformal manifold leading to a continuum of possible low-energy theories. We present extensive numerical evidence supporting the emanant magnetic flux at lattice defects and we test our map between lattice and continuum defects in detail. We also point out a no-go result, which implies that a single (2+1)D Dirac cone in symmetry class AII is incompatible with a commuting $C_M$ rotational symmetry with $(C_M)^M = +1$.

Title: Approach to nonequilibrium: from anomalous to Brownian diffusion via non-Gaussianity
Authors: I. G. Marchenko, I. I. Marchenko, J. Łuczka, J. Spiechowicz
Abstract: Recent progress in experimental techniques such as single particle tracking allows to analyze both nonequilibrium properties and approach to equilibrium. There are examples showing that processes occurring at finite timescales are distinctly different than their equilibrium counterparts. In this work we analyze a similar problem of approach to nonequilibrium. We consider an archetypal model of nonequilibrium system consisting of a Brownian particle dwelling in a spatially periodic potential and driven by an external time-periodic force. We focus on a diffusion process and monitor its development in time. In the presented parameter regime the excess kurtosis measuring the Gaussianity of the particle displacement distribution evolves in a non-monotonic way: first it is negative (platykurtic form), next it becomes positive (leptokurtic form) and then decays to zero (mesokurtic form). Despite the latter fact diffusion in the long time limit is Brownian, yet non-Gaussian. Moreover, we discover a correlation between non-Gaussianity of the particle displacement distribution and transient anomalous diffusion behavior emerging for finite timescales.

Title: Grain-size dependence of plastic-brittle transgranular fracture
Authors: Jean-Michel Scherer, Mythreyi Ramesh, Blaise Bourdin, Kaushik Bhattacharya
Abstract: The role of grain size in determining fracture toughness in metals is incompletely understood with apparently contradictory experimental observations. We study this grain-size dependence computationally by building a model that combines the phase-field formulation of fracture mechanics with dislocation density-based crystal plasticity. We apply the model to cleavage fracture of body-centered cubic materials in plane strain conditions, and find non-monotonic grain-size dependence of plastic-brittle transgranular fracture. We find two mechanisms at play. The first is the nucleation of failure due to cross-slip in critically located grains within transgranular band of localized deformation, and this follows the classical Hall-Petch law that predicts a higher failure stress for smaller grains. The second is the resistance to the propagation of a mode I crack, where grain boundaries can potentially pin a crack, and this follows an inverse Hall-Petch law with higher toughness for larger grains. The result of the competition between the two mechanisms gives rise to non-monotonic behavior and reconciles the apparently contradictory experimental observations.

Title: Topological $X$-states in a quantum impurity model
Authors: Moallison F. Cavalcante, Marcus V. S. Bonança, Eduardo Miranda, Sebastian Deffner
Abstract: Topological qubits are inherently resistant to noise and errors. However, experimental demonstrations have been elusive as their realization and control is highly complex. In the present work, we demonstrate the emergence of topological $X$-states in the long-time response of a locally perturbed quantum impurity model. The emergence of the double-qubit state is heralded by the lack of decay of the response function as well as the out-of-time order correlator signifying the trapping of excitations, and hence information in local edge modes.

Abstract: Magnetic vector tomography allows for visualizing the 3D magnetization vector of magnetic nanostructures and multilayers with nanometric resolution. In this work, we present MARTApp (Magnetic Analysis and Reconstruction of Tomographies Application), a software designed to analyze the images obtained from a full-field or scanning transmission X-ray microscope and reconstruct the 3D magnetization of the sample. Here, its workflow and main features are described. Moreover, a synthetic test sample consisting of a hopfion is used to exemplify the workflow from raw images to the final 3D magnetization reconstruction.

Title: Localization of Dirac modes in a finite temperature SU(2) Higgs model
Authors: György Baranka, Matteo Giordano
Abstract: Low-lying Dirac modes become localized at the finite-temperature transition in QCD and other gauge theories, indicating a strong connection between localization and deconfinement. This phenomenon can be understood through the "sea/islands" picture: in the deconfined phase, modes become trapped on "islands" of Polyakov loop fluctuations within a "sea" of ordered Polyakov loops. To test the universality of the "sea/islands" mechanism, we investigate whether changes in the localization properties of low modes occur across other thermal transitions where the Polyakov loop becomes ordered, beyond the usual deconfinement transition. The fixed-length SU(2)-Higgs model is appropriate for this study. After mapping out the phase diagram, we find that low Dirac modes become localized in the deconfined and Higgs phases, where the Polyakov loop is ordered. However, localization is absent in the confined phase. These findings confirm the "sea/islands" picture of localization.

Title: Native Three-Body Interactions in a Superconducting Lattice Gauge Quantum Simulator
Authors: J.H. Busnaina, Z. Shi, Jesús M. Alcaine-Cuervo, Cindy X. Yang, I. Nsanzineza, E. Rico, C.M. Wilson
Abstract: While universal quantum computers remain under development, analog quantum simulators offer a powerful alternative for understanding complex systems in condensed matter, chemistry, and high-energy physics. One compelling application is the characterization of real-time lattice gauge theories (LGTs). LGTs are nonperturbative tools, utilizing discretized spacetime to describe gauge-invariant models. They hold immense potential for understanding fundamental physics but require enforcing local constraints analogous to electromagnetism's Gauss's Law. These constraints, which arise from gauge symmetries and dictate the form of the interaction between matter and gauge fields, are a significant challenge for simulators to enforce. Implementing these constraints at the hardware level in analog simulations is crucial. This requires realizing multibody interactions between matter and gauge-field elements, enabling them to evolve together while suppressing unwanted two-body interactions that violate the gauge symmetry. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel parametrically activated three-qubit interaction within a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. We experimentally demonstrate a minimal $U(1)$ spin-1/2 model with a time evolution that intrinsically satisfies Gauss's law in the system. This design serves as the foundational block for simulating LGTs on a superconducting photonic lattice.

Title: Algebraic skin effect in two-dimensional non-Hermitian metamaterials
Authors: Mingyang Li, Jing Lin, Kun Ding
Abstract: Metamaterials have unlocked unprecedented control over light by leveraging novel mechanisms to expand their functionality. Non-Hermitian physics further enhances the tunability of non-Hermitian metamaterials (NHMs) through phenomena such as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), enabling applications like directional amplification. The higher-dimensional NHSE manifests unique effects, including the algebraic skin effect (ASE), which features power-law decay instead of exponential localization, allowing for quasi-long-range interactions. In this work, we establish apparent criteria for achieving ASE in two-dimensional reciprocal NHMs with anisotropic and complex dielectric tensors. By numerically and theoretically demonstrating ASE through mismatched optical axes and geometric structures, we reveal that ASE is governed by a generalized Fermi surface whose dimensionality exceeds that of the Fermi surface. We further propose and validate a realistic photonic crystal design for ASE, which is experimentally accessible. Our recipe for ASE provides a versatile pathway for broader generalizations, including three-dimensional structures, synthetic dimensions, and other classical wave systems, paving the way for advancements in non-Hermitian photonics.

Title: A simplified method for full-wave simulation of metamaterials: utilizing near-field decoupling technology
Authors: Junming Zhang, Weijia Luo, Yongzheng Wen, Jingbo Sun, Ji Zhou
Abstract: Simulating the electromagnetic properties of large-scale, complex metamaterial structures demands significant time and memory resources. If these large-scale structures can be divided into smaller, simpler components, the overall cost of studying all the smaller structures could be much lower than directly simulating the entire structure. Unfortunately, decoupling complex structures has been challenging due to the unclear mechanisms of near-field coupling in metamaterials. In this paper, we identify that the key to understanding near-field coupling in metamaterials lies in evanescent wave interactions, which can be captured through full-wave simulations. Our findings suggest that by accounting for the influence of evanescent waves, it becomes possible to analytically decouple and then recouple structures, even when the types of metamaterial structures vary. Building on this insight, we successfully decomposed complex structures into multiple groups of simpler components. By studying these simpler components, the electromagnetic properties of the entire structure can be calculated analytically. This decoupling method dramatically reduces the computation time or memory required for research into the electromagnetic properties of metamaterials.

Title: Symmetry Breaking Dynamics in Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Hui Yu, Zi-Xiang Li, Shi-Xin Zhang
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry has emerged as a novel tool for characterizing symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we investigate how symmetry is dynamically broken through the lens of entanglement asymmetry in two distinct scenarios: a non-symmetric random quantum circuit and a non-symmetric Hamiltonian quench, with a particular focus on U(1) symmetry. In the former case, the symmetry is first broken and then restored while in the latter case, symmetry remains broken in the subsystem at late times, aligning with the concept of quantum thermalization. Entanglement asymmetry growth exhibits unexpected overshooting behavior at early times in both contexts. We also consider dynamics of non-symmetric initial states under the symmetry-breaking evolution. Due to the competition of symmetry-breaking in both the initial state and Hamiltonian, the early-time entanglement asymmetry displays two qualitatively different behaviors. Furthermore, quantum Mpemba effects remain evident despite the presence of weak symmetry-breaking in both settings.

Title: (111) Si spin qubits constructed on L point of band structure
Authors: Takafumi Tokunaga, Hiromichi Nakazato
Abstract: (001) Si spin qubits are being intensively studied because they have structures similar to that of CMOS devices currently being produced, and thus have the advantage of utilizing state-of-the-art miniaturization, integration, and variation-reduction-technologies. However, there are still issues, such as further improvement of relaxation and decoherence time, stabilization of valley-splitting control, and reduction of the variation caused by the roughness of the interface. In this study, new measures are proposed to address these three issues. Instead of confining an electron to the minimum energy point $X_0$ of the conduction band along the band structure $\Gamma-\Delta-X$ in (001) Si crystals, we propose confining an electron to the L point along $\Gamma-\Lambda-L$ in (111) Si crystals. At the $X_0$ point, the symmetry causes spin-orbit interaction to act on the electron, and the sixfold degeneracy is lifted into a fourfold and a twofold, and the valley-splitting of the twofold conflicts with the two-level system. In the symmetry of the $L$ point, substantial spin polarization disappears, facilitating the reduction of the spin-orbit interaction, and the fourfold degeneracy is lifted to threefold and single, and the single becomes ground state. The need to increase the magnitude of the valley-splitting is exempt, allowing the electron to be controlled away from the interface, which is expected to reduce the variation caused by the roughness of the interface. Data on the confinement of an electron to the $L$ point and the control of fourfold degeneracy are needed, and it is hoped that prototype silicon spin qubits constructed on (111) Si crystals will be developed and that the proposed device structure will help implement quantum computers based on Si devices.

Title: Overcoming temperature limitations in laser cooling using dressed states and diamond vacancies
Authors: Paul R. Eastham, Conor N. Murphy, Luisa Toledo Tude
Abstract: The established approach to laser cooling of solids relies on anti-Stokes fluorescence, for example from rare earth impurities in glass. Although successful, there is a minimum temperature to which such a process can cool set by the electronic level spacing in the impurity. We propose an alternative method which does not suffer from this limitation. Our approach relies on the formation of dressed states under strong laser driving, which generates a spectrum in which the gaps can be tuned to optimize the heat absorption. This allows for a cooling cycle which operates at any temperature with a power comparable to the maximum dictated by thermodynamic principles. While this cooling cycle will compete with heating due to non-radiative decay and other mechanisms, it could in principle allow laser cooling to temperatures which are unachievable with anti-Stokes fluorescence.

Title: Transfer matrix approach to quantum systems subject to certain Lindblad evolution
Authors: Junaid Majeed Bhat, Marko Znidaric
Abstract: Solving for time evolution of a many particle system whose dynamics is governed by Lindblad equation is hard. We extend the use of transfer matrix approach to a class of Linblad equations that admit a closed hierarchy of two point correlators. An example that we treat is the XX spin chain, i.e., free fermions, subject to the local on-site dephasing, but can be extended to other Hermitian dissipators, e.g., non-local dephasing. We find a simple expression of the Green's function in the Laplace domain. The method can be used to get analytical results in the thermodynamic limit, for instance, to get the evolution of magnetization density and to explicitly see the cross over between the ballistic and diffusive behavior, or to show that the correlations between operators at distance $l$ decay with time as $1/t^{\lceil l/2 \rceil+1/2}$. It also provides a fast numerical method to determine the evolution of the density with a complexity scaling with the system size more favorably than in previous methods, easily allowing one to study systems with $\sim 10^6$ spins.

Title: Information-theoretic limits and approximate message-passing for high-dimensional time series
Authors: Daria Tieplova, Samriddha Lahiry, Jean Barbier
Abstract: High-dimensional time series appear in many scientific setups, demanding a nuanced approach to model and analyze the underlying dependence structure. However, theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signals. In this contribution, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm and show that, despite a lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.

Title: Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells
Authors: David Zwicker, Oliver W. Paulin, Cathelijne ter Burg
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.

Title: Characterizing phase transitions and criticality in non-Hermitian extensions of the XY model
Authors: D. C. Liu, Murray T. Batchelor
Abstract: In this work we study non-Hermitian extensions of the paradigmatic spin-1/2 XY chain in a magnetic field. Using the mapping of the model to free fermion form, we provide analytical insights into the energy spectrum of the non-Hermitian model and establish an intrinsic connection between the quasienergies and topological invariants. We also use exact diagonalization as a supplementary method to examine the performance of biorthogonal-based expectation values. Our results confirm that the theoretical analysis is consistent with the numerical results, with the extended phase diagram determined via the analytical solution and the critical behavior of the fidelity and entanglement. The entanglement transition goes hand in hand with the non-Hermitian topological phase transition. Like the Hermitian case, we analyze the critical behavior using finite-size scaling. Our results show that non-Hermiticity can induce the system into a new universality class with unusual critical exponent. We also emphasize the ability of the Loschmidt echo to characterize potential phase transitions and introduce the average of the Loschmidt echo to describe phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Exploring the interplay between small and large scales movements in a neotropical small mammal
Authors: E. Brigatti, B. Ríos-Uzeda, M. V. Vieira
Abstract: We record and analyze the movement patterns of the marsupial {\it Didelphis aurita} at different temporal scales. Animals trajectories are collected at a daily scale by using spool-and-line techniques, and with the help of radio-tracking devices animals traveled distances are estimated at intervals of weeks. Small-scale movements are well described by truncated Lévy flight, while large-scale movements produce a distribution of distances which is compatible with a Brownian motion. A model of the movement behavior of these animals, based on a truncated Lévy flight calibrated on the small scale data, converges towards a Brownian behavior after a short time interval of the order of one week. These results show that whether Lévy flight or Brownian motion behaviors apply, will depend on the scale of aggregation of the animals paths. In this specific case, as the effect of the rude truncation present in the daily data generates a fast convergence towards Brownian behaviors, Lévy flights become of scarce interest for describing the local dispersion properties of these animals, which result well approximated by a normal diffusion process and not a fast, anomalous one. Interestingly, we are able to describe two movement phases as the consequence of a statistical effect generated by aggregation, without the necessity of introducing ecological constraints or mechanisms operating at different spatio-temporal scales. This result is of general interest, as it can be a key element for describing movement phenomenology at distinct spatio-temporal scales across different taxa and in a variety of systems.

Title: Efficient Fermi-Hubbard model ground-state preparation by coupling to a classical reservoir in the instantaneous-response limit
Authors: Zekun He, A. F. Kemper, J. K. Freericks
Abstract: Preparing the ground state of the Fermi-Hubbard model is challenging, in part due to the exponentially large Hilbert space, which complicates efficiently finding a path from an initial state to the ground state using the variational principle. In this work, we propose an approach for ground state preparation of interacting models by involving a classical reservoir, simplified to the instantaneous-response limit, which can be described using a Hamiltonian formalism. The resulting time evolution operator consist of spin-adapted nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site interaction terms similar to those in the Hubbard model, without expanding the Hilbert space. We can engineer the coupling to rapidly drive the system from an initial product state to its interacting ground state by numerically minimizing the final state energy. This ansatz closely resembles the Hamiltonian variational ansatz, offering a fresh perspective on it.

Title: Exponentially slow thermalization in 1D fragmented dynamics
Authors: Cheng Wang, Shankar Balasubramanian, Yiqiu Han, Ethan Lake, Xiao Chen, Zhi-Cheng Yang
Abstract: We investigate the thermalization dynamics of 1D systems with local constraints coupled to an infinite temperature bath at one boundary. The coupling to the bath eventually erases the effects of the constraints, causing the system to tend towards a maximally mixed state at long times. We show that for a large class of local constraints, the time at which thermalization occurs can be extremely long. In particular, we present evidence for the following conjecture: when the constrained dynamics displays strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the thermalization time diverges exponentially with system size. We show that this conjecture holds for a wide range of dynamical constraints, including dipole-conserving dynamics, the $tJ_z$ model, and a large class of group-based dynamics, and relate a general proof of our conjecture to a different conjecture about the existence of certain expander graphs.

Title: Theory of thermopolarization effect
Authors: Yugo Onishi, Hiroki Isobe, Atsuo Shitade, Naoto Nagaosa
Abstract: We study the polarization response to the temperature gradient in insulators, known as the thermopolarization effect. We show that this response can be understood through the free energy response function to an electric field gradient, which we call Q-tensor. By using the Q-tensor, we present a unified description of the polarization responses to both electric fields and temperature gradients and derive the generalized Mott relation. Additionally, we draw an analogy with the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects. These effects are observable as the Seebeck effect where the linear size of the system is shorter than the screening length.

Title: Topological Phases with Average Symmetries: the Decohered, the Disordered, and the Intrinsic
Authors: Ruochen Ma, Jian-Hao Zhang, Zhen Bi, Meng Cheng, Chong Wang
Abstract: Global symmetries greatly enrich the landscape of topological quantum phases, playing an essential role from topological insulators to fractional quantum Hall effect. Topological phases in mixed quantum states, originating from \textit{decoherence} in open quantum systems or \textit{disorders} in imperfect crystalline solids, have recently garnered significant interest. Unlike pure states, mixed quantum states can exhibit \textit{average symmetries} -- symmetries that keep the total ensemble invariant but not on each individual state. In this work, we present a systematic classification and characterization of average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases applicable to generic symmetry groups, encompassing both average and exact symmetries, for bosonic and fermionic systems. Moreover, we formulate the theory of average symmetry-enriched topological (ASET) orders in disordered bosonic systems. Our systematic approach helps clarify nuanced issues in previous literature and uncovers compelling new physics. Notably, we discover that (1) the definition and classification of ASPT phases in decohered and disordered systems exhibit subtle differences; (2) despite these differences, ASPT phases in both settings can be classified and characterized under a unified framework of defect decoration and spectral sequence; (3) this systematic classification uncovers a plethora of ASPT phases that are \textit{intrinsically mixed}, implying they can exclusively manifest in decohered or disordered systems where part of the symmetry is average; (4) similarly for ASET, we find intrinsically disordered phases exhibiting exotic anyon behaviors -- the ground states of such phases necessarily contain localized anyons, with gapless (yet still localized) excitation spectral.

Title: Stochastic dynamics of granular hopper flows: a configurational mode controls the stability of clogs
Authors: David Hathcock, Sam Dillavou, Jesse M. Hanlan, Douglas J. Durian, Yuhai Tu
Abstract: Granular flows in small-outlet hoppers exhibit several characteristic but poorly understood behaviors: temporary clogs (pauses) where flow stops before later spontaneously restarting, permanent clogs that last indefinitely, and non-Gaussian, non-monotonic flow-rate statistics. These aspects have been studied independently, but a model of hopper flow that includes all three has not been formulated. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model that provides a unifying dynamical explanation of all three behaviors: coupling between the flow rate and a hidden mode that controls the stability of clogs. In the theory, flow rate evolves according to Langevin dynamics with multiplicative noise and an absorbing state at zero flow, conditional on the hidden mode. The model fully reproduces the statistics of pause and clog events of a large ($>40,000$ flows) experimental dataset, including non-exponentially distributed clogging times and non-Gaussian flow rate distribution, and explains the stretched-exponential growth of the average clogging time with outlet size. Further, we identify the physical nature of the hidden mode in microscopic configurational features, including size and smoothness of the static arch structure formed during pauses and clogs. Our work provides a unifying framework for several poorly understood clogging phenomena, and suggests numerous new paths toward further understanding of this complex system.

Title: Multifractality of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect
Authors: Shu Hamanaka, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates induced by nonreciprocal dissipation, plays a pivotal role in non-Hermitian topology and significantly influences the open quantum dynamics. However, its genuinely quantum characterization in many-body systems has yet to be developed. Here, we elucidate that the skin effect manifests itself as multifractality in the many-body Hilbert space. This multifractality does not accompany the single-particle skin effect and hence is intrinsic to the many-body skin effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the many-body skin effect coexists with spectral statistics of random matrices, in contrast to multifractality associated with the many-body localization, which necessitates the absence of ergodicity. We also illustrate multifractality caused by the Liouvillian skin effect in Markovian open quantum systems. Our work establishes a defining characterization of the non-Hermitian skin effect and uncovers a fundamental relationship between multifractality and ergodicity in open quantum many-body systems.

Title: The boundary disorder correlation for the Ising model on a cylinder
Authors: Rafael Leon Greenblatt
Abstract: I give an expression for the correlation function of disorder insertions on the edges of the critical Ising model on a cylinder as a function of the aspect ratio (rescaled in the case of anisotropic couplings). This is obtained from an expression for the finite size scaling term in the free energy on a cylinder in periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions in terms of Jacobi theta functions.

Title: String condensation and topological holography for 2+1D gapless SPT
Authors: Rui Wen
Abstract: The theory of anyon condensation is the foundation of the bulk-boundary relation and topological holography in 2+1D/1+1D. It is believed string condensation should replace anyon condensation in the 3+1D/2+1D topological holography theory. In this work we study string condensations in 3+1D topological orders and their relations to 2+1D phases. We find that a class of non-Lagrangian condensable algebras in 3+1D are exactly dual to a class of 2+1D symmetry enriched gapless phases known as gapless SPTs(gSPT). We show how topological properties of a gSPT can be fully extracted from the dual string condensation. We give an algebraic classification of this class of condensable algebras in 3+1D $G$-gauge theories that we call magnetic and simple. Through the topological holography dictionary, this maps to the classification of 2+1D $G$-symmetric phases with no topological order, including gapped and gapless SPTs. Utilizing the classification, we identify three classes of gSPTs and study their properties and gauging. Along the way, we reveal physical structures of string condensations.

Title: Stress Predictions in Polycrystal Plasticity using Graph Neural Networks with Subgraph Training
Authors: Hanfeng Zhai
Abstract: Numerical modeling of polycrystal plasticity is computationally intensive. We employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict stresses on complex geometries for polycrystal plasticity from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We present a novel message-passing GNN that encodes nodal strain and edge distances between FEM mesh cells, and aggregates to obtain embeddings and combines the decoded embeddings with the nodal strains to predict stress tensors on graph nodes. The GNN is trained on subgraphs generated from FEM mesh graphs, in which the mesh cells are converted to nodes and edges are created between adjacent cells. We apply the trained GNN to periodic polycrystals with complex geometries and learn the strain-stress maps based on crystal plasticity theory. The GNN is accurately trained on FEM graphs, in which the $R^2$ for both training and testing sets are larger than 0.99. The proposed GNN approach speeds up more than 150 times compared with FEM on stress predictions. We also apply the trained GNN to unseen simulations for validations and the GNN generalizes well with an overall $R^2$ of 0.992. The GNN accurately predicts the von Mises stress on polycrystals. The proposed model does not overfit and generalizes well beyond the training data, as the error distributions demonstrate. This work outlooks surrogating crystal plasticity simulations using graph data.

Title: Pressure-dependent magnetism of the Kitaev candidate Li$_2$RhO$_3$
Authors: Bin Shen, Efrain Insuasti Pazmino, Ramesh Dhakal, Friedrich Freund, Philipp Gegenwart, Stephen M. Winter, Alexander A. Tsirlin
Abstract: We use magnetization measurements under pressure along with \textit{ab initio} and cluster many-body calculations to investigate magnetism of the Kitaev candidate Li$_2$RhO$_3$. Hydrostatic compression leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic Kitaev coupling $K_1$ and the corresponding increase in the off-diagonal anisotropy $\Gamma_1$, whereas the experimental Curie-Weiss temperature changes from negative to positive with the slope of +40~K/GPa. On the other hand, spin freezing persists up to at least 3.46~GPa with the almost constant freezing temperature of 5~K that does not follow the large changes in the exchange couplings and indicates the likely extrinsic origin of spin freezing. Magnetic frustration in Li$_2$RhO$_3$ is mainly related to the interplay between ferromagnetic $K_1$ and antiferromagnetic $\Gamma_1$, along with the weakness of the third-neighbor coupling $J_3$ that would otherwise stabilize zigzag order. The small $J_3$ distinguishes Li$_2$RhO$_3$ from other Kitaev candidates.

Title: Topological chiral superconductivity beyond pairing in a Fermi liquid
Authors: Minho Kim, Abigail Timmel, Long Ju, Xiao-Gang Wen
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism to produce superconductivity by strong purely repulsive interactions for flat dispersion $\varepsilon \sim k^4$, without using pairing instability in Fermi-liquid. The resulting superconductors break both time-reversal and reflection symmetries in the orbital motion of electrons, and exhibit non-trivial topological order. Our findings suggest that this topological chiral superconductivity is more likely to emerge near or between fully spin-valley polarized metallic phase and Wigner crystal phase. These topological chiral superconductors can be fully or partially spin-valley polarized. For partial spin-valley polarization, the ratios of electron densities associated with different spin-valley quantum numbers are quantized as simple rational numbers. Furthermore, many of these topological chiral superconductors exhibit charge-4 or higher condensation, neutral quasiparticles with fractional statistics, and/or gapless chiral edge states. Two of the topological chiral superconductors are in the same phases as the ``spin''-triplet or spinless $p+ \textrm{i} p$ BCS superconductor, while others are in different phases than any BCS superconductors. The same mechanism is also used to produce anyon superconductivity between fractional anomalous quantum Hall states in the presence of a periodic potential.

Title: Electronic anisotropy and rotational symmetry breaking at a Weyl semimetal/spin ice interface
Authors: Tsung-Chi Wu, Yueqing Chang, Ang-Kun Wu, Michael Terilli, Fangdi Wen, Mikhail Kareev, Eun Sang Choi, David Graf, Qinghua Zhang, Lin Gu, Zhentao Wang, Jedediah H. Pixley, Jak Chakhalian
Abstract: In magnetic pyrochlore materials, the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, electronic correlations, and geometrical frustration gives rise to exotic quantum phases, including topological semimetals and spin ice. While these phases have been observed in isolation, the interface-driven phenomena emerging from their interaction have never been realized previously. Here, we report on the discovery of interfacial electronic anisotropy and rotational symmetry breaking at a heterostructure consisting of the Weyl semimetal Eu2Ir2O7 and spin ice Dy2Ti2O7. Subjected to magnetic fields, we unveil a six-fold anisotropic transport response that is theoretically accounted by a Kondo-coupled heterointerface, where the spin ice's field-tuned magnetism induces electron scattering in the Weyl semimetal's topological Fermi-arc states. Furthermore, at elevated magnetic fields, we reveal a two-fold anisotropic response indicative of a new symmetry-broken many-body state. This discovery showcases the nascent potential of complex quantum architectures in search of emergent phenomena unreachable in bulk crystals.

Abstract: Among interesting applications of cold atoms, quantum simulations attract a lot of attention. In this context, rare-earth ultracold atoms are particularly appealing for such simulators due to their numerous Fano-Feshbach resonances and magnetic dipole moments in the ground state. Creating a quantum gas microscope requires a large optical access that may be achieved using transport of atoms between separate vacuum volumes. We demonstrate that in case of the transport of magnetic atoms the magnetic field can be directly measured and adjusted to reduce additional losses after the transport therefore increasing the efficiency of subsequent evaporation cooling. This approach allows to transfer over 85% of the atoms from the main chamber to the scientific chamber, located 38 cm away with moderate laser power of 26 W without atomic polarization decay.

Title: Meissner effect in non-Hermitian superconductors
Authors: Shun Tamura, Helene Müller, Linus Aliani, Viktoriia Kornich
Abstract: We study theoretically Meissner effect in non-Hermitian systems of BCS type via superfluid stiffness. We show that depending on the values of the mean fields, chemical potential, and temperature, we obtain paramagnetic or diamagnetic Meissner effect. Notably, positive real part of the product of mean fields guarantees diamagnetic Meissner effect in an $s$-wave 3D non-Hermitian superconductor. Once the mean fields are close to being anti-Hermitian, 2D $s$-, $p_x$-, and $d$-wave superconductors exhibit interesting behaviour, including paramagnetic Meissner effect for certain parameters.

Title: Thermal lifetime of breathers
Authors: Juan F. R. Archilla, Jānis Bajārs, Sergej Flach
Abstract: In this article, we explore the lifetime of localized excitations in nonlinear lattices, called breathers, when a thermalized lattice is perturbed with localized energy delivered to a single site. We develop a method to measure the time it takes for the system to approach equilibrium based on a single scalar quantity, the participation number, and deduce the value corresponding to thermal equilibrium. We observe the time to achieve thermalization as a function of the energy of the excited site. We explore a variety of different physical system models. The result is that the lifetime of breathers increases exponentially with the breather energy for all the systems. This increase becomes observable when this energy is larger than approximately ten times the local average thermal energy. These results may provide a method to detect the existence of breathers in real systems.

Title: Tuning the structure and superconductivity of SrNi$_2$P$_2$ by Rh substitution
Authors: Juan Schmidt, Aashish Sapkota, Carsyn L. Mueller, Shuyang Xiao, Shuyuan Huyan, Tyler J. Slade, Seok-Wook Lee, Sergey L. Bud'ko, Paul C. Canfield
Abstract: SrNi$_2$P$_2$ is unique among the ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ class since it exhibits a temperature induced transition upon cooling from an uncollapsed tetragonal (ucT) state to a one-third-collapsed orthorhombic (tcO) state where one out of every three P-rows bond across the Sr layers. This compound is also known for exhibiting bulk superconductivity below 1.4 K at ambient pressure. In this work, we report on the effects of Rh substitution in Sr(Ni$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$)$_2$P$_2$ on the structural and superconducting properties. We studied the variation of the nearest P-P distances as a function of the Rh fraction at room temperature, as well as its temperature dependence for selected compositions. We find that increasing the Rh fraction leads to a decrease in the transition temperature between the ucT and tcO states, until a full suppression of the tcO state for $x\geq 0.166$. The superconducting transition first remains nearly insensitive to the Rh fraction, and then it increases to 2.3 K after the tcO state is fully suppressed. These results are summarized in a phase diagram, built upon the characterization by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, resistance, magnetization and specific heat measurements done on crystalline samples with varying Rh content. The relationship between band structure, crystal structure and superconductivity is discussed based on previously reported band structure calculations on SrRh$_2$P$_2$. Moreover, the effect of Rh fraction on the stress-induced structural transitions is also addressed by means of strain-stress studies done by uniaxial compression of single-crystalline micropillars of Sr(Ni$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$)$_2$P$_2$.

Title: Subwavelength Localisation in Disordered Systems
Authors: Habib Ammari, Silvio Barandun, Alexander Uhlmann
Abstract: We consider disordered finite systems of subwavelength resonators where the disorder is in the spatial arrangement of the resonators and their material parameters are perturbed randomly. We elucidate the mechanism of wave localisation in such systems. To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism, make precise the notions of bandgap and localised eigenmodes, study their stabilities with respect to fluctuations in the system, and highlight the importance of defect hybridisation and level repulsion in creating localised eigenmodes for a given arrangement of the resonators by randomly changing their material parameters. We also introduce a method of localised eigenmode prediction based on the discrete Green function of the disordered system of resonators and show the existence of hybridised bound eigenmodes in disordered systems where local translation invariance is broken.

Title: Integer Quantum Hall Effect: Disorder, temperature, floating, and plateau width
Authors: Stuart Yi-Thomas, Yi Huang, Jay D. Sau, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: We theoretically consider disorder and temperature effects on the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) using a variety of distinct and complementary analytical and numerical techniques. In particular, we address simple, physical, and experimentally relevant questions: How does disorder and/or temperature affect the IQHE plateau width? Does the plateau width increase or decrease with disorder and/or temperature? What happens to the peak in the longitudinal conductance with increasing disorder/temperature? Does the longitudinal conductance obey any universal scaling property? Is there "floating" with increasing disorder and/or decreasing magnetic field? Can disorder destroy the IQHE? Is there an IQHE to localization transition? What is the Landau level dependence of the plateau width? Our detailed theory provides answers to these and other related experimentally relevant questions. We discuss our results in the context of existing experimental results and suggest future experiments arising from our work. A key finding is that disorder and temperature are intrinsically connected in affecting IQHE, and there is an intricate interplay between them leading to nonmonotonicity in how the IQHE plateau width behaves as a function of increasing disorder. Both must be considered on an equal footing in understanding IQHE experiments.

Title: Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless region and magnetization plateaus in easy-axis triangular weak-dimer antiferromagnet K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$
Authors: Ying Fu, Han Ge, Jian Chen, Jie Xiao, Yi Tan, Le Wang, Junfeng Wang, Chao Dong, Zhe Qu, Miao He, Chuanying Xi, Langsheng Ling, Bin Xi, Jia-Wei Mei
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic phase diagram of the bilayer triangular antiferromagnet K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$, revealing a rich interplay among geometric frustration, bilayer coupling, and symmetry-driven phenomena. High-field magnetization measurements show fractional magnetization plateaus at 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, and 5/6 of the saturation magnetization. To elucidate the experimental magnetic phase diagram at low fields, we propose that K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$ can be described as an easy-axis triangular weak-dimer antiferromagnet. We emphasize the critical role of the emergent $U(1) \otimes S_3$ symmetry, where $S_3 = \mathbb{Z}_3 \otimes \mathbb{Z}_2^d$, in determining the magnetic phases at low fields. The remarkable agreement between the experimental and theoretical phase diagrams suggests that the phase transitions are governed by this symmetry. Notably, our combined experimental and theoretical results identify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase region at finite fields. These findings provide new insights into the phase structure of frustrated magnets and establish K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$ as a compelling platform for exploring unconventional quantum phenomena in $U(1) \otimes S_3$ systems.

Title: Two-dimensional ferroelectric crystal with temperature-invariant ultralow thermal conductivity
Authors: Wenjie Zhou, Shi Liu
Abstract: We report the discovery of temperature-invariant ultralow thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) in monolayer $\beta'$-In$_2$Se$_3$, a two-dimensional ferroelectric crystal with in-plane polarization. Using a combination of generalized Wigner transport equation theory and machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal that the balance between particle-like phonon propagating and wave-like tunneling transport mechanisms results in a propagating-tunneling-invariant (PTI) ultralow thermal conductivity of approximately 0.6 W/mK (comparable to that of glass) over a broad temperature range ($150<T<800$~K). This behavior stems from intrinsic strong lattice anharmonicity driven by ferroelectric dipolar fluctuations, eliminating the need for extrinsic structural modifications. In contrast, the $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$~monolayer, which shares the same stoichiometry, exhibits a conventional temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, $\kappa (T) \propto T^{-1}$, typical of simple crystals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anharmonicity in $\beta'$-In$_2$Se$_3$~can be precisely modulated by an external electric field, enabling on-demand control of thermal transport properties, including modifying the temperature scaling behavior of heat conductivity and achieving a large thermal switching ratio of $\approx$2.5. These findings provide fundamental insights into the interplay between field-tunable lattice anharmonicity, phonon dynamics, and thermal transport mechanisms.

Title: Quantum thermoelectric transmission functions with minimal current fluctuations
Authors: Andre M. Timpanaro, Giacomo Guarnieri, Gabriel T. Landi
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) represent a benchmark result in nonequilibrium physics that allows to place fundamental lower bounds on the noise-to-signal ratio (precision) of currents in nanoscale devices. Originally formulated for classical time-homogeneous Markov processes, these relations, were shown to be violated in thermoelectric engines and photovoltaic devices supporting quantum-coherent transport. However, the extent to which these violations may occur still represents a missing piece of the puzzle. In this work, we provide such answer in a definitive way within the general Landauer-Büttiker formalism for noninteracting systems, beyond any perturbative regime, e.g., linear response. In particular, using analytical constrained-optimization techniques, we rigorously demonstrate that the transmission function which maximizes the reliability of thermoelectric devices (i.e., which minimizes the fluctuations of its steady-state currents) for fixed average power and efficiency is a collection of boxcar functions. This allows us to show that TURs can be violated by arbitrarily large amounts, depending on the temperature and chemical potential gradients, thus providing guidelines to the design of optimal devices.

Title: Small polarons mediated near-room-temperature metal-insulator transition in vanadium dioxide and their hopping dynamics

Abstract: Researchers pursuing advanced photoelectric devices have discovered near room-temperature metal-insulator transitions (MIT) in non-volatile VO2. Despite theoretical investigations suggesting that polaron dynamics mediate the MIT, direct experimental evidence remains scarce. In this study, we present direct evidence of the polaron state in insulating VO2 through high-resolution spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements and first-principles calculations. We illustrate the complementary role of polaron dynamics in facilitating Peierls and Mott transitions, thereby contributing to the MIT processes. Furthermore, our observations and characterizations of conventional metallic and correlated plasmons in the respective phases of the VO2 film offer valuable insights into their electron structures. This investigation enhances comprehension of the MIT mechanism in correlated systems and underscores the roles of polarons, lattice distortions, and electron correlations in facilitating phase transition processes in strongly-correlated systems. Additionally, the detailed detection of small polarons and plasmons serves as inspiration for the development of new device functionalities.

Title: Optically and remotely controlling localization of exciton polariton condensates in a potential lattice
Authors: Qiang Ai, Jan Wingenbach, Xinmiao Yang, Jing Wei, Zaharias Hatzopoulos, Pavlos G. Savvidis, Stefan Schumacher, Xuekai Ma, Tingge Gao
Abstract: Exciton polaritons are inherently tunable systems with adjustable potential landscape. In this work we show that exciton polariton condensates can be selectively localized in a fixed optically induced periodic lattice with uniform potential depth, by judiciously controlling a second focused pump of very small size away from the lattice chain. Specifically, the localized polariton condensate can be tuned among different potential traps by adjusting the relative distance between the small pump spot and the potential lattice. The adjustment of the excitation position of the smaller pump spot and its combination with the fixed larger pump spot for the potential creation induce the mode selection determined by gain profile, group velocity, and potential distribution within the system. The localization of the exciton polariton condensate and its control are independent of the orientation of the potential lattice, thus, even in slightly disordered system, one can selectively excite such localized polariton condensates. Our results illuminate a path to the remote manipulation of exciton polariton bosonic condensates in fixed integrated photonic chips and circuits.

Title: Forecasting long-time dynamics in quantum many-body systems by dynamic mode decomposition
Authors: Ryui Kaneko, Masatoshi Imada, Yoshiyuki Kabashima, Tomi Ohtsuki
Abstract: Reliable numerical computation of quantum dynamics is a fundamental challenge when the long-ranged quantum entanglement plays essential roles as in the cases governed by quantum criticality in strongly correlated systems. Here we apply a method that utilizes reliable short-time data of physical quantities to accurately forecast long-time behavior of the strongly entangled systems. We straightforwardly employ the simple dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which is commonly used in fluid dynamics. Despite the simplicity of the method, the effectiveness and applicability of the DMD in quantum many-body systems such as the Ising model in the transverse field at the critical point are demonstrated, even when the time evolution at long time exhibits complicated features such as a volume-law entanglement entropy and consequential power-law decays of correlations characteristic of systems with long-ranged quantum entanglements unlike fluid dynamics. The present method, though simple, enables accurate forecasts amazingly at time as long as nearly an order of magnitude longer than that of the short-time training data. Effects of noise on the accuracy of the forecast are also investigated, because they are important especially when dealing with the experimental data. We find that a few percentages of noise do not affect the prediction accuracy destructively.

Title: Coalescing hardcore-boson condensate states with nonzero momentum
Authors: C. H. Zhang, Z. Song
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), as an exclusive feature of a non-Hermitian system, support coalescing states to be alternative stable state beyond the ground state. In this work, we explore the influence of non-Hermitian impurities on the dynamic formation of condensate states in one-, two-, and three-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard systems with strong on-site interaction. Based on the solution for the hardcore limit, we show exactly that condensate modes with off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) can exist when certain system parameters satisfy specific matching conditions. Under open boundary conditions, the condensate states become coalescing states when the non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric boundary gives rise to the EPs. The fundamental mechanism behind this phenomenon is uncovered through analyzing the scattering dynamics of many-particle wavepackets at the non-Hermitian boundaries. The EP dynamics facilitate the dynamic generation of condensate states with non-zero momentum. To further substantiate the theoretical findings, numerical simulations are conducted. This study not only unveils the potential condensation of interacting bosons but also offers an approach for the engineering of condensate states.

Title: Spin coupling is all you need: Encoding strong electron correlation in molecules on quantum computers
Authors: Daniel Marti-Dafcik, Hugh G. A. Burton, David P. Tew
Abstract: The performance of quantum algorithms for eigenvalue problems, such as computing Hamiltonian spectra, depends strongly on the overlap of the initial wavefunction and the target eigenvector. In a basis of Slater determinants, the representation of energy eigenstates of systems with $N$ strongly correlated electrons requires a number of determinants that scales exponentially with $N$. On classical processors, this restricts simulations to systems where $N$ is small. Here, we show that quantum computers can efficiently simulate strongly correlated molecular systems by directly encoding the dominant entanglement structure in the form of spin-coupled initial states. This avoids resorting to expensive classical or quantum state preparation heuristics and instead exploits symmetries in the wavefunction. We provide quantum circuits for deterministic preparation of a family of spin eigenfunctions with ${N \choose N/2}$ Slater determinants with depth $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ local gates. Their use as highly entangled initial states in quantum algorithms reduces the total runtime of quantum phase estimation and related fault-tolerant methods by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we assess the application of spin-coupled wavefunctions as initial states for several heuristic quantum algorithms, namely the variational quantum eigensolver, adiabatic state preparation, and different versions of quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) including QSD based on real-time-evolved states. We also propose a novel QSD algorithm that exploits states obtained through adaptive quantum eigensolvers. For all algorithms, we demonstrate that using spin-coupled initial states drastically reduces the quantum resources required to simulate strongly correlated ground and excited states. Our work provides a crucial component for enabling scalable quantum simulation of classically challenging electronic systems.

Abstract: This review article presents historical developments and recent advances in our understanding on the three-body forces and Efimov physics, from an interdisciplinary viewpoint encompassing nuclear physics and cold atoms. Theoretical attempts to elucidate the three-body force with the chiral effective field theory are explained, followed by an overview of experiments aimed at observing signatures of the nuclear three-body force. Some recent experimental and theoretical works in the field of cold atoms devoted to measuring and engineering three-body forces among atoms are also presented. As a phenomenon arising from the three-body effect, Efimov physics in both cold atoms and nuclear systems is reviewed.

Title: Krylov Subspace Methods for Quantum Dynamics with Time-Dependent Generators
Authors: Kazutaka Takahashi, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: Krylov subspace methods in quantum dynamics identify the minimal subspace in which a process unfolds. To date, their use is restricted to time evolutions governed by time-independent generators. We introduce a generalization valid for driven quantum systems governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that maps the evolution to a diffusion problem in a one-dimensional lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping probabilities that are inhomogeneous and time dependent. This representation is used to establish a novel class of fundamental limits to the quantum speed of evolution and operator growth. We also discuss generalizations of the algorithm, adapted to discretized time evolutions and periodic Hamiltonians, with applications to many-body systems.

Title: Exploring Intrinsic Bond Orbitals in Solids
Authors: Benjamin Wöckinger, Alexander Rumpf, Tobias Schäfer
Abstract: We present a study of the construction and spatial properties of localized Wannier orbitals in large supercells of insulating solids using plane waves as the underlying basis. The Pipek-Mezey (PM) functional in combination with intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAOs) as projectors is employed, resulting in so-called intrinsic bond orbitals (IBOs). Independent of the bonding type and band gap, a correlation between orbital spreads and geometric properties is observed. As a result, comparable sparsity patterns of the Hartree-Fock exchange matrix are found across all considered bulk 3D materials, exhibiting covalent bonds, ionc bonds, and a mixture of both bonding types. Recognizing the considerable computational effort required to construct localized Wannier orbitals for large periodic simulation cells, we address the performance and scaling of different solvers for the localization problem. This includes the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), Conjugate-Gradient (CG), Steepest Ascent (SA) as well as the Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) method. Each algorithm performs a Riemannian optimization under unitary matrix constraint, efficiently reaching the optimum in the "curved parameter space" on geodesics. We hereby complement the literature with an introduction to this topic along with key references. Furthermore, we observe that the construction of Wannier orbitals for supercells of metal oxides presents a significant challenge, requiring approximately one order of magnitude more iteration steps than other systems studied.

Title: A multi-detector neutral helium atom microscope
Authors: Chenyang Zhao, Sam M Lambrick, Nick A von Jeinsen, Yanke Yuan, Xiaolong Zhang, Aleksandar Radić, David J Ward, John Ellis, Andrew P Jardine
Abstract: Scanning helium microscopy (SHeM) is an emerging technique that uses a beam of neutral atoms to image and analyse surfaces. The low energies ($\sim$64 meV) and completely non-destructive nature of the probe particles provide exceptional sensitivity for studying delicate samples and thin devices, including 2D materials. To date, around five such instruments have been constructed and are described in the literature. All represent the first attempts at SHeM construction in different laboratories, and use a single detection device. Here, we describe our second generation microscope, which is the first to offer multi-detector capabilities. The new instrument builds on recent research into SHeM optimisation and incorporates many improved design features over our previous instrument. We present measurements that highlight some of the unique capabilities the instrument provides, including 3D surface profiling, alternative imaging modes, and simultaneous acquisition of images from a mixed species beam.

Title: Inverse Spin Thermal Hall Effect in Non-Reciprocal Photonic Systems
Authors: Philippe Ben-Abdallah
Abstract: A transverse radiative heat flux induced by the gradient of spin angular momentum of photons in non-reciprocal systems is predicted. This thermal analog of the inverse spin Hall effect is analyzed in magneto-optical networks exhibiting C4 symmetry, under the action of spatially variable external magnetic fields. This finding opens new avenues for thermal management and energy conversion with non-reciprocal systems through a localized and dynamic control of the spin angular momentum of light.

Title: Suppressing chaos with mixed superconducting qubit devices
Authors: Ben Blain, Giampiero Marchegiani, Luigi Amico, Gianluigi Catelani
Abstract: In quantum information processing, a tension between two different tasks occurs: while qubits' states can be preserved by isolating them, quantum gates can be realized only through qubit-qubit interactions. In arrays of qubits, weak coupling leads to states being spatially localized and strong coupling to delocalized states. Here, we study the average energy level spacing and the relative entropy of the distribution of the level spacings (Kullback-Leibler divergence from Poisson and Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble) to analyze the crossover between localized and delocalized (chaotic) regimes in linear arrays of superconducting qubits. We consider both transmons as well as capacitively shunted flux qubits, which enables us to tune the qubit anharmonicity. Arrays with uniform anharmonicity, comprising only transmons or flux qubits, display remarkably similar dependencies of level statistics on the coupling strength. In systems with alternating anharmonicity, the localized regime is found to be more resilient to the increase in qubit-qubit coupling strength in comparison to arrays with a single qubit type. This result supports designing devices that incorporate different qubit types to achieve higher performances.

Title: Wrinkling and imaging of thin curved sheets
Authors: Megha Emerse, Lucas Goehring
Abstract: Thin films or sheets subjected to external forces often undergo mechanical instability, leading to regular patterns of wrinkles, folds, and creases. As can be anticipated from the difficulty of flattening a curved globe, any natural curvature of the sheet will have a strong influence on these instabilities. Here, we develop a non-invasive synthetic schlieren imaging technique to image and reconstruct the surface of wrinkling curved sheets, confined to float on water. Our method circumvents the small-amplitude limit of related imaging techniques, and we demonstrate robust means to estimate the reconstruction accuracy. We then evaluate how the sign and magnitude of Gaussian curvature affects the wrinkling of thin curved sheets, and compare observations of the wrinkle wavelength, amplitude and domain structure with recent theoretical predictions. While generally validating model predictions, we find that the assumption of a conserved surface area during wrinkling should be treated with some care. The control of wrinkling behavior demonstrated here can have application in the design of liquid lenses, microfluidics, active textured surfaces, and flexible electronic components.
