Title: Folded State Dynamics -- A Geometric and Deterministic Origin of Irreversibility
Authors: Patrick BarAvi
Abstract: The emergence of irreversibility in isolated, deterministic systems remains a central challenge in statistical mechanics. Traditional approaches, such as Boltzmann's H-theorem and Lanford's derivation of the Boltzmann equation, rely on probabilistic assumptions and are limited to dilute gases and short timescales. We introduce Folded State Dynamics (FSD), a framework in which irreversibility arises from the geometric structure of phase space in systems with coupled rotational and translational degrees of freedom. In contrast to conventional models with unfolded, weakly coupled modes, FSD exhibits phase space folding, where deterministic coupling induces instability and chaotic mixing. We show that equilibrium states exponentially dominate the accessible phase space volume, while constrained configurations (e.g., pure rotation) occupy measure-zero subsets. This yields a geometric derivation of entropy growth, with reversal probabilities suppressed as Prev and recurrence times Trec, resolving Loschmidt's and Zermelo's objections without coarse-graining or fine-tuning. FSD is further extended to include charged systems (cFSD), where electromagnetic interactions continuously drive phase space folding. FSD thus offers a deterministic and testable mechanism for irreversibility, with implications ranging from confined colloids to the cosmological arrow of time

Title: Quantum Hall Effect without Chern Bands
Authors: Benjamin Michen, Jan Carl Budich
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect was originally observed in a two-dimensional electron gas forming Landau levels when exposed to a strong perpendicular magnetic field, and has later been generalized to Chern insulators without net magnetization. Here, further extending the realm of the quantum Hall effect, we report on the robust occurrence of an integer quantized transverse conductance at the onset of disorder in a microscopic lattice model all bands of which are topologically trivial (zero Chern number). We attribute this remarkable phenomenon to the energetic separation of substantial but non-quantized Berry fluxes within the topologically trivial bands. Adding a random disorder potential then nudges the system into a stable quantum Hall phase from an extended critical regime of the clean system obtained by placing the Fermi energy within a broad window in either of the trivial bands. Our results are corroborated by extensive numerical transport simulations as well as the analysis of several complementary topological markers.

Title: Euler topology in classical spin liquids
Authors: Luca Rüegg, Arthur Morris, Han Yan, Robert-Jan Slager
Abstract: Classical spin liquids have recently been analyzed in view of the single-gap homotopy classification of their dispersive eigenvectors. We show that the recent progress in defining multi-gap topologies, notably exemplified by the Euler class, can be naturally included in these homotopy-based classification schemes and present phases that change topology by band node braiding. This process alters the topology of the pinch points in the spin structure factor and consequently their stability. Furthermore, we discuss how these notions also pertain to models discussed previously in the literature and have a broader range of application beyond our specific results. Our work thus opens up an uncharted avenue in the understanding of spin liquids.

Title: Full, three-quarter, half and quarter Wigner crystals in Bernal bilayer graphene
Authors: Enrique Aguilar-Méndez, Titus Neupert, Glenn Wagner
Abstract: Application of a displacement field opens a gap and enhances the Van-Hove singularities in the band structure of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. By adjusting the carrier density so that the Fermi energy lies in the vicinity of these singularities, recent experiments observe a plethora of highly correlated electronic phases including isospin polarized phases and high-resistance states with non-linear electric transport indicative of a possible Wigner crystal. We perform Hartree-Fock calculations incorporating long-range Coulomb interactions and allowing for translational and rotational symmetry breaking. We obtain the displacement field vs. carrier density phase diagram which shows isospin polarized metallic phases tracking the Van-Hove singularity in the valence band. Between these metallic phases we observe regions where the ground state is a Wigner crystal. The isospin polarization of the Wigner crystals tracks the isospin polarization of the nearby metallic phases. Depending on whether we have four, three, two or one isospin flavours, we obtain a full, three-quarter, half or quarter Wigner crystal.

Title: Stable Real-Space Invariants and Topology Beyond Symmetry Indicators
Authors: Yoonseok Hwang, Vaibhav Gupta, Frank Schindler, Luis Elcoro, Zhida Song, B. Andrei Bernevig, Barry Bradlyn
Abstract: We show that certain band gaps, which appear topologically trivial from the perspective of symmetry indicators (SIs), must instead be topological, as guaranteed by real-space information that follows from Topological Quantum Chemistry (TQC). To address this, we introduce stable real-space invariants (SRSIs) that generalize the previously discovered local and composite real-space invariants to global topological invariants of a given set of bands. These are linear combinations of Wannier state multiplicities at Wyckoff positions and take the form of $\mathbb{Z}$- and $\mathbb{Z}_n$-valued quantities ($n=2,4$). We enumerate all $\mathbb{Z}$SRSIs and $\mathbb{Z}_n$SRSIs in all non-magnetic space groups (SGs) with and without spin-orbit coupling. SRSIs fully diagnose the stable equivalence of atomic insulators, ensuring that two atomic insulators with matching SRSIs are adiabatically deformable to one another in the presence of auxiliary trivial bands. For both atomic and topological bands, $\mathbb{Z}$SRSIs are determined by the momentum-space symmetry data and thus determine the SIs. $\mathbb{Z}_n$SRSIs provide additional information about trivial band structures not captured by momentum-space data. While split elementary band representations (EBRs), where the bands forming an EBR split into disconnected parts, must induce band topology, there are 211 cases across 51 SGs where the momentum-space data of an EBR decomposes linearly with positive integer coefficients into those of other EBRs. We demonstrate that $\mathbb{Z}_n$SRSIs successfully identify the band topology in the majority of these split EBR cases, diagnosing all but 8 cases in 5 SGs. Our results solidify the conceptual framework of TQC as containing, but going beyond, SIs and momentum-space symmetry data.

Title: Towards Atomic-Scale Control over Structural Modulations in Quasi-1D Chalcogenides for Colossal Optical Anisotropy
Authors: Guodong Ren, Shantanu Singh, Gwan Yeong Jung, Wooseon Choi, Huandong Chen, Boyang Zhao, Kevin Ye, Andrew R. Lupini, Miaofang Chi, Jordan A. Hachtel, Young-Min Kim, Jayakanth Ravichandran, Rohan Mishra
Abstract: Optically anisotropic materials are sought after for tailoring the polarization of light. Recently, colossal optical anisotropy was reported in a quasi-one-dimensional chalcogenide, Sr1.125TiS3. Compared to SrTiS3, the excess Sr in Sr1.125TiS3 leads to periodic structural modulations and introduces additional electrons that undergo charge ordering on select Ti atoms to form a highly polarizable cloud oriented along the c-axis, hence, resulting in the colossolal optical anisotropy. Here, further enhancement of the colossal optical anisotropy to 2.5 in Sr1.143TiS3 is reported through control over the periodicity of the atomic-scale modulations. The role of structural modulations in tuning the optical properties in a series of SrxTiS3 compounds has been investigated using DFT calculations. The structural modulations arise from various stacking sequences of face-sharing TiS6 octahedra and twist-distorted trigonal prisms, and are found to be thermodynamically stable for x larger than 1 but smaller than 1.5. As x increases, an indirect-to-direct band gap transition is predicted for x equal to and larger than 1.143 along with an increased occupancy of Ti-dz2 states. Together, these two factors result in a theoretically predicted maximum birefriengence of 2.5 for Sr1.143TiS3. Single crystals of Sr1.143TiS3 were grown using a molten-salt flux method. Atomic-scale observations using scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm the feasibility of synthesizing SrxTiS3 with varied modulation periodicities. Overall, these findings demonstrate compositonal tunability of optical properties in SrxTiS3 compounds, and potentially in other hexagonal perovskites having structural modulations.

Title: Role of structural biaxiality on the phase behaviour of chiral liquid crystals
Authors: Sayantan Mondal, Jayashree Saha
Abstract: We report a computer simulation study on the effect of molecular structural biaxiality in the phase formation of chiral molecules. In this study, we have done coarse-grained modeling to observe self-assembled phase behavior. In our molecular dynamics simulation study we varied both the chiral interaction strength and molecular biaxiality. Uniaxial molecules give rise to cholesteric phase, blue phase whereas molecular biaxiality favours cholesteric phase. At higher chirality, small chiral domains are formed creating twisted cylindrical networks with each cylinder having elliptical cross-sections instead of circular nature as found in uniaxial systems. The value of cholesteric pitch decreases when chirality and molecular biaxiality becomes higher. Coaction of biaxiality and chirality is crucial for fabricating liquid crystal materials with optical properties suitable for displays, sensors and chiral photonic devices.

Title: Geometric Origin of Phonon Magnetic Moment in Dirac Materials
Authors: Wenqin Chen, Xiao-Wei Zhang, Ting Cao, Shi-Zeng Lin, Di Xiao
Abstract: We develop a theory for the phonon magnetic moment in doped Dirac materials, treating phonons as emergent gauge and gravitational fields coupled to Dirac fermions in curved space. By classifying electron-phonon coupling into angular momentum channels of Fermi surface deformation, we show that the phonon moment arises from two mechanisms: proportional to the electron Hall conductivity through the emergent gauge field coupling, and to the Hall viscosity through the frame field coupling. Applying our theory to Cd$_3$As$_2$ with first-principles calculations, we find quantitative agreement with experiment. Our results reveal a general mechanism for dynamically generating large phonon magnetism in metals and suggest a new route for probing Hall viscosity via phonon dynamics.

Title: A Mobile Impurity in the Kitaev Chain: Phase Diagram and Signatures of Topology
Authors: A.V. Sadovnikov, M.S. Bahovadinov, A.N. Rubtsov, A.A. Markov
Abstract: We study the physics of a mobile impurity immersed in a $1d$ topological superconductor. We discuss the system's phase diagram obtained with exact diagonalization. We argue that the character of the transition from a weak to strong coupling regime depends on the phase of the host superconductor. A smooth crossover between a weakly coupled polaron and a molecular state is observed in the topological phase. In contrast, the impurity undergoes a sharp phase transition in a topologically trivial background.

Title: Extrinsic contribution to bosonic thermal Hall transport
Authors: Léo Mangeolle, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: Bosonic excitations like phonons and magnons dominate the low-temperature transport of magnetic insulators. Similar to electronic Hall responses, the thermal Hall effect (THE) of charge neutral bosons has been proposed as a powerful tool for probing topological properties of their wavefunctions. For example, the intrinsic contribution of the THE of a perfectly clean system is directly governed by the distribution of Berry curvature, and many experiments on topological magnon and phonon insulators have been interpreted in this way. However, disorder is inevitably present in any material and its contribution to the THE has remained poorly understood. Here we develop a rigorous kinetic theory of the extrinsic side-jump contribution to the THE of bosons. We show that the extrinsic THE can be of the same order as the intrinsic one but sensitively depends on the type of local imperfection. We study different types of impurities and show that a THE can even arise as a pure impurity-induced effect in a system with a vanishing intrinsic contribution. As a side product, we also generalize existing results for the electronic AHE to general types of impurities beyond the standard assumption of local potential scattering. We discuss the importance of our results for the correct interpretation of THE measurements.

Title: Brownian Dynamics Simulations of Inclusions in an Active Fluid Bath
Authors: Lijie Ding, Robert A. Pelcovits, Thomas R. Powers
Abstract: We carry out two-dimensional Brownian dynamics simulations of the behavior of rigid inclusion particles immersed in an active fluid bath. The active fluid is modeled as a collection of self-propelled circular disks interacting via a soft repulsive potential and a nematic alignment interaction. The fluid is characterized by its nematic order, polar order and orientational correlation length. The active fluid bath transitions from the isotropic to the nematic phase with increasing number density, increasing nematic interaction strength or increasing Péclet number. The inclusion particles are modeled as rigid assemblies of passive circular disks. Four types of inclusions are considered: a rod-like $I$ shape, a boomerang-like $L$ shape, and stair-like shapes $Z$ and $Z^*$, with opposite handedness. When inclusions are introduced into the active fluid bath, their diffusion is significantly enhanced by the force and torque exerted by the active fluid particles and the chiral inclusion particles exhibit constant rotational drift. These diffusion and rotation enhancements increase as the swimming speed of the active fluid particles increases. The translational motion of the inclusion particles also couples with their orientational motion, and the correlation is modulated by the active fluid particles' swimming speed. This work paves the way for future simulations of inclusions in active fluid baths and suggests potential avenues for controlling transport properties in active materials.

Title: Tunable and Persistent Polarization in Centrosymmetric Oxides
Authors: D.-S. Park, N. Pryds, N. Gauquelin, M. Hadad, D. Chezganov, A. Palliotto, D. Jannis, J. Íñiguez-González, J. Verbeeck, P. Muralt, D. Damjanovic
Abstract: Introducing symmetry breaking in materials enables the emergence of functionalities. This can be microscopically and macroscopically driven by applying external stimuli such as mechanical stress, electric field, temperature, and chemical modification. For instance, non-zero net dipole moments are formed in a material with the presence of local charged defects or their clusters, which can alter the crystal structure, charge states, and electrostatic potential across the material. Here, we demonstrate a conceptual approach to defects-mediated symmetry breaking that allows for built-in polarization in a centrosymmetric oxide, $\mathrm{Gd}_x\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x}\mathrm{O}_{2-\delta}$ (CGO) films, via creating a macroscopic charge asymmetry. Our results show that switchable and enduring polarization in CGO films is governed by the redistribution of oxygen vacancies. This leads to notable and persistent pyroelectric effects with coefficient of approximately 180 $\mu\mathrm{C}\cdot\mathrm{m}^{-2}\cdot\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. Our findings highlight the potential to develop high-performance, sustainable, environmentally friendly polar film materials by manipulating ionic defects from their centrosymmetric ground states. This approach provides new opportunities to expand polar materials in current and future energy and electronic applications.

Title: Emergent chirality and enantiomeric selectivity in layered NbOX$_2$ crystals
Authors: Martin Gutierrez-Amigo, Claudia Felser, Ion Errea, Maia G. Vergniory
Abstract: The spontaneous emergence of chirality in crystalline solids has profound implications for electronic, optical, and topological properties, making the control of chiral phases a central challenge in materials design. Here, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of a new family of layered compounds, $\mathrm{NbOX_2}$, and explore the connection between their achiral $I m m m$ phase and chiral $C 2$ phase. Through first-principles calculations, we identify an intermediate achiral $C 2/m$ phase that bridges the high- and low-symmetry phases within a three-dimensional order parameter space. The insulating $C 2$ phase exhibits unique electronic properties, including flat Niobium $d$-orbital bands near the Fermi level associated with an obstructed atomic limit (OAL), hosting topologically non-trivial surface states under specific cleavage conditions. By analyzing the Born-Oppenheimer energy surfaces (BOES), we find that the shallow energy minima of the $C 2$ phase suggest that the intermediate $C 2/m$ phase may be stabilized either by ionic quantum or thermal fluctuations, and the consequent lattice anharmonicity, or by external factors such as pressure. Additionally, we show how an external electric field, by breaking the necessary symmetries, biases the system toward a preferred chirality by lifting the energy degeneracy between the two enantiomers. This, combined with the small energy barrier between the enantiomers in the $C 2$ phase, enables handedness control and allows us to propose a mechanism for selective handedness stabilization by leveraging electric fields and temperature-dependent anharmonic effects. Our findings establish a framework for understanding chirality emergence in layered materials and offer a pathway for designing systems with tunable enantiomeric populations.

Title: Charge density waves and soft phonon evolution in the superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$
Authors: Tom Lacmann, Sofia-Michaela Souliou, Fabian Henssler, Mehdi Frachet, Philippa Helen McGuinness, Michael Merz, Björn Wehinger, Daniel A. Chaney, Amir-Abbas Haghighirad, Rolf Heid, Matthieu Le Tacon
Abstract: The superconductor BaNi$_2$As$_2$ exhibits a soft-phonon-driven, incommensurate charge density wave (I-CDW) which is accompanied by a small orthorhombic structural phase transition. Upon further cooling, BaNi$_2$As$_2$ undergoes a first-order structural transition to a triclinic phase in which a commensurate CDW (C-CDW) appears. The relationship and interplay between the I-CDW, C-CDW and structural phase transitions has remained elusive. To investigate this issue, we present a complementary study of thermal diffuse X-Ray scattering and inelastic X-Ray scattering for phosphorus substituted BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ $(x\lessapprox0.12)$ and down to 2.2 K. We show that most of the diffuse scattering signal can be well described by first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. Furthermore, we find that although phosphorus substitution rapidly suppresses the structural transition temperatures, the temperature dependence of the correlation length of the I-CDW fluctuations and the formation of Bragg-like superstructure peaks associated with long-range ordering of this order depends only weakly on the substitution level. Finally, we present the absence of signatures of the I-CDW to C-CDW or triclinic transition in the lattice dynamics, indicating that these instabilities are not (soft) phonon driven.

Title: Reduction of fully screened magnetoplasmons in a laterally confined anisotropic two-dimensional electron system to an isotropic one
Authors: D. A. Rodionov, I. V. Zagorodnev
Abstract: We investigate the properties of natural two-dimensional (2D) magnetoplasma modes in laterally confined electron systems, such as 2D materials, quantum wells, or inversion layers in semiconductors, with an elliptic Fermi surface. The conductivity of the system is considered in a dynamical anisotropic Drude model. The problem is solved in the fully screened limit, i.e., under the assumption that the distance between the two-dimensional electron system and the nearby metal gate is small compared to all other lengths in the system, including the wavelength of plasmons. Remarkably, in this limit plasma oscillations in an anisotropic 2D confined system are equivalent to plasma oscillations in an isotropic 2D electron system obtained by some stretching, even when the electromagnetic retardation is taken into account. Moreover, accounting for electromagnetic retardation leads only to a renormalization of the effective masses of carriers, somewhat like in relativity. As an example, we reduce the equations describing plasmons in a gated disk with an anisotropic two-dimensional electron gas to the equations describing oscillations in an isotropic ellipse. Without a magnetic field, we solve them analytically and find eigenfrequencies. To find a solution in a magnetic field, we expand the current of plasma oscillations in the complete set of Mathieu functions. Leaving the leading terms of the expansion, we approximately find and analyze magnetodispersion for the lowest modes.

Abstract: Geometrically frustrated lattices can display a range of correlated phenomena, ranging from spin frustration and charge order to dispersionless flat bands due to quantum interference. One particularly compelling family of such materials is the half-valence spinel Li$B_2$O$_4$ materials. On the $B$-site frustrated pyrochlore sublattice, the interplay of correlated metallic behavior and charge frustration leads to a superconducting state in LiTi$_2$O$_4$ and heavy fermion behavior in LiV$_2$O$_4$. To date, however, LiTi$_2$O$_4$ has primarily been understood as a conventional BCS superconductor despite a lattice structure that could host more exotic groundstates. Here, we present a multimodal investigation of LiTi$_2$O$_4$, combining ARPES, RIXS, proximate magnetic probes, and ab-initio many-body theoretical calculations. Our data reveals a novel mobile polaronic ground state with spectroscopic signatures that underlie co-dominant electron-phonon coupling and electron-electron correlations also found in the lightly doped cuprates. The cooperation between the two interaction scales distinguishes LiTi$_2$O$_4$ from other superconducting titanates, suggesting an unconventional origin to superconductivity in LiTi$_2$O$_4$. Our work deepens our understanding of the rare interplay of electron-electron correlations and electron-phonon coupling in unconventional superconducting systems. In particular, our work identifies the geometrically frustrated, mixed-valence spinel family as an under-explored platform for discovering unconventional, correlated ground states.

Title: Lean CNNs for mapping electron charge density fields to material properties
Authors: Pranoy Ray, Kamal Choudhury, Surya R. Kalidindi
Abstract: This work introduces a lean CNN (convolutional neural network) framework, with a drastically reduced number of fittable parameters (<81K) compared to the benchmarks in current literature, to capture the underlying low-computational cost (i.e., surrogate) relationships between the electron charge density (ECD) fields and their associated effective properties. These lean CNNs are made possible by adding a pre-processing step (i.e., a feature engineering step) that involves the computation of the ECD fields' spatial correlations (specifically, 2-point spatial correlations). The viability and benefits of the proposed lean CNN framework are demonstrated by establishing robust structure-property relationships involving the prediction of effective material properties using the feature-engineered ECD fields as the only input. The framework is evaluated on a dataset of crystalline cubic systems consisting of 1410 molecular structures spanning 62 different elemental species and 3 space groups.

Title: Strain-Gradient and Curvature-Induced Changes in Domain Morphology of BaTiO3 Nanorods: Experimental and Theoretical Studies
Authors: Olha A. Kovalenko, Eugene A. Eliseev, Yuriy O. Zagorodniy, Srečo Davor Škapin, Marjeta Maček Kržmanc, Lesya Demchenko, Valentyn V. Laguta, Zdravko Kutnjak, Dean R. Evans, Anna N. Morozovska
Abstract: We investigate the impact of OH- ions incorporation on the lattice strain and spontaneous polarization of BaTiO3 nanorods synthesized under different conditions. It was confirmed that the lattice strain depends directly on Ba supersaturation, with higher supersaturation leading to an increase in the lattice strain. However, it was shown that crystal growth and observed lattice distortion are not primarily influenced by external strain; rather, OH- ions incorporation plays a key role in generating internal chemical strains and driving these processes. By using the less reactive TiO2 precursor instead of TiOCl2 and controlling Ba supersaturation, the slower nucleation rate enables more effective regulation of OH- ions incorporation and crystal growth. This in turn effects both particle size and lattice distortion, leading to c/a ratio of 1.013 - 1.014. The incorporation of OH- ions induces lattice elongation along the c-axis, contributing to anisotropic growth, increasing of the rod diameter and their growth-induced bending. However, the possibility of the curvature-induced changes in domain morphology of BaTiO3 nanorods remains almost unexplored. To study the possibility, we perform analytical calculations and finite element modeling, which provide insights into the curvature-induced changes in the strain-gradient, polarization distribution, and domain morphology in BaTiO3 nanorods. Theoretical results reveal the appearance of the domain stripes in BaTiO3 nanorod when the curvature exceeds a critical angle. The physical origin of the domain stripes emergence is the tendency to minimize its elastic energy of the nanorod by the domain splitting. These findings suggest that BaTiO3 nanorods, with curvature-controllable amount of domain stripes, could serve as flexible race-track memory elements for flexo-tronics and domain-wall electronics.

Title: Deep-Learning Atomistic Pseudopotential Model for Nanomaterials
Authors: Kailai Lin, Matthew J. Coley-O'Rourke, Eran Rabani
Abstract: The semi-empirical pseudopotential method (SEPM) has been widely applied to provide computational insights into the electronic structure, photophysics, and charge carrier dynamics of nanoscale materials. We present "DeepPseudopot", a machine-learned atomistic pseudopotential model that extends the SEPM framework by combining a flexible neural network representation of the local pseudopotential with parameterized non-local and spin-orbit coupling terms. Trained on bulk quasiparticle band structures and deformation potentials from GW calculations, the model captures many-body and relativistic effects with very high accuracy across diverse semiconducting materials, as illustrated for silicon and group III-V semiconductors. DeepPseudopot's accuracy, efficiency, and transferability make it well-suited for data-driven in silico design and discovery of novel optoelectronic nanomaterials.

Title: A Framework for Identifying Non-van der Waals 2D Materials
Authors: Shota Ono
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are categorized into van der Waals (vdW) and non-vdW types. However, no relevant descriptors have been proposed for identifying the latter. Here, we identify the non-vdW 2D materials by calculating the thickness-dependence of total energy of thin films truncated from surfaces. The non-vdW 2D materials exhibit a deviation from the law of exfoliation energy inverse to the number of layers in the monolayer limit. This framework is applied to explore single- and multi-component systems, which predicts the synthesizability of several non-vdW 2D materials including silicene and goldene that are overlooked in the dimensional analysis of the parent crystals and also predicts that a Janus structure exists in nature but is hidden in 3D crystals.

Title: Strain-induced gyrotropic effects in ferroelectric BaTiS3
Authors: Wei Luo, Asier Zabalo, Guodong Ren, Gwan-Yeong Jung, Massimiliano Stengel, Rohan Mishra, Jayakanth Ravichandran, Laurent Bellaiche
Abstract: Gyrotropic effects, including natural optical activity (NOA) and the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect (NAHE), are crucial for advancing optical and transport devices. We explore these effects in the BaTiS3 system, a quasi-one-dimensional crystal that exhibits giant optical anisotropy. (Niu et al. Nat. Photonics 12, 392 (2018); Zhao et al. Chem. Mater. 34, 5680 (2022)). In the P63cm phase which is stable under room temperature, we predict two distinct strain-induced phase transitions: a symmetry-lowering transition from the P63cm to P63 phase under tensile strain, which enhances NOA and enables optical rotation; and an isostructural insulator-to-polar Weyl semimetal (WSM) transition under compressive strain, which activates the NAHE and exhibits a strain-induced sign reversal. The low-temperature P21 phase also transforms into a P212121 phase under enough compressive strains with such phase transition exhibiting a large NOA. All these results highlight BaTiS3 as a viable candidate for novel ferroelectrics, optical and transport devices with strain enhanced or activated gyrotropic properties.

Title: Gapless spinon excitations emerging from a multipolar transverse field in the triangular-lattice Ising antiferromagnet NaTmSe2
Authors: Zheng Zhang, Jinlong Jiao, Weizhen Zhuo, Mingtai Xie, D.T.Adroja, Toni Shiroka, Guochu Deng, Anmin Zhang, Feng Jin, Jianting Ji, Jie Ma, Qingming Zhang
Abstract: The triangular-lattice quantum Ising antiferromagnet is a promising platform for realizing Anderson's quantum spin liquid, though finding suitable materials to realize it remains a challenge. Here, we present a comprehensive study of NaTmSe2 using magnetization, specific heat, neutron scattering, and muon spin relaxation, combined with theoretical calculations. We demonstrate that NaTmSe2 realizes the transverse field Ising model and quantitatively determine its exchange parameters. Our results reveal a multipolar spin-polarized state coexisting with a dipolar spin-disordered state. These states feature gapless spinon excitations mediated by the multipolar moments. The study shows how multiple types of magnetism can emerge in distinct magnetic channels (dipolar and multipolar) within a single magnet, advancing our understanding of spin-frustrated Ising physics and opening pathways for different quantum computing applications.

Title: Complex electronic topography and magnetotransport in an in-plane ferromagnetic kagome metal

Abstract: The intricate interplay between flat bands, Dirac cones, and magnetism in kagome materials has recently attracted significant attention from materials scientists, particularly in compounds belonging to the RMn6Sn6 family (R = Sc, Y, rare earths), due to their inherent magnetic frustration. Here, we present a detailed investigation of the ferromagnetic (FM) kagome magnet ScMn6(Sn0.78Ga0.22)6 using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), magnetotransport measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our findings reveal a paramagnetic-to-FM transition at 375 K, with the in-plane direction serving as the easy magnetization axis. Notably, ARPES measurements reveal a Dirac cone near the Fermi energy, while the Hall resistivity exhibits a substantial contribution from the anomalous Hall effect. Additionally, we observe a flat band spanning a substantial portion of the Brillouin zone, arising from the destructive interference of wave functions in the Mn kagome lattice. Theoretical calculations reveal that the gap in the Dirac cone can be modulated by altering the orientation of the magnetic moment. An out-of-plane orientation produces a gap of approximately 15 meV, while an in-plane alignment leads to a gapless state, as corroborated by ARPES measurements. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the electronic structure of magnetic kagome materials and paves the way for exploring novel topological phases in this material class.

Title: Resonant and Anti-resonant Exciton-Phonon Coupling in Quantum Dot Molecules

Abstract: Optically active quantum dot molecules (QDMs) can host multi-spin quantum states with the potential for the deterministic generation of photonic graph states with tailored entanglement structures. Their usefulness for the generation of such non-classical states of light is determined by orbital and spin decoherence mechanisms, particularly phonon-mediated processes dominant at energy scales up to a few millielectronvolts. Here, we directly measure the spectral function of orbital phonon relaxation in a QDM and benchmark our findings against microscopic kp theory. Our results reveal phonon-mediated relaxation rates exhibiting pronounced resonances and anti-resonances, with rates ranging from several ten ns$^{-1}$ to tens of $\mu$s$^{-1}$. Comparison with a kinetic model reveals the voltage (energy) dependent phonon coupling strength and fully explains the interplay between phonon-assisted relaxation and radiative recombination. These anti-resonances can be leveraged to increase the lifetime of energetically unfavorable charge configurations needed for realizing efficient spin-photon interfaces and multi-dimensional cluster states.

Title: Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems: II. Pseudogap Phase in the Weakly Attractive Hubbard Model
Authors: Takafumi Kita
Abstract: The hidden Bose-Einstein singularities of correlated electron systems, whose possible existence has been pointed out in a previous paper based on quantum field theory of ordered phases [T. Kita, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 93}, 124704 (2024)], are studied in more detail in terms of the attractive Hubbard model, for which the mean-field theory predicts that spin-singlet superconductivity is realized at low enough temperatures for any band structure and interaction strength. It is shown that incorporating correlation effects should change the mean-field superconducting solution substantially and qualitatively even in the weak coupling, implying that the system lies in the strong-coupling region perturbatively. The hidden singularity is found to be present around the mean-field superconducting temperature $T_{{\rm c}0}$, below which the standard self-consistent treatment by quantum field theory cannot be used due to divergences in the zero Matsubara frequency branch obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. Our method to recover the applicability with a Lagrange multiplier predicts that the singularity is a physical entity signaling the threshold of a pseudogap phase with a characteristic V-shape structure in the density of states near zero energy, which lies above the superconducting phase and originates from the emerging one-particle-reducible structure in the self-energy.

Title: Local variations of the magnetization effected by an external field in molecular rings
Authors: N. P. Konstantinidis
Abstract: It is shown that an external magnetic field generates local variations of the classical ground-state magnetization in molecular rings of antiferromagnetic icosahedra with isotropic spin interactions. The magnetic response is characterized by a multitude of magnetization discontinuities occurring across the ring. In addition, a parity effect with respect to the number of icosahedra allows for magnetization jumps that occur at different field values for different molecules and produce an even more pronounced local variation of the magnetization. It is also found that for specific field ranges all canting angles of the molecular magnetizations increase with the field. These findings are in sharp contrast with the ones for rings of individual spins.

Title: Coupling between magnetism and band structure in a 2D semiconductor
Authors: Lihuan Sun, Marco Gibertini, Alessandro Scarfato, Menghan Liao, Fan Wu, Alberto F. Morpurgo, Christoph Renner
Abstract: Van der Waals semiconducting magnets exhibit a cornucopia of physical phenomena originating from the interplay of their semiconducting and magnetic properties. However, a comprehensive understanding of how semiconducting processes and magnetism are coupled is lacking. We address this question by performing scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements on the magnetic semiconductor CrPS$_4$, and by comparing the results to photoluminescence experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Below the magnetic transition, STS exhibit multiple features absent in the paramagnetic state, caused by the proliferation of electronic bands due to spin splitting with a large ($\simeq 0.5$ eV) exchange energy. The energetic differences between the band edges determined by STS match all observed photoluminescence transitions, which also proliferate in the magnetic state. DFT calculations quantitatively predict the relative positions of all detected bands, explain which pairs of bands lead to radiative transitions, and also reproduce the measured spatial dependence of electronic wavefunctions. Our results reveal how all basic optoelectronic processes observed in CrPS$_4$ can be understood in terms of the evolution of the electronic band structure when entering the magnetic state, and allow us to conclude that individual bands are fully spin-polarized over a broad energy interval.

Abstract: Unraveling collective modes arising from coupled degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding complex interactions in solids and developing new functionalities. Unique collective behaviors emerge when two degrees of freedom, ordered on distinct length scales, interact. Polar skyrmions, three-dimensional electric polarization textures in ferroelectric superlattices, disrupt the lattice continuity at the nanometer scale with nontrivial topology, leading to previously unexplored collective modes. Here, using terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond x-ray diffraction, we discovered subterahertz collective modes, dubbed 'skyrons', which appear as swirling patterns of atomic displacements functioning as atomic-scale gearsets. Momentum-resolved time-domain measurements of diffuse scattering revealed an avoided crossing in the dispersion relation of skyrons. We further demonstrated that the amplitude and dispersion of skyrons can be controlled by sample temperature and electric-field bias. Atomistic simulations and dynamical phase-field modeling provided microscopic insights into the three-dimensional crystallographic and polarization dynamics. The discovery of skyrons and their coupling with terahertz fields opens avenues for ultrafast control of topological polar structures.

Title: Theoretical investigations of electronic and optical properties of double perovskite Cs$_2$Tl$BX_6$ ($B=$ Bi, In; $X=$ Cl, Br, I) for photovoltaic application
Authors: Ardimas, Edi Suprayoga
Abstract: Lead-free double perovskites are gaining attention for photovoltaic (PV) applications due to their long carrier lifetimes, tunable bandgaps, and low toxicity. Using first-principles calculations, we studied the structural, electronic and optical properties of Cs$_2$Tl$BX_6$ ($B=$ Bi, In; $X=$ Cl, Br, I). The cubic phase (space group Fm3m) was analyzed within the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method. Our calculations predict direct bandgaps of 1.9-1.2 eV for Cs$_2$TlBi$X_6$ and indirect bandgaps of 2.4--0.8 eV for Cs$_2$TlIn$X_6$. Notably, the bandgap energy decreases with anion substitution from Cl to I, making these materials highly active in the near-infrared to visible light range. We reveal that Cs$_2$TlBi$X_6$ exhibits the highest optical absorption, with a peak value of $5\times10^5$ cm$^{-1}$ at an incident photon energy of 3 eV. Additionally, we evaluated the transport properties using the Boltzmann transport equations. The results indicate that Cs$_2$TlBi$X_6$ exhibit high electrical conductivity, reaching $8\times10^6$ S/m, and high electron mobility of 120 cm$^2/$V.s. PV performance analysis further reveals promising power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 42\%, with Cs$_2$TlBi$X_6$ showing significantly higher PCE than Cs$_2$TlIn$X_6$. These reports highlight the potential of Cs$_2$TlBi$X_6$ for advanced photovoltaic devices.

Title: Microwave resonator for measuring time-reversal symmetry breaking at cryogenic temperatures
Authors: T. Chouinard, D. M. Broun
Abstract: We present a microwave-frequency method for measuring polar Kerr effect and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) in unconventional superconductors. While this experiment is motivated by work performed in the near infrared using zero-loop-area Sagnac interferometers, the microwave implementation is quite different, and is based on the doubly degenerate modes of a TE$_{111}$ cavity resonator, which act as polarization states analogous to those of light. The resonator system has in-situ actuators that allow quadrupolar distortions of the resonator shape to be controllably tuned, as these compete with the much smaller perturbations that arise from TRSB. The most reliable way to the detect the TRSB signal is by interrogating the two-mode resonator system with circularly polarized microwaves, in which case the presence of TRSB shows up unambiguously as a difference between the forward and reverse transmission response of the resonator - i.e., as a breaking of reciprocity. We illustrate and characterize a coupler system that generates and detects circularly polarized microwaves, and then show how these are integrated with the TE$_{111}$ resonator, resulting in a dilution refrigerator implementation with a base temperature of 20 mK. We show test data on yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) ferrite as an illustration of how the system operates, then present data showing system performance under realistic conditions at millikelvin temperatures.

Title: Enhanced coercive force of nanoparticles of special morphology in the Stoner-Wohlfarth model
Authors: Vladimir P. Savin, Yury A. Koksharov
Abstract: We have found an unusual effect of increasing the coercive force in the Stoner-Wohlfarth model applied to magnetic nanoparticles of a special morphology. The particles consist of a ferromagnetic single-domain core surrounding by a magnetically soft shell. We have studied thoroughly individual and collective properties of these particles both through numerical calculations and analytical analysis. Fairly accurate approximate analytical formulas have been obtained for determining magnetization, hysteresis loop, coercive force, and other magnetic properties of the particles. The physical reason of the coercivity enhancement effect is the magnetic screening of a particle core by its shell. We have found the unambiguous conditions necessary for the existence of this effect. The large magnetization and moderate magnetic anisotropy of the core favor the effect of the coercivity enhancement.

Title: QR$^2$-code: An open-source program for double resonance Raman spectra
Authors: Jianqi Huang, Renhui Liu, Ye Zhang, Nguyen Tuan Hung, Huaihong Guo, Riichiro Saito, Teng Yang
Abstract: We present an open-source program, QR$^2$-code, that computes double-resonance Raman (DRR) spectra using first-principles calculations. QR$^2$-code can calculate not only two-phonon DRR spectra but also single-resonance Raman spectra and defect-induced DRR spectra. For defect-induced DDR spectra, we simply assume that the electron-defect matrix element of elastic scattering is a constant. Hands-on tutorials for graphene are given to show how to run QR$^2$-code for single-resonance, double-resonance, and defect-induced Raman spectra. We also compare the single-resonance Raman spectra by QR$^2$-code with that by QERaman code. In QR$^2$-code, the energy dispersions of electron and phonon are taken from Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) code, and the electron-phonon matrix element is obtained from the electron-phonon Wannier (EPW) code. All codes, examples, and scripts are available on the GitHub repository.

Title: Electron spin resonance with scanning tunneling microscopy: a tool for an on-surface quantum platform of identical qubits
Authors: Deung-Jang Choi, Soo-hyon Phark, Andreas J. Heinrich, Nicolás Lorente
Abstract: Integration of electron spin resonance (ESR) in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) has enabled an all-electrical control of atomic and molecular spins on solid surfaces with atomic-scale precision and energy resolution beyond thermal limitations. Further, coherent manipulation and detection of individual spins in an ESR-STM establishes a powerful quantum platform, allowing for the implementation of fundamental quantum logic operations to on-surface identical qubits. In this review, we introduce recent advances of ESR-STM, focusing on its application to atomic-scale qubits and extension to molecular qubit systems. We discuss the principles underlying ESR-STM, followed by single-spin addressability, coherent control via Rabi oscillations, and quantum state readout through frequency-resolved detection. We further demonstrate multi-qubit control architectures enabled by atom manipulation and local magnetic field engineering, culminating in the realization of multi-qubit logic gates such as the Controlled-NOT and Toffoli gates. These implementations highlight the specialty of ESR-STM towards atomic-scale quantum circuits. Indeed, ESR-STM can be an excellent tool to perform and evaluate quantum operations in molecular qubits. The results reviewed in this collection establish ESR-STM as a versatile tool for advancing quantum coherent science at the atomic and molecular level in solid-state environments.

Title: Accelerated snapping of slender beams under lateral forcing
Authors: Colin M. Meulblok, Hadrien Bense, M. Caelen, Martin van Hecke
Abstract: The hysteretic snapping under lateral forcing of a compressed, buckled beam is fundamental for many devices and mechanical metamaterials. For a single-tip lateral pusher, an important limitation is that snapping requires the pusher to cross the centerline of the beam. Here, we show that dual-tip pushers allow accelerated snapping, where the beam snaps before the pusher reaches the centerline. As a consequence, we show that when a buckled beam under increased compression comes in contact with a dual-tip pusher, it can snap to the opposite direction -- this is impossible with a single-tip pusher. Additionally, we reveal a novel two-step snapping regime, in which the beam sequentially loses contact with the two tips of the dual-tip pusher. To characterize this class of snapping instabilities, we employ a systematic modal expansion of the beam shape. This expansion allows us to capture and analyze the transition from one-step to two-step snapping geometrically. Finally we demonstrate how to maximize the distance between the pusher and the beam's centerline at the moment of snapping. Together, our work opens up a new avenue for quantitatively and qualitatively controlling and modifying the snapping of buckled beams, with potential applications in mechanical sensors, actuators, and metamaterials.

Title: Floquet topological phases of higher winding numbers in extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model under quenched drive
Authors: Rittwik Chatterjee, Asim Kumar Ghosh
Abstract: In this study topological properties of static and dynamic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models with staggered further neighbor hopping terms of different extents are investigated. Topological characterization of the static chiral models is established in terms of conventional winding number while Floquet topological character is studied by a pair of winding numbers. With the increase of extent of further neighbor terms topological phases with higher winding numbers are found to emerge in both static and dynamic systems. Topological phase diagrams of static models for four different extents of further neighbor terms are presented, which has been generalized for arbitrary extent afterwards. Similarly, Floquet topological phase diagrams of four such dynamic models have been presented. For every model four different parametrizations of hopping terms are introduced which exhibits different patterns of topological phase diagrams. In each case emergence of `0' and `$\pi$' energy edge states is noted and they are found to consistent to the bulk-boundary correspondence rule applicable for chiral topological systems.

Title: Quantum criticality and non-Fermi liquids: the nonperturbative renormalization group perspective
Authors: Mateusz Homenda, Pawel Jakubczyk, Hiroyuki Yamase
Abstract: We develop a thorough theoretical framework based on the nonperturvative renormalization group (RG) a la Wetterich to tackle the interplay of coupled fermionic and order-parameter fluctuations at metallic quantum critical points with ordering wavevectors $\vec{Q}=\vec{0}$. We consistently treat the dynamical emergence of the Landau damping of the bosonic mode and non-Fermi liquid scaling of fermions upon lowering the cutoff scale. The loop integrals of the present theory involve only contributions from fluctuations above the cutoff scale, which drive the system to a non-Fermi liquid RG fixed point of different scaling properties from those obtained within the random phase approximation (RPA) or expansions around it. In particular the scaling exponent for the Fermi self-energy acquires the value $\alpha\approx 0.50$ rather than the anticipated $\alpha\approx 0.66$, while the bosonic dynamical exponent $z\approx 2$. We demonstrate how results characteristic for the RPA-type fixed-point scaling are recovered in our framework by a questionable procedure of removing the fermionic cutoff much faster than the bosonic one.

Title: Cavity-Mediated Electron-Electron Interactions: Renormalizing Dirac States in Graphene
Authors: Hang Liu, Francesco Troisi, Hannes Hübener, Simone Latini, Angel Rubio
Abstract: Embedding materials in optical cavities has emerged as a strategy for tuning material properties. Accurate simulations of electrons in materials interacting with quantum photon fluctuations of a cavity are crucial for understanding and predicting cavity-induced phenomena. In this article, we develop a non-perturbative quantum electrodynamical approach based on a photon-free self-consistent Hartree-Fock framework to model the coupling between electrons and cavity photons in crystalline materials. We apply this theoretical approach to investigate graphene coupled to the vacuum field fluctuations of cavity photon modes with different types of polarizations. The cavity photons introduce nonlocal electron-electron interactions, originating from the quantum nature of light, that lead to significant renormalization of the Dirac bands. In contrast to the case of graphene coupled to a classical circularly polarized light field, where a topological Dirac gap emerges, the nonlocal interactions induced by a quantum linearly polarized photon mode give rise to the formation of flat bands and the opening of a topologically trivial Dirac gap. When two symmetric cavity photon modes are introduced, Dirac cones remain gapless, but a Fermi velocity renormalization yet indicates the relevant role of nonlocal interactions. These effects disappear in the classical limit for coherent photon modes. This new self-consistent theoretical framework paves the way for the simulation of non-perturbative quantum effects in strongly coupled light-matter systems, and allows for a more comprehensive discovery of novel cavity-induced quantum phenomena.

Title: Unconventional superconductivity of an altermagnetic metal: Polarized BCS and inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov states
Authors: Hui Hu, Zhao Liu, Xia-Ji Liu
Abstract: We investigate the superconductivity of two-dimensional spin-1/2 Fermi systems with $d$-wave altermagnetism under external magnetic field near zero temperature. At large altermagnetic coupling without magnetic field, we show that altermagnetism drives a second-order phase transition from the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state to an inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. The inclusion of magnetic field turns the BCS state into a long-sought polarized BCS superconductor with spin-population imbalance. It also shrinks the parameter window of the FFLO state and eventually leads to a nontrivial quantum tri-critical Lifshitz point, where two second-order phase transition lines between the polarized BCS, FFLO and normal states intersect. At small altermagnetic coupling, we find the usual route to the FFLO state driven by magnetic field. The presence of the altermagnetic coupling narrows the phase window of the FFLO state and creates another quantum Lifshitz point, where a first-order transition curve meets a second-order transition line. Between the two Lifshitz points, the transition from the polarized BCS state to the normal state is smooth. Our predicted rich phase diagram is relevant to some recently discovered unconventional magnets, including RuO$_{2}$ that exhibits a relatively high superconducting temperature in the thin film limit under applied strain. Our results of unconventional superfluidity are also testable in ultracold atom laboratories, where a spin-1/2 altermagnetic Fermi gas might be realizable upon loading into two-dimensional Hubbard lattices.

Title: Alkali Intercalation of Moire Heterostructures for Low-Loss Plasmonics
Authors: Ali Ghorashi, Nicholas Rivera, Ravishankar Sundararaman, Efthimios Kaxiras, John Joannopoulos, Marin Soljačić
Abstract: Two-dimensional metals generically support gapless plasmons with wavelengths well below the wavelength of free-space radiation at the same frequency. Typically, however, this substantial confinement of electromagnetic energy is associated with commensurately high losses, and mitigating such losses may only be achieved through judicious band structure engineering near the Fermi level. In a clean system, an isolated, moderately flat, band at the Fermi level with sufficiently high carrier density can support a plasmon that is immune to propagation losses up to some order in the electron-phonon interaction. However, proposed materials that satisfy these criteria have been ferromagnetic, structurally unstable, or otherwise difficult to fabricate. Here, we propose a class of band structure engineered materials that evade these typical pitfalls -- Moire heterostructures of hexagonal boron nitride intercalated with alkali atoms. We find that only sodium atoms engender a sufficiently isolated band with plasmons lossless at first order in the electron-phonon interaction. We calculate higher order electron-phonon losses and find that at frequencies of about $1$eV the electron-phonon decay mechanism is negligible -- leading to a contribution to the decay rate of about 10^7 Hz in a small frequency range. We next calculate losses from the electron-electron interaction and find that this is the dominant process -- leading plasmons to decay to lower frequency plasmons at a rate of around 10^14 Hz.

Title: Giant spin-to-charge conversion in germanium tin epilayers
Authors: S. Oyarzún, C. Gonzalez-Fuentes, Erick Burgos, M. Myronov, M. Jamet, R. L.Rodríguez-Suárez, F. Pezzoli
Abstract: We report a study of the spin-to-charge current conversion in compressively strained Ge1-xSnx alloy epilayers as a function of the Sn concentration by means of the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). The spin current is generated by spin-pumping effect (SPE) from a thin NiFe layer driven into ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). By simultaneously measuring the magnetic damping of the NiFe layer and the ISHE-induced charge current we extract two key spintronics parameters: the spin Hall angle and the effective spin mixing conductance. Our results reveal a giant spin-to-charge conversion and a non-monotonic dependence of the charge current signal on the Sn concentration, consistent with the variation in the magnetic damping observed in FMR. The values of spin Hall angle are comparable to those reported for heavy metals such as Pt and Ta. Furthermore, we show that the spin conductivity at the Au/GeSn interface can be enhanced by tuning the Sn concentration.

Title: Quantum Lifshitz points in an altermagnetic metal
Authors: Hui Hu, Xia-Ji Liu
Abstract: We predict the existence of two tri-critical quantum Lifshitz points in recently discovered $d$-wave altermagnetic metals subjected to an external magnetic field. These points connect a spatially modulated Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, a uniform polarized Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting phase, and the normal metallic phase in a nontrivial manner. Depending on whether the FFLO state is primarily induced by the magnetic field or by $d$-wave altermagnetism, we classify the corresponding Lifshitz points as field-driven or altermagnetism-driven, respectively. Notably, the two types exhibit distinct behaviors: the transition from the FFLO phase to the polarized BCS phase is first-order near the field-driven Lifshitz point, as might be expected, whereas it becomes continuous near the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point. We further explore the effects of finite temperature and find that the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point is significantly more sensitive to thermal fluctuations.

Title: Generalized Non-Hermitian Skin Effect
Authors: Zheng Wei, Ji-Yao Fan, Kui Cao, Xin-Ran Ma, Su-Peng Kou
Abstract: In this Letter, we present a unified theory termed the generalized non-Hermitian skin effect. This framework provides a universal characterization of typical one-dimensional non-Hermitian skin effects within the perturbative regime and unveils a novel type of skin effect that beyond the predictions of the generalized Brillouin zone theory, referred to as the relative skin effect. Previously recognized skin effects are classified as global skin effects, thereby explicitly delineating the scope and limitations of existing non-Bloch band theories. Additionally, we establish, for the first time, a phase transition criterion between global skin effects and relative skin effect, demonstrating the competition between these two distinct types of skin effects, emphasizing the pivotal role of real-space non-Hermitian terms in understanding skin effects and challenging the traditional reliance of non-Bloch band theory on momentum space. Our study substantially advances the conceptual framework of non-Hermitian physics and provides new theoretical tools for investigation.

Title: Inferring activity from the flow field around active colloidal particles using deep learning
Authors: Aditya Mohapatra, Aditya Kumar, Mayurakshi Deb, Siddharth Dhomkar, Rajesh Singh
Abstract: Active colloidal particles create flow around them due to non-equilibrium process on their surfaces. In this paper, we infer the activity of such colloidal particles from the flow field created by them via deep learning. We first explain our method for one active particle, inferring the $2s$ mode (or the stresslet) and the $3t$ mode (or the source dipole) from the flow field data, along with the position and orientation of the particle. We then apply the method to a system of many active particles. We find excellent agreements between the predictions and the true values of activity. Our method presents a principled way to predict arbitrary activity from the flow field created by active particles.

Title: Chiral near-field control of quantum light generation using magneto-optical graphene
Authors: Mikkel Have Eriksen, Joel D. Cox
Abstract: We theoretically explore strategies to actively control photon emission from quantum light sources by leveraging the large magneto-optical response of graphene. The quantum electrodynamic response of graphene -- characterized by the Purcell factor and the Lamb shift of a proximal emitter -- is analyzed for extended two-dimensional sheets, one-dimensional nanoribbons, and zero-dimensional nanodisks, all of which are endowed with an intrinsic chiral near-field response under a static perpendicular magnetic field. Using rigorous semianalytical models of these systems, we reveal that the emission properties can be readily tuned by variations in doping charge carrier density and applied magnetic field strength, both with respect to magnetoplasmon resonances (at infrared frequencies) and Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations (entering telecommunication bands) associated with optical transitions between discrete Landau levels. Localized magnetoplasmons in graphene nanoribbons are predicted to induce large dissymmetry in the spontaneous emission from left-hand and right-hand circularly polarized transitions in a proximal quantum emitter, presenting applications for chiral quantum optical waveguiding. This chiral dissymmetry is further enhanced in gyrotropic graphene nanodisks, signaling that the spatial shaping of near-fields in nanostructured graphene can significantly boost the intrinsic chiral response induced by the magnetic field. These results indicate that magneto-optical graphene constitutes a versatile and highly tunable platform for quantum light generation and manipulation at the nanoscale.

Title: High frequency permeability of the composite with ferromagnetic spherical shells
Authors: A.O. Sboychakov
Abstract: The paper studies high-frequency permeability of the composite materials consisting of hollow ferromagnetic particles embedded into the non-magnetic media. We model the ferromagnetic particles in composite by spherical shell: the thickness of the ferromagnetic region $d$ compared to the particles' diameter $D$ can vary in a wide range, from $d\ll D$ to $d\sim D$. We assume that the magnetization distribution in such a particle is non-uniform, but forms a vortex-like structure: the magnetization is twisted in some plain outside two vortex cores placed at the poles of the particle. The high-frequency permeability of such a composite material has been studied in the limit of non-interacting particles. We study the dependence of the permeability on the ratio $d/D$. It was shown, in particular, that in the limit $d/D\ll1$ the frequency dependence of the particle's susceptibility is quite similar to that for the thin film. At the same time, the magnetization oscillations in the ac field are non-homogeneous.

Abstract: Open-shell nanographenes have attracted significant attention due to their structurally tunable spin ground state. While most characterization has been conducted on weakly-interacting substrates such as noble metals, the influence of magnetic surfaces remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate how TbAu2, a rare-earth-element-based surface alloy, affects the magnetic properties of phenalenyl (or [2]triangulene (2T)), the smallest spin-1/2 nanographene. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements reveal a striking contrast: while 2T on Au(111) exhibits a zero-bias Kondo resonance - a hallmark of a spin-1/2 impurity screened by the conduction electrons of the underlying metal - deposition on TbAu2 induces a symmetric splitting of this feature by approximately 20 mV. We attribute this splitting to a strong proximity-induced interaction with the ferromagnetic out-of-plane magnetization of TbAu2. Moreover, our combined experimental and first-principles analysis demonstrates that this interaction is spatially modulated, following the periodicity of the TbAu2 surface superstructure. These findings highlight that TbAu2 serves as a viable platform for stabilizing and probing the magnetic properties of spin-1/2 nanographenes, opening new avenues for the integration of {\pi}-magnetic materials with magnetic substrates.

Title: Floquet engineering triplet superconductivity in superconductors with spin-orbit coupling or altermagnetism
Authors: Takehito Yokoyama
Abstract: We study superconductivitiy under light irradiation based on the Floquet-Magnus expansion in the high-frequency regime. We find that, in spin-singlet superconductors with spin-orbit coupling, triplet superconductivity can be induced in the first-order perturbation for dynamical gap functions and the second-order perturbation for static gap functions. We also show that, in unitary triplet superconductors with altermagnetism, nonunitary triplet superconductivity can emerge in the firstorder perturbation for dynamical gap function and in the second-order perturbation for static gap functions. These results indicate optical generation and control of triplet superconductivity.

Title: Topological properties of domain walls in antiferromagnetic topological insulators
Authors: Gabriele Naselli, Ion Cosma Fulga
Abstract: Motivated by the study of stacking faults in weak topological insulators and the observation of magnetic domain walls in MnBi$_{2n}$Te$_{3n+1}$, we explore the topological properties of domain walls in antiferromagnetic topological insulators. We develop two tight-binding models: one based on a strong topological insulator with antiferromagnetic order, and another built from stacked Chern insulators with alternating Chern numbers. Both systems are dual topological insulators, i.e. they are at the same time antiferromagnetic and crystalline topological insulators, but differ by the type of mirror symmetry protecting the crystalline phase: spinful versus spinless. We show that in the spinful case the mirror Chern number is invariant under time reversal and that it changes sign in the spinless case. This influences the properties of the two systems in the presence of a magnetic domain wall, which is created in the system when the magnetization is flipped via a time-reversal transformation. In the first type, the bulk of the domain wall is gapped but the defect will host chiral edge states when it ends on an external ferromagnetic surface. In the second, due to the flip in the mirror Chern number, the domain wall is a two-dimensional embedded semimetal with 2D gapless states protected by mirror symmetry. Our results show that domain walls can be a source of non-trivial topology, allowing to generate and manipulate gapless states within the bulk and the ferromagnetic surfaces of antiferromagnetic topological insulators.

Title: Spin-orbit physics stemming from mixed parity superconductivity: A relationship between mixed parity superconductivity and magnetism with spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Takehito Yokoyama
Abstract: We show that Hamiltonian for mixed parity superconductivity can be recast into that for magnetism with spin-orbit coupling by the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, indicating that mixed parity superconductivity and magnetism with spin-orbit coupling can share the same physics. As demonstrations, we discuss the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type interactions, magnetoelectric effect, supercurrent-induced spin current, and altermagnetism in mixed parity superconductors. All these effects originate purely from mixed parity superconductivity.

Title: Tuning the morphology of aerosolised cellulose nanocrystals via controlled aggregation
Authors: Daniel Warnes, Jia Hui Lim, Richard M. Parker, Bruno Frka-Petesic, Ray Freshwater, Camila Honorato-Rios, Yu Ogawa, Chiara Giorio, Silvia Vignolini
Abstract: Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are polycrystalline, rod-shaped nanoparticles isolated from cellulose, which have attracted increasing attention for a wide variety of applications. While there has been significant research into CNCs in suspensions, hydrogels and films, there have been remarkably few studies that investigated their properties during and after aerosolisation. Here, we studied how aerosolisation impacts the size and morphology of different CNCs suspensions with different surface functionalities. By building a new experimental setup, we observed that colloidally-metastable aqueous CNC suspensions, achieved by carboxylation of the surface hydroxy groups or by exposure to high intensity ultrasonication, yield large particulates upon aerosolisation under ambient temperatures. In contrast, aqueous suspensions of unfunctionalised CNCs tend to produce, upon aerosolisation, smaller particulates, despite suffering from poor colloidal stability in liquid suspension. Our results demonstrate that both the aerosolisation process itself and the properties of the CNC suspension play a crucial role in determining the final particle size and morphology of CNC-based particles, highlighting the need to consider colloidal stability and surface functionality when designing CNC-based materials for applications involving aerosol delivery or spray drying.

We also discuss the physical interpretation of this effect and give an estimation of its magnitude.

Title: First-Principles Calculation of Spin-Relaxation Due to Alloy and Electron-Phonon Scattering in Strained GeSn
Authors: Kevin Sewell, Felipe Murphy-Armando
Abstract: GeSn has emerged as a promising material for spintronics due to its long spin-lifetime, compatibility with silicon technology, high mobility and tunable electronic properties. Of particular interest is the transition from an indirect to a direct band gap with increasing Sn content, which enhances optical properties, electron transport and we find also affects spin transport behaviour, which is critical for spintronics applications. We use first-principles electronic-structure theory to determine the spin-flip electron-alloy scattering parameters in n-type GeSn alloys. We also calculate the previously undetermined intervalley electron spin-phonon scattering parameters between the $L$ and $\Gamma$ valleys. These parameters are used to determine the electron-alloy and electron-phonon scattering contributions to the n-type spin-relaxation of GeSn, as a function of alloy content and temperature. As in the case of phonon scattering, alloy scattering reduces the spin-relaxation time. However, switching the spin transport from the typical $L$ valley of Ge to the $\Gamma$ valley by sufficient addition of Sn, the relaxation time can be substantially increased. For unstrained, room temperature GeSn, we find a Sn concentration of at least $10\%$ is required to achieve a spin-relaxation time greater than Ge, with $17\%$ Sn needed to increase the spin-relaxation time from the nanosecond range to the microsecond range. At low temperatures (30K), adding $10\%$ Sn can increase the spin-relaxation time from $10^{-7}$s to 0.1s. Applying biaxial tensile strain to GeSn further increases the spin-relaxation time and at a lower Sn content than in unstrained GeSn.

Title: Magnetic correlations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities
Authors: Zheng Wei, Yanmei Cai, Boyang Wen, Tianxing Ma
Abstract: We explore magnetic correlations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities in an extended Hubbard model on honecycomb lattice incorporating third-nearest-neighbor hopping \( t'' \). Using quantum Monte Carlo methods, we identify a crossover between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations near higher-order Van Hove singularities filling, where \( t'' \) enhances ferromagnetic correlations below while suppressing antiferromagnetic fluctuations toward half-filling. At low doping, \( f_n \)-wave pairing dominates, amplified by higher-order Van Hove singularities-induced divergent density of states. Remarkably, despite general suppression of \( f_n \)-wave pairing by increasing next-nearest neighbor hopping \( t' \) and \( t'' \), a critical \( t'' = 0.15 \) triggers anomalous enhancement via higher-order Van Hove singularities renormalization at a fix $t'$. The nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions \( V \) suppress superconducting correlation, which exhibiting sign-independent suppression proportional to \( |V| \). These results highlight the interplay of higher-order Van Hove singularities-driven electronic structure, magnetic fluctuations, and pairing symmetry competition in electron correlated systems.

Title: Deciphering the role of LiBr as redox mediator in Li-O2 Aprotic Batteries
Authors: Angelica Petrongari, Lucrezia Desiderio, Adriano Pierini, Enrico Bodo, Mauro Giustini, Sergio Brutti
Abstract: Lithium-oxygen batteries are among the most promising energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density, but their practical implementation is hindered by poor reversibility and parasitic reactions. Redox mediators such as LiBr have emerged as a strategy to enhance reaction kinetics and reduce overpotentials. In this study, we explore the impact of three different solvents, dimethoxyethane (DME), tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), on the electrochemical performance and reaction pathways of LiBr-mediated Li-O2 cells. Our results reveal that a 1O2 evolution channel that leads to singlet oxygen-induced cell degradation is active only in the TEGDME-based electrolyte. Both DME and DMSO allow singlet oxygen-free Oxygen Evolution Reaction, but only DME is found chemically stable in the LiBr-mediated Li-O2 cell working conditions. These findings highlight the critical role of solvent-mediator interactions in determining the performance of Li-O2 cells.

Title: Thermodynamic Variational Principle Unifying Gravity and Heat Flow
Authors: Naoko Nakagawa, Shin-ichi Sasa
Abstract: Predicting the stable phase configuration in a liquid-gas system becomes a fundamental challenge when the stratification favored by gravity conflicts with arrangements induced by heat flow, particularly because standard equilibrium thermodynamics is insufficient in such non-equilibrium steady states. We propose a variational principle based on an extended thermodynamics, called global thermodynamics, to address this state selection problem. Our key finding is that gravity and heat flow effects are unified into a single parameter, ``effective gravity'' ($g_\mathrm{eff}$), within this framework. Crucially, the sign of $g_\mathrm{eff}$ determines the stable configuration: liquid is at the bottom if $g_\mathrm{eff} > 0$, and floats above the gas if $g_\mathrm{eff} < 0$. This provides a quantitative tool for the configuration prediction under competing drives.

Title: Uncovering Magnetic Phases with Synthetic Data and Physics-Informed Training
Authors: Agustin Medina, Marcelo Arlego, Carlos A. Lamas
Abstract: We investigate the efficient learning of magnetic phases using artificial neural networks trained on synthetic data, combining computational simplicity with physics-informed strategies. Focusing on the diluted Ising model, which lacks an exact analytical solution, we explore two complementary approaches: a supervised classification using simple dense neural networks, and an unsupervised detection of phase transitions using convolutional autoencoders trained solely on idealized spin configurations. To enhance model performance, we incorporate two key forms of physics-informed guidance. First, we exploit architectural biases which preferentially amplify features related to symmetry breaking. Second, we include training configurations that explicitly break $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, reinforcing the network's ability to detect ordered phases. These mechanisms, acting in tandem, increase the network's sensitivity to phase structure even in the absence of explicit labels. We validate the machine learning predictions through comparison with direct numerical estimates of critical temperatures and percolation thresholds. Our results show that synthetic, structured, and computationally efficient training schemes can reveal physically meaningful phase boundaries, even in complex systems. This framework offers a low-cost and robust alternative to conventional methods, with potential applications in broader condensed matter and statistical physics contexts.

Title: Computer simulations show that liquid-liquid phase separation enhances self-assembly
Authors: Layne B. Frechette, Naren Sundararajan, Fernando Caballero, Anthony Trubiano, Michael F. Hagan
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are liquid- or gel-like droplets of proteins and nucleic acids formed at least in part through liquid-liquid phase separation. Condensates enable diverse functions of cells and the pathogens that infect them, including self-assembly reactions. For example, it has been shown that many viruses form condensates within their host cells to compartmentalize capsid assembly and packaging of the viral genome. Yet, the physical principles controlling condensate-mediated self-assembly remain incompletely understood. In this article we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of a condensate on the assembly of icosahedral capsids. The capsid subunits are represented by simple shape-based models to enable simulating a wide range of length and time scales, while the condensate is modeled implicitly to study the effects of phase separation independent of the molecular details of biomolecular condensates. Our results show that condensates can significantly enhance assembly rates, yields, and robustness to parameter variations, consistent with previous theoretical predictions. However, extending beyond those predictions, the computational models also show that excluded volume enables control over the number of capsids that assemble within condensates. Moreover, long-lived aberrant off-pathway assembly intermediates can suppress yields within condensates. In addition to elucidating condensate-mediated assembly of viruses and other biological structures, these results may guide the use of condensates as a generic route to enhance and control self-assembly in human-engineered systems.

Title: Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium MaxEnt
Authors: Miguel Aguilera, Sosuke Ito, Artemy Kolchinsky
Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables (such as spatiotemporal correlation functions). It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. It may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different kinds of interactions, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.

Title: Dimensional crossover of class D real-space topological invariants
Authors: Martin Rodriguez-Vega, Terry A. Loring, Alexander Cerjan
Abstract: The topological properties of a material depend on its symmetries, parameters, and spatial dimension. Changes in these properties due to parameter and symmetry variations can be understood by computing the corresponding topological invariant. Since topological invariants are typically defined for a fixed spatial dimension, there is no existing framework to understand the effects of changing spatial dimensions via invariants. Here, we introduce a framework to study topological phase transitions as a system's dimensionality is altered using real-space topological markers. Specifically, we consider Shiba lattices, which are class D materials formed by magnetic atoms on the surface of a conventional superconductor, and characterize the evolution of their topology when an initial circular adatom island is deformed into a chain. We also provide a measure of the corresponding protection against disorder. Our framework is generalizable to any symmetry class and spatial dimension, potentially guiding the design of materials by identifying, for example, the minimum thickness of a slab required to maintain three-dimensional topological properties.

Title: Hopf Bifurcation of Nonlinear Non-Hermitian Skin Effect
Authors: Kohei Kawabata, Daichi Nakamura
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, nonreciprocity-induced anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates, represents a hallmark of non-Hermitian topological systems with no analogs in Hermitian systems. Despite its significance across various open classical and quantum systems, the influence of nonlinearity has remained largely unclear. Here, we reveal the Hopf bifurcation of the nonlinear skin effect as a critical phenomenon unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that nonlinearity destabilizes skin states and instead gives rise to the emergence of delocalized states associated with limit cycles in phase space. We also uncover the algebraically localized critical skin effect precisely at the Hopf bifurcation point. We illustrate these behavior in a nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model in both continuum and lattice. Our work shows a significant role of nonlinearity in the skin effect and uncovers rich phenomena arising from the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity.

Title: Coexistence of charge density wave and field-tuned magnetic states in TmNiC$_2$
Authors: Kamil K. Kolincio, Marta Roman, Valerio Tammurello, Simone Di Cataldo, Daniel Matulka, Sonia Francoual, Berthold Stöger, Herwig Michor
Abstract: Exploring the relations between coexisting, cooperative, or competing types of ordering is a key to identify and harness the mechanisms governing the mutual interactions between them, and to utilize their combined properties. We have experimentally explored the response of the charge density wave (CDW) to various antiferromagnetic, metamagnetic, and field-aligned ferromagnetic states that constitute the magnetic phase diagram of TmNiC$_2$. The high resolution x-ray diffraction experiment employing synchrotron radiation at low temperature and high magnetic field, allowed to follow the superstructure satellite reflections, being a sensitive probe of CDW. This investigation not only reveals direct evidence that the charge density wave avoids even a partial suppression in the antiferromagnetic ground state but also proves that this state coexists, without any visible signatures of weakening, in the entire dome of the magnetically ordered phases, including the field-aligned ferromagnetic state. The calculations of the electronic and phonon structures support the experiment, revealing that the dominant contribution to the CDW transition stems from momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling. We conclude that this mechanism prevents the CDW from vanishing, although the nesting conditions within the magnetically ordered phases deteriorate.

Title: Giant elastoresistance in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Xuetao Ma, Zhaoyu Liu, Jiaqi Cai, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Xiaodong Xu, Jiun-Haw Chu, Matthew Yankowitz
Abstract: Strongly correlated and topological phases in moiré materials are exquisitely sensitive to lattice geometry at both atomic and superlattice length scales. Twist angle, pressure, and strain directly modify the lattice, and thus act as highly effective tuning parameters. Here we examine electrical transport in twisted bilayer graphene subjected to continuous uniaxial strain. Near the magic angle ($\approx 1.1^{\circ}$), devices exhibit a pronounced elastoresistance that depends on band filling and temperature, with a gauge factor more than two orders of magnitude larger than that of conventional metals. In selected doping regimes the elastoresistance exhibits a Curie-Weiss-like temperature divergence. We discuss possible microscopic origins, including nematic fluctuations and enhanced electronic entropy from fluctuating isospin moments. Our work establishes uniaxial strain as a versatile probe of correlated physics in a moiré material.

Title: Networked Infectiousness: Cascades, Power Laws, and Kinetics
Authors: Sara Najem, Leonid Klushin, Jihad Touma
Abstract: Networked SIR models have become essential workhorses in the modeling of epidemics, their inception, propagation and control. Here, and building on this venerable tradition, we report on the emergence of a remarkable self-organization of infectiousness in the wake of a propagating disease front. It manifests as a cascading power-law distribution of disease strength in networked SIR simulations, and is then confirmed with suitably defined kinetics, then stochastic modeling of surveillance data. Given the success of the networked SIR models which brought it to light, we expect this scale-invariant feature to be of universal significance, characterizing the evolution of disease within and across transportation networks, informing the design of control strategies, and providing a litmus test for the soundness of disease propagation models.

Title: Magnon Nesting in Driven Two-Dimensional Quantum Magnets
Authors: Hossein Hosseinabadi, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak, Eugene Demler, Jamir Marino
Abstract: We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring Fermi surface nesting instabilities in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.

Title: Computational screening and experimental validation of promising Wadsley-Roth Niobates
Authors: Zachary J. L. Bare, CJ Sturgill, Manish Kumar, Iva Milisavljevic, Hans-Conrad zur Loye, Scott Misture, Morgan Stefik, Christopher Sutton
Abstract: The growing demand for efficient, high-capacity energy storage systems has driven extensive research into advanced materials for lithium-ion batteries. Among the various candidates, Wadsley-Roth (WR) niobates have emerged as a promising class of materials for fast Li+ storage due to rapid ion diffusion within their ReO3-like blocks in combination with good electronic conductivity along the shear planes. Despite the remarkable features of WR phases, there are presently less than 30 known structures which limits identification of structure-property relationships for improved performance as well as the identification of phases with more earth-abundant elements. In this work, we have dramatically expanded the set of potentially (meta)stable compositions (with $\Delta$ Hd < 22 meV/atom) to 1301 (out of 3283) through high-throughput screening with density functional theory (DFT). This large space of compound was generated through single- and double-site substitution into 10 known WR-niobate prototypes using 48 elements across the periodic table. To confirm the structure predictions, we successfully synthesized and validated with X-ray diffraction a new material, MoWNb24O66. The measured lithium diffusivity in MoWNb24O66 has a peak value of 1.0x10-16 m2/s at 1.45 V vs. Li/Li+ and achieved 225 mAh/g at 5C. Thus a computationally predicted phase was realized experimentally with performance exceeding Nb16W5O55, a recent WR benchmark. Overall, the computational dataset of potentially stable novel compounds and with one realized that has competitive performance provide a valuable guide for experimentalists in discovering new durable battery materials.

Title: Observing Bethe strings in an attractive Bose gas far from equilibrium
Authors: Milena Horvath, Alvise Bastianello, Sudipta Dhar, Rebekka Koch, Yanliang Guo, Jean-Sébastien Caux, Manuele Landini, Hanns-Christoph Nägerl
Abstract: Bethe strings are bound states of constituent particles in a variety of interacting many-body one-dimensional (1D) integrable quantum models relevant to magnetism, nanophysics, cold atoms and beyond. As emergent fundamental excitations, they are predicted to collectively reshape observable equilibrium and dynamical properties. Small individual Bethe strings have recently been observed in quantum magnets and superconducting qubits. However, creating states featuring intermixtures of many, including large, strings remains an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, using nearly integrable ultracold Bose gases, we realize such intermixtures of Bethe strings out of equilibrium, by dynamically tuning interactions from repulsive to attractive. We measure the average binding energy of the strings, revealing the presence of bound states of more than six particles. We find further evidence for them in the momentum distribution and in Tan's contact, connected to the correlated density. Our data quantitatively agree with predictions from generalized hydrodynamics (GHD). Manipulating intermixtures of Bethe strings opens new avenues for understanding quantum coherence, nonlinear dynamics and thermalization in strongly-interacting 1D systems.

Title: Low-temperature structural instabilities of the halide double perovskite Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ investigated via x-ray diffraction and infrared phonons
Authors: Collin Tower, Fereidoon S. Razavi, Jeremy Dion, Jürgen Nuss, Reinhard K. Kremer, Maureen Reedyk
Abstract: The halide double perovskite Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ has been proposed as a potential replacement for organic halide perovskites for photovoltaic applications. Further investigation of its dielectric response, optical properties and structural stability is thus warranted. Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ exhibits a well-documented structural phase transition at 120 K but indications for an additional lower temperature ($\sim$40 K) phase transition have also been reported. On the basis of measurements of the specific heat capacity, temperature dependent powder X-ray diffraction, low frequency capacitance, and infrared reflectivity we clarify the previously reported splitting of phonon modes in the Raman spectrum at $\sim$40 K as due to a subtle structural phase transition from the tetragonal I4/m structure to a monoclinic $P12_1$/$n1$ crystal structure. The infrared active vibrational modes are experimentally investigated in the three structural regimes. In the cubic structure at room temperature the four IR active modes are observed at 135,$\sim$95, 55, and $\sim$25 cm$^{-1}$, as the symmetry reduces to tetragonal a minute splitting of these modes is expected, however below 40 K an additional mode is observed indicating a further reduction in symmetry.

Title: Topology and the Conformal Invariance of Nodal Lines in Two-Dimensional Active Scalar Turbulence
Authors: Christopher Eling
Abstract: The inverse cascade in two-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence exhibits a mysterious phenomenon. Numerical simulations have shown that the nodal isolines of certain scalars actively transported in the flow (eg, the vorticity in Navier-Stokes theory) obey Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE), which indicates the presence of conformal invariance. Therefore, these turbulent isolines are somehow in the same class as cluster boundaries in equilibrium statistical mechanical models at criticality, such as critical percolation. In this paper, we propose that the inverse cascade is characterized by a local energy (or in some cases, enstrophy) flux field that spontaneously breaks time reversal invariance. The turbulent state consists of random constant flux domains, with the nodal isolines acting as domain walls where the local flux vanishes. The generalized circulation of the domains is proportional to a topological winding number. We argue that these turbulent states are gapped states, in analogy with quantum Hall systems. The turbulent flow consists of many strongly coupled vortices that are analogous to quasi-particles. The nodal isolines are associated with the gapless topological degrees of freedom in the flow, where scale invariance is enhanced to conformal invariance. We introduce a concrete model of this behavior using a two-dimensional effective theory involving the canonical Clebsch scalars. This theory has patch solutions that exhibit power law scaling. The fractional winding number associated with the patches can be related to the Kolmogorov-Kraichnan scaling dimension of the corresponding fluid theory. We argue that the fully developed inverse cascade is a scale invariant gas of these patches. This theory has a conformally invariant sector described by a Liouville conformal field theory whose central charge is fixed by the fractional winding number.

Title: Defect Conformal Manifolds from Phantom (Non-Invertible) Symmetries
Authors: Andrea Antinucci, Christian Copetti, Giovanni Galati, Giovanni Rizi
Abstract: We explore a general mechanism that allows (1+1)d CFTs to have interesting interface conformal manifolds even in the absence of any continuous internal symmetry or supersymmetry. This is made possible by the breaking of an enhanced continuous symmetry, which is generically non-invertible, arising in the folded theory. We provide several examples and showcase the power of the symmetry-based approach by computing the evolution of the reflection coefficient along the defect conformal manifold. We also discuss higher-dimensional generalizations and we comment on no-go theorems.

Title: Complexity transitions in chaotic quantum systems
Authors: Gopal Chandra Santra, Alex Windey, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Andrea Legramandi, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer Rényi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer Rényi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.

Title: A Generative Neural Annealer for Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization
Authors: Yuan-Hang Zhang, Massimiliano Di Ventra
Abstract: We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.

Title: Topological photonics of generalized and nonlinear eigenvalue equations
Authors: Takuma Isobe, Tsuneya Yoshida, Yasuhiro Hatsugai
Abstract: Topological photonics is developed based on the analogy of Schrödinger equation which is mathematically reduced to a standard eigenvalue equation. Notably, several photonic systems are beyond the standard topological band theory as they are described by generalized or nonlinear eigenvalue equations. In this article, we review the topological band theory of this category. In the first part, we discuss topological photonics of generalized eigenvalue equations where the band structure may take complex values even when the involved matrices are Hermitian. These complex bands explain the characteristic dispersion relation of hyperbolic metamaterials. In addition, our numerical analysis predicts the emergence of symmetry-protected exceptional points in a photonic crystal composed of negative index media. In the second part, by introducing auxiliary bands, we establish the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence under ``weak" nonlinearity of eigenvalues. The nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence elucidates the robustness of chiral edge modes in photonic systems where the permittivity and permeability are frequency dependent.

Title: Two-local modifications of SYK model with quantum chaos
Authors: Masanori Hanada, Sam van Leuven, Onur Oktay, Masaki Tezuka
Abstract: The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model may provide us with a good starting point for the experimental study of quantum chaos and holography in the laboratory. Still, the four-local interaction of fermions makes quantum simulation challenging, and it would be good to search for simpler models that keep the essence. In this paper, we argue that the four-local interaction may not be important by introducing a few models that have two-local interactions. The first model is a generalization of the spin-SYK model, which is obtained by replacing the spin variables with SU($d$) generators. Simulations of this class of models might be straightforward on qudit-based quantum devices. We study the case of $d=3, 4, 5, 6$ numerically and observe quantum chaos already for two-local interactions in a wide energy range. We also introduce modifications of spin-SYK and SYK models that have similar structures to the SU($d$) model (e.g., $H=\sum_{p,q}J_{pq}\chi_p\chi_{p+1}\chi_q\chi_{q+1}$ instead of the original SYK Hamiltonian $H=\sum_{p,q,r,s}J_{pqrs}\chi_p\chi_q\chi_r\chi_{s}$), which shows strongly chaotic features although the interaction is essentially two-local. These models may be a good starting point for the quantum simulation of the original SYK model.

Title: Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations without quantum corrections: A coherent-incoherent correspondence approach
Authors: Tomohiro Nishiyama, Yoshihiko Hasegawa
Abstract: We introduce the coherent-incoherent correspondence as a framework for deriving quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations under continuous measurement in Lindblad dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence establishes a mapping between the original quantum system with coherent evolution and a corresponding incoherent system without coherent dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence relates quantities across these two systems, including jump statistics, dynamical activity, and entropy production. Since the classical-like properties of the incoherent system allow us to derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations in the incoherent system, we can transfer the relations from the incoherent to the coherent system via the coherent-incoherent correspondence. This enables the derivation of quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations for the original coherent system. Unlike existing quantum uncertainty relations, which typically include explicit quantum correction terms, our approach avoids these additional terms. This framework provides a general approach to deriving trade-offs in quantum thermodynamics.

Title: Role of scrambling and noise in temporal information processing with quantum systems
Authors: Weijie Xiong, Zoë Holmes, Armando Angrisani, Yudai Suzuki, Thiparat Chotibut, Supanut Thanasilp
Abstract: Scrambling quantum systems have been demonstrated as effective substrates for temporal information processing. While their role in providing rich feature maps has been widely studied, a theoretical understanding of their performance in temporal tasks is still lacking. Here we consider a general quantum reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove exponential memory decays with iterations for local noisy channels. Proving these results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum learning models.

Title: Extreme Synchronization Transitions
Authors: Seungjae Lee, Lennart J. Kuklinski, Marc Timme
Abstract: Across natural and human-made systems, transition points mark sudden changes of order and are thus key to understanding overarching system features. Motivated by recent experimental observations, we here uncover an intriguing class of transitions in coupled oscillators, extreme synchronization transitions, from asynchronous disordered states to synchronous states with almost completely ordered phases. Whereas such a transition appears like discontinuous or explosive phase transitions, it exhibits markedly distinct features. First, the transition occurs already in finite systems of $N$ units and so constitutes an intriguing bifurcation of multi-dimensional systems rather than a genuine phase transition that emerges in the thermodynamic limit $N\rightarrow \infty$ only. Second, the synchronization order parameter jumps from moderate values of the order of $N^{-1/2}$ to values extremely close to $1$, its theoretical maximum, immediately upon crossing a critical coupling strength. We analytically explain the mechanisms underlying such extreme transitions in coupled complexified Kuramoto oscillators. Extreme transitions may similarly occur across other systems of coupled oscillators as well as in certain percolation processes. In applications, their occurrence impacts our ability of ensuring or preventing strong forms of ordering, for instance in biological and engineered systems.

Title: High-performance local automaton decoders for defect matching in 1D
Authors: Louis Paletta, Anthony Leverrier, Mazyar Mirrahimi, Christophe Vuillot
Abstract: Local automaton decoders offer a promising path toward real-time quantum error correction by replacing centralized classical decoding, with inherent hardware constraints, by a natively parallel and streamlined architecture from a simple local transition rule. We propose two new types of local decoders for the quantum repetition code in one dimension. The signal-rule decoders interpret odd parities between neighboring qubits as defects, attracted to each other via the exchange of classical point-like excitations, represented by a few bits of local memory. We prove the existence of a threshold in the code-capacity model and present numerical evidence of exponential logical error suppression under a phenomenological noise model, with data and measurement errors at each error correction cycle. Compared to previously known local decoders that suffer from sub-optimal threshold and scaling, our construction significantly narrows the gap with global decoders for practical system sizes and error rates. Implementation requirements can be further reduced by eliminating the need for local classical memories, with a new rule defined on two rows of qubits. This shearing-rule works well at relevant system sizes making it an appealing short-term solution. When combined with biased-noise qubits, such as cat qubits, these decoders enable a fully local quantum memory in one dimension.

Title: Modeling droplet-particle interactions on solid surfaces by coupling the lattice Boltzmann and discrete element methods
Authors: Abhinav Naga, Xitong Zhang, Junyu Yang, Halim Kusumaatmaja
Abstract: We introduce a numerical method for investigating interfacial flows coupled with frictional solid particles. Our method combines the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to model the dynamics of a two-component fluid and the discrete element method (DEM) to model contact forces (normal reaction, sliding friction, rolling friction) between solid particles and between solid particles and flat solid surfaces. To couple the fluid and particle dynamics, we (1) use the momentum exchange method to transfer hydrodynamic forces between the fluids and particles, (2) account for different particle wettability using a geometric boundary condition, and (3) explicitly account for capillary forces between particles and liquid-fluid interfaces using a 3D capillary force model. We benchmark the contact forces by investigating the dynamics of a particle bouncing off a solid surface and rolling down an inclined plane. To benchmark the hydrodynamic and capillary forces, we investigate the Segrè-Silberberg effect and measure the force required to detach a particle from a liquid-fluid interface, respectively. Motivated by the self-cleaning properties of the lotus leaf, we apply our method to investigate how drops remove contaminant particles from surfaces and quantify the forces acting on particles during removal. Our method makes it possible to investigate the influence of various parameters that are often difficult to tune independently in experiments, including contact angles, surface tension, viscosity, and coefficient of friction between the surface and particles. Our results highlight that friction plays a crucial role when drops remove particles from surfaces.

Title: Dynamics of reactive oxygen species produced by the COST microplasma jet
Authors: Sascha Chur, Robin Minke, Youfan He, Máté Vass, Thomas Mussenbrock, Ralf Peter Brinkmann, Efe Kemaneci, Lars Schücke, Volker Schulz-von der Gathen, Andrew R. Gibson, Marc Böke, Judith Golda
Abstract: This study is focused on measuring the densities of the excited molecular oxygen species, O$_{2}(\text{a}^{1}\Delta_{\text{g}})$ and O$_{2}(\text{b}^{1}\Sigma_{\text{g}}^{+})$, produced in a COST atmospheric pressure plasma jet using a helium-oxygen mixture. Knowledge of the ozone density is critical for measurements because of its high quenching rate of these species. Additionally O$_{2}(\text{a}^{1}\Delta_{\text{g}})$ is difficult to measure, due to its low emission intensity and sensitivity to background interference in the plasma region. Therefore a flow cell was used to enhance signal detection in the effluent region. To validate the measurements and improve understanding of reaction mechanisms, results were compared with two simulation models: a pseudo-1D plug flow simulation and a 2D fluid simulation. The plug flow simulation provided an effective means for estimating species densities, with a fast computation time. The 2D simulation offered a more realistic description of the flow dynamics, which proved critical to correctly describe the experimental trends. However, it requires long computation times to reach an equilibrium state in the flow cell. Otherwise, it leads to discrepancies to the experimental data. Further discrepancies arose, from an overestimation of the ozone density from the models, as validated from the O$_{2}(\text{b}^{1}\Sigma_{\text{g}}^{+})$ density measurements. Optimizing the reaction rate coefficients for the effluent region might improve the agreement with the experimental results. Despite these limitations both simulations aligned reasonably well with experimental data, showcasing the well validated plasma chemistry of the models, even for complicated effluent geometries.

Abstract: The power of photothermal spectroscopic imaging to visualize antimicrobial interaction on the surface of individual bacteria cells has been demonstrated on the model system Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and vancomycin using mid-infrared photo-induced force microscopy (PiF-IR, also mid-IR PiFM). High-resolution PiF contrasts obtained by merging subsequent PiF-IR scans at two different illumination frequencies revealed chemical details of cell wall destruction after 30 and 60 min incubation with vancomycin with a spatial resolution of $\approx 5$ nm. This approach compensates local intensity variations induced by near-field coupling of the illuminating electric field with nanostructured surfaces, which appear in single-frequency contrasts in photothermal imaging methods, as shown by [Anindo et al., J. Phys. Chem C, 2025, 129, 4517]. Spectral shifts associated with hydrogen bond formation between vancomycin and the N-acyl-D-Ala4-D-Ala5 termini in the peptidoglycan cell wall have been observed in chemometrics of PiF-IR spectra from treated and untreated B. subtilis harvested after 30 min from the same experiment. The vancomyin interaction in the piecrust of a progressing septum is located with $\approx 10$ nm resolution exemplarily using PiF contrasts of three selected bands of a PiF-IR hyperspectral scan of an individual B. subtilis cell harvested after 30 min incubation. Our results provide a new perspective for visualizing the chemical interaction of antibiotics on the surface of microbes with few nanometer resolution.

Title: Metal oxide decoration on Si-FETs for selective gas sensing at room temperature
Authors: A. Shahid, J. Gum, S. Mokkapati, R. Unnithan
Abstract: Metal oxide semiconductors have been thoroughly studied for gas sensing applications due to the electrical transduction phenomenon in the presence of gaseous analytes. The chemiresistive sensors prevalent in the applications have several challenges associated with them inclusive of instability, longevity, temperature/humidity sensitivity, and power consumption due to the need of heaters. Herein, we present a silicon field effect transistor-based gas sensor functionalized with CuO. The oxidized Cu thin film acts as a selective room temperature H2S sensor with impressive response and recovery. Using this methodology, we propose a standalone compact enose based on our results for a wide spectrum of gas detection.

Title: High-fidelity dispersive spin sensing in a tuneable unit cell of silicon MOS quantum dots

Abstract: Metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) technology is a promising platform for developing quantum computers based on spin qubits. Scaling this approach will benefit from compact and sensitive sensors that minimize constraints on qubit connectivity while being industrially manufacturable. Here, we demonstrate a compact dispersive spin-qubit sensor, a single-electron box (SEB), within a bilinear unit cell of planar MOS quantum dots (QDs) fabricated using an industrial grade 300 mm wafer process. By independent gate control of the SEB and double-quantum-dot tunnel rates, we optimize the sensor to achieve a readout fidelity of 99.92% in 340us (99% in 20us), fidelity values on a par with the best obtained with less compact sensors. Furthermore, we develop a Hidden Markov Model of the two-electron spin dynamics that enables a more accurate calculation of the measurement outcome and hence readout fidelity. Our results show how high-fidelity sensors can be introduced within silicon spin-qubit architectures while maintaining sufficient qubit connectivity as well as providing faster readout and more efficient initialisation schemes.

Title: Weighted Active Space Protocol for Multireference Machine-Learned Potentials
Authors: Aniruddha Seal, Simone Perego, Matthew R. Hennefarth, Umberto Raucci, Luigi Bonati, Andrew L. Ferguson, Michele Parrinello, Laura Gagliardi
Abstract: Multireference methods such as multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) offer an effective means of capturing electronic correlation in systems with significant multiconfigurational character. However, their application to train machine learning-based interatomic potentials (MLPs) for catalytic dynamics has been challenging due to the sensitivity of multireference calculations to the underlying active space, which complicates achieving consistent energies and gradients across diverse nuclear configurations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Weighted Active-Space Protocol (WASP), a systematic approach to assign a consistent active space for a given system across uncorrelated configurations. By integrating WASP with MLPs and enhanced sampling techniques, we propose a data-efficient active learning cycle that enables the training of an MLP on multireference data. We demonstrate the method on the TiC+-catalyzed C-H activation of methane, a reaction that poses challenges for Kohn-Sham density functional theory due to its significant multireference character. This framework enables accurate and efficient modeling of catalytic dynamics, establishing a new paradigm for simulating complex reactive processes beyond the limits of conventional electronic-structure methods.

Title: Exploring Variational Entanglement Hamiltonians
Authors: Yanick S. Kind, Benedikt Fauseweh
Abstract: Recent advances in analog and digital quantum-simulation platforms have enabled exploration of the spectrum of entanglement Hamiltonians via variational algorithms. In this work we analyze the convergence properties of the variationally obtained solutions and compare them to numerically exact calculations in quantum critical systems. We demonstrate that interpreting the cost functional as an integral permits the deployment of iterative quadrature schemes, thereby reducing the required number of measurements by several orders of magnitude. We further show that a modified ansatz captures deviations from the Bisognano-Wichmann form in lattice models, improves convergence, and provides a cost-function-level diagnostic for quantum phase transitions. Finally, we establish that a low cost value does not by itself guarantee convergence in trace distance. Nevertheless, it faithfully reproduces degeneracies and spectral gaps, which are essential for applications to topological phases.

Title: On the definition of heat current for periodic systems and its implications for simulations of thermal conductivity in solids
Authors: Andrey Pereverzev
Abstract: We re-derive the expression for the heat current for a classical system subject to periodic boundary conditions and show that it can be written as a sum of two terms. The first term is a time derivative of the first moment of the system energy density while the second term is expressed through the energy transfer rate through the periodic boundary. We show that in solids the second term alone leads to the same thermal conductivity as the full expression for the heat current when used in the Green-Kubo approach. More generally, energy passing though any surface formed by translation of the original periodic boundary can be used to calculate thermal conductivity. These statements are verified for two systems: crystalline argon and crystals of argon and krypton forming an interface.

Title: Vortical currents and reciprocal relations for transport coefficients in the electron hydrodynamic regime
Authors: Nisarg Chadha, Subroto Mukerjee
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic regime in metals with momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering. The conservation of momentum results in well-defined dynamics whose effects we investigate via the relevant continuity equations. We find anomalous contributions to the charge and heat transport currents arising from gradients of the velocity field in a semiclassical treatment with a Berry curvature. These contributions are non-vanishing for systems lacking inversion symmetry, and the corresponding transport coefficients do not obey the standard Onsager reciprocity relations. Instead, we show that the response coefficients relating the currents to the stress tensor obey independent reciprocity relations with the stress tensor and thus exhibit cross-tensor effects of charge and heat transport with the momentum transport. The Berry curvature contribution to the stress magnetization tensor is also derived.

Title: Atomistic mechanisms of dynamics in a two-dimensional dodecagonal quasicrystal
Authors: Kun Zhao, Matteo Baggioli, Wen-Sheng Xu, Jack F. Douglas, Yun-Jiang Wang
Abstract: Quasicrystals have been observed in a variety of materials ranging from metal alloys to block copolymers. However, their structural and dynamical properties cannot be readily described in terms of conventional solid-state models of liquids and solids. We may expect the dynamics of this specific class of quasicrystalline materials to be more like glass-forming liquids in the sense of exhibiting large fluctuations in the local mobility ("dynamic heterogeneity") and non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of relaxation and diffusion. In this work, we investigate a model dodecagonal quasicrystal material in two dimensions (2D) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a focus on heterogeneous dynamics and non-Arrhenius relaxation and diffusion. As observed in glass-forming liquids and heated crystals, we observe a two-stage relaxation dynamics in the self-intermediate scattering function $F_s(k,t)$ of our quasicrystal material. It involves a fast $\beta$-relaxation and $\alpha$ relaxation process having a highly temperature dependent relaxation time whose activation energy varies in concert with the extent of string-like collective motion, a phenomenon recognized to occur in glass-forming liquids at low temperatures and crystalline materials at elevated temperatures. After examining the dynamics of our dodecagonal quasicrystalline material in great detail, we conclude that the dynamics of these materials more closely resembles observations on metallic glass-forming liquids than crystalline materials.

Title: Unconventional domain tessellations in moiré-of-moiré lattices

Abstract: Imposing incommensurable periodicity on the periodic atomic lattice can lead to complex structural phases consisting of locally periodic structure bounded by topological defects. Twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) is an ideal material platform to study the interplay between different atomic periodicities, which can be tuned by twist angles between the layers, leading to moiré-of-moiré lattices. Interlayer and intralayer interactions between two interfaces in TTG transform this moiré-of-moiré lattice into an intricate network of domain structures at small twist angles, which can harbor exotic electronic behaviors. Here we report a complete structural phase diagram of TTG with atomic scale lattice reconstruction. Using transmission electron microscopy combined with a new interatomic potential simulation, we show several large-scale moiré lattices, including triangular, kagome, and a corner-shared hexagram-shaped domain pattern. Each domain is bounded by a two-dimensional network of domain wall lattices. In the limit of small twist angles, two competing structural orders-rhombohedral and Bernal stackings-with a slight energy difference, cause unconventional lattice reconstruction with spontaneous symmetry breaking and nematic instability, highlighting the importance of long-range interlayer interactions across entire van der Waals layers. The diverse tessellation of distinct domains, whose topological network can be tuned by the adjustment of the twist angles, establishes TTG as a platform for exploring the interplay between emerging quantum properties and controllable nontrivial lattices.

Title: Detecting Phase Coherence of 2D Bose Gases via Noise Correlations
Authors: Shinichi Sunami, Vijay P. Singh, Erik Rydow, Abel Beregi, En Chang, Ludwig Mathey, Christopher J. Foot
Abstract: We measure the noise correlations of two-dimensional (2D) Bose gases after free expansion, and use them to characterize the in-situ phase coherence across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. The noise-correlation function features a characteristic spatial oscillatory behavior in the superfluid phase, which gives direct access to the superfluid exponent. This oscillatory behavior vanishes above the BKT critical point, as we demonstrate for both single-layer and decoupled bilayer 2D Bose gases. Our work establishes noise interferometry as an important general tool to probe and identify many-body states of quantum gases, extending its application to previously inaccessible correlation properties in multimode systems.

Title: Evidence of surface $p$-wave superconductivity and higher-order topology in MoTe$_2$
Authors: Sangyun Lee, Myungjun Kang, Duk Y. Kim, Jihyun Kim, Suyeon Cho, Sangmo Cheon, Tuson Park
Abstract: Exploration of nontrivial superconductivity and electronic band topology is at the core of condensed matter physics and applications to quantum information. The transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) MoTe$_2$ has been proposed as an ideal candidate to explore the interplay between topology and superconductivity, but their studies remain limited regarding the required high-pressure environments. Here, we observe proximity-induced surface $p$-wave superconductivity, and investigate the higher-order topological nature of MoTe$_2$ in its 1T$'$ phase, which emerges from the T$_d$ phase through a high-pressure-induced topological phase transition. Using surface-sensitive soft-point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy, we confirm the emergence of surface $s+p$-wave superconductivity via the BTK model as well as a zero-bias conductance peak. Such surface $p$-wave superconductivity emerges via the proximity effect between an $s$-wave superconducting band and a second-order topological band, which is protected by the time-reversal and inversion symmetries. The temperature dependence of the surface $p$-wave superconducting gap shows a correlation with that of the bulk $s$-wave gap, as well as its suppression by an external magnetic field or a reduction in pressure, implying its proximity-induced origin. Moreover, we suggest that the topological hinge states, derived from second-order topological bands, evolve into zero-energy Majorana corner states in this proximity-effect-induced third-order topological superconducting phase. These results demonstrate the potential realization of topological superconductivity in MoTe$_2$, thus opening a pathway for studying various topological natures of TMDC materials.

Title: Decoherence of Histories: Chaotic Versus Integrable Systems
Authors: Jiaozi Wang, Philipp Strasberg
Abstract: We study the emergence of decoherent histories in isolated systems based on exact numerical integration of the Schrödinger equation for a Heisenberg chain. We reveal that the nature of the system, which we switch from (i) chaotic to (ii) interacting integrable to (iii) non-interacting integrable, strongly impacts decoherence \new{of coarse spin observables}. From a finite size scaling law we infer a strong exponential suppression of coherences for (i), a weak exponential suppression for (ii) and no exponential suppression for (iii) on a relevant short (nonequilibrium) time scale. Moreover, for longer times we find stronger decoherence for (i) but the opposite for (ii), hinting even at a possible power-law decay for (ii) at equilibrium time scales. This behaviour is encoded in the multi-time properties of the quantum histories and it can not be explained by environmentally induced decoherence. Our results suggest that chaoticity plays a crucial role in the emergence of classicality in finite size systems.

Title: Enhancing superconductivity via engineered polaronic environment
Authors: Krzysztof Kempa, Michael J. Naughton
Abstract: A vanishing dielectric function is required for longitudinal plasmonic or polaronic modes in a polarizable uniform medium and, in general, heralds the presence of singular charge fluctuations. It is also known that a vanishing dielectric function of an environment strengthens Cooper pairing in a superconductor via resonant anti-shielding (RAS), regardless of pairing origin. We combine these ideas in a strategy to strongly enhance superconductivity. Specifically, we propose a superlattice in which a unit cell consists of an ultrathin superconductor film in direct contact with a monolayer of a metal-organic framework material. This structure possesses a momentum-independent and resonant effective dielectric function, a key feature for RAS-enhanced superconductivity. We show that the superlattice facilitates near perfect volumetric intermixing between the superconductor and the engineered dielectric environment. To estimate the critical temperature $T_c$ enhancement, we use the unrestricted Leuven's scaling method, which relates the spectral integral of the RAS-renormalized Eliashberg function $\alpha^2$F to $T_c$, which we showed previously to be in excellent agreement with ab initio simulations, and which we posit may underlie recent observations of enhanced $T_c$ in FeSe on SrTiO$_3$. We carried out a renormalization of the bare $\alpha^2$F, dividing it directly by |$\epsilon_{DE} (\omega)|^2$, where $\epsilon_{DE} (\omega)$ is the q-independent dielectric function of the dielectric environment. Our estimates show that ambient temperature and pressure operation could be achievable in the RAS scheme. We also calculated the quantum Fisher information from the dynamic charge susceptibility in the normal state (for vanishing losses) in our proposed superlattice, and our estimate suggests the presence of superconductivity signatures well above $T_c$ due to quantum charge entanglement buildup.

Title: Generation of Weyl points and a nodal line by magnetization reorientation in Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$

Abstract: Topological magnets exhibit fascinating properties like topologically protected surface states or anomalous transport phenomena. While these properties can be significantly altered by manipulating the magnetic state, the experimental verification of such predictions remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the efficient magnetic field control of the Weyl semimetallic state of the collinear ferromagnet Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ by magneto-optical spectroscopy. We resolve a redshift of the nodal loop resonance as the magnetization is rotated into the kagome plane by the magnetic field. Our material-specific theory, capturing the observed field-induced spectral reconstruction, shows the creation of 26 Weyl points for one in-plane magnetization direction and predicts the emergence of a gapless nodal loop for the orthogonal in-plane magnetization orientation. These findings demonstrate that while topological band structures are generally considered robust, breaking underlying crystal symmetries with external fields provides an efficient way to manipulate them, even in collinear magnets. This approach opens exciting avenues to control band topology also in materials with more complex magnetic structures and even to study the interplay of real- and momentum-space topological states, e.g. in skyrmion-lattice systems.

Title: Enhanced magnetic dichroism in darkfield UV photoemission electron microscopy
Authors: Maximilian Paleschke, David Huber, Friederike Wührl, Cheng-Tien Chiang, Frank O. Schumann, Jürgen Henk, Wolf Widdra
Abstract: Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) has evolved into an indispensable tool for structural and magnetic characterization of surfaces at the nanometer scale. In strong contrast to synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray PEEM as a leading method for element-specific magnetic properties via magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), laboratory ultraviolet (UV) PEEM has seen limited application with much smaller dichroism effects for in-plane magnetization. Here we introduce darkfield PEEM as a novel approach to enhance MCD contrast in threshold photoemission, enabling efficient MCD imaging with significantly enhanced contrast by an order-of-magnitude for Fe(001). This advancement paves the way for MCD imaging on femtosecond timescales using modern lasers. The experimental results will be quantitatively benchmarked against advanced relativistic photoemission calculations.

Title: Physical synchronization of soft self-oscillating limbs for fast and autonomous locomotion
Authors: Alberto Comoretto, Harmannus A.H. Schomaker, Johannes T.B. Overvelde
Abstract: Animals achieve robust locomotion by offloading regulation from the brain to physical couplings within the body. In contrast, locomotion in artificial systems often depends on centralized processors. We introduce a rapid and autonomous locomotion strategy with synchronized gaits emerging through physical interactions between self-oscillating limbs and the environment, without control signals. Each limb is a single soft tube that only requires constant flow of air to perform cyclic stepping motions at frequencies reaching 300 hertz. By combining several of these self-oscillating limbs, their physical synchronization enables locomotion speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than comparable state-of-the-art. Through body-environment dynamics, these seemingly simple devices exhibit autonomy, including obstacle avoidance, amphibious gait transitions, and phototaxis.

Title: Josephson diodes induced by the loop current states
Authors: Qi-Kai Shen, Yi Zhang
Abstract: We study the diode effect of the supercurrent in the Josephson junctions with the loop current states as the tunneling barrier. The loop current states are realized by the Haldane model which preserves the inversion symmetry and thus forbids the diode effect. We demonstrate how the inversion symmetry can be broken in the monolayer and bilayer systems. In the monolayer system, inversion symmetry can be broken by either introducing a sublattice staggered potential for the Haldane model or introducing a modified Haldane model, and in the bilayer system, it can be broken by either staking the two layers with opposite current directions or by directly applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers. We further show that the diode efficiency can be tuned by the interlayer coupling and the strength of the electric field or interlayer voltage. Our results provide another route to realize the Josephson diode effect by breaking the time-reversal symmetry through the loop-current states.

Title: Computing the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional Strongly-Correlated Systems
Authors: Sounak Sinha, Derek Y. Pan, Barry Bradlyn
Abstract: We show that the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and strongly-correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi-single particle states associated to the many-body ground state of an insulator, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the different many-body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to known band-theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane-Mele model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane-Mele model with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly-interacting system.

Title: Localization transitions in quadratic systems without quantum chaos
Authors: Mateusz Lisiecki, Lev Vidmar, Patrycja Łydżba
Abstract: Transitions from delocalized to localized eigenstates have been extensively studied in both quadratic and interacting models. The delocalized regime typically exhibits diffusion and quantum chaos, and its properties comply with the random matrix theory (RMT) predictions. However, it is also known that in certain quadratic models, the delocalization in position space is not accompanied by the single-particle quantum chaos. Here, we study the one-dimensional Anderson and Wannier-Stark models that exhibit eigenstate transitions from localization in quasimomentum space (supporting ballistic transport) to localization in position space (with no transport) in a nonstandard thermodynamic limit, which assumes rescaling the model parameters with the system size. We show that the transition point may exhibit an unconventional character of Janus type, i.e., some measures hint at the RMT-like universality emerging at the transition point, while others depart from it. For example, the eigenstate entanglement entropies may exhibit, depending on the bipartition, a volume-law behavior that either approaches the value of Haar-random Gaussian states, or converges to a lower, non-universal value. Our results hint at rich diversity of volume-law eigenstate entanglement entropies in quadratic systems that are not maximally entangled.

Title: Ultra-critical Floquet Non-Fermi Liquid
Authors: Li-kun Shi, Oles Matsyshyn, Justin C. W. Song, Inti Sodemann Villadiego
Abstract: We demonstrate that periodically driven Fermions coupled to simple bosonic baths have steady state occupations of Floquet Bloch bands that generically display non-analyticties at certain momenta which resemble the Fermi surfaces of equilibrium non-Fermi liquids. Remarkably these non-equilibrium Fermi surfaces remain sharp even when the bath is at finite temperature, leading to critical power-law decaying correlations at finite temperature, a phenomenon with no analogue in equilibrium. We also show that generically there is in-gap current rectification for clean metals lacking inversion symmetry, and explain why this occurs universally regardless of the details of collisions.

Title: Observation of a Bilayer Superfluid with Interlayer Coherence
Authors: Erik Rydow, Vijay P. Singh, Abel Beregi, En Chang, Ludwig Mathey, Christopher J. Foot, Shinichi Sunami
Abstract: Controlling the coupling between different degrees of freedom in many-body systems is a powerful technique for engineering novel phases of matter. We create a bilayer system of two-dimensional (2D) ultracold Bose gases and demonstrate the controlled generation of bulk coherence through tunable interlayer Josephson coupling. We probe the resulting correlation properties of both phase modes of the bilayer system: the symmetric phase mode is studied via a noise-correlation method, while the antisymmetric phase fluctuations are directly captured by matter-wave interferometry. The measured correlation functions for both of these modes exhibit a crossover from short-range to quasi-long-range order above a coupling-dependent critical point, thus providing direct evidence of bilayer superfluidity mediated by interlayer coupling. We map out the phase diagram and interpret it with renormalization-group theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we elucidate the underlying mechanism through the observation of suppressed vortex excitations in the antisymmetric mode.

Title: Yukawa-Lorentz Symmetry of Tilted Non-Hermitian Dirac Semimetals at Quantum Criticality
Authors: Sergio Pino-Alarcón, Vladimir Juričić
Abstract: Dirac materials, hosting linearly dispersing quasiparticles at low energies, exhibit an emergent Lorentz symmetry close to a quantum critical point (QCP) separating semimetallic state from a strongly-coupled gapped insulator or superconductor. This feature appears to be quite robust even in the open Dirac systems coupled to an environment, featuring non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac fermions: close to a strongly coupled QCP, a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry emerges in terms of a unique terminal velocity for both the fermion and the bosonic order parameter fluctuations, while the system can either retain non-Hermiticity or completely decouple from the environment thus recovering Hermiticity as an emergent phenomenon. We here show that such a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry can emerge at the quantum criticality even when the NH Dirac Hamiltonian includes a tilt term at the lattice scale. As we demonstrate by performing a leading order $\epsilon=3-d$ expansion close to $d=3$ upper critical dimension of the theory, a tilt term becomes irrelevant close to the QCP separating the NH Dirac semimetal and a gapped (insulating or superconducting) phase. Such a behavior also extends to the case of the linear-in-momentum non-tilt perturbation, introducing the velocity anisotropy for the Dirac quasiparticles, which also becomes irrelevant at the QCP. These predictions can be numerically tested in quantum Monte Carlo lattice simulations of the NH Hubbard-like models hosting low-energy NH tilted Dirac fermions.

Title: A kinetically constrained model exhibiting non-linear diffusion and jamming
Authors: Abhishek Raj, Vadim Oganesyan, Antonello Scardicchio
Abstract: We present a classical kinetically constrained model of interacting particles on a triangular ladder, which displays diffusion and jamming and can be treated by means of a classical-quantum mapping. Interpreted as a theory of interacting fermions, the diffusion coefficient is the inverse of the effective mass of the quasiparticles which can be computed using mean-field theory. At a critical density \r{ho} = 2/3, the model undergoes a dynamical phase transition in which exponentially many configurations become jammed while others remain diffusive. The model can be generalized to two dimensions.

Title: Impurity effects in twisted carbon nanotubes
Authors: Yuriy G. Pogorelov, Volodymyr Turkowski, Vadim M. Loktev
Abstract: We consider electronic spectra of twisted carbon nanotubes and their perturbation by impurity atoms absorbed at different positions on nanotube surface within the framework of Anderson hybrid model. A special attention is given to the cases when 1D Weyl (massless Dirac) modes are present in the nanotube spectrum and their hybridization with localized impurity states produces, with growing impurity concentration c, onset of a mobility gap near the impurity level and then opening, at yet higher c, of some narrow range of delocalized states within this mobility gap. Such behaviors are compared with similar effects in the previously studied 2D graphene, carbon nanoribbons, and non-twisted carbon nanotubes. Some possible practical applications are discussed.

Title: Electrokinetic nanofluidic sensing of DNA nanostar condensate
Authors: Kuang-Hua Chou, Alexander Eden, David E. Huber, Sumita Pennathur, Deborah Kuchnir Fygenson
Abstract: We demonstrate electronic sensing of DNA nanostar (NS) condensate. Specifically, we use electrokinetic nanofluidics to observe and interpret how temperature-induced NS condensation affects nanochannel current. The increase in current upon filling a nanochannel with NS condensate indicates that its electrophoretic mobility is about half that of a single NS and its effective ionic strength is $\sim35$% greater than that of 150mM NaCl in phosphate buffer. $\zeta$-potential measurements before and after exposure to NS show that condensate binds the silica walls of a nanochannel more strongly than individual NS do under identical conditions. This binding increases electroosmotic flow, possibly enough to completely balance, or even exceed, the electrophoretic velocity of NS condensate. Although the current through a flat nanochannel is erratic in the presence of NS condensate, tilting the nanochannel to accumulate NS condensate at one entrance (and away from the other) results in a robust electronic signature of the NS phase transition at temperatures $T_c$ = $f$([NaCl]) that agree with those obtained by other methods. Electrokinetic nanofluidic detection and measurement of NS condensate thus provides a foundation for novel biosensing technologies based on liquid-liquid phase separation.

Title: Femtosecond and attosecond phase-space correlations in few-particle photoelectron pulses
Authors: Rudolf Haindl, Valerio Di Giulio, Armin Feist, Claus Ropers
Abstract: Temporal correlations in pulsed electron beams reflect the microscopic dynamics of emission and interparticle interaction. In femtosecond electron emission from nanoscale field emitters, Coulomb interactions result in structured few-electron states with strong correlations in energy, time, and transverse momentum. Interactions with external fields may be used to both probe and further manipulate these correlated states. Here, we combine femtosecond-gated, event-based detection with inelastic electron-light scattering to directly map the photoelectron phase-space distribution of two-electron states. Our experiments demonstrate a bimodal structure in longitudinal phase space, with distinct contributions from interparticle interaction and dispersion. Moreover, we theoretically reveal that global phase modulation coherently shapes the few-electron phase-space distribution to exhibit attosecond temporal correlations. This controlled phasing of few-electron states can be harnessed to produce tailored excitations and super-radiance via two-electron energy post-selection.

Title: Quantum charge sensing using a semiconductor device based on $δ$-layer tunnel junctions
Authors: Juan P. Mendez, Denis Mamaluy
Abstract: We report a nanoscale device concept based on a highly doped $\delta$-layer tunnel junction embedded in a semiconductor for charge sensing. Recent advances in Atomic Precision Advanced Manufacturing (APAM) processes have enabled the fabrication of devices based on quasi-2D, highly conductive, highly doped regions, known as $\delta$-layers, in semiconductor materials. In this work, we demonstrate that APAM $\delta$-layer tunnel junctions are ultrasensitive to the presence of charges near the tunnel junction, allowing the use of these devices for detecting charges by observing changes in the electrical current. We demonstrate that these devices can enhance the sensitivity in the limit, i.e., for small concentrations of charges, exhibiting significantly superior sensitivity compared to traditional FET-based sensors. We also propose that the extreme sensitivity arises from the strong quantization of the conduction band in these highly-confined systems.

Title: Linear response of tilted anisotropic two-dimensional Dirac cones
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of the linear-response coefficients, when in-plane electric field ($\mathbf E$) or/and temperature gradient ($\nabla_{\mathbf r} T$) is/are applied on a two-dimensional semimetal harbouring anisotropic Dirac cones. The anisotropy is caused by (1) differing Fermi velocities along the two mutually perpendicular momentum axes, and (2) tilting parameters. Using the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the forms of the response coefficients, in the absence and presence of a nonquantizing magnetic field $\mathbf B$. The magnetic field affects the response only when it is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the material, with the resulting expressions computed with the help of the so-called Lorentz-force operator, appearing in the linearized Boltzmann equation. The solution has to be found in a recursive manner, which produces terms in powers of $|\mathbf B|$. We discuss the validity of the Mott relation and the Wiedemann-Franz law for the Lorentz-operator-induced parts.

Title: Inversion of Dislocation-Impurity Interactions in $α$-Fe under Magnetic State Changes
Authors: Franco Moitzi, Lorenz Romaner, Andrei V. Ruban, Swarnava Ghosh, Markus Eisenbach, Oleg E. Peil
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dislocation-impurity interaction energies and their profiles for various \textit{3d} elements \textemdash V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Co \textemdash in and around $1/2\langle111\rangle$ screw dislocations in $\alpha$-Fe using \textit{ab initio} methods. We consider the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states, with the latter being modeled through both the disordered local moment model and a spin-wave approach. Our findings reveal that (1) magnetic effects are large compared to size misfit effects of substitutional impurities, and (2) dislocation-impurity interactions are dependent on the magnetic state of the matrix and thermal lattice expansion. In particular, Cu changes from core-attractive in the ferromagnetic state to repulsive in the paramagnetic state.

Title: Stress-induced phase transformations in Ti-15Mo alloy at elevated temperature
Authors: Petr Harcuba, Tomáš Krajňák, Dalibor Preisler, Jiří Kozlík, Josef Stráský, Jana Šmilauerová, Fernando Gustavo Warchomicka, Miloš Janeček
Abstract: Controlled mechanical loading was applied to Ti-15Mo alloy during annealing at 550 $^\circ$C. Massive formation of the $\omega_{\textrm{iso}}$ phase from the parent $\beta$-phase occurred during annealing at 550 $^\circ$C without external stress or with stress well below the yield stress. Moreover, a massive $\alpha$ phase precipitation takes place under simultaneous annealing and plastic deformation. Plastic deformation plays a key role in $\beta\rightarrow\alpha$ transformation and achieving refined $\alpha+\beta$ type microstructure resulted in improved mechanical properties. Studying phase transformations during plastic deformation is critical for understanding and optimizing thermomechanical processing of metastable $\beta$-Ti alloys.

Title: Spectral properties from an efficient analytical representation of the $GW$ self-energy within a multipole approximation
Authors: Dario A. Leon, Kristian Berland, Claudia Cardoso
Abstract: We propose an efficient analytical representation of the frequency-dependent $GW$ self-energy $\Sigma$ via a multipole approximation (MPA-$\Sigma$). The multipole-Padé model for the self-energy is interpolated from a small set of numerical evaluations of $\Sigma$ in the complex frequency plane, similarly to the previously multipole representation developed for the screened Coulomb interaction (MPA-$W$) [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 115157 (2021)]. We show that, likewise MPA-$W$, an appropriate choice of frequency sampling in MPA-$\Sigma$ is critical to guarantee computational efficiency and high accuracy. The combined MPA-$W$ and MPA-$\Sigma$ scheme considerably reduces the cost of full-frequency self-energy calculations, especially for spectral band structures over a wide energy range. Crucially, MPA-$\Sigma$ enables a multipole representation for the interacting Green's function $G$ (MPA-$G$), providing a straightforward evaluation of all the spectral properties, and a more general way to define the renormalization factor $Z$. We validate the MPA-$\Sigma$ and MPA-$G$ approaches for diverse systems: bulk Si, Na and Cu, monolayer MoS$_2$, the NaCl ion-pair and the F$_2$ molecule. Moreover, we introduce toy MPA-$\Sigma$/$G$ models to examine the quasiparticle picture in different regimens of weak and strong correlation. With these models, we expose limitations in defining $Z$ from the local derivative of $\Sigma$.

Title: Landscape of Correlated Orders in Strained Bilayer Nickelate Thin Films
Authors: Congcong Le, Jun Zhan, Xianxin Wu, Jiangping Hu
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has sparked significant research interest. This interest has been further fueled by the recent achievement of superconductivity in compressed thin films at ambient pressure, although the origin and underlying mechanism remain elusive. In this work, we explore the electronic structures and instabilities of strained thin films on substrates to identify the key factors for achieving superconductivity, using first-principles and functional renormalization group (FRG) calculations. Our findings suggest that the compressed NiO$_2$ bilayer at the interface is unlikely to exhibit superconductivity due to the elongation of outer apical Ni-O bond length and electron-doping effect. In contrast, the NiO$_2$ bilayer slightly away from the interface shows density-wave instability when undoped or slightly hole-doped. However, when this bilayer is moderately hole-doped, leading to the emergence of a hole pocket around the M point, density-wave instability is suppressed and the system exhibits robust $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity, which may account for superconductivity observed in thin films. For the stretched NiO$_2$ bilayer, robust spin-density-wave instability is observed due to enhanced Fermi surface nesting, despite the presence of a hole pocket around the M point. Potential experimental implications are discussed. Our study highlights the crucial role of fermiology in determining electronic instability and establishes a unified scenario for superconductivity in both pressurized bulk and strained thin films of bilayer nickelates.

Title: Renormalization-group approach to the Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity: Amplification of the pairing gap from $\ell^4$ to $\ell$
Authors: Yuki Fujimoto
Abstract: We revisit the renormalization group (RG) analysis of the Kohn-Luttinger (KL) mechanism for superconductivity. The KL mechanism leads to superconductivity in a system with a repulsive bare interaction. The key ingredient is the screening effect that renders the induced interaction attractive in channels with nonzero angular momentum $\ell \neq 0$, thereby triggering the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) instability. According to the original argument, the resulting gap is exponentially small, with its exponent scaling as $-\ell^4$. However, the KL mechanism was originally formulated within perturbation theory, where the series is known to converge poorly in certain cases -- most notably, for the p-wave paring gap induced by a repulsive s-wave contact interaction. This poor convergence may be attributed to a divergent integrand in a specific class of diagrams containing both the BCS logarithm and the Kohn anomaly, suggesting that one must resum the Kohn anomaly contributions separately from the BCS logarithm. In this work, we incorporate the Kohn anomaly contribution into the beta function of the RG equation governing the BCS instability near the Fermi surface. Our solution shows that the KL gap exponent is then proportional to $-\ell$, indicating a significant enhancement of the KL mechanism beyond the previously known result. To illustrate this, we study the spin-triplet p-wave pairing gap arising from a repulsive s-wave contact interaction and compare our RG-based results with those obtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in perturbation theory.

Title: Resonance Raman Scattering and Anomalous Anti-Stokes Phenomena in CrSBr
Authors: Satyam Sahu, Charlotte Berrezueta-Palacios, Sabrina Juergensen, Kseniia Mosina, Zdeněk Sofer, Matěj Velický, Patryk Kusch, Otakar Frank
Abstract: CrSBr, a van der Waals material, stands out as an air-stable magnetic semiconductor with appealing intrinsic properties such as crystalline anisotropy, quasi-1D electronic characteristics, layer-dependent antiferromagnetism, and non-linear optical effects. In this study, we investigate the differences between the absorption and emission spectra, focusing on the origin of the emission peak near 1.7 eV observed in the photoluminescence spectrum of CrSBr. Our findings are corroborated by excitation-dependent Raman experiments. Additionally, we explore the anti-Stokes Raman spectra and observe an anomalously high anti-Stokes to Stokes intensity ratio of up to 0.8, which varies significantly with excitation laser power and crystallographic orientation relative to the polarization of the scattered light. This ratio is notably higher than that observed in graphene ($\approx$ 0.1) and MoS$_2$ ($\approx$ 0.4), highlighting the unique vibrational and electronic interactions in CrSBr. Lastly, we examine stimulated Raman scattering and calculate the Raman gain in CrSBr, which attains a value of 1 $\times$ 10$^{8}$ cm/GW, nearly four orders of magnitude higher than that of previously studied three-dimensional systems.

Title: Realization of discretized response in rare-earth vanadates accessed by AC susceptibility and magnetocaloric methods
Authors: Yuntian Li, Linda Ye, Mark P. Zic, Arkady Shekhter, Ian R. Fisher
Abstract: This report presents a new technique to probe the quantitative dynamical response of the magnetic field induced heating/cooling process in rare-earth vanadium materials. The approach combines AC susceptibility and AC caloric measurements to reveal the intrinsic timescale associated with the magnetic relaxation process of rare-earth ions at low temperatures. Utilizing the well-known crystal field effect in YbVO4, we prove and demonstrate a discretized thermal analysis through a common spin-lattice relaxation phenomenon. The demonstration experiment presented in this study provides a general approach to quantitatively address multiple measured quantities in one unified discretized thermal circuit analysis. It can be extended to study other magnetic, dielectric, and elastic materials exhibiting a complex response to an external driving field in the presence of intrinsic interactions and fluctuations, particularly when an energy dissipation process is within an accessible frequency regime.

Title: First passage time properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic diffusion coefficients
Authors: Go Uchida, Hiromi Miyoshi, Hitoshi Washizu
Abstract: Diffusion in a heterogeneous environment or diffusion of a particle that shows conformational fluctuations can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (DCs). In the present study, we investigate first passage time (FPT) properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic DCs that are positive and non-zero. We show that for diffusion in one-dimensional semi-infinite domain with an absorbing boundary, the eventual absorption is certain. We also show that compared to diffusion whose DC is the ensemble average of a stochastic DC, in diffusion with the stochastic DC, there are particles that reach the absorbing boundary earlier. The approximate proportion of preceding particles is determined by the probability distribution of the time average of a stochastic DC for a given distance to the absorbing boundary. In addition, when particles begin to reach the absorbing boundary before the time change in a stochastic DC occurs, a stochastic DC with a larger supremum leads to an earlier arrival of particles at the absorbing boundary even if the ensemble averages of stochastic DCs are the same. For ergodic DCs, three more properties are revealed. The mean FPT is infinite. In addition, if particles take a long time to reach the absorbing boundary, the exact proportion of preceding particles is almost zero and the FPT distribution can be approximated by the Lévy-Smirnov distribution. We show that these three properties of diffusion with an ergodic DC result from the convergence of the time average of the DC to the ensemble average. For three-dimensional diffusion with a spherical absorbing boundary, we obtain essentially the same results, except that the eventual absorption is not certain. Our results suggest that fluctuations in a DC play an important role in diffusion-limited reactions triggered by single molecules in physics, chemistry, or biology.

Title: Thermal boundary conductance in standalone and non-standalone GaN/AlN heterostructures predicted using machine learning interatomic potentials
Authors: Hao Zhou, Khalid Zobaid Adnan, Wyatt Allen Jones, Tianli Feng
Abstract: GaN/AlN interfaces are essential in advanced high-power and high-frequency electronic devices, where effective thermal management is crucial for optimal performance and reliability. This work investigates the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of standalone and non-standalone GaN/AlN heterostructures using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) driven by accurate machine learning interatomic potentials trained from density-functional theory calculations. For the standalone interface, the TBC is found to be ~600 MW m-2 K-1 at room temperature after quantum correction, with possible ~60% elastic and ~40% inelastic contributions. The result revises previous NEMD predictions (400 - 2000 MW m-2 K-1) using empirical interatomic potentials. When a second GaN/AlN interface is brought close to the original interface, the TBC of the original interface can increase to 1000 MW m-2 K-1, and this value gradually decreases with increasing distance between the two interfaces. When multiple interfaces are introduced in proximity, the first interface's TBC can be further enhanced to above 1150 MW m-2 K-1. After comparing double interfaces, superlattices, and random multilayers, it is concluded that such enhancement of TBC is not caused by the emergence of coherent superlattice modes but rather by the ballistic transport of the original bulk phonon modes of each material. Additionally, a "critical separation distance" (l_cs) is defined as the threshold beyond which the two interfaces no longer influence each other and behave independently. l_cs is determined by the mean free path of the phonons filtered by the interfaces that transport in the middle layer between two interfaces. Our findings provide insights into the thermal transport mechanisms that may aid the design of future electronic devices.

Title: Evidence of competing ground states between fractional Chern insulator and antiferromagnetism in moiré MoTe2

Abstract: Two-dimensional moire materials present unprecedented opportunities to explore quantum phases of matter arising from the interplay of band topology and strong this http URL of the most striking examples is the recent observation of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe2) with relatively large twist angles(~3.7deg-3.9deg). The electronic ground states are usually expected to be sensitive to the twist angle, as the twist angle determines the electron bandwidth and correlation strength in the moire system. Here, we report the observation of unexpected competing magnetic ground states in tMoTe2 moire superlattice, on which balance can be tipped by both twist angle and electric field (E). Specifically, we observed anomalous antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground states with zero Hall resistance at both v_h=1 and 2/3, at intermediate twist angles ~3deg. The AFM orders are suppressed by applying vertical E, and emergent ferromagnetism accompanied by integer Chern insulator (ICI) or fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states are observed near the critical E (E_c) of moire superlattice symmetry transition. Our results demonstrate tMoTe2 as a fascinating platform for exploring unexpected correlated phases with nontrivial topology and fractional excitations and point to electric-field-controlled ultralow-power spin-valleytronic devices.

Title: Dynamics of one-dimensional spin models via complex-time evolution of tensor networks
Authors: Jeong Hyeok Cha, Hyun-Yong Lee, Heung-Sik Kim
Abstract: Studying the real-time dynamics of strongly correlated systems poses significant challenges, which have recently become more manageable thanks to advances in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and tensor network methods. A notable development in this area is the introduction of a complex-time evolution scheme for tensor network states, originally suggested for solving Anderson impurity model and designed to suppress the growth of entanglement under time evolution. In this study, we employ the complex-time evolution scheme to investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional spin systems, specifically the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and the XXZ model. Our analysis revisits the dynamic critical exponent $z$ of the TFIM and explores the dynamical structure factor in both gapped and gapless states of the XXZ model. Importantly, the complex-time evolution reproduces the results of real-time evolution while mitigating the rapid growth of quantum entanglement typically associated with the latter. These results demonstrate that the combination of complex-time evolution and extrapolation provides a robust and efficient framework for studying the dynamics of complex quantum systems, enabling more comprehensive insights into their behavior.

Title: Experiments and modeling of mechanically-soft, hard magnetorheological foams with potential applications in haptic sensing
Authors: Zehui Lin, Zahra Hooshmand-Ahoor, Laurence Bodelot, Kostas Danas
Abstract: This study proposes a family of novel mechanically-soft and magnetically-hard magnetorheological foams that, upon deformation, lead to robust and measurable magnetic flux changes in their surroundings. This allows to infer qualitatively and even quantitatively the imposed deformation and, eventually from that, an estimation of the stiffness and average stress on the sample even in complex loading scenarios involving combinations of uniform or nonuniform compression/tension with superposed shearing in different directions. The work provides a complete experimental, theoretical and numerical framework on finite strain, compressible magneto-elasticity, thereby allowing to measure and predict coupled magneto-mechanical properties of such materials with different particle volume fractions and then use it to estimate and design potential haptic sensing devices.

Title: Magnetic polarons due to spin-length fluctuations in $\boldsymbol{d}^\mathbf{4}$ spin-orbit Mott systems
Authors: Jan Revenda, Krzysztof Wohlfeld, Jiří Chaloupka
Abstract: Mott insulators based on $4d$ and $5d$ transition-metal ions, where spin-orbit interaction plays a key role, can exhibit various forms of unusual magnetism. A particular example is the antiferromagnet Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ containing $d^4$ Ru$^{4+}$ ions. Here the spin-orbit interaction stabilizes the non-magnetic $J=0$ singlet ionic ground state, which gets dynamically mixed - via exchange interactions - with low-energy $J=1$ ionic excitations. Thanks to a sufficient strength of the exchange, these excitations condense and a long-range order emerges. The resulting ordered moments are soft and prone to fluctuations of their effective length. The corresponding amplitude mode appears as a prominent magnetic excitation and complements the conventional magnons involving rotations of the moments. Motivated by this peculiar kind of magnetic order and the specific spectrum of magnetic excitations, we study their influence on the propagation of doped carriers. To this end, we construct a microscopic model including both $d^4$ and $d^5$ degrees of freedom and address the propagation of an injected electron by employing self-consistent Born approximation. We find that the electron shows a combination of both free and a polaronic type of motion, where the mobile carrier strongly interacts with an accompanying cloud of magnetic excitations. Remarkably, in the latter case it is the exotic excitation - the amplitude mode - that is found to dominate over the contribution of magnons. Our soft-spin situation thus largely contrasts with spin polarons widely discussed in the context of doped Heisenberg-like magnets based on rigid spin moments.

Title: DC-driven separation of fractional flux quanta in two-band superconductors
Authors: Anton O. Pokusinskyi, Oleksandr V. Dobrovolskiy
Abstract: Two-band superconductors host vortices from superfluid condensates of different electron bands. These vortices carry a fractional flux quantum and attract each other, coalescing to form a composite vortex with the whole flux quantum $\phi_0$. However, due to the differences in viscosity and flux of the vortices across different bands, composite vortices may dissociate into fractional components. Here, we theoretically explore an approach to control the dissociation of composite vortices into fractional components and their separation into stationary and fast-moving ones through dc current and pinning strength variation. To this end, we numerically solve the dynamic equation of motion for a single dc-driven composite vortex in a periodic pinning potential. As the pinning strength increases, we observe a transition from depinning followed by dissociation in the weak-pinning regime to dissociation from the pinned state in the strong-pinning regime. Under moderately strong pinning, fractional vortices from one condensate may become immobile while those from the other may even move faster than the original composite vortex just before the dissociation. The predicted pinning- and dc-controlled separation of fractional flux quanta appeals for experimental investigation and potential application in fluxonic devices.

Title: The possible frustrated superconductivity in the kagome superconductors
Authors: Hong-Min Jiang, Wen-Qian Dong, Shun-Li Yu, Z. D. Wang
Abstract: Geometric frustration has long been a subject of enduring interest in condensed matter physics. While geometric frustration traditionally focuses on magnetic systems, little attention is paid to the "frustrated superconductivity" which could arise when the superconducting interaction conflicts with the crystal symmetry. The recently discovered kagome superconductors provide a particular opportunity for studying this due to the fact that the frustrated lattice structure and the interference effect between the three sublattices can facilitate the frustrated superconducting interaction. Here, we propose a theory that supports the frustrated superconducting state, derived from the on-site $s$-wave superconducting pairing in conjunction with the nearest-neighbor pairings hoping and the unique geometrical frustrated lattice structure. In this state, whereas the mutual $2\pi/3$ difference of the superconducting pairing phase causes the six-fold modulation of the amplitude and breaks the time-reversal symmetry with $4\pi$ phase changes of the superconducting pairing as one following it around the Fermi surface, it is immune to the impurities without the impurity-induced in-gap states and produces the pronounced Hebel-Slichter peak of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate below $T_{c}$. Notably, the theory also reveals a disorder-induced superconducting pairing transition from the frustrated superconducting state to an isotropic $s$-wave superconducting state without traversing the nodal points, recovering and explaining the behavior found in experiment. This study not only serves as a promising proposal to mediate the divergent or seemingly contradictory experimental outcomes regarding superconducting pairing symmetry, but may also pave the way for advancing investigations into the frustrated superconducting state.

Title: Altermagnetic type-II Multiferroics with Néel-order-locked Electric Polarization
Authors: Wen-Ti Guo, Junqi Xu, Yurong Yang, Huaiqiang Wang, Haijun Zhang
Abstract: Altermagnetism, an emergent magnetic phase featuring compensated collinear magnetic moments and momentum-dependent spin splittings, has recently garnered widespread interest. A critical issue concerns whether the unconventional spin structures can generate spontaneous electric polarization in altermagnets, thereby achieving type-II multiferroicity. Here, with the combination of symmetry analysis and microscopic theory, we explicitly demonstrate the generation of electric polarization by altermagnetic Néel order, and establish a microscopic mechanism of Néel-order-locked electric polarization in altermagnetic multiferroics.~We further reveal these pronounced magnetoelectric coupling behaviors and classify them into eight distinct categories for two-dimensional altermagnets governed by layer group symmetries. Then we take monolayer MgFe$_2$N$_2$ as a prototypical example of altermagnetic type-II multiferroics by first-principles calculations. We also propose to identify the Néel order and accompanying electric polarization in altermagnetic multiferroics by magneto-optical microscopy. Bridging type-II multiferroics and altermagnets, our work could pave the way for altermagnetic multifunctional spintronics.

Title: Machine Learning Tool to Analyse Spectroscopic Changes in High-Dimensional Data
Authors: Alberto Martinez-Serra, Gionni Marchetti, Francesco D'Amico, Ivana Fenoglio, Barbara Rossi, Marco P. Monopoli, Giancarlo Franzese
Abstract: When nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into a biological solution, layers of biomolecules form on their surface, creating a corona. Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology. However, the influence of NP properties on protein conformation is not well understood. In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen, a crucial protein in human blood plasma, at physiological concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method offers a quantitative analysis of protein structural changes upon adsorption and enhances the understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.

Title: Toward Efficient Electrokinetic Energy Conversion with Topographic Modulation of Electrical Conduction
Authors: Austin Dick, Kushal Iyyapareddy, Aktaruzzaman Al Hossain, Carlos E. Colosqui
Abstract: This work presents experimental and theoretical analyses of electrokinetic flow in microchannels with glass and silica surfaces across a broad range of electrolyte concentrations (0.01 to 100 mM). We demonstrate simple but effective strategies for controlling electrical conduction by engineering nanoscale and microscale topographic features that directly modify the structure and extent of the electric double layer (EDL) and the interfacial ion conduction pathway. These tailored surface topographies modulate the overall electrical conductivity in slit microchannels through similar phenomena documented for nanochannels and nanopores due to the presence of liquid-filled nanoscale topographic features with high concentration of highly mobile protons. The findings of this work reveal that the interaction between tailored surface features and the EDL can substantially enhance energy conversion efficiency in microscale systems. These insights along with simple analytical models provide guidance for the rational design and optimization of scalable electrokinetic devices and are broadly relevant to numerous energy harvesting and charge-separation technologies.

Title: Plastic deformation as a phase transition: a combinatorial model of plastic flow in copper single crystals
Authors: Afonso D. M. Barroso, Elijah Borodin, Andrey P. Jivkov
Abstract: Continuum models of plasticity fail to capture the richness of microstructural evolution because the continuum is a homogeneous construction. The present study shows that an alternative way is available at the mesoscale in the form of truly discrete constructions and in the discrete exterior calculus. A pre-existing continuum mean-field model with two parameters is rewritten in the language of the latter to model the properties of a network of plastic slip events in a perfect copper single crystal under uniaxial tension. The behaviour of the system is simulated in a triangular 2D mesh in 3D space employing a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Phases of distinct character emerge and both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed. The phases can be interpreted as representing crystallographic phenomena like cross-slip, strain localisation and partial dislocations. The first-order transitions mostly occur as functions of the applied stress, while the second-order transitions occur exclusively as functions of the mean-field coupling parameter. The former are reminiscent of transitions in other statistical-mechanical models, while the latter find parallels in experimental observations.

Title: Eigenstate Thermalization in the Two-Site SYK and SYK Chain Models
Authors: Seyyed M.H. Halataei
Abstract: A recent study of Rényi entanglement entropy in the SYK chain of Majorana fermions suggested that the model does not rapidly thermalize, despite being maximally chaotic. In this work, I examine the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for both the SYK chain and the two-site SYK models using exact diagonalization. I show that single realizations of both models approximately satisfy ETH conditions, while ensemble averages strictly satisfy ETH. Therefore, I conclude that the finite-size SYK chain and two-site SYK models can rapidly thermalize with respect to generic few-body operators through the ETH mechanism. This suggests that the subthermal behavior observed in previous studies of Rényi entanglement entropy does not manifest in finite-size systems, and that these systems can thermalize rapidly via their light modes. It also indicates that the proposed gravitational dual may undergo rapid thermalization.

Title: Floquet engineering using pulse driving in a diamond two-level system under a large-amplitude modulation
Authors: Shunsuke Nishimura, Kohei M. Itoh, Junko Ishi-Hayase, Kento Sasaki, Kensuke Kobayashi
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in a diamond is a promising platform for Floquet engineering. Using the synchronized readout, we investigate the NV center's Floquet state driven by the Carr-Purcell sequence in a large-amplitude AC magnetic field. We observe the dynamics represented as Bessel functions up to 211th orders high in a systematic and quantitative agreement with the theoretical model. Furthermore, numerical calculations show that the effect of finite pulse duration and error limits the modulation amplitude available for Floquet engineering. This work provides an approach to precisely investigate Floquet engineering, showing the extendable range of modulation amplitude for two-level systems.

Title: Edge modes and symmetry-protected topological states in open quantum systems
Authors: Dawid Paszko, Dominic C. Rose, Marzena H. Szymańska, Arijeet Pal
Abstract: Topological order offers possibilities for processing quantum information which can be immune to imperfections. However, the question of its stability out of equilibrium is relevant for experiments, where coupling to an environment is unavoidable. In this work we demonstrate the robustness of certain aspects of $Z_2 \times Z_2$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order against a wide class of dissipation channels in the Lindblad and quantum trajectory formalisms of an open quantum system. This is illustrated using the one-dimensional $ZXZ$ cluster Hamiltonian along with Pauli-string jump operators. We show that certain choices of dissipation retaining strong symmetries support a steady-state manifold consisting of two non-local logical qubits, and for Hamiltonian perturbations preserving the global symmetry, states in this manifold remain metastable. In contrast, this metastability is destroyed upon breaking the above-mentioned symmetry. While the localized edge qubits of the cluster Hamiltonian are not conserved by the Lindbladian evolution, they do correspond to weak symmetries and thus retain a memory of their initial state at all times in the quantum trajectories. We utilize this feature to construct protocols to retrieve the quantum information either by monitoring jumps or error mitigation. Our work thus proposes a novel framework to study the dynamics of dissipative SPT phases and opens the possibility of engineering entangled states relevant to quantum information processing.

Title: Investigations of optical aberration on quantum diamond microscopy toward high spatial resolution and sensitivity
Authors: Shunsuke Nishimura, Moeta Tsukamoto, Kento Sasaki, Kensuke Kobayashi
Abstract: Quantum diamond microscopy (QDM), which employs nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles, is a promising approach to quantitatively imaging magnetic fields with both high resolution that approaches the diffraction limit and a wide field of view. The commonly adopted setups of QDM capture the photoluminescence through transparent diamonds, which inevitably entail aberrations -- optical errors that degrade the optical resolution and contrast of the obtainable image. In this study, we delve into the impact of optical aberrations, focusing on their dependence on diamond thickness. We first introduce a rigorous model [Richards et al., Braat et al.] of diffraction that incorporates aberrations, producing the NV center optical image. We confirm that this model accurately reproduces the confocal images of single NV centers obtained at various depths in diamonds. Extending this model to a wide-field microscope, we find that the model also accurately reproduces the USAF 1951 resolution test chart obtained through diamonds of various thicknesses. Based on these investigations, we quantitatively assess the consequent resolution constraints and propose thinning the diamond as a viable solution. We present a robust method to quantitatively ascertain resolution in optical systems influenced by aberrations caused by ray transmission through diamonds. For instance, for a typical microscope with an objective lens of NA = 0.7, the diffraction limit is achievable through diamonds that are 30 {\mu}m thick, and a resolution of 1 {\mu}m is obtained through diamonds that are 100 {\mu}m thick. Those results opens up avenues for enhanced performance in QDM. The Julia package used to calculate the vectorial PSFs is available at this http URL.

Title: Coherent heat transfer leads to genuine quantum enhancement in the performances of continuous engines
Authors: Brij Mohan, Rajeev Gangwar, Tanmoy Pandit, Mohit Lal Bera, Maciej Lewenstein, Manabendra Nath Bera
Abstract: Conventional continuous quantum heat engines with incoherent heat transfer perform poorly as they exploit two-body interactions between the system and hot or cold baths, thus having limited capability to outperform their classical counterparts. We introduce distinct continuous quantum heat engines that utilize coherent heat transfer with baths, yielding genuine quantum enhancement in performance. These coherent engines consist of one qutrit system and two photonic baths and enable coherent heat transfer via two-photon transitions involving three-body interactions between the system and hot and cold baths. We demonstrate that coherent engines deliver significantly higher power output with much greater reliability, i.e., lower signal-to-noise ratio of the power, by hundreds of folds over their incoherent counterparts. Importantly, coherent engines can operate close to or at the maximal achievable reliability allowed by the quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Moreover, coherent engines manifest more nonclassical features than incoherent engines because they violate the classical thermodynamic uncertainty relation by a greater amount and for a wider range of parameters. These genuine enhancements in the performance of coherent engines are directly attributed to their capacity to harness higher energetic coherence for the resonant driving case. The experimental feasibility of coherent engines and the improved understanding of how quantum properties can enhance performance may find applications in quantum-enabled technologies.

Title: Quantum Dynamics in Krylov Space: Methods and Applications
Authors: Pratik Nandy, Apollonas S. Matsoukas-Roubeas, Pablo Martínez-Azcona, Anatoly Dymarsky, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems unfolds within a subspace of the state space or operator space, known as the Krylov space. This review presents the use of Krylov subspace methods to provide an efficient description of quantum evolution and quantum chaos, with emphasis on nonequilibrium phenomena of many-body systems with a large Hilbert space. It provides a comprehensive update of recent developments, focused on the quantum evolution of operators in the Heisenberg picture as well as pure and mixed states. It further explores the notion of Krylov complexity and associated metrics as tools for quantifying operator growth, their bounds by generalized quantum speed limits, the universal operator growth hypothesis, and its relation to quantum chaos, scrambling, and generalized coherent states. A comparison of several generalizations of the Krylov construction for open quantum systems is presented. A closing discussion addresses the application of Krylov subspace methods in quantum field theory, holography, integrability, quantum control, and quantum computing, as well as current open problems.

Title: Simulation of the 1d XY model on a quantum computer
Authors: Marc Farreras, Alba Cervera-Lierta
Abstract: The field of quantum computing has grown fast in recent years, both in theoretical advancements and the practical construction of quantum computers. These computers were initially proposed, among other reasons, to efficiently simulate and comprehend the complexities of quantum physics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive scheme for the exact simulation of the 1-D XY model on a quantum computer. We successfully diagonalize the proposed Hamiltonian, enabling access to the complete energy spectrum. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to design a quantum circuit to perform exact time evolution. Among all the possibilities this opens, we compute the ground and excited state energies for the symmetric XY model with spin chains of $n=4$ and $n=8$ spins. Further, we calculate the expected value of transverse magnetization for the ground state in the transverse Ising model. Both studies allow the observation of a quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state. Additionally, we have simulated the time evolution of the state all spins up in the transverse Ising model. The scalability and high performance of our algorithm make it an ideal candidate for benchmarking purposes, while also laying the foundation for simulating other integrable models on quantum computers.

Title: Biased Degenerate Ground-State Sampling of Small Ising Models with Converged QAOA
Authors: Elijah Pelofske
Abstract: The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, a generalization of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), is a quantum algorithm used for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA typically uses the Transverse field mixer as the driving Hamiltonian. One of the interesting properties of the Transverse-field driving Hamiltonian is that it results in non-uniform sampling of degenerate ground states of optimization problems. In this study we numerically examine the fair sampling properties transverse field mixer QAOA, and Grover Mixer QAOA (GM-QAOA) which provides theoretical guarantees of fair sampling of degenerate optimal solutions, up to large enough $p$ such that the mean expectation value converges to an optimal approximation ratio of $1$. This comparison is performed with high quality heuristically computed, but not necessarily optimal, QAOA angles which give strictly monotonically improving solution quality as p increases. These angles are computed using the Julia based numerical simulation software JuliQAOA. Fair sampling of degenerate ground-states is quantified using Shannon entropy of the ground-state amplitudes distribution. The fair sampling properties are reported on several quantum signature Hamiltonians from previous quantum annealing fair sampling studies. Small random fully connected spin glasses are shown which exhibit exponential suppression of some degenerate ground-states with transverse field mixer QAOA. The transverse field mixer QAOA simulations show that some problem instances clearly saturate the Shannon entropy of $0$ with a maximally biased distribution that occurs when the learning converges to an approximation ratio of $1$ while other problem instances never deviate from a maximum Shannon entropy (uniform distribution) at any $p$ step.

Title: Global well-posedness in a Hartree-Fock model for graphene
Authors: William Borrelli, Umberto Morellini
Abstract: Graphene is a monolayer graphitic film in which electrons behave like two-dimensional Dirac fermions without mass. Its study has attracted a wide interest in the domain of condensed matter physics. In particular, it represents an ideal system to test the comprehension of 2D massless relativistic particles in a laboratory, the Fermi velocity being 300 times smaller than the speed of light. In this work, we present a global well-posedness result for graphene in the Hartree- Fock approximation. The model allows to describe the time evolution of graphene in the presence of external time-dependent electric potentials, such as those induced by local charge defects in the monolayer of carbon atoms. Our approach is based on a well established non-perturbative framework originating from the study of three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics.

Title: Power Law Behavior in the Spatial and Frequency Domain Governing Thermal Slip at a Liquid/Solid Interface
Authors: Hiroki Kaifu, Sandra M. Troian
Abstract: Integrated chips for power intensive graphics and computer processing applications dissipate so much heat nowadays that liquid based cooling has become practically essential to prevent breakdown from thermal runaway. Fortunately, cooling schemes based on immersion technology or microfluidic networks are proving effective. However, further progress ultimately requires tackling the intrinsic thermal impedance caused by the discontinuity in properties across the liquid/solid (L/S) interface. Since experimental tools still lack sufficient spatiotemporal resolution for this purpose and given there are no analytic models for phonon propagation across the L/S interface, researchers have come to rely heavily on non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. The goal of this computational study was to determine whether there exist compact general equations for the thermal slip length based on correlated behavior in the L/S contact zone. The results reveal power law equations for the thermal slip length incorporating the influence of molecular interaction parameters, local temperature, long range translational order and peak vibrational frequencies. These findings offer a promising route forward directed at the influence of surface localized phonons in the L/S contact zone.

Title: Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge
Authors: Zhiyuan Wang
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.

Title: What is a chemostat? Insights from hybrid dynamics and stochastic thermodynamics
Authors: Benedikt Remlein, Massimiliano Esposito, Francesco Avanzini
Abstract: At the microscopic scale, open chemical reaction networks are described by stochastic reactions that follow mass-action kinetics and are coupled to chemostats. We show that closed chemical reaction networks -- with specific stoichiometries imposed by mass-action kinetics -- behave like open ones in the limit where the abundances of a subset of species become macroscopic, thus playing the role of chemostats. We prove that this limit is thermodynamically consistent by recovering the local detailed balance condition of open chemical reaction networks and deriving the proper expression of the entropy production rate. In particular, the entropy production rate features two contributions: one accounting for the dissipation of the stochastic reactions, the other for the dissipation of continuous reactions controlling the chemostats. Finally, we illustrate our results for two prototypical examples.

Title: Higher order tacnodes in a free fermionic model
Authors: Andrea Maroncelli, Jean-Marie Stéphan
Abstract: We investigate a free fermion model with nearest and next-nearest neighbor hopping, evolving in imaginary time from a product state with N consecutive fermions, and conditioned to go back to the same state after a given time. In the case of nearest neighbor hoppings, this model is known to give rise to limit shapes and arctic curves for large time and fermion number, with in particular two fluctuating regions which can be tuned to merge depending on ratio between time and N. Fluctuations near the merger are governed by a so-called tacnode kernel. In this paper we study the analogous picture in the presence of a next nearest interactions. In particular, we discuss the limit shapes, and compute analytically the corresponding density profile. We also study the behavior of correlations close to the merger point, and find a novel higher order tacnode kernel governing them.

Title: Universal fault tolerant quantum computation in 2D without getting tied in knots
Authors: Margarita Davydova, Andreas Bauer, Julio C. Magdalena de la Fuente, Mark Webster, Dominic J. Williamson, Benjamin J. Brown
Abstract: We show how to perform scalable fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates in two dimensions by introducing domain walls between the surface code and a non-Abelian topological code whose codespace is stabilized by Clifford operators. We formulate a path integral framework which provides both a macroscopic picture for different logical gates as well as a way to derive the associated microscopic circuits. We also show an equivalence between our approach and prior proposals where a 2D array of qubits reproduces the action of a transversal gate in a 3D stabilizer code over time, thus, establishing a new connection between 3D codes and 2D non-Abelian topological phases. We prove a threshold theorem for our protocols under local stochastic circuit noise using a just-in-time decoder to correct the non-Abelian code.

Title: Non-invertible symmetries of two-dimensional Non-Linear Sigma Models
Authors: Guillermo Arias-Tamargo, Chris Hull, Maxwell L. Velásquez Cotini Hutt
Abstract: Global symmetries can be generalised to transformations generated by topological operators, including cases in which the topological operator does not have an inverse. A family of such topological operators are intimately related to dualities via the procedure of half-space gauging. In this work we discuss the construction of non-invertible defects based on T-duality in two dimensions, generalising the well-known case of the free compact boson to any Non-Linear Sigma Model with Wess-Zumino term which is T-dualisable. This requires that the target space has an isometry with compact orbits that acts without fixed points. Our approach allows us to include target spaces without non-trivial 1-cycles, does not require the NLSM to be conformal, and when it is conformal it does not need to be rational; moreover, it highlights the microscopic origin of the topological terms that are responsible for the non-invertibility of the defect. An interesting class of examples are Wess-Zumino-Witten models, which are self-dual under a discrete gauging of a subgroup of the isometry symmetry and so host a topological defect line with Tambara-Yamagami fusion. Along the way, we discuss how the usual 0-form symmetries match across T-dual models in target spaces without 1-cycles, and how global obstructions can prevent locally conserved currents from giving rise to topological operators.

Title: Understanding Decoherence of the Boron Vacancy Center in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: András Tárkányi, Viktor Ivády
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a significant material for quantum sensing, particularly due to its ability to host spin active defects, such as the negatively charged boron vacancy (V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center). The optical addressability of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center and hBN's 2D structure enable high spatial resolution and integration into various platforms. However, decoherence due to the strong magnetic noise in hBN imposes fundamental limitations on the sensitivity of V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center-based applications. Understanding the phenomena behind decoherence and identifying parameter settings that provide the highest performance are essential for advancing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ sensors. This study employs state-of-the-art computational methods to investigate the decoherence of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center in hexagonal boron nitride across a wide range of magnetic field values from 0 T up to 3 T. The provided in-depth numerical and analytical analysis reveals an intricate interplay of various decoherence mechanisms. This study identifies five distinct magnetic field regions governed by different types of magnetic interactions with and within the abundant nuclear spin bath. In addition to magnetic field, the effects of zero-field splitting, nuclear polarization, and different hyperfine coupling terms are studied, representing an important step forward in utilizing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles in sensing. In particular, this study proposes operation in the moderate $180-350$ mT magnetic field range in chemically pure h$^{11}$B$^{15}$N samples, where the coherence time can reach $1-20$ $\mu$s, significantly exceeding the $\mathcal{O}( 100~\text{ns})$ low-field $T_2$ values.

Title: Production-ready double-side fabrication of dual-band infrared meta-optics using deep-UV lithography
Authors: Kai Sun, Xingzhao Yan, Jordan Scott, Jun-Yu Ou, James N. Monks, Otto L. Muskens
Abstract: Meta-optics, the application of metasurfaces into optical systems, is seeing an accelerating development owing to advantages in size, weight and cost and the ability to program optical functions beyond traditional refractive optics. The transition of meta-optics from the laboratory into applications is enabled by scalable production methods based on highly reproducible semiconductor process technology. Here, we introduce a novel method for fabrication of double-sided metasurfaces through deep-UV lithography as a production-ready method for achieving high-quality meta-optics. We achieve patterning of a silicon wafer on both sides with mutual alignment of around 25 $\mu$m based on tool accuracy, without requiring through-wafer alignment markers other than the wafer notch. A first novel application highlighting the benefits of double-sided design is demonstrated in the form of a dual-band metalens with independent control over focal lengths in mid- and long-wave infrared bands. Using multi-reticle stitching we demonstrate a 40 mm diameter, large-area metalens with excellent broadband imaging performance, showing partial cancelling of chromatic dispersion when used in a hybrid configuration with a BaF$_2$ refractive lens. Our work opens new avenues for infrared meta-optics designs and double-side meta-optics fabrication through a production-ready technique which can be directly translated into scalable technology for real-world applications.
