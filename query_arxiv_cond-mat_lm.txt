Title: The Saga of $α$-RuCl$_3$: Parameters, Models, and Phase Diagrams
Authors: Marius Möller, P. A. Maksimov, Shengtao Jiang, Steven R. White, Roser Valenti, A. L. Chernyshev
Abstract: RuCl$_3$ was likely the first ever deliberately synthesized ruthenium compound, following the discovery of the $_{44}$Ru element in 1844. For a long time it was known as an oxidation catalyst, with its physical properties being discrepant and confusing, until a decade ago when its allotropic form $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rose to exceptional prominence. This "re-discovery" of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has not only reshaped the hunt for a material manifestation of the Kitaev spin liquid, but it has opened the floodgates of theoretical and experimental research in the many unusual phases and excitations that the anisotropic-exchange magnets as a class of compounds have to offer. Given its importance for the field of Kitaev materials, it is astonishing that the low-energy spin model that describes this compound and its possible proximity to the much-desired spin-liquid state is still a subject of significant debate ten years later. In the present study, we argue that the existing key phenomenological observations put strong natural constraints on the effective microscopic spin model of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and specifically on its spin-orbit-induced anisotropic-exchange parameters that are responsible for the non-trivial physical properties of this material. These constraints allow one to focus on the relevant region of the multi-dimensional phase diagram of the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ model, suggest an intuitive description of it via a different parametrization of the exchange matrix, offer a unifying view on the earlier assessments of its parameters, and bring closer together several approaches to the derivation of anisotropic-exchange models. We explore extended phase diagrams relevant to the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ parameter space using quasi-classical, Luttinger-Tisza, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix renormalization group methods, demonstrating a remarkably c...

Title: Extended strange metal regime from superconducting puddles
Authors: Noga Bashan, Evyatar Tulipman, Steven A. Kivelson, Jörg Schmalian, Erez Berg
Abstract: We study a model of mesoscale superconducting puddles in a metal, represented as dynamical impurities interacting with a finite number of electronic channels via Andreev and normal scattering. We identify conditions under which the collection of puddles make a $T$-linear contribution to the resistivity and a $T\ln(1/T)$ to the specific heat and thermopower. This behavior emerges in an intermediate temperature range that extends from an upper energy scale set by the renormalized charging energy of the puddles, and down to an exponentially small scale associated with a charge-Kondo crossover, provided that the number of electronic channels interacting with the puddle is large. The phenomenology of our model resembles the apparent extended strange metal regime observed in overdoped cuprates which exhibits $T$-linear resistivity at low $T$ over a finite range of doping. We also propose to engineer a strange metal from suitably designed superconducting grains in a metallic matrix.

Title: Kekulé Spiral Order from Strained Topological Heavy Fermions
Authors: Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Dumitru Călugăru, Haoyu Hu, Jiabin Yu, Nicolas Regnault, Jian Kang, B. Andrei Bernevig, Oskar Vafek
Abstract: The topological heavy fermion (THF) model of twisted bilayer graphene is a framework for treating its strongly interacting topological flat bands. In this work, we employ the THF model with heterostrain and particle-hole symmetry breaking corrections to study its symmetry-broken ground states. We find that the heterostrain correction motivates a specific parent-state wavefunction which dictates the presence or absence of an incommensurate Kekulé spiral (IKS) at each integer filling by invoking Dirac node braiding and annihilation as a mechanism to achieve low energy gapped states. We then show that one-shot Hartree-Fock faithfully replicates the numerical results of fully self-consistent states and motivates an analytical approximation for the IKS wavevector. We can also account for the particle-hole asymmetry in the correlated insulator gaps. In particular, the THF model predicts stronger correlated states on the electron side rather than hole side in agreement with magic angle experiments, despite the electron side being more dispersive in the single-particle band structure. This work demonstrates that we can analytically explain even the more subtle symmetry breaking order properties observed in experiments where heterostrain, relaxation, and interactions together determine the ground state.

Title: Absorbing state transitions with discrete symmetries
Authors: Hyunsoo Ha, David A. Huse, Rhine Samajdar
Abstract: Recent progress in interactive quantum dynamics has inspired the study of fundamentally out-of-equilibrium dynamical phase transitions of quantum and classical many-body systems. Motivated by these developments, we study nonequilibrium phase transitions to absorbing states in one-dimensional systems that can model certain quantum circuits. Specifically, we consider dynamics for which the absorbing states are not unique due to a discrete symmetry: Z2 for two-state models and S3 or Z3 for three-state models. Under time evolution, domain walls in these models perform random walks and coarsen under local feedback, which, if perfect, reduces their number over time, driving the system to an absorbing state in polynomial time. Imperfect feedback, however, introduces domain wall multiplication (branching), potentially leading to an active phase. For Z2-symmetric two-state models, starting from a single domain wall, we find distinct absorbing and active phases as in previous studies. Extending this analysis to local three-state models shows that any nonzero branching rate drives the system into the active phase. However, we demonstrate that incorporating nonlocal classical information into the feedback can stabilize the absorbing phase against branching. By tuning the level of nonlocality, we observe a transition from the active to the absorbing phase, which belongs to a new universality class.

Title: Phonon-mediated spin-polarized superconductivity in altermagnets
Authors: Kristoffer Leraand, Kristian Mæland, Asle Sudbø
Abstract: We consider the possibility of phonon-mediated unconventional superconductivity in a recently discovered new class of antiferromagnets, dubbed altermagnets. Within a weak-coupling approach, and using a minimal Lieb lattice model for altermagnets, we find a dominant superconducting instability odd in momentum and even in spin with spin-polarized Cooper pairs. We discuss the origin of this unusual result in terms of the spin-structure of the altermagnetic Fermi surface, in combination with the momentum-space structure of the effective phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions on the Fermi surface.

Title: Dual view of the Z$_2$-Gauged XY Model in 3D
Authors: Piers Coleman, Anatoly Kuklov, Alexei Tsvelik
Abstract: The $Z_2$ gauged neutral XY model is of long-standing interest both in the context of nematic order, and the study of fractionalization and superconductivity. This paper presents heuristic arguments that no deconfinement of the XY field occurs in this model and presents results of a large-scale Monte Carlo simulations on a cubic lattice which are consistent with this conclusion. The correlation radius determining the confinement is found to be growing rapidly as a function of the parameters in the phase featuring the nematic order. Thus, mesoscopic properties of the system can mimic deconfinement with high accuracy in some part of the phase diagram.

Title: Tuning electrochemical properties and thermal stability of YSZ mesoporous thin films for SOFC applications
Authors: Bernardo Sievers, Leticia Granja, Andrés Zelcer, Dilson Juan, Valeria Ferrari, Sebastián Passanante, Verónica Lombardo, María Cecilia Fuertes, Rodolfo Oscar Fuentes, Joaquín Sacanell
Abstract: Dense and mesoporous 4% mol Yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films were deposited on amorphous silica substrates. The effects of the temperature on the mesostructure were analyzed, by applying different thermal treatments to the samples within the range of SOFC operation conditions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements rendered evidence of a single mechanism, consistent with grain boundary/surface oxide ion conduction. Our results show that the presence of the highly accessible porosity improves the superficial ionic conductivity, reducing the activation energy of the overall process. Density functional theory calculations on the (110) surface were performed to estimate the associated energy barriers. Our results suggest that ionic transport along the surface of accessible pores connected to the atmosphere could account for the observed reduction in activation energy.

Title: Designing Flat Bands, Localized and Itinerant States in TaS2 Trilayer Heterostructures
Authors: Hyeonhu Bae, Roser Valenti, Igor I. Mazin, Binghai Yan
Abstract: Stacking and twisting van der Waals materials provide a powerful tool to design quantum matter and engineer electron correlation. For instance, monolayers of 1T- and 1H-TaS2 are Mott insulating and metallic (also superconducting), respectively, and thus, the T/H bilayer systems have been extensively investigated in the context of heavy fermions and unconventional superconductivity, which are expected phases from localized spins (1T) coexisting with itinerant electrons (1H). However, recent studies revealed that significant charge transfer from the 1T to 1H layers removes the 1T Mottness and renders the above scenario elusive. In this work, we propose a T/T/H trilayer heterostructure by combining a T/T bilayer -- which is a band insulator with flat dispersion -- with a 1H layer. After charge redistribution, this trilayer heterostructure shows localized spins in the Mott flat band of the T/T bilayer and weak spin polarization in the metallic H layer. We argue that by varying the stacking configurations of the T/T bilayer in the T/T/H trilayer, a crossover from a doped Mott insulator to a Kondo insulator can be achieved. The T/T/H trilayer provides therefore a rich novel heterostructure platform to study strong correlation phenomena and unconventional superconductivity.

Title: A Map of the Zintl AM2Pn2 Compounds: Influence of Chemistry on Stability and Electronic Structure
Authors: Andrew Pike, Zhenkun Yuan, Gideon Kassa, Muhammad R Hasan, Smitakshi Goswami, Sita Dugu, Shaham Quadir, Andriy Zakutayev, Sage Bauers, Kirill Kovnir, Jifeng Liu, Geoffroy Hautier
Abstract: The AM2Pn2 (A= Ca, Sr, Ba, Yb, Mg; M= Mn, Zn, Cd, Mg; and Pn=N, P, As, Sb, Bi) family of Zintl phases has been known as thermoelectric materials and has recently gained much attention for highly promising materials for solar absorbers in single junction and tandem solar cells. In this paper we will, from first-principles, explore the entire family of AM2Pn2 compounds in terms of their ground state structure, thermodynamic stability, and electronic structure. We also perform photoluminescence spectroscopy on bulk powder and thin film samples to verify our results, including the first measurements of the bandgaps of SrCd2P2 and CaCd2P2. The AM2Pn2 compounds exhibit broad stability, are mostly isostructural in the CaAl2Si2-type structure (P3m1), and cover a wide range of bandgaps from 0 to beyond 3 eV. This could make them useful for a variety of purposes, for which we propose several candidates, such as CaZn2N2 for tandem top cell solar absorbers and SrCd2Sb2 and CaZn2Sb2 for infrared detectors. By examining the band structures of the AM2Pn2, we find that Mg3Sb2 has the most promise as a thermoelectric material due to several off-{\Gamma} valence band pockets which are unique to it among the compositions studied here.

Title: Effects of altermagnetic order, strain and doping on the optical and vibrational properties of RuO$_2$
Authors: Darshana Wickramaratne, Marc Currie, Shelby S. Fields, Cory D. Cress, Steven P. Bennett
Abstract: RuO$_2$, one of the most widely studied transition metal oxides, was recently predicted to host a novel form of collinear magnetic order referred to as altermagnetism. In this study we combine experiment (reflectance, transmittance, ellipsometry and Raman measurements) and first-principles calculations to elucidate the potential role of altermagnetic order, strain and doping on the optical and vibrational properties of RuO$_2$ grown on TiO$_2$ (001), (101) and (110) substrates. The combination of experiment and theory in this study surprisingly indicates RuO$_2$ is in fact best described if one assumes the nonmagnetic state. Calculations of the altermagnetic state leads to poor agreement with the measured optical and vibrational properties of RuO$_2$.

Title: Anisotropic Strain Relaxation-Induced Directional Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics in RuO2 Films
Authors: S. G. Jeong, I. H. Choi, S. Lee, J. Y. Oh, S. Nair, J. H. Lee, C. Kim, A. Seo, W. S. Choi, T. Low, J. S. Lee, B. Jalan
Abstract: Ultrafast light-matter interactions inspire potential functionalities in picosecond optoelectronic applications. However, achieving directional carrier dynamics in metals remains challenging due to strong carrier scattering within a multiband environment, typically expected to isotropic carrier relaxation. In this study, we demonstrate epitaxial RuO2/TiO2 (110) heterostructures grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy to engineer polarization-selectivity of ultrafast light-matter interactions via anisotropic strain engineering. Combining spectroscopic ellipsometry, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we revealed the strong anisotropic transient optoelectronic response of strain-engineered RuO2/TiO2 (110) heterostructures along both in-plane [001] and [1-10] crystallographic directions. Theoretical analysis identifies strain-induced modifications in band nesting as the underlying mechanism for enhanced anisotropic carrier relaxation. These findings establish epitaxial strain engineering as a powerful tool for tuning anisotropic optoelectronic responses in metallic systems, paving the way for next-generation polarization-sensitive ultrafast optoelectronic devices.

Title: Metal-to-superconductor Transition Induced by Lithium Adsorption on Monolayer 1$T$-Nb$_2$C
Authors: Lingxiao Xiong, Yuhui Yan, Feipeng Zheng
Abstract: Recently, two-dimensional Nb$_2$C has garnered increasing attention due to its functional-group-dependent superconductivity, both experimentally and theoretically. In contrast to the halogen and chalcogen additives that have been the main focus of previous studies, we study the effect of lithium adsorption, which can also be incorporated during the synthesis of Nb$_2$C. Our computational analysis reveals a metal-to-superconductor transition in monolayer Nb$_2$C with a critical temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) of 22.1 K and a strong anisotropic superconducting gap distribution following the adsorption of lithium atoms. This emergent superconductivity is attributed to the increased electronic states at the Fermi energy, resulting from the contribution of Nb-$d$ orbitals and electron gas states induced by the low electronegativity of lithium. Furthermore, the application of tensile strain raises the $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ to 24 K, which is higher than that of most functional-group-modified Nb$_2$C systems. Our work deepens the understanding of electron-phonon coupling in layered Nb$_2$C, and provides new insights into achieving high critical temperature superconductivity with a strong anisotropic superconducting gap distribution in this system.

Title: Apparent nonreciprocal transport in FeSe bulk crystals
Authors: Taichi Terashima, Shinya Uji, Yuji Matsuda, Takasada Shibauchi, Shigeru Kasahara
Abstract: We performed low-frequency ac first- and second-harmonic resistance measurements and dc $I-V$ measurements on bulk FeSe crystals in a temperature range between 1.8 and 150 K and in magnetic field up to 14 T. We observed considerable second-harmonic resistance, indicative of nonreciprocal charge transport, in some samples. By examining correlation between contact resistances and second-harmonic signals, we concluded that the second-harmonic resistance was not due to the genuine nonreciprocal transport effect but was caused by joule heating at a current contact through the thermoelectric effect. Our conclusion is consistent with a recent preprint (Nagata \textit{et al.}, arXiv:2409.01715), in which the authors reported a zero-field superconducting diode effect in devices fabricated with FeSe flakes and attributed it to the thermoelectric effect.

Title: Velocity correlations of vortices and rarefaction pulses in compressible planar quantum fluids
Authors: Ashton S. Bradley, Nils A. Krause
Abstract: We develop a quantitive analytical treatment of two-point velocity correlations for two important classes of superfluid excitation in compressible quantum fluids: vortices, and rarefaction pulses. We achieve this using two approaches. First, we introduce a new ansatz for describing vortex cores in planar quantum fluids with improved analytic integrability that provides analytic results for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions, in good agreement with numerical results using the exact vortex shape. The results show signatures of short and long range correlations associated with vortex dipoles and vortex pairs respectively. Second, for the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton the asymptotic high velocity wavefunction provides analytical results for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the main length scale of the soliton. We compare our analytical treatment of the homogeneous system with numerical results for a trapped system, finding good quantitative agreement. Our results are relevant to experimental work to characterize quantum vortices and solitons in quantum fluids of atoms and light, and for studies of quantum turbulence.

Title: Band-edge superfluid of Bose-Einstein condensates in the spin-orbit-coupled Zeeman lattice
Authors: Huaxin He, Fengtao Pang, Hao Lyu, Yongping Zhang
Abstract: Since the first experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensates in a spin-orbit-coupled Zeeman lattice, a wide range of applications have been found in these systems. Here, we systematically study the ground-state phase diagram of the systems. We address that the band-edge phase in the ground-state phase diagram is exotic and exists in a very broad parameter regime. The superfluidity of the band-edge states is identified by elementary excitations and superfluid fraction.

Title: Chiral symmetry breaking and nonreciprocal spin wave in breathing-kagome antiferromagnets at zero field
Authors: Kazushi Aoyama, Hikaru Kawamura
Abstract: It has been known that the spin-wave dispersion, which is usually symmetric in the momentum space with respect to ${\bf q}=0$, can be asymmetric in the presence of the Dzaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and an applied magnetic field. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that in $J_3$-dominant classical Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the breathing kagome lattice, the asymmetric spin-wave dispersion appears in a chiral phase due to non-uniform geometric phases acquired in the spin-wave propagation processes. This points to the emergence of a nonreciprocal spin wave in the absence of both the DM interaction and the magnetic field. Reflecting the asymmetry, positive-spin-chirality and negative-spin-chirality states, either one of which is selected in the low-temperature phase by the symmetry breaking, show different spin-wave dispersions, suggesting that the two energetically-degenerate chiral states can be distinguished by the spin-wave propagation.

Title: The effect of duty cycle on electron transmission through a graphene electrostatic barrier
Authors: R. Biswas, S. Mukhopadhyay, C. Sinha
Abstract: We investigated theoretically the transmission properties of Dirac Fermions tunneling through a periodically (sinusoidal and rectangular) driven electrostatic barrier in Monolayer graphene. For the time harmonic potential with moderate to high alpha (=amplitude/frequency) the central Floquet band is found to be almost cloaked for the Klein transmitted electron in contrast to electron at higher grazing incidences. As a time periodic drive, we mainly focused on the use of rectangular wave electric signal to modulate the transparency of the barrier. It is noted that the asymmetric Fano resonance, a characteristic feature of photon assisted tunneling, is more likely to occur for rectangular drive in contrast to the harmonic one. The height of the modulating potential is particularly responsible for the dressing effect of the barrier. The position and nature of the FR can be tailored by changing the height and frequency of the rectangular drive. Moreover, the duty cycle of the driving potential turns out to be an important controlling parameter for the transmission process. Thus, the rectangular modulation plays an important role for the occurrence and detection of the Fano resonances which is vital for the use of graphene nanostructure in the field of detectors, sensors, modulators etc. The present findings attempt for the first time, to realize the effect of duty cycle on the quantum interference in semiconductor nanostructures.

Title: Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model Induced by On-Site or Long-Range Two-Body Losses
Authors: Julien Despres, Leonardo Mazza, Marco Schirò
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the dissipative dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model induced by on-site or long-range two-body losses. We first consider the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice, and study the dynamics induced by the sudden switch-on of two-body losses on a weakly-interacting superfluid state. The time-dependent density is obtained in the spirit of the Bogolyubov approach by calculating theoretically the equations of motion associated to the relevant quadratic bosonic correlators. In the one-dimensional case, our results compare very well with quasi-exact numerical calculations based on the quantum jump method implemented using tensor networks. We find that the intermediate-time dynamics of the density displays an algebraic decay characterized by an interaction-dependent power-law exponent. The latter property still holds for long-range two-body loss processes but it is absent in the two-dimensional square lattice with on-site losses. We finally investigate the dissipative quench dynamics starting from a strongly-correlated superfluid state or from a Mott-insulating state; for the Bose-Hubbard chain initially confined in the superfluid-correlated regime, an unexpected strong decay of the density appearing at short times is revealed.

Title: Recent Progress in Studies of Cobalt-based Quasi-1-dimensional Quantum Magnets
Authors: Lun Jin, Robert J. Cava
Abstract: The interplay of crystal electric field, temperature, and spin-orbit coupling can yield a Kramers ion and thus an effective S = 1/2 ground state for Co2+ ions (3d7), which is often the case for low dimensional materials. This is because a highly anisotropic structural motif can force the spins to point either up or down, hence becoming a system where spins communicate via Ising interactions. Cobalt-based quasi-1-dimensional materials have been studied in this context since the latter half of the 20th century, but due to the development of modern characterization techniques and advances in sample preparation, the exotic physical phenomena that have generated the most interest have only emerged in the most recent three to four decades. This topical review mainly summarizes progress in cobalt-based quasi-1-dimensional quantum magnets, and comments on a few research directions of potential future interest.

Title: Exploration of Zeolites as High-Performance Electrode Protective Layers for Alkali-Metal Batteries
Authors: Lina Wang, Guangfu Luo
Abstract: The electrode-electrolyte interfaces play pivotal roles in alkali-metal batteries, necessitating superior electrochemical stability, excellent electrical insulation, and high ionic conductivity. This study proposes using zeolites as interfacial protective layers owing to their inherently high stability with both alkali metals and high-voltage cathodes, as well as exceptionally wide bandgaps that minimize electron transport. To further pinpoint zeolites with rapid ionic diffusivity among their versatile structures, we devise a universal approach to explore diffusion dynamics in arbitrary structures. Through first-principles calculations, we identify the diffusion networks of Li+, Na+, and K+ in twenty-two, seventeen, and four zeolites, respectively. Eventually, we predict five, seven, and three zeolites as suitable interfacial protective layer for lithium-, sodium-, and potassium-metal batteries, respectively, each characterized by a diffusion barrier below 0.3 eV. This research automates the exploration of diffusion dynamics in complex materials and underscores the significant potential of zeolites as interfacial protective layers in alkali-metal batteries.

Title: Soliton resuscitations: asymmetric revivals of the breathing mode of an atomic bright soliton in a harmonic trap
Authors: Waranon Sroyngoen, James R. Anglin
Abstract: We study the collective modes of an atomic bright soliton realised in a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, using Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory. In particular we focus on the breathing mode of the soliton, which is not a single linearized normal mode but a common component of many modes, and therefore decays within a $t^{-1/2}$ envelope due to dispersion. If the soliton is held in the center of a harmonic trap, we show that the breathing amplitude revives periodically, as atoms shed from the vibrating soliton oscillate in the trap, and return. After each revival the breathing amplitude again decays, and this cycle repeats every trap half-period. The amplitude envelope of these breathing revivals shows a curious asymmetry, however, with a gradual increase in breathing followed by sudden drop in breathing amplitude that becomes more and more pronounced in later revivals. We explain this asymmetrical revival pattern by deriving a close analytical approximation to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes frequency spectrum, and offer this coherent Bogoliubov-de Gennes phenomenon as a background against which to compare possible quantum many-body effects, including decoherence over trap-period time scales.

Title: Eliminating nanometer-scale asperities on metallic thin films through plasma modification processes studied by molecular dynamics and AFM
Authors: Tomoyuki Tsuyama, Tatsuki Oyama, Yu Azuma, Haruhisa Ohashi, Masahiro Irie, Ayumi Yamakawa, Shoko Uetake, Takayuki Konno, Takahiro Ukai, Kohei Ochiai, Nobuyuki Iwaoka, Atsushi Hashimoto, Yoshishige Okuno
Abstract: We report the effects of reducing surface asperity size at the nanometer scale on metallic surfaces by plasma-assisted surface modification processes using simulations and experiments. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted by irradiating various inert gas ions (Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) onto a cobalt slab with nanoscale asperities on the surface. The MD simulations showed that as the atomic number of the inert gas increased the surface asperity size was reduced more efficiently, while the etching rate decreased. The dependencies of the scattering behaviors on the inert gas ions originated from the mass exchange between the working gas ions and the slab atoms. Atomic force microscopy and x-ray fluorescence measurements were performed on hard disk media subjected to the surface modification processes. These measurements experimentally demonstrated that the density of nanoscale asperities was reduced with a lower etching rate as the atomic number of the inert gas increased, consistent with the simulation results. Through this study, we clarified that heavier working gases were more effective in reducing surface asperity size without significantly reducing the thickness of the material, which can contribute to better control of surface morphologies at the nanometer scale.

Title: Quantify the stability of Majorana qubits through Rabi beat
Authors: Yu Zhang, Jiayi Chen, Jie Liu, X.C. Xie
Abstract: Evaluating the stability of Majorana qubits (MQ) is crucial for the advancement of topological quantum computation. In this work, we propose a method to quantify the stability of MQs through their Rabi this http URL approach involves coupling a fermionic state to the MQ and measuring the resulting Rabi oscillations induced by this coupling. This setup is feasible across a range of experimental this http URL show that Rabi beats emerge when considering finite-size effects and inhomogeneous potentials. The beating frequency is directly related to the deviations caused by these factors, providing a quantitative method to assess the stability of Majorana this http URL, we investigate the impact of dissipation on MQ stability. We find that the beating patterns are unaffected by weak dissipation. More intriguingly, dissipation would weaken in an ideal MQ. This suggests that non-local qubits can effectively avoid certain types of decoherence.

Title: Critical Motility-Induced Phase Separation in Three Dimensions is Consistent with Ising Universality
Authors: Jiechao Feng, Ahmad K. Omar
Abstract: Numerical investigations aiming to determine the universality class of critical motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in two dimensions (2D) have resulted in inconclusive findings. Here, using finite-size scaling results obtained from large-scale computer simulations, we find that the static and dynamic critical exponents associated with 3D MIPS all closely match those of the 3D Ising universality class with a conserved scalar order parameter. This finding is corroborated by fluctuating hydrodynamic description of the critical dynamics of the order parameter field which precisely matching model B in three dimensions. Our work suggests that 3D MIPS and indeed the entire phase diagram of active Brownian spheres is remarkably similar to that of molecular passive fluids despite the absence of Boltzmann statistics.

Title: Basic mechanisms for understanding container-content interactions: a fundamental perspective and application to polymer materials
Authors: Emmanuelle Feschet-Chassot, Philip Chennell
Abstract: This article provides a comprehensive understanding of the interactions that can occur at the interface between liquids and materials. It describes the phenomena of sorption (adsorption and absorption), permeation and leaching from a physicochemical perspective. In addition to examining these interactions, the historical context, detailing how these phenomena have been studied and demonstrated over time, it provides an understanding of the evolution of research in this field and the methodologies used to study these interactions, with a specific focus on polymer materials. The mechanisms underlying these interactions are presented as well as the equations that describe the processes involved, thus providing a scientific basis for understanding the complexities of container-content interactions.

Title: Interfacial Polarization Switching in Al0.92Sc0.08N/GaN Heterostructures Grown by Sputter Epitaxy
Authors: Niklas Wolff, Georg Schönweger, Redwanul Md. Islam, Ziming Ding, Christian Kübel, Simon Fichtner, Lorenz Kienle
Abstract: The integration of ferroelectric nitride thin films such as Al1-xScxN onto GaN templates could enable enhanced functionality in novel high-power transistors and memory devices. This requires a detailed understanding of the ferroelectric domain structures and their impact on the electric properties. In this contribution, the sputter epitaxy of highly coherent Al0.92Sc0.08N thin films grown on GaN approaching lattice-matching conditions is demonstrated. Scanning transmission electron microscopy investigations reveal the formation of polar domains and the mechanism of domain propagation upon ferroelectric switching. Atomic resolution imaging suggests that polarization inversion is initiated by an interfacial switching process in which already the first atomic layer of Al1-xScxN changes its polarization from the as-grown M- to N-polarity. An atomically sharp planar polarization discontinuity is identified at the Al0.92Sc0.08N/GaN interface and described by atomic modeling and chemical structure analysis using electron energy loss spectroscopy, considering local lattice spacings. Moreover, residual domains with M-polarity are identified at the top Pt electrode interface. These insights on the location and the atomic structure of ferroelectric inversion domains in sputter deposited Al1-xScxN/GaN heterostructures will support the development of future non-volatile memory devices and novel HEMT structures based on ferroelectric nitride thin films via interface engineering.

Title: Universal criterion for selective outcomes under stochastic resetting
Authors: Suvam Pal, Leonardo Dagdug, Dibakar Ghosh, Denis Boyer, Arnab Pal
Abstract: Resetting plays a pivotal role in optimizing the completion time of complex first passage processes with single or multiple outcomes/exit possibilities. While it is well established that the coefficient of variation -- a statistical dispersion defined as a ratio of the fluctuations over the mean of the first passage time -- must be larger than unity for resetting to be beneficial for any outcome averaged over all the possibilities, the same can not be said while conditioned on a particular outcome. The purpose of this letter is to derive a universal condition which reveals that two statistical metric -- the mean and coefficient of variation of the conditional times -- come together to determine when resetting can expedite the completion of a selective outcome, and furthermore can govern the biasing between preferential and non-preferential outcomes. The universality of this result is demonstrated for a one dimensional diffusion process subjected to resetting with two absorbing boundaries.

Title: Quantum geometry and the electric magnetochiral anisotropy in noncentrosymmetric polar media
Authors: Pierpaolo Fontana, Victor Velasco, Chang Niu, Peide D. Ye, Pedro V. Lopes, Kaio E. M. de Souza, Marcus V. O. Moutinho, Caio Lewenkopf, Marcello B. Silva Neto
Abstract: The electric magnetochiral anisotropy is a nonreciprocal phenomenon accessible via second harmonic transport in noncentrosymmetric, time-reversal invariant materials, in which the rectification of current, ${\bf I}$, can be controlled by an external magnetic field, ${\bf B}$. Quantum geometry, which characterizes the topology of Bloch electrons in a Hilbert space, provides a powerful description of the nonlinear dynamics in topological materials. Here, we demonstrate that the electric magnetochiral anisotropy in noncentrosymmetric polar media owes its existence to the quantum metric, arising from the spin-orbit coupling, and to large Born effective charges. In this context, the reciprocal magnetoresistance $\beta{\bf B}^2$ is modified to $R( I,P,B)=R_0[1+\beta B^2 + \gamma^{\pm}{\bf I}\cdot({\bf P}\times{\bf B})]$, where the chirality dependent $\gamma^{\pm}$ is determined by the quantum metric dipole and the polarization ${\bf P}$. We predict a universal scaling $\gamma^{\pm}(V)\sim V^{-5/2}$ which we verified by phase sensitive, second harmonic transport measurements on hydrothermally grown 2D tellurium films under applied gate voltage, $V$. The control of rectification by varying ${\bf I}$, ${\bf P}$, ${\bf B}$, and $V$, demonstrated in this work, opens up new avenues for the building of ultra-scaled CMOS circuits.

Title: Sliding dynamics of a particle in a soap film
Authors: Youna Louyer, Benjamin Dollet, Isabelle Cantat, Anaïs Gauthier
Abstract: We investigate the sliding dynamics of a millimeter-sized particle trapped in a horizontal soap film. Once released, the particle moves toward the center of the film in damped oscillations. We study experimentally and model the forces acting on the particle, and evidence the key role of the mass of the film on its shape and particle dynamics. Not only is the gravitational distortion of the film measurable, it completely determines the force responsible for the motion of the particle - the catenoid-like deformation induced by the particle has negligible effect on the dynamics. Surprisingly, this is expected for all film sizes as long as the particle radius remains much smaller than the film width. We also measure the friction force, and show that ambient air and the film contribute almost equally to the friction. The theoretical model that we propose predicts exactly the friction coefficient as long as inertial effects can be neglected in air (for the smallest and slowest particles). The fit between theory and experiments sets an upper boundary of 0.01 {\mu}Pa s m for the surface viscosity, in excellent agreement with recent interfacial microrheology measurements.

Title: Fundamental Theory of Current-Induced Motion of Magnetic Skyrmions
Authors: Yuto Ohki, Masahito Mochizuki
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin textures that appear in magnets with broken spatial inversion symmetry via competition between the (anti)ferromagnetic exchange interactions and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a magnetic field. Their current-driven dynamics have been extensively studied aiming at spintronic applications. However, current-induced skyrmion motion exhibits diverse behaviors depending on various factors and conditions such as the type of skyrmion, driving mechanism, system geometry, direction of applied current, and type of the magnet. While this variety attracts enormous research interest of fundamental science and enriches their possibilities of technical applications, it is, at the same time, a source of difficulty and complexity that hinders their comprehensive understandings. In this article, we discuss fundamental and systematic theoretical descriptions of current-induced motion of skyrmions driven by the spin-transfer torque and the spin-orbit torque. Specifically, we theoretically describe the behaviors of current-driven skyrmions depending on the factors and conditions mentioned above by means of analyses using the Thiele equation. Furthermore, the results of the analytical theory are visually demonstrated and quantitatively confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. In particular, we discuss dependence of the direction and velocity of motion on the type of skyrmion (Bloch type and Neel type) and its helicity, the system geometry (thin plate and nanotrack), the direction of applied current (length and width direction of the nanotrack) and its spin-polarization orientation, and the type of magnet (ferromagnet and antiferromagnet). The comprehensive theory provided by this article is expected to contribute significantly to research on the manipulation and control of magnetic skyrmions by electric currents for future spintronics applications.

Title: Orbital-selective correlation effects and superconducting pairing symmetry in a multiorbital $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelates
Authors: Guijing Duan, Zhiguang Liao, Lei Chen, Yiming Wang, Rong Yu, Qimiao Si
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ raises key questions about its mechanism and the nature of pairing symmetry. This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.

Title: Water-in-water PEG/DEX/protein microgel emulsions: effect of microgel particle size on the rate of emulsion phase separation
Authors: Andrzej Balis, Georgi Gochev, Domenico Truzzolillo, Dawid Lupa, Liliana Szyk-Warszynska, Jan Zawala
Abstract: Protein nanoparticles have been proven to be highly effective stabilizers of water-in-water emulsions obtained from a number of different types of aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS). The stabilizing efficiency of such particles is attributed to their affinity to the water/water interface of relevant ATPS, and emulsion formulations with long-term stability were reported in the recent years. In this study we investigated the macroscopic dynamics of the early-stage time evolution of dextran-in-polyethylene glycol emulsions obtained from a single ATPS and containing beta-lactoglobulin microgel particles of various diameters (ca. 40-190 nm). The results revealed the existence of a threshold in microgel size above which the water-in-water emulsion is stabilized, and that the process of segregative phase separation is determined by the interplay of droplets coalescence and sedimentation. Efficient droplet coalescence inhibition was found for microgel particles larger than 60 nm. Based on previous literature results, we discuss our coalescence-driven phase separation data in the context of the formation of durable particle layers on the emulsion droplets and the resulting droplet-droplet interactions.

Title: Modeling and Physics of Multiferroic Perovskite Manganites
Authors: Masahito Mochizuki
Abstract: A new type of multiferroicity was experimentally discovered in 2003 in a perovskite manganite TbMnO$_3$ where its ferroelectricity is induced by cycloidally ordered Mn spins. Susequently, such spin-cycloid multiferroic phase was also discovered in $R$MnO$_3$ with other rare-earth ions $R$=Dy, Eu$_{1-x}$Y$_x$, Tb$_{1-x}$Gd$_x$, etc. In this class of materials, the magnetism and ferroelectricity are inseparably coupled, and resulting strong magnetoelectric coupling enables us to control/manipulate the electricity (magnetism) by magnetic (electric) fields. Moreover, many interesting magnetoelectric phenomena due to their cross correlation have been discovered. In this article, we discuss a microscopic theoretical model for $R$MnO$_3$ constructed by taking into account their precise electronic and lattice structures and overview the theoretical works based on this model which elucidated rich magnetoelectric phenomena of $R$MnO$_3$. The perovskite manganites are not only the first-discovered spin-spiral multiferroic materials but also a typical class of materials that exhibits most of the magnetoelectric phenomena manifested in many other multiferroics. Therefore, the comprehensive understanding of $R$MnO$_3$ directly leads to the clarification of universal physics of magnetoelectric phenomena in multiferroic materials.

Title: Machine-Learning Detection of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transitions
Authors: Masahito Mochizuki, Yusuke Miyajima
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is a typical topological phase transition defined between binding and unbinding states of vortices and antivortices, which is not accompanied by spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is known that the BKT transition is difficult to detect from thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat and magnetic susceptibility because of the absence of anomaly in free energy and significant finite-size effects. Therefore, methods based on statistical mechanics which are commonly used to discuss phase transitions cannot be easily applied to the BKT transition. In recent years, several attempts to detect the BKT transition using machine-learning methods based on image recognition techniques have been reported. However, it has turned out that the detection is difficult even for machine learning methods because of the absence of trivial order parameters and symmetry breaking. Most of the methods proposed so far require prior knowledge about the models and/or preprocessing of input data for feature engineering, which is problematic in terms of the general applicability. In this article, we introduce recent development of the machine-learning methods to detect the BKT transitions in several spin models. Specifically, we demonstrate the success of two new methods named temperature-identification method and phase-classification method for detecting the BKT transitions in the q-state clock model and the XXZ model. This progress is expected to sublimate the machine-learning-based study of spin models for exploring new physics beyond simple benchmark test.

Title: Modelling spin-orbitronics effects at interfaces and chiral molecules
Authors: Poonam Kumari, Cyrille Barreteau, Alexander Smogunov
Abstract: Using orbital angular momentum (OAM) currents in nanoelectronics, for example, for magnetization manipulation via spin-orbit torque (SOT), represents a growing field known as "spin-orbitronics". Here, using the density functional theory (DFT) and the real-time dynamics of electronic wave packets, we explore a possibility of generation and propagation of orbital currents in two representative systems: an oxidized Cu surface (where large OAMs are known to form at the Cu/O interface) and a model molecular junction made of two carbon chains connected by a chiral molecule. In the Cu/O system, the orbital polarization of an incident wave packet from the Cu lead is strongly enhanced at the Cu/O interface but then rapidly decays in the bulk Cu due to orbital quenching of asymptotic bulk states. Interestingly, if a finite transmission across the oxygen layer is allowed (in a tunnel junction geometry, for example), a significant spin-polarization of transmitted (or reflected) currents is instead predicted which persists at a much longer distance and can be further tuned by an applied in-plane voltage. For the molecular junction, the mixing of the carbon $p_x$ and $p_y$ (degenerate) channels by the chiral molecular orbital gives rise not only to an efficient generation of orbital current but also to its long-range propagation along the carbon chain.

Title: Approaching the ultrastrong coupling regime between an Andreev level and a microwave resonator
Authors: O.O. Shvetsov, A. Khola, V. Buccheri, I.P.C. Cools, N. Trnjanin, T. Kanne, J. Nygård, A. Geresdi
Abstract: Josephson junctions formed in semiconductor nanowires host Andreev bound states and serve as a physical platform to realize Andreev qubits tuned by electrostatic gating. With the Andreev bound state being confined to the nanoscale weak link, it couples to a circuit-QED architecture via the state-dependent supercurrent flowing through the weak link. Thus, increasing this coupling strength is a crucial challenge for this architecture. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication and microwave characterization of an InAs nanowire weak link embedded in a superconducting loop with a lumped-element resonator patterned from a thin NbTiN film with high kinetic inductance. We investigated several devices with various weak link lengths and performed spectroscopy of spin-degenerate and spin-orbit split Andreev bound states for the shorter and longer weak links, respectively. Our approach offers a compact geometry and a large resonator impedance above 12 k$\Omega$ at a resonator frequency of 8 GHz, which results in a measured coupling strength reaching 1.95 GHz to the Andreev level and 77 MHz to the Andreev spin. Our spectroscopic data are in good agreement with existing theoretical models and demonstrate ultrastrong coupling to the Andreev pair qubit with the coupling strength approaching the bare resonator and qubit frequencies.

Title: The quest for new materials: the network theory and machine learning perspectives
Authors: Jacopo Moi, Davide Spallarossa, Stefano Bonetti, Raffaella Burioni, Guido Caldarelli
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the emergence of novel materials is a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, materials science and technology. With the rapid growth of materials databases in both size and reliability, the challenge shifts from data collection to efficient exploration of this vast and complex space. A key strategy lies in a smart use of descriptors at multiple scales, ranging from atomic arrangements to macroscopic properties, to represent materials in high-dimensional abstract spaces. Network theory provides a powerful framework to structure and analyze these relationships, capturing hidden patterns and guiding discovery. Machine Learning complements this approach by enabling predictive modeling, dimensionality reduction, and the identification of promising material candidates. By integrating network-based methods with Machine Learning techniques, researchers can construct, analyze, and efficiently navigate the material space, uncovering novel materials with tailored properties. This review explores the synergy between network theory and ML, highlighting their role in accelerating materials discovery through a systematic and interpretable approach.

Title: Collective magnetism of atomic momentum states
Authors: Garrett R. Williams, Rishi P. Lohar, Tao Chen, Brian L. DeMarco, Bryce Gadway
Abstract: Organization and ordering from interactions in many-body systems underlies our understanding of phases of classical and quantum matter. Magnetism has played a particularly foundational role in the study of many-body phases. Here, we explore the collective magnetism that emerges from two laser-coupled momentum modes of a scalar bosonic quantum gas. We employ adiabatic state preparation and explore the collective magnetization response to an applied bias potential, finding that the relative increase of interactions leads to an enhanced and muted response for the ground state and excited state, respectively. We further find evidence for significant $Z_2$ symmetry breaking of the sample magnetization for the ground state, consistent with the expected beyond-mean-field behavior. These results suggest that the nonlinear interactions of scalar Bose condensates could provide a simple, direct path towards the squeezing of momentum states for quantum sensing.

Title: Chirality-induced Spin-Orbit Coupling and Spin Selectivity
Authors: Massimiliano Di Ventra, Rafael Gutierrez, Gianaurelio Cuniberti
Abstract: We show that a spinor traveling along a helical path develops a spin-orbit coupling due to the cur- vature of the path. We then estimate the magnitude of this eff ective geometric spin-orbit interaction for structures that showcase chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We fi nd that this chiral-induced spin-orbit coupling (\chi-SOC), coupled to broken time-reversal symmetry, may provide a simple, yet rigorous way to describe the CISS phenomenon.

Title: Phase space contraction rate for classical mixed states
Authors: Mohamed Sahbani, Swetamber Das, Jason R. Green
Abstract: Physical systems with non-reciprocal or dissipative forces evolve according to a generalization of Liouville's equation that accounts for the expansion and contraction of phase space volume. Here, we connect geometric descriptions of these non-Hamiltonian dynamics to a recently established classical density matrix theory. In this theory, the evolution of a "maximally mixed" classical density matrix is related to the well-known phase space contraction rate that, when ensemble averaged, is the rate of entropy exchange with the surroundings. Here, we extend the definition of mixed states to include statistical and mechanical components, describing both the deformations of local phase space regions and the evolution of ensembles within them. As a result, the equation of motion for this mixed state represents the rate of contraction for an ensemble of dissipative trajectories. Recognizing this density matrix as a covariance matrix, its contraction rate is another measure of entropy flow characterizing nonequilibrium steady states.

Title: Evidence of the matrix effect on a compositionally graded oxide thin film
Authors: J. Scola, F. Jomard, E. Loire, J. Wolfman, B. Negulescu, G. Z. Liu, M.-A. Pinault-Thaury
Abstract: A heterostructure of Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$TiO$_3$/La$_{1.1}$Sr$_{0.9}$NiO$_3$ /SrTiO$_3$ has been analysed by magnetic sector secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The stoichiometry parameter $x$ of the top layer was made varying continuously from 0 to 1 along the width of the sample by combinatorial pulsed laser deposition. Prior to SIMS analysis, the composition gradient of Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$TiO$_3$ was quantitatively characterized by chemical characterizations including wavelength and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopies. Even if the Ti content is constant into Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$TiO$_3${}, its ionic yield exhibits an increasing trend as Ba is substituted by Sr. Such a phenomenon can be explained by the variation of the neighbouring atoms chemistry which affects the ionization probability of titanium during the sputtering process. In addition to the continuously varying composition, the oxide multilayer sample features sharp interfaces hence the in-depth resolution under our analysing conditions has been investigated too. The modelling of the interface crossing profiles reveals that the instrumental contribution to the profile broadening is as low as 5 nm.

Title: Controlling Symmetries and Quantum Criticality in the Anisotropic Coupled-Top Model
Authors: Wen-Jian Mao, Tian Ye, Liwei Duan, Yan-Zhi Wang
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic coupled-top model, which describes the interactions between two large spins along both $x-$ and $y-$directions. By tuning anisotropic coupling strengths along distinct directions, we can manipulate the system's symmetry, inducing either discrete $Z_2$ or continuous U(1) symmetry. In the thermodynamic limit, the mean-field phase diagram is divided into five phases: the disordered paramagnetic phase, the ordered ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic phases with symmetry breaking along either $x-$ or $y-$direction. This results in a double degeneracy of the spin projections along the principal direction for $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. When U(1) symmetry is broken, infinite degeneracy associated with the Goldstone mode emerges. Beyond the mean-field ansatz, at the critical points, the energy gap closes, and both quantum fluctuations and entanglement entropy diverge, signaling the onset of second-order quantum phase transitions. These critical behaviors consistently support the universality class of $Z_2$ symmetry. Contrarily, when U(1) symmetry is broken, the energy gap vanishes beyond the critical points, yielding a novel exponent of 1, rather than 1/2 for $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. The framework provides an ideal platform for experimentally controlling symmetries and investigating associated physical phenomena.

Title: Angle-dependent dissipation effects in topological insulator-based Josephson junctions
Authors: Ardamon Sten, Paramita Dutta, Sudeep Kumar Ghosh
Abstract: Dissipation fundamentally alters quantum transport in Josephson junctions. Here, we demonstrate unique transport signatures in dissipative topological insulator-based Josephson junctions, which provide a powerful platform for exploring the competition between dissipation and topological protection. We incorporate dissipation effects by coupling a `lossy' metallic lead at the junction to an electron reservoir, and describe its effects using an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian within the Lindblad formalism. Non-Hermiticity introduces finite lifetimes to the helical Andreev bound states in the junction, with imaginary energy components that depend on the quasiparticle incidence angle, while Klein tunneling remains robust for normal incidence. Unlike `ordinary' non-Hermitian Josephson junctions, this system exhibits no Josephson gaps or forbidden regions, preserving topological protection. In the fully non-Hermitian regime, a tunable line of zero-energy states emerges, bounded by exceptional-like points with divergent supercurrents. Our results reveal how dissipation reshapes superconducting transport in topological insulator-based Josephson junctions, opening new directions for dissipation-engineered hybrid quantum devices.

Title: Dialectics of antimicrobial peptides I: common mechanisms of offensive and protecting roles of the peptides
Authors: Marta V. Volovik, Zaret G. Denieva, Oleg V. Kondrashov, Sergey A. Akimov, Oleg V. Batishchev
Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have intrigued researchers for decades due to the contradiction between their high potential against resistant bacteria and the inability to find a structure-function relationship for the development of an effective and non-toxic agent. In the present study and the companion paper [Phys. Rev. E (2024)], we performed a comprehensive experimental and theoretical analysis of various aspects of AMP-membrane interactions and AMP-induced pore formation. Using the well-known melittin and magainin as examples, we showed, using patch-clamp and fluorescence measurements, that these peptides, even at nanomolar concentrations, modify the membrane by making it permeable to protons (and, possibly, water), but not to ions, and protect the membrane from large pore formation after subsequent addition of 20-fold higher concentrations of AMPs. This protective effect is independent of the membrane side (or both sides) of the peptide addition and is determined by the peptide-induced deformations of the membrane. Peptides create small, H+-permeable pores that incessantly connect the opposing membrane leaflets, allowing translocation of peptides and lipids and thus preventing further generation of large lateral pressure/tension imbalance. At the same time, such an imbalance is a key to the formation of peptide-induced pores at high AMP concentrations, with the main contribution coming from single ion-conducting events rather than stable channel-like structures. Therefore, our results suggest that lowering the AMP concentration, which is a common principle to reduce toxicity, may actually make bacteria resistant to AMP. However, a protective pre-treatment with nanomolar concentrations of peptides may be the key to protect eukaryotic cells from the high concentrations of AMPs.

Title: Superconducting diode efficiency from singlet-triplet mixing in disordered systems
Authors: Jaglul Hasan, Daniel Shaffer, Maxim Khodas, Alex Levchenko
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) -- the nonreciprocity of the critical current in a bulk superconductor -- has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in superconducting electronics. However, the role of disorder scattering in SDE has rarely been considered, despite its potential qualitative impact, as we demonstrate in this work. We investigate SDE in a disordered Rashba superconductor under an in-plane magnetic field, employing a self-consistent Born approximation to derive the corresponding Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our analysis reveals two surprising effects. First, in the weak Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) regime, disorder can reverse the direction of the diode effect, indicated by a sign change in the superconducting diode efficiency coefficient. Second, in the strong Rashba SOC regime, disorder becomes the driving mechanism of SDE, which vanishes in its absence. In this case, we show that disorder-induced mixing of singlet and triplet superconducting orders underlies the effect.

Title: Transformer-Enhanced Variational Autoencoder for Crystal Structure Prediction
Authors: Ziyi Chen, Yang Yuan, Siming Zheng, Jialong Guo, Sihan Liang, Yangang Wang, Zongguo Wang
Abstract: Crystal structure forms the foundation for understanding the physical and chemical properties of materials. Generative models have emerged as a new paradigm in crystal structure prediction(CSP), however, accurately capturing key characteristics of crystal structures, such as periodicity and symmetry, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-Enhanced Variational Autoencoder for Crystal Structure Prediction (TransVAE-CSP), who learns the characteristic distribution space of stable materials, enabling both the reconstruction and generation of crystal structures. TransVAE-CSP integrates adaptive distance expansion with irreducible representation to effectively capture the periodicity and symmetry of crystal structures, and the encoder is a transformer network based on an equivariant dot product attention mechanism. Experimental results on the carbon_24, perov_5, and mp_20 datasets demonstrate that TransVAE-CSP outperforms existing methods in structure reconstruction and generation tasks under various modeling metrics, offering a powerful tool for crystal structure design and optimization.

Authors: Oleg V. Kondrashov, Marta V. Volovik, Zaret G. Denieva, Polina K. Gifer, Timur R. Galimzyanov, Peter I. Kuzmin, Oleg V. Batishchev, Sergey A. Akimov
Abstract: Amphipathic peptides are considered promising antibiotics because of their ability to form pores in bacterial membranes. In two companion papers, we analyzed both experimentally and theoretically the mechanisms and consequences of the interaction of two types of amphipathic peptides (magainin and melittin) with lipid membranes. We studied this interaction for different peptide concentration: low, high, and low concentration followed by the addition of peptides in high concentration. Here we provide the theoretical description of the pore formation mechanisms. We predicted theoretically that two peptide molecules are enough to locally induce the formation of a small metastable pore that continuously connects two membrane leaflets and allows peptide and lipid translocation between the leaflets. This mechanism (referred to as local) is supposed to work at low peptide concentrations. When applied in high concentration, the one-sided adsorption of peptides onto a closed membrane generates lateral pressure in the contacting lipid monolayer and lateral tension in the opposing monolayer. Our calculations predicted such asymmetric pressure/tension to greatly facilitate the formation of large metastable pores at any point of the membrane, regardless of the distance to the nearest peptide molecule. We therefore refer to this mechanism of pore formation as non-local. When the application of peptides in low concentration is followed by high concentration addition, multiple small metastable pores are predicted to form in the membrane in accordance with the local mechanism. This prevents the generation of a large difference in lateral pressure/tension, thus protecting the membrane from the formation of large pores. The results of the theoretical analysis agree with the experimental data of the companion paper.

Title: Counterflow of lattice polarons in harmonically confined optical lattices
Authors: Felipe Isaule, Abel Rojo-Francàs, Luis Morales-Molina, Bruno Juliá-Díaz
Abstract: We study a mobile impurity in a one-dimensional harmonically confined optical lattice interacting repulsively with a bosonic bath. The behavior of the impurity across baths with superfluid and Mott-insulator domains is examined, including its full back-action effect on the bath. We characterize the bath-impurity phase diagram and reveal the appearance of a correlated counterflow phase, which we support with an analytical model for a mobile impurity-hole pair. This phase shows a combined insulator domain of unity filling but no independent domain of constant density. The transition to this phase features a sudden orthogonality catastrophe and the change of the shape of the impurity's profile to that of a free particle in an infinite square well. The findings of this work suggest the appearance of unconventional counterflow in trapped imbalanced atomic mixtures.

Title: Broadband photoresponse enhancement by band engineering in Sb-doped MnBi2Te4
Authors: Zixuan Xu, Haonan Chen, Jiayu Wang, Yicheng Mou, Yingchao Xia, Jiaming Gu, Yuxiang Wang, Qi Liu, Jiaqi Liu, Wenqing Song, Qing Lan, Tuoyu Zhao, Wu Shi, Cheng Zhang
Abstract: Topological materials have attracted considerable attention for their potential in broadband and fast photoresponse, particularly in the infrared regime. However, the high carrier concentration in these systems often leads to rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers, limiting the photoresponsivity. Here, we demonstrate that Sb doping in MnBi2Te4 effectively reduces carrier concentration and suppresses electron-hole recombination, thereby significantly improving the optoelectronic performance across the visible to mid-infrared spectra. The optimally doped Mn(Bi0.82Sb0.18)2Te4 photodetector achieves a responsivity of 3.02 mA W-1 with a response time of 18.5 {\mu}s at 1550 nm, and 0.795 mA W-1 with a response time of 9.0 {\mu}s at 4 {\mu}m. These values represent nearly two orders of magnitude improvement compared to undoped MnBi2Te4. Our results highlight band engineering as an effective strategy to enhance the infrared performance of topological material-based photodetectors, opening new avenues for high-sensitivity infrared detection.

Title: Unexpected large electrostatic gating by pyroelectric charge accumulation
Authors: Yicheng Mou, Qi Liu, Jiaqi Liu, Yingchao Xia, Zejing Guo, Wenqing Song, Jiaming Gu, Zixuan Xu, Wenbin Wang, Hangwen Guo, Wu Shi, Jian Shen, Cheng Zhang
Abstract: Pyroelectricity refers to the accumulation of charges due to changes in the spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric materials when subjected to temperature variations. Typically, these pyroelectric charges are considered unstable and dissipate quickly through interactions with the external environment. Consequently, the pyroelectric effect has been largely overlooked in ferroelectric field-effect transistors. In this work, we leverage the van der Waals interface of hBN to achieve a substantial and long-term electrostatic gating effect in graphene devices via the pyroelectric properties of a ferroelectric LiNbO3 substrate. Upon cooling, the polarization change in LiNbO3 induces high doping concentrations up to 1013 cm-2 in the adjacent graphene. Through a combination of transport measurements and non-contact techniques, we demonstrate that the pyroelectric charge accumulation, as well as its enhancement in electric fields, are responsible for this unexpectedly high doping level. Our findings introduce a novel mechanism for voltage-free electrostatic gating control with long retention.

Title: Coherent detection of the oscillating acoustoelectric effect in graphene
Authors: Yicheng Mou, Jiayu Wang, Haonan Chen, Yingchao Xia, Hailong Li, Qing Yan, Xue Jiang, Yijia Wu, Wu Shi, Hua Jiang, X. C. Xie, Cheng Zhang
Abstract: In recent years, surface acoustic waves (SAWs) have emerged as a novel technique for generating quasiparticle transport and band modulation in condensed matter systems. SAWs interact with adjacent materials through piezoelectric and strain fields, dragging carriers in the direction of wave propagation. Most studies on the acoustoelectric effect have focused on the collective directional motion of carriers, which generates a steady electric potential difference, while the oscillating component from dynamic spatial charge modulation has remained challenging to probe. In this work, we report the coherent detection of oscillating acoustoelectric effect in graphene. This is achieved through the coherent rectification of spatial-temporal charge oscillation with electromagnetic waves emitted by interdigital transducers. We systematically investigate the frequency and gate dependence of rectified signals and quantitatively probe the carrier redistribution dynamics driven by SAWs. The observation of oscillating acoustoelectric effect provides direct access to the dynamic spatial charge modulation induced by SAWs through transport experiments.

Title: Run-and-tumble particles with 1D Coulomb interaction: the active jellium model and the non-reciprocal self-gravitating gas
Authors: Léo Touzo, Pierre Le Doussal
Abstract: Recently we studied $N$ run-and-tumble particles in one dimension - which switch with rate $\gamma$ between driving velocities $\pm v_0$ - interacting via the long range 1D Coulomb potential (also called rank interaction), both in the attractive and in the repulsive case, with and without a confining potential. We extend this study in two directions. First we consider the same system, but inside a harmonic confining potential, which we call "active jellium". We obtain a parametric representation of the particle density in the stationary state at large $N$, which we analyze in detail. Contrary to the linear potential, there is always a steady-state where the density has a bounded support. However, we find that the model still exhibits transitions between phases with different behaviors of the density at the edges, ranging from a continuous decay to a jump, or even a shock (i.e. a cluster of particles, which manifests as a delta peak in the density). Notably, the interactions forbid a divergent density at the edges, which may occur in the non-interacting case. In the second part, we consider a non-reciprocal version of the rank interaction: the $+$ particles (of velocity $+v_0$) are attracted towards the $-$ particles (of velocity $-v_0$) with a constant force $b/N$, while the $-$ particles are repelled by the $+$ particles with a force of same amplitude. In order for a stationary state to exist we add a linear confining potential. We derive an explicit expression for the stationary density at large $N$, which exhibits an explicit breaking of the mirror symmetry with respect to $x=0$. This again shows the existence of several phases, which differ by the presence or absence of a shock at $x=0$, with one phase even exhibiting a vanishing density on the whole region $x>0$. Our analytical results are complemented by numerical simulations for finite $N$.

Title: Excess energy and countercurrents after a quantum kick
Authors: Nuria Santervás-Arranz, Massimiliano Stengel, Emilio Artacho
Abstract: A quantum system of interacting particles under the effect of a static external potential is hereby described as kicked when that potential suddenly starts moving with a constant velocity v. If initially in a stationary state, the excess energy at any time after the kick equals $v \langle P \rangle (t)$, with P being the total momentum of the system. If the system is finite and remains bound, the long time average of the excess energy tends to $Mv^2$, with M the system's total mass, or a related expression if there is particle emission. $Mv^2$ is twice what expected from an infinitely smooth onset of motion, and any monotonic onset is expected to increase the average energy to a value within both limits. In a macroscopic system, a particle flow emerges countering the potential's motion when electrons stay partially behind. For charged particles the described kinetic kick is equivalent to the kick given by the infinitely short electric-field pulse $E = \frac{m}{q} v \delta (t)$ to the system at rest, useful as a formal limit in ultrafast phenomena. A linear-response analysis of low-v countercurrents in kicked metals shows that the coefficient of the linear term in v is the Drude weight. Non-linear in v countercurrents are expected for insulators through the electron-hole excitations induced by the kick, going as $v^3$ at low v for centrosymmetric ones. First-principles calculations for simple solids are used to ratify those predictions, although the findings apply more generally to systems such as Mott insulators or cold lattices of bosons or fermions.

Title: Extinction and Metastability of Pheromone-Roads in Stochastic Models for Foraging Walks of Ants
Authors: Saori Morimoto, Makoto Katori, Hiraku Nishimori
Abstract: Macroscopic changes of group behavior of eusocial insects are studied from the viewpoint of non-equilibrium phase transitions. Recent combined study of experiments and mathematical modeling by the group led by the third author suggests that a species of garden ant switches the individual foraging walk from pheromone-mediated to visual-cues-mediated depending on situation. If an initial pheromone-road between the nest and food sources is a detour, ants using visual cues can pioneer shorter paths. These shorter paths are reinforced by pheromone secreted by following ants, and then the detour ceases to exist. Once the old pheromone-road extincts, there will be almost no chance to reconstruct it. Hence the extinction of pheromone-road is expected to be regarded as a phase transition to an absorbing state. We propose a discrete-time model on a square lattice consisting of switching random walks interacting though time-dependent pheromone field. The numerical study shows that the critical phenomena of the present extinction transitions of pheromone-roads do not seem to belong to the directed percolation universality class associated with the usual absorbing-state transition. The new aspects are cased by the coexistence and competition with newly creating pheromone-roads. In a regime in the extinction phase, the annihilating road shows metastability and takes long time-period to be replaced by a new road.

Title: DiffRenderGAN: Addressing Training Data Scarcity in Deep Segmentation Networks for Quantitative Nanomaterial Analysis through Differentiable Rendering and Generative Modelling
Authors: Dennis Possart, Leonid Mill, Florian Vollnhals, Tor Hildebrand, Peter Suter, Mathis Hoffmann, Jonas Utz, Daniel Augsburger, Mareike Thies, Mingxuan Wu, Fabian Wagner, George Sarau, Silke Christiansen, Katharina Breininger
Abstract: Nanomaterials exhibit distinctive properties governed by parameters such as size, shape, and surface characteristics, which critically influence their applications and interactions across technological, biological, and environmental contexts. Accurate quantification and understanding of these materials are essential for advancing research and innovation. In this regard, deep learning segmentation networks have emerged as powerful tools that enable automated insights and replace subjective methods with precise quantitative analysis. However, their efficacy depends on representative annotated datasets, which are challenging to obtain due to the costly imaging of nanoparticles and the labor-intensive nature of manual annotations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DiffRenderGAN, a novel generative model designed to produce annotated synthetic data. By integrating a differentiable renderer into a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, DiffRenderGAN optimizes textural rendering parameters to generate realistic, annotated nanoparticle images from non-annotated real microscopy images. This approach reduces the need for manual intervention and enhances segmentation performance compared to existing synthetic data methods by generating diverse and realistic data. Tested on multiple ion and electron microscopy cases, including titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$), silicon dioxide (SiO$_2$)), and silver nanowires (AgNW), DiffRenderGAN bridges the gap between synthetic and real data, advancing the quantification and understanding of complex nanomaterial systems.

Title: Journey from the Wilson exact RG towards the Wegner-Morris Fokker-Planck RG and the Carosso field-coarsening via Langevin stochastic processes
Authors: Cecile Monthus
Abstract: Within the Wilson RG of 'incomplete integration' as a function of the RG-time $t$, the non-linear differential RG flow for the energy $E_t[\phi(.)]$ translates for the probability distribution $P_t[\phi(.)] \sim e^{- E_t[\phi(.)]} $ into the linear Fokker-Planck RG flow associated to independent non-identical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes for the Fourier modes. The corresponding Langevin stochastic differential equation for the real-space field $\phi_t(\vec x)$ can be then interpreted within the Carosso perspective as genuine infinitesimal coarsening-transformations that are the analog of spin-blocking, and whose irreversible character is essential to overcome the paradox of the naive description of the Wegner-Morris RG flow as a mere infinitesimal change of variables in the partition function integral. This interpretation suggests to consider new RG-schemes, in particular the Carosso RG where the Langevin SDE corresponds to the well known stochastic heat equation or the Edwards-Wilkinson dynamics. We stress the advantages of this stochastic formulation of exact RG flows. While statistical field theory is usually written in infinite space, we focus here on the formulation on a large volume $L^d$ with periodic boundary conditions, in order to distinguish between extensive and intensives observables while keeping the translation-invariance. Since the empirical magnetization $m_e \equiv \frac{1}{L^d} \int_{L^d} d^d \vec x \ \phi(\vec x) $ is an intensive variable corresponding to the zero-momentum Fourier coefficient of the field, its probability distribution $p_L(m_e)$ can be obtained from the gradual integration over all the other Fourier coefficients associated to non-vanishing-momenta via exact differential RG, in order to obtain the large deviation properties with respect to the volume $L^d$.

Title: Thermodynamics of multi-colored loop models in three dimensions
Authors: Soumya Kanti Ganguly, Sumanta Mukherjee, Chandan Dasgupta
Abstract: We study order-disorder transitions in three-dimensional \textsl{multi-colored} loop models using Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the nature of the transition is intimately related to the nature of the loops. The symmetric loops undergo a first order phase transition, while the non-symmetric loops show a second-order transition. The critical exponents for the non-symmetric loops are calculated. In three dimensions, the regular loop model with no interactions is dual to the XY model. We argue that, due to interactions among the colors, the specific heat exponent is found to be different from that of the regular loop model. The continuous nature of the transition is altered to a discontinuous one due to the strong inter-color interactions.

Title: Frustration-driven topological textures on the honeycomb lattice: antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron and skyrmion crystals emerging from spiral spin liquids
Authors: M. Mohylna, F. A. Gómez Albarracín, M. Žukovič, H. Diego Rosales
Abstract: Skyrmions -topologically nontrivial magnetic quasi-particles- can emerge in two-dimensional chiral magnets due to moderate or high strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. In this work, we show that the inclusion of weak next-nearest-neighbor DM interaction in the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ honeycomb-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet leads to the emergence of field-induced incommensurate antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron pairs and antiferromagnetic skyrmion structures. Using the Luttinger-Tisza approximation and large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we report that for lower frustration values, antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron pair crystal and gas phases emerge within a small magnetic field window. In these meron phases, the fundamental unit consists of a meron-antimeron pair residing on different sublattices of the honeycomb lattice, even in the gas phase, where they exhibit greater mobility. For larger frustration, a two-layer-like three-sublattice antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystal phase is stabilized over a wider magnetic field range. At lower temperatures, this region splits into two distinct antiferromagnetic skyrmion phases with skyrmions of different sizes, reflecting the influence of frustration and thermal effects on the stabilization of these topological textures. Interestingly, both meron and skyrmion low-temperature phases connect to spiral spin liquid phases of the honeycomb lattice at higher temperatures. Additionally, we analyze the emergent single-$q$ and double-$q$ phases at low temperatures, constructing a comprehensive phase diagram.

Title: Collective migration and topological phase transitions in confluent epithelia
Authors: Leonardo Puggioni, Dimitrios Krommydas, Luca Giomi
Abstract: Collective epithelial migration leverages on topological rearrangements of the intercellular junctions, which allow cells to intercalate without loosing confluency. In silico studies have provided a clear indication that this process could occur via a two-step phase transition, where a hierarchy of topological excitations progressively transforms an epithelial layer from a crystalline solid to an isotropic liquid, via an intermediate hexatic liquid crystal phase. Yet, the fundamental mechanism behind this process and its implications for collective cell behavior are presently unknown. In this article, we show that the onset of collective cell migration in cell-resolved models of epithelial layers takes place via an activity-driven melting transition, characterized by an exponentially-divergent correlation length across the solid/hexatic phase boundary. Using a combination of numerical simulations and Renormalization Group analysis, we show that the availability of topologically distinct rearrangements - known as T1 and T2 processes - and of a non-thermal route to melting, renders the transition significantly more versatile and tunable than in two-dimensional passive matter. Specifically, the relative frequency of T1 and T2 processes and of the "bare" stiffness of the cell layer affect the divergence of positional correlations within a well-defined spectrum of critical behaviors. Suppressing T1 processes, changes the nature of the transition by preventing collective migration in favor of a cellular analog of surface sublimation.

Title: Spin Pumping in Magnetostrictive Galfenol Interfaced with Ta
Authors: Ajit Kumar Sahoo, Suchetana Mukhopadhyay, Bikram Baghira, Jeyaramane Arout Chelvane, Jyoti Ranjan Mohanty, Anjan Barman
Abstract: In view of their advantages for memory and storage applications, the quest to find suitable magnetic thin film heterostructures that can exhibit strong spin pumping effect persists in the scientific community. Here, we investigate the spin pumping phenomenon in Galfenol (FeGa) thin films by systematically varying the thickness of heavy metallic Ta underlayer (UL). Films exhibit soft magnetic properties with a bcc-phase and a notably low Gilbert damping is obtained for FeGa on Si (100). Further, we explore magnetic precessional dynamics of Ta/FeGa films using the time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect technique, revealing the presence of a resonant Kittel mode and additional strain-induced modes. The lowest value of effective Gilbert damping is obtained as $\sim$ 0.015, which rises by $\sim$65\% as the thickness of UL increases. Spin pumping and two-magnon scattering mechanisms are validated using a ballistic spin transport model. We find an overall effective spin mixing conductance value of $\sim$5.48 $\times$ $10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is the highest value ever reported in magnetostrictive films. Additionally, we performed micromagnetic simulations to understand the effect of tilted magnetic anisotropy on the formation of magnetic modes in these films. These findings in FeGa films establish it as an effective spin source material and offer innovative ideas to control spin-wave propagation and diverse applications in straintronics.

Title: Memorization and Generalization in Generative Diffusion under the Manifold Hypothesis
Authors: Beatrice Achilli, Luca Ambrogioni, Carlo Lucibello, Marc Mézard, Enrico Ventura
Abstract: We study the memorization and generalization capabilities of a Diffusion Model (DM) in the case of structured data defined on a latent manifold. We specifically consider a set of $P$ mono-modal data points in $N$ dimensions lying on a latent subspace of dimension $D = \alpha_D N$, according to the Hidden Manifold Model (HMM). Our analysis leverages the recently introduced formalism based on the statistical physics of the Random Energy Model (REM). We provide evidence for the existence of an onset time $t_{o} > t_c$ when traps appear in the potential without affecting the typical diffusive trajectory. The size of the basins of attraction of such traps is computed as a function of time. Moreover, we derive the collapse time $t_{c}$ at which trajectories fall in the basin of one of the training points, implying memorization. An explicit formula for $t_c$ is given as a function of $P$ and the ratio $\alpha_D$, proving that the curse of dimensionality issue does not hold for highly structured data, i.e. $\alpha_D\ll 1$, regardless of the non-linearity of the manifold surface. We also prove that collapse coincides with the condensation transition in the REM. Eventually, the degree of generalization of DMs is formulated in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the exact and the empirical distribution of the sampled configurations: we show the existence of an additional time $t_{g}<t_{c}<t_{o}$ such that the distance between the empirical measure of the data and the ground-truth is minimal. Counter-intuitively, the best generalization performance is found within the memorization phase of the model. We conclude that the generalization performance of DMs benefit from highly structured data since $t_g$ approaches zero faster than $t_c$ when $\alpha_D \rightarrow 0$.

Title: Pressure-Tuned Magnetism and Bandgap Modulation in Layered Fe-Doped CrCl3
Authors: Aya Ali, Govindaraj Lingannan, Lukas Gries, Md Ezaz Hasan Khan, Anas Abutaha, Kei Uemura, Masaki Mito, Vladislav Borisov, Anna Delin, Olle Eriksson, Ruediger Klingeler, Mahmoud Abdel-Hafiez
Abstract: We explore the structural, magnetic, vibrational and optical band gap properties under varying pressures. By integrating first-principles calculations with experimental techniques, including Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), uniaxial pressure studies (thermal expansion), and magnetization measurements, we unveil the intricate pressure-induced transformations in Fe-doped CrCl3, shedding light on its structural, electronic, and magnetic evolution. At ambient pressure, Raman spectra confirm all expected Raman-active modes, which exhibit blue shifts with increasing pressure. The PL measurements demonstrate an optical bandgap of 1.48 eV at ~0.6 GPa, with a progressive increase in the bandgap under pressure, transitioning slower above 6 GPa due to an isostructural phase transition. Magnetization results under pressure shows two competing magnetic components (FM and AFM) at ambient conditions, where at the lowest temperature and applied field, the FM component dominates. The presence of competing FM and AFM energy scales is confirmed by Grueneisen analysis of the thermal expansion and their uniaxial pressure dependence is determined. The experimental findings agree with theoretical results based on Density functional theory (DFT). In the experiments, we observe a pressure-enhanced ferromagnetic interlayer coupling that is followed by the stabilization of antiferromagnetic ordering, due to weakened direct interlayer interactions. Above 1.2 GPa the FM component of the magnetism is gone in the experimental observations, which is also in good agreement with DFT based theory. The findings reported here underscore the potential of CrCl3 for use in pressure-tunable magnetic and optoelectronic applications, where, e.g., the delicate balance between FM and AFM configurations could have potential for sensor applications.

Title: Spin wave interactions in the pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions
Authors: V. V. Jyothis, Kallol Mondal, Himanshu Mavani, V. Ravi Chandra
Abstract: We study the effect of magnon interactions on the spin wave spectra of the All-in-All-out phase of the pyrochlore nearest neighbour antiferromagnet with a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction $D$. The leading order corrections to spin wave energies indicate a significant renormalisation for commonly encountered strengths of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term. For low values of $D$ we find a potential instability of the phase itself, indicated by the renormalisation of magnon frequencies to negative values. We have also studied the renormalized spectra in the presence of magnetic fields along three high symmetry directions of the lattice, namely the $[111]$, $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions. Generically, we find that for a fixed value of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction renormalized spectra for the lowest band decrease with an increasing strength of the field. We have also analyzed the limits of the two magnon continuum and probed the possibility of magnon decay. For a range of $D$ and the field strength we identify possible parameter regimes where the decay of the higher bands of the system are kinematically allowed.

Title: Superspin Renormalization and Slow Relaxation in Random Spin Systems
Authors: Yi J. Zhao, Samuel J. Garratt, Joel E. Moore
Abstract: We develop an excited-state real-space renormalization group (RSRG-X) formalism to describe the dynamics of conserved densities in randomly interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems. Our formalism is suitable for systems with $\textrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, and we apply it to chains of randomly positioned spins with dipolar $XX+YY$ interactions, as arise in Rydberg quantum simulators and other platforms. The formalism generates a sequence of effective Hamiltonians which provide approximate descriptions for dynamics on successively smaller energy scales. These effective Hamiltonians involve ``superspins'': two-level collective degrees of freedom constructed from (anti)aligned microscopic spins. Conserved densities can then be understood as relaxing via coherent collective spin flips. For the well-studied simpler case of randomly interacting nearest-neighbor $XX+YY$ chains, the superspins reduce to single spins. Our formalism also leads to a numerical method capable of simulating the dynamics up to an otherwise inaccessible combination of large system size and late time. Focusing on disorder-averaged infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, in particular the local spin survival probability $\overline{S_p}(t)$, we demonstrate quantitative agreement in results between our algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) at low but nonzero frequencies. Such agreement holds for chains with nearest-neighbor, next-nearest-neighbor, and long-range dipolar interactions. Our results indicate decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$ slower than any power law and feature no significant deviation from the $\sim 1/ \log^2(t)$ asymptote expected from the infinite-randomness fixed-point of the nearest-neighbor model. We also apply the RSRG-X formalism to two-dimensional long-range systems of moderate size and find slow late-time decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$.

Title: Scalable Discrete Diffusion Samplers: Combinatorial Optimization and Statistical Physics
Authors: Sebastian Sanokowski, Wilhelm Berghammer, Martin Ennemoser, Haoyu Peter Wang, Sepp Hochreiter, Sebastian Lehner
Abstract: Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.

Abstract: The promise of quantum computation is contingent upon physical qubits with both low gate error rate and broad scalability. Silicon-based spins are a leading qubit platform, but demonstrations to date have not utilized fabrication processes capable of extending arrays in two dimensions while maintaining complete control of individual spins. Here, we implement an interconnect process, common in semiconductor manufacturing, with multiple back-end-of-line layers to show an extendable two-dimensional array of spins with fully controllable nearest-neighbor exchange interactions. In a device using three interconnect layers, we encode exchange-only qubits and achieve average single-qubit gate fidelities consistent with single-layer devices, including fidelities greater than 99.9%, as measured by blind randomized benchmarking. Moreover, with spin connectivity in two dimensions, we show that both linear and right-angle exchange-only qubits with high performance can be formed, enabling qubit array reconfigurability in the presence of defects. This extendable device platform demonstrates that industrial manufacturing techniques can be leveraged for scalable spin qubit technologies.

Title: Bose-Einstein condensation of five $α$ clusters in $^{20}$Ne and supersolidity
Authors: S. Ohkubo, J. Takahashi, Y. Yamanaka
Abstract: We show that the five $\alpha$ cluster states recently observed in $^{20}$Ne, slightly above the five $\alpha$ threshold energy, are Bose-Einstein condensates of five $\alpha$ clusters. The states are described well using a superfluid cluster model, where the order parameter is defined. We suggest that the the five $\alpha$ states are fragmented. Theory predicts the emergence of a five $\alpha$ rotational roton band characterized by a large moment of inertia. This band is formed through roton excitations of the five $\alpha$ BEC vacuum and possesses dual properties of superfluidity and crystallinity, a property of supersolidity. The persistent existence of such a roton bandis discussed and confirmed for the four $\alpha$ condensate above the four $\alpha$ threshold in $^{16}$O and the three $\alpha$ condensate above the three $\alpha$ threshold in $^{12}$C.

Title: All-optical and ultrafast control of high-order exciton-polariton orbital modes

Abstract: Exciton-polaritons flows within closed quantum circuits can spontaneously form phase-locked modes that carry orbital angular momentum (OAM). With its infinite set of angular momentum quantum numbers, high-order OAM represents a transformative solution to the bandwidth bottleneck in multiplexed optical communication. However, its practical application is hindered by the limited choice of materials which in general requires cryogenic temperatures and the reliance on mechanical switching. In this work, we achieve stable and high-order (up to order of 33) OAM modes by constructing a closed quantum circuit using the halide perovskite microcavities at room temperature. By controlling the spatial and temporal symmetry of the closed quantum circuits using another laser pulse, we achieve significant tuning OAM of EP flows from 8 to 12. Our work demonstrate all-optical and ultrafast control of high-order OAM using exciton-polariton condensates in perovskite microcavities that would have important applications in high-throughput optical communications.

Title: Solitons in Bose-Einstein Condensates with Attractive Self-Interaction on a Möbius Strip
Authors: Huan-Bo Luo, Guilong Li, Fu-Quan Dou, Bin Liu, Boris A. Malomed, Josep Batle, Yongyao Li
Abstract: We study the matter-wave solitons in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) trapped on a Möbius strip (MS), based on the respective Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation with the mean-field theory. In the linear regime, vortex states are characterized by quantum numbers, $n$ and $m$, corresponding to the transverse and circumferential directions, with the phase structure determined by the winding number (WN) $m$. Odd and even values of $n$ must associate, respectively, with integer and half-integer values of $m$, the latter ones requiring two cycles of motion around MS for returning to the initial phase. Using variational and numerical methods, we solve the GP equation with the attractive nonlinearity, producing a family of ground-state (GS) solitons for values of the norm below the critical one, above which the collapse sets in. Vortex solitons with $n=1,m=1$ and $% n=2,m=1/2$ are obtained in a numerical form. The vortex solitons with $% n=1,m=1$ are almost uniformly distributed in the azimuthal direction, while ones with $n=2,m=1/2$ form localized states. The Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion and linear-stability analysis for the GS soliton solutions and vortices with $n=1,m=1$ demonstrates that they are completely stable, while the localized states with $n=2,m=1/2$ are completely unstable. Finally, the motion of solitons on the MS and the collision of two solitons are discussed.

Title: Computational discovery of high-refractive-index van der Waals materials: The case of HfS$_2$

Abstract: New high-refractive-index dielectric materials may enhance many optical technologies by enabling efficient manipulation of light in waveguides, metasurfaces, and nanoscale resonators. Van der Waals materials are particularly promising due to their excitonic response and strong in-plane polarizability. Here we combine ab initio calculations and experiments to discover new high-refractive-index materials. Our screening highlights both known and new promising optical materials, including hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$), which shows an in-plane refractive index above 3 and large anisotropy in the visible range. We confirm these theoretical predictions through ellipsometry measurements and investigate the photonic potential of HfS$_2$ by fabricating nanodisk resonators, observing optical Mie resonances in the visible spectrum. Over the course of seven days, we observe a structural change in HfS$_2$, which we show can be mitigated by storage in either argon-rich or humidity-reduced environments. This work provides a comparative overview of high-index van der Waals materials and showcases the potential of HfS$_2$ for photonic applications in the visible spectrum.

Title: Analog charged black hole formation via percolation: Exploring cosmic censorship and Hoop conjecture
Authors: Nitesh Jaiswal, S. Shankaranarayanan (IIT Bombay)
Abstract: We investigate an analog model of charged black hole (BH) formation using the framework of classical percolation. By analyzing the scaling behavior of key quantities, including surface gravity and Komar mass, we establish a robust correspondence between this analog system and gravitational collapse in general relativity. Our numerical simulations of the lattice model show excellent agreement with analytical predictions for the continuum limit, highlighting the potential of analog systems to capture essential features of BH physics. Interestingly, we find that while geometric criteria related to the hoop conjecture are necessary, they are not sufficient for BH formation in our model. Instead, the exponential growth of energy and cluster size emerges as the key indicator, suggesting a novel interpretation of the hoop conjecture and providing further support for cosmic censorship within our analog framework by ensuring horizon formation. This work offers a fresh perspective on the organization of matter within BH event horizons and lays the groundwork for future quantum extensions that could shed light on Hawking radiation and the BH information paradox by linking entanglement entropy in quantum percolation models to BH entropy.

Title: NextGenPB: an analytically-enabled super resolution and local (de)refinement Poisson-Boltzmann Equation solver
Authors: Vincenzo Di Florio, Patrizio Ansalone, Sergii V. Siryk, Sergio Decherchi, Carlo de Falco, Walter Rocchia
Abstract: The Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE) is a relevant partial differential equation commonly used in biophysical applications to estimate the electrostatic energy of biomolecular systems immersed in electrolytic solutions. A conventional mean to improve the accuracy of its solution, when grid-based numerical techniques are used, consists in increasing the resolution, locally or globally. This, however, usually entails higher complexity, memory demand and computational cost. Here, we introduce NextGenPB, a linear PBE, adaptive-grid, FEM solver that leverages analytical calculations to maximize the accuracy-to-computational-cost ratio. Indeed, in NextGenPB (aka NGPB), analytical corrections at the surface of the solute enhance the solution's accuracy without requiring grid adaptation. This leads to more precise estimates of the electrostatic potential, fields, and energy at no perceptible additional cost. Also, we apply computationally efficient yet accurate boundary conditions by taking advantage of local grid de-refinement. To assess the accuracy of our methods directly, we expand the traditionally available analytical case set to many non-overlapping dielectric spheres. Then, we use an existing benchmark set of real biomolecular systems to evaluate the energy convergence concerning grid resolution. Thanks to these advances, we have improved state-of-the-art results and shown that the approach is accurate and largely scalable for modern high-performance computing architectures. Lastly, we suggest that the presented core ideas could be instrumental in improving the solution of other partial differential equations with discontinuous coefficients.

Title: Emerging holonomy in electron spin scattering
Authors: Lorenzo Bagnasacco, Fabio Taddei, Vittorio Giovannetti
Abstract: By evidencing the holonomic and dynamical contributions in scattering problems, we develop a method for calculating the scattering matrix of electrons in a one-dimensional coherent conductor connected to two electrodes. To validate our approach, we investigate the spin-resolved scattering of electrons along a wire subjected to a spatially varying magnetic (Zeeman) field. In particular, we show that in the high-energy limit, the transmission matrix aligns with the holonomy, reducing to a pure topological form. We illustrate the method by examining several scenarios with varied in-plane magnetic field profiles. For instance, our results indicate the possibility of achieving near-perfect spin-flip transmission, with implications for use in spintronic applications.

Title: Entanglement behavior and localization properties in monitored fermion systems
Authors: Giulia Piccitto, Giuliano Chiriacò, Davide Rossini, Angelo Russomanno
Abstract: We study the asymptotic bipartite entanglement in various integrable and nonintegrable models of monitored fermions. We find that, for the integrable cases, the entanglement versus the system size is well fitted, over more than one order of magnitude, by a function interpolating between a linear and a power-law behavior. Up to the sizes we are able to reach, a logarithmic growth of the entanglement can be also captured by the same fit with a very small power-law exponent. We thus propose a characterization of the various entanglement phases using the fitting parameters. For the nonintegrable cases, as the staggered t-V and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models, the numerics prevents us from spanning different orders of magnitude in the size, therefore we fit the asymptotic entanglement versus the measurement strength and then look at the scaling with the size of the fitting parameters. We find two different behaviors: for the SYK we observe a volume-law growth, while for the t-V model some traces of an entanglement transition emerge. In the latter models, we study the localization properties in the Hilbert space through the inverse participation ratio, finding an anomalous delocalization with no relation with the entanglement properties. Finally, we show that our function fits very well the fermionic logarithmic negativity of a quadratic model in ladder geometry with stroboscopic projective measurements.

Title: Delta-Kick Collimation of Heteronuclear Feshbach Molecules
Authors: Timothé Estrampes, José P. D'Incao, Jason R. Williams, Torben A. Schulze, Ernst M. Rasel, Éric Charron, Naceur Gaaloul
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of delta-kick collimation (DKC) applied to heteronuclear Feshbach molecules, focusing on both condensed and thermal ensembles across various interaction and temperature regimes. We demonstrate that DKC enables significant reductions in molecular cloud expansion energies and beam divergence, achieving expansion energies in the picokelvin range, comparable to state-of-the-art results obtained experimentally with atoms. Furthermore, we show that vibrational and translational motions remain strongly decoupled throughout the process, ensuring molecular stability during the delta-kick. This work paves the way for advanced experimental sequences involving degenerate ground state molecules, light-pulse molecular interferometry, and applications of dual-species precision measurements, such as testing the universality of free fall.

Title: Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States
Authors: Riccardo Rende, Luciano Loris Viteritti, Federico Becca, Antonello Scardicchio, Alessandro Laio, Giuseppe Carleo
Abstract: Foundation models are highly versatile neural-network architectures capable of processing different data types, such as text and images, and generalizing across various tasks like classification and generation. Inspired by this success, we propose Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States (FNQS) as an integrated paradigm for studying quantum many-body systems. FNQS leverage key principles of foundation models to define variational wave functions based on a single, versatile architecture that processes multimodal inputs, including spin configurations and Hamiltonian physical couplings. Unlike specialized architectures tailored for individual Hamiltonians, FNQS can generalize to physical Hamiltonians beyond those encountered during training, offering a unified framework adaptable to various quantum systems and tasks. FNQS enable the efficient estimation of quantities that are traditionally challenging or computationally intensive to calculate using conventional methods, particularly disorder-averaged observables. Furthermore, the fidelity susceptibility can be easily obtained to uncover quantum phase transitions without prior knowledge of order parameters. These pretrained models can be efficiently fine-tuned for specific quantum systems. The architectures trained in this paper are publicly available at this https URL, along with examples for implementing these neural networks in NetKet.

Title: Shadow Molecular Dynamics for a Charge-Potential Equilibration Model
Authors: Robert Stanton, Cagri Mehmet Kaymak, Anders M. N. Niklasson
Abstract: We introduce a shadow molecular dynamics (MD) approach based on the Atom-Condensed Kohn-Sham second-order (ACKS2) charge-potential equilibration model. In contrast to regular flexible charge models, the ACKS2 model includes both flexible atomic charges and potential fluctuation parameters that allow for physically correct charge fragmentation and scaling of the polarizability. Our shadow MD scheme is based on an approximation of the ACKS2's flexible charge-potential energy function, in combination with extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer MD. Utilizing this shadow charge-potential equilibration approach mitigates the costly overhead and stability problems associated with finding well-converged iterative solutions to the charges and potential fluctuations of the ACKS2 model in an MD simulation. Our work provides a robust and versatile framework for efficient, high-fidelity MD simulations of diverse physical phenomena and applications.

Title: Continuum theory of electrostatic-elastic coupling interactions in colloidal crystals
Authors: Hao Wu, Zhong-Can Ou-Yang, Rudolf Podgornik
Abstract: A mobile Coulomb gas permeating a fixed background crystalline lattice of charged colloidal crystals is subject to an electrostatic-elastic coupling, which we study on the continuum level by introducing a minimal coupling between electrostatic and displacement fields. We derive linearized, Debye-Hückel-like mean-field equations that can be analytically solved, incorporating the minimal coupling between electrostatic and displacement fields leading to an additional effective attractive interaction between mobile charges that depends in general on the strength of the coupling between the electrostatic and displacement fields. By analyzing the Gaussian fluctuations around the mean-field solution we also identify and quantify the region of its stability in terms of the electrostatic-elastic screening length. This detailed continuum theory incorporating the standard lattice elasticity and electrostatics of mobile charges provides a baseline to investigate the electrostatic-elastic coupling for microscopic models in colloid science and materials science.

Title: Unveiling UV/IR Mixing via Symmetry Defects: A View from Topological Entanglement Entropy
Authors: Jintae Kim, Yun-Tak Oh, Daniel Bulmash, Jung Hoon Han
Abstract: Some topological lattice models in two spatial dimensions exhibit intricate lattice size dependence in their ground state degeneracy (GSD). This and other features such as the position-dependent anyonic excitations are manifestations of UV/IR mixing. In the first part of this paper, we perform an exact calculation of the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) for a specific model, the rank-2 toric code. This analysis includes both contractible and non-contractible boundaries, with the minimum entropy states identified specifically for non-contractible boundaries. Our results show that TEE for a contractible boundary remains independent of lattice size, whereas TEE for non-contractible boundaries, similarly to the GSD, shows intricate lattice-size dependence. In the latter part of the paper we focus on the fact that the rank-2 toric code is an example of a translation symmetry-enriched topological phase, and show that viewing distinct lattice size as a consequence of different translation symmetry defects can explain both our TEE results and the GSD of the rank-2 toric code. Our work establishes the translation symmetry defect framework as a robust description of the UV/IR mixing in topological lattice models.

Abstract: We propose a two-dimensional (2d) quantum breakdown model of hardcore bosons interacting with disordered spins which would be classical without the bosons. It resembles particles incident into supersaturated vapor. The model exhibits a set of subsystem symmetries, and has a strong fragmentation into Krylov subspaces in each symmetry sector. The Hamiltonian in each Krylov subspace maps to a single-particle problem in a Cayley tree-like graph. At zero disorder, the Krylov subspaces exhibit either (possible) integrable features, or quantum chaos with quantum scar states showing irregular energy and degeneracy patterns. At nonzero disorders, they enter a 2d many-body localization (MBL) phase beyond certain disorder strength $W_*$, as indicated by Poisson level spacing statistics and entanglement entropy growing as $\log t$ with time $t$. Our theoretical arguments suggest $W_*$ is finite or zero for boson number $N_b\lesssim L^\gamma/\log L$ ($1/2\le \gamma \le 1$) as system size $L\rightarrow\infty$. This gives a more stringent condition for MBL than that in the 1d quantum breakdown models. This model reveals the possibility of MBL in systems of quantum particles interacting with classical degrees of freedom.

Title: Helicity modulus and chiral symmetry breaking for boundary conditions with finite twist
Authors: Gaurav Khairnar, Thomas Vojta
Abstract: We study the response of a two-dimensional classical XY model to a finite (non-infinitesimal) twist of the boundary conditions. We use Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the free energy difference between periodic and twisted-periodic boundary conditions and find deviations from the expected quadratic dependence on the twist angle. Consequently, the helicity modulus (spin-stiffness) shows a non-trivial dependence on the twist angle. We show that the deviation from the expected behavior arises because of the mixing of states with opposite chirality which leads to an additional entropy contribution in the quasi-long-range ordered phase. We give an improved prescription for the numerical evaluation of the helicity modulus for a finite twist, and we discuss the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry for the anti-periodic boundary conditions. We also discuss applications to discrete spin systems and some experimental scenarios where boundary conditions with finite twist are necessary.

Title: Signatures of two gaps in the spin susceptibility of a cuprate superconductor
Authors: R. Zhou, I. Vinograd, M. Hirata, T. Wu, H. Mayaffre, S. Krämer, W.N. Hardy, R. Liang, D.A. Bonn, T. Loew, J. Porras, B. Keimer, M.-H. Julien
Abstract: A major obstacle to understanding high-Tc cuprates is that superconductivity precludes observing normal-state properties at low temperatures. One prime example is the normal-state spin susceptibility \c{hi}spin: although its decrease upon cooling far above Tc typifies pseudogap behavior, its behavior at low temperatures is generally unknown. Here, our measurements in high magnetic fields expose \c{hi}spin of YBa2Cu3Oy down to low temperatures. Even though superconductivity is suppressed by the field, we uncover two thermally-activated contributions alongside a residual \c{hi}spin(T=0) due to gapless excitations. We relate these two distinct gaps to short-range charge-density waves and to the formation of singlets as in certain quantum spin systems. Both phenomena thus contribute to the pseudogap at low temperature, supplementing short-lived antiferromagnetism that initiates pseudogap behavior at high temperatures. We therefore propose that the pseudogap ought to be regarded as a composite property and that, when not undergoing spin-stripe ordering, underdoped cuprates tend to form short-ranged spin singlets.

Title: The trimer paradox: the effect of stiff constraints on equilibrium distributions in overdamped dynamics
Authors: Radost Waszkiewicz, Maciej Lisicki
Abstract: We reconsider the classical problem of a freely joined chain of Brownian particles connected by elastic springs and study its conformational probability distribution function in the overdamped regime in the limit of infinite stiffness of constraints. We show that the well-known solution by Fixman [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 71, 3050 (1974)] is missing a shape-related term, later alluded to but not computed by Helfand [J. Chem. Phys 71, 5000 (1979)]. In our approach, the shape term, also termed zero-point energy, arises explicitly from a careful treatment of the distributional limit. We present a computationally feasible method for the calculation of the shape term and demonstrate its validity in a couple of examples.

Title: Heavy Fermions as an Efficient Representation of Atomistic Strain and Relaxation in Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Jiabin Yu, Dumitru Călugăru, Haoyu Hu, Nicolas Regnault, Oskar Vafek, Jian Kang, B. Andrei Bernevig
Abstract: Although the strongly interacting flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) have been approached using the minimal Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM) Hamiltonian, there is mounting evidence that strain and lattice relaxation are essential in correctly determining the order of the correlated insulator groundstates. These effects can be incorporated in an enhanced continuum model by introducing additional terms computed from the relaxation profile. To develop an analytical and physical understanding of these effects, we include strain and relaxation in the topological heavy fermion (HF) model of TBG. We find that strain and relaxation are very well captured in first order perturbation theory by projection onto the fully symmetric HF Hilbert space, and remarkably do not alter the interacting terms in the periodic Anderson model. Their effects are fully incorporated in the single-particle HF Hamiltonian, and can be reproduced in a minimal model with only 4 symmetry-breaking terms. Our results demonstrate that the heavy fermion framework of TBG is an efficient and robust representation of the perturbations encountered in experiment.

Title: Gaussian approximation of dynamic cavity equations for linearly-coupled stochastic dynamics
Authors: Mattia Tarabolo, Luca Dall'Asta
Abstract: Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models. However, due to their cavity formulation, the present method can also be applied to ensembles of sparse random graphs and employed as a message-passing algorithm on specific graph instances.

Title: Tunable Topological Phases in Quantum Kirigamis
Authors: Rahul Singh, Adhip Agarwala
Abstract: Advances in engineering mesoscopic quantum devices have led to new material platforms where electronic transport can be achieved on foldable structures. In this respect, we study quantum phases and their transitions on a Kirigami structure, a Japanese craft form, where its individual building blocks are topologically non-trivial. In particular, we find that by mechanically deforming the Kirigami structure one can engineer topological phase transitions in the system. Using a multipronged approach, we show that the physics of the system can be captured within a transfer matrix formalism akin to Chalker-Coddington networks, where the junctions describe scattering between effective non-Hermitian one-dimensional edge channels. We further show that the nature of the Kirigami structure can affect the critical folding angles where the topological phase transitions occur. Our study shows the rich interplay between topological quantum phenomena and structural configuration of an underlying Kirigami network reflecting its potential as an intriguing platform.

Title: Dopant pairing in a disordered magnetic spin ladder
Authors: K. Knakkergaard Nielsen
Abstract: I demonstrate a pairing mechanism of dopants in a magnetic lattice, emerging from the underlying high-temperature disorder of the spins. The effect is demonstrated in a mixed-dimensional model, where dopants travel along a two-leg ladder, while the spins feature Ising interactions along the rungs and the legs of the ladder. The dynamics following the sudden immersion of two nearest neighbor dopants in an infinite temperature spin lattice shows that thermal spin disorder frustrates the relative motion of the dopants and enforces them to co-propagate. The predictions are shown to be realistically testable in quantum simulation experiments.

Title: Deconfined quantum criticality of frustrated hard-core dipolar bosons
Authors: Ya-Nan Wang, Wen-Long You, Wen-Yi Zhang, Su-Peng Kou, Gaoyong Sun
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) are proposed as unconventional second-order phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. The nature and experimental realizations of DQCPs are crucial issues of importance. We illustrate the potential for DQCPs between the valence bond solid state and the antiferromagnetic phase to arise in optical lattices containing frustrated dipolar bosons subject to hard-core constraints. The emergence of DQCPs is comprehended through the fusion of two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions. The DQCPs and the BKTs are confirmed by the scaling of ground-state fidelity susceptibilities in finite systems and the analysis of order parameters obtained from infinite systems. The numerical analysis reveals varying critical exponents of the correlation length in DQCPs and the logarithmic scaling in BKTs, respectively. This work offers a promising platform for realizing DQCPs and provides valuable insights into their nature within the framework of topological phase transitions.

Title: Quantum Spin Relaxation with THz Attempt Frequency in the 1/3-Fire, 2/3-Ice Ferrimagnet SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$
Authors: M. L. McLanahan, A. P. Ramirez
Abstract: Ferrimagnets in which half the spins are disordered and half ordered, so-called half-fire, half-ice state, have been advanced theoretically as a route towards realizing exotic magnetic ground states. Here we demonstrate novel single-spin resonance in SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$, a 1/3-fire, 2/3-ice material. Using ac-susceptibility in the frequency range 0.1 Hz - 1 kHz we find a Debye-like resonance with Orbach relaxation temperature dependence, yielding an energy barrier $E_B \approx 840$ $k_B$ and attempt frequencies in the THz range. These quantities strongly suggest single-spin relaxation among paramagnetic Sm spins where the flipping field is provided by the FM-ordered Mn spins at domain boundaries, a direct outcome of the 1/3-fire, 2/3-ice state.

Title: Instability of the engineered dark state in two-band fermions under number-conserving dissipative dynamics
Authors: A. A. Lyublinskaya, P. A. Nosov, I. S. Burmistrov
Abstract: Correlated quantum many-body states can be created and controlled by the dissipative protocols. Among these, particle number-conserving protocols are particularly appealing due to their ability to stabilize topologically nontrivial phases. Is there any fundamental limitation to their performance? We address this question by examining a general class of models involving a two-band fermion system subjected to dissipation designed to transfer fermions from the upper band to the lower band. By construction, these models have a guaranteed steady state - a dark state - with a completely filled lower band and an empty upper band. In the limit of weak dissipation, we derive equations governing the long-wavelength and long-time dynamics of the fermion densities and analyze them numerically. These equations belong to the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov reaction-diffusion universality class. Our analysis reveals that the engineered dark state is generically unstable, giving way to a new steady state with a finite density of particles in the upper band. We also estimate the minimum system sizes required to observe this instability in finite systems. Our results suggest that number-conserving dissipative protocols may not be a reliable universal tool for stabilizing dark states.

Title: First return times on sparse random graphs
Authors: Oleg Evnin, Weerawit Horinouchi
Abstract: We consider random walks in the form of nearest-neighbor hopping on Erdos-Renyi random graphs of finite fixed mean degree c as the number of vertices N tends to infinity. In this regime, using statistical field theory methods, we develop an analytic theory of the first return time probability distribution. The problem turns out closely related to finding the spectrum of the normalized graph Laplacian that controls the continuum time version of the nearest-neighbor-hopping random walk. In the infinite graph limit, where loops are highly improbable, the returns operate in a manner qualitatively similar to c-regular trees, and the expressions for probabilities resemble those on random c-regular graphs. Because the vertex degrees are not exactly constant, however, the way c enters the formulas differs from the dependence on the graph degree of first return probabilities on random regular graphs.

Title: Magneto-optical spectra of an organic antiferromagnet as a candidate for altermagnet
Authors: Satoshi Iguchi, Hiroki Kobayashi, Yuka Ikemoto, Tetsuya Furukawa, Hirotake Itoh, Shinichiro Iwai, Taro Moriwaki, Takahiko Sasaki
Abstract: We measured the magneto-optical Kerr effect in an orthorhombic organic antiferromagnet $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Cl, which is a candidate for altermagnets. From the Maxwell equations, we obtained matrix-type general formulae describing the optical propagation and reflection for arbitrary crystals. These formulae enabled us to correctly measure and obtain the off-diagonal optical responses from the anisotropic organic crystal, which appeared at around the Néel temperature and exhibited a nonlinear field dependence in the antiferromagnetic phase. These results eliminate the net canted-magnetization origin. The obtained off-diagonal optical conductivity spectra for almost entire $\pi$-electron band clearly shows two spectral end-peaks due to magnetic origin with a large energy scale compared with the very small spin-orbit interaction, and proportionality to anisotropic diagonal conductivities possibly in relation to the piezomagnetic effect. These results suggest the altermagnetic response of this material. We also discuss the analogy between the magnetization in ferromagnets and Néel vector with respect to the magneto-optical configurations.

Title: Memory of rotation in residual stress of paste
Authors: Hiroki Matsuda, Michio Otsuki
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stress distribution in pastes after horizontal rotation by using an elasto-plastic model. Residual stress remains as a memory of rotation. The stress in the circumferential direction increases after the rotation, whereas that in the radial direction decreases. The residual stress is analytically related to the plastic deformation induced by the rotation. Based on the time evolution of plastic deformation, we theoretically describe the mechanism of the changes in the stress distribution.

Title: Unsupervised Tracking of Local and Collective Defects Dynamics in Metals Under Deformation
Authors: Matteo Cioni, Mattia Perrone, Massimo Delle Piane, Giovanni Maria Pavan
Abstract: Metals owe their unique mechanical properties to how defects emerge and propagate within their crystal structure under stress. However, the mechanisms leading from the early emerging (local) defects to the amplification of dislocations (collective plastic events) are not easy to track. Here, using tensile-stress atomistic simulations of a Copper lattice as a case study, we revisit this classical problem under a new perspective based on local dynamics rather than on purely structural arguments. We use a data-driven approach that allows tracking how local fluctuations emerge and accumulate in the atomic lattice in space and time, anticipating/determining the emergence of local or collective structural defects during deformation. Building solely on the general concepts of local fluctuations and spatiotemporal fluctuation correlations, this approach allows characterizing in a unique way the evolution through the elastic, plastic, and fracture phases, describing metals as complex systems where collective phenomena originate from local dynamical triggering events.

Title: Room temperature Multiferroicity and Magnetoelectric coupling in Ca/Mn modified BaTiO3
Authors: P. Maneesha, Koyal Suman Samantaray, Rakhi Saha, Rajashri Urkude, Biplab Ghosh, Arjun K Pathak, Indranil Bhaumik, Abdelkrim Mekki, Khalil Harrabi, Somaditya Sen
Abstract: Materials with magnetoelectric coupling (MEC) between ferroic orders at room temperature are emerging field in modern technology and physics. BaTiO3 is a robust ferroelectric in which several doping has led to MEC. In Ca and Mn modified BaTiO3 has been study with a series of Ba(1-x)Ca(x)Ti(1-y)Mn(y)O3 (x=y= 0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09), in this MEC was only observed in x=0.03. The structural modifications with changing substitution reveal a reduced Ti-O-Ti bond angle for this sample which is the most ferromagnetic in nature. A mixed phase of tetragonal P4mm and hexagonal P63/mmc space groups of BaTiO3 is observed in the substituted samples, with nominal contribution of the hexagonal phase for x=0.03. A valence state study using XPS and XANES reveals the presence of enhanced proportion of Mn3+ ions in the sample which support a pseudo Jahn-Teller distortion, thereby supporting the ferroelectricity for x=0.03. Direct evidences of MEC was obtained from magnetoelectric measurements. A magnetoelectric coupling coefficient, {\alpha}ME ~88 mVcm-1Oe-1 was obtained for dc magnetic field of 600 Oe and a 10Hz ac field of 40 Oe. Such MEC was not observed for higher substitution which emphasizes the sensitivity of the structural properties on substitution.

Title: Physical meaning of principal component analysis for classical lattice systems with translational invariance
Authors: Su-Chan Park
Abstract: We explore the physical implications of applying principal component analysis (PCA) to translationally invariant classical systems defined on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice. Using Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory, we demonstrate that the principal components are related to the reciprocal lattice vectors of the hypercubic lattice, and the corresponding eigenvalues are connected to the discrete Fourier transform of the sampled configurations. From a different perspective, we show that the PCA in question can be viewed as a numerical method for computing the ensemble average of the squared moduli of the Fourier transform of physical quantities. Our results also provide a way to determine approximately the principal components of a classical system with translational invariance without the need for matrix diagonalization.

Title: Diffusion with preferential relocation in a confining potential
Authors: Denis Boyer, Martin R. Evans, Satya N. Majumdar
Abstract: We study the relaxation of a diffusive particle confined in an arbitrary external potential and subject to a non-Markovian resetting protocol. With a constant rate $r$, a previous time $\tau$ between the initial time and the present time $t$ is chosen from a given probability distribution $K(\tau,t)$, and the particle is reset to the position that it occupied at time $\tau$. Depending on the shape of $K(\tau,t)$, the particle either relaxes toward the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution or toward a non-trivial stationary distribution that breaks ergodicity and depends on the initial position and the resetting protocol. From a general asymptotic theory, we find that if the kernel $K(\tau,t)$ is sufficiently localized near $\tau=0$, i.e., mostly the initial part of the trajectory is remembered and revisited, the steady state is non-Gibbs-Boltzmann. Conversely, if $K(\tau,t)$ decays slowly enough or increases with $\tau$, i.e., recent positions are more likely to be revisited, the probability distribution of the particle tends toward the Gibbs-Boltzmann state at large times. In the latter case, however, the temporal approach to the stationary state is generally anomalously slow, following for instance an inverse power law or a stretched exponential, if $K(\tau,t)$ is not too strongly peaked at the current time $t$. These findings are verified by the analysis of several exactly solvable cases and by numerical simulations.

Title: A new special function related to a discrete Gauss-Poisson distribution and some physics of the cell model with Curie-Weiss interactions
Authors: O. A. Dobush, M. A. Shpot
Abstract: Inspired by previous studies in statistical physics [see, in particular, Kozitsky at al., A phase transition in a Curie-Weiss system with binary interactions, Condens. Matter Phys. 23, 23502 (2020)] we introduce a discrete Gauss-Poisson probability distribution function \begin{equation}\label{GPD}\tag{A1} p_{GP}(n ;z,r)=\left[R(r;z)\right]^{-1}\frac{\mbox{e}^{zn}}{n!}\,\mbox{e}^{-\frac 12\,rn^2} \end{equation} with support on $\mathbb N_0$ and parameters $z\in\mathbb R$ and $r\in\mathbb R_+$. The probability mass function $p_{GP}(n ;z,r)$ is normalized by the special function $R(r;z)$, given by the infinite sum \begin{equation}\label{R}\tag{A2} R(r;z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{\mbox{e}^{zn}}{n!}\,\mbox{e}^{-\frac 12\,rn^2}, \end{equation} possessing extremely intersting mathematical properties. We present an asymptotic estimate $R^{(\rm as)}(r;z\gg1)$ for the function $R(r;z)$ with large arguments $z$, along with similar formulas for its logarithm and logarithmic derivative. These functions exhibit very interesting oscillatory behavior around their asymptotics, for parameters $r$ above some threshold value $r^*$. Some implications of our findings are discussed in the context of the Curie-Weiss cell model of simple fluids.

Title: Time-translation invariance symmetry breaking hidden by finite-scale singularities
Authors: Ixandra Achitouv, Vincent Lahoche, Dine Ousmane Samary, Parham Radpay
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a renormalization group perspective on the quantum dynamics of a particle moving in the Euclidean $\mathbb{R}^N$ space through the complex landscape provided by a disordered Hamiltonian of type $2+p$. We focus on the large $N$ limit, where the coarse-graining procedure is unconventional: it is based on the Wigner spectrum of the rank-2 disorder. The main consequence of this choice is that canonical dimensions depend on the scale, and the flow equations fail to become autonomous, preventing the existence of global fixed points. One of the main features of the underlying renormalization group flow is the existence of finite-scale singularities for initial conditions sufficiently close to the Gaussian region and for rank-$p$ disorder intensity large enough. Using the Luttinger-Ward formalism, we show that these finite-scale singularities hide (and should be resolved by) a phase transition that breaks time-translation invariance.

Title: Sulfur in diamond and its effect on the creation of nitrogen-vacancy defect from \textit{ab initio} simulations
Authors: Nima Ghafari Cherati, Anton Pershin, Ádám Gali
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most significant and widely studied defects in diamond that plays a prominent role in quantum technologies. The precise engineering of the location and concentration of NV centers is of great importance in quantum technology applications. To this end, irradiation techniques such as nitrogen-molecule ion implantation are applied. Recent studies have reported enhanced NV center creation and activation efficiencies introduced by nitrogen molecule ion implantation in doped diamond layers, where the maximum creation efficiency at $\sim75$\% has been achieved in sulfur-doped layers. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind these observations and the limits of the efficiencies are far from understood. In this study, we employ hybrid density functional theory calculations to compute the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the magneto-optical properties of various sulfur defects in diamond where we also consider the interaction of sulfur and hydrogen in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers. Our results imply that the competition between the donor substitutional sulfur and the hyper-deep acceptor sulfur-vacancy complex is an important limiting factor on the creation efficiency of the NV center in diamond. However, both species are able to trap interstitial hydrogen from diamond, which favorably mediates the creation of NV centers in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers.

Title: The balance between paraelectricity and ferroelectricity in non-chiral smectic homologs
Authors: Dorota Węgłowska, Michał Czerwiński, Robert Dzienisiewicz, Paweł Perkowski, Jadwiga Szydłowska, Damian Pociecha, Mateusz Mrukiewicz
Abstract: Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.

Title: Ohm's law, Joule heat, and Planckian dissipation
Authors: Hiroyasu Koizumi
Abstract: Previously, we have shown that the gradient of the chemical potential force arises from the time-component of the Berry connection from many-electron wave functions. We will demonstrate the importance of it in electron conduction problems in metals in this work. We first revisit the well-studied dissipation problem, Joule heating by electric current in a metallic wire connected to an electric battery. It is known that Poynting's theorem explains it in a strange manner: The energy for the Joule heating enters from the outside of the wire as radiation. We show that a sensible explanation is given if the generation of the current is due to the chemical potential gradient generated inside the wire by the battery connection. Next, we demonstrate its importance in the discharging of a capacitor problem where the capacitor plays a role of a battery; and the tunneling supercurrent through the Josephson junction problem, where the original derivation of the Josephson relation does not include the capacitor contribution inherently exists in the junction. Lastly, we argue that the gauge fluctuation of the time-component of the Berry connection included in the chemical potential gradient force explains the Planckian dissipation observed in strange metals.

Title: Optical absorption and luminescence of $α$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ from the Bethe Salpeter Equation
Authors: Claudio Garcia, Walter R. L. Lambrecht
Abstract: $\alpha$-Li$_x$V$_2$O$_5$ is obtained by intercalating Li between the layers of V$_2$O$_5$. The partial filling of the split-off conduction band by electron donation from Li leads to significant changes in optical properties. Here we study the electronic band structure of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ using quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ calculations and the optical dielectric function by means of the Bethe Salpeter equation. We find a very strong optical absorption band related to transitions between the filled V-$d_{xy}$ like states to the empty ones with strong polarization along the $a$-direction. We relate this to recent experimental observations of cathodoluminescence (CL) in which a supression of the CL was observed upon addition of Li.

Title: Influence of coupling symmetries and noise on the critical dynamics of synchronizing oscillator lattices
Authors: Ricardo Gutierrez, Rodolfo Cuerno
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the synchronization process in lattices of self-sustained (phase and limit-cycle) oscillators displays universal scale-invariant behavior previously studied in the physics of surface kinetic roughening. The type of dynamic scaling ansatz which is verified depends on the randomness that occurs in the system, whether it is columnar disorder (quenched noise given by the random assignment of natural frequencies), leading to anomalous scaling, or else time-dependent noise, inducing the more standard Family-Vicsek dynamic scaling ansatz, as in equilibrium critical dynamics. The specific universality class also depends on the coupling function: for a sine function (as in the celebrated Kuramoto model) the critical behavior is that of the Edwards-Wilkinson equation for the corresponding type of randomness, with Gaussian fluctuations around the average growth. In all the other cases investigated, Tracy-Widom fluctuations ensue, associated with the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation for rough interfaces. Two questions remain to be addressed in order to complete the picture, however: 1) Is the atypical scaling displayed by the sine coupling preserved if other coupling functions satisfying the same (odd) symmetry are employed (as suggested by continuum approximations and symmetry arguments)? and 2) how does the competition between both types of randomness (which are expected to coexist in experimental settings) affect the nonequilibrium behavior? We address the latter question by numerically characterizing the crossover between thermal-noise and columnar-disorder criticality, and the former by providing evidence confirming that it is the symmetry of the coupling function that sets apart the sine coupling, among other odd-symmetric couplings, due to the absence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations.

Title: Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses
Authors: Adil A. Gangat
Abstract: Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of heuristic approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much more rugged planted-solution instances. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $<$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. A theoretical implication of our algorithm is that only quantum algorithms with sublinear time complexity may have time-complexity quantum advantage for heuristic approximate optimization of classical spin glasses that have decaying correlations. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.

Title: Hyperparameter Optimization and Force Error Correction of Neuroevolution Potential for Predicting Thermal Conductivity of Wurtzite GaN
Authors: Zhuo Chen, Yuejin Yuan, Wenyang Ding, Shouhang Li, Meng An, Gang Zhang
Abstract: As a representative of wide-bandgap semiconductors, wurtzite gallium nitride (GaN) has been widely utilized in high-power devices due to high breakdown voltage and low specific on resistance. Accurate prediction of wurtzite GaN thermal conductivity is a prerequisite for designing effective thermal management systems of electronic applications. Machine learning driven molecular dynamics simulation offers a promising approach to predicting the thermal conductivity of large-scale systems without requiring predefined parameters. However, these methods often underestimate the thermal conductivity of materials with inherently high thermal conductivity due to the large predicted force error compared with first-principle calculation, posing a critical challenge for their broader application. In this study, we successfully developed a neuroevolution potential for wurtzite GaN and accurately predicted its thermal conductivity, 259 W/m-K at room temperatue, achieving excellent agreement with reported experimental measurements. The hyperparameters of neuroevolution potential (NEP) were optimized based on systematic analysis of reproduced energy and force, structural feature, computational efficiency. Furthermore, a force prediction error correction method was implemented, effectively reducing the error caused by the additional force noise in the Langevin thermostat by extrapolating to the zero-force error limit. This study provides valuable insights and hold significant implication for advancing efficient thermal management technologies in wide bandgap semiconductor devices.

Title: Softening of Vibrational Modes and Anharmonicity Induced Thermal Conductivity Reduction in a-Si:H at High Temperatures
Authors: Zhuo Chen, Yuejin Yuan, Yanzhou Wang, Penghua Ying, Shouhang Li, Cheng Shao, Wenyang Ding, Gang Zhang, Meng An
Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) has garnered considerable attention in the semiconductor industry, particularly for its use in solar cells and passivation layers for high performance silicon solar cells, owing to its exceptional photoelectric properties and scalable manufacturing processes. A comprehensive understanding of thermal transport mechanism in a-Si:H is essential for optimizing thermal management and ensuring the reliable operation of these devices. In this study, we developed a neuroevolution machine learning potential based on first-principles calculations of energy, forces, and virial, which enables accurate modeling of interatomic interactions in both a-Si:H and a-Si systems. Using the homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (HNEMD) method, we systematically investigated the thermal conductivity of a-Si:H and a-Si across a temperature range of 300-1000 K and hydrogen concentrations ranging from 6 to 12 at%. Our simulation results found that thermal conductivity of a-Si:H with 12 at% hydrogen was significantly reduced by 12% compared to that of a-Si at 300 K. We analyzed the spectral thermal conductivity, vibrational density of states and lifetimes of vibrational modes, and revealed the softening of vibrational modes and anharmonicity effects contribute to the reduction of thermal conductivity as temperature and hydrogen concentration increase. Furthermore, the influence of hydrogen concentration and temperature on diffuson and propagon contribution to thermal conductivity of a-Si:H was revealed. This study provides valuable insights for developing thermal management strategies in silicon-based semiconducting devices and advances the understanding of thermal transport in amorphous systems.

Title: Microscopic Origin of Reduced Magnetic Order in a Frustrated Metal
Authors: X. Boraley, O. Stockert, J. Lass, R. Sibille, Ø. S. Fjellvåg, S. Moody, A. M. Läuchli, V. Fritsch, D. G. Mazzone
Abstract: Although magnetic frustration in metals provides a promising avenue for novel quantum phenomena, their microscopic interpretation is often challenging. Here we use the face-centered cubic intermetallic HoInCu$_4$ as model material to show that Hamiltonians neglecting the charge degree of freedom are appropriate for frustrated metals possessing low density of states at the Fermi surface. Through neutron scattering techniques we determine matching magnetic exchange interactions in the paramagnetic and field-polarized states using an effective spin-1 Heisenberg Hamiltonian, for which we identify antiferromagnetic nearest and next-nearest neighbour interactions $J_1$ and $J_2$ that are close to the critical ratio $J_2$/$J_1$ = 1/2. The study further provides evidence that spin-wave theory fails to predict the low-energy spin dynamics in the antiferromagnetic zero-field state, which is dominated by overdamped magnetic excitations. We conclude that the low-energy fluctuations arise from quantum fluctuations, accounting for the missing moment of the strongly renormalized magnetic long-range order.

Title: A universal route from avalanches in mean-field models with random fields to stochastic Poisson branching events
Authors: Jordi Baró, Álvaro Corral
Abstract: Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.

Title: Local topological order and boundary algebras
Authors: Corey Jones, Pieter Naaijkens, David Penneys, Daniel Wallick
Abstract: We introduce a set of axioms for locally topologically ordered quantum spin systems in terms of nets of local ground state projections, and we show they are satisfied by Kitaev's Toric Code and Levin-Wen type models. For a locally topologically ordered spin system on $\mathbb{Z}^{k}$, we define a local net of boundary algebras on $\mathbb{Z}^{k-1}$, which provides a mathematically precise algebraic description of the holographic dual of the bulk topological order. We construct a canonical quantum channel so that states on the boundary quasi-local algebra parameterize bulk-boundary states without reference to a boundary Hamiltonian. As a corollary, we obtain a new proof of a recent result of Ogata [Ann. H. Poincaré 25, 2024] that the bulk cone von Neumann algebra in the Toric Code is of type $\rm{II}$, and we show that Levin-Wen models can have cone algebras of type $\rm{III}$. Finally, we argue that the braided tensor category of DHR bimodules for the net of boundary algebras characterizes the bulk topological order in (2+1)D, and can also be used to characterize the topological order of boundary states.

Title: Observation of thermal microwave photons with a Josephson junction detector
Authors: A. L. Pankratov, A. V. Gordeeva, A. V. Chiginev, L. S. Revin, A. V. Blagodatkin, N. Crescini, L. S. Kuzmin
Abstract: When measuring electromagnetic radiation of frequency $f$, the most sensitive detector is the one that counts the single quanta of energy $h f$. Single photon detectors (SPDs) were demonstrated from $\gamma$-rays to infrared wavelengths, and extending this range down to the microwaves is the focus of intense research. The energy of $10\,\mathrm{GHz}$ microwave photon, about $40\,\mathrm{\mu eV}$ or $7\, \mathrm{yJ},$ is enough to force a superconducting Josephson junction into its resistive state, making it suitable to be used as a sensor. In this work, we use an underdamped Josephson junction to detect single thermal photons stochastically emitted by a microwave copper cavity at millikelvin temperatures. After characterizing the source and detector, we vary the temperature of the resonant cavity and measure the increased photon rate. The device shows an efficiency up to 40% and a dark count rate of $0.1\,\mathrm{Hz}$ in a bandwidth of several gigahertz. To confirm the thermal nature of the emitted photons we verify their super-Poissonian statistics, which is also a signature of quantum chaos. We discuss detector application in the scope of Dark Matter Axion searches, and note its importance for quantum information, metrology and fundamental physics.

Title: Dynamical localization in 2D topological quantum random walks
Authors: D. O. Oriekhov, Guliuxin Jin, Eliska Greplova
Abstract: We study the dynamical localization of discrete time evolution of topological split-step quantum random walk (QRW) on a single-site defect starting from a uniform distribution. Using analytical and numerical calculations, we determine the high localization probability regions in the parameter space of the quantum walker. These regions contain two or more pairs of trapped states, forming near a lattice defect. By investigating the spectral properties of the discrete-time evolution operators, we show that these trapped states have large overlap with the initial uniformly distributed state, thus offering a simple interpretation of the localization effect. As this localization scheme could be interpreted as a variation of spatial quantum search algorithm, we compare the localization probability and time with other types of two-dimensional quantum walks that do not have topological phases and realize localization time scaling similar to Grover's algorithm. Finally we show that mechanism of localization we identified is robust against the influence of disorder.

Title: Black Box Work Extraction and Composite Hypothesis Testing
Authors: Kaito Watanabe, Ryuji Takagi
Abstract: Work extraction is one of the most central processes in quantum thermodynamics. However, the prior analysis of optimal extractable work has been restricted to a limited operational scenario where complete information about the initial state is given. Here, we introduce a general framework of black box work extraction, which addresses the inaccessibility of information on the initial state. We show that the optimal extractable work in the black box setting is completely characterized by the performance of a composite hypothesis testing task, a fundamental problem in information theory. We employ this general relation to reduce the asymptotic black box work extraction to the quantum Stein's lemma in composite hypothesis testing, allowing us to provide their exact characterization in terms of the Helmholtz free energy. We also show a new quantum Stein's lemma motivated in this physical setting, where a composite hypothesis contains a certain correlation. Our work exhibits the importance of information about the initial state and gives a new interpretation of the quantities in the composite quantum hypothesis testing, encouraging the interplay between the physical settings and the information theory.

Title: Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality for dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential
Authors: Tsubasa Sakamoto, Ryosuke Yoshii, Shunji Tsuchiya
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as introduced by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of noninvasive measurement. In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.

Title: A fluctuation-dissipation theorem perspective on radiative responses to temperature perturbations
Authors: Fabrizio Falasca, Aurora Basinski-Ferris, Laure Zanna, Ming Zhao
Abstract: Radiative forcing drives warming in the Earth system, leading to changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated radiative feedbacks. The link between changes in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) net radiative flux and SST patterns, known as the "pattern effect", is typically diagnosed by studying the response of atmosphere-only models to SST perturbations. In this work, we diagnose the pattern effect through response theory, by performing idealized warming perturbation experiments from unperturbed data alone. First, by studying the response at short time scales, where the response is dominated by atmospheric variability, we recover results that agree with the literature. Second, by extending the framework to longer time scales, we capture coupled interactions between the slow ocean component and the atmosphere, yielding a novel "sensitivity map" quantifying the response of the net radiative flux to SST perturbations in the coupled system. Here, feedbacks are captured by a spatiotemporal response operator, rather than time-independent maps as in traditional studies. Both formulations skillfully reconstruct changes in externally forced simulations and provide practical strategies for climate studies. The key distinction lies in their perspectives on climate feedbacks. The first formulation, closely aligned with prediction tasks, follows the traditional view in which slow variables, such as SSTs, exert a one-way influence on fast variables. The second formulation broadens this perspective by incorporating spatiotemporal interactions across state variables. This alternative approach explores how localized SST perturbations can alter the coupled dynamics, leading to temperature changes in remote areas and further impacting the radiative fluxes at later times.

Title: Leveraging spurious Omori-Utsu relation in the nearest-neighbor declustering method
Authors: Andreu Puy, Jordi Baró, Jörn Davidsen, Romualdo Pastor-Satorras
Abstract: Static and dynamic stress changes in the Earth's crust induced by an earthquake typically trigger other earthquakes. Identifying such aftershocks is an important step in seismic hazard assessment but has remained challenging, especially in cases involving natural fluid migration or anthropogenic fluid injections, which can occur with varying time scales and/or episodically, leading to strong temporal variations in earthquake occurrences. Here, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that earthquake catalogs without triggering can lead to spurious Omori-Utsu and productivity relations for the commonly used nearest-neighbor declustering method. However, we show that the robustness of the Omori-Utsu exponent on newly introduced parameters of the method allows one to determine whether indeed aftershocks are present. For a natural swarm catalog, which lacks a clear distinction between triggered and background events, we find that the catalog is dominated by aftershocks.

Title: Small Singular Values Matter: A Random Matrix Analysis of Transformer Models
Authors: Max Staats, Matthias Thamm, Bernd Rosenow
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to AI applications, understanding their inner workings is essential. In this work, we analyze the spectra of weight matrices in pretrained transformer models through the lens of random matrix theory (RMT) to uncover learned structures. We find that certain regions of the weight matrix spectra deviate markedly from RMT predictions, indicating richer feature encoding. By comparing the corresponding singular vectors to eigenvectors of activation covariance matrices, we observe substantial overlap precisely where the spectra deviate from RMT expectations. Our analysis further reveals the important role of small singular values in LLMs, showing that these values contain significant information, a claim supported by increased perplexity when they are removed from the model. Although these small values may appear unimportant prior to task-specific fine-tuning, removing them afterward significantly degrades performance, revealing that fine-tuning refines the model primarily in these spectral regions. These results emphasize the critical role of small singular values, suggesting that removing them in an already aligned transformer can be detrimental, as it may compromise model alignment.

Title: Improving stabilizer approximation with quantum strategy
Authors: Fen Zuo
Abstract: We introduce a quantum strategy from nonlocal games to improve the stabilizer approximation we proposed previously. The resulting approach turns out to be a qubit-by-qubit gauging procedure for standard stabilizers, which could involve discrete or continuous gauge parameters. We take examples from many-body physics and quantum chemistry to show such a procedure leads to an improvement of the performance.

Title: Testing the RG-flow $M(3,10)+ϕ_{1,7}\to M(3,8)$ with Hamiltonian Truncation
Authors: Olivier Delouche, Joan Elias Miro, James Ingoldby
Abstract: Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) methods provide a powerful numerical approach for investigating strongly coupled QFTs. In this work, we develop HT techniques to analyse a specific Renormalization Group (RG) flow recently proposed in Refs. [1, 3]. These studies put forward Ginzburg-Landau descriptions for the conformal minimal models $M(3,10)$ and $M(3,8)$, as well as the RG flow connecting them. Specifically, the RG-flow is defined by deforming the $M(3,10)$ with the relevant primary operator $\phi_{1,7}$ (whose indices denote its position in the Kac table), yielding $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$. From the perspective of HT, realising such an RG-flow presents significant challenges, as the $\phi_{1,7}$ deformation requires renormalizing the UV theory up to third order in the coupling constant of the deformation. In this study, we carry out the necessary calculations to formulate HT for this theory and numerically investigate the spectrum of $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$ in the large coupling regime, finding strong evidence in favour of the proposed flow.

Title: Reactive path ensembles within nonequilibrium steady-states
Authors: Aditya N. Singh, David T. Limmer
Abstract: The modern theory of rare events is grounded in near equilibrium ideas, however many systems of modern interest are sufficiently far from equilibrium that traditional approaches do not apply. Using the recently developed variational path sampling methodology, we study systems evolving within nonequilibrium steady states to elucidate how reactive processes are altered away from equilibrium. Variational path sampling provides access to ensembles of reactive events, and a means of quantifying the relative importance of each dynamical degree of freedom in such processes. With it, we have studied the conformational change of a solute in an active bath. We illustrate how energy injection generically enhances the rates of rare events, even when energy is not directed into specific reactive modes. By studying the folding and unfolding transitions of a grafted polymer under shear, we illustrate how nonequilibrium reactive processes do not follow gradient paths due to the emergence of persistent currents. The breaking of detailed balance allows for the mechanisms of forward and backward reactions to be distinct, enabling novel pathways to be explored and designed, and states unstable in equilibrium to become stabilized kinetically away from it. The analysis presented in this work establishes some basic principles for nonequilibrium reactive events, and is made possible by the use of a numerical method that does not invoke proximity to equilibrium or requires strong prior assumptions about the mechanism of reaction.

Title: Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics in an Interacting Fermionic Chain
Authors: Rishabh Jha, Salvatore R. Manmana, Stefan Kehrein
Abstract: Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.
