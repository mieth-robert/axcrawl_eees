Title: MHD Macroscopic ball analysis: An Open Toolkit for Analyzing Magnetic Particle Rotation in Viscous Media
Authors: Roberts Treize
Abstract: This paper presents MHD_Macroscopic_ball_analysis, an open-source Python toolkit developed to study the rotational dynamics of magnetized spherical particles immersed in viscous media under externally applied rotating magnetic fields. The toolkit extracts the orientation of the magnetic moment from grayscale video frames using image processing and enables detailed comparisons with synchronized magnetic field vector data. We outline the motivation, core algorithms, implementation, and validation of the toolkit in the context of macroscopic experiments simulating magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) particle behavior.

Title: Topological domain-wall states from Umklapp scattering in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Juncheng Li, Cong Chen, Wang Yao
Abstract: Twistronics, harnessing interlayer rotation to tailor electronic states in van der Waals materials, has predominantly focused on small-angle regime. Here, we unveil the pivotal role of intervalley Umklapp scattering in large-angle twisted bilayer graphene, which governs low-energy physics and drives unconventional band topology. By constructing symmetry-constrained effective $k\cdot p$ models for $\pm 21.8^{\circ}$-twisted bilayers, we demonstrate how structural chirality imprints distinct electronic responses. The $D_6$ configuration exhibits a gapped spectrum with chiral interlayer coupling, while $D_3$ symmetric stacking configuration displays semimetallic behavior. Crucially, chirality inversion creates topological domain-wall states, which manifest as counterpropagating pseudospin modes at interfaces between oppositely twisted regions. These states, absent in untwisted bilayers, emerge from a Jackiw-Rebbi-like mechanism tied to chirality reversal. Atomistic simulations confirm these topological states and demonstrate their robustness against symmetry-breaking perturbations. The interplay between twist-induced chirality and topology opens new pathways for engineering domain-wall states in twisted materials.

Title: A comparative study of the high-pressure structural stability of zirconolite materials for nuclear waste immobilisation
Authors: Daniel Errandonea, Robin Turnbull, Josu Sanchez-Martin, Robert Oliva, Alfonso Munoz, Silvana Radescu, Andres Mujica, Lewis Blackburn, Neil C. Hyatt, Catalin Popescu, Jordi Ibanez-Insa
Abstract: We present a comparative study of the high-pressure behaviours of the nuclear waste immobilisation materials zirconolite-2M, -4M, -3O, and -3T. The materials are studied under high-pressure conditions using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction. For zirconolite-2M we also performed density-functional theory calculations. A new triclinic crystal structure (space group P-1), instead of the previously assigned monoclinic structure (space group C2/c) is proposed for zirconolite-2M. We named the triclinic structure as zirconolite-2TR. We also found that zirconolite-2TR undergoes a phase transition at 14.7 GPa to a monoclinic structure described by space group C2/c, which is different than the high-pressure structure previously proposed in the literature. These results are discussed in comparison with previous studies on zirconolite-2M and the related compound calzirtite. For the other three zirconolite structures (4M, 3O, and 3T) this is the first high-pressure study, and we find no evidence for pressure induced phase transitions in any of them. The linear compressibility of the studied compounds, as well as a room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state, are also presented and discussed.

Title: Quench dynamics of disordered quadrupolar Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Abdelaali Boudjemaa
Abstract: We systematically investigate the equilibrium and the nonequilibrium quench dynamics of three-dimensional disordered quadrupolar Bose-Einstein condensates. Within the Bogoliubov-Huang-Meng approximation, we show that the combined effect of quenched interactions, disorder and excitations may modify the static as well as the dynamic properties of the system. The validity criterion of the developed approach is accurately established. By quenching the interaction strength, we reveal that the quantum depletion and the deformation condensate induced by disorder are enhanced in the asymptotic steady state compared to the corresponding equilibrium values. The time evolution of the condensate deformation is accompanied by damped oscillations with amplitudes strongly depend on the disorder correlation length and on the relative quadrupolar interaction.

Title: Absence of dissipation-free topological edge states in quadratic open fermions
Authors: Liang Mao
Abstract: We prove a no-go theorem that generic quadratic open fermionic systems, governed by Lindblad master equations, cannot host dissipation-free topological edge states. Drawing an analogy to topological insulators and superconductors, we map the Lindbladian to a first-quantized matrix representation that encodes the band structure, whose zero-energy topological edge modes are exactly dissipation-free. This matrix, however, is always adiabatically connected to a topologically trivial matrix, even under symmetry constraints. We formulate s rigorous adiabatic path to demonstrate this property. Thus, there is no robust dissipation-free edge modes protected by the bulk topology in quadratic open fermions, under any unitary or anti-unitary symmetries. Our result applies to generic quadratic fermionic Lindbladians, requiring only gapped bulk and bounded spectrum for technical convenience. Our result establish a definitive boundary for the existence of robust topological phenomena in open fermionic systems.

Title: Effects of symmetry on coupled rotary molecular motors
Authors: Sara Iranbakhsh, David A. Sivak
Abstract: As engineering advances toward the nanoscale, understanding design principles for molecular motors becomes increasingly valuable. Many molecular motors consist of coupled components transducing one free-energy source into another. Here, we study the performance of coupled rotary molecular motors with different rotational symmetries under constant and scaling driving forces. Under constant driving and strong coupling, symmetry match between the motors decreases the output power. In contrast, under a scaling driving force, the output power is not sensitive to symmetries. However, driving the upstream motor too strongly reduces the downstream motor's output power, leading to a perhaps counterintuitive phenomenon we term disruption, in which the two motors become disconnected. Across both driving schemes, output power peaks at intermediate coupling, confirming the value of flexible coupling. Beyond providing insights into biological motors, these findings could inform the future design of synthetic nanomotors and structure-based drugs.

Title: Microwave characterization of superconducting coplanar resonators made out of granular aluminium
Authors: Kelvin J. Ramos, Ivana Curci, Erick Potosí, Ignacio Lobato, Leonardo Salazar Alarcón, Hernán Pastoriza, Leandro Tosi
Abstract: We have designed, fabricated and characterized microwave resonators made out of thin films of granular aluminium (grAl) with different oxygen content. We extract the contribution of the large kinetic-inductance of this disordered superconductor from the frequency shift of the resonators as a function of temperature, and discuss the correlation with the resistivity of the films. At low temperatures, measurements of the internal quality factor as a function of microwave power indicate the presence of two-level systems, which are inherent to the growth process of the granular aluminium. The characterization methods presented here may be useful for the design of MKIDs, high-impedance resonators and superinductors.

Title: Orientational Disorder of NH$_3$ in Hexammine Magnesium Borohydride
Authors: Liam A. V. Nagle-Cocco, Andreas Schneemann, Kevin H. Stone, Vitalie Stavila, Thomas Gennett, Nicholas A. Strange
Abstract: Hexammine magnesium borohydride, Mg(NH$_3$)$_6$(BH$_4$)$_2$, consists of adducted NH$_3$ molecules locked in a matrix of Mg cations and borohydride anions. It is a candidate material for hydrogen storage, with 16.8wt\% hydrogen stored in both the NH$_3$ and borohydride anions. It also may be of interest as a Mg$^{2+}$ conducting electrolyte in solid state batteries. Its crystal structure has, until now, eluded a proper structural solution due to ambiguity regarding the NH$_3$ position and behaviour. In this work, we show using synchrotron X-ray diffraction that the room-temperature structure can be solved only with a model assuming orientational disorder of ammonia molecules within the crystal structure. Cooling the sample to 120\,K yields additional Bragg peaks, which can only be solved with a unit cell expansion consistent with a freezing of the orientational freedom of ammonia molecules. Using this insight from the structure solution, we perform a full assignment of the vibrational modes in the room-temperature IR spectrum.

Title: The role of orbital polarization and spin-dependent electron-phonon scatterings in chiral-induced spin selectivity
Authors: Mayank Gupta, Andrew Grieder, Mayada Fadel, Jacopo Simoni, Junting Yu, Ravishankar Sundararaman, Yuan Ping
Abstract: Chiral materials exhibit unique spin and charge transport properties, notably through the chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, enabling spin-polarized currents in nonmagnetic materials without external magnetic fields at room temperature. In this study, we investigate the microscopic mechanisms underlying CISS in a prototypical chiral solid, trigonal selenium (Se), based on a first principles spatial-temporal resolved density-matrix dynamics approach, including electron-phonon scattering with self-consistent spin-orbit couplings (SOC). Our approach elucidates the interplay of SOC, structural chirality, and spin-dependent electron-phonon interactions in driving the generation and transport of spin and orbital angular momentum. We demonstrate that charge transport along the chiral axis induces significant chirality-dependent spin and orbital polarization, which shows a monotonic increase with higher chirality. Meanwhile, we show the orbital polarization generated in CISS has a weak dependence on SOC, unlike spin. Most importantly, we reveal the key difference between the CISS and colinear Edelstein effect (CEE) originating from spin-dependent electron-phonon scatterings, which explains the spin polarization increase with device lengths, a unique feature in CISS.

Title: Longitudinal magnons in large-$S$ easy-axis magnets
Authors: A. El Mendili, T. Ziman, M. E. Zhitomirsky
Abstract: Longitudinal magnons are a novel class of multipolar quantum excitations in magnetic materials with large spins $S\ge 1$ and strong easy-axis anisotropy. These excitations have angular momentum $S^z = \pm 2S$ and can be viewed as propagating spin reversals. We study a simple model for longitudinal magnons: a square lattice of spins $S$ coupled by the neareast-neighbor exchange, ferro- or antiferromagnetic, in the presence of a single-ion anisotropy. We calculate the excitation spectra in the large-$D$ limit by using a strong-coupling expansion. In the specific case of $S=1$ we compare the results for several analytical approaches that include the linked-cluster expansion, the multiboson representation of spin operators, and also, for a ferromagnetic ground state, the exact solution of the two-particle bound states. Among these different approaches, the multiboson theory gives the decay rate of longitudinal magnons and describes the evolution of the excitation spectra from strong to moderate and weak anisotropy.

Title: Composite Fermion Theory of Fractional Chern Insulator Stability
Authors: Xiaodong Hu, Ying Ran, Di Xiao
Abstract: We develop a mean-field theory of the stability of fractional Chern insulators based on the dipole picture of composite fermions (CFs). We construct CFs by binding vortices to Bloch electrons and derive a CF single-particle Hamiltonian that describes a Hofstadter problem in the enlarged CF Hilbert space, with the well-known trace condition emerging naturally in the small-$q$ limit. Applied to twisted MoTe$_2$, the calculated CF phase diagram matches closely with that from exact diagonalization, and the projected many-body wavefunctions achieve exceptionally high overlaps with the latter. Our theory provides both a microscopic understanding and a computationally efficient tool for identifying fractional Chern insulators.

Title: Hybrid metal-semiconductor quantum dots in InAs as a platform for quantum simulation
Authors: Praveen Sriram, Connie L. Hsueh, Karna A. Morey, Tiantian Wang, Candice Thomas, Geoffrey C. Gardner, Marc A. Kastner, Michael J. Manfra, David Goldhaber-Gordon
Abstract: Arrays of hybrid metal-semiconductor islands offer a new approach to quantum simulation, with key advantages over arrays of conventional quantum dots. Because the metallic component of these hybrid islands has a quasi-continuous level spectrum, each site in an array can be effectively electronically identical; in contrast, each conventional semiconductor quantum dot has its own spectral fingerprint. Meanwhile, the semiconductor component retains gate-tunability of intersite coupling. This combination creates a scalable platform for simulating correlated ground states driven by Coulomb interactions. We report the fabrication and characterization of hybrid metal-semiconductor islands, featuring a submicron metallic component transparently contacting a gate-confined region of an InAs quantum well with tunable couplings to macroscopic leads. Tuning to the weak-coupling limit forms a single-electron transistor with highly-uniform Coulomb peaks, with no resolvable excitation spectrum in the Coulomb diamonds. Upon increasing the transmissions toward the ballistic regime we observe an evolution to dynamical Coulomb blockade.

Title: Angle-resolved photoemission intensity for multi-orbital bands: Complex interplay between the self-energy matrix and the optical matrix elements
Authors: Yau Chuen Yam, Mona Berciu, George A. Sawayzky
Abstract: We use a simple one-dimensional two-band model with electron-phonon coupling to illustrate some of the complications that arise in multi-band systems when trying to extract a self-energy using the typical approach used for single-band systems when analyzing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data. The underlying reason is that in multi-band models the self-energy is a matrix, not a scalar, and the result obtained from the ARPES analysis is a complicated function of all these self-energy matrix elements, weighted by different dipole matrix elements of the relevant Wannier orbitals. We contrast the results for Holstein and Peierls electron-phonon couplings to further illustrate differences between models with a local versus non-local self-energy matrix.

Title: Transmon qubit using Sn as a junction superconductor

Abstract: Superconductor qubits typically use aluminum-aluminum oxide tunnel junctions to provide the non-linear inductance. Junctions with semiconductor barriers make it possible to vary the superconductor material and explore beyond aluminum. We use InAs semiconductor nanowires coated with thin superconducting shells of beta-Sn to realize transmon qubits. By tuning the Josephson energy with a gate voltage, we adjust the qubit frequency over a range of 3 GHz. The longest energy relaxation time, T1 = 27 microseconds, is obtained at the lowest qubit frequencies, while the longest echo dephasing time, T2 = 1.8 microseconds, is achieved at higher frequencies. We assess the possible factors limiting coherence times in these devices and discuss steps to enhance performance through improvements in materials fabrication and circuit design.

Title: EAC-Net: Real-space charge density via equivariant atomic contributions
Authors: Qin Xuejian, Lv Taoyuze, Zhong Zhicheng
Abstract: Charge density is a fundamental quantity in quantum simulations, yet its accurate computation remains a major bottleneck. We present the Equivariant Atomic Contribution Network (EAC-Net), a deep learning framework for efficient and accurate charge density prediction. By introducing an atom-grid coupling mechanism, EAC-Net integrates the strengths of grid-based and basis-function-based models, achieving simultaneous improvements in accuracy and efficiency. We evaluated EAC-Net on a wide variety of systems, including amorphous solids, molecular liquids, surface structures, and metallic alloys, and found that it consistently achieves high accuracy with prediction errors typically below 1%. We further develop EAC-mp by training on Material Project's CHGCAR datasets, which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy comparable to existing large charge density models while providing atomic-decomposed charge densities. The model demonstrates strong zero-shot prediction capabilities across diverse material systems. Moreover, EAC-Net generalizes well beyond the training distribution, supporting downstream applications such as non-self-consistent band structure calculations under structural perturbations. By bridging local chemical environments and global charge distributions, EAC-Net provides a scalable and general framework for accelerating electronic structure prediction, with potential applications in high-throughput materials screening and machine-learning-driven simulation workflows.

Title: Competing Magnetic Phases in Li-Fe-Ge Kagome Systems
Authors: Zhen Zhang, Kirill D. Belashchenko, Xiaoyi Su, Atreyee Das, Sergey L. Bud'ko, Paul C. Canfield, Vladimir Antropov
Abstract: Competing interlayer magnetic interactions in kagome magnets can lead to diverse magnetic phases, which enable various promising topological or quantum material properties. Here, the electronic structure and magnetic properties have been studied using first-principles calculations for the LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$, LiFe$_6$Ge$_4$, and LiFe$_6$Ge$_5$ compounds sharing the kagome Fe$_3$Ge layer motif but with different interlayer arrangements. For LiFe$_6$Ge$_4$ and LiFe$_6$Ge$_5$, the predicted magnetic ground states are collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) states involving a mix of ferromagnetic (FM) and AFM interlayer orientations. Whereas for LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$, an incommensurate cycloidal spin spiral is stabilized as a ground state, being close to a collinear A-type AFM state. The analysis of magnetic RKKY exchange coupling confirms the results of electronic structure calculations. The values of atomic magnetic moments are in good agreement with existing experimental estimations. Our experiments on LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$ single crystals have observed AFM ordering at ~540 K and spin-reorientation transition with a small FM component (possibly with spin canting) below ~270 K. Thus, both theory and experiment independently suggest the existence and sequence of non-collinear and collinear magnetic states in kagome LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$. Our findings provide a platform for exploring various novel magnetic phases and associated unconventional or topological magnetism.

Title: Accelerating Discovery of Ternary Chiral Materials via Large-Scale Random Crystal Structure Prediction
Authors: Jiexi Song, Diwei Shi, Fengyuan Xuan, Chongde Cao
Abstract: Chiral inorganic crystals with topological characteristics, prized for their exotic properties and fundamental interest, remain scarce in existing database. This work establishes a viable route for their large-scale discovery by integrating universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) for high-throughput structure optimization with the broad exploration capability of Random Structure Search (RSS). We implemented this combined uMLIP-RSS workflow to perform massive variable-composition crystal structure prediction across ternary systems, specifically targeting chiral space groups. High-throughput uMLIP-based optimization and stability screening of over 20 million randomly generated chiral structures identified numerous potentially stable phases out of existing database. Subsequent validation by first-principles confirmed over 120 new chiral inorganic crystals with promising functional applications, including topological characteristics, nonlinear optics, and superconductivity. Notably, this set includes materials exhibiting remarkable quantum phenomena, such as the nonlinear Hall effect driven by berry curvature dipole, quantum metric and symmetry-enforced six-fold topological points, long Fermi arcs and large magnetoresistance. This work substantially expands the pool of chiral functional materials and demonstrates a scalable, efficient strategy for predictive discovery in complex materials.

Title: Dynamical generation of geometric squeezing in interacting Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Li Chen, Fei Zhu, Zheng Tang, Liang Zeng, Jae Joon Lee, Han Pu
Abstract: When the rotating frequency of a non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) confined in a weak anisotropic harmonic potential is suddenly quenched to its trapping frequency, the condensate evolves from its ground state to a single-mode squeezed state with exponentially growing quantum fluctuation anisotropy. Such a squeezed state is called the geometrically squeezed state. However, for interacting BECs with two-body collisions, a similar quench only results in quantum fluctuations oscillating periodically without squeezing. In this work, we identify superfluid stability as the key factor behind this non-squeezing phenomenon, with the periodic oscillations arising from collective excitations of a stable collective excitation mode. By strategically breaking the stability criteria, we propose a dynamical approach for generating squeezing that can exponentially suppress quantum fluctuations in a relatively short time, surpassing the efficiency of existing experimental preparation schemes.

Title: Chern-Simons type cross-correlations and geometric Born effective charge of phonons
Authors: Swati Chaudhary, Takashi Oka
Abstract: The interplay between different degrees of freedom in condensed matter systems engenders a rich variety of emergent phenomena. In particular, fermions with non-trivial quantum geometry can generate Chern-Simons (CS)-like terms in effective field theories for different gauge fields. For phonons, such terms can result in chiral phonon splitting. Here, we propose that the local Berry curvature can influence the spectra and dynamics of optical phonons, even in materials with zero Chern number, which we demonstrate with a gapped Dirac model. We identify a previously overlooked CS like cross-correlation between electromagnetic and pseudo-gauge fields in 2+1 dimensions which depends on valley Chern number. It facilitates a direct coupling between phonons and photons by inducing a geometric Born effective charge. This opens up a new route for coherent Raman phonon excitation and quantum geometry probes.

Title: Four-mode quantum sensing and Fisher information in a spin-orbit-coupled Bose gas
Authors: Fei Zhu, Zheng Tang, Liang Zeng, Shu Wang, Li Chen
Abstract: Multi-mode squeezing and entanglement are important resources in quantum metrology and sensing. For spin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensates subject to spin-orbit coupling (SOC), previous studies on spin squeezing have been limited to two-mode systems. In this work, we demonstrate that such a system can naturally construct a four-mode model spanning an $\mathfrak{su}(4)$ algebra with six SU(2) subspaces. Using spin squeezing parameters and quantum Fisher information matrices, we analyze the dynamical evolution of coherent spin states. The results show that, beyond two-mode models, the SOC-induced four-mode couplings give rise to richer entanglement-enhanced sensing approaching the Heisenberg limit across various SU(2) subspaces. Additionally, by tuning a single system parameter (the Raman Rabi frequency), one can selectively control the optimal measurement directions across different subspaces.

Title: Straightforward Method to Orient Black Phosphorus from Bulk to Thin Layers using a Standard Green Laser
Authors: Etienne Carré, Frédéric Fossard, Jean-Sébastien Mérot, Denis Boivin, Nicolas Horezan, Victor Zatko, Florian Godel, Bruno Dlubak, Marie-Blandine Martin, Pierre Seneor, Etienne Gaufres, Julien Barjon, Annick Loiseau, Ingrid Stenger
Abstract: The crystallographic orientation of anisotropic 2D materials plays a crucial role in their physical properties and device performance. However, standard orientation techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or X-ray diffraction (XRD) can be complex and less accessible for routine characterization. In this study, we investigate the orientation of black phosphorus (BP) from bulk crystals to thin layers using angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy (ARPRS) with a single-wavelength (514 nm) Raman setup. By incorporating thickness-dependent interference effects and anisotropic optical indices, this approach provides a reliable framework for orientation determination across different BP thicknesses. The method is validated through direct orientation measurements using TEM and Electron Backscattering Diffraction (EBSD), confirming its applicability to both thick and ultrathin samples. Given its simplicity and compatibility with widely available Raman setups, this approach offers a practical solution for characterizing BP orientation without requiring advanced structural characterization techniques.

Title: Non-Equilibrium Dynamics and First-Passage Properties of Stochastic Processes: From Brownian Motion to Active Particles
Authors: Mathis Guéneau
Abstract: In this thesis, we develop analytical methods to study out-of-equilibrium stochastic processes driven by colored noise, i.e., noise with temporal correlations. These non-Markovian processes pose significant analytical challenges compared to processes driven by white noise, such as Brownian motion. A primary focus is on active particle systems, specifically the run-and-tumble particle subjected to an arbitrary force. We derive exact expressions for its mean first-passage time (MFPT) and exit probability from an interval using the backward Fokker-Planck equation. Remarkably, we find that the MFPT can be optimized as a function of the tumbling rate. Additionally, we investigate stochastic resetting and switching diffusion models. For switching diffusion models which are examples of "Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusions", we use a renewal approach and large deviation theory to derive exact results for various observables. These include the distribution of the position of the particle and its moments, but also its cumulants which are key observables to characterize non-Gaussian fluctuations. Notably, we uncover an unexpected connection between this model and free cumulants. We also examine these models in the presence of a harmonic potential by using Kesten variables. This approach enables us to write an integral equation for the steady-state distribution, which we solve in specific cases. Furthermore, we extend Siegmund duality - a concept that is not widely known in the physics literature - to active particles, random diffusion models, stochastic resetting, and continuous-time random walks. This duality establishes a direct relation between first passage observables and the spatial properties of a dual process, which we explicitly construct.

Title: Effect of screening on Seebeck coefficient in bilayer graphene/AlGaAs electron gas
Authors: Vo Van Tai, Nguyen Duy Vy, Truong Van Tuan, Nguyen Quoc Khanh
Abstract: The knowledge of Seebeck coefficient is a key factor in optimization of thermoelectric materials and finding right applications for it. A high sensitivity to structural change makes thermopower measurements an excellent technique for the study on the charge transport properties of a given material. The phonondrag term dominates at low temperature in the Seebeck coefficient This study examines the temperaturedependent screening effect on the phonondraginduced Seebeck coefficient S^g in a bilayer graphene- BLG-AlGaAs-quasi-twodimensional electron gas (q2DEG) system at the temperature below 50 K. The BLG layer interacts with both deformation potential acoustic phonons and stronger piezoelectric field acoustic phonons from AlGaAs/GaAs. We compare the electronphonon interactions in BLG with and without screening by q2DEG. The screening effect reduces particularly at low temperatures and shows a strong dependence on the carrier density in the BLG layer. The doublelayer screening function increases with layer separation d paralleling the monolayer screening at large d. Additionally varying the GaAs quantum well width reveals that increases with width less than 100 Åunder doublelayer screening but remains unchanged beyond this threshold while monolayer screening decreases as the width increases. Both screening functions enhance when the BLG carrier density is lower than that of q2DEG though the magnitude difference between them is minimal

Title: $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector precession induced pumping in topological $p$-wave superconductors
Authors: Jun-Jie Fu, Jin An
Abstract: Time-reversal invariant $p$-wave superconductors (SCs) are characterized by their $\boldsymbol{d}$-vectors, whose orientations could be manipulated by a tiny magnetic field. We study in this paper the adiabatic pumping process induced by periodically rotating $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector in a topological $p$-wave SC, which is coupled to two normal leads. If $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector rotates nearly within a plane, the pumped spin $2S_z/\hbar$ over one cycle is nearly quantized at $2$ without net charge pumping. When the pumping lead is fully spin-polarized, both the pumped charge $Q/e$ and spin $2S_z/\hbar$ would peak nearly at $1$. When a mixing $s$-wave pairing component is taken into account, a topological phase transition can be driven by modulating the ratio between the pairing components. We found a sharp resonance phenomenon near the phase transition when the $p$-wave $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector is adiabatically rotating, which may help experimentally distinguish the topological SCs from trivial ones.

Title: Symmetric versus antisymmetric strain tuning of the valence transition in Yb(In$_{1-x}$Ag$_x$)Cu$_4$
Authors: Caitlin I. O'Neil, Michelle Ocker, Kristin Kliemt, Cornelius Krellner, Elena Gati
Abstract: Similar to transitions in a range of correlated quantum materials, the valence transition exhibits a strong coupling to the crystal lattice, rendering it highly sensitive to stress tuning. In the present work, we determine the effect of uniaxial stress, which breaks the lattice symmetry, on the valence transition temperature and its crossover temperature in pure and Ag-substituted YbInCu$_4$. Our key result is that hydrostatic stress is more effective in tuning this transition than uniaxial stress. Based on a symmetry decomposition of the stress-induced strains, we argue that this observation can be quantitatively understood, given that the valence transition is mostly sensitive to symmetric strains and thus volume changes of the lattice. These results support the notion that the valence transition can give rise to critical elasticity close to its critical endpoint.

Title: Cooperative Jahn-Teller dynamics of boron clusters in the infrared conductivity of heavy fermion metal CeB6 and unconventional superconductor ZrB12
Authors: Gennady Komandin, Elena Zhukova, Boris Gorshunov, Andrey Azarevich, Andrey Muratov, Yurii Aleshchenko, Nikolay Sluchanko
Abstract: A thorough study of the wide-range (40-35000 cm-1) dynamic conductivity and permittivity spectra of the archetypal heavy fermion metal CeB6 and unconventional superconductor ZrB12 was carried out at room temperature. Both the Drude-type components and overdamped excitations were separated and analyzed. An additional absorption band observed above 200 cm-1 was attributed to the cooperative Jahn-Teller dynamics of the boron complexes in CeB6 and ZrB12. It was shown that nonequilibrium electrons participating in the formation of the collective JT modes dominate in charge transport, and fraction of Drude-type electrons does not exceed 37% in CeB6 and 23% in ZrB12. We discuss also the additional Drude-type component in ZrB12 in terms of far-infrared conductivity from the sliding charge density wave, and suggest the localized mode scenario reconciles the strong difference between the number of conduction electrons obtained from the Hall effect and optical sum rule analysis in CeB6.

Title: Suspensions of small ultra-soft colloids remain liquids in overcrowded conditions
Authors: Nikolaos A. Burger, Alexander V. Petrunin, Ann E. Terry Ralf Schweins, Andrea Scotti
Abstract: Concentrated suspensions of small ultra-soft colloids (ultra-low crosslinked microgels) are investigated with scattering and steady shear rheology to capture their equilibrium dynamics. The suspensions lack dynamic arrest, although the slow relaxation time $\tau_2$ follows exponential growth with increasing generalized packing fraction, $\zeta$. The zero-shear viscosity grows weakly with $\zeta$, and never diverges in contrast to other soft glass formers, e.g.~star-polymers, microgels, green particles. Their high compressibility allows these ultra-soft spheres to diffuse even in overcrowded environments.

Title: Thermoresponsive copolymer microgels synthesized via single-step precipitation polymerization: random or block structure?
Authors: Letizia Tavagnacco, Elena Buratti, Jacopo Vialetto, Francesco Brasili, Elisa Ballin, Kuno Schwärzer, Jitendra Mata, Graziano Di Carmine, Monica Bertoldo, Ester Chiessi, Marco Laurati, Emanuela Zaccarelli
Abstract: The inner structure of polymeric particles critically influences their phase behavior and functionality, governing their mechanical properties and their physical and chemical interactions. For thermoresponsive microgels, i.e. colloidal particles comprising a crosslinked polymer network that undergo a volume transition upon temperature changes, structural control is key to tailor the material responsivity and broaden the range of applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation of the internal structure of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-N-isopropylmethacrylamide), P(NIPAM-co-NIPMAM), copolymer microgels, combining small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements with multi-scale simulations. By synthesizing different samples, we probe the microgels swelling behavior, revealing distinct signatures of the individual polymers. To elucidate their internal distribution, we perform monomer-resolved microgel simulations across different copolymer models. A direct comparison between experimental and numerical form factors under different, neutron-selective conditions provides evidence of a preferential organization into block structures rather than a random arrangement. These results are confirmed by 13C-NMR which reveals the clear presence of NIPAM blocks within a more random arrangement of the remaining monomers and by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on copolymer chains, which also shed light on a possible origin in the dependence of the hydrogen bonding capability on the local environment. These findings provide a detailed microscopic picture of the inner architecture of P(NIPAM-co-NIPMAM) microgels, revealing an unexpected structural organization that may be generalized to other copolymer systems and could be promising to tailor microgel design and enhance control of material responsivity.

Title: Open Gas-Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy at 50 pm Resolution

Abstract: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has reached ~ 50 picometer resolution in a high vacuum, enabling single-atom sensitive imaging of nanomaterials. Extending this capability to gaseous environments would allow for similar visualizations of nanomaterial dynamics under chemically reactive conditions. Here, we examine a new TEM system that maintains 50 pm resolution at pressures up to 1 mbar, demonstrated using nanocrystalline Au immersed in N2. The system features an open gas-cell with a four-stage differential pumping system, a 5th order aberration corrector for broad-beam TEM, a monochromatized electron beam, an ultra-stable microscope platform, Nelsonian low electron dose-rate illumination, and direct electron detection. Young fringe experiments and exit wave phase imaging confirm the atomic resolution and indicate location-dependent vibrational blur at surface terminations. Thus, this platform advances in situ and operando TEM studies of gas-surface interactions in diverse fields, including catalysis, corrosion, and crystal growth.

Abstract: A two-dimensional system consisting a mixture of higly coarse-grained saturated (S-type), unsaturated (U-type) lipid molecules, and cholesterol (C-type) molecules is considered to form a model lipid monolayer. All the S-, U- and C-type particles are spherical in shape, with distinct interaction strengths. The phase behavior of the system is studied for various compositions ($x$) of the C-type particles, ranging from $x = 0.1$ to $0.9$. The results show that a structurally ordered complex is formed with the S- and C-types in the fluid-like environment of U-type particles, for $x \in \lbrace 0.5 - 0.6\rbrace$. The time-averaged hexatic order parameter $\left\langle \Psi_{6} \right\rangle$ indicates that the dynamical segregation of S- and C-types exhibits a positional order, that is found to be maximum for $x$ in the range of 0.5 - 0.6. The mean change in the free energy ($\Delta G(x)$) obtained from the mean change in enthalpy ($\Delta H$) and entropy ($\Delta S$) calculations suggests that $\Delta G$ is minimum for $x \sim 0.6$. A phenomenological expression for the Gibbs free energy is formulated by explicitly accounting for the individual free energies of S-,U- and C-type particles and the mutual interactions between them. Minimizing this phenomenological $G$ with respect to the C-type composition results in the optimal value, $x^* = 0.564 \pm 0.001$ for stable coexistence of phases; consistent with the simulation results and also the previous experimental observations \cite{raghavendra_effect_2023}. All these observations signifies the optimal C-type composition, $x \sim 0.5 - 0.6$.

Title: Is the cortical dynamics ergodic? A numerical study in partially symmetric networks of spiking neurons
Authors: Ferdinand Tixidre, Gianluigi Mongillo, Alessandro Torcini
Abstract: Cortical activity in-vivo displays relaxational time scales much longer than the membrane time constant of the neurons or the deactivation time of ionotropic synaptic conductances. The mechanisms responsible for such slow dynamics are not understood. Here, we show that slow dynamics naturally and robustly emerges in dynamically-balanced networks of spiking neurons. This requires only partial symmetry in the synaptic connectivity, a feature of local cortical networks observed in experiments. The symmetry generates an effective, excitatory self-coupling of the neurons that leads to long-lived fluctuations in the network activity, without destroying the dynamical balance. When the excitatory self-coupling is suitably strong, the same mechanism leads to multiple equilibrium states of the network dynamics. Our results reveal a novel dynamical regime of the collective activity in spiking networks, where the memory of the initial state persists for very long times and ergodicity is broken.

Title: Ultrafast Raman probe of the photoinduced superconducting to normal state transition in the cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$
Authors: Laurène Gatuingt, Alexandr Alekhin, Niloufar Nilforoushan, Sarah Houver, Alain Sacuto, Genda Gu, Yann Gallais
Abstract: We report an ultrafast Time-Resolved Raman scattering study of the out-of-equilibrium photoinduced dynamics across the superconducting to normal state phase transition of the cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. Using the polarization-resolved momentum space selectivity of Raman scattering, we track the superconducting condensate destruction and recovery with sub-ps resolution in the anti-nodal region of the Fermi surface where the superconducting gap is maximum. Leveraging ultrafast Raman thermometry, we find a significant dichotomy between the superconducting condensate and the quasiparticle temperature dynamics near the anti-nodes, which cannot be framed in terms of a single effective electron temperature. The present work demonstrates the ability of TR-Raman to selectively probe out-of-equilibrium pathways of different electron sub-degrees of freedom during a photoinduced phase transition.

Title: Theory of circular dichroism in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
Authors: M. Furo, A. Hariki, J. Kuneš
Abstract: We analyze circular dichroism (CD) in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in magnetic materials. We define RIXS-CD as the difference between scattering amplitudes for the right- and left-circularly polarized incoming photons and unpolarized (total) outgoing photons. We employ the impurity approximation, in which the interference between scattering events on different atoms is neglected. We perform the symmetry analysis of several common antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic structures and outline the general approach. The analysis is supported by numerical calculations using atomic model with realistic crystal fields obtained from first principles. We show that RIXS-CD is distinguished from first-order spectroscopies such as x-ray magnetic circular dichroism by insensitivity to the time-reversal symmetry breaking. As a result we find that RIXS-CD is present in the normal (disordered) state of materials with lower symmetry. In antiferromagnets the RIXS-CD is invariant under Néel vector reversal. In altermagnets and ferromagnets the RIXS-CD spectra for time-reversed states are, in general, independent except for the special case when there is a unitary symmetry of the Hamiltonian connecting the

Title: Anomalous Doppler effect in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Tomasz Zawiślak, Sandro Stringari, Alessio Recati
Abstract: We show that two-component Bose-Einstein condensed mixtures, in presence of a persistent current, exhibit a non trivial Doppler shift of the sound velocities. The peculiarity is due to the inter-species interaction and the possibility of generating a counter-flow persistent current. Analytic predictions are derived by using superfluid hydrodynamics. While the existence of anomalous Doppler shifts at finite temperature has been discussed a long time ago in the case of superfluid Helium-4, an experimental verification of the effect is still missing. For this reason, we also propose a protocol for the measurement of the Doppler shifts, based on the density-density response function. The dynamical protocol is simulated by means of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations.

Title: Hydrodynamics of a three-dimensional mesoscale odd fluid
Authors: Yuxing Jiao, Mingcheng Yang
Abstract: Odd fluids are a class of fluids characterized by non-zero antisymmetric transport coefficient tensors induced by broken time-reversal symmetry. In our previous work, a mesoscale simulation model for two-dimensional isotropic odd fluids was developed. Here, we extend the model to the three-dimensional case that corresponds to an anisotropic odd fluid with cylindrical symmetry. Using kinetic theory, we analytically derive the viscosity tensor and Navier-Stokes equation for the three-dimensional mesoscale odd fluid, which are quantitatively verified by simulations. Furthermore, through both simulation and hydrodynamic theory, we demonstrate that the planar Poiseuille flow of the three-dimensional odd fluid exhibits exotic transport behavior. This work thus paves the way for performing large-scale simulations to explore and exploit intriguing phenomena of odd fluids.

Title: Active Extensile Hydrogels Actuated by Living Polymers of the Bacterial Cytokinetic Protein FtsZ
Authors: Mikheil Kharbedia, Diego Herráez-Aguilar, Macarena Calero, Horacio López-Menéndez, Clara Luque-Rioja, Lara H. Moleiro, Cruz Santos, Pilar Lillo, Francisco Monroy
Abstract: Active materials capable of autonomously modulating their mechanical properties are foundational to the development of next-generation soft technologies. Here, we introduce a novel class of extensible biohybrid hydrogels powered by living polymers of the bacterial cytokinetic protein FtsZ. When embedded within a polyacrylamide (PA) matrix, GTP-fueled FtsZ filaments self-organize into treadmilling structures that generate internal extensible stresses, driving reversible softening, swelling, and fluidization of the composite FtsZ-PA hydrogel network. Unlike conventional contractile biopolymer systems, these hybrid gels exhibit stress-induced softening, yield under minimal deformation, and suppress thermal flow barriers-hallmarks of dissipative, extensile metamaterials. Microscopic particle tracking reveals active non-Gaussian fluctuations, while bulk rheology confirms programmable, concentration-dependent reductions in both stiffness and viscosity. Theoretical modeling shows that internal filament activity gives rise to a negative mechanical permittivity, establishing a new paradigm in materials science in which embedded FtsZ living polymers dynamically program active matter mechanics from within. These findings open new avenues for the design of modular, reconfigurable systems in adaptive biomaterials, soft robotics, and synthetic active matter.

Title: Nematic chiral Superconductivity driven by chiral loop current order in kagome metals
Authors: Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Hiroshi Kontani
Abstract: The sequence of unconventional quantum phases in the kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K), including charge-density-wave and loop-current order, gives rise to exotic chiral electronic states that lack time-reversal symmetry (TRS). These unusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal transport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent experiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the superconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to external magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore, a small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study, we propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the presence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel pairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC state, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS breaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably, chiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and the Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the Fermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral superconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to conventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities. Furthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave component, consistent with experimental observations. The present study provides insights into the fundamental nature of exotic SC states arising from the loop-current phase in kagome metals.

Title: Emergence of run-and-tumble-like swimming in self-propelling artificial swimmers in soft microchannels
Authors: Smita S. Sontakke, Aneesha Kajampady, Mohd Suhail Rizvi, Ranabir Dey
Abstract: Biological microswimmers often encounter deformable boundaries in physiological conditions; for instance, the viscoelastic walls of reproductive tract during migration of spermatozoa, or host tissue during early bacterial biofilm formation. However, the combined influence of elastic and hydrodynamic cues on microswimmer dynamics is poorly understood. Here, we experimentally investigate how the softness of microchannel walls affects the swimming characteristics of self-propelling microswimmers, using autophoretic active droplets as a model system. Remarkably, in a soft microchannel, a self-propelling droplet exhibits a run-and-tumble-like motility characterized by abrupt reorientations in the swimming direction, which are accompanied by local reduction and subsequent increase in the swimming speed. Such emergent swimming dynamics in response to increasing softness of microchannels have been previously unobserved for synthetic microswimmers. Using 3D boundary integral simulations and fluorescence microscopy experiments, we show that the coupling between the elastohydrodynamic interactions and the chemo-hydrodynamics, inherent in the self-propulsion mechanism, in a soft narrow confinement results in alterations in the swimming characteristics. We envisage that such adaptation of autophoretic microswimmers to changes in the softness of microchannel walls will pave the way for novel methods for tuning active agents in complex environment solely by exploiting the elasticity of confining walls.

Title: Inelastic electron tunneling through adatoms and molecular nanomagnets
Authors: Daria Kyvala, Jindrich Kolorenc
Abstract: We discuss a theoretical description of the inelastic electron tunneling spectra (IETS) of a magnetic nanosystem (an atom or a molecule) adsorbed on a solid surface measured in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). We represent the nanosystem by means of a cluster Hubbard model, which allows us to study scenarios when the tunneling electrons sequentially interact with several magnetic centers inside the nanosystem or when the magnetic centers are made out of heavy atoms with a strong spin-orbit coupling and large orbital moments. The sequential tunneling through multiple centers is illustrated on an adatom probed by an STM tip with a nickelocene molecule attached to it. For atoms with a large orbital moment, we find the transitions accessible by IETS to be governed by the selection rule $\Delta J_z\leq 2\ell+1$, where $J_z$ is the projection of the total angular momentum of the atom to the quantization axis and $\ell$ is the orbital momentum quantum number of the partially filled atomic shell carrying the magnetic moment. For atoms with magnetic moments dominated by spin, the spectra are naturally dominated by transitions fulfilling the traditional selection rule $\Delta J_z\leq 1$.

Title: Reentrant topology and reverse pumping in a quasiperiodic flux ladder
Authors: Sanchayan Banerjee, Rajashri Parida, Tapan Mishra
Abstract: Topological phases of matter are known to be unstable against strong onsite disorder in one dimension. In this work, however, we propose that in the case of a topological ladder, an onsite quasiperiodic disorder under proper conditions, first destroys the initial topological phase and subsequently, induces another topological phase through a gap-closing point. Remarkably, by allowing a staggered flux piercing through the plaquettes of the ladder, the gapless point bifurcates into two gapless critical lines, resulting in a trivial gapped phase sandwiched between the two topological phases. This results in a scenario where the system first undergoes a transition from one topological phase to a trivial phase and then to the other topological phase as a function of the quasiperiodic disorder strength. Such disorder induced re-entrant topological phase transition reveals a phenomenon of direction reversal in the topological transport, which we identify through Thouless charge pumping.

Title: Edge modes of topological Mott insulators and deconfined quantum critical points
Authors: Yuhai Liu, Toshihiro Sato, Disha Hou, Zhenjiu Wang, Wenan Guo, Fakher F. Assaad
Abstract: Topology and anomalies lead to edge modes that can interact with critical bulk fluctuations. To study this setup, pertaining to boundary criticality, we consider a model exhibiting a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a dynamically generated quantum spin Hall state (i.e.a topological Mott insulator) and an s-wave superconductor. For the topological Mott insulator, the bulk Goldstone modes are shown to be irrelevant at the helical Luttinger liquid fixed points. The deconfined quantum critical point is an instance of an emergent anomaly, and we observe a sharp localized edge state at this point. The sharpness of the edge mode is consistent with an ordinary phase in which electronic edge modes decouple from critical edge bosonic fluctuations. At the DQCP, the scaling dimension of the edge electron shows a jump, a feature argued to be a signature of the emergent anomaly. Our results are based on large-scale auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo this http URL also carry out calculations for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model to confirm spectral features of the ordinary and extraordinary-log phases in the vicinity of the bulk critical point.

Title: Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials
Authors: Cheng-Tai Lee, Tom Lubensky, Tomer Markovich
Abstract: Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.

Title: Nature of field-induced transitions and hysteretic magnetoresistance in non-collinear antiferromagnet EuIn2As2
Authors: Karan Singh, Jan Skolimowski, Giuseppe Cuono, Raghottam M. Sattigeri, Andrzej Ptok, Orest Pavlosiuk, Tetiana Romanova, Tomasz Tolinski, Piotr Wisniewski, Carmine Autieri, Dariusz Kaczorowski
Abstract: We examine the magnetic and electrical transport properties of the hexagonal EuIn2As2 compound, combining experimental and theoretical results. This compound is predicted to be an axion-insulator from an electronic point of view and an altermagnet while in the collinear magnetic phase. However, experiments indicate that the Fermi level lies within the valence band rather than in the topological gap, potentially leading to the dominance of magnetic properties. Our detailed studies on magnetization and electrical transport support the presence of a broken-helix antiferromagnetic state, which was previously identified by X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments. Notably, we observed within that state a field-induced metamagnetic transition marked by a large hysteresis in magnetoresistance, which turns into a sharp upturn for the magnetic field tilted by 15 degree from the c-axis of the crystal. Combined with theoretical calculations, it is explained that the application of a magnetic field changes the low-resistivity antiferromagnetic domain walls to the high-resistivity domain walls due to the reduction in the Fermi surface sheets interaction area in the domain walls, originating from p-orbitals of As. EuIn2As2, therefore, presents a new case study that broadens the understanding of complex magnetic structures and their influence on electrical transport.

Title: Structural and helix reversal defects of carbon nanosprings
Authors: Alexander V. Savin, Elena A. Korznikova, Sergey V. Dmitriev
Abstract: Due to their chiral structure, carbon nanosprings possess unique properties that are promising for nanotechnology applications. The structural transformations of carbon nanosprings in the form of spiral macromolecules derived from planar coronene and kekulene molecules (graphene helicoids and spiral nanoribbons) are analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations. While the tension/compression of such nanosprings has been analyzed in the literature, this study investigates other modes of deformation, including bending and twisting. Depending on the geometric characteristics of the carbon nanosprings, the formation of structural and helix reversal defects is described. It is found that nanosprings demonstrate a significantly higher coefficient of axial thermal expansion than many metals and alloys. These results are useful for designing nanosensors that operate over a wide temperature range.

Title: $β$-Irida-Graphene: A New 2D Carbon Allotrope for Sodium-Ion Battery Anodes
Authors: José A. S. Laranjeira, Kleuton A. L. Lima, Nicolas F. Martins, Luiz A. Ribeiro Junior, Douglas S. Galvão, Luis A. Cabral, Julio R. Sambrano
Abstract: The quest for sustainable and efficient energy storage has driven the exploration of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as promising alternatives to lithium-ion systems. However, the larger ionic radius of sodium poses intrinsic challenges such as slow diffusion and structural strain in conventional electrode materials. As a contribution to addressing these limitations, the \b{eta}-Irida-graphene ($\beta$-IG) is herein introduced, a novel two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope derived from Irida-graphene, featuring a diverse polygonal lattice of 3-, 4-, 6-, 8-, and 9-membered carbon rings. Through density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, $\beta$-IG demonstrated remarkable thermal, dynamical, and mechanical stability, coupled with intrinsic conductive character and efficient sodium-ion mobility (energy barriers < 0.30 eV). Furthermore, the adsorption of sodium ions was energetically favorable, delivering an impressive predicted specific capacity of 554.5 mAh/g. The reported findings highlight $\beta$-IG as a good potential anode candidate for next-generation SIBs, offering high-rate performance and structural robustness, and expanding the functional design space for advanced carbon-based electrode materials.

Title: Adiabatic protocol for the generalized Langevin equation
Authors: Pedro J. Colmenares
Abstract: This article proposes a self-consistent methodology for determining the work involved in an adiabatic process where the dynamics of a Brownian particle is trapped in an optical tweezers. Instead of varying the frequency of the trap, it is displaced through a defined protocol. Assuming the dynamics follow a modified generalized Langevin equation previously proposed by the author, it is found that the external adiabatic driving is uniquely derived in terms of the system's dynamical properties, and unlike isothermal processes, does not require optimization. There is no need to include other parameters than those characterizing the model.

Title: Density of States (Gate) - Controlled Andreev Molecule and Sensor

Abstract: Topological quantum computing typically relies on topological Andreev bound states (ABSs) engineered in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices, where gate control offers key advantages. While strong Zeeman fields can induce such states, an alternative approach emerges through Andreev molecules -- closely spaced, coupled ABSs, also key building-block for Kitaev chain -- that enable topological behavior without high magnetic fields. However, existing Andreev molecules are controlled via magnetic flux in superconducting loops, limiting scalability. Here, we introduce a gate-controlled Andreev molecule, where electrostatic tuning of the density of states in one site nonlocally enhances the critical current of another. This eliminates superconducting loops, offering superior tunability, scalability, and sensitivity. We further extend such an Andreev molecule to a multi-site Kitaev chain, and a noninvasive sensor resolving single-Cooper-pair charge for parity readout. This platform bridges the gap between scalable ABS engineering and high-sensitivity quantum sensing, advancing the development for constructing and parity-readout in topological ABSs and long Kitaev chains towards topological qubits.

Title: Localization structure of electronic states in the quantum Hall effect
Authors: Alioune Seye, Marcel Filoche
Abstract: We investigate the localization of electronic states in the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) using a magnetic localization landscape (MLL) approach. By studying a continuum Schrödinger model with disordered electrostatic potential, we demonstrate that the MLL, defined via a modified landscape function incorporating magnetic effects, captures key features of quantum state localization. The MLL effective potential reveals the spatial confinement regions and provides predictions of eigenstate energies, particularly in regimes where traditional semiclassical approximations break down. Numerical simulations show that below a critical energy, states localize around minima of the effective potential, while above it, they cluster around maxima-with edge effects becoming significant near boundaries. Bridging the gap between semiclassical intuition and full quantum models, the MLL offers a robust framework to understand transport and localization in disordered quantum Hall systems, and extends the applicability of landscape theory to magnetic systems.

Title: Moisture-driven CO2 direct air capture and delivery for cultivating cyanobacteria

Abstract: A moisture-driven air capture system was developed and demonstrated for cultivating cyanobacteria and microalgae at the flask (50 mL), bench (12 L) and small pilot (840 L) scale. Purolite A501 anion exchange resin beads were found to be biocompatible and rapidly deliver air-captured CO2 when immersed directly in an alkaline cultivation medium containing cyanobacteria or microalgae. Flask-scale cultivation trials showed A501 could sustain rapid growth (190 mg/L/d) of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strain engineered to produce laurate. A bench-scale system installed in a laminar flow hood was able to deliver 2 g CO2/d into abiotic alkaline cultivation medium and 0.5 g/d in the presence of Synechocystis to support vigorous growth (39 mg/L/d) limited by the CO2 delivered by the sorbent. A small pilot-scale system installed in a 4.2 m2 outdoor raceway pond in Mesa, Arizona was able to deliver 100 g CO2/d into abiotic alkaline cultivation medium. Exopolysaccharides and other products excreted by Synechocystis 6803 covered the sorbent beads, reducing their capacity to 25%, which could be partially restored to 70% capacity using a wash protocol, but the CO2 delivery kinetics remained 3-4 fold slower. Analysis of the sorbent beads used as part of four separate outdoor cultivation trials with over 300 days of outdoor wet and dry cycling over four seasons showed significant mechanical fracturing. Infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis showed a significant loss of NR4+ functional groups necessary for CO2 capture correlated with extended use. Under the assumption that abiotic performance eventually can be retained by delivering CO2 into the media recycle stream in a way that avoids biofouling, technoeconomic and life cycle analyses show the viability of a small first-of-a-kind biorefinery producing 500 barrels per day of biofuel.

Title: Using Topology to Predict Electrides in the Solid State
Authors: Stefano Racioppi, Eva Zurek
Abstract: Electrides are characterized by electron density highly localized in interstitial sites, which do not coincide with the interatomic contacts. The rigorous quantum mechanical definition of electrides is based upon topological criteria derived from the electron density, and in particular the presence of non-nuclear attractors (NNAs). We employ these topological criteria in combination with crystal structure prediction methods (the XtalOpt evolutionary algorithm), to accelerate the discovery of crystalline electrides at ambient and non-ambient pressures. The localization and quantification of NNAs is used as the primary discriminator for the electride character of a solid within a multi-objective evolutionary structure search. We demonstrate the reliability of this approach through a comprehensive crystal structure prediction study of Ca5Pb3 at 20 GPa, a system previously theorized to exhibit electride character under compression. Our strategy could predict, and sort on-the-fly, several unknown low-enthalpy phases that possess NNAs in interstitial loci, such as the newly discovered P4/mmm structure. These results demonstrate how evolutionary algorithms, guided by rigorous topological descriptors, can be relied upon to effectively survey complex phases to find new electride candidates.

Title: Intertwined Electron pairing in the Bilayer Two-orbital Kanamori-Hubbard Model: a Unified Picture of Two Superconductivities in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$
Authors: Shicong Mo, Yaoyuan Zheng, Wei Wu
Abstract: The mechanism of pairing in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ bulk and film superconductors remains actively debated. Here, we investigate the bilayer two-orbital Kanamori-Hubbard model for $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ using cellular dynamical mean-field theory. We find two intertwined $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivities with distinct physical origins under enhanced Hund's coupling $J_H$. We show that when $d_{z^2}$ orbital is half-filled and its bonding band lies below Fermi level, electron pairing associated to $J_H$ prevails. As $d_{z^2}$ orbital is hole-doped, this superconducting state becomes suppressed and a second superconductivity, which is largely insensitive to $J_H$ but exhibiting a critical reliance on $d_{z^2}$ - $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hybridization $V$, arises. These two pairing states exhibit comparable maximum transition temperatures and evolve continuously from one to the other with varying $d_{z^2}$ doping, resulting a smooth $T_c$ versus doping evolution. The dependence on various physical parameters of the two superconductivities is studied. Our results present a unified picture reconciling the debate about the role of $d_{z^2}$ orbital in pairing. We discuss the relevance of our results to recent experiments on superconducting $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ films.

Title: Quantum and classical Shapiro steps in small Josephson junctions
Authors: Miriam Resch, Joachim Ankerhold, Brecht I. C. Donvil, Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi, Dmitry Golubev
Abstract: We propose a model describing the formation of both dual (quantum) and classical Shapiro steps in small Josephson junctions. According to this model, the dual Shapiro steps are formed at relatively low frequency of the microwave signal and low microwave power, while the classical steps are formed in the opposite limit of high frequency and power. The crossover between the two regimes is controlled by a single parameter - the effective relaxation time of the environment. The model accounts for the effect of a large inductor in the bias circuit, which has been used in recent experiments to protect the junction from the high frequency noise of the environment. We predict the possibility of observing both types of steps in the same sample. Our model describes the I-V curves observed in the experiments with reasonable accuracy, thus opening up an opportunity for quantitative fitting of the data.

Title: Unveiling quantum criticality of disordered Aubry-André-Harper models via typical fidelity susceptibility
Authors: Tian-Cheng Yi, Ying-Ying Fang, Wen Chen, Wen-Long You, Yunbo Zhang
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the localization transition and quantum criticality {in the ground state of the} disordered Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model, where a quasiperiodic potential is hybridized with a disordered potential. In the clean limit, the AAH model undergoes a localization transition from an extended phase to a localized phase via an intermediate critical phase as the strength of the quasiperiodic potential is varied. While the staggered potential merely shifts the critical point to a lower value, Fibonacci and Thue-Morse potentials induce immediate localization. This contrast reveals the sensitivity of localization behavior to the structural complexity of the potential, with the onset of localization correlating with the sequence's complexity. More specifically, the system follows a hierarchy defined by the complexity measures of the applied potentials. In addition, the typical fidelity susceptibility exhibits a power-law scaling behavior at the localization transition, enabling reliable extraction of the critical exponent. We focus on the AAH model with the Fibonacci potential due to its minimal finite-size effects compared to other cases. For the disordered AAH model with the Fibonacci potential, we determine critical exponents that differ from those of the AAH model without disorder and the Anderson model. Moreover, despite differences in localization behavior, we find that the disordered AAH models with the staggered potential and the Fibonacci potential share the same correlation-length critical exponent. These findings provide a unified framework for understanding localization transitions in quasiperiodic systems and are amenable to experimental validation using emerging techniques.

Title: Growth of few-layer molecular crystals of PTCDI on hexagonal boron nitride by microspacing air-gap sublimation
Authors: Nils LeCoutre, Tolibjon Abdurakhmonov, Paul Weinbrenner, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Tobias Korn, Franziska Fennel, Oliver Kühn, Friedemann Reinhard
Abstract: Extended two-dimensional (2D) crystals of dye molecules adsorbed on 2D material substrates like boron nitride have recently become a subject of intense study, with potential applications ranging from quantum technology to optoelectronics. The most established technique for the production of these films is physical vapor transport in vacuum. We demonstrate that few-layer crystalline films of the organic dye molecule PTCDI on boron nitride can be produced by microspacing in-air sublimation, a radically simplified technique, not requiring complicated vacuum systems. The resulting layers display clearly resolved atomic step terraces in atomic force microscopy, and a clear polarization anisotropy in their fluorescence, confirming molecular alignment and long-range order. Using density functional theory and classical molecular dynamics simulations, the canted motive is identified as the most likely building block for the morphology of a PTDCI monolayer on the hBN substrate.

Title: A unified model for linear responses of physical networks
Authors: José M. Ortiz-Tavárez, William Stephenson, Xiaoming Mao
Abstract: Many physical systems--from mechanical lattices and electrical circuits to biological tissues and architected metamaterials--can be understood as networks transmitting physical quantities. We present a unified mathematical framework for describing linear responses of such physical networks using tools from algebraic graph theory. This approach captures static and dynamic behaviors across multiple domains, including mechanical, electrical, thermal, and diffusive responses using node and edge variables (e.g., potentials, flows). Our formalism connects multiscale and multi-domain responses to the underlying network structure. We demonstrate how this framework enables efficient, generalizable solutions to a wide class of linear response problems, including stress propagation, charge transport, and wave dynamics, and provide insights into network duality and entropy production.

Title: Light induced transitions of valley Chern numbers and flat bands in a non-twisted moire graphene-hexagonal boron nitride superlattice
Authors: Saud Alabdulal, Miftah Hadi Syahputra Anfa, Hocine Bahlouli, Michael Vogl
Abstract: Motivated by the rich topology and interesting quasi-band structure of twisted moire materials subjected to light, we study a non-twisted moire material under the influence of light. Our work is in part motivated by a desire to find an easier-to-synthesize platform that can help experimentally elucidate the interesting physics of moiré materials coupled to light. Similar to twisted moire materials, we uncover rich topology and interesting band flattening effects, which we summarize in relevant plots such as a topological phase diagram. Our work demonstrates that much of the interesting phenomenology of twisted moire materials under the influence of electromagnetic waves seems to be generically present even in more experimentally accessible untwisted moire platforms, which remain highly tunable by light.

Title: Simulations of dielectric permittivity of water by Machine Learned Potentials with long-range Coulombic interactions
Authors: Kehan Cai, Chunyi Zhang, Xifan Wu
Abstract: The dielectric permittivity of liquid water is a fundamental property that underlies its distinctive behaviors in numerious physical, biological, and chemical processes. Within a machine learning framework, we present a unified approach to compute the dielectric permittivity of water, systematically incorporating various electric boundary conditions. Our method employs a long-range-inclusive deep potential trained on data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. Dielectric response is evaluated using an auxiliary deep neural network that predicts the centers of maximally localized Wannier functions. We investigate three types of electric boundary conditions--metallic, insulating, and Kirkwood-Frohlich--to assess their influence on correlated dipole fluctuations and dielectric relaxation dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate a consistent methodology for computing the Kirkwood correlation factor, correlation length, and dielectric permittivity under each boundary condition, where long-range electrostatics play a critical role. This work establishes a robust and generalizable machine-learning framework for modeling the dielectric properties of polar liquids under diverse electrostatic environments.

Title: Stochastic Calculus for Pathwise Observables of Markov-Jump Processes: Unification of Diffusion and Jump Dynamics
Authors: Lars Torbjørn Stutzer, Cai Dieball, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: Path-wise observables--functionals of stochastic trajectories--are at the heart of time-average statistical mechanics and are central to thermodynamic inequalities such as uncertainty relations, speed limits, and correlation-bounds. They provide a means of thermodynamic inference in the typical situation, when not all dissipative degrees of freedom in a system are experimentally accessible. So far, theories focusing on path-wise observables have been developing in two major directions, diffusion processes and Markov-jump dynamics, in a virtually disjoint manner. Moreover, even the respective results for diffusion and jump dynamics were derived with a patchwork of different approaches that are predominantly indirect. Stochastic calculus was recently shown to provide a direct approach to path-wise observables of diffusion processes, while a corresponding framework for jump dynamics remained elusive. In our work we develop, in an exact parallelism with continuous-space diffusion, a complete stochastic calculus for path-wise observables of Markov-jump processes. We formulate a "Langevin equation" for jump processes, define general path-wise observables, and establish their covariation structure, whereby we fully account for transients and time-inhomogeneous dynamics. We prove the known kinds of thermodynamic inequalities in their most general form and discus saturation conditions. We determine the response of path-wise observables to general (incl. thermal) perturbations and carry out the continuum limit to achieve the complete unification of diffusion and jump dynamics. Our results open new avenues in the direction of discrete-state analogs of generative diffusion models and the learning of stochastic thermodynamics from fluctuating trajectories.

Title: Tailored Thermal and Mechanical Performance of Biodegradable PLA-P(VDF-TrFE) Polymer Blends
Authors: G Suresh, B. Satyanarayana, C. Thirmal, Kaushal Jagarlamudi, T Komala, Jimlee Patowary, Ashutosh Kumar
Abstract: The development of polymer blends has emerged as a strategic approach for designing multifunctional materials with enhanced tailored characteristics. Current work investigates and reports for the first time, the structure-property relationships in free-standing blend films of poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) and polylactic acid (PLA), prepared to evaluate their suitability for functional applications. For this investigation, films of approximately 40 $\mu$m thick were fabricated by systematically varying the P(VDF-TrFE):PLA ratio. Thermal analysis revealed a higher PLA crystallinity at 25\% P(VDF-TrFE) content, while Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed the electroactive $\beta$-phase fraction to be highest in the 50:50 composition. These findings correlated with tensile strength measurements and morphology, demonstrating that molecular ordering and phase distribution significantly influence the mechanical performance. The 25:75 blend exhibited superior mechanical strength due to enhanced PLA crystallization and polymer chain alignment. In contrast, the 50:50 blend achieved a balance between tensile modulus and electroactive phase development, marking it a promising candidate for sensors and 3D printing applications. At higher P(VDF-TrFE) content, reduced crystallinity in PLA resulted in softer, more compliant films which would be suitable for flexible electronic applications. These results establish a pathway to tune mechanical and functional properties in semicrystalline polymer blends through facile compositional control.

Title: Diffusion in a $d$-dimensional rough potential
Authors: Jacob Jeffries, Emilio Mendoza Reyes, Fadi Abdeljawad, Murray Daw, Enrique Martinez
Abstract: The prediction of diffusion in solids is necessary to understand the microstructure evolution in materials out of equilibrium. Although one can reasonably predict diffusive transport coefficients using atomistic methods, these approaches can be very computationally expensive. In this work, we develop an analytical model for the diffusivity in a noisy solid solution in an arbitrary number of dimensions using a mean first passage time analysis. These analytical results are then compared with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, which are in good agreement with the simulation data in the low-noise limit. We argue that the difference is expected from percolation pathways that increase the diffusivity in the KMC analysis but are not captured by the model. This generalization to arbitrary dimensions has been elusive to the community since Zwanzig [PNAS, 85, 2029 (1988)] published his seminal work on 1-dimensional systems.

Title: A colossal dielectric response of HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles
Authors: Oleksandr S. Pylypchuk, Victor V. Vainberg, Vladimir N. Poroshin, Oksana V. Leshchenko, Victor N. Pavlikov, Irina V. Kondakova, Serhii E. Ivanchenko, Lesya P. Yurchenko, Lesya Demchenko, Anna O. Diachenko, Myroslav V. Karpets, Mikhail P. Trubitsyn, Eugene A. Eliseev, Anna N. Morozovska
Abstract: We reveal a colossal dielectric response of small (5 - 10 nm) oxygen-deficient HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles (x = 1 - 0.4), prepared by the solid-state organonitrate synthesis. The effective dielectric permittivity of the pressed HfxZr1-xO2 nanopowders has a pronounced maximum at 38 - 88 C, which shape can be fitted by the Curie-Weiss type dependence modified for the diffuse ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition. The maximal value of the dielectric permittivity increases from 1.5*10^3 (for x = 1) to 1.5*10^5 (for x= 0.4) at low frequencies (~4 Hz); being much smaller, namely changing from 7 (for x = 1) to 20 (for x = 0.4) at high frequencies (~500 kHz). The frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity maximum position is almost absent, meanwhile the shape and width of the maximum changes in a complex way with increase in frequency. The temperature dependencies of the dielectric permittivity and resistivity are almost mirror-like turned over in respect to each other, which means that all their features, such as position and shape of maxima, plateau, minima and inflexions, almost coincide after the mirror reflection in respect to the temperature axis. These correlations of resistivity and dielectric permittivity are well-described in the Heywang barrier model applied together with the variable range hopping conduction model in semiconducting ferroelectrics. The ferroelectric-like behavior of the dielectric permittivity is explained by the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory calculations, which reveal that small HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles can become ferroelectric in the presence of oxygen vacancies. Obtained results may be useful for developing silicon-compatible ferroelectric nanomaterials based on HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles.

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift, and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements. Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet, an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated characterization.

Title: The Cost of Nonlocality: A Dynamical Performance Equation of Energy-Entanglement-Complexity
Authors: HongZheng Liu, YiNuo Tian, Zhiyue Wu
Abstract: This work aims to quantify the physical cost of generating non-local entanglement in systems governed by local interactions. By unifying the quantum speed limit and Lieb-Robinson bounds, we establish an "energy-entanglement performance equation." This framework connects theoretical computational complexity with experimental observables by introducing a measurable proxy for complexity, thereby revealing a performance trade-off among the "energy variance-entanglement product," the strength of local interactions, and dynamical efficiency. Our work not only defines a "performance frontier"-constrained by theoretical bounds and amenable to experimental benchmarking-but also provides a novel diagnostic tool for identifying the performance bottlenecks of a process.

Title: Geometric fragmentation and anomalous thermalization in cubic dimer model
Authors: Joel Steinegger, Debasish Banerjee, Emilie Huffman, Lukas Rammelmüller
Abstract: While quantum statistical mechanics triumphs in explaining many equilibrium phenomena, there is an increasing focus on going beyond conventional scenarios of thermalization. Traditionally examples of non-thermalizing systems are either integrable, or disordered. Recently, examples of translationally-invariant physical systems have been discovered whose excited energies avoid thermalization either due to local constraints (whether exact or emergent), or due to higher-form symmetries. In this article, we extend these investigations for the case of 3D $U(1)$ quantum dimer models, which are lattice gauge theories with finite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces (also generically called quantum link models) with staggered charged static matter. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we uncover a class of athermal states that arise in large winding sectors, when the system is subjected to external electric fields. The polarization of the dynamical fluxes in the direction of applied field traps excitations in 2D planes, while an interplay with the Gauss Law constraint in the perpendicular direction causes exotic athermal behaviour due to the emergence of new conserved quantities. This causes a geometric fragmentation of the system. We provide analytical arguments showing that the scaling of the number of fragments is exponential in the linear system size, leading to weak fragmentation. Further, we identify sectors which host fractonic excitations with severe mobility restrictions. The unitary evolution of fragments dominated by fractons is qualitatively different from the one dominated by non-fractonic excitations.

Title: H$_2$O and CO$_2$ sorption in ion exchange sorbents: distinct interactions in amine versus quaternary ammonium materials
Authors: Golnaz Najaf Tomaraei, Sierra Binney, Ryan Stratton, Houlong Zhuang, Jennifer L. Wade
Abstract: This study investigates the H$_2$O  and CO$_2$ sorption behavior of two ion exchange sorbents: a primary amine and a permanently charged strong base quaternary ammonium (QA) groups with (bi)carbonate counter-anions. We compare their distinct interactions with H$_2$O  and CO$_2$ through simultaneous thermal gravimetric, calorimetric, gas analysis and molecular modeling to evaluate their performance for dilute CO$_2$ separations like direct air capture. Thermal and hybrid (heat + low-temperature hydration) desorption experiments demonstrate that the QA-based sorbent binds both water and CO$_2$ more strongly than the amine counterparts but undergoes degradation at moderate temperatures, limiting its compatibility with thermal swing regeneration. However, a low-temperature moisture-driven regeneration pathway at is uniquely effective for the QA-based sorbent. To inform the energetics of a moisture-based CO$_2$ separation, we compare calorimetric water sorption enthalpies to isosteric enthalpies. To our knowledge, this includes the first direct measurement of water sorption enthalpy in the QA-based sorbent. Molecular modeling supports this observation, showing higher water sorption energies and denser charge distributions in the QA-based sorbent. Mixed gas experiments in QA-based sorbent show that not only does water influence CO$_2$ binding, but CO$_2$ influences water uptake through counterion-dependent hydration states, and that moisture swing responsiveness in this material causes hydration-induced CO$_2$ release and drying-induced CO$_2$ uptake, an important feature for low-energy CO$_2$ separation under ambient conditions. Overall, the two classes of sorbents offer distinct pathways for CO$_2$ separation. Primary amine-based sorbent relies on weaker hydrogen bonding and CO$_2$-amine interactions, while QA-based sorbent leverages stronger electrostatic coupling between water and QA-reactive anion pairs.

Title: Quantum chemistry for solids made simple with the Clifford formalism
Authors: Amer Alrakik, Gian Luigi Bendazzoli, Stefano Evangelisti, J. Arjan Berger
Abstract: We present a general theory to treat periodic solids with quantum-chemistry methods. It relies on two main developments: 1) the modeling of a solid as a Clifford torus which is a torus that is both periodic and flat and 2) the introduction of a periodic gaussian basis set that is compatible with the topology of the Clifford torus. We illustrate our approach by calculating the ground-state energy of a periodic chain of hydrogen atoms within both Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster theory. We demonstrate that our approach yields the correct ground-state energy in the thermodynamic limit by comparing it to the ground-state energy of a ring of hydrogen atoms in the same limit. Since equivalent ring-like calculations for three-dimensional solids are impossible, our approach is an excellent alternative to perform quantum-chemistry calculations of solids. Our Clifford formalism can be seamlessly combined with current implementations of quantum-chemistry methods designed for atoms and molecules to make them applicable to solids.

Title: Charge sensitivity in the transmon regime
Authors: Rocio Gonzalez-Meza, Vito Iaia, Anika Zaman, Hiu-Yung Wong, Yujin Cho, Kristin Beck, Yaniv J. Rosen
Abstract: Transmons are widely adopted in quantum computing architectures for their engineered insensitivity to charge noise and correspondingly long relaxation times. Despite this advantage, transmons often exhibit large fluctuations in dephasing times across different devices and also within qubits on the same device. Existing transmon qubits are assumed to be insensitive to charge noise. However, very little recent attention has been paid to the dependence of dephasing on the local charge environment. In this study, we see fluctuations in the dephasing time, $T_{\phi}$, which correlate to charge offset. While charge offset fluctuations are slow, parity switches are fast processes tied to the charge offset and can affect $T_{\phi}$ in Ramsey experiments. We implement a protocol to detect parity switching events using single-shot methods, which are interleaved within a Ramsey measurement. We find that events that remain in the same parity state have a higher $T_2$ than measurements averaged over both parities. Our results show that transmons can be limited by charge-noise, even with $E_\text{J}/E_\text{C} \approx 50$. Consequently, parity flip rates must be considered as a device characterization metric.

Title: Graphical Calculus for Fermionic Tensors
Authors: Yuanjie Ren, Kaifeng Bu, Andreas Bauer
Abstract: We introduce a graphical calculus, consisting of a set of fermionic tensors with tensor-network equations, which can be used to perform various computations in fermionic many-body physics purely diagrammatically. The indices of our tensors primarily correspond to fermionic modes, but also include qubits and fixed odd-parity states. Our graphical calculus extends the ZX calculus for systems involving qubits. We apply the calculus in order to represent various objects, operations, and computations in physics, including fermionic Gaussian states, the partial trace of Majorana modes, purification protocols, fermionization and bosonization maps, and the construction of fermionic codes.

Title: Thermalization with partial information
Authors: Philippe Faist, Sumeet Khatri
Abstract: A many-body system, whether in contact with a large environment or evolving under complex dynamics, can typically be modeled as occupying the thermal state singled out by Jaynes' maximum entropy principle. Here, we find analogous fundamental principles identifying a noisy quantum channel $\mathcal{T}$ to model the system's dynamics, going beyond the study of its final equilibrium state. Our maximum channel entropy principle states that $\mathcal{T}$ should maximize the channel's entropy, suitably defined, subject to any available macroscopic constraints. These may correlate input and outputs, and may lead to restricted or partial thermalizing dynamics including thermalization with average energy conservation. This principle is reinforced by an independent extension of the microcanonical derivation of the thermal state to channels, which leads to the same $\mathcal{T}$. Our technical contributions include a derivation of the general mathematical structure of $\mathcal{T}$, a custom postselection theorem relating an arbitrary permutation-invariant channel to nearby i.i.d. channels, as well as novel typicality results for quantum channels for noncommuting constraints and arbitrary input states. We propose a learning algorithm for quantum channels based on the maximum channel entropy principle, demonstrating the broader relevance of $\mathcal{T}$ beyond thermodynamics and complex many-body systems.

Title: Maximum channel entropy principle and microcanonical channels
Authors: Philippe Faist, Sumeet Khatri
Abstract: The thermal state plays a number of significant roles throughout physics, information theory, quantum computing, and machine learning. It arises from Jaynes' maximum-entropy principle as the maximally entropic state subject to linear constraints, and is also the reduced state of the microcanonical state on the system and a large environment. We formulate a maximum-channel-entropy principle, defining a thermal channel as one that maximizes a channel entropy measure subject to linear constraints on the channel. We prove that thermal channels exhibit an exponential form reminiscent of thermal states. We study examples including thermalizing channels that conserve a state's average energy, as well as Pauli-covariant and classical channels. We propose a quantum channel learning algorithm based on maximum channel entropy methods that mirrors a similar learning algorithm for quantum states. We then demonstrate the thermodynamic relevance of the maximum-channel-entropy channel by proving that it resembles the action on a single system of a microcanonical channel acting on many copies of the system. Here, the microcanonical channel is defined by requiring that the linear constraints obey sharp statistics for any i.i.d. input state, including for noncommuting constraint operators. Our techniques involve convex optimization methods to optimize recently introduced channel entropy measures, typicality techniques involving noncommuting operators, a custom channel postselection technique, as well as Schur-Weyl duality. As a result of potential independent interest, we prove a constrained postselection theorem for quantum channels. The widespread relevance of the thermal state throughout physics, information theory, machine learning, and quantum computing, inspires promising applications for the analogous concept for quantum channels.

Title: Generalising the Central Dogma as a cross-hierarchical principle of biology
Authors: Nobuto Takeuchi, Kunihiko Kaneko
Abstract: The Central Dogma of molecular biology, as originally proposed by Crick, asserts that information passed into protein cannot flow back out. This principle has been interpreted as underpinning modern understandings of heredity and evolution, implying the unidirectionality of information flow from nucleic acids to proteins. Here, we propose a generalisation of the Central Dogma as a division of labour between the transmission and expression of information: the transmitter (nucleic acids) perpetuates information across generations, whereas the expressor (protein) enacts this information to facilitate the transmitter's function without itself perpetuating information. We argue that this generalisation offers two benefits. First, it provides a unifying perspective for comparing the Central Dogma to analogous divisions of labour observed at vastly different biological scales, including multicellular organisms, eukaryotic cells, organelles, and bacteria. Second, it offers a theoretical framework to explain the Central Dogma as an outcome of evolution. Specifically, we review a mathematical model suggesting that the Central Dogma originates through spontaneous symmetry breaking driven by evolutionary conflicts between different levels of selection. By reframing the Central Dogma as an informational relationship between components of a system, this generalisation underscores its broader relevance across the biological hierarchy and sheds light on its evolutionary origin.

Title: Hybrid Quantum--Classical Machine Learning Potential with Variational Quantum Circuits
Authors: Soohaeng Yoo Willow, D. ChangMo Yang, Chang Woo Myung
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for simulating large and complex molecular systems are still in their infancy, and surpassing state-of-the-art classical techniques remains an ever-receding goal post. A promising avenue of inquiry in the meanwhile is to seek practical advantages through hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, which combine conventional neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) running on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Such hybrids are well suited to NISQ hardware. The classical processor performs the bulk of the computation, while the quantum processor executes targeted sub-tasks that supply additional non-linearity and expressivity. Here, we benchmark a purely classical E(3)-equivariant message-passing machine learning potential (MLP) against a hybrid quantum-classical MLP for predicting density functional theory (DFT) properties of liquid silicon. In our hybrid architecture, every readout in the message-passing layers is replaced by a VQC. Molecular dynamics simulations driven by the HQC-MLP reveal that an accurate reproduction of high-temperature structural and thermodynamic properties is achieved with VQCs. These findings demonstrate a concrete scenario in which NISQ-compatible HQC algorithm could deliver a measurable benefit over the best available classical alternative, suggesting a viable pathway toward near-term quantum advantage in materials modeling.

Title: Entanglement and particle production from cosmological perturbations: a quantum optical simulation approach
Authors: Pramod Kamal Kharel, Mausam Ghimire, Ashish Khanal, Samyam Pudasaini, Nabaraj Khatri, Sayujya Bhandari, Divash Rai, Kiran Adhikari, Rajeev Singh
Abstract: In this work, we develop a computational framework based on the Gaussian formalism and symplectic circuit representation to explore cosmological perturbations during inflation. These tools offer an efficient means to study entanglement generation and particle production, particularly when analytical methods become insufficient and numerical simulations are essential. By evolving an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum through a two-mode squeezer, we simulate the behavior of the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity across a wide range of cosmological backgrounds, each characterized by a distinct equation of state. The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic Rényi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios. We further investigate the role of thermal noise and demonstrate how the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity are affected by its presence.

Title: Almost local integrable models from supersymmetry algebras
Authors: Somnath Maity, Pramod Padmanabhan, Jarmo Hietarinta, Vladimir Korepin
Abstract: Supersymmetry algebras can be used to obtain algebraic expressions for constant Yang-Baxter solutions, also known as braid group generators. This was done for non-invertible braid operators in \cite{maity2025non}. In this work we extend this construction for the invertible ones. The resulting expressions are then shown to obey relations analogous to those satisfied by quotients of braid groups. Examples of the latter include the Iwahori-Hecke algebra and the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) algebra. As a result, we can Baxterize the constant Yang-Baxter solutions to yield spectral parameter dependent $R$-matrices. The regularity of these $R$-matrices depend on the representation of SUSY generators. In some cases they are regular in the usual sense and in the remaining they are `almost' regular. In the latter case they are also non-invertible. Nevertheless we show that they can still help us construct integrable models in all dimensions of the local Hilbert space. These models can be described by Hamiltonian densities that are either local or non-local, depending on the representation chosen for the SUSY generators. We demonstrate this for all constant $4\times 4$ invertible Yang-Baxter solutions. Apart from finding new nearest-neighbor interaction spin $\frac{1}{2}$ systems, we also find their higher spin analogs due to the algebraic [representation independent] approach.

Title: High-Sensitivity Photonic Crystal Biosensors using Topological Light Trapping
Authors: Zhengzheng Zhai, Sajeev John
Abstract: Photonic crystals (PCs) with localized optical cavity modes arising from topological domain-wall line defects are simulated for optical biosensing by numerical solution of Maxwell's equations. These consist of a square lattice of square silicon blocks with a significant photonic band gap (PBG). Optical transmission through the PBG at specific frequencies occurs by defect-mediated optical tunneling. Biofluid flows perpendicular to light propagation, through a channel containing the PC, defined by silica side-walls and an underlying silica substrate. Replacing the silicon blocks with thin silicon strips throughout the domain-wall region, analyte binding coincides with regions of maximal field intensity. As a result, the sensitivity is improved by almost 16 times higher than the previous designs. We analyze optical mode hybridization of two nearby domain walls and its close relation to the transmission-levels and correlations in frequency shifts of nearby optical resonances in response to analyte-bindings. We illustrate three high-sensitivity chips each with three domain-wall defects, all of which can distinguish three analyte-bindings and their combinations completely in a single spectroscopic measurement. In a photonic crystal, consisting of silicon squares embedded in a water background and a 5-micron lattice spacing, the biosensor sensitivity to a thin analyte binding layer is nearly 3000 nm/RIU, and to the overall background biofluid is over 8000 nm/RIU.

Title: Probing the statistics of sequence-dependent DNA conformations in solution using SAXS
Authors: Heidar J. Koning, Anuradha Pullakhandam, Andrew E. Whitten, Charles S. Bond, Michel Peyrard
Abstract: SAXS studies of four 60 base-pair DNA duplexes with sequences closely related to part of the GAGE6 (G-antigen 6) promoter have been performed to study the role of DNA conformations in solution and their potential relationship to DNA-protein binding. We show that the SAXS data can be analysed using a simple polymer model which nevertheless quantitatively describes the average persistence length and torsional rigidity of the DNA double helix to determine the statistical distribution of local conformations of the DNA in solution to a high accuracy. Although the SAXS data is averaged over time and all spatial orientations of the molecules, for sequences which have some asymmetry in the data we show that the conformations can be oriented with respect to the sequence. This allows specific features detected by the analysis to be precisely related to the DNA sequence, opening up new opportunities for SAXS to investigate the properties of DNA in solution. The biological implications of these results are discussed.

Title: Tight-binding photonics
Authors: Jing Li, Aodong Li, Yutao Chen, Tao Xiao, Renwen Huang, Xiaolu Zhuo, Jun Guan, Zhen Gao, Peng Zhan, Minghui Lu, Biye Xie
Abstract: Photonics, dealing with the generation, manipulation, and detection of photons in various systems, lays the foundation of many advanced technologies. A key task of photonics is to know how photons propagate in complex media such as periodic and aperiodic photonic crystals. The conventional wisdom is to numerically solve the Maxwell equations either by dedicated numerical techniques or brute-force finite-element calculations. Recently, the strict analogy between photonic crystals and theoretical tight-binding models provides an unprecedentedly convenient wayof understanding the spectra and wavefunctions of photonic systems by mapping the complicated differential equationsinto matrixed Hamiltonians that can be easily solved through the band theory and exact diagonalization. in this paper, we present a timely review of tight-binding-like photonics in various platforms, covering fundamental theories, experimental realizations, unique physical efiects, and their potential applications. We also provide a brief outlook on the future trends of this active area. Our review offers an in-depth and comprehensive picture on this rapidly developing field and may shed light on the future design on advanced tight-binding-like photonic devices.

Title: Quantum circuit complexity and unsupervised machine learning of topological order
Authors: Yanming Che, Clemens Gneiting, Xiaoguang Wang, Franco Nori
Abstract: Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. To span a bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with fidelity change and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections, fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed kernels, numerical experiments targeting the unsupervised clustering of quantum phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's toric code and random product states, are conducted, demonstrating their superior performance. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally derived and understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, and machine learning of topological quantum order.

Title: Local-global correlations of dynamics on disordered energy landscapes
Authors: Jacob Calvert, Dana Randall
Abstract: The stationary distribution of a continuous-time Markov chain generally arises from a complicated global balance of probability fluxes. Nevertheless, empirical evidence shows that the effective potential, defined as the negative logarithm of the stationary distribution, is often highly correlated with a simple local property of a state: the logarithm of its exit rate. To better understand why and how typically this correlation is high, we study reversible reaction kinetics on energy landscapes consisting of Gaussian wells and barriers, respectively associated with the vertices and edges of regular graphs. We find that for the correlation to be high it suffices for the heights of the barriers to vary significantly less than the depths of the wells, regardless of the degree of the underlying graph. As an application, we bound below the expected correlation exhibited by dynamics of the random energy model, known as the Bouchaud trap model. We anticipate that the proof, which combines a general lower bound of the expected correlation with the Gaussian concentration inequality, can be extended to several other classes of models.

Title: A short combinatorial proof of Di Francesco's conjecture on Aztec triangles
Authors: Seok Hyun Byun, Mihai Ciucu
Abstract: Di Francesco conjectured in 2021 that the number of domino tilings of a certain family of regions -- called Aztec triangles -- on the square lattice is given by a product formula reminiscent of the one giving the number of alternating sign matrices. This turned out to be a real challenge to prove without the use of computers -- each of the two existing proofs (one due to Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser, the other to Corteel, Huang and Krattenthaler) relies on substantial computer calculations which would be hard to check directly. In this paper we present a short combinatorial proof that relies on the second author's factorization theorem and complementation theorem for perfect matchings.

Title: Functional mesoscale organization of complex networks
Authors: Arsham Ghavasieh, Satyaki Sikdar, Manlio De Domenico, Santo Fortunato
Abstract: The network density matrix (NDM) framework, enabling an information-theoretic and multiscale treatment of network flow, has been gaining momentum over the last decade. Benefiting from the counterparts of physical functions such as free energy and entropy, NDM's applications range from estimating how nodes influence network flows across scales the centrality of nodes at the local level to explaining the emergence of structural and functional order. Here, we introduce a generalized notion of the network internal energy $E_\tau$, where $\tau$ denotes a temporal hyperparameter allowing for multi-resolution analysis, showing how it measures the leakage of dynamical correlations from arbitrary partitions, where the minimally leaky subsystems have minimal $E_\tau$. Moreover, we analytically demonstrate that $E_\tau$ reduces to the well-known modularity function at the smallest temporal scale $\tau = 0$. We investigate this peculiar resemblance by comparing the communities minimizing $E_\tau$, with those detected by widely used methods like multiscale modularity and Markov stability. Our work provides a detailed analytical and computational picture of network generalized internal energy, and explores its effectiveness in detecting communities in synthetic and empirical networks within a unifying framework.

Title: Broadband Dipole Absorption in Dispersive Photonic Time Crystals
Authors: Thomas F. Allard, Jaime E. Sustaeta-Osuna, Francisco J. García-Vidal, Paloma A. Huidobro
Abstract: Photonic media modulated periodically in time, termed photonic time crystals (PTCs), have attracted considerable attention for their ability to open momentum bandgaps hosting amplifying modes. These momentum gaps, however, generally appear only at the system's parametric resonance condition which constrain many features derived from amplification to a narrow frequency band. Moreover, they are accompanied by exceptional points (EPs) that render their analysis more intricate. Here, we show that a careful consideration of dispersion and absorption can overcome these issues. By investigating the dissipated power of a point-dipole embedded in a dispersive and absorptive PTC, we unveil that temporal modulation enables the conversion of dipole emission into dipole absorption within a broadband frequency window free of EPs. We demonstrate that this effect is general and occurs from weak modulation strengths to low modulation frequencies, and can be achieved for various material platforms. Moreover, we show the possibility of both broadband inhibition and large increase of dissipated power, depending on the modulated parameter.

Title: Optimizing quantum transport via the quantum Doob transform
Authors: Dolores Esteve, Carlos Pérez-Espigares, Ricardo Gutiérrez, Daniel Manzano
Abstract: Quantum transport plays a central role in both fundamental physics and the development of quantum technologies. While significant progress has been made in understanding transport phenomena in quantum systems, methods for optimizing transport properties remain limited, particularly in complex quantum networks. Building on recent advances in classical network optimization via the generalized Doob transform, we introduce a novel method that extends this approach to quantum networks. Our framework leverages a single diagonalization of the system generator to efficiently tailor both the Hamiltonian and dissipative contributions, optimizing transport observables such as currents and activities. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness through extensive numerical explorations, showing that optimal performance arises from non-trivial modifications to both coherent and incoherent dynamics. We also assess the robustness of the optimization under constraints that preserve specific physical features, such as fixed dissipative structures and input-output interactions. Finally, we discuss the connection between optimized transport and centrosymmetry, highlighting the relevance of this property for enhanced transport efficiency in quantum systems.

Title: Finite 2-group gauge theory and its 3+1D lattice realization
Authors: Mo Huang
Abstract: In this work, we employ the Tannaka-Krein reconstruction to compute the quantum double $\mathcal D(\mathcal G)$ of a finite 2-group $\mathcal G$ as a Hopf monoidal category. We also construct a 3+1D lattice model from the Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT functor for the 2-group $\mathcal G$, generalizing Kitaev's 2+1D quantum double model. Notably, the string-like local operators in this lattice model are shown to form $\mathcal D(\mathcal G)$. Specializing to $\mathcal G = \mathbb{Z}_2$, we demonstrate that the topological defects in the 3+1D toric code model are modules over $\mathcal D(\mathbb{Z}_2)$.

Title: Pomeranchuk instability in the nematic phase of two monolayer FeSe/SrTiO3
Authors: C. Y. Tang, X.-L. Peng, Y.-H. Yuan, P. Zhang, G.-N. Phan, S.-Y. Gao, Y.-B. Huang, L.-Y. Kong, T. Qian, W. Li, Q.-K. Xue, Z.-Q. Wang, K. Jiang, Y.-J. Sun, H. Ding
Abstract: Nematicity, where electrons break rotational symmetry while preserving translational symmetry, is ubiquitous in strongly correlated quantum matters, including high-Tc cuprates and iron-based superconductors. A central question in nematicity is whether it is driven by Pomeranchuk instability in momentum space or orbital order (polarization) in real space, especially as nematicity intertwines with superconductivity. FeSe/SrTiO3 (STO), where nematicity occurs without long-range magnetic order, is an ideal platform for studying the nature and origin of the electronic nematicity. Here we present direct evidence of Pomeranchuk nematic order in two monolayer FeSe/STO using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, revealing a remarkable degeneracy of dxz and dyz bands at the Brillouin zone center, but a significant band separation at the zone corner. This momentum-dependent nematicity demonstrates that nematicity in FeSe/STO originates from the Pomeranchuk instability, offering insights into the relationship between nematicity and superconductivity. Our results establish two-dimensional FeSe thin film as a powerful platform for investigating quantum physics under complex intertwinement.

Title: Spatially-resolved dynamics of the amplitude Schmid-Higgs mode in disordered superconductors
Authors: P. A. Nosov, E. S. Andriyakhina, I. S. Burmistrov
Abstract: We investigate the spatially-resolved dynamics of the collective amplitude Schmid-Higgs (SH) mode in disordered $s$-wave superconductors and fermionic superfluids. By analyzing the analytic structure of the zero-temperature SH susceptibility in the complex frequency plane, we find that when the coherence length greatly exceeds the mean free path: (i) the SH response at fixed wave vectors exhibits late-time oscillations decaying as $1/t^2$ with frequency $2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the superconducting gap; (ii) sub-diffusive oscillations with a dynamical exponent $z{=}4$ emerge at late times and large distances; and (iii) spatial oscillations at fixed frequency decay exponentially, with a period that diverges as the frequency approaches $2\Delta$ from above. When the coherence length is comparable to the mean free path, additional exponentially-decaying oscillations at fixed wave vectors appear with frequency above $2\Delta$. Furthermore, we show that the SH mode induces an extra peak in the third-harmonic generation current at finite wave-vectors. The frequency of this peak is shifted from the conventional resonance at $\Delta$, thereby providing an unambiguous signature of order parameter amplitude dynamics.

Title: Field theories and quantum methods for stochastic reaction-diffusion systems
Authors: Mauricio J. del Razo, Tommaso Lamma, Wout Merbis
Abstract: Complex systems are composed of many particles or agents that move and interact with one another. The underlying mathematical framework to model many of these systems must incorporate the spatial transport of particles and their interactions, as well as changes to their copy numbers, all of which can be formulated in terms of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. The probabilistic representation of these processes is complex because of combinatorial aspects arising due to nonlinear interactions and varying particle numbers. This review presents the main field theory representations of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, which handle these issues `under-the-hood'. First, we focus on bringing techniques familiar to theoretical physicists -- such as second quantization, Fock space, and path integrals -- back into the classical domain of reaction-diffusion systems. We demonstrate how various field theory representations can all be unified under a single basis-independent representation. We then extend existing quantum-based methods and notation to work directly on the level of the unifying representation, and we illustrate how they can be used to consistently obtain previous known results, such as numerical discretizations and relations between model parameters at multiple scales. Throughout the work, we contextualize how these representations mirror well-known models of chemical physics depending on their spatial resolution, as well as the corresponding macroscopic limits. The framework presented here may find applications in a diverse set of scientific fields, including physical chemistry, theoretical ecology, epidemiology, game theory and socio-economical models of complex systems. The presentation is done in a self-contained educational and unifying manner such that it can be followed by researchers across several fields.

Title: Undulation-induced moiré superlattices with 1D polarization domains and 1D flat bands in 2D bilayer semiconductors
Authors: Xingfu Li, Sunny Gupta, Boris I. Yakobson
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have a high Föppl-von Kármán number and can be easily bent, much like a paper, making undulations a novel way to design distinct electronic phases. Through first-principles calculations, we reveal the formation of 1D polarization domains and 1D flat electronic bands by 1D bending modulation to a 2D bilayer semiconductor. Using 1D sinusoidal undulation of a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer as an example, we demonstrate how undulation induces nonuniform shear patterns, creating regions with unique local stacking and vertical polarization akin to sliding-induced ferroelectrics observed in twisted moiré systems. This sliding-induced polarization is also observed in double-wall BN nanotubes due to curvature differences between inner and outer tubes. Furthermore, undulation generates a shear-induced 1D moiré pattern that perturbs electronic states, confining them into 1D quantum-well-like bands with kinetic energy quenched in modulation direction while dispersive in other directions (1D flat bands). This electronic confinement is attributed to modulated shear deformation potential resulting from tangential polarization due to the moiré pattern. Thus, bending modulation and interlayer shear offer an alternative avenue, termed "curvytronics", to induce exotic phenomena in 2D bilayer materials.

Title: Observation of a Bilayer Superfluid with Interlayer Coherence
Authors: Erik Rydow, Vijay P. Singh, Abel Beregi, En Chang, Ludwig Mathey, Christopher J. Foot, Shinichi Sunami
Abstract: Controlling the coupling between different degrees of freedom in many-body systems is a powerful technique for engineering novel phases of matter. We create a bilayer system of two-dimensional (2D) ultracold Bose gases and demonstrate the controlled generation of bulk coherence through tunable interlayer Josephson coupling. We probe the resulting correlation properties of both phase modes of the bilayer system: the symmetric phase mode is studied via a noise-correlation method, while the antisymmetric phase fluctuations are directly captured by matter-wave interferometry. The measured correlation functions for both of these modes exhibit a crossover from short-range to quasi-long-range order above a coupling-dependent critical point, thus providing direct evidence of bilayer superfluidity mediated by interlayer coupling. We map out the phase diagram and interpret it with renormalization-group theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we elucidate the underlying mechanism through the observation of suppressed vortex excitations in the antisymmetric mode.

Title: Non-equilibrium dynamics of localization phase transition in the non-Hermitian Disorder-Aubry-André model
Authors: Yue-Mei Sun, Xin-Yu Wang, Liang-Jun Zhai
Abstract: The driven dynamics of localization transitions in a non-Hermitian Disordered Aubry-André (DAA) model are examined under both open boundary conditions (OBC) and periodic boundary conditions (PBC). Through an analysis of the static properties of observables, including the localization length ($\xi$), inverse participation ratio ($\rm IPR$), and energy gap ($\Delta E$), we found that the critical exponents examined under PBC are also applicable under OBC. The Kibble-Zurek scaling (KZS) for the driven dynamics in the non-Hermitian DAA systems is formulated and numerically verified for different local-to-local quench directions. The hybrid KZS (HKZS) in the overlapping critical region of non-Hermitian DAA and Anderson localization is proposed and numerically confirmed the validity across a local-to-skin quench direction. This study generalizes the application of the KZS to the dynamical localization transitions within systems featuring dual localization mechanisms.

Title: Prediction of high-Tc superconductivity in ternary actinium beryllium hydrides at low pressure

Abstract: Hydrogen-rich superconductors are promising candidates to achieve room-temperature superconductivity. However, the extreme pressures needed to stabilize these structures significantly limit their practical applications. An effective strategy to reduce the external pressure is to add a light element M that binds with H to form MHx units, acting as a chemical precompressor. We exemplify this idea by performing ab initio calculations of the Ac-Be-H phase diagram, proving that the metallization pressure of Ac-H binaries, for which critical temperatures as high as 200 K were predicted at 200 GPa, can be significantly reduced via beryllium incorporation. We identify three thermodynamically stable (AcBe2H10, AcBeH8, and AcBe2H14) and four metastable compounds (fcc AcBeH8, AcBeH10, AcBeH12 and AcBe2H16). All of them are superconductors. In particular, fcc AcBeH8 remains dynamically stable down to 10 GPa, where it exhibits a superconducting transition temperature Tc of 181 K. The Be-H bonds are responsible for the exceptional properties of these ternary compounds and allow them to remain dynamically stable close to ambient pressure. Our results suggest that high-Tc superconductivity in hydrides is achievable at low pressure and may stimulate experimental synthesis of ternary hydrides.

Title: Rainbow chains and numerical renormalisation group for accurate chiral conformal spectra
Authors: Attila Szabó
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.

Title: Optimal performance of thermoelectric devices with small external irreversibility
Authors: Rajeshree Chakraborty, Ramandeep S. Johal
Abstract: In the thermodynamic analysis of thermoelectric devices, typical irreversibilities are for the processes of finite-rate heat transfer, heat leak and Joule heating. Approximate analyses often focus on either internal or external irreversibility, obtaining well-known expressions for the efficiency at maximum power (EMP), such as the Curzon-Ahlborn value for endoreversible model and the Schmiedl-Seifert form for exoreversible model. Within the Constant Properties model, we simultaneously incorporate internal as well as external irreversibilities. We employ the approximation of a symmetric and small external irreversibility (SEI), allowing a tractable expression for EMP that depends on three parameters i) the ratio of internal to external thermal conductance ii) the figure of merit of the thermoelectric material and iii) the ratio of hot and cold reservoir temperatures. We study limiting forms of this EMP and compare our framework with the exact model as well as with other irreversible models in finite-time thermodynamics, such as the minimally nonlinear model. In particular, we argue that the TEG in endoreversible approximation can be mapped to the mesoscopic model of Feynman's ratchet in the high temperatures regime, thus providing an alternative to the viewpoint in literature where the TEG in linear regime is mapped to an exoreversible case. Finally, extending our study to the thermoelectric refrigerator under similar assumptions as for the generator, we analyze the efficiency at the maximum cooling power.

Title: Learning in a Multifield Coherent Ising Machine
Authors: Daan de Bos, Marc Serra-Garcia
Abstract: We introduce a network of coupled oscillators that can learn to solve a classification task from a set of examples -- performing both training and inference through the nonlinear evolution of the system. We accomplish this by combining three key elements to achieve learning: A long-term memory that stores learned responses, analogous to the synapses in biological brains; a short-term memory that stores the neural activations, similar to the firing patterns of neurons; and an evolution law that updates the synapses in response to novel examples, inspired by synaptic plasticity. Achieving all three elements in wave-based information processors such as metamaterials is a significant challenge. Here, we solve it by leveraging the material multistability to implement long-term memory, and harnessing symmetries and thermal noise to realize the learning rule. Our analysis reveals that the learning mechanism, although inspired by synaptic plasticity, also shares parallelisms with bacterial evolution strategies, where mutation rates increase in the presence of noxious stimuli.

Title: Atomistic mechanisms of viscosity in 2D liquid-like fluids
Authors: Dong Huang, Shaoyu Lu, Chen Liang, Matteo Baggioli, Yan Feng
Abstract: Shear viscosity plays a fundamental role in fluid dynamics from heavy-ion collisions to biological processes. Still, its microscopic mechanisms at the individual particle kinetic level remain a subject of ongoing research, specially in dense systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the shear viscosity ($\eta$) of two-dimensional (2D) simple fluids using computer simulations of Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, and one-component plasma systems. By combining Frenkel's liquid description, consisting of solid-like quasi-harmonic vibrations interrupted by thermally activated hops, with the concept of lifetime of local atomic connectivity $\tau_{LC}$, we find a surprisingly simple formula for the kinematic viscosity that is solely determined by $\tau_{LC}$ and the average kinetic particle speed $\bar{v}_p$. The derived analytical expression provides a direct link between macroscopic and microscopic dynamics, which shows excellent agreement with the simulation data in the dense liquid-like regime in all the 2D fluids considered. Moreover, it is discovered that, $\tau_{LC}$ in 2D fluids is universally determined by the effective potential difference between the first peak and valley of the pair correlation function, implying a direct connection between macroscopic shear transport and microscopic structure. Finally, we demonstrate that the characteristic length scale $l_p= \bar{v}_p \tau_{LC}$, which governs the macroscopic shear viscosity, aligns with the elastic length-scale that defines the propagation limit of collective shear waves in liquids. These findings establish that shear viscosity in 2D fluids arises from the diffusive transport of average particle momentum across the elastic length scale. Moreover, they highlight that shear dynamics are fundamentally governed by localized configurational excitations within the atomic connectivity network.

Title: Temperature Measurement via Time Crystal Frequencies in One-Dimensional Quantum Droplets
Authors: Saurab Das, Jagnyaseni Jogania, Jayanta Bera, Ajay Nath
Abstract: We propose a method for temperature measurement by analyzing the frequency of generated time crystals in one-dimensional (1D) quantum droplets. The system consists of a binary Bose-Einstein condensate mixture confined in a driven quasi-periodic optical lattice (QOL) with repulsive cubic effective mean-field and attractive quadratic beyond-mean-field interactions. By solving the 1D extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we derive the exact analytical wavefunction and investigate the droplet dynamics under different driving conditions. Specifically, we examine three cases: (i) constant driving frequency with linearly increasing QOL depth, (ii) constant QOL depth with linearly varying driving frequency, and (iii) constant driving frequency with sinusoidally modulated QOL depth. Fast Fourier Transform analysis reveals harmonic density oscillations, confirming time crystal formation. Additionally, we establish a non-trivial correlation between time crystal frequency and system temperature, demonstrating that an increase in time crystal frequency leads to oscillatory variations in the magnitude of the droplet's negative temperature. Finally, numerical stability analysis confirms that the obtained solutions remain robust, ensuring their feasibility for experimental realization.

Title: Canonical equilibrium of mean-field $O(n)$~models in the presence of random fields
Authors: Soumya Kanti Pal, Shamik Gupta
Abstract: We study canonical-equilibrium properties of Random Field $O(n)$ Models involving classical continuous vector spins of $n$ components with mean-field interactions and subject to disordered fields acting on individual spins. To this end, we employ two complementary approaches: the mean-field approximation, valid for any disorder distribution, and the replica trick, applicable when the disordered fields are sampled from a Gaussian distribution. On the basis of an exact analysis, we demonstrate that when replica symmetry holds, both the approaches yield identical expression for the free energy per spin of the system. As consequences, we study the case of $n=2$ ($XY$ spins) and that of $n=3$ (Heisenberg spins) for two representative choices of the disorder distribution, namely, a Gaussian and a symmetric bimodal distribution. For both $n=2$ and $n=3$, we demonstrate that while the magnetization exhibits a continuous phase transition as a function of temperature for the Gaussian case, the transition could be either continuous or first-order with an emergent tricriticality when the disorder distribution is bimodal. We also discuss in the context of our models the issue of self-averaging of extensive variables near the critical point of a continuous phase transition.

Title: Ionic-Bond-Driven Atom-Bridged Room-Temperature Cooper Pairing in Cuprates and Nickelates: a Theoretical Framework Supported by 32 Experimental Evidences
Authors: Jun-jie Shi, Yao-hui Zhu
Abstract: Unlike ordinary conductors and semiconductors, which conduct electricity through individual electrons, superconductors usually conduct electricity through pairs of electrons, known as Cooper pairs. Even after 4 decades of intense study, no one knows what holds electrons together in complex high-$T_c$ oxides. Here, targeting the critical challenge of the pairing mechanism behind high-$T_c$ superconductivity in cuprates and nickelates, we create a new theoretical framework by standing on the foundation of the chemical-bond$\rightarrow$structure$\rightarrow$property relationship. Considering the dominance of eV-scale ionic bonding, affinity of O$^-$ (1.46 eV) and O$^{2-}$ (-8.08 eV) and large second ionization energy ($\sim$10-20 eV) of metal atoms, we propose a groundbreaking idea of electron e$^-$ (hole h$^+$) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, i.e., the ionic-bond-driven $\mathbf{e^--O-e^-}$ ($\mathbf{h^+-M-h^+}$) itinerant Cooper pairing, by following the principle of "tracing electron footprints to explore pairing mechanisms". Its correctness and universality are confirmed by 32 diverse experimental evidences, especially, the STM topographic image combining with the small Cooper-pair size. Any other sub-eV and covalent-binding pairing mechanisms would be doubtful. Our findings resolve a 40-year puzzle of the microscopic mechanism for high-$T_c$ superconductivity and validate the feasibility of room-temperature carrier-pairing in ionic-bonded superconductors, bringing the dream of room-temperature superconductivity one step closer.

Title: Possible high thermoelectric power factor in alkali-metal-intercalated BC$_3$: anisotropic multiple valleys originating from the van Hove singularity of graphene
Authors: Ryutaro Enami, Kazuhiko Kuroki, Masayuki Ochi
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the electronic structure of monolayer BC$_3$ and find that it hosts anisotropic multiple valleys originating from the splitting of the van Hove singularity in graphene. To make use of its favorable electronic structure, we investigate the electronic structure of alkali-metal-intercalated BC$_3$, where intercalated atoms not only introduce electron carriers but also suppress interlayer coupling. We find that the interlayer transfer is effectively suppressed by potassium intercalation, by which the favorable electronic structure of monolayer BC$_3$ is preserved. Finally, we perform model calculation with the onsite-energy offset, and we verify that the strategy of introducing the splitting to the van Hove singularity works well.

Title: Effective two- and three-body interactions between dressed impurities in a tilted double-well potential
Authors: F. Theel, A. G. Volosniev, D. Diplaris, F. Brauneis, S. I. Mistakidis, P. Schmelcher
Abstract: We explore the impact and scaling of effective interactions between two and three impurity atoms, induced by a bosonic medium, on their density distributions. To facilitate the detection of mediated interactions, we propose a setup where impurities are trapped in a tilted double-well potential, while the medium is confined to a ring. The tilt of the potential breaks the spatial inversion symmetry allowing us to exploit the population of the energetically elevated well as a probe of induced interactions. For two impurities, the interaction with the medium reduces the impurity population at the energetically elevated well, which we interpret as evidence of induced impurity-impurity attraction. Furthermore, the impact of an induced three-body interaction is unveiled by comparing the predictions of an effective three-body model with many-body simulations. We extend our study for induced interactions to a three-component mixture containing distinguishable impurities. Our results suggest pathways to detect and tune induced two- and three-body interactions.

Title: Plasmons in N-layer systems
Authors: Taehun Kim, E. H. Hwang, Hongki Min
Abstract: In multilayer structures, the coupling between layers gives rise to unique plasmon modes, but analytic solutions are typically available only for bilayers due to the increasing complexity as the number of layers increases. We investigate plasmons in multilayer structures, including the effects of interlayer tunneling. By introducing the Coulomb eigenvector basis for multilayer systems, which can be solved exactly using Kac-Murdock-Szegő Toeplitz matrices, we analytically derive the long-wavelength plasmon dispersions both with and without interlayer tunneling. In the $N$-layer systems, we find that, in the absence of interlayer tunneling, the out-of-phase acoustic or charge neutral plasmon modes with linear dispersions ($\omega_\alpha\propto q/\sqrt{{1-\cos{\left(\frac{\alpha-1}{N}\pi\right)}}}$ for $\alpha = 2, 3, \cdots, N$) exist, while the in-phase classical plasmon mode exhibits its conventional dispersion ($\omega_1\propto \sqrt{q}$). When interlayer tunneling is present, the out-of-phase modes develop plasmon gaps that are governed by specific interband transitions, whereas the classical mode remains unaffected. These findings have broad applicability to general coupled-layer structures.

Title: Thermodynamic formulation of the spin magnetic octupole moment in bulk crystals
Authors: Jun Ōiké, Robert Peters, Koki Shinada
Abstract: The discovery of unconventional antiferromagnets, such as altermagnets, has drawn significant attention to higher-rank magnetic multipoles, particularly magnetic octupoles. Despite the advances in research, attempts to understand their microscopic properties remain limited due to the unbounded nature of the position operator in bulk crystals. In this paper, we address this problem by using a well-known thermodynamic approach and derive a formula for the spin magnetic octupole moment (SMOM) that can be used in bulk crystals. The resulting formula is gauge invariant and satisfies Středa formulas that relate the SMOM to the spin magnetoelectric dipole-quadrupole susceptibilities. Furthermore, we apply this formula to several models and examine the fundamental properties of the SMOM. For example, in $d$-wave altermagnets, the nonrelativistic component of the SMOM, which is independent of spin-orbit coupling, is larger than the relativistic component, which is induced by spin-orbit coupling. These nonrelativistic SMOMs have the same microscopic origin as the nonrelativistic spin splitting that characterizes $d$-wave altermagnetism. Moreover, they exhibit a Néel vector dependence consistent with Landau theory for $d$-wave altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{132}$, 176702 (2024)].

Title: X-ray-induced quenching of the $^{229}$Th clock isomer in CaF$_2$

Abstract: Thorium-229 has the lowest nuclear-excited state (an isomer state) at approximately 8.356 eV, making it excitable with tabletop vacuum-ultraviolet lasers. Despite the recent success of laser excitation, the isomer quenching inside the solid-state environment remains unresolved. In this letter, we present experiments investigating X-ray-induced isomer quenching in the CaF$_2$ host, focusing on the effects of X-ray flux and temperature on the lifetime and yield of the isomer state. Our studies reveal a correlation between isomer production, isomer lifetime during irradiation, and post-irradiation afterglow of the target crystal across different temperatures, highlighting a strong relationship between isomer quenching and color-center dynamics. We developed a model to interpret the isomer quenching and the crystal's luminescence.

Title: Atypical Ferrimagnetism in Ni$_4$Nb$_2$O$_9$
Authors: Jhuma Sannigrahi, Roumita Roy, Richard Waite, Anupam Banerjee, Mohamad Numan, Manh Duc Le, D. T. Adroja, Sudipta Kanungo, Subham Majumdar
Abstract: Ferrimagnetism typically emerges from chemically distinct magnetic ions or the same element at two inequivalent crystallographic sites, rendering unequal moments. In contrast, Ni4Nb2O9 has been recently discovered to show a different mechanism, where identical Ni2 ions with the same ligand coordination develop unequal magnetic moments purely due to differences in local environments. Here, we investigate the microscopic origin of this emergent mechanism through a synergy of powder neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering, and first principle based calculations. We demonstrate that the NiA and NiB sublattices, while sharing the same nominal valence, differ in their magnetic dimensionality NiA forms quasi one dimensional chains with enhanced p d hybridization and a reduced magnetic moment, whereas NiB retains a nearly two-dimensional geometry and a full S 1 moment. Our results underscore the pivotal role of spin dimensionality and local structural distortions in stabilizing ferrimagnetism in systems with electronically equivalent magnetic ions.

Title: Entanglement of Inhomogeneous Free Bosons and Orthogonal Polynomials
Authors: Pierre-Antoine Bernard, Rafael I. Nepomechie, Gilles Parez, Eric Ragoucy, David Raveh, Luc Vinet
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ground-state entanglement entropy in inhomogeneous free-boson models in one spatial dimension. We develop a powerful method to extract the leading term in the entanglement scaling, based on the analytic properties of the inhomogeneous potential. This method is applicable to a broad class of models with smooth spatial inhomogeneities. As a case study, we apply this approach for a family of exactly-solvable models characterized by orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme, finding a perfect match between the numerical and analytical results.

Title: How important is the dielectric constant in water modeling? Evaluation of the performance of the TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ force field and its compatibility with the Joung-Cheatham NaCl model
Authors: Łukasz Baran, Cosmin A. Dicu-Gohoreanu, Luis G. MacDowell
Abstract: Efficient large-scale computer simulations of aqueous solutions require the use of accurate but simple empirical force fields for water. However, the complexity of these systems evidences the difficulties in describing solution properties without due account of polarization. Different strategies to remedy this problem are parametrizing water force fields to the dielectric constant or charge scaling of solvated ions. In this work, we compare results from TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ and OPC models, which are parametrized to predict the dielectric constant, with results from TIP4P/2005, which is closer in spirit to the charge scaling strategy. The performance of the models is rated according to the Vega-Abascal benchmark. Our results show that TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ and TIP4P/2005 perform equally well, with the OPC model lying significantly behind. TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ can predict bulk phase properties (transport properties, thermal expansion coefficients, densities) of both liquid water and ice polymorphs, but also surface tensions, with an accuracy very similar to TIP4P/2005, while performing very well for dielectric constants over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. On the other hand, TIP4P/2005 provides a better description of phase boundaries, including liquid-vapor and freezing transitions. However, the accurate prediction of dielectric constants allows TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ to describe densities of NaCl solutions for models parametrized to their crystal and melt properties only. This is achieved without the need to rescale charges, modify the Lorentz-Berthelot rule or tune the ion's Lennard-Jones parameters. Our findings hinge on the significance of dielectric constants as a target property and show that a robust parametrization can be achieved without invoking the concept of charge scaling.

Title: Curvature induced modifications of chirality and magnetic configuration in perpendicular magnetized films
Authors: David Raftrey, Dhritiman Bhattacharya, Colin Langton, Bradley Fugetta, Subhashree Satapathy, Olha Bezsmertna, Andrea Sorrentino, Denys Makarov, Gen Yin, Peter Fischer, Kai Liu
Abstract: Designing curvature in three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nanostructures enables controlled manipulation of local energy landscapes, allowing for the modification of noncollinear spin textures relevant for next-generation spintronic devices. In this study, we experimentally investigate 3D magnetization textures in a Co/Pd multilayer film, exhibiting strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), deposited onto curved Cu nanowire meshes with diameters as small as 50nm and lengths of several microns. Utilizing magnetic soft X-ray nanotomography, we achieve reconstructions of 3D magnetic domain patterns at approximately 30nm spatial resolution. This approach provides detailed information on both the orientation and magnitude of magnetization within the film. Our results reveal that interfacial anisotropy in the Co/Pd multilayers drives the magnetization towards the local surface normal. In contrast to typical labyrinth domains observed in planar films, the presence of curved nanowires significantly alters the domain structure, with domains preferentially aligning along the nanowire axis in close proximity, while adopting random orientations farther away. We report direct experimental observation of a curvature-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which is quantified to be approximately one-third of the intrinsic DMI in Co/Pd stacks. The curvature induced DMI enhances stability of Neel-type domain walls. These experimental observations are further supported by micromagnetic simulations. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that introducing curvature into magnetic nanostructures provides a powerful strategy for tailoring complex magnetic behaviors, paving the way for the design of advanced 3D racetrack memory and neuromorphic computing devices.

Title: Light-induced Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs in unconventional magnets
Authors: Pei-Hao Fu, Sayan Mondal, Jun-Feng Liu, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: The recently predicted unconventional magnets offer a new ground for exploring the formation of nontrivial spin states due to their inherent nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. In this work, we consider unconventional magnets with $d$- and $p$-wave parities, and investigate the effect of time-periodic light drives for inducing the formation of spin-triplet phases in the normal and superconducting states. In particular, we consider unconventional magnets without and with conventional superconductivity under linearly and circularly polarized light drives and treat the time-dependent problem within Floquet formalism, which naturally unveils photon processes and Floquet bands determining the emergent phenomena. We demonstrate that the interplay between unconventional magnetism and light gives rise to a non-trivial light-matter coupling which governs the emergence of Floquet spin-triplet states with and without superconductivity that are absent otherwise. We find that photon-assisted processes promote the formation of spin-triplet densities and spin-triplet Cooper pairs between different Floquet sidebands. More precisely, the Floquet sidebands offer an additional quantum number, the Floquet index, which considerably broadens the classification of superconducting correlations that lead to Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs as an entirely dynamical phenomenon due to the interplay between light and unconventional magnetism. Furthermore, we discuss how the number of photons is connected to the symmetry of Cooper pairs and also explore how the distinct light drives can be used to manipulate them and probe the angular symmetry of unconventional magnets. Our results therefore unveil the potential of unconventional magnets for realizing nontrivial light-induced superconducting states.

Title: Thermoelectric Fingerprinting of Bloch- and Néel-type Skyrmions
Authors: Christopher E. A. Barker, Elias Saugar, Katharina Zeissler, Robert Puttock, Petr Klapetek, Olga Kazakova, Christopher H. Marrows, Oksana Chubykalo-Fesenko, Craig Barton
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale spin textures that exhibit topological stability, which, along with novel thermal and electrical transport properties, make them the ideal candidates for a variety of novel technological applications. Accessing the skyrmion spin texture at the nanoscale and understanding its interaction with local thermal gradients is essential for engineering skyrmion-based transport phenomena. However, direct experimental insight into the local thermoelectric response of single skyrmions remains limited. To address this, we employ scanning thermoelectric microscopy~(SThEM) to probe the nanoscale thermoelectric response from a single skyrmion. By mapping the local thermoelectric voltage with nanoscale precision, we reveal a unique spatially resolved response that is the convolution of the underlying spin texture of the skyrmion and its interaction with the highly localised thermal gradient originating from the heated probe. We combine this with thermoelectric modelling of a range of skyrmion spin textures to reveal unique thermoelectric responses and allow the possibility of SThEM to be used as a tool to distinguish nanoscale spin textures. These findings provide fundamental insights into the interaction of topologically protected spin textures with local thermal gradients and the resultant spin transport. We demonstrate a novel route to characterise nanoscale spin textures, accelerating the material optimisation cycle, while also opening the possibility to harness skyrmions for spin caloritronics.

Title: Radiation stability of nanocomposite scintillators
Authors: L. Prouzova Prochazkova, F. Hajek, M. Buryi, Z. Remes, V. Cuba
Abstract: Radiation hardness of scintillating nanocomposites consisting of inorganic scintillating nanocrystalline powders dispersed in organic matrices was studied under electron, X-ray and {\gamma}-ray irradiation. Samples including pure press-compacted pellets of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce, and the nanocomposites of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce embedded in polystyrene matrix with different fillings were investigated. Effects of radiation on radioluminescence and other optical properties of studied materials were evaluated. Bright burn effect related to nanocrystalline powder scintillators was observed at lower doses. Radiation damage in nanocomposite materials is related to the formation of radicals in polystyrene matrix. Extent of radiation damage decreases with ZnO:Ga filling. Presented results show the importance of systematic and complex study of the radiation stability of composite scintillators.

Title: Coexistence of anomalous spin dynamics and weak magnetic order in a chiral trillium lattice K2FeSn(PO4)3

Abstract: Trillium lattices, where magnetic ions form a three-dimensional chiral network of corner-sharing equilateral triangular motifs, offer a prominent platform to explore exotic quantum states. In this work, we report ground-state properties of the $S$ = 5/2 trillium lattice compound K$_{2}$FeSn(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$ through thermodynamic, electron spin resonance (ESR), and muon spin relaxation (${\mu}$SR) experiments. Thermodynamic and ESR measurements reveal the two-step evolution of magnetic correlations across $T^{*}$ = 11 K, which results from an interplay between dominant antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions and subleading interactions. Below $T^{*}$, \textit{dc} and \textit{ac} magnetic susceptibilities indicate weak \textcolor{black}{magnetic ordering} at $T_{\rm N} \approx 2$ K under low fields, which is suppressed for $\mu_{0}H \geq 2$ T, consistent with a power-law dependence of magnetic specific heat at low temperatures. $\mu$SR experiments confirm the dominance of persistent spin dynamics and the absence of conventional spin freezing, supporting the subtle nature of weak magnetic ordering coexisting with spin-liquid-like fluctuations. These findings underscore the potential for realizing a classical spin-liquid ground state with exotic excitations in high-spin trillium lattice systems.

Title: $1/f^{3/2}$ Power Spectrum at the Phonon Bottleneck
Authors: Steven T. Bramwell
Abstract: The common observation of a `$1/f^\alpha$' power spectrum with $\alpha<2$ constitutes one of the enduring mysteries of condensed matter physics. Here it is shown that a $1/f^{\alpha}$ power spectrum, with $\alpha = 3/2$, can arise when an ensemble of two--level systems is coupled to a heat bath by means of a system of Bosonic quasiparticles. The model considered is the classic model of Faughnan and Strandberg of the phonon bottleneck, and the anomalous relaxation is associated with an approximate non-equilibrium steady state of the phonons maintained by slow spin relaxation. It is shown that a frequency-dependent susceptibility can be defined in the steady state and that the prediction $\alpha=3/2$, or the equivalent stretched exponential relaxation with exponent $\beta = 2-\alpha = 1/2$, is consistent with existing experimental data. These results give an insight into the origins of anomalous relaxation in condensed matter and the practical behaviour of two-level systems.

Title: From weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the frustrated quantum spin-Peierls chain
Authors: Pyeongjae Park, Bo Xiao, Karolina Górnicka, Andrew F. May, Jiaqiang Yan, Ryoichi Kajimoto, Mitsutaka Nakamura, Matthew B. Stone, Gábor B. Halász, Andrew D. Christianson
Abstract: Fractionalized quasiparticles and their confinement into emergent bound states lie at the heart of modern quantum magnetism. While the evolution into magnonic bound states has been well characterized, experimental insight into the analogous transition to triplons remains limited. Here, using high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and state-of-the-art spin dynamics simulations, we uncover the transformation from weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the spin-Peierls compound CuGeO3. Quantitative comparisons between the measured spectra and tensor network simulations reveal substantial next-nearest-neighbor frustration and weak external dimerization, placing the system deep within the spontaneously dimerized regime and near the exactly solvable Majumdar-Ghosh point. We further show an energy- and temperature-dependent evolution between two contrasting quasiparticle regimes: deconfined spinons with markedly suppressed interactions by frustration, and coherent triplonic bound states with no observable spinon degrees of freedom. Remarkably, triplon character persists into the two-particle regime, forming a structured two-triplon continuum with a spectral feature associated with a van Hove singularity at its lower boundary. These findings challenge the conventional view that robust triplons require strong external dimerization and demonstrate how the interplay between frustration and dimerization can reshape fractionalization and confinement.

Title: Adjudicating Conduction Mechanisms in High Performance Carbon Nanotube Fibers

Abstract: The performance of carbon nanotube (CNT) cables, a contender for copper-wire replacement, is tied to its metallic and semi-conducting-like conductivity responses with temperature; the origin of the semi-conducting-like response however is an underappreciated incongruity in literature. With controlled aspect-ratio and doping-degree, over 61 unique cryogenic experiments including anisotropy and Hall measurements, CNT cable performance is explored at extreme temperatures (65 mK) and magnetic fields (60 T). A semi-conducting-like conductivity response with temperature becomes temperature-independent approaching absolute-zero, uniquely demonstrating the necessity of heterogeneous fluctuation induced tunneling; complete de-doping leads to localized hopping, contrasting graphite's pure metallic-like response. High-field magneto-resistance (including +22% longitudinal magneto-resistance near room-temperature) is analyzed with hopping and classical two-band models, both similarly yielding a parameter useful for conductor development. Varying field-orientation angle uncovers two-and four-fold symmetries from Aharonov-Bohm-like corrections to curvature-induced bandgap. Tight-binding calculations using Green's Function formalism model large-scale, coherent transport in commensurate CNT bundles in magnetic field, revealing non-uniform transmission across bundle cross-sections with doping restoring uniformity; independent of doping, transport in bundle-junction-bundle systems are predominantly from CNTs adjacent to the other bundle. The final impact is predicting the ultimate conductivity of heterogeneous CNT cables using temperature and field-dependent transport, surpassing conductivity of traditional metals.

Abstract: Quantum materials with bands of narrow bandwidth near the Fermi level represent a promising platform for exploring a diverse range of fascinating physical phenomena, as the high density of states within the small energy window often enables the emergence of many-body physics. On one hand, flat bands can arise from strong Coulomb interactions that localize atomic orbitals. On the other hand, quantum destructive interference can quench the electronic kinetic energy. Although both have a narrow bandwidth, the two types of flat bands should exhibit very distinct spectral properties arising from their distinctive origins. So far, the two types of flat bands have only been realized in very different material settings and chemical environments, preventing a direct comparison. Here, we report the observation of the two types of flat bands within the same material system--an above-room-temperature van der Waals ferromagnet, Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_2$, distinguishable by a switchable iron site order. The contrasting nature of the flat bands is also identified by the remarkably distinctive temperature-evolution of the spectral features, indicating that one arises from electron correlations in the Fe(1) site-disordered phase, while the other geometrical frustration in the Fe(1) site-ordered phase. Our results therefore provide a direct juxtaposition of the distinct formation mechanism of flat bands in quantum materials, and an avenue for understanding the distinctive roles flat bands play in the presence of magnetism, topology, and lattice geometrical frustration, utilizing sublattice ordering as a key control parameter.

Abstract: Aside from recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models, specialized AI hardware is crucial to address large volumes of unstructured and dynamic data. Hardware-based AI, built on conventional complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS)-technology, faces several critical challenges including scaling limitation of devices [1, 2], separation of computation and memory units [3] and most importantly, overall system energy efficiency [4]. While numerous materials with emergent functionalities have been proposed to overcome these limitations, scalability, reproducibility, and compatibility remain critical obstacles [5, 6]. Here, we demonstrate oxide-interface based polymorphic electronic devices with programmable transistor, memristor, and memcapacitor functionalities by manipulating the quasi-two-dimensional electron gas in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures [7, 8] using lateral gates. A circuit utilizing two polymorphic functionalities of transistor and memcapacitor exhibits nonlinearity and short-term memory, enabling implementation in physical reservoir computing. An integrated circuit incorporating transistor and memristor functionalities is utilized for the transition from short- to long-term synaptic plasticity and for logic operations, along with in-situ logic output storage. The same circuit with advanced reconfigurable synaptic logic operations presents high-level multi-input decision-making tasks, such as patient-monitoring in healthcare applications. Our findings pave the way for oxide-based monolithic integrated circuits in a scalable, silicon compatible, energy efficient single platform, advancing both the polymorphic and neuromorphic computings.

Title: On the origin of the Boltzmann distribution
Authors: Fedor Sandomirskiy, Omer Tamuz
Abstract: The family of Boltzmann distributions is used in statistical mechanics to describe the distribution of states in systems with a given temperature. We give a novel characterization of this family as the unique one satisfying independence for uncoupled systems. The theorem boils down to a statement about endomorphisms of the convolution semi-group of finitely supported probability measures on the natural numbers, or, alternatively, about endomorphisms of the multiplicative semi-group of polynomials with non-negative coefficients.

Title: Brain functions emerge as thermal equilibrium states of the connectome
Authors: Elkaïoum M. Moutuou, Habib Benali
Abstract: A fundamental idea in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are shaped and constrained by the brain's structural organization. Despite significant progress in mapping and analyzing structural connectomes, the principles linking the brain's physical architecture to its functional capabilities remain elusive. Here, we introduce an algebraic quantum model to bridge this theoretical gap, offering new insights into the relationship between the connectome and emergent brain functions, while connecting structural data to functional predictions. Using the well-mapped C. elegans anatomical and extrasynaptic connectomes, we demonstrate that brain functions, defined as functional networks of a neural system, emerge as thermal equilibrium states of an algebraic quantum system derived from the graph algebra of the underlying directed multigraph. Specifically, these equilibrium states, characterized by the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) formalism, reveal how individual neurons contribute to functional network formation. Our model illuminates the structure-function relationship in neural circuits through two key features: (1) a functional connectome that delineates topologically driven neuronal interactions and (2) an Integration Capacity (IC) index that quantifies how effectively neurons coordinate and modulate diverse information flows. Together, these features provide a statistical and mechanistic account of information flow and reveal how the network topology of the connectome predicts cognition and complex behaviors.

Title: Upsampling DINOv2 features for unsupervised vision tasks and weakly supervised materials segmentation
Authors: Ronan Docherty, Antonis Vamvakeros, Samuel J. Cooper
Abstract: The features of self-supervised vision transformers (ViTs) contain strong semantic and positional information relevant to downstream tasks like object localization and segmentation. Recent works combine these features with traditional methods like clustering, graph partitioning or region correlations to achieve impressive baselines without finetuning or training additional networks. We leverage upsampled features from ViT networks (e.g DINOv2) in two workflows: in a clustering based approach for object localization and segmentation, and paired with standard classifiers in weakly supervised materials segmentation. Both show strong performance on benchmarks, especially in weakly supervised segmentation where the ViT features capture complex relationships inaccessible to classical approaches. We expect the flexibility and generalizability of these features will both speed up and strengthen materials characterization, from segmentation to property-prediction.

Title: Distinctive features of inhomogeneous spin chains
Authors: Pierre-Antoine Bernard, Gilles Parez, Luc Vinet
Abstract: This review presents recent developments in the study of inhomogeneous XX spin chains, highlighting results on perfect state transfer, out-of-equilibrium stationary dynamics in open systems, and entanglement and correlations in ground states. We discuss the conditions on couplings that enable perfect state transfer, examine how heat currents scale when the chains are coupled to thermal baths, explore the role of tridiagonal matrices in approximating the entanglement Hamiltonian and investigate bulk and boundary entanglement negativity and correlation decay. These findings underscore some of the distinctive physical behavior of inhomogeneous spin chains and their potential applications in quantum information and thermal transport.

Title: Continuous majorization in quantum phase space for Wigner-positive states and proposals for Wigner-negative states
Authors: Jan de Boer, Giuseppe Di Giulio, Esko Keski-Vakkuri, Erik Tonni
Abstract: In quantum resource theory, one is often interested in identifying which states serve as the best resources for particular quantum tasks. If a relative comparison between quantum states can be made, this gives rise to a partial order, where states are ordered according to their suitability to act as a resource. In the literature, various different partial orders for a variety of quantum resources have been proposed. In discrete variable systems, vector majorization of Wigner functions in discrete phase space provides a natural partial order between quantum states. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum 7, 1021 (2023). In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general $N$-mode case. In addition, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. For the special case of the convex hull of $N$-mode Gaussian states, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour and Cerf. We also prove a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization.

Title: Foundation Neural-Networks Quantum States as a Unified Ansatz for Multiple Hamiltonians
Authors: Riccardo Rende, Luciano Loris Viteritti, Federico Becca, Antonello Scardicchio, Alessandro Laio, Giuseppe Carleo
Abstract: Foundation models are highly versatile neural-network architectures capable of processing different data types, such as text and images, and generalizing across various tasks like classification and generation. Inspired by this success, we propose Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States (FNQS) as an integrated paradigm for studying quantum many-body systems. FNQS leverage key principles of foundation models to define variational wave functions based on a single, versatile architecture that processes multimodal inputs, including spin configurations and Hamiltonian physical couplings. Unlike specialized architectures tailored for individual Hamiltonians, FNQS can generalize to physical Hamiltonians beyond those encountered during training, offering a unified framework adaptable to various quantum systems and tasks. FNQS enable the efficient estimation of quantities that are traditionally challenging or computationally intensive to calculate using conventional methods, particularly disorder-averaged observables. Furthermore, the fidelity susceptibility can be easily obtained to uncover quantum phase transitions without prior knowledge of order parameters. These pretrained models can be efficiently fine-tuned for specific quantum systems. The architectures trained in this paper are publicly available at this https URL, along with examples for implementing these neural networks in NetKet.

Title: Emergence of ecological structure and species rarity from fluctuating metabolic strategies
Authors: Davide Zanchetta, Deepak Gupta, Sofia Moschin, Samir Suweis, Amos Maritan, Sandro Azaele
Abstract: Ecosystems frequently display the coexistence of diverse species under resource competition, typically resulting in skewed distributions of rarity and abundance. A potential driver of such coexistence is environmental fluctuations that favor different species over time. How to include and treat such temporal variability in existing consumer-resource models is still an open problem. In this work, we study correlated temporal fluctuations in species' resource uptake rates -- i.e. metabolic strategies -- within a stochastic consumer-resource framework. In a biologically relevant regime, we are able to find analytically the species abundance distributions through the path integral formalism. Our results reveal that stochastic dynamic metabolic strategies induce community structures that align more closely with empirical ecological observations. Within this framework, ecological communities show a higher diversity than expected under static competitive scenarios. We find that all species become extinct when the ratio of the number of species to the number of resources exceeds a critical threshold. Conversely, diversity peaks at intermediate values of the same ratio. Furthermore, when metabolic strategies of different species are different on average, maximal biodiversity is achieved for intermediate values of the amplitude of fluctuations. This work establishes a robust theoretical framework for exploring how temporal dynamics and stochasticity drive biodiversity and community structure.

Title: A general formalism for machine-learning models based on multipolar-spherical harmonics
Authors: Michelangelo Domina, Stefano Sanvito
Abstract: The formulation of descriptors of the local chemical environment, enabling the construction of machine-learning models, is usually obtained by studying the properties of the expansion coefficients of a neighborhood density. In this work, we show that all the transformation properties of the descriptors and their behaviour under rotation, inversion and complex conjugation, are derived from the choice of the basis over which the density is expanded. Furthermore, crucially they are independent from the explicit mathematical form of the neighborhood density. In particular, we show that all the descriptors investigated, can be obtained by an expansion in multipolar spherical harmonics, which constitutes the core of this work, and which is introduced and analysed in great detail. By exploiting the orthogonality and the transformation rules of the multipolar spherical harmonics, we show that several formulations are simplified, such as the one needed to obtain the $\lambda-$SOAP kernel and its properties. We close this work by applying our framework to several multi-body descriptors available in literature, providing an in-depth analysis of their main properties, as made clear from the vantage viewpoint of a basis-centered approach.

Title: Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive
Authors: Raúl A. Briceño, William Gyory, Thomas Iadecola, Srimoyee Sen
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.

Title: A Generative Neural Annealer for Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization
Authors: Yuan-Hang Zhang, Massimiliano Di Ventra
Abstract: We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.

Title: Thermal transport characteristics of impinging ferrofluid droplets in the presence of a magnetic field
Authors: Ram Krishna Shah, Saptarshi Mandal
Abstract: Droplet interactions with solid surfaces are fundamental to natural phenomena and hold significant commercial relevance across diverse applications. While the impingement dynamics of conventional aqueous droplets on solid substrates are well-characterized, the behavior of non-aqueous droplets, particularly those influenced by external force fields like electric or magnetic fields, remains a less explored domain. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of a magnetic field on the impingement dynamics of ferrofluid droplets on a heated solid surface. Ferrofluids are unique colloidal suspensions of magnetic nanoparticles within a non-magnetic carrier fluid, enabling external manipulation of their dynamic properties through magnetic forces. The application of a magnetic field introduces an attractive force within the ferrofluid, fundamentally altering the droplet's spreading behavior and, consequently, its transport characteristics upon impact. Our findings reveal a substantial increase in both the maximum spreading diameter and the contact time between the droplet and the substrate, directly leading to enhanced thermal transport efficiency. Furthermore, the magnetic force effectively suppresses droplet bounce-off from hydrophobic surfaces. These critical parameters can be precisely controlled by adjusting the strength of the induced magnetic force. Such interactions can be used in the design of thermal switches and thermal management systems. The multi-physics interactions of magnetic fields, fluid flow, interface tracking, and heat transfer within the multiphase system are computationally modelled to examine the effect of Weber number and contact angle on maximum spreading and associated heat transfer characteristics.

Title: Fuzzy dark matter halos with repulsive self-interactions: coherent soliton and halo vortex network with moderate self-coupling
Authors: Milos Indjin, Nick Keepfer, I-Kang Liu, Nick P. Proukakis, Gerasimos Rigopoulos
Abstract: We examine the impact of repulsive self-interactions of moderate strength on fuzzy dark matter halos focusing on the core and granule size, the spatial dependence of the field's coherence, the turbulent vortex tangle and the oscillation frequency of the central soliton. Our analysis extends across the range from quantum-pressure-dominated to self-interaction-dominated stabilisation of the gravitationally bound solitonic core. Within this examined range of self-coupling strengths, we find that mergers with a given initial spatial configuration and an increasing self-interaction strength $g$, result in cores with increased size that exhibit a reduced central density and oscillate with decreased frequency. All of these features are in accordance with expectations from the study of isolated Self-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (SFDM) solitons. The characteristic size of the granules in the surrounding halo also grows but by a much smaller amount relative to the core; accordingly, typical inter-vortex distances are also only mildly affected. We also measure the total length of the vortex network which, although less robust, shows no clear dependence on increasing $g$ and no signs of decay over the timescales of our simulations. Measures of coherence of the field behave as in the non-interacting case, again clearly separating the coherent core form the quasi-coherent halo. Interestingly, we observe a relative increase of incoherent fluctuations coexisting with the coherent mode at the centre of the halo with increasing self-coupling strength, a phenomenon also observed in laboratory condensates at non-zero temperature.

Title: Probing Defects with Quantum Simulator Snapshots
Authors: Abhijat Sarma, Nayan Myerson-Jain, Yue Liu, Nandagopal Manoj, Jason Alicea, Roger G. Melko, Cenke Xu
Abstract: Snapshots, i.e. projective measurements of local degrees of freedom, are the most standard data taken in experiments on quantum simulators. Snapshots are usually used to probe local physics. In this work we propose a simple protocol to experimentally probe physics of defects with these snapshots. Our protocol relies only on snapshots from the bulk system, without introducing the defect explicitly; as such, the physics of different kinds of defects can be probed using the same dataset. In particular, we demonstrate that with snapshots of local spin configurations of, for example, the $1d$ Rydberg atom realization of the quantum Ising criticality, we can (1) extract the ``defect entropy", and (2) access the continuous line of fixed points of effective defect conformal field theory, which was recently discussed in the context of the ``weak-measurement altered criticality".

Title: Toda lattice formed in nonequilibrium steady states of SWCNT
Authors: Heeyuen Koh, Shigeo Maruyama
Abstract: Toda lattice or FPUT chain-like dynamics have been regarded as the prerequisite condition to explain the length dependency of high thermal conductivity of low-dimensional systems at the nanoscale. In this paper, a hypothetical condition is introduced that establishes a theoretical connection between the thermal conductivity of a nanoscale low-dimensional system in nonequilibrium steady states(NESS) and the canonical motion of the equation in the Toda lattice in equilibrium. The hypothesis relies on a numerically driven coarse grained molecular dynamics system acquired from the trajectory data of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics(NEMD) simulation. It models the macroscopic motion from longitudinal and flexural modulation observed in NEMD as a separate Hamiltonian in CGMD with a perturbation term governed by an overdamping process, which is assumed to be dominant during heat transfer. The Smoluchowski equation for the perturbation, which is derived from the cross correlated states between two degrees of freedom, suggests that the potential energy function induced from NESS is identical to that of Toda Lattice under the specific condition in the partition function for CG particles. The restrictions derived from the model are well confirmed by the data from the numerically driven CG model.

Title: Benchmarking a Tunable Quantum Neural Network on Trapped-Ion and Superconducting Hardware
Authors: Djamil Lakhdar-Hamina, Xingxin Liu, Richard Barney, Sarah H. Miller, Alaina M. Green, Norbert M. Linke, Victor Galitski
Abstract: We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing $a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter. We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum advantage.
