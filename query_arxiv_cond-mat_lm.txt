Title: Structural transition and possible pressure-induced superconductivity in a suboxide La$_5$Pb$_3$O
Authors: Jiaqiang Yan, David Singh, Bayram Saparov, Huibo Cao, Yejun Feng, Jinguang Cheng, Yoshia Uwatoko, David Mandrus
Abstract: Here we report a structural phase transition and its possible competition with superconductivity in the suboxide La$_5$Pb$_3$O. Upon cooling through $T_t$ = 225 K, La$_5$Pb$_3$O transforms from a high-temperature I4/mcm to a low-temperature P4/ncc structure in which La - Pb dimerization along the c-axis occurs. This transition is accompanied by anomalies in the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity and specific heat. High-pressure electrical transport measurements reveal that hydrostatic pressure suppresses the structural transition and possibly induces superconductivity with a maximum superconducting temperature of 10 K. Density functional theory calculations show minimal changes in the electronic density of states and no gap opening at $E_F$ across $T_t$, suggesting that the transition is driven by bonding effects rather than Fermi surface instability. These findings establish La$_5$Pb$_3$O as a promising platform for exploring the interplay between weak structural transitions and superconductivity.

Title: Emergent Interacting Phases in the Strong Coupling Limit of Twisted M-Valley Moiré Systems: Application to SnSe${}_2$
Authors: Ming-Rui Li, Dumitru Calugaru, Yi Jiang, Hanqi Pi, Ammon Fischer, Henning Schlömer, Lennart Klebl, Maia G. Vergniory, Dante M. Kennes, Siddharth A. Parameswaran, Hong Yao, B. Andrei Bernevig, Haoyu Hu
Abstract: We construct an interacting Wannier model for both AA-stacked and AB-stacked twisted SnSe2, revealing a rich landscape of correlated quantum phases. For the AA-stacked case, the system is effectively described by a three-orbital triangular lattice model, where each orbital corresponds to a valley and exhibits an approximate one-dimensional hopping structure due to a new momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetry. By exploring the interacting phase diagram using a combination of theoretical methods, including Hartree-Fock mean-field theory and exact solutions of the spin model in certain limits, we identify several exotic quantum phases. These include a dimerized phase with finite residual entropy, valence bond solids, and quantum paramagnetism. In the AB-stacked case, the system realizes an interacting kagome lattice model, where the Wannier orbitals associated with the three valleys form three sublattices. In the strong coupling regime, we use cluster mean-field methods to demonstrate the emergence of a classical spin liquid phase due to the frustrated lattice structure. The high tunability of the moiré system, which allows control over both the filling and interaction strength (via twist angle), renders twisted SnSe2 a versatile platform for realizing a wide range of exotic correlated quantum phases.

Title: Physical Principles of Size and Frequency Scaling of Active Cytoskeletal Spirals
Authors: Aman Soni, Shivani A. Yadav, Chaitanya A. Athale
Abstract: Cytoskeletal filaments transported by surface immobilized molecular motors with one end pinned to the surface have been observed to spiral in a myosin-driven actin 'gliding assay'. The radius of the spiral was shown to scale with motor density with an exponent of -1/3, while the frequency was theoretically predicted to scale with an exponent of 4/3. While both the spiraling radius and frequency depend on motor density, the theory assumed independence of filament length, and remained to be tested on cytoskeletal systems other than actin-myosin. Here, we reconstitute dynein-driven microtubule spiraling and compare experiments to theory and numerical simulations. We characterize the scaling laws of spiraling MTs and find the radius dependence on force density to be consistent with previous results. Frequency on the other hand scales with force density with an exponent of ~1/3, contrary to previous predictions. We also predict that the spiral radius scales proportionally and the frequency scales inversely with filament length, both with an exponent of ~1/3. A model of variable persistence length best explains the length dependence observed in experiments. Our findings that reconcile theory, simulations, and experiments improve our understanding of the role of cytoskeletal filament elasticity, mechanics of microtubule buckling and motor transport and the physical principles of active filaments.

Title: Predicting First-Passage Dynamics in Disordered Systems Exactly: Application to Sparse Networks
Authors: Daniel Marris, Chittaranjan Hens, Subrata Ghosh, Luca Giuggioli
Abstract: Quantifying how spatial disorder affects the movement of a diffusing particle or agent is fundamental to target search studies. When diffusion occurs on a network, that is on a highly disordered environment, we lack the mathematical tools to calculate exactly the temporal characteristics of search processes, instead relying on estimates provided by stochastic simulations. To close this knowledge gap we devise a general methodology to represent analytically the movement and search dynamics of a diffusing random walk on sparse graphs. We show its utility by uncovering the existence of a bi-modality regime in the time-dependence of the first-passage probability to hit a target node in a small-world network. By identifying the network features that give rise to the bi-modal regime, we challenge long-held beliefs on how the statistics of the so-called direct, intermediate, and indirect trajectories influence the shape of the resulting first-passage and first-absorption probabilities and the interpretation of their mean values. Overall these findings show that temporal features in first-passage studies can be utilised to unearth novel transport paradigms in spatially heterogeneous environments.

Title: Group theory method for extracting order parameters from scanning tunneling microscopy data
Authors: Julian Ingham, Yu-Xiao Jiang, M. Zahid Hasan, Harley D. Scammell
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a powerful local probe of correlated electronic states. Here we present a group theoretical framework for the analysis of STM data, filtering STM images into components which provide a real space mapping of the local symmetry properties of the underlying density of states. Using this formalism, we show that certain kinds of symmetry breaking are impossible to resolve in the first Brillouin zone, due to symmetry restrictions we term ``Bragg peak extinctions'' in analogy with related ideas in x-ray crystallography. We show extinct patterns of symmetry breaking can be resolved using sub-unit cell structure, and develop methodological details for the accurate extraction of this symmetry information. We illustrate our results on synthetic STM data for $2\times 2$ charge density waves on the kagome lattice, and on topographic data for kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. Our results provide a powerful method for extracting symmetry insights from STM data, and provide constraints on when and how certain ground states are experimentally observable.

Title: Run-and-tumble dynamics with non-reciprocal transitions between three velocity states
Authors: Julio C. R. Romo-Cruz, Francisco J. Sevilla
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of active particles undergoing a three-state run-and-tumble dynamics in one dimension, induced by non-reciprocal transition rates between self-propelling velocity states $\{-v, 0, +v\}$ that explicitly break microscopic reversibility. Departing from conventional reciprocal models, our formulation introduces a minimal yet rich framework for studying non-equilibrium transport driven by internal state asymmetries. Using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and analytical methods, we characterize the particle's transport properties across the transition-rates space. The model exhibits a variety of non-equilibrium behaviors, including ballistic transport, giant diffusion, and Gaussian or non-Gaussian transients, depending on the degree of asymmetry in the transition rates. We identify a manifold in transition-rate space where long-time diffusive behavior emerges despite the absence of microscopic reversibility. Exact expressions are obtained for the drift, effective diffusion coefficient, and moments of the position distribution. Our results establish how internal-state irreversibility governs macroscopic transport, providing a tractable framework to study non-equilibrium active motion beyond reciprocal dynamics.

Authors: Ray Yang, Junchi Chen, Douglas Thibodeaux, Robert B. Wexler
Abstract: We present this http URL, an extensible Julia-based platform for computational studies of phase equilibria at generic interfaces. The package supports a range of system configurations, from atomistic solid surfaces to coarse-grained lattice$-$gas models, with energies evaluated using classical interatomic potentials or lattice Hamiltonians. Both atomistic and lattice systems accommodate single- or multi-component mixtures with flexibly definable surface and lattice geometries. Implemented sampling algorithms include nested sampling, Wang$-$Landau sampling, Metropolis Monte Carlo, and, for tractable lattice systems, exact enumeration. Leveraging Julia's type hierarchies and multiple dispatch, this http URL provides a modular interface that allows seamless integration of system definitions, energy evaluators, and sampling schemes. Designed for flexibility, extensibility, and performance, this http URL offers a versatile framework for exploring the thermodynamics of interfacial phenomena.

Title: Spin and thermal current scaling at a $Y$-junction of XX spin chains
Authors: Domenico Giuliano, Francesco Buccheri
Abstract: We study the boundary phase diagram and the low-temperature heat and magnetization transport at a $Y$-junction of XX spin chains. Depending on the magnetization axis anisotropy between the magnetic exchange interactions at the junction, the system exhibits two different strong-coupling regimes at low energies/temperatures, similar to the overscreened (topological) four- and to the two-channel Kondo fixed points. Using renormalization group arguments combined with boundary conformal field theory methods, we show the instability of the former under any XY-type anisotropy at the junction. We analyze the low-temperature spin and the heat conductances. We find evidence of spin fractionalization of the elementary excitations at the four-channel Kondo fixed point by means of the magnetic Wiedemann-Franz law. We caution that the instability under XY anisotropy may hinder the detection of the phenomenology related to the four-channel Kondo effect, therefore requiring careful control in experimental realizations.

Title: Data-Driven Topological Analysis of Polymorphic Crystal Structures
Authors: Sourin Dey, Nicholas Miklaucic, Sadman Sadeed Omee, Rongzhi Dong, Lai Wei, Qinyang Li, Nihang Fu, Jianjun Hu
Abstract: Polymorphism, the ability of a compound to crystallize in multiple distinct structures, plays a vital role in determining the physical, chemical, and functional properties of materials. Accurate identification and prediction of polymorphic structures are critical for materials design, drug development, and device optimization, as unknown or overlooked polymorphs may lead to unexpected performance or stability issues. Despite its significance, predicting polymorphism directly from a chemical composition remains a challenging problem due to the complex interplay between molecular conformations, crystal packing, and symmetry constraints. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive data-driven analysis of polymorphic materials from the Materials Project database, uncovering key statistical patterns in their composition, space group distributions, and polyhedral building blocks. We discover that frequent polymorph pairs across space groups, such as (71, 225), display recurring topological motifs that persist across different compounds, highlighting topology not symmetry alone as a key factor in polymorphic recurrence. We reveal that many polymorphs exhibit consistent local polyhedral environments despite differences in their symmetry or packing. Additionally, by constructing polyhedron connectivity graphs and embedding their topology, we successfully cluster polymorphs and structurally similar materials even across different space groups, demonstrating that topological similarity serves as a powerful descriptor for polymorphic behavior. Our findings provide new insights into the structural characteristics of polymorphic materials and demonstrate the potential of data mining and machine learning for accelerating polymorph discovery and design.

Title: Atomistic Description of Spin Crossover Under Pressure and its Giant Barocaloric Effect
Authors: S. Vela, J. Ribas-Ariño, S.P. Vallone, A.M. dos Santos, M.A. Halcrow, K.G. Sandeman
Abstract: The pressure-dependent evolution of the spin crossover (SCO) transition has garnered significant interest due to its connection to the giant barocaloric effect (BCE) near room temperature. Pressure alters both the molecular and solid-state structures of SCO materials, affecting the relative stability of low- and high-spin states and, consequently, the transition temperature ($T_{1/2}$). Crucially, the shape of the $T_{1/2}$ vs. pressure curve dictates the magnitude of the BCE, making its accurate characterization essential for identifying high-performance materials. In this work, we investigate the nonlinear $T_{1/2}$ vs. pressure behavior of the prototypical SCO complex [FeL$_2$][BF$_4$]$_2$ [L = 2,6-di(pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine] using solid-state PBE+U computations. Our results unveil the mechanisms by which pressure influences its SCO transition, including the onset of a phase transition, as well as the key role of low-frequency phonons in the BCE. Furthermore, we establish a computational protocol for accurately modeling the BCE in SCO crystals, providing a powerful tool for the rapid and efficient discovery of new materials with enhanced barocaloric performance.

Title: Type-I Multiferroic VHfO$_4$ with Strain-Switchable Magnetic Orders and Magnetoelectric Coupling
Authors: Qisheng Yu, Boyu Liu, Hongjun Xiang, Shi Liu
Abstract: Motivated by the complementary properties of vanadium-based ferromagnets and HfO$_2$-based ferroelectrics, we propose a novel multiferroic oxide, VHfO$_4$, through 50\% Hf$^{4+}$ substitution with V$^{4+}$ in the ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ phase of HfO$_2$. First-principles DFT calculations reveal that the $Pca2_1$-like VHfO$_4$ phase exhibits dynamic stability and concurrent ferroic orders: robust ferroelectric polarization comparable to HfO$_2$ and V-driven magnetism. Parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations identify an antiferromagnetic ground state, while strain engineering enables tunable magnetoelectric coupling. Biaxial in-plane strain induces four magnetic states: intralayer FM/interlayer AFM, intralayer AFM/interlayer FM, spiral-like non-collinear order, and discrete alternating spin alignment. Critically, $c$-axis strain modulates magnetic energy landscapes, demonstrating electromechanical control of magnetism. This work establishes VHfO$_4$ as a Type-I multiferroic with coexisting atomic-scale ferroic origins and strain-tunable cross-coupling, offering a platform for voltage-controlled spintronics devices.

Title: EDIS: A Simulation Software for Dynamic Ion Intercalation/Deintercalation Processes in Electrode Materials
Authors: Liqi Wang, Ruijuan Xiao, Hong Li
Abstract: As the core determinant of lithium-ion battery performance, electrode materials play a crucial role in defining the battery's capacity, cycling stability, and durability. During charging and discharging, electrode materials undergo complex ion intercalation and deintercalation processes, accompanied by defect formation and structural evolution. However, the microscopic mechanisms underlying processes such as cation disordering, lattice oxygen loss, and stage structure formation phenomena are still not fully understood. To address these challenges, we have developed the Electrode Dynamic Ion Intercalation/Deintercalation Simulator (EDIS), a software platform designed to simulate the dynamic processes of ion intercalation and deintercalation in electrode materials. Leveraging high-precision machine learning potentials, EDIS can efficiently model structural evolution and lithium-ion diffusion behavior under various states of charge and discharge, achieving accuracy approaching that of quantum mechanical methods in relevant chemical spaces. The software supports quantitative analysis of how variations in lithium-ion concentration and distribution affect lithium-ion transport properties, enables evaluation of the impact of structural defects, and allows for tracking of both structural evolution and transport characteristics during continuous cycling. EDIS is versatile and can be extended to sodium-ion batteries and related systems. By enabling in-depth analysis of these microscopic processes, EDIS provides a robust theoretical tool for mechanistic studies and the rational design of high-performance electrode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries.

Title: Universal intrinsic orbital dynamics from Berry curvature in electronic two-band systems
Authors: Jongjun M. Lee
Abstract: The geometric structure of quantum states plays a fundamental role in determining the intrinsic dynamics of electrons in solids. In this work, we study the geometric origin of orbital angular momentum and its transport in a general two-band electronic system. Without assuming any symmetry or dimensional constraints, we show that the orbital Berry curvature, which governs the orbital Hall effect, can be universally expressed as the product of the band energy and the square of the Berry curvature. This highlights the central role of Berry curvature in engineering orbital Hall responses. We also discuss the applicability of our framework by analyzing a realistic model. Our findings underscore the geometric universality of itinerant intrinsic orbital dynamics.

Title: Memory effects of a static magnetic field on Brownian motion and the question of the absence of classical magnetism
Authors: Vladimir Lisy, Jan Busa, Jana Tothova
Abstract: The Bohr-van Leeuwen (BvL) theorem, stating the absence of classical magnetization in equilibrium, a fundamental result in the field of magnetic phenomena, was originally proved for an electron gas. In the present work, we deal with the problem of whether this theorem applies to particles undergoing a non-Markovian Brownian motion in a static magnetic field. We consider a charged Brownian particle (BP) immersed in a bath of neutral particles. Generalizing the Zwanzig-Caldeira-Legget theory to the presence of a static external magnetic field, we come to the equation of motion for the BP in the form of a generalized Langevin equation that accounts for memory effects in the dynamics of the system. By using its solutions for the displacement and velocity of the BP, we calculate the angular momentum for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck thermal noise. At long times, when the system should reach equilibrium, this momentum and, consequently, the classical magnetic moment of the BP are nonzero, in contrast to the BvL theorem. With the help of analytical and precise numerical calculations for different sets of system parameters, a simple formula for the angular momentum has been deduced.

Title: Colored Sandpile
Authors: S. S. Manna
Abstract: After the introduction of sandpile model a number of different variants have been studied. In most of these models sand particles are indistinguishable. Here we have painted the sand particles using a few distinct colors, and restrict them to move in linear trajectories only along their assigned lattice axes, one axis reserved for one color. Different colored particles interact among themselves through the toppling of unstable sand columns. Consequently, the avalanches or in general the self-organization processes in the sandpile has no overall preferred direction, though the individual particles execute directed motion. For such non-abelian colored sandpiles the steady states are found to be different and also the avalanche size distributions. This sandpile so defined has a non-trivial spatial structure and belongs to a different universality class of sandpile models. Dynamics of a granular heap with grains of different colors and properties may be described using this sandpile.

Title: Variational boundary based tensor network renormalization group
Authors: Feng-Feng Song, Naoki Kawashima
Abstract: We propose a real-space renormalization group algorithm for accurately coarse-graining two-dimensional tensor networks. The central innovation of our method lies in utilizing variational boundary tensors as a globally optimized environment for the entire system. Based on this optimized environment, we construct renormalization projectors that significantly enhance accuracy. By leveraging the canonical form of tensors, our algorithm maintains the same computational complexity as the original tensor renormalization group (TRG) method, yet achieves higher accuracy than existing approaches that do not incorporate entanglement filtering. Our work offers a practical pathway for extending TRG methods to higher dimensions while keeping computational costs manageable.

Title: Electronic localization on the structural inhomogeneities formed due to Bi and Te deficiency in the MBE grown films of AFM topological insulator MnBi2Te4: Evidence from spectroscopic ellipsometry and infrared studies
Authors: N. N. Kovaleva, D. Chvostova, T. N. Fursova, A. V. Muratov, S. I. Bozhko, Yu. A. Aleshchenko, A. Dejneka, D. V. Ishchenko, O. E. Tereshchenko, K. I. Kugel
Abstract: The intrinsic substitutional and antisite defects cause unintentional doping and shift of the E_F position above the conduction band minimum in the AFM topological insulator (TI) MnBi2Te4. This prevents measurements of the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAH) and investigation of the topological Dirac states. In the present study, the Mn-Bi-Te films grown by the MBE technique onto Si(111) substrates with decreasing Bi and Te contents and increasing Mn content were investigated by 0.5-6.5 eV spectroscopic ellipsometry. In addition, the 0.004-0.9 eV infrared (IR) transmittance spectra were examined. An effective medium model was used to reproduce the measured ellipsometric angles, Psi(omega) and Delta(omega), of the Mn-Bi-Te films in terms of the constructed model, including film thickness, surface roughness, and volume fractions of two (MnTe and Bi2Te3) or three constituents, the latter being associated with the structural inhomogeneities contribution. The results obtained for the inhomogeneous Mn-Bi-Te films using the three-phase EMA model indicate that the defect-associated optical response systematically shifts to higher photon energies from ~1.95 to ~2.43 eV with decreasing Te and Bi contents and increasing Mn content, pointing out that the electrons become more deeply localized in the formed structural inhomogeneities. The obtained results indicate that the structure of the non-stoichiometric Mn-Bi-Te films is not continuous but represented by regions of nearly stoichiometric MnBi2Te4 phase, which includes hollows or quantum anti-dots (QADs). The measured FIR transmittance spectra for the non-stoichiometric Mn-Bi-Te films show substantially reduced (or absent) contribution(s) from free charge carriers, which supports the relevance of localization effects.

Title: Edgetronics in 2D Altermagnet via Real-Space-Spin Coupling
Authors: Shibo Fang, Zongmeng Yang, Jianhua Wang, Xingyue Yang, Ching Hua Lee, Jing Lu, Xiaotian Wang, Yee Sin Ang
Abstract: The coupling between real-space coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states - energetically isolated within the bulk band gap - emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr2Se2O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the Neel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.

Title: Jamming of active particles in narrow pores: Implications for ratchet effect and diffusion coefficient
Authors: Šimon Pajger, František Slanina
Abstract: We study the behavior of colloidal active particles interacting via steric repulsion in various quasi-1D geometries. We mainly focus on active particles with high Péclet number. We discuss 3 phenomena closely tied to those systems: motility-induced phase separation (or dynamical freezing), ratchet effect (which takes place if the geometry has broken spatial symmetry), and the enhanced diffusion coefficient. We study those particles using numerical simulations employing an ASEP-like model. Besides direct numerical simulations we study the model by mean-field approximation and by solving the coarse-grained hydrodynamic equations.

Title: Fractal depth-first search paths in statistical physics models
Authors: Qiyuan Shi, Youjin Deng, Ming Li
Abstract: We study the fractal properties of depth-first search (DFS) paths in critical configurations of statistical physics models, including the two-dimensional $O(n)$ loop model for various $n$, and bond percolation in dimensions $d = 2$ to $6$. In the $O(n)$ loop model, the fractal dimension of the DFS path consistently matches that of the external perimeter, suggesting DFS as a convenient alternative for probing interface geometry. For bond percolation, the DFS path exhibits nontrivial fractal scaling across all studied dimensions, even in $d > 2$ where the external perimeter is not well defined. Interestingly, when DFS is applied to the full lattice without any dilution or criticality, the path is still fractal in two dimensions, with a dimension close to $7/4$, but becomes space-filling in higher dimensions. Our results demonstrate that DFS offers a robust and broadly applicable geometric probe for exploring critical phenomena beyond traditional observables.

Title: Superconductivity in imbalanced bilayer Hubbard model
Authors: Ziying Jia, Xun Liu, Mi Jiang
Abstract: We investigate the bilayer model with two layers of imbalanced densities coupled by the interlayer hybridization. Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal SC occurs at a moderate imbalance, whose SC is solely hosted by the layer with higher density (lower hole doping). Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. The uncovered SC hosted by a single layer is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.

Title: FastTrack: a fast method to evaluate mass transport in solid leveraging universal machine learning interatomic potential
Authors: Hanwen Kang, Tenglong Lu, Zhanbin Qi, Jiandong Guo, Sheng Meng, Miao Liu
Abstract: We introduce a rapid, accurate framework for computing atomic migration barriers in crystals by combining universal machine learning force fields (MLFFs) with 3D potential energy surface sampling and interpolation. Our method suppresses periodic self interactions via supercell expansion, builds a continuous PES from MLFF energies on a spatial grid, and extracts minimum energy pathways without predefined NEB images. Across twelve benchmark electrode and electrolyte materials including LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and LGPS our MLFF-derived barriers lie within tens of meV of DFT and experiment, while achieving ~10^2 x speedups over DFT-NEB. We benchmark GPTFF, CHGNet, and MACE, show that fine-tuning on PBE/PBE+U data further enhances accuracy, and provide an open-source package for high-throughput materials screening and interactive PES visualization.

Title: Measurement of the Unusual Dielectric Response to Low-Frequency s-Polarized Evanescent Waves in Metals with {\break} Implications for the Casimir Effect
Authors: M. Dhital, G. L. Klimchitskaya, V. M. Mostepanenko, U. Mohideen
Abstract: We report precision measurements of the lateral component of the oscillating magnetic field reflected from a copper plate, which is fully determined by s-polarized evanescent waves. The measurement data are compared with theoretical predictions of classical electrodynamics using the dielectric permittivity of copper as given by the Drude model. It is shown that these predictions are excluded by the measurement data which means that the currently used Drude model does not provide a complete description of the electromagnetic response of metals for s-polarized evanescent waves. The critical importance of this result for several fields of condensed matter physics and optics dealing with evanescent waves, including the Casimir effect, is discussed.

Title: Unraveling energy flow mechanisms in semiconductors by ultrafast spectroscopy: Germanium as a case study
Authors: Grazia Raciti, Begoña Abad, Riccardo Dettori, Raja Sen, Aswathi K. Sivan, Jose M. Sojo-Gordillo, Nathalie Vast, Riccardo Rurali, Claudio Melis, Jelena Sjakste, Ilaria Zardo
Abstract: Semiconductor materials are the foundation of modern electronics, and their functionality is dictated by the interactions between fundamental excitations occurring on (sub-)picosecond timescales. Using time-resolved Raman spectroscopy and transient reflectivity measurements, we shed light on the ultrafast dynamics in germanium. We observe an increase in the optical phonon temperature in the first few picoseconds, driven by the energy transfer from photoexcited holes, and the subsequent decay into acoustic phonons through anharmonic coupling. Moreover, the temperature, Raman frequency, and linewidth of this phonon mode show strikingly different decay dynamics. This difference was ascribed to the local thermal strain generated by the ultrafast excitation. We also observe Brillouin oscillations, given by a strain pulse traveling through germanium, whose damping is correlated to the optical phonon mode. These findings, supported by density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, provide a better understanding of the energy dissipation mechanisms in semiconductors.

Title: Phonon anomalies, Anharmonicity, and thermal expansion coefficient in few layered PtX2 (X= S, Se): A temperature dependent Raman study
Authors: Atul G. Chakkar, Chaitanya B. Auti, Gaurav Bassi, Mukesh Kumar, Pradeep Kumar
Abstract: Two-dimensional group-10 noble transition metal dichalcogenides have garnered growing attention due to their rich physical properties and promising applications across nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and spintronics. Among them, PtX2 (X = S, Se) exhibits pronounced interlayer coupling driven by hybridization of the out-of-plane Pz orbitals of the chalcogen atoms. In this work, we present a detailed temperature and polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopic study of few-layer PtS2 and PtSe2 over the temperature range of ~ 5 to 300 K. Our study encompasses phonon-phonon interactions, symmetry analysis of phonon modes, low-frequency interlayer vibrations, and extraction of thermal expansion coefficients. Notable phonon anomalies in peak position, linewidth, and intensity emerge around ~ 80 K and 150 K for PtS2, and ~ 70 K and 240 K for PtSe2, indicating intricate coupling between thermal and vibrational dynamics. These results offer valuable insights for the development of devices based on PtS2, PtSe2, and related 2D materials, where interlayer interactions, anharmonic effects, and thermal expansion behaviour play crucial roles.

Title: Periodic transitions of topological charge in skyrmions confined within FeGe and Co/Pt nanodisks
Authors: R. L. Silva, R. C. Silva
Abstract: The dynamic control of skyrmion properties such as polarity, vorticity, and topological charge is crucial for their implementation in spintronic applications. In this work, we investigate the periodic inversion of the topological charge in two distinct systems: FeGe, a bulk chiral magnet, and Co/Pt, an interfacial system with strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. By applying an oscillating magnetic field perpendicular to the film plane, we induce cyclic transitions in the spin texture. In FeGe, the skyrmion evolves through a $Q=1 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow -1$ sequence via an intermediate skyrmionium state. In Co/Pt, the process involves skyrmion annihilation and re-nucleation, resulting in alternating topological charges. These results reveal distinct dynamic mechanisms for topological charge modulation, offering potential pathways for the energy-efficient control of skyrmion-based devices.

Title: Phase transitions and dynamics of one-dimensional solitons in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Bose mixtures
Authors: Gui-hua Chen, Hongcheng Wang, Boris A. Malomed, Haiming Deng, Yongyao Li
Abstract: We investigate the formation, stability, and dynamics of solitons in a one-dimensional binary Bose-Einstein condensate under the action of the spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) and Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction to the underlying system of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations. We identify the semi-dipole (SD) family of solitons and thoroughly analyze its properties. The numerical analysis reveals intricate bifurcations, including transitions from real to complex-valued stationary wavefunctions of the SD solitons and norm-dependent dynamical instabilities. Stability maps in the plane of the solitons' norm and interaction strength exhibit areas of monostability, oscillatory behavior, and soliton splitting. Solitons with complex stationary wavefunctions emerge as ground states in broad parameter areas, due to the effects of the LHY terms. The other soliton species, in the form of mixed modes (MMs), does not feature the compexification bifurcation. In the LHY-dominated regime, the SD and MM solitons exhibit identical values of the energy for the same norm. The results deepen the understanding of nonlinear matter-wave states and reveal multi-stable ones in quantum gases.

Title: Field-induced condensation of $π$ to 2$π$ soliton lattices in chiral magnets

Abstract: Chiral soliton lattices (CSLs) are nontrivial spin textures that emerge from the competition between Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, anisotropy, and magnetic fields. While well established in monoaxial helimagnets, their role in materials with anisotropic, direction-dependent chirality remains poorly understood. Here, we report the direct observation of a tunable transition from $\pi$ to 2$\pi$ soliton lattices in the non-centrosymmetric Heusler compound Mn1.4PtSn. Using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, resonant elastic X-ray scattering, and micromagnetic simulations, we identify a $\pi$-CSL as the magnetic ground state, in contrast to the expected helical phase, which evolves into a classical 2$\pi$-CSL under increasing out-of-plane magnetic fields. This transition is governed by a delicate interplay between uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetostatic interactions, as captured by a double sine-Gordon model. Our analysis not only reveals the microscopic mechanisms stabilizing these soliton lattices but also demonstrates their general relevance to materials with D2d, S4, Cnv, or Cn symmetries. The results establish a broadly applicable framework for understanding magnetic phase diagrams in chiral systems, with implications for soliton-based spintronic devices and topological transport phenomena.

Title: Moment closure through spectral expansion in open stochastic systems
Authors: Gianni Valerio Vinci, Roberto Benzi, Maurizio Mattia
Abstract: The derivation of dynamical laws for general observables (or moments) from the master equation for the probability distribution remains a challenging problem in statistical physics. Here, we present an alternative formulation of the general spectral expansion, which clarifies the connection between the relaxation dynamics of arbitrary moments and the intrinsic time scales of the system. Within this framework, we address the moment-closure problem in a way that streamline the conventional treatment of open systems. The effectiveness of the theory is illustrated by deriving analytical expressions for two representative cases: spectral amplification in stochastic resonance and the moment dynamics of a non-Gaussian system, namely the Bessel process with constant drift. We also identify a direct relationship between our theory and the Koopman operator approach. Finally, we apply our approach to the nonlinear and out-of-equilibrium mean-field description of interacting excitatory and inhibitory populations.

Title: Crystalline electric field excitations in Weyl semimetal \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = Ce, Pr and Nd)
Authors: Lin Yang, Yili Sun, Xiutong Deng, Weizheng Cao, Xiaoyan Ma, Yinguo Xiao, Zhentao Wang, Ze Hu, Xiaowen Hao, Yuan Yuan, Zecong Qin, Wei Luo, Qingyong Ren, Xin Tong, Mohamed Aouane, Manh Duc Le, Youguo Shi, Yanpeng Qi, Devashibhai Adroja, Huiqian Luo
Abstract: The rare earth intermetallic system \textit{R}Al\textit{X} (\textit{R} = rare earth elements, \textit{X} = Si and Ge) is known to be a promising candidate of magnetic Weyl semimetal. Due to the complex interactions between the rare earth elements and surrounding atoms, as well as hybridization with itinerant electrons, this family likely possesses highly intriguing and novel magnetic structures and thus exhibits dynamic behaviors. We systematically probe polycrystalline samples of \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = La, Ce, Pr and Nd) combining inelastic neutron scattering (INS), heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The INS measurements identify well-resolved crystalline electric field (CEF) excitations at 19.2 and 24.9 meV in CeAlSi, at 5.4 meV in PrAlSi, and at 2.5 and 4.2 meV in NdAlSi. We analyzed the INS data using the corresponding CEF models and determined the CEF parameters and ground state wave functions of \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = Ce, Pr and Nd). Our results suggest strong single-ion anisotropy in their ground states: $|\pm3/2\rangle$ (94.5\%) in CeAlSi, $|\pm3\rangle$ (99.2\%) in PrAlSi, and $|\pm9/2\rangle$ (76.2\%) in NdAlSi. Notably, the weaker anisotropy and strong exchange interactions in NdAlSi promote competing magnetic orders and CEF splitting at low temperature, contrasting with the robust CEF levels in magnetic states of CeAlSi and PrAlSi.

Title: The 6H-Perovskite Dimer Lattice with Antiferromagnetic Interactions: Ba$_3$ARu$_2$O$_9$
Authors: Daniel M. Pajerowski, David A. Dahlbom, Daniel Phelan, Yu Li, Alexander I. Kolesnikov
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic behavior of the 6H-perovskite dimer lattice Ba$_3$Zn$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$Ru$_2$O$_9$ using analytical theory, density functional theory, inelastic neutron scattering, and modeling of historical magnetization and neutron-scattering data. A dimer mean-field theory built upon classical Luttinger-Tisza analysis generates a phase diagram revealing a transition from a nonmagnetic singlet to a finite-moment ground state as interdimer couplings increase. A (generalized) linear spin-wave theory captures multiplet mixing, excitation gap closing, and fluctuation-induced moment suppression. Density functional theory on select compounds and neutron spectroscopy on dilute Ba$_3$Zn(Ru$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$O$_9$ confirm the exchange hierarchy, enabling quantification of previously published experiments within this framework. Our results identify three mechanisms for magnetic moment suppression: quantum fluctuations, ligand hybridization, and nonmagnetic-singlet/magnetic-multiplet mixing.

Title: Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps
Authors: Molly Brennan, Edwina F. Yeo, Philip Pearce, Mohit P. Dalwadi
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.

Title: Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Graphene Electronic Band Structure Prediction
Authors: Wei Shan Lee, I Hang Kwok, Kam Ian Leong, Chi Kiu Althina Chau, Kei Chon Sio
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic band structures in two-dimensional materials remains a fundamental challenge, with existing methods struggling to balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy. We present the Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Network (SCMS-PINN) v35, which directly learns graphene band structures while rigorously enforcing crystallographic symmetries through a multi-head architecture. Our approach introduces three specialized ResNet-6 pathways -- K-head for Dirac physics, M-head for saddle points, and General head for smooth interpolation -- operating on 31 physics-informed features extracted from k-points. Progressive Dirac constraint scheduling systematically increases the weight parameter from 5.0 to 25.0, enabling hierarchical learning from global topology to local critical physics. Training on 10,000 k-points over 300 epochs achieves 99.99\% reduction in training loss (34.597 to 0.003) with validation loss of 0.0085. The model predicts Dirac point gaps within 30.3 $\mu$eV of theoretical zero and achieves average errors of 53.9 meV (valence) and 40.5 meV (conduction) across the Brillouin zone. All twelve C$_{6v}$ operations are enforced through systematic averaging, guaranteeing exact symmetry preservation. This framework establishes a foundation for extending physics-informed learning to broader two-dimensional materials for accelerated discovery.

Title: Edge Reconstruction in a Quantum Spin Hall Insulator
Authors: Rahul Soni, Matthias Thamm, Gonzalo Alvarez, Bernd Rosenow, Adrian Del Maestro
Abstract: We study interaction-driven edge reconstruction in a quantum spin Hall insulator described by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model with Kanamori-Hubbard interactions using the real-space density matrix renormalization group method in both the grand-canonical and canonical ensembles. For a two-dimensional cylinder with a smooth edge, we identify discrete particle-number transitions that lead to a spin-polarized edge state stabilized by an emergent ferromagnetic exchange interaction. The reconstruction is orbital-selective, occurring predominantly in the $s$-orbital channel. Our results reveal a fully microscopic mechanism for emergent spin polarization at the edge that could compromise the topological protection of helical edge states by time reversal symmetry.

Title: Machine-Learning-enabled ab initio study of quantum phase transitions in SrTiO$_3$
Authors: (1)Jonathan Schmidt,  (1)Nicola A. Spaldin ((1) Department of Materials, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland)
Abstract: We use the self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) with machine learning interatomic potentials to calculate the effect of $^{18}$O substitution on the properties of quantum paraelectric SrTiO$_3$ (STO). We find that calculations including both quantum and anharmonic effects are able to reproduce the experimentally observed isotope effect, in which replacement of $^{16}$O by $^{18}$O induces the ferroelectric state, and demonstrate that the ferroelectric phase transition in ST$^{18}$O can be reproduced in a purely displacive manner. We calculate the ferroelectric soft mode frequency as a function of volume, lattice parameters and temperature for ST$^{16}$O and ST$^{18}$O, and find that the phase space in which ST$^{16}$O shows quantum paraelectric behaviour, while ST$^{18}$O becomes ferroelectric is narrow. Our study shows that machine learning interatomic potentials enable temperature-dependent simulations that include quantum and anharmonic phonon effects, however quantitative prediction of phase diagrams remains challenging due to a lack of universally accurate electronic structure methods.

Title: Reconfiguration of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction as a Way to Turn It into a Field-Free Vortex Oscillator
Authors: Maksim Stebliy, Alex Jenkins, Luana Benetti, Ricardo Ferreira
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are key elements in practical spintronics, enabling not only conventional tasks such as data storage, transmission, and processing but also the implementation of compute-in-memory processing elements, facilitating the development of efficient hardware for neuromorphic computing. The functionality of an MTJ is determined by the properties of its free layer (FL) and reference layer (RL) with fixed magnetization, separated by an MgO tunnel barrier. This paper presents a mechanism for reconfiguring the RL, which is the upper layer of a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet, enabling a reversible transition from a single-domain state to a vortex magnetic state with different core positions. When the RL is in the vortex state, it generates a spin current with a vortex-like polarization distribution, enabling stable vortex oscillations in the FL even in the absence of external magnetic fields. This effect has been confirmed in MTJs with diameters ranging from 400 to 1000 nm. It is demonstrated, using experimental data with comparative micromagnetic simulation, that the pinning antiferromagnet retains a long term memory of previous reannealing states resulting in a deformation of the vortex polarised spin current, which in turn introduces a strong dynamical vortex core polarity symmetry breaking. The analogue reprogrammable nature of both the static and dynamic properties of the MTJ demonstrate different possible routes for the introduction of non-volatility into radiofrequency spintronic neuromorphic paradigms.

Title: Formation and protection of an Eu-Ir surface compound below hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Alaa Mohammed Idris Bakhit, Khadiza Ali, Frederik Schiller
Abstract: Europium (Eu) intercalation below hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) on an Ir(111) substrate at various Eu coverages is investigated. The structural and electronic properties were examined using low energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Depending on the deposition temperature, different superstructures, (5 $\times$ $M$), (5 $\times$ 2), and ($ \sqrt{3}$ $\times$ $\sqrt{3})R30^{\circ}$ with respect to the Ir substrate were identified by LEED. The (5 $\times$ $M$) superstructure ($M$ $>$ 2), at 0.1 monolayer (ML), preserved the hBN/Ir Moir{é} pattern and exhibited a unidirectional ordering of Eu atoms. At higher coverage of 0.26 ML, a (5 $\times$ 2) superstructure emerged, where excess Eu atoms diffused into the bulk and were analyzed as Eu in a tri-valent state. At the highest preparation temperature with a one-third ML Eu, the formation of a ($\sqrt{3}$ $\times$ $\sqrt{3})R30^{\circ}$ superstructure indicates the presence of a EuIr$_{2}$ surface alloy beneath the hBN layer, with di-valent Eu atoms suggesting potential ferromagnetic properties. Air exposure was used to evaluate the protection of the hBN layer, and the results indicate that the EuIr$_{2}$ surface alloy was partially protected. However, the hBN layer remained intact by intercalation and air exposure, as confirmed by ARPES analysis.

Title: Collision of surfactant-laden droplets: insights from molecular dynamics simulation
Authors: Soheil Arbabi, Piotr Deuar, Rachid Bennacer, Zhizhao Che, Panagiotis E. Theodorakis
Abstract: We study the collision dynamics of surfactant-laden droplets and compare it with that of pure water droplets, with a focus on the bridge growth rate, energy balance, and disk dynamics, distinguishing the cases of head-on and off-centre collisions. By using molecular dynamics simulation of a coarse-grained model, it is found that initial linear scaling describes the first stage of the collision process, which is followed by power-law dynamics, in contrast to an initial thermal regime and a subsequent power-law behaviour observed for droplet coalescence. The transition between the two regimes occurs faster for surfactant-laden droplets. At higher collision velocities, the linear regime dominates the process with a gradual reduction of the power-law behaviour, reaching a situation in which the bridge growth is fully characterised by linear dynamics. The different behaviour of the droplets is presented in the form of a diagram of different scenarios, namely coalescence, separation, and splattering. In particular, it is found that higher velocities and larger offsets increase the likelihood of separation and splattering, with water droplets producing a greater number of satellite droplets due to reduced viscous damping. Also, a disk-like structure is observed as a result of collision, but it is less pronounced in the case of surfactant-laden droplets, due to higher dissipation of energy.

Title: Reinforcement-Learning-Designed Field-Free Sub-Nanosecond Spin-Orbit-Torque Switching
Authors: Yuta Igarashi, Junji Fujimoto
Abstract: We demonstrate deterministic, field-free magnetization reversal of a single-domain nanomagnet within 300 ps under a current density of $3 \times 10^{10}~\mathrm{A/m^2}$ by coupling reinforcement learning (RL) to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with the spin-orbit torques (SOTs). The RL agent autonomously discovers a current waveform that minimizes the magnetization trajectory path and exploits a precessional shortcut enabled by the field-like SOT and hard-axis anisotropy. From the learned pulse, we extract a clear physical picture of the dynamics and develop a model-based analytical framework that establishes a lower bound on the switching time. The control strategy remains robust across a wide range of damping constants and is stabilized against thermal fluctuations at higher current densities. We also discuss feasible experimental implementations for the precessional switching.

Title: Snap-through time of arches is controlled by slenderness and imperfections
Authors: William Simpkins, Matthew G. Hennessy, Matteo Taffetani
Abstract: Snap-through occurs in elastic structures when a stable equilibrium configuration becomes unstable, resulting in rapid motion towards a new and distinct stable state. While static analyses of snap-through are well documented, the dynamics of snap-through remain under-explored, particularly in structures with natural curvature. Using a combination of finite element simulations and multiple-scales analysis, we show that the snap-through dynamics of an arch under a central point load are controlled by its slenderness and imperfections embedded in the system. As the slenderness increases, the snap-through dynamics slow down, and the mode of snap-through changes from limit-point buckling to bifurcation buckling. When bifurcation buckling occurs, snap-through is preceded by an extended period of oscillatory behaviour. The duration of these pre-snap-through oscillations, and hence the snap-through time, is entirely controlled by imperfections in the system. Increasing the strength of imperfections dramatically reduces the snap-through time. Analytical expressions for the snap-through times are presented for limit point and bifurcation buckling. Our work suggests that natural curvature and deliberately introduced imperfections can be used to tune the snap-through dynamics of new functional materials.

Title: Ion-Specific Effects at the Surface of Water
Authors: Sanghamitra Sengupta, Jan Versluis, Huib J. Bakker
Abstract: We studied the interaction between salts and surfactants on the water surface using heterodyne-detected vibrational sum frequency generation (HD-VSFG) spectroscopy. We used sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a prototype surfactant system at 75 micromolar bulk concentration in water. The vibrational response of the OH band of near-surface oriented water molecules and the CH bands of the hydrophobic tails of the surfactant are measured. We observed a dramatic enhancement of the surface density of the negatively charged SDS (DS-) within a narrow range of added salt concentrations. We demonstrated this increase is strongly ion-specific, and induced by the screening of the lateral Coulomb repulsion of the sulfate headgroups by the added cations, followed by strong hydrophobic interactions (hydrophobic collapse) when the DS- surface density reaches a critical value. For a solution of 75 micromolar SDS, the required concentrations of CsCl, KCl, and NaCl for this transition are 2, 5, and 10 mM, respectively.

Title: Unified Theory of Dark Count Rate and System Detection Efficiency for NbN, WSi Based Superconducting Single Photon Detectors
Authors: Daien He, Leif Bauer, Sathwik Bharadwaj, Zubin Jacob
Abstract: Predicting the behavior of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) is important as their use becomes more widespread in fields ranging from quantum computing to quantum remote sensing. Here, we present a vortex crossing theory of photon detection which provides a unified definition of system detection efficiency and dark count rates. Our approach quantitatively captures the plateau region of system detection efficiency for NbN and WSi based SNSPDs. We concurrently predict the temperature dependence of dark count rates and the intrinsic timing jitter of SNSPDs. We extensively benchmark our model against various experiments to aid in the design of the next generation of SNSPDs.

Title: Concentration-Free Quantum Kernel Learning in the Rydberg Blockade
Authors: Ayana Sarkar, Martin Schnee, Roya Radgohar, Mojde Fadaie, Victor Drouin-Touchette, Stefanos Kourtis
Abstract: Quantum kernel methods (QKMs) offer an appealing framework for machine learning on near-term quantum computers. However, QKMs generically suffer from exponential concentration, requiring an exponential number of measurements to resolve the kernel values, with the exception of trivial (i.e., classically simulable) kernels. Here we propose a QKM that is free of exponential concentration, yet remains hard to simulate classically. Our QKM utilizes the weak ergodicity-breaking many-body dynamics in the Rydberg blockade of coherently driven neutral atom arrays. We demonstrate the fundamental properties of our QKM by analytically solving an approximate toy model of its underpinning quantum dynamics, as well as by extensive numerical simulations on randomly generated datasets. We further show that the proposed kernel exhibits effective learning on real data. The proposed QKM can be implemented in current neutral atom quantum computers.

Title: Gauging the variational optimization of projected entangled-pair states
Authors: Wei Tang, Laurens Vanderstraeten, Jutho Haegeman
Abstract: Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) constitute a powerful variational ansatz for capturing ground state physics of two-dimensional quantum systems. However, accurately computing and minimizing the energy expectation value remains challenging, in part because the impact of the gauge degrees of freedom that are present in the tensor network representation is poorly understood. We analyze the role of gauge transformations for the case of a U(1)-symmetric PEPS with point group symmetry, thereby reducing the gauge degrees of freedom to a single class. We show how gradient-based optimization strategies exploit the gauge freedom, causing the tensor network contraction to become increasingly inaccurate and to produce artificially low variational energies. Furthermore, we develop a gauge-fixed optimization strategy that largely suppresses this effect, resulting in a more robust optimization. Our study underscores the need for gauge-aware optimization strategies to guarantee reliability of variational PEPS in general settings.

Title: Field-free superconducting diode effect in two-dimensional Shiba lattices
Authors: Sayak Bhowmik, Dibyendu Samanta, Ashis K. Nandy, Arijit Saha, Sudeep Kumar Ghosh
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) refers to non-reciprocal transport, where current flows without resistance in one direction but becomes resistive in the opposite direction, but its typical reliance on magnetic field hinders scalability and device integration. In this article, we present a theoretical framework for realizing a field-free SDE based on a two-dimensional (2D) Shiba lattice featuring a conical spin texture. Using the real-space Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) calculations, we illustrate that the conical spin configuration alone is sufficient to break the necessary inversion and time reversal symmetries, enabling nonreciprocal supercurrent flow without any external magnetic field, yielding diode efficiency exceeding 40%. Furthermore, we find that the efficiency of such a diode effect becomes strongly dependent on the direction of current flow, revealing a pronounced angular dependence that can be tuned by varying the pitches of the spin texture along the two spatial lattice directions. Our findings offer a pathway toward scalable, field-free superconducting components for non-dissipative electronics and quantum technologies.

Title: Dynamically tunable hydrodynamic transport in boron nitride-encapsulated graphene
Authors: Akash Gugnani, Aniket Majumdar, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Arindam Ghosh
Abstract: Over the past decade, graphene has emerged as a promising candidate for exploring the viscous nature of electronic flow facilitated by the availability of extremely high-quality devices employing a graphene channel encapsulated within dielectric layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, the level of disorder in such systems is mainly determined by the device fabrication protocols, making it impossible to obtain a tunability between the impurity-dominated and the viscous transport within the same device. In this work, using a combination of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and gate electric field, we have demonstrated a dynamic modulation of charge hydrodynamics, quantified in the thermal and electrical transport by the extent of departure from the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) Law in monolayer graphene devices at room temperature. We achieved this by tuning the disorder level continuously and reversibly using UV light to create transient trap states in the encapsulating hBN dielectric. With progressive UV radiation, we observed a dramatic increase in the momentum-relaxing scattering relative to that between the electrons and also the Lorentz number, by nearly a factor of ten, with increasing disorder, thereby approaching the restoration of the WF law in highly disordered graphene. Our experiments outline a potent strategy to tune the fundamental mechanism of charge flow in state-of-the-art graphene devices.

Title: Interaction enhanced inter-site hoppings for holons and interlayer exciton insulators in moiré correlated insulators
Authors: Zijian Ma, Hongyi Yu
Abstract: In moiré-patterned van der Waals structures of transition metal dichalcogenides, correlated insulators can form under integer and fractional fillings, whose transport properties are governed by various quasiparticle excitations including holons, doublons and interlayer exciton insulators. Here we theoretically investigate the nearest-neighbor inter-site hoppings of holons and interlayer exciton insulators. Our analysis indicates that these hopping strengths are significantly enhanced compared to that of a single carrier. The underlying mechanism can be attributed to the strong Coulomb interaction between carriers at different sites. For the interlayer exciton insulator consisting of a holon and a carrier in different layers, we have also obtained its effective Bohr radius and energy splitting between the ground and first-excited states.

Title: Deterministic roughening in the dc-driven precessional regime of domain walls
Authors: E. F. Pusiol, V. Lecomte, S. Bustingorry, A. B. Kolton
Abstract: We numerically study the dynamics of extended domain walls in homogeneous ferromagnets driven by a uniform magnetic field at zero temperature. Using both micromagnetic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations and a collective-coordinate model, we show that flat domain walls become linearly unstable above the Walker breakdown field and below a higher threshold, provided their length exceeds a characteristic value. This instability is captured by a quasi-universal spectral diagram, parameterized solely by the Gilbert damping, that predicts the onset of deviations from rigid-wall behavior. Beyond the linear regime, large domain walls with bands of unstable modes exhibit spatiotemporal chaos, intricate Bloch line motion, and deterministic roughening. The system undergoes a dynamical phase transition from a flat to a rough moving phase at a critical field.

Title: Exchange-driven self-diffusion of nanoscale crystalline parahydrogen clusters on graphite
Authors: K. M. Kolevski, M. Boninsegni
Abstract: Computer simulations yield evidence of superfluid behavior of nanoscale size clusters of parahydrogen adsorbed on a graphite substrate at low temperature ($T\lesssim 0.25 \text{ K}$). Clusters with a number of molecules between 7 and 12 display concurrent superfluidity and crystalline order, reflecting the corrugation of the substrate. Remarkably, it is found that specific clusters with a number of molecules ranging between 7 and 12 self-diffuse on the surface like free particles, despite the strong pinning effect of the substrate. This effect is underlain by coordinated quantum-mechanical exchanges of groups of identical molecules, i.e., it has no classical counterpart.

Title: New Materials, New Functionalities: Molecular Beam Epitaxy of Ultra-High Conductivity Oxides
Authors: Gaurab Rimal, Tanzila Tasnim, Brian Opatosky, Ryan B. Comes, Debarghya Mallick, Simon Kim, Rob G. Moore, Seongshik Oh, Matthew Brahlek
Abstract: Understanding fundamental properties of materials is necessary for all modern electronic technologies. Toward this end, the fabrication of new ultrapure thin film materials is critical to discover and understand novel properties that can allow further development of technology. Oxide materials are a vast material class abound with diverse properties, and, therefore, harnessing such phases is critical for realizing emerging technologies. Pushing forward, however, requires understanding basic properties of insulating, semiconducting and metallic oxides, as well as the more complex phases that arise out of strong electronic correlations unique to this class of materials. In this review, we will focus on one of the unique aspects of oxides: the ultra-high conductivity metallic state, which can be a critical component for future all-oxide microelectronics such as low-loss interconnects and gate-metals, spintronics, as well as future quantum technologies that employ emergent magnetic or superconducting ground states. Like most oxides, a critical challenge to understanding and ultimately integrating high-conductivity metals into new technologies is the ability to synthesize high-quality materials. Therefore, we will frame the discussions in the context of epitaxial film growth via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), which has provided insights into the electronic behavior of specific materials while providing samples with unprecedented quality. We will highlight and underscore how MBE has enabled developments and deeper understanding of their properties and how it plays a critical role in the future of this unique class of materials.

Title: Discovery of Niobium Hydride Precipitates in Superconducting Qubits
Authors: Zuhawn Sung, Daniel Bafia, Arely Cano, Akshay Murthy, Jaeyel Lee, Matthew J Reagor, Juan Rubio-Zuazo, Anna Grassellino, Alexander Romanenko
Abstract: We report the evidence of the formation of niobium hydride phase within niobium films on silicon substrates in superconducting qubits fabricated at Rigetti Computing. For this study, we combined complementary techniques, including room-temperature and cryogenic atomic force microscopy (AFM), synchrotron Xray diffraction, and time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS), to directly reveal the existence of niobium hydride precipitates in the Rigetti chip area. Upon cryogenic cooling, we observed variation in the size and morphology of the hydrides, ranging from small (5 nm) irregular shapes to large (~10-100 nm) domain within the Nb grains, fully converted to niobium hydrides. Since niobium hydrides are non-superconducting and can easily change in size and location upon different cooldowns to cryogenic temperature, our finding highlights a new and previously unknown source of decoherence in superconducting qubits. This contributes to both quasiparticle and two level system (TLS) losses, offering a potential explanation for changes in qubit performance upon cooldowns. Finally, by leveraging the RF performance of a 3D bulk Nb resonator, we can quantify RF dissipation on a superconducting qubit, caused by hydrogen concentration variation, and are able to propose a practical engineering pathway to mitigate the formation of the Nb hydrides for superconducting qubit applications.

Title: Random Permutation Circuits are Quantum Chaotic
Authors: Bruno Bertini, Katja Klobas, Pavel Kos, Daniel Malz
Abstract: Random permutation circuits were recently introduced as minimal models for local many-body dynamics that can be interpreted both as classical and quantum. Standard indicators of chaos such as damage spreading, show that these systems exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions in the classical setting. Here, we address their quantum chaoticity by studying the time evolution of local operator entanglement (LOE). We show that the behaviour of LOE in random permutation circuits depends on the dimension of the local configuration space q. When q = 2, i.e. the circuits act on qubits, random permutations are Clifford and the LOE of any local operator is bounded by a constant, indicating that they are not truly chaotic. On the other hand, when the dimension of the local configuration space exceeds two, the LOE grows linearly in time. We prove this in the limit of large dimensions and present numerical evidence that a three-dimensional local configuration space is sufficient for a linear growth of LOE. Our findings highlight that quantum chaos can be produced by essentially classical dynamics. Moreover, we show that LOE can be defined also in the classical realm and put it forward as a universal indicator chaos, both quantum and classical.

Title: Exceptional flat bands in bipartite non-Hermitian quantum crystals
Authors: Juan Pablo Esparza, Vladimir Juricic
Abstract: Flat bands, in which kinetic energy is quenched and quantum states become macroscopically degenerate, host a rich variety of correlated and topological phases, from unconventional superconductors to fractional Chern insulators. In Hermitian lattices, their formation mechanisms are now well understood, but whether such states persist, and acquire new features in non-Hermitian (NH) quantum crystals, relevant to open and driven systems, has remained an open question. Here we show that the Hermitian principle for flat-band formation in bipartite lattices, based on a sublattice degeneracy mismatch, extends directly to the NH regime: whenever one sublattice hosts a momentum-independent eigenvalue with degeneracy exceeding that of its partner on the other sublattice, flat bands arise regardless of gain, loss, or complex couplings. Strikingly, at exceptional points, dispersive bands coalesce to form \emph{exceptional flat bands} that persist beyond these singularities, exhibiting biorthogonal eigenmodes spanning both sublattices, with energies and lifetimes tunable via sublattice asymmetry and non-reciprocal couplings. This general framework unifies Hermitian and NH flat-band constructions, and reveals dispersionless states with no closed-system analogue. The proposed construction is applicable to synthetic platforms, from classical metamaterials, where flat bands can be directly emulated, to quantum-engineered systems such as photonic crystals and ultracold atom arrays, which should host correlated and topological phases emerging from such exceptional flat bands.

Title: Quantum circuit simulation with a local time-dependent variational principle
Authors: Aaron Sander, Maximilian Fröhlich, Mazen Ali, Martin Eigel, Jens Eisert, Michael Hintermüller, Christian B. Mendl, Richard M. Milbradt, Robert Wille
Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum circuits are vital for assessing potential quantum advantage and benchmarking devices, yet they require sophisticated methods to avoid the exponential growth of resources. Tensor network approaches, in particular matrix product states (MPS) combined with the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, currently dominate large-scale circuit simulations. These methods scale efficiently when entanglement is limited but suffer rapid bond dimension growth with increasing entanglement and handle long-range gates via costly SWAP insertions. Motivated by the success of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) in many-body physics, we reinterpret quantum circuits as a series of discrete time evolutions, using gate generators to construct an MPS-based circuit simulation via a local TDVP formulation. This addresses TEBD's key limitations by (1) naturally accommodating long-range gates and (2) optimally representing states on the MPS manifold. By diffusing entanglement more globally, the method suppresses local bond growth and reduces memory and runtime costs. We benchmark the approach on five 49-qubit circuits: three Hamiltonian circuits (1D open and periodic Heisenberg, 2D 7x7 Ising) and two algorithmic ones (quantum approximate optimization, hardware-efficient ansatz). Across all cases, our method yields substantial resource reductions over standard tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art for circuit simulation and enabling advances across quantum computing, condensed matter, and beyond.

Title: Majorana braiding simulations with projective measurements
Authors: Philipp Frey, Themba Hodge, Eric Mascot, Stephan Rachel
Abstract: We summarize the key ingredients required for universal topological quantum computation using Majorana zero modes in networks of topological superconductor nanowires. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of both sparse and dense logical qubit encodings, and on the transitions between them via projective parity measurements. Combined with hybridization, these operations extend the computational capabilities beyond braiding alone and enable universal gate sets. In addition to outlining the theoretical foundations-including the algebra of Majorana operators, along with the stabilizer formalism-we introduce an efficient numerical method for simulating the time-dependent dynamics of such systems. This method, based on the time dependent Pfaffian formalism, allows for the classical simulation of realistic device architectures that incorporate braiding, projective measurements, and disorder. The result is a semi-pedagogical overview and computational toolbox designed to support further exploration of topological quantum computing platforms.

Title: Projective Measurements: Topological Quantum Computing with an Arbitrary Number of Qubits
Authors: Themba Hodge, Philipp Frey, Stephan Rachel
Abstract: Topological quantum computing promises intrinsic fault tolerance by encoding quantum information in non-Abelian anyons, where quantum gates are implemented via braiding. While braiding operations are robust against local perturbations, a critical yet often overlooked challenge arises when scaling beyond two qubits: the naive extension of braiding based gates fails to support even the full Clifford group. To overcome this limitation, we incorporate projective measurements that enable transitions between different qubit encodings, thus restoring computational universality. We perform many-body simulations of braiding dynamics augmented with measurement-based switching, explicitly preparing the Bell state and GHZ state for systems of two and five qubits, respectively. Furthermore, we execute a random unitary circuit on five qubits, achieving a fidelity exceeding 99%. We analyze the circuit's robustness by studying its fidelity dependence on total braid duration and static potential disorder. Our results show that the fidelity remains above 99% for moderate disorder, underscoring the intrinsic fault tolerance of the architecture. Finally, we demonstrate a random circuit on a ten qubit system to showcase the scalability of our techniques.

Title: Patient-Specific 3D Printed Dynamic Preoperative Planning Models in Modern Medicine
Authors: Keshav Jha, Joseph Mayer
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) printed preoperative planning models serve a critical role in the success of many medical procedures. However, many of these models do not portray the patient's complete anatomy due to their monolithic and static nature. The use of dynamic 3D-printed models can better equip physicians by providing a more anatomically accurate model due to its movement capabilities and the ability to remove and replace printed anatomies based on planning stages. A dynamic 3D-printed preoperative planning model has the capability to move in similar ways to the anatomy that is being represented by the model, or reveal additional issues that may arise during the use of a movement mechanism. The 3D-printed models are constructed in a similar manner to their static counterparts; however, in the digital post-processing phase, additional care is needed to ensure the dynamic functionality of the model. Here, we discuss the process of creating a dynamic 3D-printed model and its benefits and uses in modern medicine.

Title: Nonlocal Monte Carlo via Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Dmitrii Dobrynin, Masoud Mohseni, John Paul Strachan
Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy, time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

Title: Variational Time Evolution Compression for Solving Impurity Models on Quantum Hardware
Authors: Stefan Wolf, Martin Eckstein, Michael J. Hartmann
Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is a useful tool to analyze models of strongly correlated fermions like the Hubbard model. In DMFT, the lattice of the model is replaced by a single impurity site embedded in an effective bath. The resulting single impurity Anderson model (SIAM) can then be solved self-consistently with a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm. This procedure involves repeatedly preparing the ground state on a quantum computer and evolving it in time to measure the Greens function. We here develop an approximation of the time evolution operator for this setting by training a Hamiltonian variational ansatz. The parameters of the ansatz are obtained via a variational quantum algorithm that utilizes a small number of time steps, given by the Suzuki- Trotter expansion of the time evolution operator, to guide the evolution of the parameters. The resulting circuit has constant depth for the time evolution and is significantly shallower than a comparable Suzuki-Trotter expansion.

Title: AEGISS -- Atomic orbital and Entropy-based Guided Inference for Space Selection -- A novel semi-automated active space selection workflow for quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications
Authors: Fabio Tarocco, Pi A. B. Haase, Fabijan Pavošević, Vijay Krishna, Leonardo Guidoni, Stefan Knecht, Martina Stella
Abstract: The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a wide range of molecular systems. In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks. Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community.

Title: An Open-Source User-Friendly Interface for Simulating Magnetic Soft Robots using Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA)
Authors: Carla Wehner, Finn Schubert, Heiko Hellkamp, Julius Hahnewald, Kilian Scheafer, Muhammad Bilal Khan, Oliver Gutfleisch
Abstract: Soft robots, particularly magnetic soft robots, require specialized simulation tools to accurately model their deformation under external magnetic fields. However, existing platforms often lack dedicated support for magnetic materials, making them difficult to use for researchers at different expertise levels. This work introduces an open-source, user-friendly simulation interface using the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), specifically designed to model magnetic soft robots. The tool enables users to define material properties, apply magnetic fields, and observe resulting deformations in real time. By integrating intuitive controls and stress analysis capabilities, it aims to bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical design. Four benchmark models - a beam, three- and four-finger grippers, and a butterfly - demonstrate its functionality. The software's ease of use makes it accessible to both beginners and advanced researchers. Future improvements will refine accuracy through experimental validation and comparison with industry-standard finite element solvers, ensuring realistic and predictive simulations of magnetic soft robots.

Title: Artificial discovery of lattice models for wave transport
Authors: Jonas Landgraf, Clara C. Wanjura, Vittorio Peano, Florian Marquardt
Abstract: Wave transport devices, such as amplifiers, frequency converters, and nonreciprocal devices, are essential for modern communication, signal processing, and sensing applications. Of particular interest are traveling wave setups, which offer excellent gain and bandwidth properties. So far, the conceptual design of those devices has relied on human ingenuity. This makes it difficult and time-consuming to explore the full design space under a variety of constraints and target functionalities. In our work, we present a method which automates this challenge. By optimizing the discrete and continuous parameters of periodic coupled-mode lattices, our approach identifies the simplest lattices that achieve the target transport functionality, and we apply it to discover new schemes for directional amplifiers, isolators, and frequency demultiplexers. Leveraging automated symbolic regression tools, we find closed analytical expressions that facilitate the discovery of generalizable construction rules. Moreover, we utilize important conceptual connections between the device transport properties and non-Hermitian topology. The resulting structures can be implemented on a variety of platforms, including microwave, optical, and optomechanical systems. Our approach opens the door to extensions like the artificial discovery of lattice models with desired properties in higher dimensions or with nonlinear interactions.

Title: Run-and-Tumble Escape in Pursuit-Evasion Dynamics of Intelligent Active Particles
Authors: Segun Goh, Dennis Haustein, Gerhard Gompper
Abstract: The pursuit-evasion game is studied for two adversarial active agents, modelled as a deterministic self-steering pursuer and a stochastic, cognitive evader. The pursuer chases the evader by reorienting its propulsion direction with limited maneuverability, while the evader escapes by executing sharp, unpredictable turns, whose timing and direction the pursuer cannot anticipate. To make the target responsive and agile when the threat level is high, the tumbling frequency is set to increase with decreasing distance from the pursuer; furthermore, the range of preferred tumbling directions is varied. Numerical simulations of such a pursuit-target pair in two spatial dimensions reveal two important scenarios. For dominant pursuers, the evader is compelled to adopt a high-risk strategy that allows the pursuer to approach closely before the evader executes a potentially game-changing backward maneuver to pull away from the pursuer. Otherwise, a strategy where the evader tumbles forward with continuous slight adjustments of the propulsion direction can significantly increase the capture time by preventing the pursuer from aligning with the target propulsion direction, while maintaining the persistence of the target motion. Our results can guide the design of bioinspired robotic systems with efficient evasion capabilities.

Title: Notes from the Physics Teaching Lab: NMR Experiments at 21 Gauss
Authors: Kenneth G. Libbrecht
Abstract: We describe a series of laboratory experiments that can be performed with the Quantum Control apparatus sold by TeachSpin, which uses pulsed NMR techniques to observe the precession of protons in a liquid water sample. With a uniform background magnetic field of 21 Gauss, the protons precess at about 90 kHz, yielding numerous relatively simple observations and measurements that are well suited to undergraduate physics teaching labs. Our goal in this paper is to document some of these experiments in detail, thereby making it easier for instructors to choose material that is best suited for their curricula.

Title: Performance of universal machine-learned potentials with explicit long-range interactions in biomolecular simulations
Authors: Viktor Zaverkin, Matheus Ferraz, Francesco Alesiani, Mathias Niepert
Abstract: Universal machine-learned potentials promise transferable accuracy across compositional and vibrational degrees of freedom, yet their application to biomolecular simulations remains underexplored. This work systematically evaluates equivariant message-passing architectures trained on the SPICE-v2 dataset with and without explicit long-range dispersion and electrostatics. We assess the impact of model size, training data composition, and electrostatic treatment across in- and out-of-distribution benchmark datasets, as well as molecular simulations of bulk liquid water, aqueous NaCl solutions, and biomolecules, including alanine tripeptide, the mini-protein Trp-cage, and Crambin. While larger models improve accuracy on benchmark datasets, this trend does not consistently extend to properties obtained from simulations. Predicted properties also depend on the composition of the training dataset. Long-range electrostatics show no systematic impact across systems. However, for Trp-cage, their inclusion yields increased conformational variability. Our results suggest that imbalanced datasets and immature evaluation practices currently challenge the applicability of universal machine-learned potentials to biomolecular simulations.

Title: Nodal pair density waves from a quarter-metal in crystalline graphene multilayers
Authors: Sk Asrap Murshed, Bitan Roy
Abstract: Crystalline graphene heterostructures, namely, Bernal bilayer graphene (BBLG) and rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTLG), for example, subject to perpendicular electric displacement fields, display a rich confluence of competing orders, resulting in a valley-degenerate, spin-polarized half-metal at moderate doping, and a spin- and valley-polarized (non-degenerate) quarter-metal at lower doping. Here we show that such a quarter-metal can be susceptible toward the nucleation of a unique spin- and valley-polarized superconducting ground state, accommodating \emph{odd-parity} (dominantly $p$ wave in BBLG and $f$ wave in RTLG) inter-layer Cooper pairs that break the translational symmetry, giving rise to a Kekulé (in BBLG) or columnar (in RTLG) pair density wave. Due to the trigonal warping in the normal state, the superconducting ground state produces three-fold rotationally symmetric isolated Fermi rings of normal fermions, which can manifest via linear in temperature scaling of the specific heat. We present scaling of the zero-temperature pairing amplitude and the transition temperature of such pair density wave in the presence of trigonally warped disconnected, annular, and simply connected Fermi rings in the normal state, subject to an effective attractive interaction within a mean-field approximation.

Title: Defining classical and quantum chaos through adiabatic transformations
Authors: Hyeongjin Kim, Cedric Lim, Kirill Matirko, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Michael O. Flynn
Abstract: We propose a formalism which defines chaos in both quantum and classical systems in an equivalent manner by means of \textit{adiabatic transformations}. The complexity of adiabatic transformations which preserve classical time-averaged trajectories (quantum eigenstates) in response to Hamiltonian deformations serves as a measure of chaos. This complexity is quantified by the (properly regularized) fidelity susceptibility. Physically this measure quantifies long time instabilities of physical observables due to small changes in the Hamiltonian of the system. Our exposition clearly showcases the common structures underlying quantum and classical chaos and allows us to distinguish integrable, chaotic but non-thermalizing, and ergodic/mixing regimes. We apply the fidelity susceptibility to a model of two coupled spins and demonstrate that it successfully predicts the universal onset of chaos, both for finite spin $S$ and in the classical limit $S\to\infty$. Interestingly, we find that finite $S$ effects are anomalously large close to integrability.

Title: Entanglement area law and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem in long-range interacting systems, and symmetry-enforced long-range entanglement
Authors: Ruizhi Liu, Jinmin Yi, Shiyu Zhou, Liujun Zou
Abstract: We establish multiple interrelated, fundamental results in quantum many-body systems that can have long-range interactions. For a sufficiently long quantum spin chain, we first show that if the multi-spin interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as their ranges increase and the Hamiltonian is gapped, then the ground states satisfy the entanglement area law, even if there is a ground state degeneracy due to a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry. This area law also holds for certain excited states. Second, if such a long-range interacting Hamiltonian has an anomalous symmetry, then the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem applies, i.e., the Hamiltonian cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state. If the Hamiltonian contains only 2-spin interactions, these results hold when the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, with $r$ the distance between the two interacting spins. Third, we show that pure states with an anomalous symmetry, which may not be a ground state of any natural Hamiltonian, must be long-range entangled. The symmetries we consider include on-site internal symmetries combined with lattice translation symmetries, and they can also extend to purely internal but non-on-site symmetries. Moreover, these internal symmetries can be discrete or continuous. We explore the applications of these results through various examples.

Title: Slowly generated anomalously large nuclear field in bulk n-AlGaAs
Authors: A. Shen, J. Chen, R. Kaji, S. Yamamoto, H. Sasakura, T. Uemura, S. Adachi
Abstract: This study investigated the formation and relaxation dynamics of nuclear spin polarization in three Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As bulk samples with different aluminum concentrations $x$ of 0.00, 0.05, and 0.15. The time-resolved Kerr rotation technique was primarily used. The samples with $x$ = 0.15 and 0.05 exhibited anomalously large nuclear magnetic fields BN exceeding 1 T, approximately twice the applied magnetic field. Further investigations revealed that BN formation occurred in two-stages, a rapid initial rise followed by a gradual increase toward a saturation value. Relaxation measurements revealed that the relaxation time of BN was longer for AlGaAs than for GaAs. The comparison of the results obtained under strong and weak magnetic fields indicated the suppression of quadrupole-induced relaxation. We modified the dynamics model of nuclear spin polarization and explained the two-stage formation and the accompanying large BN in AlGaAs bulks.

Title: Evaluation of the probability current in the stochastic path integral formalism
Authors: Valentin Wilhelm, Matthias Krüger, Matthias Fuchs, Florian Vogel
Abstract: The probability current is a vital quantity in the Fokker-Planck description of stochastic processes. It characterizes non-equilibrium stationary states and appears in linear response calculations. We recover and review the probability current in the Onsager-Machlup functional approach to Markov processes by deriving a self-contained expression in general non-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relations using field theoretical methods. The derived formulas hold for non-constant drift and diffusion tensors and are explicitly evaluated in an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with non-reciprocal interactions specified as a harmonically bound particle in shear flow. Our work clarifies the concept of the probability current -- familiar from the Fokker-Planck equation -- in the path integral approach.

Title: Bootstrapping, Autonomous Testing, and Initialization System for Si/SiGe Multi-quantum Dot Devices
Authors: Tyler J. Kovach, Daniel Schug, M. A. Wolfe, E. R. MacQuarrie, Patrick J. Walsh, Owen M. Eskandari, Jared Benson, Mark Friesen, M. A. Eriksson, Justyna P. Zwolak
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices have become central to advancements in spin-based quantum computing. However, the increasing complexity of modern QD devices makes calibration and control -- particularly at elevated temperatures -- a bottleneck to progress, highlighting the need for robust and scalable autonomous solutions. A major hurdle arises from trapped charges within the oxide layers, which induce random offset voltage shifts on gate electrodes, with a standard deviation of approximately 83~\si{\milli\volt} of variation within state-of-the-art present-day devices. Efficient characterization and tuning of large arrays of QD qubits depend on choices of automated protocols. Here, we introduce a physically intuitive framework for a bootstrapping, autonomous testing, and initialization system (BATIS) designed to streamline QD device evaluation and calibration. BATIS navigates high-dimensional gate voltage spaces, automating essential steps such as leakage testing, formation of all current channels, and gate characterization in the presence of trapped charges. For forming the current channels, BATIS follows a non-standard approach that requires a single set of measurements regardless of the number of channels. Demonstrated at $1.3$~\si{\kelvin} on a quad-QD Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ device, BATIS eliminates the need for deep cryogenic environments during initial device diagnostics, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing setup times. By requiring only minimal prior knowledge of the device architecture, BATIS represents a platform-agnostic solution, adaptable to various QD systems, which bridges a critical gap in QD autotuning.

Title: Superconducting and spin-density wave phases probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy in the organic conductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$
Authors: Mohammadmehdi Torkzadeh, Pascale Senzier, Claude Bourbonnais, Abdelouahab Sedeki, Cécile Méziere, Marie Hervé, Francois Debontridder, Pascal David, Tristan Cren, Claire Marrache-Kikuchi, Denis Jerome, Christophe Brun
Abstract: By scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we have probed the local quasi-particle density of states (DOS) of the Bechgaard salt organic superconductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$ in slowly cooled single crystals cleaved under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. In well STM imaged crystallographic surface planes, the local DOS has been probed for different surface areas at temperatures above and below the critical temperature of superconducting or insulating spin-density wave states. While a rather homogeneous superconducting state is expected in the bulk from previous studies, depending on the degree of disorder introduced by cleavage in the anion lattice, an inhomogeneous granular state is predominantly observed at the surface. A pronounced linear V-shape profile of the local DOS is observed from intermediate to the lowest energy scale in the less disordered superconducting surface areas. This supports the existence of an unconventional d-wave like order parameter with nodes at low energy, which is preceded by more energetic fluctuations attributed to quantum criticality of the material. At higher energy disorder combined to correlations deplete further the DOS. By contrast a non-linear U-shape characterizes the local low energy DOS profile for the more disordered and insulating surface areas of the spin-density wave state. The experimental results are compared quantitatively with those predicted by the renormalization group theory of the quasi-one dimensional electron gas model and its description of the superconducting and spin-density wave states that are interlinked by quantum criticality in the Bechgaard salts.

Title: Interplay between trimer structure and magnetic ground state in Ba5Ru3O12 probed by Neutron and muSR techniques
Authors: E. Kushwaha, S. Ghosh, J. Sannigrahi, G. Roy, M. Kumar, S.Cottrell, M. B. Stone, Y. Fang, D. T. Adroja, X. Ke, T. Basu
Abstract: We report a detailed inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and muon spin relaxation (muSR) investigation of a trimer Ruthenate Ba5Ru3O12 system, which undergoes long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at TN = 60 K. The INS reveals two distinct spin wave excitations below TN: one at 5.6 meV and the other at 10-15 meV. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a linear spin wave theory using SpinW software and machine learning force fields (MLFFs), we show that Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits spin frustration due to competing exchange interactions between neighboring and next-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy, and strong spin-orbit coupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in contrast to other ruthenate trimers in this series. Interestingly, these magnetic excitations do not completely vanish even at high temperatures above TN, evidencing short-range magnetic correlations in this trimer system. This is further supported by muSR spectroscopy, which exhibits a gradual drop in the initial asymmetry around the magnetic phase transition and is further verified through maximum entropy analysis. The results of muSR spectroscopy indicate a dynamic nature of magnetic order, attributed to local magnetic anisotropy within the trimer as a result of local structural distortion and different hybridization, consistent with canted spin-structure. We predict the ground state of Ru3O12-isolated trimer through theoretical calculations, which agree with the experimentally observed spin excitation

Title: Minimal mechanism for flocking in phoretically interacting active particles
Authors: Arvin Gopal Subramaniam, Sagarika Adhikary, Rajesh Singh
Abstract: Collective motion as a flock is a widely observed phenomenon in active matter systems. We report a flocking transition mechanism in a system of chemically interacting active colloidal particles sustained purely by chemo-repulsive torques at low to medium densities. The basic requirements to maintain the polar liquid flock are excluded volume repulsions and deterministic long-ranged net repulsive torques. The mechanism we report requires that the time scale individual colloids move a unit length to be dominant with respect to the time they deterministically sense chemicals. This can be equivalently interpreted as pair colloids sliding a minimal unit length before deterministically rotating due to chemical interactions. Switching on the translational repulsive forces renders the flock a crystalline structure. We complement these results with an analysis of a continuum hydrodynamic model, with the transition corresponding to destabilization of the flocking state.

Title: Symmetries, Conservation Laws and Entanglement in Non-Hermitian Fermionic Lattices
Authors: Rafael D. Soares, Youenn Le Gal, Chun Y. Leung, Dganit Meidan, Alessandro Romito, Marco Schirò
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems feature steady-state entanglement transitions driven by the competition between unitary dynamics and dissipation. In this work, we reveal the fundamental role of conservation laws in shaping this competition. Focusing on translation-invariant non-interacting fermionic models with U(1) symmetry, we present a theoretical framework to understand the structure of the steady-state of these models and their entanglement content based on two ingredients: the nature of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the constraints imposed on the steady-state single-particle occupation by the conserved quantities. These emerge from an interplay between Hamiltonian symmetries and initial state, due to the non-linearity of measurement back-action. For models with complex energy spectrum, we show that the steady state is obtained by filling single-particle right eigenstates with the largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue. As a result, one can have partially filled or fully filled bands in the steady-state, leading to an entanglement entropy undergoing a filling-driven transition between critical sub volume scaling and area-law, similar to ground-state problems. Conversely, when the spectrum is fully real, we provide evidence that local observables can be captured using a diagonal ensemble, and the entanglement entropy exhibits a volume-law scaling independently on the initial state, akin to unitary dynamics. We illustrate these principles in the Hatano-Nelson model with periodic boundary conditions and the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, uncovering a rich interplay between the single-particle spectrum and conservation laws in determining the steady-state structure and the entanglement transitions. These conclusions are supported by exact analytical calculations and numerical calculations relying on the Faber polynomial method.

Title: Neuronal correlations shape the scaling behavior of memory capacity and nonlinear computational capability of reservoir recurrent neural networks
Authors: Shotaro Takasu, Toshio Aoyagi
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning, with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this paper, we investigate how the computational ability of reservoir recurrent neural networks (RNNs) scales with an increasing number of readout neurons. First, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir RNN scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate this observation, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity that incorporates the effect of neuronal correlations, which have been ignored in prior theoretical work for analytical simplicity. Our theory successfully relates the sublinear scaling of memory capacity to the strength of neuronal correlations. Furthermore, we show this principle holds across diverse types of RNNs, even those beyond the direct applicability of our theory. Next, we numerically investigate the scaling behavior of nonlinear computational ability, which, alongside memory capacity, is crucial for overall computational performance. Our numerical simulations reveal that as memory capacity growth becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and nonlinear processing.

Title: Sound Attenuation in Glasses
Authors: Grzegorz Szamel, Elijah Flenner
Abstract: Comprehending sound damping is integral to understanding the anomalous low temperature properties of glasses. Despite decades of studies, the underlying mechanism of sound damping in glasses is still debated. In this perspective we review recent work on sound damping in amorphous solids. We focus on the role of defects, heterogeneous elasticity, and damping in model amorphous solids without defects. We review our definition of damping defects and show that they strongly influence sound damping. However, we also find another contribution to sound damping that cannot be attributed to damping defects. We confirm an earlier result of Kapteijns et al. [G. Kapteijns et al., J. Chem. Phys. 154, 081101 (2021)] that heterogeneous elasticity theory predicts relative changes of sound damping in model two-dimensional glasses if the configuration-to-configuration elastic constants fluctuations are used to quantify the heterogeneity. We extend this finding to similar three-dimensional glasses. We end by discussing the Euclidean Random Matrix model, which exhibits Rayleigh scaling of sound damping, but does not have quasi-localized excitations, and thus probably does not have sound damping defects. We propose that the mechanisms behind sound damping can be more fully understood by approaching the problem from two directions, one where the strong influence of defects is studied and another where sound damping is studied in defect free albeit disordered materials.

Title: Critical Behavior Analysis of Pure Dipolar Triangular Lattice via Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium Monte Carlo Simulations
Authors: S. Ismailzadeh, M. D. Niry
Abstract: Magnetic thin films and 2D arrays of magnetic nanoparticles exhibit unique physical properties that make them valuable for a wide range of technological applications. In such systems, dipolar interactions play a crucial role in determining their physical behavior. However, due to the anisotropic and long-range nature of dipolar interactions, conventional Monte Carlo (MC) methods face challenges in investigating these systems near criticality. In this study, we examine the critical behavior of a triangular lattice of XY dipoles using the optimized Tomita MC algorithm tailored for dipolar interactions. We employ two independent computational approaches to estimate the critical temperature and exponents: equilibrium MC simulations with histogram reweighting and the non-equilibrium relaxation method. Notably, both approaches demonstrate that this XY dipolar system might be in a new universality class very close to the 2D Ising universality class.

Title: The role of confined water in the emergence of electrostatic strong coupling as revealed by nanoseparated charged lipid layers
Authors: Swen Helstroffer, Ludovic Gardré, Giovanna Fragneto, Arnaud Hemmerle, Léo Henry, Laurent Joly, Fabrice Thalmann, Claire Loison, Pierre Muller, Thierry Charitat
Abstract: This study investigates the interplay between Strong Coupling (SC) attraction and hydration repulsion in nanoconfined water between like-charged phospholipid layers. It challenges the assumption that SC attraction requires multivalent counterions by showing that hydration water can enhance electrostatic interactions. We combine reflectivities with numerical simulations to analyze supported phospholipid layers under different relative humidity and surface charge densities. X-ray fluorescence demonstrates that we can control the valence of the associated counterions. Experimental measurement of the water thickness, combined with precise determination of charged surface positions by numerical simulations, enable us to compare our experiments with a theoretical model. It shows that charge-screening by hydration water induces SC attraction, even at moderate surface charge densities with monovalent counterions. Furthermore, hydration repulsion is stronger for DPPS compared to DPPC. These findings offer insights into the forces that control interactions between phospholipid layers and have important implications for biological and colloidal systems.

Abstract: In-operando characterization of van der Waals (vdW) devices using surface-sensitive methods provides critical insights into phase transitions and correlated electronic states. Yet, integrating vdW materials in functional devices while maintaining pristine surfaces is a key challenge for combined transport and surface-sensitive experiments. Conventional lithographic techniques introduce surface contamination, limiting the applicability of state-of-the-art spectroscopic probes. We present a stencil lithography-based approach for fabricating vdW devices, producing micron-scale electrical contacts, and exfoliation in ultra-high vacuum. The resist-free patterning method utilizes a shadow mask to define electrical contacts and yields thin flakes down to the single-layer regime via gold-assisted exfoliation. As a demonstration, we fabricate devices from 1$T-$TaS$_2$ flakes, achieving reliable contacts for application of electrical pulses and resistance measurements, as well as clean surfaces allowing for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The approach provides a platform for studying the electronic properties of vdW systems with surface-sensitive probes in well-defined device geometries.

Title: Beyond the Electric Dipole Approximation: Electric and Magnetic Multipole Contributions Reveal Biaxial Water Structure from SFG Spectra at the Air-Water Interface
Authors: Louis Lehmann, Maximilian R. Becker, Lucas Tepper, Alexander P. Fellows, Álvaro Díaz Duque, Martin Thämer, Roland R. Netz
Abstract: The interpretation of sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectra has been severely limited by the absence of quantitative theoretical predictions of higher-order multipole contributions. The previously unknown magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contributions are determined by bulk properties but appear in all experimental SFG spectra, obscuring the connection between measured spectra and interfacial structure. We present the simulation-based framework that predicts the full set of multipole spectral contributions. This framework also yields depth-resolved spectra, enabling the precise localization of spectroscopic features. Applied to the air-water interface, our approach achieves quantitative agreement with experimental spectra for different polarization combinations in both the bending and stretching regions. Higher-order multipole contributions are crucial for correctly interpreting SFG spectra: in the bending band, the electric dipole and the magnetic dipole contributions have similar intensities, and the electric quadrupole contribution is significantly larger. In the OH-stretch region, the electric quadrupole contribution is found to be responsible for the mysterious shoulder at 3600 cm$^{-1}$. Crucially, subtracting the quadrupole and magnetic contributions isolates the second-order electric dipole susceptibility, which is a quantitative probe for interfacial orientational anisotropy. This electric-dipole susceptibility reveals a pronounced biaxial ordering of water at the air-water interface. By resolving a fundamental limitation of the interpretation of SFG spectroscopy, our framework allows for the detailed extraction of interfacial water ordering from SFG spectra.

Title: Current-induced spin and orbital polarization in the ferroelectric Rashba semiconductor GeTe
Authors: Sergio Leiva-Montecinos, Libor Vojáček, Jing Li, Mairbek Chshiev, Laurent Vila, Ingrid Mertig, Annika Johansson
Abstract: The Edelstein effect is a promising mechanism for generating spin and orbital polarization from charge currents in systems without inversion symmetry. In ferroelectric materials, such as Germanium Telluride (GeTe), the combination of bulk Rashba splitting and voltage-controlled ferroelectric polarization provides a pathway for electrical control of the sign of the charge-spin conversion. In this work, we investigate current-induced spin and orbital magnetization in bulk GeTe using Wannier-based tight-binding models derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann theory. Employing the modern theory of orbital magnetization, we demonstrate that the orbital Edelstein effect entirely dominates its spin counterpart. This difference is visualized through the spin and orbital textures at the Fermi surfaces, where the orbital moment surpasses the spin moment by one order of magnitude. Moreover, the orbital Edelstein effect remains largely unaffected in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, highlighting its distinct physical origin compared to the spin Edelstein effect.

Title: Propylenidene: A Novel Metallic Carbon Monolayer with Unconventional Ring Topology
Authors: Jose A. S. Laranjeira, K. A. L. Lima, Nicolas F. Martins, Luis A. Cabral, L.A. Ribeiro Junior, Julio R. Sambrano
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes have drawn significant interest owing to their impressive physical and chemical characteristics. Following graphene's isolation, a wide range of 2D carbon materials has been suggested, each with distinct electronic, mechanical, and optical traits. Rational design and synthesis of new 2D carbon structures hinge on experimentally reported precursors. Here, we present a 2D carbon allotrope, propylenidene (PPD), originating from bicyclopropylidene. PPD forms a rectangular lattice with 3, 8, and 10-membered carbon rings. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations investigate its structural, electronic, mechanical, and optical properties. Our study shows PPD to be metallic. PPD exhibits absorption in the infrared and visible range, showing directional dependence in its response. Mechanically, PPD exhibits marked anisotropy; Young's modulus ($Y$) varies between 205.83 N/m and 164.46 N/m. These findings underscore the potential of this novel monolayer in applications such as energy storage, gas sensing, and optoelectronics.

Title: Tension-Induced Soft Stress and Viscoelastic Bending in Liquid Crystal Elastomers for Enhanced Energy Dissipation
Authors: Beijun Shen, Yuefeng Jiang, Christopher M. Yakacki, Sung Hoon Kang, Thao D. Nguyen
Abstract: Architected materials that exploit buckling instabilities to reversibly trap energy have been shown to be effective for impact protection. The energy-absorbing capabilities of these architected materials can be enhanced further by incorporating viscoelastic material behavior into the buckling elements using liquid crystal elastomers (LCE). In addition to conventional viscoelastic behavior, LCEs also exhibit a highly dissipative rate-dependent soft stress response from mesogen rotation under a mechanical load. However, the buckling elements cannot take advantage of this dissipation mechanism because buckling occurs at strains below the threshold for mesogen rotation. In this study, we investigate tension-induced soft stress behavior as an additional dissipation mechanism in horizontal members of lattice structures composed of tilted LCE beams under compression. Viscoelastic properties of LCEs with two crosslinking densities were characterized experimentally, and a nonlinear viscoelastic model was implemented in Abaqus/Standard as a user-defined element to simulate finite-strain behavior of monodomain LCEs, including soft stress response. Simulations and experiments revealed a non-monotonic dependence of energy dissipation on the thickness ratio between horizontal and tilted LCE members. Optimized structures with stretchable horizontal bars dissipated 2-3 times more energy than rigid-bar counterparts by balancing tension-driven soft stress with viscoelastic beam bending. These findings demonstrate a new design strategy for LCE-based architected materials to enhance energy dissipation.

Title: Importance of anisotropic interactions for hard-axis/plane ordering of Ce-based ferromagnets
Authors: Hanshang Jin, Rahim R. Ullah, Peter Klavins, Valentin Taufour
Abstract: Ferromagnetic (FM) Kondo-lattice (KL) compounds often exhibit intriguing magnetic behavior driven by strong crystal electric field (CEF) anisotropy and exchange interactions. Recent studies suggest that many Ce-based and Yb-based KL ferromagnets order along the hard-axis or hard-plane determined by their CEF ground state. We performed a survey of Ce-based FM compounds, complemented with new single crystal synthesis, magnetization measurements, and analysis of the CEF scheme. Our results reveal that hard-axis/plane ordering is less common than previously reported, with most compounds ordering along their easy-axis/plane. We also find no clear correlation between the strength of the Kondo effect and whether a compound adopts hard-axis/plane or easy-axis/plane ordering. Instead, the key driver appears to be the competition between CEF anisotropy and exchange interaction anisotropy. A direct comparison of CeCuSi and CeAgSb$_2$ further indicates that antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions along the CEF easy-axis can be crucial in stabilizing the hard-axis FM ordering observed in CeAgSb$_2$. Finally, our results suggest that an anisotropic Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) model could offer deeper insights into the complicated magnetic properties of Ce-based and other heavy-fermion systems.

Title: Nanoscale friction of manganite superlattice films controlled by layer thickness and fluorine content
Authors: Niklas A. Weber, Miru Lee, Florian Schönewald, Leonard Schüler, Vasily Moshnyaga, Matthias Krüger, Cynthia A. Volkert
Abstract: We investigate nanoscale friction in [LaMnO3]m/[SrMnO3]n superlattice films using lateral force microscopy, focusing on the effects of fluorine doping and top-layer thickness. For all samples, friction forces scale linearly with the sum of the applied normal and adhesion forces. While friction forces vary spatially due to local adhesion fluctuations, the friction coefficient remains position independent for each specimen. It is, however, systematically influenced by fluorine concentration and top-layer thickness. Our data indicates that frictional energy dissipation extends up to 5 nm beneath the surface, demonstrating a clear dependence on subsurface structure. We attribute this to viscoelastic dissipation within the stress field and evanescent waves generated by the sliding tip, which can quantitatively account for the observed friction coefficients. These results show that, once adhesion is properly accounted for, the friction coefficient is a reproducible material property that can be tuned via controlled modifications to surface and subsurface layers.

Title: Revisiting the magnetic ground states of RECo$_5$ permanent magnets
Authors: F. de Almeida Passos, G. J. Nilsen, R. Dankelman, M. Thijs, G. Balakrishnan, S. Kumar, A. Thamizhavel, J. Larrea Jiménez
Abstract: In light of recent improvements in the theory of rare earth magnets, as well as the availability of improved neutron powder diffraction data on these materials, we revisit the magnetic single-ion properties of SmCo$_5$ and the magnetic structures of YCo$_5$ and NdCo$_5$. From neutron diffraction patterns in a wide range of temperatures between 3 K and 800 K, we obtain the thermal coefficient expansion and the magnetic moment values for the latter two materials. For SmCo$_5$, we fit existing neutron spectroscopy data with a model recently used for NdCo$_5$ to obtain the crystal field parameters, which are essential to determine the low-lying energy scales that set the Hamiltonian. Our results may trigger new experimental and theoretical studies towards a new route for the realization of permanent magnets.

Title: Hybrid magnon -- Nambu-Goldstone excitations in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator thin-film heterostructures
Authors: T. Karabassov, I. V. Bobkova, A. M. Bobkov, A. S. Vasenko, A. A. Golubov
Abstract: We address a previously unexplored type of dynamical proximity effect that occurs in s-wave topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) heterostructures. It is predicted that magnons in the FI and the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) collective superconducting phase mode in the TS are coupled, forming composite magnon-NG excitations. The mechanism of this coupling is associated with the complete spin-momentum locking of electrons in the helical surface state of the TS. The strength of the magnon-NG coupling is strongly anisotropic with respect to the mutual orientation of the magnon wave vector and the equilibrium magnetization of the FI. This effect provides a mechanism for the interconversion of spin signals and the spinless signals carried by collective superconducting excitations, thereby giving new impetus to the development of superconducting spintronics.

Title: Hybrid collective excitations in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures
Authors: T. Karabassov, I. V. Bobkova, A. M. Bobkov, A. S. Vasenko, A. A. Golubov
Abstract: We develop a linear response theory for the dynamical proximity effect in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) hybrid structures. Our approach combines the nonequilibrium quasiclassical Keldysh-Usadel equations for the electronic Green's functions in the TS with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation governing the magnetization dynamics in the FI. Within this framework, we study the proximity-induced coupling between magnons and superconducting collective excitations. We find that the spin-momentum locking intrinsic to the surface state of the TS leads to a hybridization between the superconducting Nambu-Goldstone (phase) collective mode and magnons, resulting in the emergence of composite magnon-Nambu-Goldstone excitations. The dependence of the coupling strength on relevant physical parameters is analyzed both analytically and numerically. In contrast, we show that the Higgs (amplitude) mode does not couple to magnons at linear order and therefore does not participate in the formation of hybrid collective excitations.

Title: Giant Shift Current in Electrically-Tunable Superlattice Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Nabil Atlam, Swati Chaudhary, Arpit Raj, Matthew Matzelle, Barun Ghosh, Gregory A. Fiete, Arun Bansil
Abstract: Recent introduction of superlattice potentials has opened new avenues for engineering tunable electronic band structures featuring topologically nontrivial moiré-like bands. Here we consider optoelectronic properties of Bernal-stacked graphene subjected to a superlattice potential either electrostatically or through lattice twisting to show that it exhibits a giant shift current response that is orders of magnitude larger than existing predictions in twisted mulitlayer systems. Effects of gate voltage and the strength and phase of the superlattice potential on the shift current are delineated systematically across various topological regimes. Our study gives insight into the nature of nonlinear responses of materials and how these responses could be optimized by tuning the superlattice potential.

Title: Magic angle (in)stability and mobility edges in disordered Chern insulators
Authors: Simon Becker, Izak Oltman, Martin Vogel
Abstract: Why do experiments only observe one magic angle in twisted bilayer graphene, despite standard models like the chiral limit of the Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian predicting an infinite number? In this article, we explore the relative stability of larger magic angles compared to smaller ones. Specifically, we analyze how disorder impacts these angles as described by the Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian in the chiral limit. Changing focus, we investigate the topological and transport properties of a specific magic angle under disorder. We identify a mobility edge near the flat band energy for small disorder, showing that this mobility edge persists even when all Chern numbers are zero. This persistence is attributed to the system's $C_{2z}T$ symmetry, which enables non-trivial sublattice transport. Notably, this effect remains robust beyond the chiral limit and near perfect magic angles, aligning with experimental observations.

Title: Certified algorithms for equilibrium states of local quantum Hamiltonians
Authors: Hamza Fawzi, Omar Fawzi, Samuel O. Scalet
Abstract: Predicting observables in equilibrium states is a central yet notoriously hard question in quantum many-body systems. In the physically relevant thermodynamic limit, certain mathematical formulations of this task have even been shown to result in undecidable problems. Using a finite-size scaling of algorithms devised for finite systems often fails due to the lack of certified convergence bounds for this limit. In this work, we design certified algorithms for computing expectation values of observables in the equilibrium states of local quantum Hamiltonians, both at zero and positive temperature. Importantly, our algorithms output rigorous lower and upper bounds on these values. This allows us to show that expectation values of local observables can be approximated in finite time, contrasting related undecidability results. When the Hamiltonian is commuting on a 2-dimensional lattice, we prove fast convergence of the hierarchy at high temperature and as a result for a desired precision $\varepsilon$, local observables can be approximated by a convex optimization program of quasi-polynomial size in $1/\varepsilon$.

Title: Open system dynamics from fundamental Lagrangian
Authors: Anirudh Gundhi, Oliviero Angeli, Angelo Bassi
Abstract: Lagrangians can differ by a total derivative without altering the equations of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is in general true both classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can lead to different physical predictions. We then discuss the criterion that allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the appropriate QED Lagrangian, we derive the master equation for the non-relativistic electron interacting with thermal photons upto second order in the interactions. This case study lends further phenomenological support to our proposed criterion.

Title: A Riemannian Approach to the Lindbladian Dynamics of a Locally Purified Tensor Network
Authors: Emiliano Godinez-Ramirez, Richard Milbradt, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: Tensor networks offer a valuable framework for implementing Lindbladian dynamics in many-body open quantum systems with nearest-neighbor couplings. In particular, a tensor network ansatz known as the Locally Purified Density Operator employs the local purification of the density matrix to guarantee the positivity of the state at all times. Within this framework, the dissipative evolution utilizes the Trotter-Suzuki splitting, yielding a second-order approximation error. However, due to the Lindbladian dynamics' nature, employing higher-order schemes results in non-physical quantum channels. In this work, we leverage the gauge freedom inherent in the Kraus representation of quantum channels to improve the splitting error. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem on the Riemannian manifold of isometries and find a solution via the second-order trust-region algorithm. We validate our approach using two nearest-neighbor noise models and achieve an improvement of orders of magnitude compared to other positivity-preserving schemes. In addition, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method as a compression scheme, helping to control the exponential growth of computational resources, which thus far has limited the use of the locally purified ansatz.

Title: A Random-Key Optimizer for Combinatorial Optimization
Authors: Antonio A. Chaves, Mauricio G.C. Resende, Martin J.A. Schuetz, J. Kyle Brubaker, Helmut G. Katzgraber, Edilson F. de Arruda, Ricardo M. A. Silva
Abstract: This paper introduces the Random-Key Optimizer (RKO), a versatile and efficient stochastic local search method tailored for combinatorial optimization problems. Using the random-key concept, RKO encodes solutions as vectors of random keys that are subsequently decoded into feasible solutions via problem-specific decoders. The RKO framework is able to combine a plethora of classic metaheuristics, each capable of operating independently or in parallel, with solution sharing facilitated through an elite solution pool. This modular approach allows for the adaptation of various metaheuristics, including simulated annealing, iterated local search, and greedy randomized adaptive search procedures, among others. The efficacy of the RKO framework, implemented in C++ and publicly available (Github public repository: this http URL), is demonstrated through its application to three NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems: the alpha-neighborhood p-median problem, the tree of hubs location problem, and the node-capacitated graph partitioning problem. The results highlight the framework's ability to produce high-quality solutions across diverse problem domains, underscoring its potential as a robust tool for combinatorial optimization.

Title: From Order to Chimeras: Unraveling Dynamic Patterns in Active Fluids with Nonlinear Growth
Authors: Joydeep Das, Abhishek Chaudhuri, Sudeshna Sinha
Abstract: We explore pattern formation in an active fluid system involving two chemical species that regulate active stress: a fast-diffusing species ($A$) and a slow-diffusing species ($I$). The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a nonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase diagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our findings indicate that an increase in the Péclet number results in the destabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively, an increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the homogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater asymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while low asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations conducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular, arrhythmic configurations at high Péclet numbers to both transient and robust symmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more prevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis indicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth parameters and moderately high Péclet numbers. Further, we also find soliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new aggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the phase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse array of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in a chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the nonlinear growth parameter is elevated.

Title: Efficient mutual magic and magic capacity with matrix product states
Authors: Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Tobias Haug
Abstract: Stabilizer Rényi entropies (SREs) probe the non-stabilizerness (or magic) of many-body systems and quantum computers. Here, we introduce the mutual von-Neumann SRE and magic capacity, which can be efficiently computed in time $O(N\chi^3)$ for matrix product states (MPSs) of bond dimension $\chi$. We find that mutual SRE characterizes the critical point of ground states of the transverse-field Ising model, independently of the chosen local basis. Then, we relate the magic capacity to the anti-flatness of the Pauli spectrum, which quantifies the complexity of computing SREs. The magic capacity characterizes transitions in the ground state of the Heisenberg and Ising model, randomness of Clifford+T circuits, and distinguishes typical and atypical states. Finally, we make progress on numerical techniques: we design two improved Monte-Carlo algorithms to compute the mutual $2$-SRE, overcoming limitations of previous approaches based on local update. We also give improved statevector simulation methods for Bell sampling and SREs with $O(8^{N/2})$ time and $O(2^N)$ memory, which we demonstrate for $24$ qubits. Our work uncovers improved approaches to study the complexity of quantum many-body systems.

Title: How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte
Authors: Vinay Thakur, Prabhat Prakash, Raghavan Ranganathan
Abstract: Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.

Title: Time-Independent Parameters in Quantum Systems: Revisiting Berry Phase, Curvature and Gauge Connections
Authors: Georgios Konstantinou
Abstract: We present a reformulation of quantum adiabatic theory in terms of an emergent electromagnetic framework, emphasizing the physical consequences of geometric structures in parameter space. Contrary to conventional approaches, we demonstrate that a Berry electric field naturally arises in systems with dynamic Hamiltonian, when the full time-dependent wavefunction is used to define the gauge potentials. This surprising result bridges the gap between static and dynamical formulations and leads to a deeper understanding of how gauge structures manifest in quantum systems. Building on this, we construct Berry Maxwell equations by analogy with classical electrodynamics, defining Berry electric and magnetic fields as derivatives of scalar and vector potentials obtained from the full quantum state. We verify these equations explicitly and derive field-theoretic identities such as generalized continuity and vorticity relations. This field-based formulation reveals the topological charges, monopole structures, and gauge currents that underlie parameter space, and clarifies how Berry curvature corrections enter dynamical quantities like expectation values and particle velocities. Our results establish a new regime of emergent electromagnetism in parameter space, unifying time-independent and time-dependent geometric phases within a covariant formalism. The implications extend to quantum transport, polarization, and topological classification of phases, providing a robust and generalizable framework for quantum systems driven by adiabatic or nonadiabatic evolution.

Title: Emergent Bifurcations in Quantum Circuit Stability from Hidden Parameter Statistics
Authors: Pilsung Kang
Abstract: The compression of quantum circuits is a foundational challenge for near-term quantum computing, yet the principles governing circuit stability remain poorly understood. We investigate this problem through a large-scale numerical analysis of 300 structurally-uniform circuits across 10, 12, and 14 qubits. Despite their macroscopic uniformity, we find that each ensemble universally bifurcates into distinct robust and fragile classes. We solve the puzzle of this emergent bifurcation, demonstrating that its origin is not structural, but is instead encoded in the statistical properties of the gate rotation parameters. Fragile circuits consistently exhibit a universal signature of ``statistical brittleness,'' characterized by low parameter variability and a scarcity of small-angle gates. We uncover the underlying physical mechanism for this phenomenon: Paradoxical Importance where smaller-angle gates are counter-intuitively more critical to the circuit's function, an effect most pronounced in fragile circuits. This reliance on fine-tuning explains why statistically brittle circuits are uniquely vulnerable to failure under compression. These findings establish a new framework for engineering resilient quantum algorithms, shifting the focus from macroscopic structure to the microscopic statistical properties of a circuit's parameters.

Title: Demonstration of an always-on exchange-only spin qubit
Authors: Joseph D. Broz, Jesse C. Hoke, Edwin Acuna, Jason R. Petta
Abstract: In conventional exchange-only (EO) spin qubit demonstrations, quantum gates have been implemented using sequences of individually pulsed pairwise exchange interactions with only one exchange coupling active at a time. Alternatively, multiple non-commuting exchange interactions can be pulsed simultaneously, reducing circuit depths and providing protection against leakage. We demonstrate high-fidelity quantum control of an always-on exchange-only (AEON) qubit, operated using simultaneous exchange pulses in a triangular quantum dot (QD) array. We use blind randomized benchmarking to characterize the performance of the full AEON single-qubit Clifford gate set, achieving an average Clifford gate fidelity $F_{\rm C1}$ = 99.86%. Extensions of this work may enable more efficient EO two-qubit entangling gates as well as the implementation of native $i$-Toffoli gates in Loss-DiVincenzo single-spin qubits.

Title: Measurement-Based Quantum Diffusion Models
Authors: Xinyu Liu, Jingze Zhuang, Wanda Hou, Yi-Zhuang You
Abstract: We introduce measurement-based quantum diffusion models that bridge classical and quantum diffusion theory through randomized weak measurements. The measurement-based approach naturally generates stochastic quantum trajectories while preserving purity at the trajectory level and inducing depolarization at the ensemble level. We address two quantum state generation problems: trajectory-level recovery of pure state ensembles and ensemble-average recovery of mixed states. For trajectory-level recovery, we establish that quantum score matching is mathematically equivalent to learning unitary generators for the reverse process. For ensemble-average recovery, we introduce local Petz recovery maps for states with finite correlation length and classical shadow reconstruction for general states, both with rigorous error bounds. Our framework establishes Petz recovery maps as quantum generalizations of reverse Fokker-Planck equations, providing a rigorous bridge between quantum recovery channels and classical stochastic reversals. This work enables new approaches to quantum state generation with potential applications in quantum information science.
