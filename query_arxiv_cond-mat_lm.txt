Title: Mixed Quantum-Classical Approaches to Spin Current and Polarization Dynamics in Chiral Molecular Junctions
Authors: Yu Wang, Ruihao Bi, Wei Liu, Jiayue Han, Wenjie Dou
Abstract: Chiral molecular junctions offer a promising platform for realizing chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where spin filtering occurs without external magnetic fields. Here, we investigate spin transport in such junctions by combining quantum master equation (QME) methods for purely electronic dynamics with surface hopping (SH) and mean-field Ehrenfest (MF) approaches to incorporate electron-phonon coupling. Our results show that transient spin polarization arises but ultimately decays to zero at long times. We find that bias voltage, molecular length, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strongly influence the spin current dynamics: higher bias enhances spin current but reduces polarization, while longer molecules and stronger SOC amplify transient polarization. Including electron-phonon coupling modifies current-voltage characteristics, enhancing spin currents at intermediate bias but suppressing them at high bias, while leaving the polarization dynamics largely unchanged. These findings highlight the interplay between electronic and vibrational effects in CISS and provide guidance for designing molecular spintronic devices.

Title: Theory of Sondheimer magneto-oscillations beyond semiclassical limit
Authors: Alexander Nikolaenko, Pavel A. Nosov
Abstract: In conducting films subjected to an out-of-plane magnetic field, electron motion along the field direction gives rise to conductance oscillations periodic in field intensity - a phenomenon known as Sondheimer oscillations. Traditionally, these oscillations were understood within the semiclassical framework of kinetic theory. However, their behavior in the quantum regime (i.e. at strong fields and weak disorder) remains unclear, particularly due to potential interference with quantum Shubnikov-de Haas magneto-oscillations. In this work, we develop a comprehensive theory of quantum magnetoconductivity oscillations in metallic films of finite thickness, fully capturing the interplay between the Sondheimer and Shubnikov-de Haas effects beyond the semiclassical limit. By treating surface scattering, in-plane Landau quantization, and dimensional confinement along the magnetic field direction on equal footing, we reveal an intricate hierarchy of oscillation patterns and characterize how their amplitudes and frequencies depend on various physical parameters. Our results pave the way for systematic characterization of thin metallic films with boundary-dominated transport properties.

Title: Stress Response of Jammed Solids: Prestress and Screening
Authors: Surajit Chakraborty, Jishnu N. Nampoothiri, Subhro Bhattacharjee, Bulbul Chakraborty, Kabir Ramola
Abstract: Unlike classical elasticity, where stresses arise from deformations relative to a stress-free reference configuration, rigidity in amorphous systems is maintained by disordered force networks that generate internal prestress. Previously, we introduced a ''stress-only'' formulation, where mechanical equilibrium resembles Gauss's law in a rank-2 tensor electrostatics with vector charges, and demonstrated that the mechanical response of jammed solids is described by the dielectric response of this gauge-theoretic formulation. Here, we extend this framework by incorporating scale-dependent screening that captures both dielectric and Debye-type behaviour. This introduces a characteristic length scale in stress correlations as well as in the response to external forces. Through numerical simulations of soft-sphere packings, we show that this length scale is set by the particle size, thus providing a natural ultraviolet cutoff while preserving long-wavelength emergent elasticity. We show that this lengthscale remains finite for all pressures, with no evidence for an emergent Debye-like screening near the frictionless unjamming transition. We demonstrate that although individual realisations show strong fluctuations, disorder averaging at fixed macroscopic conditions yields a robust dielectric-like response that persists up to unjamming. Finally, we also provide a physical interpretation of the gauge field within the electrostatic mapping: relative grain displacements in response to localised external perturbations correspond to difference in the gauge field, linking the field-theoretic description to particle-level mechanics.

Title: Defects in Wigner crystals: fracton-elasticity duality and vacancy proliferation
Authors: Paweł Matus
Abstract: We develop a low-energy field theory for electrically charged crystals. Using the tools of fracton-elasticity duality, generalized to accommodate the magnetic 1-form symmetry of electromagnetism, we show how the elastic and electromagnetic degrees of freedom couple to the different crystal defects and to one another. The resulting field theory is then used to calculate vacancy-vacancy interaction energy, and to study the consequences of vacancy proliferation. We find that the longitudinal mode, which in a perfect crystal has a finite gap due to plasma oscillations, becomes gapless in the presence of vacancies. Our framework lays a foundation for a study of defect interactions, their collective dynamics, and consequences of defect-mediated melting in charged crystals.

Title: Thermodynamic constraints and pseudotransition behavior in a one-dimensional water-like system
Authors: F. F. Braz, S. M. de Souza, M. L. Lyra, Onofre Rojas
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional water-like lattice model with Van der Waals and hydrogen-bond interactions, allowing for particle number fluctuations through a chemical potential. The model, defined on a chain with periodic boundary conditions, exhibits three ground-state phases: gas, bonded liquid, and dense liquid, separated by sharp phase boundaries in the chemical potential and temperature plane. Using the transfer matrix method, we derive exact analytical results within the grand-canonical ensemble and examine the finite-temperature behavior. The system exhibits clear pseudotransition features, including sharp but analytic changes in entropy, density, and internal energy, along with finite peaks in specific heat and correlation length. To assess the role of thermodynamic constraints, we consider the behavior under fixed density through a Legendre transformation. This constrained analysis reveals smoother anomalies, such as entropy kinks and finite jumps in specific heat, contrasting with the sharper grand-canonical signatures. These results underscore the ensemble dependence of pseudotransitions and show how statistical constraints modulate critical-like behavior. We also verify that the residual entropy continuity criterion holds in the grand-canonical ensemble but is violated when the system is constrained. Our findings illustrate how even a simple one-dimensional model can mimic water-like thermodynamic anomalies.

Title: How Microplastics cross the Buoyancy Barrier: A multi-scale Study
Authors: Thomas Witzmann, Anja F. R. M. Ramsperger, Hao Liu, Yifan Lu, Holger Schmalz, Lucas Kurzweg, Tom C. D. Börner, Kathrin Harre, Andreas Greiner, Christian Laforsch, Holger Kress, Christina Bogner, Stephan Gekle, Andreas Fery, Günter K. Auernhammer
Abstract: Microplastics (MPs), though less dense than water, are frequently recovered from sediments in aqueous environments, indicating they can cross the buoyancy barrier. We quantify eco-corona mediated MP-sediment attraction and MP transport from the nanoscale to the macroscale, linking all scales to a coherent mechanism explaining how MP overcome buoyancy and settle in sediments through interaction with suspended sediment. Colloidal probe atomic force microscopy (CP-AFM) detected attractive forces (0.15 - 17 mN/m) enabling heteroaggregation. Microscale tests confirmed aggregation and on larger scales sediment retention more than doubled with an eco-corona. Simulations showed that environmental shear force ($4 \cdot 10^{-4} mN/m$) cannot disrupt aggregates. In sedimentation columns, biofilm-covered MPs settled twice as often as plain MPs in bentonite suspensions. MP retention increased by 32 %. These results demonstrate that eco-corona/biofilm-mediated heteroaggregation is a robust pathway for MP sinking, accumulation, and retention in sediment beds. By identifying physical interaction thresholds and aggregation stability, we provide mechanistic insight into MP fate, highlight probable accumulation hotspots, and offer an evidence base for improved risk assessment and environmental modelling.

Title: General approach for partitioning and phase separation in macromolecular coexisting phases
Authors: Vikki Anand Varma, Alberto Scacchi
Abstract: Partitioning of (bio)materials in polymeric mixtures is a key phenomenon both in cellular environments, as well as in industrial applications. In cells, several macromolecules are suspended within different biomolecular phases. On the other hand, the coexistence of polymeric aqueous phases has been exploited for the extraction and purification of (bio)materials suspended in water. Despite its relevance, key physical and chemical properties controlling the phase behavior of these complex systems are still lacking. Here, we have developed a classical density functional theory approach for describing the phase coexistence and partitioning of an arbitrary number of polymers and suspended materials. As a case example, we focus on a binary mixture of phase separating polymers in which a third material is dispersed. We explore the effect of size ratios and affinities between the different materials and address their distribution and coexisting densities, and find optimal conditions for partitioning.

Title: Quenched properties of the Spectral Form Factor
Authors: Dimitrios Charamis, Manas Kulkarni, Jorge Kurchan, Laura Foini
Abstract: The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.

Title: Deep Gaussian Process-based Cost-Aware Batch Bayesian Optimization for Complex Materials Design Campaigns
Authors: Sk Md Ahnaf Akif Alvi, Brent Vela, Vahid Attari, Jan Janssen, Danny Perez, Douglas Allaire, Raymundo Arroyave
Abstract: The accelerating pace and expanding scope of materials discovery demand optimization frameworks that efficiently navigate vast, nonlinear design spaces while judiciously allocating limited evaluation resources. We present a cost-aware, batch Bayesian optimization scheme powered by deep Gaussian process (DGP) surrogates and a heterotopic querying strategy. Our DGP surrogate, formed by stacking GP layers, models complex hierarchical relationships among high-dimensional compositional features and captures correlations across multiple target properties, propagating uncertainty through successive layers. We integrate evaluation cost into an upper-confidence-bound acquisition extension, which, together with heterotopic querying, proposes small batches of candidates in parallel, balancing exploration of under-characterized regions with exploitation of high-mean, low-variance predictions across correlated properties. Applied to refractory high-entropy alloys for high-temperature applications, our framework converges to optimal formulations in fewer iterations with cost-aware queries than conventional GP-based BO, highlighting the value of deep, uncertainty-aware, cost-sensitive strategies in materials campaigns.

Title: Gravity-driven flux of particles through apertures
Authors: Ram Sudhir Sharma, Alexandre Leonelli, Kevin Zhao, Eckart Meiburg, Alban Sauret
Abstract: The gravity-driven discharge of granular material through an aperture is a fundamental problem in granular physics and is classically described by empirical laws with different fitting parameters. In this Letter, we disentangle the mass flux into distinct velocity and packing contributions by combining three-dimensional experiments and simulations. We define a dimensionless flux ratio that captures confinement-driven deviations from a free-fall limit, which is recovered when the aperture is large compared to the grain size. For spherical cohesionless grains, the deviations from the free-fall limit are captured by a single exponential correction factor over a characteristic length scale of $\sim$ 10-15 grain diameters. This is shown to be the scale over which the packing structure is modified due to the boundary. We propose a new kinematic framework that explains the universality of granular discharge beyond empirical descriptions.

Title: Dynamics of an outlier in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble
Authors: John Mateus, Gabriel Téllez, Frédéric van Wijland
Abstract: We endow the elements of a random matrix drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble with a Dyson Brownian motion dynamics. We initialize the dynamics of the eigenvalues with all of them lumped at the origin, but one outlier. We solve the dynamics exactly which gives us a window on the dynamical scaling behavior at and around the Baik-Ben Arous-Péché transition. Amusingly, while the statics is well-known and accessible via the Hikami-Brézin integrals, our approach for the dynamics is explicitly based on the use of orthogonal polynomials.

Title: On the equivalence and optimality of transformations of diffusive systems
Authors: Davide Gabrielli, Giovanni Jona-Lasinio
Abstract: In this paper we introduce, inspired by Clausius and developing the ideas of \cite{pre}, the concept of equivalence of transformations in non equilibrium theory of diffusive systems within the framework of macroscopic fluctuation theory. Besides providing a new proof of a formula derived in \cite{mft,qc}, which is the basis of the equivalence, we show that equivalent quasistatic transformations can be distinguished in finite terms, by the renormalized work introduced in \cite{45,46,mft,qc}. This allows us to tackle the problem of determining the optimal quasistatic transformation among the equivalent ones.

Title: Density Dependence of the Phases of the $ν= 1$ Integer Quantum Hall Plateau in Low Disorder Electron Gases
Authors: Haoyun Huang, Waseem Hussain, S.A. Myers, L.N. Pfeiffer, K.W. West, G.A. Csáthy
Abstract: Recent magnetotransport measurements in low-disorder electron systems confined to GaAs/AlGaAs samples revealed that the $\nu = 1$ integer quantum Hall plateau is broken into three distinct regions. These three regions were associated with two phases with different types of bulk localization: the Anderson insulator is due to random quasiparticle localization, and the integer quantum Hall Wigner solid is due to pinning of a stiff quasiparticle lattice. We highlight universal properties of the $\nu = 1$ plateau: the structure of the stability diagram, the non-monotonic dependence of the activation energy on the filling factor, and the alignment of features of the activation energy with features of the stability regions of the different phases are found to be similar in three samples spanning a wide range of electron densities. We also discuss quantitative differences between the samples, such as the dependence of the onset temperature and the activation energy of the integer quantum Hall Wigner solid on the electron density. Our findings provide insights into the localization behavior along the $\nu = 1$ integer quantum Hall plateau in the low disorder regime.

Title: The Varieties of Schelling Model Experience
Authors: Marlyn Boke, Timothy Sorochkin, Jesse Anttila-Hughes, Alan O. Jamison
Abstract: The Schelling model is a prototype for agent-based modeling in social systems. A comprehensive analysis of Schelling model rule variants is achieved by classification of the space of macroscopic outcomes via phase diagrams. Among 54 rule variants, only 3 phase diagram classes are found, characterized by the number of phase transitions. This classification scheme is found to be robust to the use of sociological and percolation-inspired measures of segregation. The statistical and dynamic drivers of these transitions are elucidated by analyzing the roles of vision, movement criteria, vacancies, the initial state, and rivalry. Schelling's original step function dictating satisfaction is found to be pathological at high thresholds, producing coordination failures as satisfactory sites become increasingly rare. This comprehensive classification gives new insight into the drivers of transitions in the Schelling model and creates a basis for studying more complex Schelling-like models.

Title: Mixed order phase transition in a locally constrained exclusion process
Authors: Gunter Schutz, Ali Zahra
Abstract: We investigate a novel variant of the exclusion process in which particles perform asymmetric nearest-neighbor jumps across a bond \((k, k+1)\) only if the preceding site \((k-1)\) is unoccupied. This next-nearest-neighbor constraint significantly enriches the system's dynamics, giving rise to long-range correlations and a mixed-order transition controlled by the asymmetry parameter. We focus on the critical case of half filling, where the system splits into two ergodic components, each associated with an invariant reversible measure. The combinatorial structure of this equilibrium distribution is intimately connected to the \(q\)-Catalan numbers, enabling us to derive rigorously the asymptotic behavior of key thermodynamic quantities in the strongly asymmetric regime and to conjecture their behavior in the weakly asymmetric limit. Even though the system is one-dimensional and has short-range interactions, an equilibrium phase transition occurs between a clustered phase -- characterized by slow dynamics, long-range correlations with thermodynamic additivity, and spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry -- and a fluid phase where the correlations are short-range and which is thermodynamically additive. This equilibrium phase transition features characteristics of a first-order transition, such as a discontinuous order parameter as well as characteristics of a second-order transition, namely a divergent susceptibility at the transition point. We also briefly discuss density higher than one half where ergodicity is broken.

Title: Coupled Interfacial Phenomena Suppress Propulsion in Catalytic Janus Colloids
Authors: Muhammad Haroon, Christopher Wirth
Abstract: Platinum-coated polystyrene Janus particles exhibit a combination of stochastic and deterministic motion in hydrogen peroxide solutions, making them promising candidates for applications in micro-scale cargo transport, drug delivery, and environmental remediation. The dynamics of Janus particles very near a boundary are dictated by conservative and non-conservative interactions that depend on particle, substrate, and solution properties. This study investigated the influence of orientational quenching by measuring the effect of changes in cap thickness and hydrogen peroxide concentration on particle velocity and maximum displacement. Janus particles with cap thicknesses of 3 nm, 7 nm, 10 nm, 20 nm, and 35 nm were analyzed in 1 wt./vol.% and 3 wt./vol.% hydrogen peroxide solutions near the bottom and top boundaries of the fluid cell. Results indicated that particles with lower cap thicknesses exhibit higher velocities, with faster particles in 3 wt./vol.% peroxide as compared to 1 wt./vol.% peroxide. Furthermore, results suggest a combined influence of activity and gravitational effects influenced whether particles moved along the top boundary i.e. ceiling or bottom boundary i.e. flooring. Heavier cap particles in lower peroxide concentration solution show less ceiling than lighter cap particles in higher peroxide concentration. We also find a global reduction in velocity for when a single surface of the two is plasma cleaned surface. These findings highlight the important interplay between cap weight, hydrodynamic interactions, and propulsion force in determining the dynamics of Janus particles.

Title: Dipole condensates in synthetic rank-2 electric fields
Authors: Jiali Zhang, Wenhui Xu, Qi Zhou, Shaoliang Zhang
Abstract: Dipole condensates, formed from particle-hole pairs, represent a unique class of charge-neutral quantum fluids that evade conventional vector gauge fields, making their electrodynamic responses difficult to probe in natural materials. Here, we propose a tunable platform using strongly interacting two-component ultracold atoms to realize dipole condensates and probe their coupling to rank-2 electric fields. By applying spin-dependent forces and treating spin as a synthetic dimension, we engineer a synthetic rank-2 electric field that induces measurable electrodynamic responses. We identify the atomic analog of perfect Coulomb drag: increasing intercomponent interactions leads to equal and opposite displacements of the centers of mass of the two spin components. Furthermore, a rank-2 electric field imprints a phase twist in the dipole condensate and generates a supercurrent of dipoles that obeys the dipolar Josephson relation -- a smoking gun for dipole condensation. Our results establish a powerful platform for exploring dipolar superfluidity under tensor gauge fields.

Title: Data coarse graining can improve model performance
Authors: Alex Nguyen, David J. Schwab, Vudtiwat Ngampruetikorn
Abstract: Lossy data transformations by definition lose information. Yet, in modern machine learning, methods like data pruning and lossy data augmentation can help improve generalization performance. We study this paradox using a solvable model of high-dimensional, ridge-regularized linear regression under 'data coarse graining.' Inspired by the renormalization group in statistical physics, we analyze coarse-graining schemes that systematically discard features based on their relevance to the learning task. Our results reveal a nonmonotonic dependence of the prediction risk on the degree of coarse graining. A 'high-pass' scheme--which filters out less relevant, lower-signal features--can help models generalize better. By contrast, a 'low-pass' scheme that integrates out more relevant, higher-signal features is purely detrimental. Crucially, using optimal regularization, we demonstrate that this nonmonotonicity is a distinct effect of data coarse graining and not an artifact of double descent. Our framework offers a clear, analytical explanation for why careful data augmentation works: it strips away less relevant degrees of freedom and isolates more predictive signals. Our results highlight a complex, nonmonotonic risk landscape shaped by the structure of the data, and illustrate how ideas from statistical physics provide a principled lens for understanding modern machine learning phenomena.

Title: Laughlin charge pumping from interplay of chiral Dirac and chiral Majorana modes
Authors: Zhan Cao, Yang Feng, Zhi-Hai Liu, Ke He
Abstract: Laughlin charge pumping has provided critical insights into the topological classification of individual materials, but remains largely unexplored in topological junctions. We explore Laughlin charge pumping in junctions composed of a chiral topological superconductor sandwiched between two quantum anomalous Hall insulators, driven by an adiabatically varying magnetic flux. Here, charge pumping can be mediated merely by chiral Dirac modes or by the interplay of chiral Dirac and chiral Majorana modes (CMMs). In the former case, a variation of one magnetic flux quantum induces the pumping of a unit charge, as the chiral Dirac mode accumulates the full flux-induced phase. In contrast, in the latter case, pumping a unit charge requires a variation of fractional magnetic flux quanta, determined by the device geometry and the parity of the number of enclosed superconducting vortices. This unique feature results from the charge-neutral and zero-momentum nature of zero-energy CMMs. Our work offers an experimentally viable pathway toward detecting CMMs and could also inspire further research into Laughlin charge or spin pumping in diverse topological junctions, which are now within experimental reach.

Title: Data-driven discovery of governing equation for sheared granular materials in steady and transient states
Authors: Xu Han, Lu Jing, Chung-Yee Kwok, Gengchao Yang, Yuri Dumaresq Sobral
Abstract: Granular material has significant implications for industrial and geophysical processes. A long-lasting challenge, however, is seeking a unified rheology for its solid- and liquid-like behaviors under quasi-static, inertial, and even unsteady shear conditions. Here, we present a data-driven framework to discover the hidden governing equation of sheared granular materials. The framework, PINNSR-DA, addresses noisy discrete particle data via physics-informed neural networks with sparse regression (PINNSR) and ensures dimensional consistency via machine learning-based dimensional analysis (DA). Applying PINNSR-DA to our discrete element method simulations of oscillatory shear flow, a general differential equation is found to govern the effective friction across steady and transient states. The equation consists of three interpretable terms, accounting respectively for linear response, nonlinear response and energy dissipation of the granular system, and the coefficients depends primarily on a dimensionless relaxation time, which is shorter for stiffer particles and thicker flow layers. This work pioneers a pathway for discovering physically interpretable governing laws in granular systems and can be readily extended to more complex scenarios involving jamming, segregation, and fluid-particle interactions.

Title: Controlled Polarization Switch in a Polariton Josephson Junction
Authors: Valeria A. Maslova, Nina S. Voronova
Abstract: The interaction between a particle's spin and momentum -- known as spin-orbit (SO) coupling -- is the cornerstone of modern spintronics. In Bose-Einsten condensates of ultracold atoms, SO coupling can be implemented and precisely controlled experimentally; photonic systems, on the other hand, possess an intrinsic SO interaction due to the longitudinal-transverse splitting of the photon modes. In this work, we focus on such spinor, SO-coupled exciton-polariton condensates on a ring, where the strength of the synthetic magnetic field is controlled by the geometrical dimensions of the structure. Inspired by recent experiments, we investigate the dynamics of a weakly-nonlinear four-mode bosonic Josephson junction within this geometry. We discover a narrow parameter range in which the interplay of the tunneling dynamics with polariton-specific SO coupling leads to a new regime, with dynamical switching of the fluid's circular polarization degree to the opposite, along the entire ring or on just one of its halves. Our results demonstrate polariton condensates in ring configurations as excellent candidates for all-optical controllable spin-switch applications, with prospects for scalability and observing non-trivial polarization patterns.

Title: S1-MatAgent: A planner driven multi-agent system for material discovery
Authors: Xinrui Wang, Chengbo Li, Boxuan Zhang, Jiahui Shi, Nian Ran, Linjing Li, Jianjun Liu, Dajun Zeng
Abstract: The discovery of high-performance materials is crucial for technological advancement. Inverse design using multi-agent systems (MAS) shows great potential for new material discovery. However, current MAS for materials research rely on predefined configurations and tools, limiting their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we developed a planner driven multi-agent system (S1-MatAgent) which adopts a Planner-Executor architecture. Planner automatically decomposes complex materials design tasks, dynamically configures various tools to generate dedicated Executor agents for each subtask, significantly reducing reliance on manual workflow construction and specialized configuration. Applied to high-entropy alloy catalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions in alkaline conditions, S1-MatAgent completed full-cycle closed-loop design from literature analysis and composition recommendation to performance optimization and experimental validation. To tackle the deviations between designed materials and target, as well as high experimental verification costs, S1-MatAgent employs a novel composition optimization algorithm based on gradients of machine learning interatomic potential, achieving 27.7 % improvement in material performance. S1-MatAgent designed 13 high-performance catalysts from 20 million candidates, with Ni4Co4Cu1Mo3Ru4 exhibiting an overpotential of 18.6 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and maintaining 97.5 % activity after 500 hours at 500 mA cm-2. The universal MAS framework offers a universal and scalable solution for material discovery, significantly improving design efficiency and adaptability.

Title: Density Functional Theory Analysis of Na3AgO: Assessing its Viability as a Sustainable Material for Solar Energy Applications
Authors: Vipan Kumar, Shyam Lal Gupta, Sumit Kumar, Ashwani Kumar, Pooja Rana, Diwaker
Abstract: This study mainly emphasis the fascinating features of inverse perovskites Na3AgO using density functional theory (DFT). Inverse perovskite (IP) Na3AgO structural features have been examined, and the space group and cubic structure of Pm-3m (221) have been confirmed. The experimental formulation and thermal stability of IP have been confirmed by the formation energy. Phonon dispersion curves were used to assess dynamic stability. The dynamic stability of the examined IP and the bonding strength against cubic structure deformation are confirmed by the lack of negative frequencies. The energy gap or the characteristics of semiconducting behaviour have been predicted by the electronic properties of Na3AgO with a band gap of 1.273 eV. In order to confirmthe viability of solar cells, the light-dependent properties have also been identified. Born stability criteria are also used to verify the mechanical stability, and additional elastic characteristics are identified in order to forecast the anisotropy, ductility, strength, and hardness. These anti-perovskites, which possess intriguing characteristics, have the potential to be effective materials for photovoltaic applications, as indicated by the analysed findings.

Title: Violation of Spin Paramagnetic limit in Bi/Ni Bilayer
Authors: Gabriel Sant'Ana, Leonardo Pessoa da Silva, Pedro Schio, David Möckli, Jan Aarts, Kaveh Lahabi, Milton A. Tumelero
Abstract: We report a violation of the spin-paramagnetic limit in the in-plane upper critical field ($B_{C2}^{\parallel}$) in Bi(10 nm)/Ni(1 nm) bilayers grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Superconductivity emerges at the interface through the formation of an ultrathin NiBi$_3$ layer, which hosts a remarkably robust superconducting state under in-plane magnetic fields. To account for the $B_{C2}^{\parallel}$ enhancement, we evaluate two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity models incorporating spin-orbit scattering and Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling. However, none of these mechanisms fully capture the observed behavior. We discuss the potential role of unconventional pairing, possibly linked to spin fluctuations. Our findings suggest that, in the 2D limit, NiBi$_3$ may support a superconducting state beyond the standard spin-singlet framework.

Title: Emergent momentum-space topological pseudospin defects in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Yow-Ming Robin Hu, Elena A. Ostrovskaya, Alexander Yakimenko, Eliezer Estrecho
Abstract: Topological defects are central to modern physics, from spintronics to photonics, due to their robustness and potential application in information processing. In this work, we discuss topological point defects that spontaneously emerge at the imaginary Fermi arcs (degeneracy lines) in momentum space of two-dimensional systems described by non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians. In particular, we consider a generic non-Hermitian Dirac model and a phenomenological model describing hybrid light-matter quasiparticles - exciton polaritons hosted in an optical microcavity. In both cases, the eigenenergies of the system have both real and imaginary parts and form two distinct bands corresponding to two (pseudo-)spin states. We describe the trajectories of the point defects characterized by integer-valued topological winding (vorticity) analytically and show that the defects with opposite vorticity annihilate with each other in the fully gapped phases, but are protected from annihilation by the non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies (exceptional and hybrid points) in the gapless phases. We also suggest that the signatures of these defects can be experimentally measured in an exciton-polariton system.

Title: Rotational dynamics of bound pairs of bacteria-induced membrane tubes
Authors: Makarand Diwe, P B Sunil Kumar, Pramod Pullarkat
Abstract: We present experiments demonstrating tube formation in giant unilamellar vesicles that are suspended in a bath of swimming E. coli bacteria. We chose the lipids such that the bacteria have no adhereing interaction with the membrane. The tubes are generated by the pushing force exerted by the bacteria on the membrane of the vesicles. Once generated, the bacteria are confined within the tubes, resulting in long-lived tubes that protrude into the vesicle. We show that such tubes interact to form stable bound pairs that orbit each other. We speculate that the tubes are maintained by the persistent pushing force generated by the bacterium, and the rotating pairs are stabilized by a combination of curvature mediated interaction and vorticity generated in the membrane by the rotation of the flagella.

Title: Thermal rectification in jointless Pb solid wire
Authors: Masayuki Mashiko, Poonam Rani, Yuto Watanabe, Yoshikazu Mizuguchi
Abstract: Thermal rectification is observed in jointless Pb wires at temperatures near the superconducting transition of Pb under magnetic fields. Using different magnetic-field (H) response of temperature dependence of thermal conductivity (\k{appa}-T) under H parallel to J and H perpendicular to J where J is heat flow, we fabricated a jointless thermal diode. Thermal rectification is observed with the thermal rectification ratio (TRR) of 1.5 and the difference in \k{appa} of 330 W m-1 K-1 at T = 5.11 K under H = 400 Oe for a Pb wire with a 50%-bent (H perpendicular to J) and 50%-straight (H parallel to J) structure. The peak temperature of TRR can be tuned by the strength of applied magnetic field. By changing bent ratio to 40%-bent, a higher TRR exceeding 2 was observed. The Pb-jointless thermal diode will be a useful material for thermal management at cryogenic temperatures.

Title: Zero-energy resonances in ultracold hydrogen sticking to liquid helium films of finite thickness
Authors: R. Karahanyan, A. Voronin, V. Nesvizhevsky, A. Semakin, S. Vasiliev
Abstract: We investigated quantum states of ultracold hydrogen atoms in a combined potential comprising the H-He film interaction in the presence of a substrate and the Earth gravitational field. We show that the shift and width of the gravitational quantum states are determined by the complex scattering length for the H-He film-substrate potential. We demonstrate that for specific helium film thicknesses above a substrate, zero-energy resonances occur if the combined potential supports a bound state exactly at the threshold. This effect leads to a complete restructuring of the bound states spectrum. The dynamics of gravitational levels as a function of the van der Waals interaction depth controlled by the helium film thickness is analyzed. It reveals the critical thicknesses at about 6.1 and 1.8 nm, at which resonances appear in the case of the conductive substrate. With imaginary integral operators, we incorporate non-perturbatively the inelastic effects originating from the ripplon coupling. The inelastic effects show dramatic changes in the sticking-coefficient behavior near the critical points. The enhanced sticking coefficients provide a probe for studying critical phenomena and measuring atom-surface interaction parameters with unprecedented sensitivity.

Title: Three-Dimensional Domain-Wall Membranes
Authors: Jacob Mankenberg, Artem Abanov
Abstract: Three-dimensional magnetic textures, such as Hopfions, torons, and skyrmion tubes, possess rich geometric and topological structure, but their detailed energetics, deformation modes, and collective behavior are yet to be fully understood. In this work, we develop an effective geometric theory for general three-dimensional textures by representing them as embedded two-dimensional orientable domain-wall membranes. Using a local ansatz for the magnetization in terms of membrane coordinates, we integrate out the internal domain-wall profile to obtain a reduced two-dimensional energy functional. This functional captures the coupling between curvature, topology, and the interplay of micromagnetic energies, and is expressed in terms of a small set of soft-mode fields: the local wall thickness and in-plane magnetization angle. Additionally, we construct a local formula for the Hopf index which sheds light on the coupling between geometry and topology for nontrivial textures. We analyze the general properties of the theory and demonstrate its utility through the example of a flat membrane hosting a vortex as well as a toroidal Hopfion, obtaining analytic solutions for the wall thickness profile, associated energetics, and a confirmation of the Hopf index formula. The framework naturally extends to more complex geometries and can accommodate additional interactions such as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, Zeeman, and other anisotropies, making it a versatile tool for exploring the interplay between geometry, topology, and micromagnetics in three-dimensional spin systems.

Title: Intrinsic characteristic radius drives phonon anomalies in Janus transition metal dichalcogenide nanotubes
Authors: Jing-Jing Zhang, Jin-Wu Jiang
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides and their derivatives offer a versatile platform for exploring novel structural and functional properties in low-dimensional materials. In particular, Janus monolayers possess an intrinsic out-of-plane asymmetry that induces a built-in bending radius, which can strongly influence their physical behavior. In this work, we investigate the tubular structures formed by rolling Janus monolayers into the Janus nanotube with an extrinsic radius. Using a combination of atomistic simulations and continuum mechanics, we identify that the total energy of the Janus nanotube is minimized when the tube radius equals to the intrinsic bending radius of the Janus monolayer. An analytical expression for this characteristic radius is derived, providing a theoretical basis for understanding the stability of Janus nanotubes. Furthermore, we find that the optical phonon modes in these Janus nanotubes exhibit an anomalous dependence on the tube radius; i.e., their frequencies reach a maximum value near the characteristic radius, in contrast to the monotonic increase of optical phonon frequencies with radius in conventional nanotubes. The phonon anomaly is due to the soft phonon mode effect induced by the deviation from the most stable tubular configuration with the characteristic radius. These results uncover a unique coupling between intrinsic and extrinsic curvature in Janus systems and open new pathways for tuning vibrational and other properties in curved low-dimensional materials.

Title: Chiral twist-bend liquid crystals
Authors: E.I.Kats
Abstract: Recently published preprint ( A. Ashkinazi, this http URL, this http URL, this http URL, J.P.K. Doye, ''Chirality transfer in lyotropic twist-bend nematics'', arXiv:2508.03544v1 (2025)) has reawakened also interest to various mechanisms of chirality transfer from microscopic (molecular) level into the macroscopic chirality of the structure. In this communication we present a simple theoretical analysis how the transfer occurs for the Landau model of phase transition between cholesteric and chiral twist-bend liquid crystals. We found that the sign of the chiral heliconical spiral is always opposite to that of the cholesteric. Physics behind this relation is based on the orthogonality of the cholesteric director and vector order parameter of the heliconical phase.

Title: A General Model for Static Contact Angles
Authors: Carlos E Colosqui
Abstract: The problem of contact angle and hysteresis determination has direct implications for engineering applications of wetting, colloid and surface science. Significant technical challenges can arise under real-world operating conditions, because the static contact angle is strongly influenced by contamination at the liquid-solid and liquid-vapor interfaces, chemical aging over long times, and environmental variables such as relative humidity and temperature. Analytical models that account for these real-world effects are therefore highly desirable to guide the rational design of robust applications. This work proposes a unified and simple-to-use model that expands Young's local thermodynamic approach to consider surfaces with topographic features of general geometry and varying degrees of liquid infiltration. The unified model recovers classical wetting limits (Wenzel, Cassie-Baxter, and hemiwicking), accounts for observable intermediate states (e.g., impregnating Cassie), and identifies a new limiting state with potential realizability: a Cassie state accompanied by a precursor film, termed the Inverse Wenzel state.

Title: Multiple many-body localization transitions in a driven non-Hermitian quasiperiodic chain
Authors: Sanchayan Banerjee, Ayan Banerjee, Tapan Mishra, Flore K. Kunst
Abstract: We investigate the fate of a many-body localized phase in a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic model of hardcore bosons subjected to periodic driving. While in general, the many-body localized system is known to thermalize with increasing driving period due to Floquet heating, in this case, we demonstrate that the initially localized system first delocalizes and then localizes again, resulting in a re-entrant many-body localization (MBL) transition as a function of the driving period. Strikingly, further increase in the driving period results in a series of localization-delocalization transitions leaving behind traces of extended regimes (islands) in between MBL phases. Furthermore, non-Hermiticity renders the extended islands boundary-sensitive, resulting in a Floquet many-body skin effect under open boundaries. We present numerical evidence from spectral and dynamic studies, confirming these findings. Our study opens new pathways for understanding the interplay between non-Hermiticity and quasiperiodicity in driven systems.

Title: Cost Reduction in Spin-dependent Stochastic GW Calculations
Authors: Xuance Jiang, Vojtech Vlcek
Abstract: We extend the stochastic GW (sGW) formalism to fully spin-polarized systems, encompassing both collinear and non-collinear spin configurations. For non-collinear systems-where Kohn-Sham states are complex two-component spinors-we develop a complex-valued stochastic basis that preserves the real-valued external stochastic charge applied at time zero. This basis enables an unbiased evaluation of the random-phase approximation (RPA) screened interaction for spinors. Through error analysis and tests on real materials, we show that the performance of collinear sGW retains the same time complexity as the spin-unpolarized sGW . The non-collinear sGW incurs a computational cost two to three times higher than the spin-unpolarized version, while preserving linear scaling with low multiplicity. By unifying collinear and non-collinear treatments within a single scalable framework, our work paves the way for routine many-body predictions in large scale magnetic and spin-orbit-coupled material systems.

Title: Computational uncertainties in lattice thermal conductivity prediction of crystalline solids
Authors: Yagyank Srivastava, Amey G. Gokhale, Ankit Jain
Abstract: We report computational uncertainties in Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE)-based lattice thermal conductivity prediction of 50 diverse semiconductors from the use of different BTE solvers (ShengBTE, Phono3Py, and in-house code) and interatomic forces. The interatomic forces are obtained either using the density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in packages Quantum Espresso and VASP employing commonly used exchange correlation functionals (PBE, LDA, PBEsol, and rSCAN) or using the pre-trained foundational machine learning forcefields trained on two different material datasets. We find that the considered BTE solvers introduce minimal uncertainties and, using the same interatomic force constants, all solvers result in an excellent agreement with each other, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of only 1%. While this error increases to around 10% with the use of different DFT packages, the error is still small and can be reduced further with the use of stringent planewave energy cutoffs. On the other hand, the differences in thermal conductivity due to the use of different exchange correlation functionals are large, with a MAPE of more than 20%. The currently available pre-trained foundational ML models predict the right trend for thermal conductivity, but the associated errors are high, limiting their applications for coarse screening of materials.

Title: Resonantly enhanced photoemission from topological surface states in MnBi$_6$Te$_{10}$
Authors: Paulina Majchrzak, Alfred J. H. Jones, Klara Volckaert, Xing-Chen Pan, Philip Hofmann, Yong P. Chen, Jill A. Miwa, Søren Ulstrup
Abstract: The dispersion of topological surface bands in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-based magnetic topological insulator heterostructures is strongly affected by band hybridization and is spatially inhomogeneous due to varying surface layer terminations on microscopic length scales. Here, we apply micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with tunable photon energy from 18 to 30 eV to distinguish bulk valence and conduction bands from surface bands on the three surface terminations of MnBi$_6$Te$_10$. We observe a strong enhancement of photoemission intensity from the topological surface bands at the Bi O4 absorption edge, which is exploited to visualize a gapless Dirac cone on the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-terminated surface and varying degrees of hybridization effects in the surface bands on the two distinct Bi$_2$Te$_3$-terminated surfaces.

Title: Detection of ferroic octupole ordering in $d$-wave altermagnetic rutile-type compounds
Authors: Masaichiro Mizumaki, Norimasa Sasabe, Takayuki Uozumi, Rikuto Oiwa, Hiroaki Kusunose
Abstract: We propose that X-ray absorption and emission magnetic circular dichroism (XAS-MCD and XES-MCD) are promising measurements to directly detect ferroic higher-rank multipoles as candidate order parameters in altermagnets. Using the sum rules for XES-MCD and connecting them to multipole language, we demonstrate that the expectation value of the magnetic octupole moment is finite in the $d$-wave altermagnetic candidate rutile-type compounds TF$_2$ (T=transition metal). We also perform spectral calculations of XAS-MCD and XES-MCD based on an effective model with a full multiplet approach. While the intensity of the XAS-MCD spectra vanishes, the XES-MCD spectra exhibit finite intensity, whose spectrum becomes opposite by inverting the Nèel vector. These results clearly indicate ferroic magnetic octupole order in these compounds.

Title: Thickness Dependence and Fundamental Limitations for Ion Permeation in Nanoscale Films
Authors: Jay Prakash Singh, Konstantin I. Morozov, Viatcheslav Freger
Abstract: Nanoscale films play a central role in biology and osmotic separations. Their water/salt selectivity is often regarded as intrinsic property, favoring thinner membranes for faster permeation. Here we highlight and quantify a fundamental limitation arising from the dependence of ion self-energy on film thickness, governed by its ratio to Bjerrum length. The resulting relation factors out this dependence from intrinsic ion permeability, which agrees well with available data and enables evaluation of dielectric properties of ultrathin films, advancing understanding of ion transport in membranes.

Title: High-Throughput Quantification of Altermagnetic Band Splitting
Authors: Ali Sufyan, Brahim Marfoua, J. Andreas Larsson, Erik van Loon, Rickard Armiento
Abstract: Altermagnetism represents a recently established class of collinear magnetism that combines zero net magnetization with momentum-dependent spin polarization, enabled by symmetry constraints rather than spin-orbit coupling. This distinctive behavior gives rise to sizable spin splitting even in materials composed of light, earth-abundant elements, offering promising prospects for next-generation spintronics applications. Despite growing theoretical and experimental interest, the discovery of altermagnetic materials remains limited due to the complexity of magnetic symmetry and the inefficiency of conventional approaches. Here, we present a comprehensive high-throughput screening of the entire MAGNDATA database, integrating symmetry analysis with spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify and characterize altermagnetic candidates. Our workflow uncovers 173 materials exhibiting significant spin splitting ($\geq 50$ meV within $\pm 3$ eV of the Fermi level), spanning both metallic and semiconducting systems. Crucially, our momentum-resolved analysis reveals that the spin splitting varies strongly across the Brillouin zone, and that the maximal splitting tends to occur away from the high-symmetry paths, a result that directly informs and guides future photoemission experiments. By expanding the catalog of known altermagnets and elucidating the symmetry-protected origins of spin splitting, this work lays a robust foundation for future experimental and theoretical advances in spintronics and quantum materials discovery.

Title: Thermoelectric properties of defective scandium nitride nanostructures
Authors: Luigi Cigarini, Urszula Danuta Wdowik, Dominik Legut
Abstract: Transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) are currently being studied for potential applications in energy conversion. In this work, we used the Landauer approach to relate the various effects contributing to the thermoelectric efficiency of scandium nitride (ScN) to their microscopic origins. We model the impact of electronic and structural modifications induced by oxygen impurities and spatial vacancies on electronic transport in ScN nanostructures. Taking advantage of the results of our calculations, we propose a theoretical interpretation of recent experimental results revealing a strong dependence of the thermoelectric properties of ScN thin films on procedural variations during fabrication. The thermoelectric properties of ScN are decisively influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects or impurities. Our findings highlight the potential of this theoretical approach in studying thermoelectricity and uncovering future strategies to improve thermoelectric efficiency.

Title: Hydrodynamic Attraction and Hindered Diffusion Govern First-passage Times of Swimming Microorganisms
Authors: Yanis Baouche, Magali Le Goff, Thomas Franosch, Christina Kurzthaler
Abstract: The motion of microorganisms in their natural habitat is strongly influenced by their propulsion mechanisms, geometrical constraints, and random fluctuations. Here, we study numerically the first-passage-time (FPT) statistics of microswimmers, modeled as force-dipoles, to reach a no-slip wall. Our results demonstrate that hindered diffusion near the wall can increase the median FPT by orders of magnitude compared to "dry" agents, while the intricate interplay of active motion and hydrodynamic attraction speeds up the arrival at large Péclet numbers (measuring the importance of self-propulsion relative to diffusion). Strikingly, it leads to a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the dipole strength, where pushers reach the wall significantly faster than pullers. The latter become slower at an intermediate dipole strength and are more sensitive to their initial orientation, displaying a highly anisotropic behavior.

Title: Spin-photon coupling using circular double quantum dots
Authors: Ferdinand Omlor, Florinda Viñas Boström, Martin Leijnse
Abstract: We propose and analyze a microwave spin-photon interface based on a circular double quantum dot, inspired by recent experimental observations of anisotropic g-factors and ring states in InAs nanowires. We develop an effective theoretical model capturing the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic flux through the ring and show how ring states form at crossings of odd and even geometrical parity orbital states. Similar to bonding and antibonding states of conventional double quantum dots, the ring eigenstates can be changed into single dot states by detuning the dots, which enables a high degree of control over the system's properties. Applying a tilted magnetic field induces spin-charge hybridization which enables spin-photon coupling. For low disorder, the photons couple states of simultaneously (almost) opposite spin and angular momentum. With increasing disorder, the spin-photon coupling becomes analogous to the flopping mode mechanism of conventional double quantum dots where the spin is hybridized with the bonding and antibonding orbital states without angular momentum. We show that the system exhibits a second-order charge-noise sweet spot at a specific magnetic field angle, which lowers the system's sensitivity to dephasing while retaining a substantial spin-photon coupling strength. Moreover, the photon coupling mechanism can be switched off either electrically, by detuning to the single-dot regime, or magnetically, by rotating the field to disable the spin-charge hybridization.

Title: DNA mold-based fabrication of continuous silver nanostructures
Authors: Christoph Hadlich, Borja Rodriguez-Barea, Darius Pohl, Bernd Rellinghaus, Artur Erbe, Ralf Seidel
Abstract: Bottom-up fabrication of inorganic nanostructures is emerging as an alternative to classical top-down approaches, offering precise nanometer-scale control at relatively low cost and effort. In particular, DNA nanostructures provide versatile scaffolds for directly templating the growth of metal structures. Previously, a DNA mold-based method for metal nanostructure synthesis has been established that supports a modular structure design and a high control over the structure formation. So far, this method was limited to the growth of gold and palladium nanostructures. Here, we report the successful adaptation of the DNA mold-based fabrication method to produce continuous silver nanowires. By optimizing reagent concentrations and applying gentle thermal annealing, we obtain continuous wire structures of several hundred nanometer length, overcoming limitations in anisotropic growth. Despite the strong interaction of silver ions with DNA, we can control the growth without increasing the complexity of our approach. Our structures are not oxidized yet they did not exhibit conductivity. This work demonstrates the versatility of DNA-templated metallization and opens new opportunities for constructing self-assembled hybrid nanostructures with controlled shape and composition.

Title: Statistics makes a difference: Machine learning adsorption dynamics of functionalized cyclooctine on Si(001) at DFT accuracy
Authors: Hendrik Weiske, Rhyan Barrett, Ralf Tonner-Zech, Patrick Melix, Julia Westermayr
Abstract: The interpretation of experiments on reactive semiconductor surfaces requires statistically significant sampling of molecular dynamics, but conventional ab initio methods are limited due to prohibitive computational costs. Machine-learning interatomic potentials provide a promising solution, bridging the gap between the chemical accuracy of short ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and the extensive sampling required to simulate experiment. Using ethinyl-functionalized cyclooctyne adsorption on Si(001) as a model system, we demonstrate that conventional AIMD undersamples the configurational space, resulting in discrepancies with scanning tunnelling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data. To resolve these inconsistencies, we employ pre-trained equivariant message-passing neural networks, fine-tuned on only a few thousand AIMD snapshots, and integrate them into a "molecular-gun" workflow. This approach generates 10,000 independent trajectories more than 1,000 times faster than AIMD. These simulations recover rare intermediates, clarify the competition between adsorption motifs, and reproduce the experimentally dominant on-top [2+2] cycloaddition geometry. Our results show that fine-tuning of pre-trained foundational models enables statistically converged, chemically accurate simulations of bond-forming and bond-breaking events on complex surfaces, providing a scalable route to reconcile atomistic theory with experimental ensemble measurements in semiconductor functionalization.

Title: Modulational instability of inter-spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattice
Authors: R. Sasireka, S. Sabari, A. Uthayakumar, Lauro Tomio
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of modulational instability (MI) in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate with spin-orbit coupling, confined to a deep optical lattice. The system is modeled by a set of discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Using linear stability analysis, we derive the explicit MI conditions for the system, elucidating the critical and distinct roles played by spin-orbit coupling, inter-species nonlinearity, and intra-species nonlinearity. Our analysis, conducted for both unstaggered and staggered fundamental modes, reveals markedly different instability landscapes for these two configurations. The analytical predictions are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations of the full nonlinear dynamics, which vividly illustrate the spatiotemporal evolution of wave amplitudes, phase coherence, and energy localization during the instability process. The numerical results, obtained via a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, show excellent agreement with the linear stability theory and provide a complete picture of the MI-induced pattern formation.

Title: Minimal velocity of the travelling wave solutions in two coupled FKPP equations with the global conservation law
Authors: O.I. Baburin, I.S. Burmistrov
Abstract: We investigate the system of two coupled one-dimensional Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) equations which possess the global conservation law. Such system of equations has been recently derived for the quasiparticle densities in the two-band fermionic model with the particle-number conserving dissipative protocol. As standard FKPP equation the studied system of equations has one unstable and one stable homogeneous solution with travelling wave switching between them. We demonstrate that the conservation law enforces the synchronization of travelling waves for both densities and determine their minimal possible velocity. Surprisingly, we find the existence of jumps of the minimal velocity as function of control parameters. We obtain that the minimal velocity of the coupled FKPP equations may significantly exceed the minimal velocity for a single FKPP equation in a wide range of control parameters.

Title: Bloch oscillations of helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattices
Authors: Sumaita Sultana, Golam Ali Sekh
Abstract: We consider helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattice and study the dynamics of Bloch oscillation. We show that the variation of helicoidal gauge potential with spin-orbit coupling is different in zero-momentum and plane-wave phases. The characteristic of Bloch oscillation are different in the two phases. In the zero-momentum phase, the Bloch oscillation harmonic while it is anharminic in plane-wave phase. The amplitude of Bloch oscillation are found to be affected by the relative value of helicoidal gauge potential and spin-orbit coupling, and mean-field interaction. We examined that the decay of Bloch oscillation caused by mean-field interaction can be managed by helicoidal spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Julia Set in Quantum Evolution: The case of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions
Authors: Manmeet Kaur, Somendra M. Bhattacharjee
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are a class of non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body quantum systems during real-time evolution, rather than through parameter tuning as in conventional phase transitions. This paper presents an exact analytical approach to studying DQPTs by combining complex dynamics with the real-space renormalization group (RG). RG transformations are interpreted as iterated maps on the complex plane, establishing a connection between DQPTs and the Julia set, the fractal boundary separating the basins of attraction of the stable fixed points. This framework is applied to a quantum quench in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, and the sensitivity of DQPTs to changes in boundary conditions is examined. In particular, it is demonstrated how the topology of the spin chain influences the occurrence of DQPTs. Additionally, aqualitative argument based on quantum speed limits is provided to explain the suppression of DQPTs under certain boundary modifications.

Title: Investigating the Ferroelectric Potential Landscape of 3R-MoS$_2$ through Optical Measurements
Authors: Jan-Niklas Heidkamp, Johannes Schwandt-Krause, Swarup Deb, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Rico Schwartz, Tobias Korn
Abstract: In recent years, sliding ferroelectricity has emerged as a topic of significant interest due to its possible application in non-volatile random access memory. This phenomenon is unique to two-dimensional van der Waals materials, where vertical ferroelectric polarization switching is induced by relative in-plane sliding of the constituent layers. The intrinsic stacking order influences the resulting polarization, creating distinct polarization regions separated by domain walls. These regions and the domain walls can be manipulated using an applied vertical electric field, enabling a switchable system that retains the environmental robustness of van der Waals materials under ambient conditions. This study investigates 3R-MoS$_2$ using various optical measurement techniques at room temperature. The spatially resolved optical measurements reveal apparent signal changes corresponding to different ferroelectric stacking orders and variations in layer count. Our findings demonstrate that fast optical mapping at room temperature is a reliable method for probing ferroelectric potential steps in 3R-stacked MoS$_2$ samples, thereby facilitating the identification of the ferroelectric configuration. This approach does not require a conductive substrate or an electrical contact to the sample, making it more versatile than traditional atomic force probe techniques.

Title: Spin-polarised surface fermiology of ohmic WSe$_2$/NbSe$_2$ interfaces
Authors: Oliver J. Clark, Thi-Hai-Yen Vu, Ben A. Chambers, Federico Mazzola, Sadhana Sridhar, Geetha Balakrishnan, Aaron Bostwick, Chris Jozwiak, Eli Rotenberg, Sarah L. Harmer, Michael S. Fuhrer, Mark T. Edmonds
Abstract: Discovering and engineering spin-polarised surface states in the electronic structures of condensed matter systems is a crucial first step in development of spintronic devices, wherein spin-polarised bands crossing the Fermi level can facilitate information transfer. Here, we show how the spin-orbit split K-point valleys of monolayer WSe$_2$ can be made potentially suitable for this purpose, despite the semiconducting ground state. By interfacing with metallic 2H-NbSe$_2$, these valence band extrema are shifted by $\sim$800~meV to produce a surface-localised Fermi surface populated only by spin-polarised carriers. By increasing the WSe$_2$ thickness, the Fermi pockets can be moved from K to $\Gamma$, demonstrating tunability of novel semi-metallic phases that exist atop a substrate additionally possessing charge density wave and superconducting transitions. Together, this study provides spectroscopic understanding into $p$-type, Schottky barrier-free interfaces, which are of urgent interest for bypassing the limitations of current-generation vertical field effect transistors, in addition to longer-term spintronics development.

Title: Ultrafast controlling net magnetization in g-wave altermagnets via laser fields
Authors: Zhaobo Zhou, Sangeeta Sharma, Junjie He
Abstract: The diverse nodal spin structures in d/g/i-wave altermagnets (AM) may cause distinct light-induced spin responses yet remain poorly understood. Using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we reveal that laser induced ultrafast demagnetization dynamics in the g-wave AM CrSb are strongly governed by the laser incidence direction. Under normal incidence along the [0001] axis, two Cr sublattices exhibit symmetric temporal demagnetization but with different amplitudes, preserving the net-zero magnetization, unlike the behavior in d-wave AM. Off-normal incidence, however, induces pronounced asymmetric demagnetization between sublattices, transiently driving the system into a ferrimagnetic-like state with a sizable net magnetization. This direction-dependent response arises from the characteristic nodal structures in bulk g-wave AM electronic structure, which enable anisotropic optical intersite spin transfer (OISTR). By comparing g-wave and d-wave AMs, we propose that light-induced magnetization arises when laser polarization aligns with spin-uncompensated regions in electronic structures. This can be readily determined from the local spin density of states along specific band paths. Our results provide a fundamental understanding for laser-induced ultrafast dynamics in AM.

Title: Mapping Microstructure: Manifold Construction for Accelerated Materials Exploration
Authors: Simon A. Mason, Megna N. Shah, Jeffrey P. Simmons, Dennis M. Dimiduk, Stephen R. Niezgoda
Abstract: Accelerating materials development requires quantitative linkages between processing, microstructure, and properties. In this work, we introduce a framework for mapping microstructure onto a low-dimensional material manifold that is parametrized by processing conditions. A key innovation is treating microstructure as a stochastic process, defined as a distribution of microstructural instances rather than a single image, enabling the extraction of material state descriptors that capture the essential process-dependent features. We leverage the manifold hypothesis to assert that microstructural outcomes lie on a low-dimensional latent space controlled by only a few parameters. Using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition as a model material system, we compare multiple microstructure descriptors (two-point statistics, chord-length distributions, and persistent homology) in terms of two criteria: (1) intrinsic dimensionality of the latent space, and (2) invertibility of the processing-to-structure mapping. The results demonstrate that distribution-based descriptors can recover a two-dimensional latent structure aligned with the true processing parameters, yielding an invertible and physically interpretable mapping between processing and microstructure. In contrast, descriptors that do not account for microstructure variability either overestimate dimensionality or lose predictive fidelity. The constructed material manifold is shown to be locally continuous, wherein small changes in process variables correspond to smooth changes in microstructure descriptors. This data-driven manifold mapping approach provides a quantitative foundation for microstructure-informed process design and paves the way toward closed-loop optimization of processing--structure--property relationships in an integrated materials engineering context.

Title: A causality-based divide-and-conquer algorithm for nonequilibrium Green's function calculations with quantics tensor trains
Authors: Ken Inayoshi, Maksymilian Środa, Anna Kauch, Philipp Werner, Hiroshi Shinaoka
Abstract: We propose a causality-based divide-and-conquer algorithm for nonequilibrium Green's function calculations with quantics tensor trains. This algorithm enables stable and efficient extensions of the simulated time domain by exploiting the causality of Green's functions. We apply this approach within the framework of nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory to the simulation of quench dynamics in symmetry-broken phases, where long-time simulations are often required to capture slow relaxation dynamics. We demonstrate that our algorithm allows to extend the simulated time domain without a significant increase in the cost of storing the Green's function.

Title: Physics-Informed GCN-LSTM Framework for Long-Term Forecasting of 2D and 3D Microstructure Evolution
Authors: Hamidreza Razavi, Nele Moelans
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-informed framework that integrates graph convolutional networks (GCN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to forecast microstructure evolution over long time horizons in both 2D and 3D with remarkable performance across varied metrics. The proposed framework is composition-aware, trained jointly on datasets with different compositions, and operates in latent graph space, which enables the model to capture compositions and morphological dynamics while remaining computationally efficient. Compressing and encoding phase-field simulation data with convolutional autoencoders and operating in Latent graph space facilitates efficient modeling of microstructural evolution across composition, dimensions, and long-term horizons. The framework captures the spatial and temporal patterns of evolving microstructures while enabling long-range forecasting at reduced computational cost after training.

Title: Towards a deeper fundamental understanding of (Al,Sc)N ferroelectric nitrides
Authors: Peng Chen, Dawei Wang, Alejandro Mercado Tejerina, Keisuke Yazawa, Andriy Zakutayev, Charles Paillard, Laurent Bellaiche
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, within the virtual crystal alloy approximation, are performed, along with the development of a Landau-type model employing a symmetry-allowed analytical expression of the internal energy and having parameters being determined from first principles, to investigate properties and energetics of Al1-xScxN ferroelectric nitrides in their hexagonal forms. These DFT computations and this model predict the existence of two different types of minima, namely the 4-fold-coordinated wurtzite (WZ) polar structure and a 5-times paraelectric hexagonal phase (to be denoted as H5), for any Sc composition up to 40%. The H5 minimum progressively becomes the lowest energy state within hexagonal symmetry as the Sc concentration increases from 0 to 40%. Furthermore, the model points out to several key findings. Examples include the crucial role of the coupling between polarization and strains to create the WZ minimum, in addition to polar and elastic energies, and that the origin of the H5 state overcoming the WZ phase as the global minimum within hexagonal symmetry when increasing the Sc composition mostly lies in the compositional dependency of only two parameters, one linked to the polarization and another one being purely elastic in nature. Other examples are that forcing Al1-xScxN systems to have no or a weak change in lattice parameters when heating them allows to reproduce well their finite-temperature polar properties, and that a value of the axial ratio close to that of the ideal WZ structure does imply a large polarization at low temperatures but not necessarily at high temperatures because of the ordered-disordered character of the temperature-induced formation of the WZ state. Such findings should allow for a better fundamental understanding of (Al,Sc)N ferroelectric nitrides, which may be used to design efficient devices operating at low voltages.

Title: Layer-Dependent Spin Properties of Charge Carriers in Vertically Coupled Telecom Quantum Dots
Authors: Marius Cizauskas, A. Kors, J. P. Reithmaier, A. M. Fox, M. Benyoucef, Manfred Bayer, Alex Greilich
Abstract: We investigate the spin properties of charge carriers in vertically coupled InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dots grown by molecular beam epitaxy, emitting at telecom C-band wavelengths, with a silicon $\delta$-doped layer. Using time-resolved pump-probe Faraday ellipticity measurements, we systematically study single-, two-, and four-layer quantum dot (QD) configurations to quantify how vertical coupling affects key spin-coherence parameters. Our measurements reveal distinct layer-dependent effects: (1) Adding a second QD layer flips the resident charge from electrons to holes, consistent with optically induced electron tunneling into lower-energy dots and resultant hole charging. (2) Starting from the four-layer sample, the pump-probe signal develops an additional non-oscillating, decaying component absent in single- and two-layer samples, attributed to multiple layer growth changing the strain environment, which reduces heavy-hole and light-hole mixing. (3) With four-layers or more, hole spin mode locking (SML) can be observed, enabling quantitative extraction of the hole coherence time $T_2 \approx 13$\,ns from SML amplitude saturation. We also extract longitudinal spin relaxation ($T_1$) and transverse ($T_2^*$) spin dephasing times, g-factors, and inhomogeneous dephasing parameters for both electrons and holes across all layer configurations. The hole spin dephasing times $T_2^*$ remain relatively constant (2.26-2.73\,ns) across layer counts, while longitudinal relaxation times $T_1$ decrease with increasing layers (from 1.03\,$\mu$s for single-layer to 0.31\,$\mu$s for four-layer samples). These findings provide potential design guidelines for engineering spin coherence in telecom-band QDs for quantum information applications.

Title: Accurate measurement of energy relaxation via flux-flow instability
Authors: E. M. Baeva, N. A. Titova, M. A. Kirsanova, S.A. Evlashin, A. V. Semenov, D. Yu. Vodolazov, A. I. Kolbatova, G.N. Goltsman
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate flux-flow instability (FFI) in a superconducting single-crystal titanium nitride (TiN) film with negligible volume pinning. By studying the critical current density in 12-nm thick TiN strips of varying widths, we accurately identify the experimental parameters at which the FFI regime occurs. A comprehensive analysis of critical velocity measurements allows us to determine the quasiparticle energy relaxation time, $\tau_E$. By comparing our results with the $\tau_E$ values obtained from other experimental methods, we gain insight into the dominant microscopic process that governs quasiparticle relaxation within the vortex core in TiN. This mechanism is driven by an increase in quasiparticle temperature relative to phonons, rather than by quasiparticles leaving the core. Our findings indicate that $\tau_E$ can be accurately determined through FFI measurements.

Title: A pedestrian's approach to large deviations in semi-Markov processes with an application to entropy production
Authors: Alexander M. Maier, Jonas H. Fritz, Udo Seifert
Abstract: Semi-Markov processes play an important role in the effective description of partially accessible systems in stochastic thermodynamics. They occur, for instance, in coarse-graining procedures such as state lumping and when analyzing waiting times between few visible Markovian events. The finite-time measurement of any coarse-grained observable in a stochastic system depends on the specific realization of the underlying trajectory. Moreover, the fluctuations of such observables are encoded in their rate function that follows from the rate function of the empirical measure and the empirical flow in the respective process. Derivations of the rate function of empirical measure and empirical flow in semi-Markov processes with direction-time independence (DTI) exist in the mathematical literature, but have not received much attention in the stochastic thermodynamics community. We present an accessible derivation of the rate function of the tuple frequency in discrete-time Markov chains and extend this to the rate function of the empirical semi-Markov kernel in semi-Markov processes without DTI. From this, we derive an upper bound on the rate function of the empirical entropy production rate, which leads to a lower bound on the variance of the mean entropy production rate measured along a finite-time trajectory. We illustrate these analytical bounds with simulated data.

Title: Superconductivity in W3Re2C with chiral structure
Authors: Lei Yang, Jing Jiang, Hui-Hui He, Kai Liu, Hechang Lei
Abstract: We discover superconductivity in cubic W3Re2C with chiral structure and the superconducting transition temperature Tc is about 6.2 K. Detailed characterizations and analysis indicate that W3Re2C is a bulk type-II BCS superconductor with full isotropic gap. Moreover, first-principles calculations indicate that the electron-phonon coupling primarily arises from interactions between W/Re 5d electronic states and their low-frequency phonons. Furthermore, the breaking of inversion symmetry in W3Re2C facilitates the emergence of Weyl points in the electronic structure. Therefore, W3Re2C can serve as a promising platform for investigating the influences of chiral structure on both superconductivity and band topology.

Title: Sub-tesla on-chip nanomagnetic metamaterial platform for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
Authors: Wenxin Li, Wisha Wanichwecharungruang, Mingyang Guo, Ioan-Augustin Chioar, Nileena Nandakumaran, Justin Ramberger, Senlei Li, Zhibo Kang, Jinming Yang, Donghui Lu, Makoto Hashimoto, Chunhui Rita Du, Chris Leighton, Peter Schiffer, Qiong Ma, Ming Yi, Yu He
Abstract: Magnetically controlled states in quantum materials are central to their unique electronic and magnetic properties. However, direct momentum-resolved visualization of these states via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has been hindered by the disruptive effect of magnetic fields on photoelectron trajectories. Here, we introduce an \textit{in-situ} method that is, in principle, capable of applying magnetic fields up to 1 T. This method uses substrates composed of nanomagnetic metamaterial arrays with alternating polarity. Such substrates can generate strong, homogeneous, and spatially confined fields applicable to samples with thicknesses up to the micron scale, enabling ARPES measurements under magnetic fields with minimal photoelectron trajectory distortion. We demonstrate this minimal distortion with ARPES data taken on monolayer graphene. Our method paves the way for probing magnetic field-dependent electronic structures and studying field-tunable quantum phases with state-of-the-art energy-momentum resolutions.

Title: Diagrammatic bosonisation, aspects of criticality, and the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner Theorem in parquet approaches
Authors: Aiman Al-Eryani
Abstract: The parquet equations present a cornerstone of some of the most important diagrammatic many-body approximations and methods currently on the market for strongly correlated materials: from non-local extensions of the dynamical mean-field theory to the functional renormalization group. The recently introduced single-boson exchange decomposition of the vertex presents an alternative set of equivalent equations in terms of screened interactions, Hedin vertices, and rest functions. This formulation has garnered much attention for several reasons: opening the door to new approximations, for avoiding vertex divergences associated with local moment formation plaguing the traditional parquet decomposition, and for its interpretative advantage in its built-in diagrammatic identification of bosons without resorting to Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations. In this work, we show how the fermionic diagrams of the particle-particle and particle-hole polarizations can be mapped to diagrammatics of a bosonic self-energy of two respective bosonic theories with pure bosonic constituents, solidifying the identification of the screened interaction with a bosonic propagator. Resorting to a spin-diagonalized basis for the bosonic fields and neglecting the coupling between singlet and triplet components is shown to recover the trace log theory known from Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations. Armed with this concrete mapping, we revisit a conjecture claiming that universal aspects of the parquet approximation coincide with those of the self-consistent screening approximation for a bosonic $O(N)$ model. We comment on the role of the self-energy and crossing symmetry in enforcing the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem in parquet-related approaches.

Title: Zero Indirect Band Gap in Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Rahul S, Giandomenico Palumbo
Abstract: Zero indirect gaps in band models are typically viewed as unstable and achievable only through fine-tuning. Recent works, however, have revealed robust semimetallic phases in Hermitian systems where the indirect gap remains pinned at zero over a finite parameter range. Here, we extend this paradigm to non-Hermitian lattice models by studying a one-dimensional diamond-like system with gain and loss. We show that a zero indirect band gap can remain stable against non-Hermitian perturbations and identify the regimes where this robustness persists. Remarkably, we find that the zero indirect gap induces a suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect distinct from other physical mechanics already discussed in the literature. Our results reveal new connections between indirect gaps, exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effect, opening avenues for experimental realizations.

Title: Bichromatic Moiré Superlattices for Tunable Quadrupolar Trions and Correlated States
Authors: Mingfeng Chen, Runtong Li, Haonan Wang, Yuliang Yang, Yiyang Lai, Chaowei Hu, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Jiaqiang Yan, Jiun-Haw Chu, Erik Henriksen, Chuanwei Zhang, Li Yang, Xi Wang
Abstract: Moiré superlattices in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures provide a platform to engineer many-body interactions. Here, we realize a bichromatic moiré superlattice in an asymmetric WSe$_2$/WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterotrilayer by combining R- and H-stacked bilayers with mismatched moiré wavelengths. This structure hosts fermionic quadrupolar moiré trions--interlayer excitons bound to an opposite-layer hole--with vanishing dipole moments. These trions arise from hybridized moiré potentials enabling multiple excitonic orbitals with tunable interlayer coupling, allowing control of excitonic and electronic ground states. We show that an out-of-plane electric field could effectively reshape moiré excitons and interlayer-intralayer electron correlations, driving a transition from interlayer to intralayer Mott states with enhanced Coulomb repulsion. The asymmetric stacking further enriches excitonic selection rules, broadening opportunities for spin-photon engineering. Our results demonstrate bichromatic moiré superlattices as a reconfigurable platform for emergent quantum states, where quadrupolar moiré trion emission may enable coherent and entangled quantum light manipulation.

Title: Accelerated Discovery of Topological Conductors for Nanoscale Interconnects
Authors: Alexander C. Tyner, William Rogers, Po-Hsin Shih, Yi-Hsin Tu, Gengchiau Liang, Hsin Lin, Ching-Tzu Chen, James M. Rondinelli
Abstract: The sharp increase in resistivity of copper interconnects at ultra-scaled dimensions threatens the continued miniaturization of integrated circuits. Topological semimetals (TSMs) with gapless surface states (Fermi arcs) provide conduction channels resistant to localization. Here we develop an efficient computational framework to quantify 0K surface-state transmission in nanowires derived from Wannier tight-binding models of topological conductors that faithfully reproduce relativistic density functional theory results. Sparse matrix techniques enable scalable simulations incorporating disorder and surface roughness, allowing systematic materials screening across sizes, chemical potentials, and transport directions. A dataset of 3000 surface transmission values reveals TiS, ZrB$_{2}$, and nitrides AN where A=(Mo, Ta, W) as candidates with conductance matching or exceeding copper and benchmark TSMs NbAs and NbP. This dataset further supports machine learning models for rapid interconnect compound identification. Our results highlight the promise of topological conductors in overcoming copper's scaling limits and provide a roadmap for data-driven discovery of next-generation interconnects.

Abstract: The technology of silicon anodes appears to be reaching maturity, with high-energy Si cells already in pilot-scale production. However, the performance of these systems can be difficult to replicate in academic settings, making it challenging to translate research findings into solutions that can be implemented by the battery industry. Part of this difficulty arises from the lack of access to engineered Si particles and anodes, as electrode formulations and the materials themselves have become valuable intellectual property for emerging companies. Here, we summarize the efforts by Argonne's Cell Analysis, Modeling, and Prototyping (CAMP) Facility in developing Si-based prototypes made entirely from commercially available materials. We describe the many challenges we encountered when testing high-loading electrodes (> 5 mAh/cm2) and discuss strategies to mitigate them. With the right electrode and electrolyte design, we show that our pouch cells containing > 70 wt% SiOx can achieve 600-1,000 cycles at C/3 and meet projected energy targets of 700 Wh/L and 350 Wh/kg. These results provide a practical reference for research teams seeking to advance silicon-anode development using accessible materials.

Title: Competing and Intertwined Orders in Boson-Doped Mott Antiferromagnets
Authors: Xin Lu, Jia-Xin Zhang, Lukas Homeier, Hong-Chen Jiang, Shou-Shu Gong, D. N. Sheng, Zheng-Yu Weng
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental advances in cold atom quantum simulators, we explore the experimentally implemented bosonic $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on the square lattice using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. By tuning the doping level $\delta$ and hopping ratio $t'/t$, we uncover six distinct quantum phases, several of which go far beyond the conventional paradigm of phase-coherent superfluidity (SF) expected for bosonic systems. In particular, in the presence of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, doped holes are tightly bound into pairs, giving rise to a pair density wave (PDW) phase at low doping and small $|t'/t|$, which is suppressed on the $t'<0$ side, resulting in a disordered PDW state that lacks coherence of either individual bosons or pairs. Upon further doping, bosons can regain phase coherence and form a SF* state, characterized by condensation at emergent incommensurate momenta concurrent with an incommensurate magnetic order. On the $t'>0$ side, the sign-induced kinetic frustration inherently disfavors local AFM correlations, leading to a phase separation in which doped holes cluster into ferromagnetic (FM) domains spatially separated by undoped AFM regions. Upon further doping, this inhomogeneous state evolves into a uniform SF + $xy$-FM phase. Finally, we propose a concrete experimental scheme to realize both signs of $t'/t$ in Rydberg tweezer arrays, with an explicit mapping between model parameters and experimentally accessible regimes. Our results reveal competing and intertwined orders in doped antiferromagnets, which are relevant to central issues in high-$T_c$ superconductivity, reflecting the frustrated interplay between doped holes and spin background.

Title: Light-induced nonlinear Edelstein effect under ferroaxial ordering
Authors: Akimitsu Kirikoshi, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: Ferroaxial ordering, a spontaneous rotational distortion of the atomic arrangement, brings about a cross-product-type spin--orbit coupling (SOC) manifested as an electric toroidal dipole. We propose the light-induced nonlinear Edelstein effect (NLEE) -- a second-order optical response in which a static magnetization is induced by a time-dependent electric field -- as a promising probe of ferroaxial ordering. First, we elucidate the relationship between the NLEE tensor and the electric toroidal dipole. By decomposing the polarization modes of light, we find that both the linearly polarized and circularly polarized light couple to the electric toroidal dipole via distinct mechanisms. We then demonstrate the NLEE using a minimal model that incorporates ferroaxial ordering. Our analysis reveals that effective coupling between orbital magnetization and SOC induces spin magnetization. In particular, the spin magnetization is tilted owing to the electric toroidal dipole; the tilt angle reflects the ratio between the ferroaxial-origin SOC and the relativistic SOC.

Title: Accurate bootstrap bounds from optimal interpolation
Authors: Cyuan-Han Chang, Vasiliy Dommes, Petr Kravchuk, David Poland, David Simmons-Duffin
Abstract: We develop new methods for approximating conformal blocks as positive functions times polynomials, with applications to the numerical bootstrap. We argue that to obtain accurate bootstrap bounds, conformal block approximations should minimize a certain error norm related to the asymptotics of dispersive functionals. This error norm can be made small using interpolation nodes with an appropriate optimal density. The optimal density turns out to satisfy a kind of force-balance equation for charges in one dimension, which can be solved using standard techniques from large-N matrix models. We also describe how to use optimal density interpolation nodes to improve condition numbers inside the semidefinite program solver SDPB. Altogether, our new approximation scheme and improvements to condition numbers lead to more accurate bootstrap bounds with fewer computational resources. They were crucial in the recent bootstrap study of stress tensors in the 3d Ising CFT.

Title: Measuring dark state number in the Tavis-Cummings model
Authors: L. Theerthagiri, Rajesh Narayanan, R. Ganesh
Abstract: Quantum mechanics allows for light-matter setups that hold excitations without releasing them as light. Arising from destructive interference processes, they are best seen in a Tavis-Cummings-like setup where two-level atoms (or qubits) are placed within a lossy cavity. If the system is initialized with some qubits excited and some in the ground state, there is a non-zero probability that no photons will be emitted. This can be framed as a Stern-Gerlach measurement, with a detector to measure if one or more photons leave the cavity. If no photons are detected, the qubits collapse onto a dark state. This can be viewed as heralding of a dark state based on zero photon detection. Building upon this idea, we propose a protocol to measure the number of independent dark states. Moreover, we show that this quantity is robust to arbitrary levels of disorder in the qubit-photon coupling constants. We then discuss a phase transition where the number of dark states plays the role of an order parameter. This provides an exciting example of a phase transition that is completely insensitive to disorder.

Title: Anyonic membranes and Pontryagin statistics
Authors: Yitao Feng, Hanyu Xue, Yuyang Li, Meng Cheng, Ryohei Kobayashi, Po-Shen Hsin, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: Anyons, unique to two spatial dimensions, underlie extraordinary phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, but their generalization to higher dimensions has remained elusive. The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle exhibiting $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two dimensions, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5\!+\!1)$D 1-form $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show that the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition to the standard fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step process detects the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane excitations stabilize to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process.

Title: Probing the meV QCD Axion with the $\texttt{SQWARE}$ Quantum Semiconductor Haloscope
Authors: Jaanita Mehrani, Tao Xu, Andrey Baydin, Michael J. Manfra, Henry O. Everitt, Andrew J. Long, Kuver Sinha, Junichiro Kono, Shengxi Huang
Abstract: We propose the Semiconductor-Quantum-Well Axion Radiometer Experiment ($\texttt{SQWARE}$) -- a new experimental platform for direct detection of axion dark matter in the meV mass range -- based on resonantly enhanced axion-photon conversion through the inverse Primakoff effect in engineered quantum semiconductor heterostructures. The core of the radiometer is a GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well structure forming a magnetoplasmonic cavity, containing an ultrahigh-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, which realizes a tunable epsilon-near-zero resonance in the terahertz frequency range. By controlling the orientation of the cavity within a strong external magnetic field, both the resonance frequency and the axion-induced current are optimized $\textit{in situ}$, enabling efficient scanning across a broad mass range without complex mechanical adjustment. The axion-induced electromagnetic signal radiatively emitted from the magnetoplasmonic cavity is detected by a state-of-the-art photodetector. We present the theoretical basis for resonant enhancement, detail the experimental design and benchmarks through extensive simulations, and project the sensitivity of $\texttt{SQWARE}$ for several realistic configurations. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{SQWARE}$ can probe the well-motivated quantum chromodynamics axion parameter space and close a critical gap in direct searches at meV masses.

Title: Generation of Volume-Law Entanglement by Local-Measurement-Only Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Surajit Bera, Igor V. Gornyi, Sumilan Banerjee, Yuval Gefen
Abstract: Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However, recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of non-unitary many-body dynamics.

Title: Kilovolt-Class $β-Ga_2O_3$ Field-Plated Schottky Barrier Diodes with MOCVD-Grown Intentionally $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ Doped Drift Layers
Authors: Carl Peterson, Chinmoy Nath Saha, Rachel Kahler, Yizheng Liu, Akhila Mattapalli, Saurav Roy, Sriram Krishnamoorthy
Abstract: We report on the growth optimization of intentionally low-doped ($10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$) high-quality $\beta-Ga_2O_3$ drift layers up to 10 $\mu m$ thick via MOCVD and the fabrication of kilovolt-class field plated Schottky barrier diodes on these thick drift layers. Homoepitaxial growth was performed on (010) $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ substrates using TMGa as the Ga precursor. Growth parameters were systematically optimized to determine the best conditions for high quality thick growths with the given reactor geometry. Chamber pressure was found to improve the growth rate, mobility, and roughness of the samples. Growth rates of up to 7.2 $\mu m$/hr., thicknesses of up to 10 $\mu m$, Hall mobilities of up to 176 $cm^2$/Vs, RMS roughness down to 5.45 nm, UID concentrations as low as $2 \times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$, and controllable intentional doping down to $3 \times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ were achieved. Field plated Schottky barrier diodes (FP-SBDs) were fabricated on a $6.5 \times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ intentionally doped 10 $\mu m$ thick film to determine the electrical performance of the MOCVD-grown material. The FP-SBD was found to have current density $>$100 A/$cm^2$ at 3 V forward bias with a specific differential on resistance ($R_{on,sp}$) of 16.22 m$\Omega$.$cm^2$ and a turn on voltage of 1 V. The diodes were found to have high quality anode metal/semiconductor interfaces with an ideality factor of 1.04, close to unity. Diodes had a maximum breakdown voltage of 1.50 kV, leading to a punch-through maximum field of 2.04 MV/cm under the anode metal, which is a state-of-the-art result for SBDs on MOCVD-grown (010) drift layers.

Title: Coherent Control of Quantum-Dot Spins with Cyclic Optical Transitions

Abstract: Solid-state spins are promising as interfaces from stationary qubits to single photons for quantum communication technologies. Semiconductor quantum dots have excellent optical coherence, exhibit near unity collection efficiencies when coupled to photonic structures, and possess long-lived spins for quantum memory. However, the incompatibility of performing optical spin control and single-shot readout simultaneously has been a challenge faced by almost all solid-state emitters. To overcome this, we leverage light-hole mixing to realize a highly asymmetric lambda system in a negatively charged heavy hole exciton in Faraday configuration. By compensating GHz-scale differential Stark shifts, induced by unequal coupling to Raman control fields, and by performing nuclear-spin cooling, we achieve quantum control of an electron-spin qubit with a $\pi$-pulse contrast of 97.4% while preserving spin-selective optical transitions with a cyclicity of 409. We demonstrate this scheme for both GaAs and InGaAs quantum dots, and show that it is compatible with the operation of a nuclear quantum memory. Our approach thus enables repeated emission of indistinguishable photons together with qubit control, as required for single-shot readout, photonic cluster-state generation, and quantum repeater technologies.

Title: A generative model of function growth explains hidden self-similarities across biological and social systems
Authors: James Holehouse, S. Redner, Vicky Chuqiao Yang, P.L. Krapivsky, Jose Ignacio Arroyo, Geoffrey B West, Chris Kempes, Hyejin Youn
Abstract: From genomes and ecosystems to bureaucracies and cities, the growth of complex systems occurs by adding new types of functions and expanding existing ones. We present a simple generative model that generalizes the Yule-Simon process by including: (i) a size-dependent probability of introducing new functions, and (ii) a generalized preferential attachment mechanism for expanding existing ones. We uncover a shared underlying structure that helps explain how function diversity evolves in empirical observations, such as prokaryotic proteomes, U.S. federal agencies, and urban economies. We show that real systems are often best represented as having non-Zipfian rank-frequency distributions, driven by sublinear preferential attachment, whilst still maintaining power-law scaling in their abundance distributions. Furthermore, our analytics explain five distinct phases of the organization of functional elements across complex systems. The model integrates empirical findings regarding the logarithmic growth of diversity in cities and the self-similarity of their rank-frequency distributions. Self-similarity previously observed in the rank-frequency distributions of cities is not observed in cells and federal agencies -- however, under a rescaling relative to the total diversity, all systems admit self-similar structures predicted by our theory.

Title: Strong coupling of a microwave photon to an electron on helium
Authors: G. Koolstra, E.O. Glen, N.R. Beysengulov, H. Byeon, K.E. Castoria, M. Sammon, S.A. Lyon, D.G. Rees, J. Pollanen
Abstract: Electrons bound to the surface of superfluid helium have been proposed for scalable charge and spin-based quantum computing. However single electron quantum measurement in this system has remained elusive. Here we use a hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamic (cQED) device that comprises a quantum dot and a high-impedance superconducting resonator to demonstrate, for the first time, strong coupling between the resonator microwave field and the motional quantum state of the electron. We find a coupling strength between the electron motion and a resonator photon of $g/2\pi=118$ MHz, exceeding both the electron motional state decoherence and the resonator loss. These experiments open new avenues for investigating light-matter interaction at the single electron level, and are a key step towards measurement and control of electrons on helium-based spin qubits.

Title: Decoded Quantum Interferometry Requires Structure
Authors: Eric R. Anschuetz, David Gamarnik, Jonathan Z. Lu
Abstract: We study the performance of Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) on typical instances of MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT when the transpose of the constraint matrix is drawn from a standard ensemble of LDPC parity check matrices. We prove that if the decoding step of DQI corrects up to the folklore efficient decoding threshold for LDPC codes, then DQI is obstructed by a topological feature of the near-optimal space of solutions known as the overlap gap property (OGP). As the OGP is widely conjectured to exactly characterize the performance of state-of-the-art classical algorithms, this result suggests that DQI has no quantum advantage in optimizing unstructured MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT instances. We also give numerical evidence supporting this conjecture by showing that approximate message passing (AMP)--a classical algorithm conjectured to saturate the OGP threshold--outperforms DQI on a related ensemble of MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT instances. Finally, we prove that depth-$1$ QAOA outperforms DQI at sufficiently large $k$ under the same decoding threshold assumption. Our result follows by showing that DQI is approximately Lipschitz under the quantum Wasserstein metric over many standard ensembles of codes. We then prove that MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT exhibits both an OGP and a related topological obstruction known as the chaos property; this is the first known OGP threshold for MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT at fixed $k$, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we prove that both of these topological properties inhibit approximately Lipschitz algorithms such as DQI from optimizing MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT to large approximation ratio.

Title: The superconducting grid-states qubit

Abstract: Decoherence errors arising from noisy environments remain a central obstacle to progress in quantum computation and information processing. Quantum error correction (QEC) based on the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) protocol offers a powerful strategy to overcome this challenge, with successful demonstrations in trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and photonics. Beyond active QEC, a compelling alternative is to engineer Hamiltonians that intrinsically enforce stabilizers, offering passive protection akin to topological models. Inspired by the GKP encoding scheme, we implement a superconducting qubit whose eigenstates form protected grid states - long envisioned but not previously realized - by integrating an effective Cooper-quartet junction with a quantum phase-slip element embedded in a high-impedance circuit. Spectroscopic measurements reveal pairs of degenerate states separated by large energy gaps, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Remarkably, our observations indicate that the circuit tolerates small disorders and gains robustness against environmental noise as its parameters approach the ideal regime, establishing a new framework for exploring superconducting hardware. These findings also showcase the versatility of the superconducting circuit toolbox, setting the stage for future exploration of advanced solid-state devices with emergent properties.

Title: Enhancement of Weak Interactions in Phase Transitions
Authors: V. V. Flambaum
Abstract: Weak interactions cause small parity-violating energy differences between left- and right-handed chiral systems. Although normally tiny, these effects may be significantly enhanced during collective phenomena such as phase transitions. We propose a theoretical model describing the enhancement of weak interactions in phase transitions. The enhancement factor is proportional to the critical number of atoms, $N_c$, in the nucleus of the new phase. After the nucleus reaches its critical size, it grows until it fills the entire system. Measurement of the ratio of produced left and right chiral structures may provide a way to measure this critical number $N_c$. Experiments where definite spin-chiral structures are formed during a phase transition in crossed electric and magnetic fields, indicate $N_c \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$. An open question is whether a similar enhancement could operate during cosmological phase transitions - thereby boosting CP-violating effects sufficiently to contribute to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry (baryogenesis).

Title: Krylov complexity and Wightman power spectrum with positive chemical potentials in Schrödinger field theory
Authors: Peng-Zhang He, Lei-Hua Liu, Hai-Qing Zhang, Qing-Quan Jiang
Abstract: We systematically investigate the Krylov complexity of fermionic fields in Schrödinger field theory as the chemical potential is positive, validated by the engineered Wightman power spectra. For non-positive chemical potentials, the Lanczos coefficients exhibit linear behaviors with respect to $n$. However, as the chemical potential becomes positive, a dynamical transition occurs -- Lanczos coefficient $b_{n}$ develops a two-stage linear growth profile, transitioning from an initial slope of $\pi/\beta$ to the asymptotic slope of $2/\beta$; while Lanczos coefficient $a_{n}$ shows a deflection from near-zero values to linear descent with slope $-4/\beta$ where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature. Moreover, the engineered power spectra are used to study the evolution of the Krylov complexity and some universal behaviors are uncovered -- the single-sided exponential decay of the power spectrum results in the quadratic growth of the complexity, consistent with that from the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebraic construction. Conversely, the double-sided exponential decay of the power spectrum restores the exponential growth of the complexity, satisfying the maximal chaos bound. These results may provide new insights into the profound impact of chemical potential on the operator growth and Krylov complexity in the quantum field theory.

Title: Towards universal property prediction in Cartesian space: TACE is all you need
Authors: Zemin Xu, Wenbo Xie, Daiqian Xie, P. Hu
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized atomistic simulations and materials science, yet current approaches often depend on spherical-harmonic representations. Here we introduce the Tensor Atomic Cluster Expansion and Tensor Moment Potential, the first unified framework formulated entirely in Cartesian space for the systematic prediction of arbitrary structure-determined tensorial properties. TACE achieves this by decomposing atomic environments into a complete hierarchy of (irreducible) Cartesian tensors, ensuring symmetry-consistent representations that naturally encode invariance and equivariance constraints. Beyond geometry, TACE incorporates universal embeddings that flexibly integrate diverse attributes including basis sets, charges, magnetic moments and field perturbations. This allows explicit control over external invariants and equivariants in the prediction process. Long-range interactions are also accurately described through the Latent Ewald Summation module within the short-range approximation, providing a rigorous yet computationally efficient treatment of electrostatic interactions. We demonstrate that TACE attains accuracy, stability, and efficiency on par with or surpassing leading equivariant frameworks across finite molecules and extended materials, including in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, spectra, hessians, external-field response, charged systems, magnetic systems, multi-fidelity training, and heterogeneous catalytic systems. Crucially, TACE bridges scalar and tensorial modeling and establishes a Cartesian-space paradigm that unifies and extends beyond the design space of spherical-harmonic-based methods. This work lays the foundation for a new generation of universal atomistic machine learning models capable of systematically capturing the rich interplay of geometry, fields and material properties within a single coherent framework.

Title: Geometry Dependence of Charge Transport in Nanoscopic Au@PANI Nanoparticle Assemblies
Authors: Gyusang Yi, Borja Rodriguez-Barea, Gabriele Carelli, Lukas Mielke, Andreas Fery, Artur Erbe, Hendrik Schlicke
Abstract: Hybrid nanostructures from metal nanoparticles equipped with conducting polymer shells are of great interest for use as functional materials in sensing and optoelectronics, as well as for ink-deposited conductors. Here, we investigate the charge transport mechanism of nanostructures composed of gold nanoparticles coated with a polyaniline shell (Au@PANI). In particular, we focus on how geometry influences the charge transport behavior. Highly ordered linear assemblies of Au@PANI nanoparticles were fabricated using template-assisted assembly, while bulk-like films were obtained via drop-casting. Temperature-dependent transport measurements were analyzed using established theoretical models. Linear assemblies exhibit more localized transport, characterized by variable-range hopping (VRH) and thermally assisted tunneling (TAT), whereas bulk-like films show more delocalized transport, dominated by Arrhenius-type and thermionic conduction. These findings highlight the critical role of geometry in determining charge transport mechanisms in nanoparticle-based hybrid systems.

Abstract: Kinetic-inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) offer broadband near-quantum-limited amplification with high saturation power. Due to the high critical magnetic fields of high-kinetic-inductance materials, KI-TWPAs should be resilient to magnetic fields. In this work, we study how magnetic field and temperature affect the performance of a KI-TWPA based on a thin-NbTiN inverse microstrip with a Nb ground plane. This KI-TWPA can provide substantial signal-to-noise ratio improvement ($\Delta SNR$) up to in-plane magnetic fields of 0.35T and out-of-plane fields of 50mT, considerably higher than what has been demonstrated with TWPAs based on Josephson junctions. The field compatibility can be further improved by incorporating vortex traps and by using materials with higher critical fields. We also find that the gain does not degrade when the temperature is raised to 3K (limited by the Nb ground plane) while $\Delta SNR$ decreases with temperature consistently with expectation. This demonstrates that KI-TWPAs can be used in experiments that need to be performed at relatively high temperatures. The operability of KI-TWPAs in high magnetic field opens the door to a wide range of applications in spin qubits, spin ensembles, topological qubits, low-power NMR, and the search for axion dark matter.

Title: Twist fields in many-body physics
Authors: Benjamin Doyon
Abstract: The notion of twist fields has played a fundamental role in many-body physics. It is used to construct the so-called disorder parameter for the study of phase transitions in the classical Ising model of statistical mechanics, it is involved in the Jordan-Wigner transformation in quantum chains and bosonisation in quantum field theory, and it is related to measures of entanglement in many-body quantum systems. I provide a pedagogical introduction to the notion of twist field and the concepts at its roots, and review some of its applications, focussing on 1+1 dimension. This includes: locality and extensivity, internal symmetries, semi-locality, the standard exponential form and height fields, path integral defects and Riemann surfaces, topological invariance, and twist families. Additional topics touched upon include renormalisation and form factors in relativistic quantum field theory, tau functions of integrable PDEs, thermodynamic and hydrodynamic principles, and branch-point twist fields for entanglement entropy. One-dimensional quantum systems such as chains (e.g. quantum Heisenberg model) and field theory (e.g. quantum sine-Gordon model) are the main focus, but I also explain how the notion applies to equilibrium statistical mechanics (e.g. classical Ising lattice model), and how some aspects can be adapted to one-dimensional classical dynamical systems (e.g. classical Toda chain).

Title: Higher-order, generically complete, continuous, and polynomial-time isometry invariants of periodic sets
Authors: Daniel E Widdowson, Vitaliy A Kurlin
Abstract: Periodic point sets model all solid crystalline materials (crystals) whose atoms can be considered zero-sized points with or without atomic types. This paper addresses the fundamental problem of checking whether claimed crystals are novel, not noisy perturbations of known materials obtained by unrealistic atomic replacements. Such near-duplicates have already skewed ground truth because past comparisons relied on discontinuous cells and symmetries. The proposed Lipschitz continuity under noise is a new essential requirement for machine learning on any data objects that have ambiguous representations and live in continuous spaces. For periodic point sets under isometry (any distance-preserving transformation), we designed invariants that distinguish all known counter-examples to the completeness of past descriptors and confirm thousands of (near-)duplicates in the world's largest databases of inorganic crystals within hours on a desktop computer.

Title: Recovering elastic subdomains with strain-gradient elastic interfaces from force measurements: the antiplane shear setting
Authors: Govanni Granados, Jeremy L. Marzuola, Casey Rodriguez
Abstract: We introduce and study a new inverse problem for antiplane shear in elastic bodies with strain-gradient interfaces. The setting is a homogeneous isotropic elastic body containing an inclusion separated by a thin interface endowed with higher-order surface energy. Using displacement-stress measurements on the exterior boundary, expressed through a certain Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, we show uniqueness in recovering both the shear and interface parameters, as well as the shape of the inclusion. To address the inverse shape problem, we adapt the factorization method to account for the complications introduced by the higher-order boundary operator and its nontrivial null space. Numerical experiments illustrate the feasibility of the approach, indicating that the framework potentially provides a practical tool for nondestructive detection of interior inhomogeneities, including damaged subvolumes.

Title: Circuit-based chatacterization of finite-temperature quantum phases and self-correcting quantum memory
Authors: Ruochen Ma, Vedika Khemani, Shengqi Sang
Abstract: Quantum phases at zero temperature can be characterized as equivalence classes under local unitary transformations: two ground states within a gapped phase can be transformed into each other via a local unitary circuit. We generalize this circuit-based characterization of phases to systems at finite-temperature thermal equilibrium described by Gibbs states. We construct a channel circuit that approximately transforms one Gibbs state into another provided the two are connected by a path in parameter space along which a certain correlation-decay condition holds. For finite-dimensional systems of linear size $L$ and approximation error $\epsilon$, the locality of the circuit is ${\rm polylog}({\rm poly}(L)/\epsilon)$. The correlation-decay condition, which we specify, is expected to be satisfied in the interior of many noncritical thermal phases, including those displaying discrete symmetry breaking and topological order. As an application, we show that any system in the same thermal phase as a zero-temperature topological code coherently preserves quantum information for a macroscopically long time, establishing self-correction as a universal property of thermal phases. As part of the proof, we provide explicit encoding and decoding channel circuits to encode information into, and decode it from, a system in thermal equilibrium.

Title: Anomalous diffusion in convergence to effective ergodicity
Authors: M. Süzen
Abstract: Power-law exponents in the convergence to effective ergodicity is quantified for Ising-Lenz model in one dimension. Modified Thirumalai-Mountain (TM) metric for magnetisation is computed for the range of temperature values under strongly correlated dynamics. In producing evolution of TM metric over time, time-averaged dynamics is generated by using Metropolis and Glauber single-spin-flip dynamics, and ensemble-averaged dynamics with an exact solution. Superdiffusive behaviour is numerically identified in the parameter regimes studied, i.e., power-law exponents, $\alpha > 1.0$.

Title: Optimal switching strategies for navigation in stochastic settings
Authors: Francesco Mori, L. Mahadevan
Abstract: When navigating complex environments, animals often combine multiple strategies to mitigate the effects of external disturbances. These modalities often correspond to different sources of information, leading to speed-accuracy trade-offs. Inspired by the intermittent reorientation strategy seen in the behavior of the dung beetle, we consider the problem of the navigation strategy of a correlated random walker moving in two dimensions. We assume that the heading of the walker can be reoriented to the preferred direction by paying a fixed cost as it tries to maximize its total displacement in a fixed direction. Using optimal control theory, we derive analytically and confirm numerically the strategy that maximizes the walker's speed, and show that the average time between reorientations scales inversely with the magnitude of the environmental noise. We then extend our framework to describe execution errors and sensory acquisition noise. As a result, we provide a range of testable predictions and suggest new experimental directions. Our approach may be amenable to other navigation problems involving multiple sensory modalities that require switching between egocentric and geocentric strategies.

Title: Detection of Geometric Phases in Spin Waves using Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers
Authors: Tomas T. Osterholt, Pieter M. Gunnink, Rembert A. Duine
Abstract: Due to their robustness, the implementation of geometric phases provides a reliable and controllable way to manipulate the phase of a spin wave, thereby paving the way towards functional magnonics-based data processing devices. Moreover, geometric phases in spin waves are interesting from a fundamental perspective as they contain information about spin wave band structures and play an important role in magnon Hall effects. In this paper we propose to directly measure geometric phases in spin wave systems using the magnetic field sensing capabilities of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. We demonstrate the general principles of this method on two systems in which spin waves acquire a geometric phase, namely a wire with a magnetic domain wall and a system with position-dependent anisotropy axes, and explicitly show how this phase can be deduced from the NV center signal.

Title: Precise correspondence between the p-wave chiral superfluid and the spinless bosonic superfluid in the lowest Landau level
Authors: Wei-Han Hsiao
Abstract: We establish a precise formal correspondence between a spinless p-wave chiral fermionic superfluid and a spinless bosonic superfluid in a strong magnetic field by correctly accounting for superfluid vorticity in the effective theory of the former. In the literature, this vorticity term incompletely manifests as the magnetic field. This paper demonstrates this substitution can be understood as a truncation within the relevant expansion scheme, accompanied by field redefinitions. The components discarded in this truncation are critical for restoring the Berry phase term in the effective theory, encapsulating both systems in the same master Lagrangian. Beyond clarifying the structure of the Berry phase, this formalism allows for solving the bosonic system in the lowest Landau level (LLL) by analogy. Specifically, we show that, in the linear regime, the Maxwell equations governing these systems are identical when the vortex crystal is reformulated using an auxiliary electromagnetic field. This approach offers a unified perspective on these systems and yields solutions that are rotationally covariant, gauge invariants, and physically interpretable.

Title: Terahertz-induced tunnel ionization drives coherent Raman-active phonon in Bismuth
Authors: Bing Cheng, Patrick L. Kramer, Mariano Trigo, Mengkun Liu, David A. Reis, Zhi-Xun Shen, Jonathan A. Sobota, Matthias. C. Hoffmann
Abstract: Driving coherent lattice motion with THz pulses has emerged as a novel pathway for achieving dynamic stabilization of exotic phases that are inaccessible in equilibrium quantum materials. In this work, we present a previously unexplored mechanism for THz excitation of Raman-active phonons in semimetals. We show that intense THz pulses centered at 1 THz can excite the Raman-active $A_{1g}$ phonon mode at 2.9 THz in a bismuth film. We rule out the possibilities of the phonon being excited through conventional anharmonic coupling to other modes or via a THz sum frequency process. Instead, we demonstrate that the THz-driven tunnel ionization provides a plausible means of creating a displacive driving force to initiate the phonon oscillations. Our work highlights a new mechanism for exciting coherent phonons, offering potential for dynamic control over the electronic and structural properties of semimetals and narrow-band semiconductors on ultrafast timescales.

Title: Doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulator
Authors: Zhengyan Darius Shi, T. Senthil
Abstract: We study novel itinerant phases that can be accessed by doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator, with a focus on the experimentally observed Jain states at lattice filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$. Unlike in the lowest Landau level, where charge motion is confined into cyclotron orbits, the charged excitations in the FQAH occupy Bloch states with well-defined crystal momenta. At a non-zero doping density, this enables the formation of itinerant states of the doped anyons just beyond the FQAH plateau region. Specializing to the vicinity of $\nu = 2/3$, we describe a few possible such itinerant states. These include a topological superconductor with chiral neutral fermion edge modes as well as a more exotic Pair Density Wave (PDW) superconductor with non-trivial non-Abelian topological order. A Fermi liquid metal with a doping-induced period-3 charge density wave also occurs naturally in our analysis. This Fermi liquid (as well as the PDW) arises from pairing instabilities of a composite Fermi liquid metal that can emerge near filling $2/3$. Though inspired by the theory of anyon superconductivity, we explain how our construction is qualitatively different. At a general Jain filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$, the same analytical framework leads to a wider variety of phases including higher-charge superconductors and generalized composite Fermi liquids. We predict unusual physical signatures associated with each phase and analyze the crossover between different temperature regimes. These results provide a proof-of-principle that exotic itinerant phases can be stabilized by correlations intrinsic to the FQAH setup.

Title: Itinerant electron metamagnetism for lattices with van Hove density-of-states singularities near the Fermi level
Authors: F. A. Vasilevskiy, P. A. Igoshev, V. Yu. Irkhin
Abstract: Itinerant-electron metamagnetism is investigated within the Hubbard model for various lattices having van Hove singularities (vHS) in the electronic spectrum: face-centered cubic and orthorhombic lattices. The remarkable itinerant-electron metamagnetic transition occurs provided that the Fermi level is in the region with a strong positive curvature of the density of electron states typically positioned between two close van Hove singularities. Orthorhombic distortion of a~tetragonal lattice is a promising mechanism for generating two closely split vHS with strong density-of-states curvature between them. A phase diagram in terms of electron filling and Hubbard interaction parameter is presented, which shows the paramagnetic-metamagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition and regions of saturated and non-saturated magnetism. The standard Landau theory expansion based on~the~electron density of states in the vicinity of the Fermi level is demonstrated to be insufficient to describe the whole magnetic phase diagram including the itinerant-electron metamagnetic transition.

Title: Collapse of edge reconstruction in compressible Quantum Hall fluid within filling fraction range 2/3 to 1
Authors: Suvankar Purkait, Tanmay Maiti, Pooja Agarwal, Suparna Sahoo, Giorgio Biasiol, Lucia Sorba, Biswajit Karmakar
Abstract: The edge structure of a gate-defined compressible quantum Hall fluids in the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 is studied using the three reconstructed $e^2/3h$ fractional edge modes of unity filling integer quantum Hall state. We find that the individually excited partially resolved $e^2/3h$ edge modes of the bulk state equilibrate completely even at higher magnetic field when passing through the gate defined compressible fluid with filling between 2/3 and 1. This result is unexpected because edge reconstruction at the smooth boundary is generally expected due to dominant incompressibility at filling 2/3 and 1/3. Recently such reconstructed edge mode has been reported for the compressible fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3. In contrary, equilibration of fractional edge modes in the compressible fluid within the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 becomes faster with increasing magnetic field. This anomalous results will stimulate further investigations on edge structure in these complex many body systems.

Title: Biharmonic-Drive Tunable Josephson Diode
Authors: L. Borgongino, R. Seoane Souto, A. Paghi, G. Senesi, K. Skibinska, L. Sorba, E. Riccardi, F. Giazotto, E. Strambini
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect has garnered significant interest due to its prospective applications in cryogenic electronics and computing, enabling directional supercurrent transport. This phenomenon has been demonstrated across various superconducting platforms, which typically necessitate unconventional materials with broken spatial symmetries or external magnetic fields, posing scalability and integration challenges. This work introduces an innovative method to realize the superconducting diode effect by disrupting spatiotemporal symmetries in a conventional Josephson junction utilizing a biharmonic alternating-current (AC) drive signal. We achieve wireless modulation of the diode's polarity and efficiency with an antenna. Our findings indicate a diode efficiency reaching the ideal $100%$ over a broad frequency range, with a temperature resilience of up to 800 mK, and efficient AC signal rectification. This versatile and platform-independent superconducting diode signifies a promising component for advancing future superconducting digital electronics, including efficient logic gates, ultrafast switches, and dynamic half-wave supercurrent rectifiers.

Title: Sign competing sources of Berry curvature and anomalous Hall conductance humps in topological ferromagnets
Authors: Wojciech Brzezicki, Carmine Autieri, Mario Cuoco
Abstract: The use of Berry-phase concepts has established a strong link between the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and the topological character of the Hall currents. However, the occurrence of sign competition in the Berry curvature often hinders the topological origin of the observed anomalous Hall effects. Here, we study a two-dimensional topological ferromagnet with coupled spin and orbital degrees of freedom to assess the anomalous Hall effects in the presence of sign-competing sources of Berry curvature. We show that 2D itinerant topological ferromagnets described by t2g electronic states can generally lead to topological metallic bands marked by a non-zero Chern number. We find that the resulting Berry curvature at the Fermi level exhibits a characteristic anisotropic profile with a non-monotonous angular dependence when the magnetization is reversed. The sign change of the intrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall conductance can occur together with topological transitions or be driven by the population imbalance of the topological bands. The breaking of the inversion symmetry introduces the orbital Rashba coupling in the system. The interplay between the orbital Rashba and sign competing sources of Berry curvature leads to anomalies in the anomalous Hall conductance at values of magnetic fields for which the magnetization switches its orientation. The humps in topological ferromagnets arise when the anomalous Hall conductivity is small in absolute value and they can be detected only close to the sign-change of the AHE and far from half-filling. This study could be relevant for the family of the topological 2D ferromagnets as well as Weyl ferromagnets, and can particularly account for the variety of unconventional behaviors observed in ultrathin films of SrRuO$_3$.

Title: Chiral split magnons in metallic g-wave altermagnets: Insights from many-body perturbation theory
Authors: Wejdan Beida, Ersoy Sasioglu, Christoph Friedrich, Gustav Bihlmayer, Yuriy Mokrousov, Stefan Blügel
Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel class of magnetic materials that bridge the gap between ferromagnets (FMs) and antiferromagnets (AFMs). A key feature is the non-degeneracy of magnon modes where spin splitting occurs, leading to chirality and direction-dependent magnon dispersions governed by symmetry. We explore this in metallic g-wave altermagnets (\(TPn\), where \(T\)= V, Cr; \(Pn\)= As, Sb, Bi) using density functional and many-body perturbation theories. We analyze the influence of pnictogen substitution on spin splitting and magnon behavior. We uncover anisotropic magnon band splitting aligned with electronic structure, and wavevector- and chirality-dependent damping due to Stoner excitations. We identify regions in the Brillouin zone where the chiral magnon splitting overcomes the damping. These findings suggest altermagnets are promising for spintronic and magnonic technologies, where direction-dependent magnon lifetimes and nonreciprocal magno transport may enable chiral magnon propagation, while wavevector-selective damping could be harnessed for fast and controllable magnetization switching.

Title: Combined tight-binding and configuration interaction study of unfolded electronic structure of G-color center in Si
Authors: Jakub Valdhans, Petr Klenovský
Abstract: We have theoretically studied the G-center in bulk silicon material using the empirical tight-binding model for calculations of unfolded band structures with configuration interaction correction for the exciton at $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone. The G-center in B configuration (emissive) being a candidate structure as the telecom single- and entangled-photon source has two substitutional carbons and one interstitial atom embedded into the bulk in six equally possible configurations. Taking the advantage of the low computation effort of the tight-binding and unfolding approach, it is possible to calculate and analyze the behavior of a variety of the electronic configurations. Our tight-binding model is able to describe not only the behavior of the G-center in the silicon bulk but using the unfolding approach it can also pinpoint the contributions of different elements of the supercell on the final pseudo-band structure. Moreover, the configuration interaction correction with single-particle basis states computed by our unfolded tight-binding model predicts a very small fine-structure splitting of the ground state exciton both for bright and dark doublet in the studied system. That underscores the possibility of the silicon G-center to become a very good emitter of single and entangled photons for quantum communication and computation applications.

Title: Thermoelectric performance of Ni-Au metallic alloys determined by resonant scattering
Authors: Kacper Pryga, Bartlomiej Wiendlocha
Abstract: This work presents a theoretical study of the electronic structure and transport properties of Ni-Au alloys, recently identified as excellent thermoelectric metals with a power factor significantly exceeding that of conventional semiconductor thermoelectrics. Using first-principles calculations based on the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method combined with the coherent-potential approximation (KKR-CPA) and the Kubo-Greenwood formalism, we demonstrate the key role of resonant scattering in determining the thermoelectric properties of these alloys. This is supported by calculated densities of states, Bloch spectral functions, electrical conductivity, and thermopower. Alloying Ni with Au not only induces resonant scattering but also leads to the formation of a flat band below the Fermi level. The combination of these two features results in high thermopower, arising from a transition between resonant and weak scattering regimes near the Fermi level. Our findings are further compared with analogous calculations for constantan, a Ni-Cu alloy long regarded as a reference thermoelectric metal. We show that differences between the Ni-Au and Ni-Cu systems explain why Ni-Au exhibits nearly twice the thermopower of Ni-Cu. Finally, we simulate the effect of lattice parameter variation on the thermoelectric performance of Ni-Au and suggest that this is a promising pathway for further enhancement, for example through additional alloying or layer deposition.

Title: Mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of the random transverse-field Ising chain
Authors: Róbert Juhász
Abstract: Based on the strong-disorder renormalization group method, a microscopic mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of the random transverse-field Ising chain is proposed, which represents the annealing process as a gradual aggregation of strongly coupled spin clusters. The ferromagnetic ground state of clusters is either preserved or get excited in pairwise fusions of clusters, depending on the effective annealing rate of the fusion, the latter events being responsible for the appearance of defects in the final state. A consequence of the theory is that, although the Griffiths-McCoy phases surrounding the critical point are gapless, they are still effectively gapped from the point of view of quantum annealing. Thereby we provide an explanation of the finiteness of gap outside of the critical point, which was implicit in an early approach to the problem by Kibble-Zurek scaling [Dziarmaga, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 74}, 064416 (2006)]. Furthermore, by identifying the accessible excitations, we refine the functional form of the vanishing of the gap at the critical point. The defect density in the final state is found to decrease with the annealing time $\tau$, as $n(\tau)\sim \ln^{-2}\left(\frac{\tau}{\ln^2\tau}\right)$ for large $\tau$. In addition to this, our approach gives access also to the density of defects at intermediate times of the annealing process.

Title: Visualizing a Terahertz Superfluid Plasmon in a Two-Dimensional Superconductor

Abstract: The superconducting gap defines the fundamental energy scale for the emergence of dissipationless transport and collective phenomena in a superconductor. In layered high-temperature cuprate superconductors, where the Cooper pairs are confined to weakly coupled two-dimensional copper-oxygen planes, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy at sub-gap millielectronvolt energies has provided crucial insights into the collective superfluid response perpendicular to the superconducting layers. However, within the copper-oxygen planes the collective superfluid response manifests as plasmonic charge oscillations at energies far exceeding the superconducting gap, obscured by strong dissipation. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of a below-gap, two-dimensional superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and spatially resolve its deeply sub-diffractive THz electrodynamics. By placing the superconductor in the near-field of a spintronic THz emitter, we reveal this distinct resonance-absent in bulk samples and observed only in the superconducting phase-and determine its plasmonic nature by mapping the geometric anisotropy and dispersion. Crucially, these measurements offer a direct view of the momentum- and frequency dependent superconducting transition in two dimensions. These results establish a new platform for investigating superfluid phenomena at finite momenta and THz frequencies, highlighting the potential to engineer and visualize superconducting devices operating at ultrafast THz rates.

Title: From Attraction to Repulsion: Emergent Interactions in Harmonically Coupled Active Binary System
Authors: Ritwick Sarkar, Sreya Chatterjee, Urna Basu
Abstract: We investigate the emergent interactions between two active Brownian particles coupled by an attractive harmonic potential and in contact with a thermal reservoir. By analyzing the stationary distribution of their separation, we demonstrate that the effective interaction can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the interplay between activity, coupling strength, and temperature. Notably, we find that an effective short-range repulsion emerges in the strong and moderate-coupling regimes, when the temperature is below some threshold value, which we characterize analytically. In the strong-coupling regime, the repulsion emerges solely due to the difference in the self-propulsion speeds of the particles. We also compute the short-time position distribution of the centroid of the coupled particles, which shows strongly non-Gaussian fluctuations at low temperatures.

Title: Superconducting bistability in floating Al islands of hybrid Al/InAs nanowires
Authors: E.V. Shpagina, E.S. Tikhonov, D. Ruhstorfer, G. Koblmueller, V.S. Khrapai
Abstract: We investigate a non-equilibrium aspect of the current-driven superconducting-normal phase transition in floating Al islands of epitaxial full-shell Al/InAs nanowires. Within a transition region discontinuous voltage jumps and hysteretic behaviour of the I-V characteristics are observed, associated with the destruction and recovery of the superconducting order parameter in the island. The strength of the two features varies strongly in different devices in a mutually correlated way and can be suppressed by a small magnetic field. Numerical calculation explains this behaviour in terms of a tiny non-equilibrium correction to the electronic energy distribution at low energies. The experiment demonstrates a critical failure of a two-temperature non-equilibrium model of the superconductor-normal transition in floating islands of hybrid nanowire devices.

Title: Theory of nonlinear magnetoelectric transport effects in normal-metal $-$ magnetic-insulator heterostructures
Authors: Oliver Franke, Piet W. Brouwer
Abstract: Heterostructures of normal metals (N) and magnetic insulators (F) show paradigmatic effects, such as spin-Hall magnetoresistance and electric drag currents. These effects are linear in the applied electric field $E(\omega)$. Normal-metal $-$ magnetic-insulator heterostructures also exhibit a characteristic nonlinear response quadratic in $E(\omega)$, referred to as unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance or spin-torque diode effect. In this article, we develop a theory of the bilinear response of FN bilayers and NFN trilayers for finite frequencies $\omega$ of the driving field and for four contributions that have been previously considered in the literature: Joule heating, phonon-mediated unidirectional magnetoresistance, the spin-torque diode effect, and magnonic unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance. We identify their distinct dependencies on frequency and the magnetization direction of the magnetic insulator and examine their scaling with magnetic field and system geometry, providing a framework for experimental differentiation.

Title: Generalized invariants meet constitutive neural networks: A novel framework for hyperelastic materials
Authors: Denisa Martonová, Alain Goriely, Ellen Kuhl
Abstract: The major challenge in determining a hyperelastic model for a given material is the choice of invariants and the selection how the strain energy function depends functionally on these invariants. Here we introduce a new data-driven framework that simultaneously discovers appropriate invariants and constitutive models for isotropic incompressible hyperelastic materials. Our approach identifies both the most suitable invariants in a class of generalized invariants and the corresponding strain energy function directly from experimental observations. Unlike previous methods that rely on fixed invariant choices or sequential fitting procedures, our method integrates the discovery process into a single neural network architecture. By looking at a continuous family of possible invariants, the model can flexibly adapt to different material behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using popular benchmark datasets for rubber and brain tissue. For rubber, the method recovers a stretch-dominated formulation consistent with classical models. For brain tissue, it identifies a formulation sensitive to small stretches, capturing the nonlinear shear response characteristic of soft biological matter. Compared to traditional and neural-network-based models, our framework provides improved predictive accuracy and interpretability across a wide range of deformation states. This unified strategy offers a robust tool for automated and physically meaningful model discovery in hyperelasticity.

Title: 3D Strain Field Reconstruction by Inversion of Dynamical Scattering
Authors: Laura Niermann, Tore Niermann, Chengyu Song, Colin Ophus
Abstract: Strain governs not only the mechanical response of materials but also their electronic, optical, and catalytic properties. For this reason, the measurement of the 3D strain field is crucial for a detailed understanding and for further developments of material properties through strain engineering. However, measuring strain variations along the electron beam direction has remained a major challenge for (scanning-) transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM). In this article, we present a method for 3D strain field determination using 4D-STEM. The method is based on the inversion of dynamical diffraction effects, which occur at strain field variations along the beam direction. We test the method against simulated data with a known ground truth and demonstrate its application to an experimental 4D-STEM dataset from an inclined pseudomorphically grown Al$_{0.47}$Ga$_{0.53}$N layer.

Title: Quantum Hall Antidot as a Fractional Coulombmeter
Authors: Mario Di Luca, Emily Hajigeorgiou, Zekang Zhou, Tevž Lotrič, Tengyan Feng, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Steven H. Simon, Mitali Banerjee
Abstract: The detection of fractionally charged quasiparticles, which arise in the fractional quantum Hall regime, is of fundamental importance for probing their exotic quantum properties. While electronic interferometers have been central to probe their statistical properties, their interpretation is often complicated by bulk-edge interactions. Antidots, potential hills in the quantum Hall regime, are particularly valuable in this context, as they overcome the geometric limitations of conventional designs and act as controlled impurities within a quantum point contact. Furthermore, antidots allow for quasiparticle charge detection through straightforward conductance measurements, replacing the need for more demanding techniques. In this work, we employ a gate-defined bilayer graphene antidot operating in the Coulomb-dominated regime to study quasiparticle tunneling in both integer and fractional quantum Hall states. We show that the gate-voltage period and the oscillation slope directly reveal the charge of the tunneling quasiparticles, providing a practical method to measure fractional charge in graphene. We report direct measurements of fractional charge, finding $q = e/3$ at $\nu = 4/3$, 5/3 and 7/3, $q = 2e/3$ at $\nu = 2/3$ and $q = 3e/5$ at $\nu = 3/5$, while at $\nu = 8/3$ we observe signatures of both $e/3$ and $2e/3$ tunneling charge. The simplicity and tunability of this design open a pathway to extend antidot-based charge measurements to other van der Waals materials, establishing antidots as a powerful and broadly applicable platform to study the quantum Hall effect.

Title: Oxygen-driven altermagnetic symmetry inducing d-wave superconductivity in the cuprates and nickelates
Authors: Tom G. Saunderson, James F. Annett, Samir Lounis
Abstract: Since the discovery of cuprate high-Tc superconductivity, numerous theoretical frameworks have been proposed to explain its mechanism; Anderson's RVB picture [Science 235, 1196-1198, 1987] and U(1) gauge theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 503-506, 1996] motivate a minimal one-band view that largely integrates out oxygen. By contrast, altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. X 12, 040501, 2022] yields a d-wave-like k-space magnetic texture from alternatingly rotated nonmagnetic cages; La2CuO4 (the parent of a high-Tc cuprate) is a prototypical example. As a proof of principle, we show in La2CuO4 that an alternating local pairing potential on the two Cu sublattices (plus/minus s(r)) produces a nodal, d-wave-like Delta(k). As orthorhombic tilts are, however, not the driver (and even suppress superconductivity in nickelates; [Nature 621, 493, (2023)], we then show that the in-plane oxygen sublattice of CuO2/NiO2 layers, ubiquitous in cuprates and nickelates, intrinsically realizes the same symmetry. Imposing an oxygen-centered, staggered s pairing yields a d-wave gap with perfect C4 symmetry, demonstrated self-consistently in NdNiO2 from first principles. While the underlying mechanism that drives this order is unclear, we outline possible origins. Further, this description of superconductivity enables mapping a real-space superconducting order parameter onto a lattice picture, allowing superconductivity and Hubbard physics to be treated on the same footing.

Title: Detective quantum efficiency based comparison of HRTEM and ptychography phase imaging
Authors: Felix Bennemann, Angus I. Kirkland, David A. Muller, Peter Nellist
Abstract: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is an important method for imaging beam sensitive materials often under cryo conditions. Electron ptychography in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) has been shown to reconstruct low-noise phase data at a reduced fluence for such materials. This raises the question of whether ptychography or HRTEM provides a more fluence-efficient imaging technique. Even though the transfer function is a common metric for evaluating the performance of an imaging method, it only describes the signal transfer with respect to spatial frequency, irrespective of the noise transfer. It can also not be well defined for methods, such as ptychography, that use an algorithm to form the final image. Here we apply the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE) to electron microscopy as a fluence independent and sample independent measure of technique performance. We find that, for a weak-phase object, ptychography can never reach the efficiency of a perfect Zernike phase imaging microscope but that ptychography is more robust to partial coherence.

Title: Origin of Reverse Size Effect in Ferroelectric Hafnia Thin Films
Authors: Tianyuan Zhu, Shi Liu
Abstract: The persistence of ferroelectricity in ultrathin HfO$_2$ films challenges conventional theories, particularly given the paradoxical observation that the out-of-plane lattice spacing increases with decreasing thickness. We resolve this puzzle by revealing that this anomalous lattice expansion is counterintuitively coupled to suppressed out-of-plane polarization. First-principles calculations combined with analytical modeling identify two mechanisms behind this expansion: a negative longitudinal piezoelectric response to the residual depolarization field and a positive surface stress that becomes significant at reduced thickness. Their interplay quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed lattice expansion. Furthermore, (111)-oriented HfO$_2$ films can support out-of-plane polarization even under open-circuit conditions, in contrast to (001) films that stabilize a nonpolar ground state. This behavior points to the emergence of orientation-induced hyperferroelectricity, an unrecognized mechanism that enables polarization persistence through orientation engineering without electrode screening. The principle also extends to perovskite ferroelectrics such as PbTiO$_3$, offering a strategy to eliminate critical thickness limits by selecting appropriate film orientations. As a practical pathway to device integration, we also identify the two-dimensional electride Ca$_2$N as a near-ideal electrode that fully restores the ferroelectric properties of HfO$_2$ in ultrathin capacitors.

Title: Non-Abelian Gauge Theory of Spin Triplet Superconductivity and Spin Triplet Magnon Spintronics
Authors: Franklin H. Cho, Y.M. Cho, Pengming Zhang, Li-Ping Zou
Abstract: We present an SU(2)xU(1) genralization of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for the spin triplet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also describe the physics of the spin triplet magnon spintronics, where the SU(2) gauge interaction of the magnon plays an important role. The theory is made of the massive photon, massless neutral magnon, massive non-Abelian magnon, and the Higgs scalar field which represents the density of the Copper pair. It has the following characteristic features, the long range magnetic interaction mediated by the massless magnon, two types of conserved supercurrents (the ordinary charge current and the spin current of the magnons), and the non-Abelian Meissner effect generated by the spin current. Moreover, it has non-Abelian topological objects, the quantized non-Abelian magnonic vortex and non-Abelian magnonic monopole, as well as the ordinary Abrikosov vortex. The theory is characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by the mass of the Higgs field it has two different mass scales, the one fixed by the mass of the photon and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal magnon. We compare the theory with the non-Abelian gauge theory of the spin doublet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also be interpreted as an effective theory of the electron spintronics. We discuss the physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge theories in condensed matter physics.

Title: Non-universal Thermal Hall Responses in Fractional Quantum Hall Droplets
Authors: Fei Tan, Yuzhu Wang, Xinghao Wang, Bo Yang
Abstract: We analytically compute the thermal Hall conductance (THC) of fractional quantum Hall droplets under realistic conditions that go beyond the idealized linear edge theory with conformal symmetry. Specifically, we consider finite-size effects at low temperature, nonzero self-energies of quasiholes, and general edge dispersions. We derive measurable corrections in THC that align well with the experimental observables. Although the quantized THC is commonly regarded as a topological invariant that is independent of edge confinement, our results show that this quantization remains robust only for arbitrary edge dispersion in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the THC contributed by Abelian modes can become extremely sensitive to finite-size effects and irregular confining potentials in any realistic experimental system. In contrast, non-Abelian modes show robust THC signatures under perturbations, indicating an intrinsic stability of non-Abelian anyons.

Title: Phase structure of self-dual lattice gauge theories in 4d
Authors: Mariia Anosova, Christof Gattringer, Nabil Iqbal, Tin Sulejmanpasic
Abstract: We discuss U(1) lattice gauge theory models based on a modified Villain formulation of the gauge action, which allows coupling to bosonic electric and magnetic matter. The formulation enjoys a duality which maps electric and magnetic sectors into each other. We propose several generalizations of the model and discuss their 't~Hooft anomalies. A particularly interesting class of theories is the one where electric and magnetic matter fields are coupled with identical actions, such that for a particular value of the gauge coupling the theory has a self-dual symmetry. The self-dual symmetry turns out to be a generator of a group which is a central extension of $\mathbb Z_4$ by the lattice translation symmetry group. The simplest case amenable to numerical simulations is the case when there is exactly one electrically and one magnetically charged boson. We discuss the phase structure of this theory and the nature of the self-dual symmetry in detail. Using a suitable worldline representation of the system we present the results of numerical simulations that support the conjectured phase diagram.

Title: Tomography of entangling two-qubit logic operations in exchange-coupled donor electron spin qubits

Jamieson, Andrea Morello
Abstract: Scalable quantum processors require high-fidelity universal quantum logic operations in a manufacturable physical platform. Donors in silicon provide atomic size, excellent quantum coherence and compatibility with standard semiconductor processing, but no entanglement between donor-bound electron spins has been demonstrated to date. Here we present the experimental demonstration and tomography of universal 1- and 2-qubit gates in a system of two weakly exchange-coupled electrons, bound to single phosphorus donors introduced in silicon by ion implantation. We surprisingly observe that the exchange interaction has no effect on the qubit coherence. We quantify the fidelity of the quantum operations using gate set tomography (GST), and we use the universal gate set to create entangled Bell states of the electrons spins, with fidelity ~ 93%, and concurrence 0.91 +/- 0.08. These results form the necessary basis for scaling up donor-based quantum computers.

Title: Quantum Convolutional Neural Network for Phase Recognition in Two Dimensions
Authors: Leon C. Sander, Nathan A. McMahon, Petr Zapletal, Michael J. Hartmann
Abstract: Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) are quantum circuits for characterizing complex quantum states. They have been proposed for recognizing quantum phases of matter at low sampling cost and have been designed for condensed matter systems in one dimension. Here we construct a QCNN that can perform phase recognition in two dimensions and correctly identify the phase transition from a Toric Code phase with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-topological order to the paramagnetic phase. The network also exhibits a noise threshold up to which the topological order is recognized. Furthermore, it captures correlations between all stabilizer elements of the Toric Code, which cannot be accessed by direct measurements. This increases the threshold for errors leading to such correlations and allows for correctly identifying the topological phase in the presence of strong correlated errors. Our work generalizes phase recognition with QCNNs to higher spatial dimensions and intrinsic topological order, where exploration and characterization via classical numerics become challenging.

Title: Synaptic Theory of Chunking in Working Memory
Authors: Weishun Zhong, Mikhail Katkov, Misha Tsodyks
Abstract: Working memory often appears to exceed its basic span by organizing items into compact representations called chunks. Chunking can be learned over time for familiar inputs; however, it can also arise spontaneously for novel stimuli. Such on-the-fly structuring is crucial for cognition, yet the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Here we introduce a synaptic theory of chunking, in which short-term synaptic plasticity enables the formation of chunk representations in working memory. We show that a specialized population of ``chunking neurons'' selectively controls groups of stimulus-responsive neurons, akin to gating. As a result, the network maintains and retrieves the stimuli in chunks, thereby exceeding the basic capacity. Moreover, we show that our model can dynamically construct hierarchical representations within working memory through hierarchical chunking. A consequence of this proposed mechanism is a new limit on the number of items that can be stored and subsequently retrieved from working memory, depending only on the basic working memory capacity when chunking is not invoked. Predictions from our model were confirmed by analyzing single-unit responses in epileptic patients and memory experiments with verbal material. Our work provides a novel conceptual and analytical framework for understanding how the brain organizes information in real time.

Abstract: Approximating the ground state of many-body systems is a key computational bottleneck underlying important applications in physics and chemistry. The most widely known quantum algorithm for ground state approximation, quantum phase estimation, is out of reach of current quantum processors due to its high circuit-depths. Subspace-based quantum diagonalization methods offer a viable alternative for pre- and early-fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we introduce a quantum diagonalization algorithm which combines two key ideas on quantum subspaces: a classical diagonalization based on quantum samples, and subspaces constructed with quantum Krylov states. We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial time under the working assumptions of Krylov quantum diagonalization and sparseness of the ground state. We then demonstrate the scalability of our approach by performing the largest ground-state quantum simulation of impurity models using a Heron quantum processors and the Frontier supercomputer. We consider both the single-impurity Anderson model with 41 bath sites, and a system with 4 impurities and 7 bath sites per impurity. Our results are in excellent agreement with Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations.

Title: Scalable entanglement of nuclear spins mediated by electron exchange

Abstract: The use of nuclear spins for quantum computation is limited by the difficulty in creating genuine quantum entanglement between distant nuclei. Current demonstrations of nuclear entanglement in semiconductors rely upon coupling the nuclei to a common electron, which is not a scalable strategy. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit Control-Z logic operation between the nuclei of two phosphorus atoms in a silicon device, separated by up to 20 nanometers. Each atoms binds separate electrons, whose exchange interaction mediates the nuclear two-qubit gate. We prepare and measure a nuclear Bell state with a fidelity of 76 +/- 5 $\%$ and a concurrence of 0.67 +/- 0.05. With this method, future progress in scaling up semiconductor spin qubits can be extended to the development of nuclear-spin based quantum computers.

Title: Energy transport in holographic non-conformal interfaces
Authors: Yan Liu, Chuan-Yi Wang, You-Jie Zeng
Abstract: We study energy transport in a system of two dimensional conformal field theories exchanging energy across a non-conformal interface involving a localised scalar operator, using holographic duality. By imposing the sourceless boundary condition, or equivalently, enforcing energy conservation at the interface, we show that the sum of the transmission and reflection coefficients is equal to one. Unlike conformal interfaces, we find that both the energy transmission and reflection coefficients are generally complex and frequency dependent. When the interface brane connects two distinct AdS$_2$ geometries, the transmission coefficient approaches the value expected for a conformal interface in the UV regime at high frequencies and in the IR regime at low frequencies. In the intermediate frequency range, the transmission coefficient may exhibit oscillatory behavior. Moreover, we present a nontrivial example of a fully transmissive interface, which exhibits similarities to a topological interface.

Title: Anomalous matrix product operator symmetries and 1D mixed-state phases
Authors: Xiao-Qi Sun
Abstract: Generalized symmetries have emerged as a powerful organizing principle for exotic quantum phases. However, their role in open quantum systems, especially for non-invertible cases, remains largely unexplored. We address this by applying a unified tensor-network framework for mixed states with fusion categorical symmetry, which encompasses both invertible and non-invertible ones represented as matrix product operators, and reveals novel quantum phases unique to the open-system setting through the lens of quantum anomalies. In contrast to pure states, where anomalies forbid symmetric short-range correlated phases in one dimension, we construct a broad class of renormalization fixed-point mixed states with zero correlation length given arbitrary strong anomalous fusion categorical symmetry. These states, representing nontrivial mixed-state phases of matter, cannot be efficient prepared via local quantum channels, indicating anomaly-enforced long-range entanglement in the absence of local correlations. Despite this obstruction, we further provide constructions of measurement-enhanced quantum circuits to prepare all these constructed states, offering a practical way to realize and probe anomalous generalized symmetries in open quantum systems.

Title: Direct integration of atomic precision advanced manufacturing into middle-of-line silicon fabrication

Abstract: Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure, and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance, and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance, and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology, and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.

Title: Testing Variational Perturbation Theory for Effective Actions Using the Gaudin-Yang Model
Authors: Pranav Sharma, R. J. Furnstahl
Abstract: The background field formalism based on effective actions is a compelling framework for developing an effective field theory for nuclear density functional theory. Among the challenges in carrying out this development is handling both the particle-hole and pairing channels beyond the mean-field level, which includes how to incorporate collective degrees of freedom. Here we use the exactly solvable one-dimensional Gaudin-Yang model as a theoretical laboratory to explore candidate approaches. We compare Variational Perturbation Theory (VPT) to ordinary many-body perturbation theory and the inversion method, all to second order in their respective expansions, and verify issues with Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary fields. VPT outperforms the other approaches at this level over a wide range of densities. The next steps to extend this approach toward nuclei are outlined.

Title: Extending the Limited Performance of the Quantum Refrigerator with Catalysts
Authors: Cong Fu, Ousi Pan, Zhiqiang Fan, Yushun Tang, Shanhe Su, Youhui Lin, Jincan Chen
Abstract: Quantum thermal machines offer promising platforms for exploring the fundamental limits of thermodynamics at the microscopic scale. The previous study in Ref.[1,2] demonstrated that the incorporation of a catalyst can significantly enhance the performance of a heat engine by broadening its operational regime and achieving a more favorable trade-off between work output and efficiency. Building on this powerful framework and innovative idea, here we further extend the concept to a two-stroke quantum refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold reservoir via discrete strokes powered by external work. The working medium consists of two two-level systems (TLSs) and two heat reservoirs at different temperatures and is assisted by an auxiliary system acting as a catalyst. Remarkably, the catalyst remains unchanged after each cycle, ensuring that heat extraction is driven entirely by the work input. We show that the presence of the catalyst leads to two significant enhancements: it enables the coefficient of performance (COP) and cooling capacity to exceed the Otto bound and allows the refrigerator to operate in frequency and temperature regimes that are inaccessible without a catalyst. Furthermore, through a comparison with catalytic heat engines, our analysis reveals that two distinct permutation types are necessary to simultaneously enhance the COP and operational range of refrigerators, in contrast to heat engines for which a single permutation suffices. These results highlight the potential of catalytic mechanisms to broaden the operational capabilities of quantum thermal devices and to surpass conventional thermodynamic performance limits.

Title: CbLDM: A Diffusion Model for recovering nanostructure from pair distribution function
Authors: Jiarui Cao, Zhiyang Zhang, Heming Wang, Jun Xu, Ling Lan, Ran Gu
Abstract: Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error. Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.

Title: Geometric analysis of Ising models, Part III
Authors: Michael Aizenman
Abstract: The random current representation of the Ising model, along with a related path expansion, has been a source of insight on the stochastic geometric underpinning of the ferromagnetic model's phase structure and critical behavior in different dimensions. This representation is extended here to systems with a mild amount of frustration, such as generated by disorder operators and external field of mixed signs. Further examples of the utility of such stochastic geometric representations are presented in the context of the deconfinement transition of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge model -- particularly in three dimensions-- and in streamlined proofs of correlation inequalities with wide-ranging applications.
