Title: Off-resonant photoluminescence spectroscopy of high-optical quality single photon emitters in GaN
Authors: Nilesh Dalla, Paweł Kulboka, Michał Kobecki, Jan Misiak, Paweł Prystawko, Henryk Turski, Piotr Kossacki, Tomasz Jakubczyk
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the relevance of excitation parameters on the emission from single-photon emitting defect centers in GaN. We investigate the absorption spectrum of different emitters by photoluminescence excitation technique at 10\,K. We report large spectral jumps (shifts up to 22\,meV) in the emitters' zero-phonon line (ZPL). The likelihood of such jumps is increased by the change in excitation energy. The shifts indicate a large built-in dipole moment of the defects and suggest a possibility to electrically tune their ZPL in a wide range. From the photoluminescence excitation studies, we observe that for majority of the emitters the absorption peaks exist between 2 and 2.55\,eV. The absorption peaks vary from emitter to emitter, and no universal absorption pattern is apparent. Finally, for selected emitters we observe significantly reduced spectral diffusion and instrument-limited linewidth of $138\,\mu eV$ (0.04\,nm).These findings show a new perspective for atomic defect GaN emitters as sources of coherent photons, shine new light on their energy level structure and show the possibility of tuning the ZPL, paving the way to fully harness their potential for applications in quantum technologies.

Title: Deep learning of phase transitions with minimal examples
Authors: Ahmed Abuali, David A. Clarke, Morten Hjorth-Jensen, Ioannis Konstantinidis, Claudia Ratti, Jianyi Yang
Abstract: Over the past several years, there have been many studies demonstrating the ability of neural networks and deep learning methods to identify phase transitions in many physical systems, notably in classical statistical physics systems. One often finds that the prediction of deep learning methods trained on many ensembles below and above the critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ behave analogously to an order parameter, and this analogy has been successfully used to locate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and estimate universal critical exponents. In this work, we pay particular attention to the ability of a convolutional neural network to capture these critical parameters for the 2-$d$ Ising model, when the network is trained on configurations at $T=0$ and $T=\infty$ only. We apply histogram reweighting to the neural network prediction and compare its capabilities when trained more conventionally at multiple temperatures. We find that the network trained on two temperatures is still able to identify $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $\nu$, while the extraction of $\gamma$ becomes more challenging.

Title: Kondo impurity in an attractive Fermi-Hubbard bath: Equilibrium and dynamics
Authors: Zhi-Yuan Wei, Tao Shi, J. Ignacio Cirac, Eugene A. Demler
Abstract: We investigate theoretically equilibrium and dynamical properties of a Kondo impurity coupled to either 1D or 2D superconductors, modeled by the attractive Fermi-Hubbard model. By employing a non-Gaussian variational approach, we go beyond the approximation of a constant superconducting (SC) gap. We show that dynamical properties of the system can be modified qualitatively, when space and time dependent renormalization of the SC gap and electron-impurity hybridization are included. For the ground state, we find the singlet-doublet phase transition and $\pi$-phase shifts of the SC order parameter. For dynamics, first we consider spin dynamics following an abrupt connection of the polarized impurity to the 2D bath. We find rapid relaxation of impurity polarization and directional emission of a magnetization pulse, which becomes damped as it propagates into the bulk. Then we analyze transport between two SC leads coupled through the impurity at finite bias voltage. Here we go beyond analysis of the steady state to investigate full-time dynamics following an abrupt application of the bias voltage. We uncover four distinct regimes in the transient dynamics and transport properties: (I) the AC Josephson effect regime; (II) dynamical competition between charge-density-wave (CDW) and SC orders with transient Kondo correlations; (III) the coexistence of AC and DC currents facilitated by partial Kondo screening and dynamical stabilization of the SC order; (IV) DC Kondo transport regime modified by the SC order. Regime II exhibits a dynamical transition from SC to CDW order that locally restores the U(1) symmetry. We argue that our findings for regime IV provide a theoretical explanation for the experimentally observed anomalous enhancement of DC conductance and suppression of the AC Josephson current. Finally, we discuss the potential experimental realization with ultracold atoms.

Title: Topological advantage for adsorbate chemisorption on conjugated chains
Authors: Raphael F. Ribeiro, Luis Martinez-Gomez
Abstract: Topological matter shows promise for applications in quantum information and transport. In this work, we examined the electronic and vibronic properties of a prototype molecular system adsorbed to the edges, domain walls, and the bulk of a Su-Schrieffer Hegger polyacetylene chain in the trivial, metallic, and topological phases. Our results reveal that suitable molecular observables show signatures of the topological phase transition and imply the topological phase has a significant advantage and robustness over the metallic phase for electron donation into the molecular system. This advantage persists in the presence of defects and suggests applications of topological materials in molecular catalysis and sensing.

Title: Diffusion in Quenched Random Environments: Reviving Laplace's First Law of Errors
Authors: Lucianno Defaveri, Eli Barkai
Abstract: Laplace's first law of errors, which states that the frequency of an error can be represented as an exponential function of the error magnitude, was overlooked for many decades but was recently shown to describe the statistical behavior of diffusive tracers in isordered, glassy-like media. While much is known about this behavior, a key ingredient is still missing: the relationship between this observation and diffusion in a quenched random environment. We address this problem using the trap model, deriving lower and upper bounds on the particle packet for large displacements. Our results demonstrate that both bounds exhibit Laplace-like laws. We further establish a connection between the density of energy traps $\rho(E)$, and the observed behavior, showing that the phenomenon is truly universal, albeit with constants that depend on temperature and the level of disorder.

Title: Tuning Quantum States at Chirality-Reversed Planar Interface in Weyl Semimetals using an Interstitial Layer
Authors: Eklavya Thareja, Gina Pantano, Ilya Vekhter, Jacob Gayles
Abstract: The electronic band structure of Weyl semimetals possesses pairs of linear band crossings, called Weyl nodes, characterized by opposite chirality charges associated with each node. The momentum space position of the nodes can reverse across a planar interface and these host Fermi-arc-like bound states, in addition to scattering states. We show that a magnetic interstitial layer can tune these states in three distinct ways. The electrostatic potential and one of the in-plane magnetic potential components control the shape of the bound state Fermi-arcs. For moderate values of the same in-plane magnetic potential electrons are spin-filtered across the interface, while both the in-plane magnetic components and the electrostatic potential control the transmission of electrons. The ratio of in-plane to out-of-plane magnetic components can be used to turn on or turn off the magnetic potential effects, since the latter does not affect the interface states. The tunability arises from spin-momentum locking and chirality reversal at the interface. Thus, the effects can mix or interchange depending on the specific material but the states will remain tunable.

Title: Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquids
Authors: Yuji Matsuda, Takasada Shibauchi, Hae-Young Kee
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum spins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute zero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant fractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials. This field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations, topological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare exactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin degrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an applied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically non-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering potential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian character of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection to certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could manifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and ruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In particular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and topological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This review presents a comprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a particular focus on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is to inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current literature and perspectives.

Title: A reduced-temperature process for preparing atomically clean Si(100) and SiGe(100) surfaces with vapor HF
Authors: Luis Fabián Peña, Evan M. Anderson, John P. Mudrick, Samantha G. Rosenberg, David A. Scrymgeour, Ezra Bussmann, Shashank Misra
Abstract: Silicon processing techniques such as atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) and epitaxial growth require surface preparations that activate oxide desorption (typically >1000 $^{\circ}$C) and promote surface reconstruction toward atomically-clean, flat, and ordered Si(100)-2$\times$1. We compare aqueous and vapor phase cleaning of Si and Si/SiGe surfaces to prepare APAM-ready and epitaxy-ready surfaces at lower temperatures. Angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicate that vapor hydrogen fluoride (VHF) cleans dramatically reduce carbon surface contamination and allow the chemically prepared surface to reconstruct at lower temperatures, 600 $^{\circ}$C for Si and 580 $^{\circ}$C for a Si/Si$_{0.7}$Ge$_{0.3}$ heterostructures, into an ordered atomic terrace structure indicated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). After thermal treatment and vacuum hydrogen termination, we demonstrate STM hydrogen desorption lithography (HDL) on VHF-treated Si samples, creating reactive zones that enable area-selective chemistry using a thermal budget similar to CMOS process flows. We anticipate these results will establish new pathways to integrate APAM with Si foundry processing.

Title: Instability of the ferromagnetic phase under random fields in an Ising spin glass with correlated disorder
Authors: Hidetoshi Nishimori
Abstract: It is well established that the ferromagnetic phase remains stable under random magnetic fields in three and higher dimensions for the ferromagnetic Ising model and the Edwards-Anderson model of spin glasses without correlation in the disorder variables. We investigate an Ising spin glass with correlated disorder and demonstrate that the ferromagnetic phase on the Nishimori line becomes unstable under random fields in any dimension, provided that magnetic field chaos exists in the Edwards-Anderson model on the same lattice. This result underscores the profound impact of spatial correlations in the disorder. Additionally, we show that this instability can also be attributed to disorder (bond) chaos. Furthermore, we argue that the model with correlated disorder remains in the ferromagnetic phase even in the presence of symmetry-breaking fields, as long as the Edwards-Anderson model on the same lattice exhibits a spin glass phase under a magnetic field. These findings reveal fundamentally different properties of the ferromagnetic phase in models with correlation in disorder compared to those without.

Title: Atomic-resolution structural and spectroscopic evidence for the synthetic realization of two-dimensional copper boride
Authors: Hui Li, Qiyuan Ruan, Cataldo Lamarca, Albert Tsui, Boris I. Yakobson, Mark C. Hersam
Abstract: Since the first realization of borophene on Ag(111), two-dimensional (2D) boron nanomaterials have attracted significant interest due to their polymorphic diversity and potential for hosting solid-state quantum phenomena. Here, we use atomic-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and field-emission resonance (FER) spectroscopy to elucidate the structure and properties of atomically thin boron phases grown on Cu(111). Specifically, FER spectroscopy reveals unique charge transfer and electronic states compared to the distinct borophene phases observed on silver, suggesting that the deposition of boron on copper can result in strong covalent bonding characteristic of a 2D copper boride. This conclusion is reinforced by detailed STM characterization of line defects that are consistent with density functional theory (DFT) calculations for atomically thin Cu8B14. This evidence for 2D copper boride is likely to motivate future synthetic efforts aimed at expanding the relatively unexplored family of atomically thin metal boride materials.

Title: Towards optimization of the Josephson diode effect
Authors: Michiyasu Mori, Wataru Koshibae, Sadamichi Maekawa
Abstract: We theoretically study the Josephson diode effect in the junction of singlet superconductors separated by the Rashba system in the in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the applied current. The coupling energy of two superconductors is analytically calculated using a tunneling Hamiltonian with a one-dimensional model. It is found that the critical current is asymmetric with respect to the current and the magnetic field, i.e., Josephson diode effect. Depending on a distance between the superconducting electrodes $d$, the Josephson diode effect changes its magnitude and sign. The magnitude is inversely proportional to a band split caused by the spin-orbit interaction. Since $d$ is experimentally controllable, the Josephson diode effect can be optimized by tuning of $d$. Our theory develops a new guiding principle to design the Josephson diode device

Title: Band structure evolution from kagome to Lieb under periodic driving field
Authors: Gulshan Kumar, Shashikant Kumar, Prakash Parida
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the light-induced transition of the kagome quasienergy spectrum to the Lieb like band structure under periodic driving fields. A generalized framework for the renormalized hopping potential is derived, applicable to any two-dimensional lattice with arbitrary field polarizations. By applying this framework to a kagome lattice driven by linearly polarized light in off-resonant condition, we demonstrate the ability to tune the hopping strength along specific bonds to zero. This tuning induces the merging of Dirac points at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, governed by the field parameters. At specific parameter values, this merging facilitates a transition from the kagome quasienergy spectrum to the Lieb band structure with reduced bandwidth. Our results highlight the critical role of controlled electron hopping in driving this electronic transition, offering valuable insights into the manipulation of electronic properties in periodically driven systems.

Title: Extrinsic nonlinear acoustic valley Hall effect in the massive Dirac materials
Authors: Jia-Liang Wan, Ying-Li Wu, Ke-Qiu Chen, Xiao-Qin Yu
Abstract: The nonlinear acoustic valley Hall effect (AVHE), a recently discovered novel acoustically driven phenomena, has sparked extensive interests in valleytronics. So far, only the intrinsic contributions from band structure (Berry curvature or asymmetric energy dispersions) to nonlinear AVHE have been investigated. Here, we theoretically investigate the nonlinear AVHE from both intrinsic and extrinsic contributions in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal massive Dirac materials with disorders based on the Boltzmann formalism and also concretely analyse the behaviours of nonlinear AVHE in disordered monolayer MoS2. It's found that the extrinsic contributions (side jump and skew scattering) can also give rise to a pure nonlinear AVHE in the 2D hexagonal massive Dirac materials. Remarkably, the extrinsic mechanisms dominate the nonlinear AVHE in the disordered monolayer MoS2.

Title: Unconventional enhancement of anomalous Hall effect by tilt of Zeeman field in topologically-nontrivial MXenes, $M_2M'$C$_2$O$_2$
Authors: Tetsuro Habe
Abstract: In this paper, the anomalous Hall effect of topologically-nontrivial MXenes, $M_2M'$C$_2$O$_2$, and the electronic structure in the presence of magnetic proximity effect is theoretically investigated. The theoretical analysis is performed in two different ways: an effective model and a multi-orbital tight-binding model generated from the first-principles band structure. These two theoretical methods provided the similar profile of Berry curvature for electronic states near the bulk band gap, and they show an unconventional rise of hollowed-out peak in the profile with the tilt of proximity magnetic potential. The anomalous Hall conductivity is also calculated as a function of the charge density and the tilt angle of proximity magnetic order. Then, an unconventional enhancement of anomalous Hall conductivity by the tilt of magnetic order is theoretically predicted as a result of the variation of Berry curvature.

Title: Structural transition and emission enhancement in vacancy ordered halide double perovskite Cs$_2$TeCl$_6$ under pressure
Authors: Suvashree Mukherjee, Debabrata Samanta, Bidisha Mukherjee, Konstantin Glazyrin, Goutam Dev Mukherjee
Abstract: The effect of pressure on the structural evolution, enhancement of photoluminescence intensity and optical band gap of a vacancy ordered double halide perovskite Cs$_2$TeCl$_6$ is investigated systematically. We use synchrotron x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, optical band gap and photoluminescence measurements to explore the structural and the optical properties of Cs$_2$TeCl$_6$ under pressure up to 30.0 GPa. We find that Cs$_2$TeCl$_6$ undergoes a structural transition from cubic Fm$\bar{3}$m to monoclinic P2$_1$/n at very low pressure below 1.0 GPa. A significant increase in photoluminescence intensity and a rapid decrease in optical band gap are observed, which are related to the octahedral distortion and structural transition. Interestingly, with increasing pressure, the sample regains its ambient Fm$\bar{3}$m structure at around 3.4 GPa maintaining the cubic phase up to 30.0 GPa. The sample undergoes an iso-structural transition at around 14.1 GPa pressure with a slight decrease in compressibility.

Title: Impact of electron beam propagation on high-resolution quantitative chemical analysis of 1 nm-thick GaN/AlGaN quantum wells
Authors: Florian Castioni, Patrick Quéméré, Sergi Cuesta, Vincent Delaye, Pascale Bayle-Guillemaud, Eva Monroy, Eric Robin, Nicolas Bernier
Abstract: Recent advancements in high-resolution spectroscopy analyses within the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) have paved the way for measuring the concentration of chemical species in crystalline materials at the atomic scale. However, several artifacts complicate the direct interpretation of experimental data. For instance, in the case of energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, the linear dependency of local x-ray emission on composition is disrupted by channeling effects and cross-talk during electron beam propagation. To address these challenges, it becomes necessary to adopt an approach that combines experimental data with inelastic scattering simulations. This method aims to account for the effects of electron beam propagation on x-ray emission, essentially determining the quantity and the spatial origin of the collected signal. In this publication, we propose to assess the precision and sensitivity limits of this approach in a practical case study involving a focused ion beam (FIB)-prepared III-N multilayers device. The device features nominally pure ~1.5-nm thick GaN quantum wells surrounded by AlGaN barriers containing a low concentration of aluminum (~5 at. %). By employing atomic-scale EDX acquisitions based on the averaging of more than several thousand frames, calibrated $\zeta$-factors combined with a multi-layer x-ray absorption correction model for quantification, and by comparing the x-ray radiation obtained from the quantum well with a reference 10-nm thick structure, we demonstrate that the quantitative impact of beam propagation on chemical composition can be precisely accounted for, resulting in a composition sensitivity at the atomic scale as low as +-0.25 at.%. Finally, practical aspects to achieve this high precision level are discussed, particularly in terms of inelastic multislice simulation, uncertainty determination, and sample quality.

Title: Mangnon-Phonon-Photon Interactions in Cubic Ferromagnets in the Vicinity of Orientational Phase Transition: Retrospective and Phenomenological Study
Authors: I.V. Bychkov, D.A. Kuzmin, V.A. Tolkachev, V.D. Buchelnikov, V.G. Shavrov
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation of magnon-phonon-photon interactions in cubic ferromagnets near orientational phase transitions (OPT). The study focuses on the interplay of magnetoelastic (ME), electromagnetic-spin (EMS), and acousticelectromagnetic (AEM) interactions in ferromagnetic dielectrics and metals. By deriving dispersion equations for coupled waves, the research reveals how the dynamic properties of magnetically ordered crystals evolve in response to these interactions under varying external magnetic fields and near OPT points. The ME interaction prominently influences spin and elastic wave dynamics, giving rise to coupled modes such as quasimagnon and quasi-acoustic waves. Near the OPT, these interactions become dominant, leading to phenomena like the magnetoelastic gap and softening of vibrational modes. The EMS interaction significantly alters the activation energy and dispersion of quasi-spin and quasi-electromagnetic waves. In ferromagnetic metals, helicons (weakly damped electromagnetic waves) exhibit strong coupling with spin and elastic waves, particularly in the OPT region. The study identifies conditions for triple resonance among spin, elastic, and electromagnetic waves. Additionally, it explores the frequency-dependent rotation of polarization planes in electromagnetic and magnetoelastic waves, which sharpens near OPT points. These results provide a deeper understanding of the coupled dynamics in ferromagnetic materials, paving the way for new technological applications in spintronics, signal processing, and advanced magneto-optical devices. The theoretical framework developed here emphasizes the critical role of ME, EMS, and AEM interactions in tailoring wave properties for specific applications, particularly in designing next-generation magnetic and electronic systems.

Title: Bogolon mediated light absorption in multi-component BEC with $Z_2$ symmetry
Authors: Xinyu Zhu, Meng Sun
Abstract: We investigate the light absorption process in a coherently coupled two-component Bose-Einstein condensate model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in different dimensionality at zero temperature. As the analogue of phonon in the solid state physics, the elementary excitation of the Bose-Einstein condensate is described by Bogoliubov quasiparticle or bogolon for short. Due to the small magnitude of the sound velocity of the bogolon, the light absorption process is prohibited by the conservation of energy and momentum. To surmount this depression, the additional degree of freedom must be considered inside of the simple Bose gas model. In this article, we develop a microscopical theory of electromagnetic power absorption by a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate and investigate the absorption rate dependence in different dimensions. Our calculation shows the possibility of manipulating the absorption property by tuning the parameters of the condensates.

Title: Magnetism based on nitrate-nitrate interactions: The cases of LiNO$_3$, K$_{0.5}$Rb$_{0.5}$NO$_3$, Ca(NO$_3$)$_2$ and C(NH$_2$)$_3$NO$_3$
Authors: Na Du, Xintian Wang, Ruo Tong Wang, Enting Xu, Yu Ying Zhu, Yan Zhao, Peng Ren, Fei Yen
Abstract: Long-range magnetic ordering of the orbital motion of oxygen atoms within NO$_3$$^-$ cations is identified from experimental measurements of the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$($T$) in LiNO$_3$, Ca(NO$_3$)$_2$, K$_{0.5}$Rb$_{0.5}$NO$_3$ and C(NH$_2$)$_3$NO$_3$ at their respective order-disorder, solid-solid phase transitions $T$$_N$. The observed sharp changes in $\chi$($T$) and accompanying hysteretic behavior indicate the phase transitions to be first order. A model employing the law of conservation of angular momentum is used to explain why the librations between neighboring NO$_3$$^-$ become geared below $T$$_N$. Since the periodic motions involve concerted motion of net charges, the associated magnetic moments of the NO$_3$$^-$ ions indirectly establish an antiferromagnetic structure below $T$$_N$. Our findings identify a previously unidentified type of molecular interaction which may be exploited to further increase the enthalpy of the widely-popular hydrated salts employed as energy storage devices.

Title: Hexatic Phase in Covalent Two-Dimensional Silver Iodide

Abstract: According to the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory, the transition from a solid to liquid in two dimensions (2D) proceeds through an orientationally ordered liquid-crystal-like hexatic phase. While experiments have confirmed the KTHNY melting scenario in some 2D systems such as crystals of skyrmions and of noble gas atoms, no evidence has previously been found for it in covalently bonded 2D crystals. Here, 2D crystals of silver iodide embedded in multi-layer graphene are studied with in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Near the melting point, a highly dynamic state of AgI emerges that we show to be the first observation of the hexatic phase in covalent 2D materials.

Title: Electrostatic interactions between anisotropic particles
Authors: Harshit Joshi, Anubhab Roy
Abstract: We investigate the electrostatic interactions between two charged anisotropic conductors using a combination of asymptotic and numerical methods. For widely separated particles, we employ the method of reflections to analyze the interactions. Although the formulation applies to conductors of arbitrary shapes, it is specifically implemented for spheroid-sphere systems to capture anisotropy effects in a simple configuration. In near-contact cases with axisymmetric configurations, the lubrication approximation is used to extend the analysis. Additionally, we develop a Boundary Integral Method (BIM) to study particle interactions at arbitrary separations, validating the results with asymptotic solutions for both near and far fields. We derive analytical expressions for the electrostatic force and torque on a spheroid due to another spheroid in the far-field regime. When combined with hydrodynamic effects, the electrostatic torque competes with the hydrodynamically favourable alignments of a pair of settling spheroids in certain regions while reinforcing them in others. Consequently, the inclusion of electrostatic effects may influence the instability observed in dilute suspensions of spheroids.

Title: Development and Comparison of Model-Based and Data-Driven Approaches for the Prediction of the Mechanical Properties of Lattice Structures
Authors: Chiara Pasini, Oscar Ramponi, Stefano Pandini, Luciana Sartore, Giulia Scalet
Abstract: Lattice structures have great potential for several application fields ranging from medical and tissue engineering to aeronautical one. Their development is further speeded up by the continuing advances in additive manufacturing technologies that allow to overcome issues typical of standard processes and to propose tailored designs. However, the design of lattice structures is still challenging since their properties are considerably affected by numerous factors. The present paper aims to propose, discuss, and compare various modeling approaches to describe, understand, and predict the correlations between the mechanical properties and the void volume fraction of different types of lattice structures fabricated by fused deposition modeling 3D printing. Particularly, four approaches are proposed: (i) a simplified analytical model; (ii) a semi-empirical model combining analytical equations with experimental correction factors; (iii) an artificial neural network trained on experimental data; (iv) numerical simulations by finite element analyses. The comparison among the various approaches, and with experimental data, allows to identify the performances, advantages, and disadvantages of each approach, thus giving important guidelines for choosing the right design methodology based on the needs and available data.

Title: First-principles Investigation of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$: A Multifunctional Heteroanionic Oxychalcogenide for Photocatalytic and Thermoelectric Applications
Authors: G. Thamizharasan, R. D. Eithiraj
Abstract: The development of industrial growth raises global energy demand. Novel materials with promising unorthodox features satiate and demand for sustainable, non-toxic, and cost-effective energy. A first-principles investigation were carried out to ground state and transport properties of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ towards energy harvesting and photocatalytic applications was carried out. In groundstate the CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ showed good mechanically stable with a volume of \(1138.235 \, \textÅ^3\) and a high elastic modulus of \(215.73 \, \text{GPa}\). Further, the electronic properties of \(\mathrm{CaV_2TeO_8}\), PBE-GGA exchange-correlation was utilized, demonstrates direct and indirect transitions with a wide bandgap of 2.7 and 2.8 eV, indicating its semiconducting nature. Photoinduced charge carriers were investigated through Deformation Potential Theory (DPT) to estimate the mobility of charge carriers, excitonic radius, and effective mass. Axial anisotropic strain in band degeneracy and shifts in the S-Y and Y-\Gamma transitions offer a \(3.17 \, \textÅ\) Frenkel-type strongly bound exciton with a high carrier mobility of \(2409.91 \, \text{cm}^2 \, \text{V}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}\) electrons and \(316.46 \, \text{cm}^2 \, \text{V}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}\) holes respectively. To estimate the feasibility of \(\mathrm{CaV_2TeO_8}\) in photocatalysis, we examined the conduction and valence band edges under harsh pH conditions within PBE-GGA exchange-correlation functionals. The band edges of \(\mathrm{CaV_2TeO_8}\) show the halfway reaction for hydrogen evolution with reference to the Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE). Moreover, the Boltzmann equation interface was used to investigate the transport and thermoelectric properties. A high Seebeck coefficient in \(\mathrm{CaV_2TeO_8}\) at \(300 \, \text{K}\) directs a thermoelectric figure of merit of \(0.94\).

Title: Relationship between the boson peak and first sharp diffraction peak in glasses

Abstract: Boson peak (BP) dynamics refers to the universal excitation in the terahertz region of glass. In this study, the universal dynamics of BP were quantitatively evaluated in various glassy materials based on the heterogeneous elasticity theory (HET), and the determinants of BP were successfully extracted. A strong correlation was observed between the maximum possible coarse-graining wavenumber, which is a determinant of the BP in the HET, and the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) wavenumber, which is a characteristic index of the medium-range order in glasses. The results indicate that the behaviour of BP in glass can be quantitatively understood in the following two steps. First, the FSDP representing the largest structural correlation in glass is dominantly used to determine the unit size of the elastic modulus heterogeneity, and second, the magnitude of the elastic modulus fluctuation is used to determine the frequency and intensity of the BP.

Title: Self-generated time crystal in hybrid Josephson junctions
Authors: M. Nashaat, J. Tekić, Yu. M. Shukrinov
Abstract: Time crystals represent a non-equilibrium state of matter with broken time-translation symmetry that repeats itself at regular time intervals. Though initially envisioned as a self-generated and self-sustained periodic motion, their realization has usually required the utilization of external periodic inputs or modulations. While at first it looked like, for a time crystal to exist, the initial proposal had to be abandoned, the recent evidence of inherent time crystals is bringing back the idea of self-generated time crystal under the spotlight. In this work, we demonstrate the appearance of a self-generated space-time crystalline order in hybrid Josephson junctions with the ferromagnet interface without any external influence. The presence of the exchange and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a ferromagnet with broken structural inversion symmetry modifies the current phase relation and the critical current due to the coupling between the magnetic moment and Josephson phase. This breaks the time translation symmetry leading to the appearance of the time-crystalline order in the spatiotemporal dependence of superconducting current, which evolves with the double of the modulation frequency. Due to its unique origin and properties, this inherent time crystalline order stands out from the commonly known classification of time crystals into discrete and continuous ones. A self-generated time crystal is demonstrated in two types of hybrid Josephson junctions: the superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor on a topological insulator and the superconductor-three layer ferromagnet-superconductor. Further, we also show that a recently developed magnetometry device that visualizes a supercurrent flow in the Josephson junction at the nanoscale can be used as a platform for experimental detection of space-time crystalline order in hybrid Josephson junctions.

Title: High order strong-coupling expansion for X-ray absorption on a dynamically screened impurity
Authors: Eva Paprotzki, Martin Eckstein
Abstract: Time-resolved X-ray absorption can reveal the dynamical screening of the local Coulomb interaction in strongly correlated photo-excited materials. Here, we focus on the theoretical prediction of X-ray absorption in the presence of dynamical screening using the strong coupling expansion, i.e., an expansion around the isolated absorption site in terms of the retarded interaction. The evaluation of higher order diagrams is made numerically feasible by an approach based on the decomposition of the retarded interaction into complex exponentials. With this, we evaluate the strong coupling series to third order on an electron-boson model of Holstein type. We demonstrate that in relevant coupling regimes, even low orders of the strong coupling expansion can give a significant correction over the previously used lowest order approximation.

Title: Pump-driven opto-magnetic properties in semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides: an analytical model
Authors: Habib Rostami, Federico Cilento, Emmanuele Cappelluti
Abstract: Single-layer transition-metal dichalcogenides provide an unique intrinsic entanglement between the spin/valley/orbital degrees of freedom and the polarization of scattered photons. This scenario gives rise to the well-assessed optical dichroism observed by using both steady and time-resolved probes. In this paper we provide a compact analytical modelling of the onset of a finite Faraday/Kerr optical rotation upon shining with a circularly polarized light. We identify different optical features displaying optical rotation at different characteristic energies, and we describe in an analytical framework the time-dependence of their intensities as a consequence of the main spin-conserving and spin-flip processes.

Title: Large spin accumulation signals in ultrafast magneto-optical experiments
Authors: Alberto Anadón, Harjinder Singh, Eva Díaz, Yann Le-Guen, Julius Hohlfeld, Richard B. Wilson, Gregory Malinowski, Michel Hehn, Jon Gorchon
Abstract: Magneto-optical techniques have become essential tools in spintronics, enabling the investigation of spin dynamics in the ultrafast regime. A key challenge in this field has been to accurately isolate the contributions to magneto-optical signals of spin transport phenomena from the local magnetization dynamics. The contribution of transported and accumulated spins was long believed to be orders of magnitude smaller than that of the magnetization and thus previous approaches to disentangle these signals have relied on specific experimental designs, usually including thick metal layers. Here, we present experimental evidence demonstrating that the magneto-optical signal from ultrafast spin accumulations can, under certain conditions, be comparable to or even exceed that of the magnetic layer in a standard ultrafast demagnetization experiment. Our findings provide a new framework for accessing and isolating these spin accumulations, allowing for time and depth dependent probing of transported spin and/or orbital angular momentum.

Title: Dynamical Spreading Under Power Law Potential
Authors: Ido Fanto, Naomi Oppenheimer
Abstract: We examine the dynamic spreading of a dense overdamped suspension of particles under power law repulsive potentials, often called Riesz gases. That is, potentials that decay with distance as 1/r^k where k\in (-2,\infty]. Depending on the value of k relative to the system's spatial dimension $D$, the potentials are categorized as short-ranged for k > D, and long-ranged when $k \leq D$. Such systems naturally occur in contexts involving particle suspensions, granular media, and charged systems, where interactions can be influenced by physical fields that decrease over distance. Our analytical findings reveal that the particles spread in a self-similar form, with the radius growing with time as t^1/(k+2). The theoretical predictions derived for a general dimension D, are verified by numerical simulations involving thousands of particles in free space, in both one and two dimensions. Furthermore, the simulations not only confirm our analytical results but also reveal a rich diversity of behaviors depending on the value of k. We demonstrate that the density profiles differ significantly depending on whether k is larger than, smaller than, or equal to D-2, where D is the dimension. For k>D-2 the density is centered in the middle and we also notice a Wigner lattice emerging as a result of the repulsive interactions, for k = D-2, density is uniform and for k<D-2, density is centered at the edges. This new classification indicates that the long/short-range classification is insufficient for predicting the density profile of the suspension. When k<D-2, we observed an interesting phenomenon when two or more suspensions are placed near each other: a particle-free zone is formed where the two populations meet, resembling structures of bubbles.

Title: Observation of transverse Thomson effect
Authors: Atsushi Takahagi, Takamasa Hirai, Abdulkareem Alasli, Sang Jun Park, Hosei Nagano, Ken-ichi Uchida
Abstract: The thermoelectric Thomson effect, predicted in the 1850s by William Thomson, produces volumetric heating/cooling in a conductor due to the concerted action of the Seebeck and Peltier effects. Recently, transverse thermoelectrics studies on the Nernst and Ettingshausen effects have progressed rapidly to enable versatile thermal management technologies and to explore topological transport properties. However, a transverse Thomson effect, arising from the concerted action of the Nernst and Ettingshausen effects, has not yet been observed. Here, we report the observation of the transverse Thomson effect in a conductor. We observed volumetric heating/cooling in a semimetallic Bi$_{88}$Sb$_{12}$ alloy induced by a charge current, temperature gradient, and magnetic field applied orthogonally to each other using thermoelectric imaging techniques. We found that the heating/cooling can be switched by the field direction. Our experiments and analyses reveal the essential difference between the conventional and transverse Thomson effects; the former depends sorely on the temperature derivative of the Seebeck coefficient, while the latter depends not only on the temperature derivative of the Nernst coefficient but also on its magnitude. The observation of the transverse Thomson effect fills a missing piece in the history of thermoelectrics and provides a new principle for active thermal management technologies.

Title: Automatic detection of single-electron regime of quantum dots and definition of virtual gates using U-Net and clustering
Authors: Yui Muto, Michael R. Zielewski, Motoya Shinozaki, Kosuke Noro, Tomohiro Otsuka
Abstract: To realize practical quantum computers, a large number of quantum bits (qubits) will be required. Semiconductor spin qubits offer advantages such as high scalability and compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies. However, as the number of qubits increases, manual qubit tuning becomes infeasible, motivating automated tuning approaches. In this study, we use U-Net, a neural network method for object detection, to identify charge transition lines in experimental charge stability diagrams. The extracted charge transition lines are analyzed using the Hough transform to determine their positions and angles. Based on this analysis, we obtain the transformation matrix to virtual gates. Furthermore, we identify the single-electron regime by clustering the Hough transform outputs. We also show the single-electron regime within the virtual gate space. These sequential processes are performed automatically. This approach will advance automated control technologies for large-scale quantum devices.

Title: Discovery of sustainable energy materials via the machine-learned material space
Authors: Malte Grunert, Max Großmann, Erich Runge
Abstract: Does a machine learning model actually gain an understanding of the material space? We answer this question in the affirmative on the example of the OptiMate model, a graph attention network trained to predict the optical properties of semiconductors and insulators. By applying the UMAP dimensionality reduction technique to its latent embeddings, we demonstrate that the model captures a nuanced and interpretable representation of the materials space, reflecting chemical and physical principles, without any user-induced bias. This enables clustering of almost 10,000 materials based on optical properties and chemical similarities. Beyond this understanding, we demonstrate how the learned material space can be used to identify more sustainable alternatives to critical materials in energy-related technologies, such as photovoltaics. These findings demonstrate the dual utility of machine learning models in materials science: Accurately predicting material properties while providing insights into the underlying materials space. The approach demonstrates the broader potential of leveraging learned materials spaces for the discovery and design of materials for diverse applications, and is easily applicable to any state-of-the-art machine learning model.

Title: Phase diagram of two-component mean-field Bose mixtures
Authors: Oskar Stachowiak, Pawel Jakubczyk
Abstract: We revisit the structure of the phase diagram of the two-component mean-field Bose mixture at finite temperatures, considering both the cases of attractive and repulsive interspecies interactions. In particular, we analyze the evolution of the phase diagram upon driving the system towards collapse and point out its distinctive features in this limit. We provide analytical insights into the global structure of the phase diagram and the properties of the phase transitions between the normal phase and the phases involving Bose-Einstein condensates. \emph{Inter alia} we analytically demonstrate that for sufficiently weak interspecies interactions $a_{12}$ the system generically exhibits a line of quadruple points but has no triple nor tricritical points in the phase diagram spanned by the chemical potentials $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$ and temperature $T$. In contrast, for sufficiently large, positive values of $a_{12}$, the system displays both triple and tricritical points but no quadruple points. As pointed out in recent studies, in addition to the phase transitions involving condensation, the mixture may be driven through a liquid-gas type transition, and we clarify the conditions for its occurrence. We finally discuss the impact of interaction- and mass-imbalance on the phase diagram of the mixture.

Title: Strain-tuning of spin anisotropy in single-layer phosphorene: insights from Elliott-Yafet and Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation rates
Authors: Paulina Jureczko, Marko Milivojević, Marcin Kurpas
Abstract: Materials and systems that exhibit persistent spin texture provide a platform for creating robust spin states that can be used in quantum computing, memory storage, and other advanced technological applications. In this paper we show that persistent spin-texture in single-layer phosphorene electrons close to the $\Gamma$ point, subjected to the finite perpendicular electric field, can be achieved by appropriately tuning the extrinsic spin-orbit coupling strength using the tensile strain of about $1.2\%$ in the zigzag direction. This is confirmed by detailed numerical investigations of the effects of strain on the intrinsic and extrinsic spin-orbit coupling, and by the effective spin-orbit Hamiltonian of phosphorene electrons and holes around the $\Gamma$ point, assuming the presence of the perpendicular electric field. Furthermore, the calculated spin relaxation rates due to the Dyakonov-Perel mechanism indicate a giant anisotropy of the in-plane spin, up to $10^5$, which is directly related to the discovered persistent spin texture of phosphorene electrons close to the $\Gamma$ point. %%%%%%%% We also show, that strain can reverse the anisotropy of spin mixing parameter $b^2$ connected to the Elliott-Yafet spin relaxation mechanism which dominates spin relaxation in phosphorene. We find the conditions under which Elliott-Yafet spin lifetime anisotropy can be largely enhanced due to synergy of spin mixing and g-factor anisotropy. %%%%%%%%%% Our results suggest that spin texture in phosphorene can be modulated by strain, enabling its potential usage in the field of spintronics.

Title: Finite-size scaling in the ageing dynamics of the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model
Authors: Malte Henkel
Abstract: Single-time and two-time correlators are computed exactly in the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model after a quench to zero temperature and on a periodic chain of finite length $N$, using a simple analytical continuation technique. Besides the general confirmation of finite-size scaling in non-equilibrium dynamics, this allows to test the scaling behaviour of the plateau height $C_{\infty}^{(2)}$ to which the two-time auto-correlator converges, when deep into the finite-size regime.

Title: Evaluating SCAN and r$^2$SCAN meta-GGA functionals for predicting transition temperatures in antiferromagnetic materials
Authors: Nafise Rezaei, Mojtaba Alaei, Artem R. Oganov
Abstract: Recent advancements in exchange-correlation functionals within density functional theory highlight the need for rigorous validation across diverse types of materials properties. In this study, we assess the performance of the newly developed meta-GGA r$^2$SCAN and its predecessor, SCAN, in predicting the Néel transition temperature of antiferromagnetic materials. Our analysis includes 48 magnetic materials, spanning both simple and complex systems. Using DFT, we compute the energies of various magnetic configurations and extract exchange interaction parameters through a least-squares fitting approach. These parameters are then used in classical Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the transition temperatures. Our results demonstrate that both SCAN and r$^2$SCAN greatly outperform standard GGA and GGA+$U$ methods, yielding predictions that closely align with experimental values. The Pearson correlation coefficients for SCAN and r$^2$SCAN are 0.97 and 0.98, respectively, when compared to experimental transition temperatures. Additionally, we calculate the energy differences between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic configurations to assess the performance of the hybrid HSE06 functional. We found that the HSE06 functional underestimates transition temperatures compared to the meta-GGA functionals and experimental values.

Title: The Kekul\'e-Kitaev model: linear and non-linear responses and magnetic field effects
Authors: Mohammad-Kazem Negahdari, Abdollah Langari
Abstract: The Kekulé-Kitaev model, an extension of the Kitaev model, exhibits quantum spin liquid (QSL) properties, which has an exact solution through Kitaev parton construction. In this study, we calculate the dynamical spin structure factor as a linear response and the third-order magnetic susceptibility as a nonlinear response using two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy for Kekulé-Kitaev model. Our results reveal that the few-matter fermion excitations approximation provides reliable results for both linear and nonlinear responses. Notably, while the Kekulé-Kitaev model shows linear and nonlinear responses qualitatively similar to the Kitaev model, it displays distinct behavior under a weak uniform/staggered magnetic field. Specifically, the Kekulé-Kitaev model does not present a non-Abelian phase under a uniform magnetic field, while such phase appears in the presence of a staggered magnetic field. Interestingly, within the non-Abelian phase, signals originating from two non-adjacent fluxes in the nonlinear response are stronger than signals from other flux excitations. Furthermore, We demonstrate that the ground state of the Kekulé-Kitaev model at isotropic coupling is mapped, through unitary spin rotations, to an excited state of the Kitaev model with a uniform flux configuration.

Title: Tailoring the Glucose Oxidation Activity of Anodized Copper Films on Microfabricated Platforms
Authors: Filippo Franceschini, Catarina Fernandes, Koen Schouteden, Jon Ustarroz, Jean Pierre Locquet, Irene Taurino
Abstract: Glucose oxidation is a key reaction in biosensing and energy conversion, with anodized copper electrodes showing great potential as catalysts for its enhancement. This study explores the relationship between anodization parameters and glucose oxidation on thin copper films, providing valuable insights for optimization. By adjusting anodization parameters, specific species such as Cu2O, Cu(OH)2, and CuO can be selectively formed, each exhibiting different catalytic activities. Applying polarization in 1 M KOH at 0 V (vs Ag|AgCl) generates a highly active CuO surface layer, leading to significant performance improvements over bare copper electrodes. Specifically, sensitivity increases by 55% in the 0.1 mM-0.5 mM range and 73% in the 0.75 mM-2 mM range. Additionally, the electrodes demonstrate an exceptionally low detection limit of just 0.004 mM. These results are attributed to scalable, reproducible manufacturing on cleanroom-compatible platforms. This study not only sheds light on the effects of thin copper film anodization on glucose oxidation but also provides a practical approach for enhancing the efficiency of copper-based systems in biosensing and energy conversion applications.

Title: Two-quanta processes in coupled double-quantum-dot cavity systems
Authors: Tatiana Mihaescu, Aurelian Isar, Mihai A Macovei
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of a compound sample consisting from a semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) system non-linearly coupled with a leaking single-mode micro-resonator is theoretically investigated. The focus is on the resonance condition when the transition frequency of the double quantum dot equals to the doubled resonator frequency, respectively, and the resulting interplay among the involved phonon or photon channels. As a result, the steady-state quantum dynamics of this complex non-linear system exhibits a variety of possible effects that have been demonstrated here. Particularly, we have found the relationship among the electrical current through the double quantum dot and the microwave field inside the resonator that is nonlinearly coupled to it, with a corresponding emphasizing on their critical behaviors. Additionally, the quantum correlations of the photon flux generated into the resonator mode vary from super-Poissonian to Poissonian photon statistics, leading to single-qubit lasing phenomena at microwave frequencies.

Title: Cellular dynamics emerging from turbulent flows steered by active filaments
Authors: Mehrana R. Nejad, Julia M. Yeomans, Sumesh P Thampi
Abstract: We develop a continuum theory to describe the collective dynamics of deformable epithelial cells, using two tensor order parameters to distinguish the force-generating active filaments in the cells from their shape. The theory demonstrates how active flows create nematic domains of anisotropic cells, drive active turbulence, and create topological defects. We show that the filament flow-aligning parameter, $\lambda_{\tens{Q}}$, a rheological quantity that determines the response of the filaments to velocity gradients in the active flows, plays a significant, to date unappreciated, role in determining the pattern of extensional and compressional active flows. In a contractile cell layer, local flows are expected to align elongated cells perpendicular to the active filaments. However, with increasing $\lambda_{\tens{Q}}$, long-range correlations in the active turbulent flow field lead to extended regions where this alignment is parallel, as recently observed in experiments on confluent MDCK cell layers. Further, the two order parameter formalism allows us to distinguish defects in the filament director field, which contribute to the active driving, and those in the shape director field, measured in experiments, which are advected by the active flows. By considering the relative orientations of shape and filaments we are able to explain the surprising observation of defects moving towards their heads in contractile cell layers.

Yang, Byunghoon Kim, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Sugata Chowdhury, Arun Bansil, Hua Zhang, Tay-Rong Chang, Mark Fischer, Titus Neupert, Luis Balicas, M. Zahid Hasan
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides are a family of quasi-two-dimensional materials that display a high technological potential due to their wide range of electronic ground states, e.g., from superconducting to semiconducting, depending on the chemical composition, crystal structure, or electrostatic doping. Here, we unveil that by tuning a single parameter, the hydrostatic pressure P, a cascade of electronic phase transitions can be induced in the few-layer transition metal dichalcogenide 1T'-WS2, including superconducting, topological, and anomalous Hall effect phases. Specifically, as P increases, we observe a dual phase transition: the suppression of superconductivity with the concomitant emergence of an anomalous Hall effect at P=1.15 GPa. Remarkably, upon further increasing the pressure above 1.6 GPa, we uncover a reentrant superconducting state that emerges out of a state still exhibiting an anomalous Hall effect. This superconducting state shows a marked increase in superconducting anisotropy with respect to the phase observed at ambient pressure, suggesting a different superconducting state with a distinct pairing symmetry. Via first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the system concomitantly transitions into a strong topological phase with markedly different band orbital characters and Fermi surfaces contributing to the superconductivity. These findings position 1T'-WS2 as a unique, tunable superconductor, wherein superconductivity, anomalous transport, and band features can be tuned through the application of moderate pressures.

Title: The coupling of polarization and oxygen vacancy migration in ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films enables electrically controlled thermal memories above room temperature
Authors: Didac Barneo, Rafael Ramos, Hugo Romero, Victor Leboran, Noa Varela-Dominguez, Jose A. Pardo, Francisco Rivadulla, Eric Langenberg
Abstract: Here we investigate epitaxial Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 ferroelectric thin films as potential candidates to be used as non-volatile electric-field-modulated thermal memories. The electric-field dependence of the thermal conductivity of metal/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/YSZ devices is found to be hysteretic, resembling the polarization vs electric field hysteresis loops, being maximum (minimum) at large applied positive (negative) voltages from the top metallic electrode. This dynamic thermal response is compatible with the coupling between the ferroelectric polarization and the oxygen ion migration, in which the oxygen vacancies are the main phonon scattering sources and the polarization acts as an electrically active ion migration barrier that creates the hysteresis. This new mechanism enables two non-volatile thermal states: high (ON) and low (OFF) thermal conductivity, with an ON/OFF ratio of 1.6. Both the ON and OFF states exhibit high stability over time, though the switching speed is limited by ion mobility in the YSZ electrode.

Title: Theory of Magnon Purcell Effect in Cavity Magnonic System
Authors: G. Zhao, Y. Wang, X.-F. Qian
Abstract: We conduct a systematic analysis of cavity effects on the decay dynamics of an open magnonic system. The Purcell effect on the magnon oscillator decay is thoroughly examined for both driven and non-driven scenarios. Analytical conditions are determined to distinguish between strong and weak coupling regimes, corresponding to oscillatory and pure decay behaviors respectively. Additionally, our theory also predicts the decay of the photon mode within the cavity-magnonic open system, demonstrating excellent agreement with existing experimental data. Our findings and methodologies can provide valuable insights for advancing research in cavity magnonic quantum control, quantum information processing, and the development of magnonic quantum devices.

Title: Non-Abelian interlayer coherent fractional quantum Hall states
Authors: Xiang-Jian Hou, Lei Wang, Ying-Hai Wu
Abstract: We study non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall state in double layer systems at total filling factor $1/2$. Recent progresses in two-dimensional van der Waals materials made it possible to explore the regime with very small interlayer distance. Numerical calculations suggests interlayer phase coherence can develop between the layers such that the electrons may redistribute between them without changing the Hall response. It corresponds to spontaneous breaking of the U(1) symmetry associated with the particle number difference in the layers. This state manifests itself as superfluid in counterflow measurement and has characteristic Hall response when current is passed through one layer and voltages in both layers are measured. As the interlayer distance increases, a phase transition into the Halperin 331 state occurs. We also discuss similar physics for bosonic systems with specially designed interactions.

Title: Bias voltage controlled inversions of tunneling magnetoresistance in van der Waals heterostructures Fe3GaTe2/hBN/Fe3GaTe2
Authors: Lihao Zhang, Miao He, Xiaoyu Wang, Haodong Zhang, Keying Han, Yonglai Liu, Lei Zhang, Yingchun Cheng, Jie Pan, Zhe Qu, Zhe Wang
Abstract: We report the bias voltage controlled inversions of tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in magnetic tunnel junctions composed of Fe3GaTe2 electrodes and hBN tunneling barrier, observed at room temperature. The polarity reversal of TMR occurs consistently at around 0.625 V across multiple devices and temperatures, highlighting the robustness of the effect. To understand this behavior, we developed a theoretical model incorporating spin-resolved density of states (DOS) at high energy levels. By adjusting the DOS weighting at different k points to account for misalignment between the crystal structure of electrodes in experimental devices, we improved agreement between experimental and theoretical inversion voltages. Our results provide valuable insight into the voltage-controlled spin injection and detection in two-dimensional magnetic tunnel junctions, with implications for the development of energy-efficient spintronic devices.

Title: Quantum Avalanches in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-preserving Interacting Ising Majorana Chain
Authors: Lv Zhang, Kai Xu, Heng Fan
Abstract: Recent numerical works have revealed the instability of many-body localized (MBL) phase in disordered quantum many-body systems with finite system sizes and over finite timescales. This instability arises from Griffith regions that occur at the thermodynamic limit, which rapidly thermalize and affect the surrounding typical MBL regions, introducing an avalanche mechanism into the system. Here, we consider the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-preserving interacting Ising Majorana chain model, which exhibits a more complex phase diagram, where an ergodic phase emerges between two MBL phases with different long-range order properties. We calculate the dynamic characteristics of the model when coupled to an infinite bath under perturbation, and through scaling behavior of the slowest thermalization rate, we find how critical disorder strengths in finite-size systems are affected by the avalanche mechanism. We also employe the embedded inclusion model and use the time evolution of mutual information between each spin and the artificial Griffith region to probe the diffusion of the thermal bubble. We observe that in finite-sized systems, the critical disorder strength gradually drifts away from the central. Our work demonstrate that both MBL paramagnetic phase and MBL spin-glass phase are unstable at finite sizes.

Title: Discontinuous Transition to Active Nematic Turbulence
Authors: Malcolm Hillebrand, Ricard Alert
Abstract: Active fluids exhibit chaotic flows at low Reynolds number known as active turbulence. Whereas the statistical properties of the chaotic flows are increasingly well understood, the nature of the transition from laminar to turbulent flows as activity increases remains unclear. Here, through simulations of a minimal model of unbounded active nematics, we find that the transition to active turbulence is discontinuous. We show that the transition features a jump in the mean-squared velocity, as well as bistability and hysteresis between laminar and chaotic flows. From distributions of finite-time Lyapunov exponents, we identify the transition at a value $A^*\approx 4900$ of the dimensionless activity number. Below the transition to chaos, we find subcritical bifurcations that feature bistability of different laminar patterns. These bifurcations give rise to oscillations and to chaotic transients, which become very long close to the transition to turbulence. Overall, our findings contrast with the continuous transition to turbulence in channel confinement, where turbulent puffs emerge within a laminar background. We propose that, without confinement, the long-range hydrodynamic interactions of Stokes flow suppress the spatial coexistence of different flow states, and thus render the transition discontinuous.

Title: Inferring High-Order Couplings with Neural Networks
Authors: Aurélien Decelle, Alfonso de Jesús Navas Gómez, Beatriz Seoane
Abstract: Maximum-entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical mechanics, have become indispensable tools for modeling pairwise interactions in disciplines such as bioinformatics, ecology, and neuroscience. Despite their remarkable success, these methods often overlook high-order interactions that may be crucial in complex systems. Conversely, while modern machine learning approaches can capture such interactions, existing interpretable frameworks are computationally expensive, making it impractical to assess the relevance of high-order interactions in real-world scenarios. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) offer a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations via hidden nodes in a bipartite neural network. Here, we present a method that maps RBMs exactly onto generalized Potts models with interactions of arbitrary high order. This approach leverages large-$N$ approximations, facilitated by the simple architecture of the RBM, to enable the efficient extraction of effective many-body couplings with minimal computational cost. This mapping also enables the development of a general formal framework for the extraction of effective higher-order interactions in arbitrarily complex probabilistic models. Additionally, we introduce a robust formalism for gauge fixing within the generalized Potts model. We validate our method by accurately recovering two- and three-body interactions from synthetic datasets. Additionally, applying our framework to protein sequence data demonstrates its effectiveness in reconstructing protein contact maps, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results position RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for investigating high-order interactions in complex systems.

Title: Multi-Phase Dataset for Ti and Ti-6Al-4V
Authors: Connor S. Allen, Albert P. Bartók
Abstract: Titanium and its alloys are technologically important materials that display a rich phase behaviour. In order to enable large-scale, realistic modelling of Ti and its alloys on the atomistic scale, Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are crucial, but rely on databases of atomic configurations. We report databases of such configurations that represent the {\alpha}, \b{eta}, {\omega} and liquid phases of Ti and the Ti-6Al-4V alloy, where we provide total energy, force and stress values evaluated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) using the PBE exchange-correlation functional. We have also leveraged and extended a data reduction strategy, via non-diagonal supercells, for the vibrational properties of Ti and sampling of atomic species within bulk crystalline data for Ti-6Al-4V. These configurations may be used to fit MLIP models that can accurately model the phase behaviour of Ti and Ti-6Al-4V across a broad range of thermodynamic conditions. To validate models, we assembled a set of benchmark protocols, which can be used to rapidly develop and evaluate MLIP models. We demonstrated the utility of our databases and validation tools by fitting models based on the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) and Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) frameworks.

Title: Vortex stability in interacting Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Ajay Srinivasan, Aaron Wirthwein, Stephan Haas
Abstract: We study the stability of vortices in a binary system of Bose-Einstein condensates, with their wave functions modeled by a set of coupled, time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Beginning with an effective two-dimensional system, we identify miscible and immiscible regimes characterized by the inter- and intra-atomic interactions and the initial configuration of the system. We then consider a binary system of Bose-Einstein condensates placed in a rotating harmonic trap and study the single vortex state in this system. We derive an approximate form for the energy of a single vortex in the binary system and the critical angular velocity for the global stability of a vortex at the center of the trap. We also compute the metastability onset angular velocity for the local stability of a vortex at the center of the trap. Numerical solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equations support these expressions. These rotational results inform us of a novel subphase within the miscible regime of the binary condensate system. We thus demonstrate the non-trivial aspects of vortex stability in interacting binary Bose-Einstein condensates as a result of their non-linear interactions.

Title: A strong-coupling effective-field theory for asymmetrically charged plates with counterions only
Authors: L. Samaj, E. Trizac, M. Trulsson
Abstract: We are interested in rationalizing the phenomenon of like-charge attraction between charged bodies, such as a pair of colloids, in the strong coupling regime. The two colloids are modelled as uniformly charged parallel plates, neutralized by mobile counterions. In an earlier work [Palaia et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 126, 3143 (2022)], we developed an effective-field theory for symmetric plates, stemming from the ground-state description that holds at infinite couplings. Here, we generalize the approach to the asymmetric case, where the plates bear charges of the same sign, but of different values. In the symmetric situation, the mobile ions, which are localized in the vicinity of the two plates, share equally between both of them. Here, the sharing is non-trivial, depending both on the coupling parameter and the distance between the plates. We thus introduce a counterion occupation parameter, that is determined variationally to ensure minimum of the free energy. The resulting analytical results for the pressure as a function of the plate-plate distance $d$ agree well with our Monte Carlo data, in a large interval of strong and intermediate coupling constants $\Xi$. We show in particular that within this description, there exists a range of large distances at which the attractive pressure features a $1/d^2$ behavior.

Title: Spin polarised quantised transport via one-dimensional nanowire-graphene contacts
Authors: Daniel Burrow, Jesus C. Toscano-Figueroa, Victor H. Guarochico-Moreira, Khalid Omari, Irina V. Grigorieva, Thomas Thomson, Ivan J. Vera-Marun
Abstract: Graphene spintronics offers a promising route to achieve low power 2D electronics for next generation classical and quantum computation. As device length scales are reduced to the limit of the electron mean free path, the transport mechanism crosses over to the ballistic regime. However, ballistic transport has yet to be shown in a graphene spintronic device, a necessary step towards realising ballistic spintronics. Here, we report ballistic injection of spin polarised carriers via one-dimensional contacts between magnetic nanowires and a high mobility graphene channel. The nanowire-graphene interface defines an effective constriction that confines charge carriers over a length scale smaller than that of their mean free path. This is evidenced by the observation of quantised conductance through the contacts with no applied magnetic field and a transition into the quantum Hall regime with increasing field strength. These effects occur in the absence of any constriction in the graphene itself and occur across several devices with transmission probability in the range T = 0.08 - 0.30.

Title: Exploring Metastability in Ising models: critical droplets, energy barriers and exit time
Authors: Vanessa Jacquier
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the research on the metastable behavior of the Ising model. We analyze the transition times from the set of metastable states to the set of the stable states by identifying the critical configurations that the system crosses with high probability during this transition and by computing the energy barrier that the system must overcome to reach the stable state starting from the metastable one. We describe the dynamical phase transition of the Ising model evolving under Glauber dynamics across various contexts, including different lattices, dimensions and anisotropic variants. The analysis is extended to related models, such as long-range Ising model, Blume-Capel and Potts models, as well as to dynamics like Kawasaki dynamics, providing insights into metastability across different systems.

Title: Machine Learning Force-Field Approach for Itinerant Electron Magnets
Authors: Sheng Zhang, Yunhao Fan, Kotaro Shimizu, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: We review the recent development of machine-learning (ML) force-field frameworks for Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) dynamics simulations of itinerant electron magnets, focusing on the general theory and implementations of symmetry-invariant representations of spin configurations. The crucial properties that such magnetic descriptors must satisfy are differentiability with respect to spin rotations and invariance to both lattice point-group symmetry and internal spin rotation symmetry. We propose an efficient implementation based on the concept of reference irreducible representations, modified from the group-theoretical power-spectrum and bispectrum methods. The ML framework is demonstrated using the s-d models, which are widely applied in spintronics research. We show that LLG simulations based on local fields predicted by the trained ML models successfully reproduce representative non-collinear spin structures, including 120$^\circ$, tetrahedral, and skyrmion crystal orders of the triangular-lattice s-d models. Large-scale thermal quench simulations enabled by ML models further reveal intriguing freezing dynamics and glassy stripe states consisting of skyrmions and bi-merons. Our work highlights the utility of ML force-field approach to dynamical modeling of complex spin orders in itinerant electron magnets.

Title: Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Takato Yoshimura, Lucas Sá
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum statistical mechanics of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In contrast, the quantum theory of many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. We relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum RP resonances converge inside the unit disk. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions. Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We identify the exact RP resonances in the RPM and prove that the same RP resonances are obtained from operator truncation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance. Finally, we demonstrate how conservation laws, many-body localization, and nonlocal interactions merge the leading RP resonance into the unit circle, thereby suppressing anomalous relaxation.

Title: Neural Architecture Codesign for Fast Physics Applications
Authors: Jason Weitz, Dmitri Demler, Luke McDermott, Nhan Tran, Javier Duarte
Abstract: We develop a pipeline to streamline neural architecture codesign for physics applications to reduce the need for ML expertise when designing models for novel tasks. Our method employs neural architecture search and network compression in a two-stage approach to discover hardware efficient models. This approach consists of a global search stage that explores a wide range of architectures while considering hardware constraints, followed by a local search stage that fine-tunes and compresses the most promising candidates. We exceed performance on various tasks and show further speedup through model compression techniques such as quantization-aware-training and neural network pruning. We synthesize the optimal models to high level synthesis code for FPGA deployment with the hls4ml library. Additionally, our hierarchical search space provides greater flexibility in optimization, which can easily extend to other tasks and domains. We demonstrate this with two case studies: Bragg peak finding in materials science and jet classification in high energy physics, achieving models with improved accuracy, smaller latencies, or reduced resource utilization relative to the baseline models.

Abstract: Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSXS) is a powerful technique for probing both spatial and electronic structures within solid-state this http URL present a newly developed RSXS capability at beamline 13-3 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), designed to enhance materials science research. This advanced setup achieves a base sample temperature as low as 9.8 K combined with extensive angular motions (azimuthal \phi and flipping \chi), enables comprehensive exploration of reciprocal space. Two types of detectors, an Au/GaAsP Schottky photodiode and a CCD detector with over 95% quantum efficiency, are integrated to effectively capture scattered photons. Extensive testing has confirmed the enhanced functionality of this RSXS setup, including its temperature and angular performance. The versatility and effectiveness of the system have been demonstrated through studies of various materials, including superlattice heterostructures and high-temperature superconductors.

Title: Emergent weight morphologies in deep neural networks
Authors: Pascal de Jong, Felix Meigel, Steffen Rulands
Abstract: Whether deep neural networks can exhibit emergent behaviour is not only relevant for understanding how deep learning works, it is also pivotal for estimating potential security risks of increasingly capable artificial intelligence systems. Here, we show that training deep neural networks gives rise to emergent weight morphologies independent of the training data. Specifically, in analogy to condensed matter physics, we derive a theory that predict that the homogeneous state of deep neural networks is unstable in a way that leads to the emergence of periodic channel structures. We verified these structures by performing numerical experiments on a variety of data sets. Our work demonstrates emergence in the training of deep neural networks, which impacts the achievable performance of deep neural networks.

Title: Chemistry in a cryogenic buffer gas cell
Authors: Qi Sun, Jinyu Dai, Rian Koots, Benjamin Riley, Jesús Pérez-Ríos, Debayan Mitra, Tanya Zelevinsky
Abstract: Cryogenic buffer gas sources are ubiquitous for producing cold, collimated molecular beams for quantum science, chemistry, and precision measurements. The molecules are typically produced by laser ablating a metal target in the presence of a donor gas, where the radical of interest emerges among the reaction products due to a barrier-free process or under thermal or optical excitation. High-barrier reactions, such as between calcium and molecular hydrogen, should be precluded. Here, we study chemical reactions between Ca and three hydrogen isotopologues H$_2$, D$_2$, and HD in a cryogenic cell with helium buffer gas. Remarkably, we observe that H$_2$ can serve as both a reactant and a buffer gas, far outperforming D$_2$ and HD. Our results demonstrate a robust method for generating cold beams of alkaline-earth-metal hydrides for laser cooling and trapping. The observations are complemented by a reaction model, yielding qualitative agreement with the experiment.

Title: Large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories: A pedagogical overview
Authors: Leonardo Santilli
Abstract: The different large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories in three, four, and five dimensions are reviewed. We distinguish between the planar limit of SQCD theories, the M-theory limit suited in three and five dimensions, and the long quiver limit. The method to solve exactly the sphere partition functions in each type of limit is spelled out in a pedagogical way. After a comprehensive general treatment of the saddle point approximation in the large $N$ limit, we present an extensive list of examples and detail the calculations. The scope of this overview is to provide an entry-level, computation-oriented understanding of the techniques featured in the field theory side of the AdS/CFT correspondence.

Title: Witnessing non-stationary and non-Markovian environments with a quantum sensor
Authors: John W. Rosenberg, Martín Kuffer, Inbar Zohar, Rainer Stöhr, Andrej Denisenko, Analia Zwick, Gonzalo A. Álvarez, Amit Finkler
Abstract: Quantum sensors offer exceptional sensitivity to nanoscale magnetic field fluctuations, where non-stationary effects such as spin diffusion and non-Markovian dynamics arising from coupling to few environmental degrees of freedom play critical roles. Here, we demonstrate how quantum sensors can characterize the statistical properties of noise sources, distinguishing between stationary and non-stationary behaviors, as well as Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a platform, we develop a physical noise model that analytically predicts Ramsey decay curves under different noise regimes. These predictions are experimentally validated by measuring Ramsey decay for NV centers subject to injected noise of each type. Our results showcase the capability of quantum sensors to unravel complex noise behaviors induced by nanoscale environments, shedding light on their physical origins and guiding the development of strategies to mitigate decoherence. This work deepens our understanding of noise dynamics at the nanoscale and lays the foundation for enhancing the performance and robustness of quantum technologies.

Title: Hierarchical Serpentine-like Organic Crystal Optical Waveguides for Artificial Neural Networks
Authors: Avulu Vinod Kumar, Mehdi Rohullah, Melchi Chosenyah, Sinduja Gaddam, Rajadurai Chandrasekar
Abstract: Optical components and circuits that deal with multiple signal generation and processing are quintessential for artificial neural networks. Herein, we present a proof-of-concept four-layered organic optical artificial neural network (ANN)-like architecture, constructed from flexible organic crystals of (E)-1-(((5-methylpyridin-2-yl)imino)methyl)naphthalene-2-ol (MPyIN), employing an atomic force microscopy cantilever tip-based mechanical micromanipulation technique. Initially, the strategic selection of four MPyIN crystal active waveguides of varying lengths, mechanically bending them into serpentine-like forms, followed by their hierarchical integration, creates neuron-like, four-layered interconnected optical waveguides with six optical synapses. The synapses in the ANN-like architecture enable parallel transmissions of passive optical signals via evanescent coupling across multiple paths through various layers of the serpentine-shaped optical waveguides. Notably, the feedforward mechanism allows the synapses to multiply and split the optical signal generated at any input into four diverging signals with varying magnitudes. Here, certain outputs deliver a mixed signal (passive and active) due to diverging and converging optical transmission paths. This hierarchical, ANN-like tiny architecture paves the way for the development of smart optical neural networks utilizing multiple emissive and phase-changing organic crystals.

Title: Biorealistic response in a technology-compatible graphene synaptic transistor
Authors: Anastasia Chouprik, Elizaveta Guberna, Islam Mutaev, Ilya Margolin, Evgeny Guberna, Maxim Rybin
Abstract: Artificial synapse is a key element of future brain-inspired neuromorphic computing systems implemented in hardware. This work presents a graphene synaptic transistor based on all-technology-compatible materials that exhibits highly tunable biorealistic behavior. It is shown that the device geometry and interface properties can be designed to maximize the memory window and minimize power consumption. The device exhibits a virtually continuous range of multiple conductance levels, similar to synaptic weighting, which is achieved by gradual injection/emission of electrons into the floating gate and interface traps under the influence of an external electric field. Similar to the biological synapse, the transistor has short-term intrinsic dynamics that affect the long-term state. The temporal injection/emission dynamics of an electronic synapse closely resemble those of its biological counterpart and is exploited to emulate biorealistic behavior using a number of synaptic functions, including paired-pulse facilitation/depression, spike-rate-dependent plasticity, and others. Such a synaptic transistor can serve as a building block in hardware artificial networks for advanced information processing and storage.

Title: Measurement and Teleportation in the cSYK/JT Correspondence
Authors: Raphael Brinster, Stefan Forste, Yannic Kruse, Saurabh Natu
Abstract: We consider two complex SYK models entangled in a thermofield double (TFD) state and investigate the effect of one-sided projective measurements. As measurement operator we choose single site charge operators. Performing a measurement results in a non-zero $U(1)$ charge. The entropy curve differs from the previously studied SYK model due to a thermodynamic phase transition that takes place after a certain charge is reached. We also match our results to a dual bulk description. Finally, a teleportation protocol is provided to support the notion of a traversable wormhole being formed.

Title: SimOS: A Python Framework for Simulations of Optically Addressable Spins
Authors: Laura A. Völker, John M. Abendroth, Christian L. Degen, Konstantin Herb
Abstract: We present an open-source simulation framework for optically detected magnetic resonance, developed in Python. The framework allows users to construct, manipulate, and evolve multipartite quantum systems that consist of spins and electronic levels. We provide an interface for efficient time-evolution in Lindblad form as well as a framework for facilitating simulation of spatial and generalized stochastic dynamics. Further, symbolic operator construction and propagation is supported for simple model systems making the framework also ideal for use in classroom instruction of magnetic resonance. Designed to be backend-agnostic, the library leverages existing Python libraries as computational backends. We introduce the most important functionality and illustrate the syntax on a series of examples. These include systems such as the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond and photo-generated spin-correlated radical pairs for which our library offers system-specific sub-modules.

Title: Entanglement transition in a cluster spin chain coupled with free spins
Authors: Kevissen Sellapillay, Laurent Raymond, Alberto D. Verga
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement of a ladder of spins formed by two sublattices, a ''cluster'' chain and the ''environment'', consisting of independent spins, both coupled by an exchange interaction and evolving under a unitary discrete time dynamics. The automaton is defined by the composition of the two body spin swap gate (between sublattices) and the three body cluster interaction. We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.

Bawendi, Douglas Natelson, Philippe Tamarat, Brahim Lounis, Jacky Even, Aditya D. Mohite
Abstract: Colloidal perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are an exciting platform for on-demand quantum, and classical optoelectronic and photonic devices. However, their potential success is limited by the extreme sensitivity and low stability arising from their weak intrinsic lattice bond energy and complex surface chemistry. Here we report a novel platform of buried perovskite quantum dots (b-PQDs) in a three-dimensional perovskite thin-film, fabricated using one-step, flash annealing, which overcomes surface related instabilities in colloidal perovskite dots. The b-PQDs demonstrate ultrabright and stable single-dot emission, with resolution-limited linewidths below 130 {\mu}eV, photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.1), no blinking, suppressed spectral diffusion, and high photon count rates of 10^4/s, consistent with unity quantum yield. The ultrasharp linewidth resolves exciton fine-structures (dark and triplet excitons) and their dynamics under a magnetic field. Additionally, b-PQDs can be electrically driven to emit single photons with 1 meV linewidth and photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.4). These results pave the way for on-chip, low-cost single-photon sources for next generation quantum optical communication and sensing.

Title: Autonomous scanning probe microscopy with hypothesis learning: Exploring the physics of domain switching in ferroelectric materials
Authors: Yongtao Liu, Anna Morozovska, Eugene Eliseev, Kyle P. Kelley, Rama Vasudevan, Maxim Ziatdinov, Sergei V. Kalinin
Abstract: We report the development and implementation of a hypothesis learning based automated experiment, in which the microscope operating in the autonomous mode identifies the physical laws behind the material's response. Specifically, we explore the bias induced transformations that underpin the functionality of broad classes of devices and functional materials from batteries and memristors to ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics. Optimization and design of these materials require probing the mechanisms of these transformations on the nanometer scale as a function of the broad range of control parameters such as applied potential and time, often leading to experimentally intractable scenarios. At the same time, often the behaviors of these systems are understood within potentially competing theoretical models, or hypotheses. Here, we develop a hypothesis list that covers the possible limiting scenarios for the domain growth, including thermodynamic, domain wall pinning, and screening limited. We further develop and experimentally implement the hypothesis driven automated experiment in Piezoresponse Force Microscopy, autonomously identifying the mechanisms of the bias induced domain switching. This approach can be applied for a broad range of physical and chemical experiments with relatively low dimensional control parameter space and for which the possible competing models of the system behavior that ideally cover the full range of physical eventualities are known or can be created. These include other scanning probe microscopy modalities such as force distance curve measurements and nanoindentation, as well as materials synthesis and optimization.

Title: Generalized Zurek's bound on the cost of an individual classical or quantum computation
Authors: Artemy Kolchinsky
Abstract: We consider the minimal thermodynamic cost of an individual computation, where a single input $x$ is mapped to a single output $y$. In prior work, Zurek proposed that this cost was given by $K(x\vert y)$, the conditional Kolmogorov complexity of $x$ given $y$ (up to an additive constant which does not depend on $x$ or $y$). However, this result was derived from an informal argument, applied only to deterministic computations, and had an arbitrary dependence on the choice of protocol (via the additive constant). Here we use stochastic thermodynamics to derive a generalized version of Zurek's bound from a rigorous Hamiltonian formulation. Our bound applies to all quantum and classical processes, whether noisy or deterministic, and it explicitly captures the dependence on the protocol. We show that $K(x\vert y)$ is a minimal cost of mapping $x$ to $y$ that must be paid using some combination of heat, noise, and protocol complexity, implying a tradeoff between these three resources. Our result is a kind of "algorithmic fluctuation theorem" with implications for the relationship between the Second Law and the Physical Church-Turing thesis.

Title: Informational active matter
Authors: Bryan VanSaders, Michel Fruchart, Vincenzo Vitelli
Abstract: Many biological and synthetic systems out of equilibrium can be viewed as ratchets that rectify environmental noise through measurements and information processing, like in Maxwell's prototypical demon. These systems pose a challenge to standard approaches because they are better described in terms of decision-making protocols similar to computer programs rather than force laws. Here, we study a many-body generalization of the Maxwell demon problem: a fluid composed of adaptive particles that achieve collective behavior by biasing noise-driven scattering events. Using a combination of information-theoretic, kinetic, and hydrodynamic tools, we elucidate how microscopic decision-making protocols, rather than microscopic forces, generate upon coarse-graining macroscopic non-equilibrium states such as flocking. We find that the signature of such microscopic choices is an 'informational activity' that selectively compresses phase space and causes departures from equilibrium scaling with the magnitude of environmental noise. We envision applications to noise-induced patterning performed by collections of microrobots or programmable phoretic colloids that exploit, rather than fight, fluctuating fields.

Title: Curvature-induced valley-dependent spin-orbit interaction
Authors: A. Yamakage, T. Sato, R. Okuyama, T. Funato, W. Izumida, K. Sato, T. Kato, M. Matsuo
Abstract: We construct a general theoretical framework for describing curvature-induced spin-orbit interactions on the basis of group theory. Our theory can systematically determine the emergence of spin splitting in the band structure according to symmetry in the wavenumber space and the bending direction of the material. As illustrative examples, we derive the curvature-induced spin-orbit coupling for carbon and silicon nanotubes. Our theory offers a strategy for designing valley-contrasting spin-orbit coupled materials by tuning their curvatures.

Title: Effect of shape anisotropy on percolation of aligned and overlapping objects on lattices
Authors: Jasna C. K., V. Sasidevan
Abstract: We investigate the percolation transition of aligned, overlapping, anisotropic shapes on lattices. Using the recently proposed lattice version of excluded volume theory, we show that shape-anisotropy leads to some intriguing consequences regarding the percolation behavior of anisotropic shapes. We consider a prototypical anisotropic shape - rectangle - on a square lattice and show that for rectangles of width unity (sticks), the percolation threshold is a monotonically decreasing function of the stick length, whereas, for rectangles of width greater than two, it is a monotonically increasing function. Interestingly, for rectangles of width two, the percolation threshold is independent of its length. We show that this independence of threshold on the length of a side holds for d-dimensional hypercubiods as well for specific integer values for the lengths of the remaining sides. The limiting case of the length of the rectangles going to infinity shows that the limiting threshold value is finite and depends upon the width of the rectangle. This 'continuum' limit with the lattice spacing tending to zero only along a subset of the possible directions in d-dimensions results in a novel 'semi-continuum' percolation system. We show that similar results hold for other anisotropic shapes and lattices in different dimensions. The critical properties of the aligned and overlapping rectangles are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the threshold values given by the lattice-excluded volume theory are in good agreement with the simulation results, especially for larger rectangles. Our results show that shape-anisotropy of the aligned, overlapping percolating units has a marked influence on the percolation properties, especially when a subset of the dimensions of the percolation units are made to diverge.

Title: Dynamical quantum phase transitions following a noisy quench
Authors: R. Jafari, A. Langari, S. Eggert, Henrik Johannesson
Abstract: We study how time-dependent energy fluctuations impact the dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) following a noisy ramped quench of the transverse magnetic field in a quantum Ising chain. By numerically solving the stochastic Schrödinger equation of the mode-decoupled fermionic Hamiltonian of the problem, we identify two generic scenarios: Depending on the amplitude of the noise and the rate of the ramp, the expected periodic sequence of noiseless DQPTs may either be uniformly shifted in time or else replaced by a disarray of closely spaced DQPTs. Guided by an exact noise master equation, we trace the phenomenon to the interplay between noise-induced excitations which accumulate during the quench and the near-adiabatic dynamics of the massive modes of the system. Our analysis generalizes to any 1D fermionic two-band model subject to a noisy quench.

Title: Enhancement of stability of metastable states in the presence of L\'{e}vy noise
Authors: A. A. Dubkov, C. Guarcello, B. Spagnolo
Abstract: The barrier-crossing event for superdiffusion characterized by symmetric Lévy flights is analyzed. Starting from the fractional Fokker-Planck equation, we derive an integro-differential equation along with the necessary conditions to calculate the mean residence time of a particle within a fixed interval. We consider an arbitrary smooth potential profile, particularly metastable, with a sink and Lévy noise characterized by both an arbitrary index $\alpha$ and arbitrary noise intensity parameter. For the specific case of Lévy flights with an index $\alpha = 1$ and a cubic metastable potential, a closed expression for the mean residence time is obtained in quadratures. The analytical results reveal an enhancement of the mean residence time in the metastable state due to the influence of Lévy noise.

Title: Microscopic Legendre Transform, Canonical Ensemble and Jaynes' Maximum Entropy Principle
Authors: Ramandeep S. Johal
Abstract: Legendre transform between thermodynamic quantities such as the Helmholtz free energy and entropy plays a key role in the formulation of the canonical ensemble. In the standard treatment, the transform exchanges the independent variable from the system's internal energy to its conjugate variable -- the inverse temperature of the heat reservoir. In this article, we formulate a microscopic version of the transform between the free energy and Shannon entropy of the system, where the conjugate variables are the microstate probabilities and the energies (scaled by the inverse temperature). The present approach gives a non-conventional perspective on the connection between information-theoretic measure of entropy and thermodynamic entropy. We focus on the exact differential property of Shannon entropy, utilizing it to derive central relations within the canonical ensemble. Thermodynamics of a system in contact with the heat reservoir is discussed in this framework. Other approaches, in particular, Jaynes' maximum entropy principle is compared with the present approach.

Title: Fluctuation-Induced First Order Transition to Collective Motion
Authors: David Martin, Gianmarco Spera, Hugues Chaté, Charlie Duclut, Cesare Nardini, Julien Tailleur, Frédéric van Wijland
Abstract: The nature of the transition to collective motion in assemblies of aligning self-propelled particles remains a long-standing matter of debate. In this article, we focus on dry active matter and show that weak fluctuations suffice to generically turn second-order mean-field transitions into a `discontinuous' coexistence scenario. Our theory shows how fluctuations induce a density-dependence of the polar-field mass, even when this effect is absent at mean-field level. In turn, this dependency on density triggers a feedback loop between ordering and advection that ultimately leads to an inhomogeneous transition to collective motion and the emergence of inhomogeneous travelling bands. Importantly, we show that such a fluctuation-induced first order transition is present in both metric models, in which particles align with neighbors within a finite distance, and in `topological' ones, in which alignment is based on more complex constructions of neighbor sets. We compute analytically the noise-induced renormalization of the polar-field mass using stochastic calculus, which we further back up by a one-loop field-theoretical analysis. Finally, we confirm our analytical predictions by numerical simulations of fluctuating hydrodynamics as well as of topological particle models with either k-nearest neighbors or Voronoi alignment.

Title: On the optimal relaxation rate for the Metropolis algorithm in one dimension
Authors: A. Patrón, A. D. Chepelianskii, A. Prados, E. Trizac
Abstract: We study the relaxation of the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm corresponding to a single particle trapped in a one-dimensional confining potential, with even jump distributions that ensure that the dynamics verifies detailed balance. Previous work suggested that, for smooth jump distributions, the fastest relaxation rate is obtained as a result of the competition between diffusive and rejection-dominated dynamics. In this work, we show that a new regime comes into play for two-peaked jump distributions, where the relaxation dynamics is neither dominated by diffusion nor rejection: the eigenmodes adopt an oscillatory form, reminiscent of charge density waves (CDW) -- thus we term this new regime the CDW regime. Using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques, the parameter regions corresponding to diffusion, rejection, and CDW are characterised, as well as the transition lines between them -- i.e. a phase diagram is built. The optimal relaxation rate is located at the triple point of phase coexistence, where the transition lines (diffusive-rejection, diffusive-CDW, and CDW-rejection) intersect. Our theoretical framework is checked versus the numerical diagonalisation of the master equation. We also briefly discuss more sophisticated attempts at optimising the relaxation rate to equilibrium.

Title: A Dean-Kawasaki equation for reaction diffusion systems driven by Poisson noise
Authors: Richard E. Spinney, Richard G. Morris
Abstract: We derive a stochastic partial differential equation that describes the fluctuating behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems of N particles, undergoing Markovian, unary reactions. This generalises the work of Dean [J. Phys. A: Math. and Gen., 29 (24), L613, (1996)] through the inclusion of random Poisson fields. Our approach is based on weak interactions, which has the dual benefit that the resulting equations asymptotically converge (in the N to infinity limit) on a variation of a McKean- Vlasov diffusion, whilst still being related to the case of Dean-like strong interactions via a trivial rescaling. Various examples are presented, alongside a discussion of possible extensions to more complicated reaction schemes.

Title: Interaction-induced nonlinear magnon transport in noncentrosymmetric magnets
Authors: Kosuke Fujiwara, Takahiro Morimoto
Abstract: We study the effect of the magnon-magnon interaction on the nonlinear magnon transport. The magnonmagnon interaction induces nonreciprocal magnon decay when the time-reversal symmetry is broken and leads to nonlinear thermal responses of magnons. We construct a theoretical framework to study the nonlinear thermal responses due to the nonreciprocal magnon decay by using the imaginary Dyson equation and quantum kinetic theory, which is then applied to models of one-dimensional (1D) antiferromagnets and 2D honeycomb ferromagnets with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. An order estimate shows that the nonlinear thermal response from the present mechanism is feasible for experimental measurement.

Title: Growth and Structure of alpha-Ta films for Quantum Circuit Integration
Authors: Loren D. Alegria, Alex Abelson, Eunjeong Kim, Soohyun Im, Paul M. Voyles, Vincenzo Lordi, Jonathan L Dubois, Yaniv J. Rosen
Abstract: Tantalum films incorporated into superconducting circuits have exhibited low surface losses, resulting in long-lived qubit states. Remaining loss pathways originate in microscopic defects which manifest as two level systems (TLS) at low temperature. These defects limit performance, so careful attention to tantalum film structures is critical for optimal use in quantum devices. In this work, we investigate the growth of tantalum using magnetron sputtering on sapphire, Si, and photoresist substrates. In the case of sapphire, we present procedures for growth of fully-oriented films with alpha-Ta [1 1 1] // Al2O3 [0 0 0 1] and alpha-Ta [1 -1 0] // Al2O3 [1 0 -1 0] orientational relationships, and having residual resistivity ratios (RRR) ~ 60 for 220 nm thick films. On Si, we find a complex grain texturing with Ta [1 1 0] normal to the substrate and RRR ~ 30. We further demonstrate airbridge fabrication using Nb to nucleate alpha-Ta on photoresist surfaces. For the films on sapphire, resonators show TLS-limited quality factors of 1.3 +/- 0.3 x 10^6 at 10 mK (for waveguide gap and conductor widths of 3 microns and 6 microns, respectively). Structural characterization using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, low temperature transport, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and transmission electron microscopy reveal the dependence of residual impurities and screw dislocation density on processing conditions. The results provide practical insights for fabrication of advanced superconducting devices including qubit arrays, and guide future work on crystallographically deterministic qubit fabrication.

Title: General solution for the response of materials under radiation and tilted magnetic field: semi-classical regime
Authors: Narjes Kheirabadi, YuanDong Wang
Abstract: The Berry curvature dipole is well-known to cause Hall conductivity. This study expands on previous results to demonstrate how two- and three-dimensional materials react under a tilted magnetic field in the linear and nonlinear regimes. We show how the Hall effect has a quantum origin by deriving the general form of intrinsic and extrinsic currents in materials under a tilted magnetic field. Our focus is on determining the linear and nonlinear response of two-dimensional materials. We also demonstrate that as the result of the perpendicular component of the magnetic field a current resulted by both velocity and Berry curvature can occur in two-dimensional materials and topological crystalline insulators in second harmonic generation and ratchet responses. The findings of this research may provide insight into the transport characteristics of materials in the semi-classical regime and initiate a new chapter in linear and nonlinear Hall effects.

Title: Gatemonium: A Voltage-Tunable Fluxonium
Authors: William M. Strickland, Bassel Heiba Elfeky, Lukas Baker, Andrea Maiani, Jaewoo Lee, Ido Levy, Jacob Issokson, Andrei Vrajitoarea, Javad Shabani
Abstract: We present a new style of fluxonium qubit, gatemonium, based on an all superconductorsemiconductor hybrid platform. The linear inductance is achieved using six hundred planar Al-InAs Josephson junctions (JJs) in series. By tuning the single junction with a gate voltage, we demonstrate electrostatic control of the effective Josephson energy, tuning the weight of the fictitious phase particle. One and two-tone spectroscopy of the gatemonium transitions further reveal details of the hybrid plasmon-fluxon spectrum. Accounting for the nonsinusoidal current-phase relation of the single junction, we fit the measured spectra to extract charging and inductive energies. We conduct time domain characterization of the plasmon modes in a second gatemonium device with different charging energy and JJ array inductance. We discuss future directions for this platform in gate voltage-tunable, high plasma frequency, enhanced impedance junction arrays, and enhanced coherence times for voltage tunable architectures.

Title: Testing Protocols for Obtaining Reliable PDFs from Laboratory x-ray Sources Using PDFgetX3
Authors: Till Schertenleib, Daniel Schmuckler, Yucong Chen, Geng Bang Jin, Wendy L. Queen, Simon J.L. Billinge
Abstract: In this work, we explored data acquisition protocols and improved data reduction protocols using PDFgetX3 to obtain reliable data for atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis from a laboratory-based Mo x-ray source. A variable counting scheme is described that preferentially counts in the high-angle region of the diffraction pattern. The effects on the resulting PDF are studied by varying the overall count time, the use of Soller slits, and limiting the out-of-plane divergence of the incident beam. The protocols are tested using an amorphous silica and a quartz sample. We also present a modification to the current PDFgetX3 data corrections to take care of sample absorption, which was previously neglected in the use of that program for high-energy synchrotron x-ray data. We show that, despite limitations in the Q-range and flux of laboratory instruments, reasonable data for PDF model fits may be obtained using the best protocols in a few hours of counting.

Title: Production and stabilization of a spin mixture of ultracold dipolar Bose gases
Authors: Maxime Lecomte, Alexandre Journeaux, Julie Veschambre, Jean Dalibard, Raphael Lopes
Abstract: Mixtures of ultracold gases with long-range interactions are expected to open new avenues in the study of quantum matter. Natural candidates for this research are spin mixtures of atomic species with large magnetic moments. However, the lifetime of such assemblies can be strongly affected by the dipolar relaxation that occurs in spin-flip collisions. Here we present experimental results for a mixture composed of the two lowest Zeeman states of $^{162}$Dy atoms, that act as dark states with respect to a light-induced quadratic Zeeman effect. We show that, due to an interference phenomenon, the rate for such inelastic processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the Wigner threshold law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths characterizing the s-wave interaction between these states, providing all necessary data to predict the miscibility range of the mixture, depending on its dimensionality.

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit unique properties and potential applications when reduced to one-dimensional (1D) nanoribbons (NRs), owing to quantum confinement and high edge densities. However, effective growth methods for self-aligned TMD NRs are still lacking. We demonstrate a versatile approach for lattice-guided growth of dense, aligned MoS2 NR arrays via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on anisotropic sapphire substrates, without tailored surface steps. This method enables the synthesis of NRs with widths below 10 nm and longitudinal axis parallel to the zigzag direction, being also extensible to the growth of WS2 NRs and MoS2-WS2 hetero-nanoribbons. Growth is influenced by both substrate and CVD temperature, indicating the role of anisotropic precursor diffusion and substrate interaction. The 1D nature of the NRs was asserted by the observation of Coulomb blockade at low temperature. Pronounced catalytic activity was observed at the edges of the NRs, indicating their promise for efficient catalysis.

Title: Subdiffusive transport in the Fredkin dynamical universality class
Authors: Catherine McCarthy, Hansveer Singh, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Romain Vasseur
Abstract: We identify a pseudolocal conserved charge in the Fredkin and Motzkin quantum spin chains and explore its consequences for the hydrodynamics of systems with Fredkin- or Motzkin-type kinetic constraints. We use this quantity to formulate an exact upper bound ${\cal O}(L^{-5/2})$ on the gap of the Fredkin and Motzkin spin chains. Our results establish that transport in kinetically constrained dynamical systems with Fredkin or Motzkin constraints is subdiffusive, with dynamical exponent $z \geq 5/2$.

Title: A BGK-type model for multi-component gas mixtures undergoing a bimolecular chemical reaction
Authors: Giorgio Martalò, Ana Jacinta Soares, Romina Travaglini
Abstract: We propose a new kinetic BGK-type model for a mixture of four monatomic gases, undergoing a bimolecular and reversible chemical reaction. The elastic and reactive interactions are described separately by distinct relaxation terms and the mechanical operator is the sum of binary BGK contributions, one for each pair of interacting species. In this way, our model separately incorporates the effects of mechanical processes and chemical reactions. Additionally, it retains the effects of inter-species interactions which are proper of the mixture. The dependence of Maxwellian attractors on the main macroscopic fields is explicitly expressed by assuming that the exchange rates for momentum and energy of mechanical and chemical operators coincide with the ones of the corresponding Boltzmann terms. Under suitable hypotheses, the relaxation of the distribution functions to equilibrium is shown through entropy dissipation. Some numerical simulations are included to investigate the trend to equilibrium.

Title: Anomalous diffusion in quantum system driven by heavy-tailed stochastic processes
Authors: Chenyue Guo, Yuchen Bi
Abstract: In this paper, we study a stochastically driven non-equilibrium quantum system where the driving protocols consist of hopping and waiting processes. The waiting times between two hopping processes satisfy a heavy-tailed distribution. By calculating the squared width of the wavepackets, our findings demonstrate the emergence of various anomalous transport phenomena when the system remains unchanged within the heavy-tailed regime, including superdiffusive, subdiffusive, and standard diffusive motion. Only subdiffusion occurs when the system has evolved during the waiting process. All these transport behaviors are accompanied by a breakdown of ergodicity, highlighting the complex dynamics induced by the stochastic driving mechanism.

Title: Local Order Controls the Onset of Oscillations in the Nonreciprocal Ising Model
Authors: Kristian Blom, Uwe Thiele, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: We elucidate the generic bifurcation behavior of local and global order in the nonreciprocal Ising model evolving under Glauber dynamics. We show that a critical magnitude of nearest-neighbor correlations within the respective lattices controls the emergence of coherent oscillations of global order as a result of frustration. Local order is maintained during these oscillations, implying nontrivial spatiotemporal correlations. Long-lived states emerge in the strong-interaction regime. The residence time in either of these states eventually diverges, giving rise to ordered non-equilibrium trapped states and a loss of ergodic behavior via a saddle-node-infinite-period bifurcation. Our work provides a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the nonreciprocal Ising model beyond the mean-field approximation.

Title: Percolation in semicontinuum geometries
Authors: Jasna C.K, V. Krishnadev, V. Sasidevan
Abstract: We study percolation problems of overlapping objects where the underlying geometry is such that in D-dimensions, a subset of the directions has a lattice structure, while the remaining directions have a continuum structure. The resulting semicontinuum problem describes the percolation of overlapping shapes in parallel layers or lanes with positional constraints for the placement of the objects along the discrete directions. Several semicontinuum percolation systems are analyzed like hypercuboids with a particular focus on 2D and 3D cases, disks, and parallelograms. Adapting the excluded volume arguments to the semicontinuum setting, we show that for the semicontinuum problem of hypercuboids, for fixed side-lengths of the hypercuboids along the directions in which a lattice structure is maintained, the percolation threshold is always independent of the side-lengths along the continuum directions. The result holds even when there is a distribution for the side-lengths along the continuum directions. Trends in the variation of the thresholds, as we vary the linear measure of the shapes along the continuum directions, are obtained for other semicontinuum models like disks and parallelograms in 2D. The results are compared with those of corresponding continuum and lattice models. For the 2D and 3D models considered, using Monte Carlo simulations, we verify the excluded volume predictions for the trends and numerical values of the percolation thresholds. Very good agreement is seen between the predicted numerical values and the simulation results. The semicontinuum setting also allows us to establish a connection between the percolation problem of overlapping shapes in 2D continuum and the triangular lattice. We also verify that the isotropy of the threshold for anisotropic shapes and standard percolation universality class is maintained in the semicontinuum setting.

Title: Magnetic topological Weyl fermions in half-metallic In$_2$CoSe$_4$
Authors: Xiaosong Bai, Yan Wang, Wenwen Yang, Qiunan Xu, Wenjian Liu
Abstract: Magnetic Weyl semimetals (WSM) have recently attracted much attention due to their potential in realizing strong anomalous Hall effects. Yet, how to design such systems remains unclear. Based on first-principles calculations, we show here that the ferromagnetic half-metallic compound In$_2$CoSe$_4$ has several pairs of Weyl points and is hence a good candidate for magnetic WSM. These Weyl points would approach the Fermi level gradually as the Hubbard $U$ increases, and finally disappear after a critical value $U_c$. The range of the Hubbard $U$ that can realize the magnetic WSM state can be expanded by pressure, manifesting the practical utility of the present prediction. Moreover, by generating two surface terminations at Co or In atom after cleaving the compound at the Co-Se bonds, the nontrivial Fermi arcs connecting one pair of Weyl points with opposite chirality are discovered in surface states. Furthermore, it is possible to observe the nontrivial surface state experimentally, e.g., angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. As such, the present findings imply strongly a new magnetic WSM which may host a large anomalous Hall conductivity.

Title: Photon Number Coherence in Quantum Dot-Cavity Systems can be Enhanced by Phonons
Authors: Paul C. A. Hagen, Mathieu Bozzio, Moritz Cygorek, Doris E. Reiter, Vollrath M. Axt
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots are a versatile source of single photons with tunable properties to be used in quantum-cryptographic applications. A crucial figure of merit of the emitted photons is photon number coherence (PNC), which impacts the security of many quantum communication protocols. In the process of single-photon generation, the quantum dot as a solid-state object is subject to an interaction with phonons, which can therefore indirectly affect the PNC. In this paper, we elaborate on the origin of PNC in optically excited quantum dots and how it is affected by phonons. In contrast to the expectation that phonons always deteriorate coherence, PNC can be increased in a quantum dot-cavity system due to the electron-phonon interaction.

Title: Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians: Reduced Memory Cost and Complexity Scaling via Tensor Hypercontraction
Authors: Yu Wang, Maxine Luo, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.

Title: Meta-Generalized-Gradient Approximation made Magnetic
Authors: Jacques K. Desmarais, Alessandro Erba, Giovanni Vignale, Stefano Pittalis
Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.

Title: Aspects of Hilbert space fragmentation in the quantum East model: fragmentation, subspace-restricted quantum scars, and effects of density-density interactions
Authors: Maitri Ganguli, Sreemayee Aditya, Diptiman Sen
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional correlated-hopping model of spinless fermions with an East constraint. We first analytically unravel the complete fragmentation structure of this model by labeling each fragment by a unique root configuration and utilizing the transfer matrix method. We show that the growth of the size of each fragment of the model follows the widely studied Dyck sequence, and is therefore analytically tractable with the help of Catalan triangles. While the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) does not hold within the full Hilbert space which exhibits Poisson statistics of the energy level spacing, an examination of various quantities restricted to the largest fragments shows that a weaker version of the subspace-restricted thermalization holds. This weaker violation of the ETH within the largest fragments is supported by the presence of subspace-restricted quantum many-body scars due to quantum fragmentation. Next, we show that the inclusion of a nearest-neighbor density-density interaction with strength $V$ induces a spectral transition within the largest fragment from a weakly ETH-violating phase containing scars to a statistical bubble localized phase as $V$ increases. In particular, the $V\to \infty$ limit produces an integrable model. We find that the addition of finite-$V$ stabilizes the ground state near half-filling while keeping intact the fragmentation structure of the East model. However, this behavior abruptly changes exactly at $V = \infty$ due to the emergence of a distinct fragmentation structure. The infinite-$V$ model has many interesting properties, among which the appearance of the ground state and the largest fragment at two different filling fractions is specially noteworthy. Finally, we propose an experimental setup to realize the infinite-$V$ model as a particular limit of a special kind of $t-V$ model with an on-site potential.

Title: Integration of Cobalt Ferromagnetic Control Gates for Electrical and Magnetic Manipulation of Semiconductor Quantum Dots
Authors: Fabio Bersano, Michele Aldeghi, Niccolò Martinolli, Victor Boureau, Thibault Aboud, Michele Ghini, Pasquale Scarlino, Gian Salis, Adrian Mihai Ionescu
Abstract: The rise of electron spin qubit architectures for quantum computing processors has led to a strong interest in designing and integrating ferromagnets to induce stray magnetic fields for electron dipole spin resonance (EDSR). The integration of nanomagnets imposes however strict layout and processing constraints, challenging the arrangement of different gating layers and the control of neighboring qubit frequencies. This work reports a successful integration of nano-sized cobalt control gates into a multi-gate FD-SOI nanowire with nanometer-scale dot-to-magnet pitch, simultaneously exploiting electrical and ferromagnetic properties of the gate stack at nanoscale. The electrical characterization of the multi-gate nanowire exhibits full field effect functionality of all ferromagnetic gates from room temperature to 10 mK, proving quantum dot formation when ferromagnets are operated as barrier gates. The front-end-of-line (FEOL) compatible integration of cobalt is examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and high/low frequency capacitance characterization, confirming the quality of interfaces and control over material diffusion. Insights into the magnetic properties of thin films and patterned control-gates are provided by vibrating sample magnetometry and electron holography measurements. Micromagnetic simulations anticipate that this structure fulfills the requirements for EDSR driving for magnetic fields higher than 1 T, where a homogeneous magnetization along the hard magnetic axis of the Co gates is expected. The FDSOI architecture showcased in this study provides a scalable alternative to micromagnets deposited in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) and middle-of-line (MOL) processes, while bringing technological insights for the FEOL-compatible integration of Co nanostructures in spin qubit devices.

Title: Programmable Magnetic Hysteresis in Orthogonally-Twisted Two-Dimensional CrSBr Magnets via Stacking Engineering
Authors: Carla Boix-Constant, Andrey Rybakov, Clara Miranda-Pérez, Gabriel Martínez-Carracedo, Jaime Ferrer, Samuel Mañas-Valero, Eugenio Coronado
Abstract: Twisting two-dimensional van der Waals magnets allows the formation and control of different spin-textures, as skyrmions or magnetic domains. Beyond the rotation angle, different spin reversal processes can be engineered by increasing the number of magnetic layers forming the twisted van der Waals heterostructure. Here, we consider pristine monolayers and bilayers of the A-type antiferromagnet CrSBr as building blocks. By rotating 90 degrees these units, we fabricate symmetric (monolayer/monolayer and bilayer/bilayer) and asymmetric (monolayer/bilayer) heterostructures. The magneto-transport properties reveal the appearance of magnetic hysteresis, which is highly dependent upon the magnitude and direction of the applied magnetic field and is determined not only by the twist-angle but also by the number of layers forming the stack. This high tunability allows switching between volatile and non-volatile magnetic memory at zero-field and controlling the appearance of abrupt magnetic reversal processes at either negative or positive field values on demand. The phenomenology is rationalized based on the different spin-switching processes occurring in the layers, as supported by micromagnetic simulations. Our results highlight the combination between twist-angle and number of layers as key elements for engineering spin-switching reversals in twisted magnets, of interest towards the miniaturization of spintronic devices and realizing novel spin textures.

Title: Antiferroelectric order in nematic liquids: Flexoelectricity vs electrostatics
Authors: Peter Medle Rupnik, Ema Hanžel, Matija Lovšin, Natan Osterman, Calum J. Gibb, Richard J. Mandle, Nerea Sebastián, Alenka Mertelj
Abstract: The recent discovery of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystalline phases marks a major breakthrough in soft matter research. An intermediate phase, often observed between the nonpolar and the ferroelectric nematic phase, shows a distinct antiferroelectric response to electric fields. However, its structure and formation mechanisms remain debated, with flexoelectric and electrostatics effects proposed as competing mechanisms. By controlling the magnitude of electrostatic forces through ion addition in two representative ferroelectric nematic materials, we show that the primary mechanism for the emergence of antiferroelectric order is the flexoelectric coupling between electric polarization and splay deformation of the nematic director. The addition of ions significantly expands the temperature range over which the antiferroelectric phase is observed, with this range increasing with increasing ion concentration. Polarizing optical microscopy studies and second harmonic generation microscopy reveal the splayed structure modulated in two dimensions, while SHG interferometry confirms its antiferroelectric character. We extend the model previously used to describe pretransitional behaviour by incorporating the electrostatic contribution of ions. The model shows qualitative agreement with the experiments, accurately reproducing the phase diagram and temperature-dependent evolution of the modulation period of the observed structure.

Title: Engineering Floquet moir\'e patterns for scalable photocurrents
Authors: Hernan L. Calvo, Luis E. F. Foa Torres, Matias Berdakin
Abstract: While intense laser irradiation and moiré engineering have independently proven powerful for tuning material properties on demand in condensed matter physics, their combination remains unexplored. Here we exploit tilted laser illumination to create spatially modulated light-matter interactions, leading to two striking phenomena in graphene. First, using two lasers tilted along the same axis, we create a quasi-1D supercell hosting a network of Floquet topological states that generate controllable and scalable photocurrents spanning the entire irradiated region. Second, by tilting lasers along orthogonal axes, we establish a 2D polarization moiré pattern giving rise to closed orbital propagation of Floquet states, reminiscent of bulk Landau states. These features, imprinted in the bulk of the irradiated region and controlled through laser wavelength and tilt angles, establish a new way for engineering quantum states through spatially modulated light-matter coupling.

Title: Mean first-passage time at the origin of a run-and-tumble particle with periodic forces
Authors: Pascal Grange, Linglong Yuan
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle on a half-line with an absorbing target at the origin. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between two fixed values at Poisson-distributed times. The particle evolves according to an overdamped Langevin dynamics with a spatially-periodic force field such that every point in a given period interval is accessible to the particle. The survival probability of the particle satisfies a backward Fokker--Planck equation, whose Laplace transform yields systems of equations satisfied by the moments of the first-passage time of the particle at the origin. The mean first-passage time has already been calculated assuming that the particle exits the system almost surely. We calculate the probability that the particle reaches the origin in a finite time, given its initial position and velocity. We obtain an integral condition on the force, under which the particle has a non-zero survival probability. The mean first-passage time of the particle (averaged over trajectories that reach the origin) is obtained in closed, both in the latter case and in the case of almost-sure exit. As an application, we consider a piecewise-constant force field that alternates periodically between two opposite values. In the limit where the period is short compared to the mean free path of the particle, the exit probability and the mean first-return time at the origin coincide with the values obtained in the case of an effective constant drift, which we calculate explicitly.

Title: Formations of generalized Wannier-Stark ladders: Theorem and applications
Authors: H.P. Zhang, Z. Song
Abstract: The Wannier-Stark ladder (WSL) is a basic concept, supporting periodic oscillation, widely used in many areas of physics. In this paper, we investigate the formations of WSL in generalized systems, including strongly correlated and non-Hermitian systems. We present a theorem on the existence of WSL for a set of general systems that are translationally symmetric before the addition of a linear potential. For a non-Hermitian system, the WSL becomes complex but maintains a real energy level spacing. We illustrate the theorem using 1D extended Bose-Hubbard models with both real and imaginary hopping strengths. It is shown that the Bloch-Zener oscillations of correlated bosons are particularly remarkable under resonant conditions. Numerical simulations for cases with boson numbers $n=2$, $3$, and $4$ are presented. Analytical and numerical results for the time evolution of the $n$-boson-occupied initial state indicate that all evolved states exhibit quasi periodic oscillations, but with different profiles, depending on the Hermiticity and interaction strength.

Title: Rotational Gr\"{u}neisen ratio: a probe for quantum criticality in anisotropic systems
Authors: Shohei Yuasa, Yohei Kono, Yuta Ozaki, Minoru Yamashita, Yasuyuki Shimura, Toshiro Takabatake, Shunichiro Kittaka
Abstract: The Grüneisen ratio $\Gamma$ and its magnetic analog, the magnetic Grüneisen ratio $\Gamma_H$, are powerful probes to study the nature of quantum phase transitions. Here, we propose a Grüneisen parameter, the rotational Grüneisen ratio $\Gamma_\phi$, by introducing the orientation of the external field as a control parameter. We investigate $\Gamma_\phi$ of the highly anisotropic paramagnets CeRhSn and CeIrSn by measuring the rotational magnetocaloric effect in a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields. We find that the $\Gamma_\phi$ data of both compounds are scaled by using the same critical exponents and the field-invariant critical field angle. Remarkably, the scaling function for the $\Gamma_\phi$ data reveals the presence of highly anisotropic quantum criticality that develops as a function of the easy-axis component of the magnetic field from the quantum critical line. This paper provides a thermodynamic approach to detect and identify magnetic quantum criticality in highly anisotropic systems.

Title: Thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without translational symmetry breaking
Authors: Peter Lunts, Aavishkar A. Patel, Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We describe the evolution of low-temperature thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions in Kondo lattice models without translational symmetry breaking. This transition moves from a heavy Fermi liquid with a conventional Luttinger-volume large Fermi surface to a 'FL*' state, characterized by a small Fermi surface and a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. The onset of the large Fermi surface phase is driven by the condensation of a Higgs field that carries a unit gauge charge under an emergent U(1) gauge field. We consider the case with spatially random Kondo exchange, as this leads to strange metal behavior in electrical transport. We find a large asymmetric thermopower in a 'skewed' marginal Fermi liquid, with similarities to the skewed non-Fermi liquid of Georges and Mravlje (arXiv:2102.13224). Our findings are consistent with recent observations in heavy fermion compounds (Z.-Y. Cao et al., arXiv:2408.13604), and describe an enhancement of thermopower on the large Fermi surface side as well as a non-monotonic behavior on the small Fermi surface side. Our results also apply to single-band Hubbard models and the pseudogap transition in the cuprates. In the ancilla framework, single-band models exhibit an inverted Kondo lattice transition: the small Fermi surface pseudogap state corresponds to the condensed Higgs state. This inversion results in an enhancement of thermopower on the pseudogap side in our theory, consistent with observations in the cuprates (C. Collignon et al., arXiv:2011.14927; A. Gourgout et al., arXiv:2106.05959). We argue that these observations support a non-symmetry-breaking Fermi-volume-changing transition as the underlying description of the onset of the pseudogap in the cuprates.

Title: Franck-Condon electron emission from polar semiconductor photocathodes
Authors: W. Andreas Schroeder, L. A. Angeloni, I-J. Shan, L. B. Jones
Abstract: A presented analytical formulation of (optical)phonon-mediated and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon emission of photoexcited electrons from polar semiconductors is shown to be very consistent with (i) the observed emission properties of a Cesiated GaAs(001) photocathode at 808nm [J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 54, 205301 (2021)] and (ii) the measured spectral emission properties of a GaN(0001) photocathode from just below its bandgap energy to 5eV. The theoretical analysis in the parabolic band approximation predicts the form of both the quantum efficiency and mean transverse energy of photoemission as a function of the photocathode's electron affinity and the electron temperature in the vicinity of its emission face. The good agreement between theory and experimental data also suggests that sub-10nm rms surface roughness effects are not significant for polar semiconductor photocathodes.

Title: Self-doped Molecular Mott Insulator for Bilayer High-Temperature Superconducting La3Ni2O7
Authors: Zhan Wang, Kun Jiang, Fu-Chun Zhang
Abstract: The bilayer structure of recently discovered high-temperature superconducting nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a new platform for investigating correlation and superconductivity. Starting from a bilayer Hubbard model, we show that there is a molecular Mott insulator limit forming by the bonding band owing to Hubbard interaction and large interlayer coupling. This molecular Mott insulator becomes self-doped from electrons transferred to the antibonding bands at a weaker interlayer coupling strength. The self-doped molecular Mott insulator is similar to the doped Mott insulator studied in cuprates. We propose La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a self-doped molecular Mott insulator, whose molecular Mott limit is formed by two nearly degenerate antisymmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Partial occupation of higher energy symmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital leads to self-doping, which may be responsible for high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Title: Infinite variety of thermodynamic speed limits with general activities
Authors: Ryuna Nagayama, Kohei Yoshimura, Sosuke Ito
Abstract: Activity, which represents the kinetic property of dynamics, plays a central role in obtaining thermodynamic speed limits (TSLs). In this paper, we discuss a unified framework that provides the existing TSLs based on different activities such as dynamical activity and dynamical state mobility. We also derive an infinite variety of TSLs for Markov jump processes and deterministic chemical reaction networks by using different activities defined by the generalized means. The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force. We numerically and analytically discuss the tightness of the lower bounds on the EPR in the various TSLs.

Title: Response of superfluid fermions at finite temperature
Authors: Sumit Bhattacharjee, Elena Litvinova
Abstract: A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete $4\times 4$ block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. The least correlated static kernel reproduces the known finite-temperature quasiparticle random phase approximation, while the dynamical kernel was previously largely unknown in the finite-temperature superfluid theory. The major focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is completed and advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem with keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex as well as the components of the dynamical kernel acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.

Title: Nucleation line in three-component Bose-Einstein condensates in Gross-Pitaevskii theory
Authors: Nguyen Van Thu
Abstract: By means of Gross-Pitaevskii theory we investigate the possibility of wetting phase transition in three-component Bose-Einstein condensates within the strong segregation between components 1 and 2. Third component plays the role of a surfactant, which can wet the interface formed by components 1 and 2. The case of symmetry of components 1 and 2, the equation for nucleation line and wetting phase diagram are studied. By linearizing the set of three-coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations, the wave functions of the components are found. An analytical approximation for the surfactant thickness in the prewetting phase is presented. The results indicate that the surfactant thickness in the prewtting phase varies linearly with the chemical potential ratio in the logarithmic scale.

Title: Two-fluid mobility model from coupled hydrodynamic equations for simulating laser-driven semiconductor switches
Authors: Qile Wu, Antonín Sojka, Brad D. Price, Nikolay I. Agladze, Anup Yadav, Sophie L. Pain, John D. Murphy, Tim Niewelt, Mark S. Sherwin
Abstract: We introduce a two-fluid mobility model incorporating fundamental aspects of electron-hole (e-h) scattering such as momentum conservation for simulating laser-driven semiconductor switches (LDSSs). Compared to previous works that use Matthiessen's rule, the two-fluid mobility model predicts distinct AC responses of e-h plasmas in semiconductors. Based on the two-fluid mobility model, we develop a theory with very few adjustable parameters for simulating the switching performance of LDSSs based on high-purity indirect-gap semiconductors such as silicon (Si). As a prototypical application, we successfully reproduce experimentally measured reflectance at around 320 GHz in a laser-driven Si switch. By injecting e-h plasmas with densities up to $10^{20}\,\rm cm^{-3}$, we reveal the importance of carrier-screening effects in e-h scattering and Auger recombination for carrier densities above the critical carrier density for exciton-plasma Mott transition. Our results also suggest a way to characterize the intrinsic momentum-relaxation mechanism, e-h scattering, and the intrinsic e-h recombination mechanism in indirect-gap semiconductors, Auger recombination. We reassess the ambipolar Auger coefficient of high-purity Si with high injection levels of e-h plasmas up to $10^{20}\,\rm cm^{-3}$ and find a minimal value of $1.8\times10^{-41}\,{\rm cm^6/ns}$. The value is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the ambipolar Auger coefficient widely used for simulating LDSSs, $3.8\times10^{-40}\,{\rm cm^6/ns}$, which was deduced from minority-carrier lifetime in highly doped silicon more than four decades ago.

Title: Resonant X-ray spectroscopies on Chromium $3\textit{d}$ orbitals in CrSBr
Authors: Victor Porée, Alberto Zobelli, Amit Pawbake, Jakub Regner, Zdenĕk Sofer, Clément Faugeras, Alessandro Nicolaou
Abstract: We investigate the Cr electronic structure and excitations in CrSBr, a layered magnetic semiconductor, using a combination of resonant x-ray spectroscopic techniques. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra collected at the Cr $L_{2,3}$ edges reveal significant linear dichroism, which arises from the distorted octahedral environment surrounding the Cr$^{3+}$ ions. The origin of the bright excitons observed in this compound is examined through a comparison of the d-d excitations identified in the RIXS spectra, the x-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) spectra, and previously reported optical spectroscopic and theoretical studies. To further understand these phenomena, we develop a multiplet model based on a crystal electric field (CEF) approach that accounts for the local environment of Cr ions. This model successfully reproduces several experimental features, while also suggesting strong hybridization effects between Cr $3\textit{d}$ orbitals and ligands that are not fully captured by the present framework. These findings advance our understanding of the electronic structure and excitonic behavior in CrSBr and provide a foundation for future $\textit{in-situ}$ and $\textit{operando}$ studies of CrSBr-based devices for spintronic and optoelectronic applications.

Title: Electron-phonon coupling in lattice engineering of lithium niobate single crystal thin films
Authors: Guoqiang Shi, Kunfeng Chen, Hui Hu, Gongbin Tang, Dongfeng Xue
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LN) single crystal thin films are a high-performance photonic platform with applications in electro-optic modulators, nonlinear optical devices, optical frequency combs, and acousto-optic modulators. LN's significance in photonics parallels silicon's in electronics, addressing challenges like high power consumption and slow communication speeds, and offering potential for broad applications in optical communications, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. Despite progress in developing LN-based photonic structures, achieving low-loss, reconfigurable, and large-scale devices requires improved processing techniques. This work introduces a quantum design methodology based on LN's crystal structure, utilizing electron-phonon coupling through external field perturbations. Multiscale structural analysis is performed with techniques such as time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption spectra to identify and control defect structures. Angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and Density Functional Theory further reveal the mechanisms of electron-phonon coupling. These findings establish a framework for designing LN-based quantum devices with enhanced performance and diverse functionalities.

Title: Social adaptive behavior and oscillatory prevalence in an epidemic model on evolving random geometric graphs

Abstract: Our recent experience with the COVID-19 pandemic amply shows that spatial effects like the mobility of agents and average interpersonal distance, together with the adaptation of agents, are very important in deciding the outcome of epidemic dynamics. Structural and dynamical aspects of random geometric graphs are widely employed in describing processes with a spatial dependence, such as the spread of an airborne disease. In this work, we investigate the interplay between spatial factors, such as agent mobility and average interpersonal distance, and the adaptive responses of individuals to an ongoing epidemic within the framework of random geometric graphs. We show that such spatial factors, together with the adaptive behavior of the agents in response to the prevailing level of global epidemic, can give rise to oscillatory prevalence even with the classical SIR framework. We characterize in detail the effects of social adaptation and mobility of agents on the disease dynamics and obtain the threshold values. We also study the effects of delayed adaptive response of agents on epidemic dynamics. We show that a delay in executing non-pharmaceutical spatial mitigation strategies can amplify oscillatory prevalence tendencies and can have non-linear effects on peak prevalence. This underscores the importance of early implementation of adaptive strategies coupled with the dissemination of real-time prevalence information to manage and control the epidemic effectively.

Title: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics at the onset of spin-spin correlations
Authors: Sebastián Roca-Jerat, Marcos Rubín-Osanz, Mark D. Jenkins, Agustín Camón, Pablo J. Alonso, David Zueco, Fernando Luis
Abstract: We explore the competition between light-mediated and intrinsic matter-matter interactions in waveguide quantum electrodynamics. For this, we couple a superconducting transmission line to a model magnetic material, made of organic free radical molecules with a spin $S=1/2$ and a $g_{S}$ factor very close to that of a free electron. The microwave transmission has been measured in a wide range of temperatures ($0.013$ K $\leq T \leq 2$ K), magnetic fields ($0\leq B \leq 0.5$ T) and frequencies ($0 \leq \omega/2 \pi \leq 14$ GHz). We find that molecules belonging to one of the two crystal sublattices form one-dimensional spin chains. Temperature then controls the intrinsic correlations along these chains in a continuous and monotonic way. In the paramagnetic region ($T > 0.7$ K), the microwave transmission shows evidences for the collective coupling of quasi-identical spins to the propagating photons, with coupling strengths that reach values close to the dissipation rates. As $T$ decreases, the growth of spin correlations, combined with the anisotropy in the spin-spin exchange constants, tend to suppress the collective spin-photon coupling. In this regime, the spin visibility in transmission reflects also a gradual change in the nature of the dominant spin excitations, from single spin flips to bosonic magnons.

Title: Nonlinearity-enhanced quantum sensing in Stark probes
Authors: Rozhin Yousefjani, Xingjian He, Angelo Carollo, Abolfazl Bayat
Abstract: Stark systems in which a linear gradient field is applied across a many-body system have recently been proposed for quantum sensing. Here, we explore sensing capacity of Stark probes, in both single-particle and many-body interacting systems, for estimating nonlinear forms of the gradient fields. Our analysis reveals that, this estimation can achieve super-Heisenberg scaling precision that grows linearly by increasing the nonlinearity. Specifically, we find a universal algebraic relation between the scaling of the precision and the degree of the nonlinearity. This universal behavior remains valid in both single-particle and many-body interacting probes and reflects itself in the properties of the phase transition from an extended to a localized phase, obtained through establishing a comprehensive finite-size scaling analysis. Considering a parabolic gradient potential composed of both linear and nonlinear fields, we used multi-parameter estimation methodology to estimate the components of the gradient potential. The phase diagram of the system is determined in terms of both linear and nonlinear gradient fields showing how the nonlocalized phase turns into a localized one as the Stark fields increase. The sensing precision of both linear and nonlinear Stark fields follows the same universal algebraic relation that was found for the case of single parameter sensing. We demonstrate that simple and experimentally available measurements can reach the theoretical precision bounds. Finally, we show that quantum enhanced sensitivity is still achievable even when we incorporate the preparation time of the probe into our resource analysis.

Title: Stable Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Systems with Heralded Noise
Authors: Sanket Chirame, Fiona J. Burnell, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Abhinav Prem
Abstract: We present a family of local quantum channels whose steady-states exhibit stable mixed-state symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. Motivated by recent experimental progress on "erasure conversion" techniques that allow one to identify ($\textit{herald}$) decoherence processes, we consider open systems with biased erasure noise, which leads to strongly symmetric heralded errors. We utilize this heralding to construct a local correction protocol that effectively confines errors into short-ranged pairs in the steady-state. Using a combination of numerical simulations and mean-field analysis, we show that our protocol stabilizes SPT order against a sufficiently low rate of decoherence. As the rate of heralded noise increases, SPT order is eventually lost through a directed percolation transition. We further find that while introducing unheralded errors destroys SPT order in the limit of long length- and time-scales, the correction protocol is sufficient for ensuring that local SPT order persists, with a correlation length that diverges as $\xi \sim (1-f_e)^{-1/2}$, where $f_e$ is the fraction of errors that are heralded.

Title: Inherent quantum resources in stationary spin chains
Authors: Marcin Płodzień, Jan Chwedeńczuk, Maciej Lewenstein
Abstract: The standard way to generate many-body quantum correlations is via a dynamical protocol: an initial product state is transformed by interactions that generate non-classical correlations at later times. Here, we show that many-body Bell correlations are inherently present in the eigenstates of a variety of spin-1/2 chains. In particular, we show that the eigenstates and thermal states of the collective Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model possess many-body Bell correlations. We demonstrate that the Bell correlations can take on quantized values that change discontinuously with variations in the total magnetization. Finally, we show that these many-body Bell correlations persist even in the presence of both diagonal and off-diagonal disorder.

Title: Gears in Chemical Reaction Networks: Optimizing Energy Transduction Efficiency
Authors: Massimo Bilancioni, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: Similarly to gear systems in vehicles, most chemical reaction networks (CRNs) involved in energy transduction have at their disposal multiple transduction pathways, each characterized by distinct efficiencies. We conceptualize these pathways as `chemical gears' and demonstrate their role in refining the second law of thermodynamics. This allows us to determine the optimal efficiency of a CRN, and the gear enabling it, solely based on its topology and operating conditions, defined by the chemical potentials of its input and output species. By suitably tuning reaction kinetics, a CRN can be engineered to self-regulate its gear settings, maintaining optimal efficiency under varying external conditions. We demonstrate this principle in a biological context with a CRN where enzymes function as gear shifters, autonomously adapting the system to achieve near-optimal efficiency across changing environments. Additionally, we examine artificial molecular motors and reveal that their gearing mechanisms are far from optimally regulated.

Title: Impact of dendritic non-linearities on the computational capabilities of neurons
Authors: Clarissa Lauditi, Enrico M. Malatesta, Fabrizio Pittorino, Carlo Baldassi, Nicolas Brunel, Riccardo Zecchina
Abstract: How neurons integrate the myriad synaptic inputs scattered across their dendrites is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Multiple neurophysiological experiments have shown that dendritic non-linearities can have a strong influence on synaptic input integration. These non-linearities have motivated mathematical descriptions of single neuron as a two-layer computational units, which have been shown to increase substantially the computational abilities of neurons, compared to linear dendritic integration. However, current analytical studies are restricted to neurons with unconstrained synaptic weights and unplausible dendritic non-linearities. Here, we introduce a two-layer model with sign-constrained synaptic weights and a biologically plausible form of dendritic non-linearity, and investigate its properties using both statistical physics methods and numerical simulations. We find that the dendritic non-linearity enhances both the number of possible learned input-output associations and the learning velocity. We characterize how capacity and learning speed depend on the implemented non-linearity and the levels of dendritic and somatic inhibition. We calculate analytically the distribution of synaptic weights in networks close to maximal capacity, and find that a large fraction of zero-weight ('silent' or 'potential') synapses naturally emerge in neurons with sign-constrained synapses, as a consequence of non-linear dendritic integration. Non-linearly induced sparsity comes with a second central advantage for neuronal information processing, i.e. input and synaptic noise robustness. We test our model on standard real-world benchmark datasets and observe empirically that the non-linearity provides an enhancement in generalization performance, showing that it enables to capture more complex input/output relations.

Title: Modelling competition for space: Emergent inefficiency and inequality due to spatial self-organization among a group of crowd-avoiding agents
Authors: Ann Mary Mathew, V Sasidevan
Abstract: Competition for a limited resource is the hallmark of many complex systems, and often, that resource turns out to be the physical space itself. In this work, we study a novel model designed to elucidate the dynamics and emergence in complex adaptive systems in which agents compete for some spatially spread resource. Specifically, in the model, the dynamics result from the agents trying to position themselves in the quest to avoid physical crowding experienced locally. We characterize in detail the dependence of the emergent behavior of the model on the population density of the system and the individual-level agent traits such as the extent of space an agent considers as her neighborhood, the limit of occupation density one tolerates within that neighborhood, and the information accessibility of the agents about neighborhood occupancy. We show that inefficiency in utilizing physical space shows transition at a specific density and peaks at another distinct density. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the variation of inefficiency relative to the information accessible to the agents exhibits contrasting behavior above and below this second density. We also look into the inequality of resource sharing in the model and show that although inefficiency can be a non-monotonic function of information depending upon the parameters of the model, inequality, in general, decreases with information. Our study sheds light on the role of competition, spatial constraints, and agent traits within complex adaptive systems, offering insights into their emergent behaviors.

Title: Measurement-induced transitions for interacting fermions
Authors: Igor Poboiko, Paul Pöpperl, Igor V. Gornyi, Alexander D. Mirlin
Abstract: Effect of measurements on interacting fermionic systems with particle-number conservation, whose dynamics is governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian, is studied. We develop Keldysh field-theoretical framework that provides a unified approach to observables characterizing entanglement and charge fluctuations. Within this framework, we derive a replicated Keldysh non-linear sigma model (NLSM), which incorporates boundary conditions specifically designed to produce generating functions for charge cumulants and entanglement entropies directly in the NLSM language. By using the renormalization-group approach for the NLSM, we determine the phase diagram and the scaling of physical observables. Crucially, the interaction-induced terms in the NLSM action reduce its symmetry, which affects the physics of the problem in a dramatic way. First, this leads to the "information-charge separation": charge cumulants get decoupled from entanglement entropies. Second, the interaction stabilizes the volume-law phase for the entanglement. Third, for spatial dimensionality $d=1$, the interaction stabilizes the phase with logarithmic growth of charge cumulants (in the thermodynamic limit). Thus, in the presence of interaction, there are measurement transitions in any $d$, at variance with free fermions, for which a $d=1$ system is always in the area-law phase. Analytical results are supported by numerical simulations using time-dependent variational principles for matrix product states, which, in particular, confirm the separation of information and charge as a hallmark of the delocalized phase.

Title: Existence of long-range order in random-field Ising model on Dyson hierarchical lattice
Authors: Manaka Okuyama, Masayuki Ohzeki
Abstract: We study the random-field Ising model on a Dyson hierarchical lattice, where the interactions decay in a power-law-like form, $J(r)\sim r^{-\alpha}$, with respect to the distance. Without a random field, the Ising model on the Dyson hierarchical lattice has a long-range order at finite low temperatures when $1<\alpha<2$. In this study, for $1<\alpha<3/2$, we rigorously prove that there is a long-range order in the random-field Ising model on the Dyson hierarchical lattice at finite low temperatures, including zero temperature, when the strength of the random field is sufficiently small but nonzero. Our proof is based on Dyson's method for the case without a random field, and the concentration inequalities in probability theory enable us to evaluate the effect of a random field.

Title: Machine-learned design principles for enhanced red emission from nitride quantum wells
Authors: Nick Pant, Rob Armitage, Emmanouil Kioupakis
Abstract: Significant effort has been devoted toward mitigating polarization fields in nitride LEDs, as they are viewed as detrimental to light emission, albeit with limited success for red emission. Here, we show that such fields can unusually enhance the optical oscillator strength of red-emitting nitride quantum wells. This insight is enabled by machine-learned models trained on multi-scale quantum-mechanical simulations, allowing for a global exploration of the quantum-well design space at greatly reduced computational cost. Larger polarization fields correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emission, a consequence of the quantum-confined Stark effect enabling thinner quantum wells. This finding has implications for designing efficient red nitride LEDs, which are crucial for miniaturizing polychromatic LED pixels to the micron scale for extended-reality and biomedical applications. More broadly, this work highlights the power of machine learning in accelerating the discovery of unconventional paradigms for semiconductor design.

Title: Wettability and Color Change of Copper by Controlling Area Fraction of Laser Ablated Surface
Authors: Mantas Gaidys, Stella Maragkaki, Alexandros Mimidis, Antonis Papadopoulos, Andreas Lemonis, Evangelos Skoulas, Andrius Žemaitis, Emmanuel Stratakis, Mindaugas Gedvilas
Abstract: In this research, wettability control by area fraction of laser ablated surface of copper is presented. The functional surfaces with full wettability control from highly hydrophilic to super-hydrophobic were created on copper by nanosecond (ns) and picosecond (ps) laser irradiation. The area fraction and color change were evaluated by digital image processing of microscopic images of the laser-ablated copper surface. The control of the wetting angle from almost 0 degrees to 132 degrees was achieved for both ps and ns pulses by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. Cassie, Cassie-Baxter, and Wenzel models were adopted to explain the experimental results. For the first time, the wettability and color of copper were controlled by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. It is expected that the current results make an impact on the heat exchanger technology of water heat sinks, cooling units, atmospheric water generators, and fog harvesting and impact numerous applications from power plants to solar thermal water systems devices where highly-hydrophilic to super hydrophobic copper can be applied.

Title: Deterministic printing and heterointegration of single colloidal quantum dot photon sources
Authors: Gregory G. Guymon, Hao A. Nguyen, David Sharp, Tommy Nguyen, Henry Lei, David S. Ginger, Kai-Mei C. Fu, Arka Majumdar, Brandi M. Cossairt, J. Devin MacKenzie
Abstract: Single nanoparticles are essential building blocks for next-generation quantum photonic technologies, however, scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies have remained largely out of reach. Here, we present a new electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model that exploits nanoscale dielectrophoretics to precisely print single colloidal quantum dots (QDs) with accuracies allowing for fully-additive nanoscale photonics integration. Using colossal-shelled QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this method overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic limitations, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub-zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity-QD integration and the first single-photon emission from printed QDs. This additive, zero-waste nanomanufacturing process offers a scalable, sustainable pathway for heterointegrating nanomaterials down to the single particle level.
