Title: Phase-space Generalized Brillouin Zone for spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Qingya Li, Hui Jiang, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: The generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) has been highly successful in characterizing the topology and band structure of non-Hermitian systems. However, its applicability has been challenged in spatially inhomogeneous settings, where the non-locality of non-Hermitian pumping competes with Wannier-Stark localization and quantum interference, potentially leading to highly non-exponential state accumulation. To transcend this major conceptual bottleneck, we develop a general phase-space GBZ formalism that encodes non-Bloch deformations in both position and momentum space, such as to accurately represent spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian pumping. A key new phenomenon is the bifurcation of the phase-space GBZ branches, which allows certain eigenstates to jump abruptly between different GBZ solutions at various points in real space. The freedom in the locations of such jumps opens up an emergent degree of freedom that protects the stability of real spectra and, more impressively, the robustness of a new class of topological zero modes unique to GBZ this http URL response from these novel spectral and GBZ singularities can be readily demonstrated in mature metamaterial platforms such as photonic crystals or circuit arrays, where effective real-space hoppings can be engineered in a versatile this http URL framework directly generalizes to more complicated unit cells and further hoppings, opening up a vast new arena for exploring unconventional spectral and topological transitions as well as GBZ fragmentation in spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian settings.

Title: Hydrodynamic Equations for a system with translational and rotational dynamics
Authors: Akira Yoshimori, Shankar P. Das
Abstract: We obtain the equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics for many-particle systems whose microscopic units have both translational and rotational motion. The orientational dynamics of each element are studied in terms of the rotational Brownian motion of a corresponding fixed-length director ${\bf u}$. The time evolution of a set of collective densities $\{\hat{\psi}\}$ is obtained as an exact representation of the corresponding microscopic dynamics. For the Smoluchowski dynamics, noise in the Langevin equation for the director ${\bf u}$ is multiplicative. We obtain that the equation of motion for the collective number-density has two different forms, respectively, for the Ito and Stratonvich interpretation of the multiplicative noise in the ${\bf u}$-equation. Without the ${\bf u}$ variable, both reduce to the Standard Dean-Kawasaki form. Next, we average the microscopic equations for the collective densities $\{\hat{\psi}\}$ (which are, at this stage, a collection of Dirac delta functions) over phase space variables and obtain a corresponding set of stochastic partial differential equations for the coarse-grained densities $\{\psi\}$ with smooth spatial and temporal dependence. The coarse-grained equations of motion for the collective densities $\{\psi\}$ constitute the fluctuating non-linear hydrodynamics for the fluid with both rotational and translational dynamics. From the stationary solution of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, we obtain a free energy functional ${\cal F}[\psi]$ and demonstrate the relation between the ${\cal F}[\psi]$s for different levels of the FNH descriptions with its corresponding set of $\{\psi\}$.

Title: Wave dynamics in a macroscopic square artificial spin ice
Authors: L. Scafuri, D. A. Bozhko, E. Iacocca
Abstract: A macroscopic square artificial spin ice, or macro-ASI, is a collection of bar magnets placed in a square lattice arrangement. Each magnet is supported by hinges that allow their mechanical rotation. Previous investigations in these structures have shown ground-state configurations and driven dynamics similar to those of their nanosized counterparts. Here, we numerically investigate the impact of a defect, a Dirac string, on the driven dynamics. We find that waves quickly lose coherence by scattering between modes in this system. In addition, we observe a distinct mode associated with the isolated oscillation of the Dirac string. As expected from spatial localization, this resonant mode is under the band of propagating waves in the macro-ASI. The results are analogous to the development of low-frequency edge modes in nanoscopic spin ices in the presence of defects. Our results provide valuable insight into the physics of mechano-magnetic systems, demonstrating the existence of wave scattering and spatial confinement phenomena in macro-ASIs.

Title: Quantitative analysis of vectorial torques in thin 3d Co ferromagnet using orbital-spin conversion
Authors: B. Bony, S. Krishnia, Y. Xu, S. Collin, A. Fert, J.-M. George, M. Viret, V. Cros, H. Jaffrès
Abstract: Recent findings in orbitronics pointed out large current-induced torques originating, in the current understanding, from incident orbital currents. These are generated by orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect (OREE) produced at the interface between some light metal and oxides films e.g. by naturally oxidized copper layer (Cu*). In the present work, by using second harmonic Hall techniques, we determine the ratio of orbital vs spin currents exerting torques on thin transition metals Co ferromagnet in systems using an orbit-to-spin Pt converter as interlayer with Cu*. Our results quantifying damping like torques show that both orbital and spin currents are enhanced in these systems. Moreover, the experimental determination of the decoherence length in a sample series with varying Co thickness clearly demonstrates the interfacial generation of the orbital currents in Cu* by Orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects (REE) leading to subsequent magnetic torque in Co over a typical lengthscale of several nanometers

Title: A coreless giant vortex in a very strongly dipolar condensate of NaCs molecules
Authors: S K Adhikari
Abstract: A strongly dipolar $^{164}$Dy condensate of dipolar length $a_{\mathrm{dd}}=130.8a_0$, with $a_0$ the Bohr radius, hosts a wide variety of eigenstates, such as droplet, droplet-lattice, and ring-topology states, and self-bound droplets. Motivated by the observation of a very strongly dipolar condensate of NaCs molecules [Bigagli N et al. 2024 Nature 631 289], we demonstrate by numerical simulation, using an improved mean-field model, including the Lee-Huang-Yang interaction, that in a very strongly dipolar NaCs condensate with $a_{\mathrm{dd}} = 2000a_0$, most of the above-mentioned states continue to exist and can appear for a much smaller number $N$ of particles ($N \lessapprox 1000$) within the present experimental possibility. However, in a single-component harmonically-trapped rotating NaCs condensate, a new type of coreless giant-vortex states, with a phase drop of $2 \pi L$ along a closed path around the axis of rotation, appear, where $L$ is the angular momentum of the vortex.

Title: Magnetic-field effect on excitonic condensation emergent in extended Falicov-Kimball model
Authors: Naoya Ohta, Joji Nasu
Abstract: We investigate the effects of magnetic fields on excitonic condensation in the extended Falicov-Kimball model, which is a spinless two-orbital Hubbard model with orbital splitting. In lattice systems under magnetic fields up to several tens of teslas, Zeeman effects on electron spins have been extensively studied, while the impact on orbital motion has often been considered negligible. However, the recent capability to generate ultra-high magnetic fields exceeding 1000 T has renewed interest in understanding their influence on ordered phases in correlated electron systems, beyond spin-related phenomena. To examine these effects, we incorporate a magnetic field into the extended Falicov-Kimball model by introducing the Peierls phase into the transfer integrals, enabling the study of orbital motion. Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we reveal a nonmonotonic response of the excitonic order parameter to increasing magnetic fields. At sufficiently high fields, the excitonic order is suppressed, resulting in a disordered insulating state characterized by partial occupation of the two orbitals with nonzero Chern numbers. This state is distinct from a fully orbital-polarized configuration. Furthermore, our analysis of an excitonic supersolid phase, in which excitonic and orbital orders coexist, demonstrates that orbital order remains robust under magnetic fields, while excitonic condensation is suppressed. These findings provide insights into the interplay between orbital motion and magnetic fields in multi-orbital correlated electron systems.

Title: Irreversible swap algorithms for soft sphere glasses
Authors: Yoshihiko Nishikawa, Federico Ghimenti, Ludovic Berthier, Frédéric van Wijland
Abstract: We extend to soft repulsive interaction potentials a recently proposed irreversible swap algorithm originally designed for polydisperse hard spheres. The original algorithm performs rejection-free, irreversible, collective swap moves. We show that event-driven cluster updates of particle diameters can also be performed in continuous potentials by introducing a factorised Metropolis probability. However, the Metropolis factorisation needed to deal with continuous potentials decreases the efficiency of the algorithm and mitigates the benefits of breaking detailed balance. This leads us to propose another irreversible swap algorithm using the standard Metropolis probability that accelerates the relaxation of soft sphere glasses at low temperatures, compared to the original swap algorithm. We apply these efficient swap algorithms to produce very stable inherent structures with vibrational density of states lacking the quasi-localised excitations observed in conventional glasses.

Title: Simultaneous achievement of large anomalous Nernst effect and reduced thermal conductivity in sintered polycrystalline topological Heusler ferromagnets
Authors: Koichi Oyanagi, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Kenta Takamori, Terumasa Tadano, Takumi Imamura, Ren Nagasawa, Krishnan Mahalingam, Takamasa Hirai, Fuyuki Ando, Yuya Sakuraba, Satoru Kobayashi, Ken-ichi Uchida
Abstract: This study reports the observation of the large anomalous Nernst effect in polycrystalline ferromagnetic Co$_{2}$MnGa (CMG) slabs prepared by a spark plasma sintering method. By optimizing the sintering conditions, the anomalous Nernst coefficient reaches ~7.5 $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, comparable to the highest value reported in the single-crystalline CMG slabs. Owing to the sizable anomalous Nernst coefficient and reduced thermal conductivity, the dimensionless figure of merit in our optimized CMG slab shows the record-high value of ~8$\times$10$^{-4}$ at room temperature. With the aid of the nano/microstructure characterization and first-principles phonon calculation, this study discusses the dependence of the transport properties on the degree of crystalline ordering and morphology of crystal-domain boundaries in the sintered CMG slabs. The results reveal a potential of polycrystalline topological materials for transverse thermoelectric applications, enabling the construction of large-scale modules.

Title: Mapping the three-dimensional fermiology of the triangular lattice magnet EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$
Authors: J. Green, Harry W. T. Morgan, Morgaine Mandigo-Stoba, William T. Laderer, Kuan-Yu Wey, Asari G. Prado, Chris Jozwiak, Aaron Bostwick, Eli Rotenberg, Christopher Gutiérrez, Anastassia N. Alexandrova, Ni Ni
Abstract: In this paper, we report the temperature-field phase diagram as well as present a comprehensive study of the electronic structure and three-dimensional fermiology of the triangular-lattice magnet EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, utilizing quantum oscillation measurements, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The complex magnetic phase diagram of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ highlights many transitions through nontrivial AFM states. Shubnikov-de Haas and de Haas-van Alphen oscillations were observed in the polarized ferromagnetic state of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, revealing three pairs of distinct spin-split frequency branches with small effective masses. A comparison of the angle-dependent oscillation data with first-principles calculations in the ferromagnetic state and angle-resolved photoemission spectra shows good agreement, identifying tubular hole pockets and hourglass-shaped hole pockets at the Brillouin zone center, as well as diamond-shaped electron pockets at the zone boundary. As the temperature increases, the frequency branches of the tiny hourglass pockets evolve into a more cylindrical shape, while the larger pockets remain unchanged. This highlights that variations in exchange splitting, driven by changes in the magnetic moment, primarily impact the small Fermi pockets without significantly altering the overall band structure. This is consistent with first-principles calculations, which show minimal changes near the Fermi level across ferromagnetic and simple antiferromagnetic states or under varying on-site Coulomb repulsion.

Title: In-plane anisotropy of charge density wave fluctuations in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$
Authors: Xuefei Guo, Anshul Kogar, Jans Henke, Felix Flicker, Fernando de Juan, Stella X.-L. Sun, Issam Khayr, Yingying Peng, Sangjun Lee, Matthew J. Krogstad, Stephan Rosenkranz, Raymond Osborn, Jacob P. C. Ruff, David B. Lioi, Goran Karapetrov, Daniel J. Campbell, Johnpierre Paglione, Jasper van Wezel, Tai C. Chiang, Peter Abbamonte
Abstract: We report measurements of anisotropic triple-$q$ charge density wave (CDW) fluctuations in the transition metal dichalcogenide 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ over a large volume of reciprocal space with X-ray diffuse scattering. Above the transition temperature, $T_{\text{CDW}}$, the out-of-plane diffuse scattering is characterized by rod-like structures which indicate that the CDW fluctuations in neighboring layers are largely decoupled. In addition, the in-plane diffuse scattering is marked by ellipses which reveal that the in-plane fluctuations are anisotropic. Our analysis of the diffuse scattering line shapes and orientations suggests that the three charge density wave components contain independent phase fluctuations. At $T_{\text{CDW}}$, long range coherence is established in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, consistent with the large observed value of the CDW gap compared to $T_{\text{CDW}}$, and the predicted presence of a hierarchy of energy scales.

Title: Giant topological Hall effect in epitaxial Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$/La$_{0.65}$Sr$_{0.35}$MnO$_3$ thin film heterostructures
Authors: Kusampal Yadav, Dilruba Hasina, Nasiruddin Mondal, Sayantika Bhowal, Devajyoti Mukherjee
Abstract: The emergence of new physical properties at the interfaces between complex oxides has always been of both fundamental and practical importance. Here, we report the observation of a giant topological Hall resistivity of $\sim 2.8 \mu \Omega$ \text{cm} at room temperature in an epitaxial thin-film heterostructure of permalloy (Py, Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$) and the half-metallic ferromagnet La$_{0.65}$Sr$_{0.35}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO). This large magnitude of the topological Hall effect in the Py/LSMO heterostructure, compared to a single-layer Py thin film, is attributed to the optimized combination of ferromagnetism in LSMO and the strong spin-orbit-coupling-driven Rashba interaction at the interface. The introduction of a ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) sandwich layer in the Py/LSMO heterostructure also leads to an enhanced topological Hall resistivity compared to the single-layer Py thin film. Interestingly, magnetic force microscopy measurements reveal skyrmion-like features, suggesting the origin of the topological Hall effect. Our theoretical model calculations for the skyrmion lattice further indicate that the Rashba interaction, driven by the broken inversion symmetry in the Py/LSMO films, can account for the observed changes in the topological Hall effect at the interface. Our work opens the door for the potential use of Py/LSMO thin films in spintronic applications.

Title: Room-Temperature Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Terbium monohalide
Authors: Jianqi Zhong, Jianzhou Zhao, Jinyu Zou, Gang Xu
Abstract: Following the successful experimental realization of the long-sought Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in thin films of chromium-doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$, enhancing the work temperature of QAH effect has emerged as a significant and challenging task in condensed matter physics. In this work, we demonstrate monolayer TbCl as a promising candidate to realize the room temperature QAH effect. Based on density functional theory + HSE hybrid functional, we identify the topological properties with Hall conductivity $G = -e^2/h$ per layer in three-dimensional ferromagnetic insulator TbCl, which is weakly staked by the QAH layers. The monolayer TbCl inherits the magnetic and topological properties, and exhibits the QAH effect corresponding to the Chern number $C=-1$. The topological band gap is significantly large and reaches 42.8 meV, which is beyond room temperatue. Meanwhile, the magnetic study finds that the extended $5d$ electrons contribute to the magnetic momentum of Tb and lead to sizable exchange and superexchange interactions, resulting in a high Curie temperature $T_c \sim 457$K. All these features demonstrate that monolayer TbCl will provide an ideal platform to realize the room temperature QAH effect.

Title: Out-of-equilibrium critical dynamics of the three-dimensional ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge model along critical relaxational flows
Authors: Claudio Bonati, Haralambos Panagopoulos, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We address the out-of-equilibrium critical dynamics of the three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge model, and in particular the critical relaxational flows arising from instantaneous quenches to the critical point, driven by purely relaxational (single-spin-flip Metropolis) upgradings of the link ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge variables. We monitor the critical relaxational dynamics by computing the energy density, which is the simplest local gauge-invariant quantity that can be measured in a lattice gauge theory. The critical relaxational flow of the three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge model is analyzed within an out-of-equilibrium finite-size scaling framework, which allows us to compute the dynamic critical exponent $z$ associated with the purely relaxational dynamics of the three-dimensional ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge universality class. We obtain $z=2.610(15)$, which significantly improves earlier results obtained by other methods, in particular those obtained by analyzing the equilibrium critical dynamics.

Title: Two-dimensional ferroelectric crystal with temperature-invariant ultralow thermal conductivity
Authors: Wenjie Zhou, Shi Liu
Abstract: We report the discovery of temperature-invariant ultralow thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) in monolayer \bpinse, a two-dimensional ferroelectric crystal with in-plane polarization. Using a combination of generalized Wigner transport equation theory and machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal that the balance between particle-like phonon propagating and wave-like tunneling transport mechanisms results in a propagating-tunneling-invariant (PTI) ultralow thermal conductivity of approximately 0.6 W/mK (comparable to that of glass) over a broad temperature range ($150<T<800$~K). This behavior stems from intrinsic strong lattice anharmonicity driven by ferroelectric dipolar fluctuations, eliminating the need for extrinsic structural modifications. In contrast, the \ainse~monolayer, which shares the same stoichiometry, exhibits a conventional temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, $\kappa (T) \propto T^{-1}$, typical of simple crystals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anharmonicity in \bpinse~can be precisely modulated by an external electric field, enabling on-demand control of thermal transport properties, including modifying the temperature scaling behavior of heat conductivity and achieving a large thermal switching ratio of $\approx$2.5. These findings provide fundamental insights into the interplay between field-tunable lattice anharmonicity, phonon dynamics, and thermal transport mechanisms.

Title: Triangular and dice quasicrystals modulated by generic 1D aperiodic sequences
Authors: Toranosuke Matsubara, Akihisa Koga, Tomonari Dotera
Abstract: We present a method for generating hexagonal aperiodic tilings that are topologically equivalent to the triangular and dice lattices. This approach incorporates aperiodic sequences into the spacing between three sets of grids for the triangular lattice, resulting in "modulated triangular lattices". Subsequently, by replacing the triangles with rhombuses, parallelograms, or hexagons, modulated dice or honeycomb lattices are constructed. Using generalized Fibonacci, Thue-Morse, and tribonacci sequences, we demonstrate several examples of hexagonal aperiodic tilings. Structural analysis confirms that their diffraction patterns reflect the properties of the one-dimensional aperiodic sequences, namely pure point (Bragg peaks) or singular continuous. Our method establishes a general framework for constructing a broad range of hexagonal aperiodic systems, advancing aperiodic-crystal research into higher dimensions that were previously focused on one-dimensional aperiodic sequences.

Title: Hall Coefficient of the Intercalated Graphite CaC$_6$ in the Uniaxial CDW Ground State
Authors: Petra Đurkas Grozić, Barbara Keran, Anatoly M. Kadigrobov, Zoran Rukelj, Ivan Kupčić, Danko Radić
Abstract: We evaluate the Hall coefficient characterising magnetotransport in an intercalated graphite CaC$_6$ with the Fermi surface reconstructed by an uniaxial charge density wave from closed pockets to open sheets. As the typical order parameter, corresponding to the pseudo-gap in electronic spectrum and consequently to spacing between electron trajectories in reciprocal space, is of the order of $10^2$K, magnetic breakdown in strong experimentally achievable fields of the order of 10T is inevitable. The classical expressions for the components of the magnetoconductivity tensor are strongly modified by magnetic field-assisted over-gap tunneling causing quantum interference. Due to magnetic breakdown, all magnetoconductivity components undergo strong quantum oscillations reflected in the Hall coefficient. In their nature, these are different than standard Shubnikov de Haas oscillations which would not appear in a system with an open Fermi surface.

Title: Transformations in Perovskite Photovoltaics: Film Formation, Processing Conditions, and Recovery Outlook
Authors: Bidisha Nath, Jeykishan Kumar, Sushant K Behera, Praveen C Ramamurthy, Debiprosad Roy Mahapatra, Gopalkrishna Hegde
Abstract: Organometallic halide perovskites have garnered considerable attention in recent times due to their promising optoelectronic attributes, particularly within the realm of solar photovoltaics (PV). How perovskite films form is of utmost significance in shaping their structural and functional characteristics. In this context, the application of methylamine vapour during the precursor deposition and subsequent treatment during the film formation stages emerges as crucial for the development of high-quality perovskite films for solar cell applications. The utilization of methylamine vapour annealing is pivotal in improving the crystallinity, morphology, and overall integrity of perovskite films. This work investigates the characteristics of perovskite films based on methylamine lead iodide, focusing on aspects such as crystallographic structure and vibrational modes, which are directly linked to the performance of the devices. The maximum power conversion efficiencies (PCE) obtained are 19.5% and 18.6% using 1-step and 2-step processes are obtained. The effect of factors like trap states, film homogeneity, and interfaces on the device performance are explored through capacitance measurements, photoluminescence, and electroluminescence behaviour. The recombination behaviour of the perovskite films is correlated with the crystallographic properties. These findings provide valuable insights into the influence of different processing techniques, such as methylamine vapour treatment and vacuum annealing, on rejuvenating perovskite solar cells.

Title: Phase and sulfur vacancy engineering in cadmium sulfide for boosting hydrogen production from catalytic plastic waste photoconversion
Authors: Thanh Tam Nguyen, Jacqueline Hidalgo-Jiménez, Xavier Sauvage (GPM), Katsuhiko Saito, Qixin Guo, Kaveh Edalati (WPI-I2CNER)
Abstract: Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is a well-known low-bandgap photocatalyst, but its efficiency is often hindered by rapid photo-generated carrier recombination and a limited number of active catalytic sites. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces an efficient CdS photocatalyst through a novel strategy combining metastable-to-stable phase transformation and sulfur vacancy generation. This strategy integrates hydrothermal treatment and a high-pressure process to create sulfur vacancies, which serve as active catalytic sites, within a thermodynamically stable wurtzite (hexagonal) phase known for its superior photocatalytic properties. The resulting CdS photocatalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in photoreforming for hydrogen production and the conversion of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic into valuable materials. Compared to commercial CdS catalysts, this new material shows a 23-fold increase in both hydrogen production and plastic degradation without the need for co-catalysts. Quenching experiments reveal that holes and hydroxyl radicals play crucial roles in the photoreforming process of this vacancy-rich CdS. First-principles calculations via density functional theory (DFT) indicate that the hexagonal phase possesses a lower bandgap and it exhibits further bandgap narrowing with the introduction of sulfur vacancies. These findings not only present an innovative approach to CdS processing but also highlight the critical role of sulfur vacancies as effective defects for the catalytic photoreforming of microplastics.

Title: Experimental realization of the ground state for the antiferromagnetic Ising model on a triangular lattice
Authors: Ke Wang, Xing-Jian Liu, Li-Ming Tu, Jia-Jie Zhang, Vladimir N. Gladilin, Jun-Yi Ge
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic Ising model on a triangular lattice (AFIT) exemplifies the most classical frustration system, arising from its triangular geometry that prevents all interactions from being simultaneously satisfied. Understanding geometric frustration in AFIT is crucial for advancing our knowledge of materials science and complex phases of matter. Here, we present a simple platform to study AFIT by arranging cylindrical magnets in vertical cavities of a triangular lattice, where magnets can slide along the cavity axis and stabilize either at the bottom or at the top of the cavity, analogous to the bistability of the Ising spin. The strong interactions of the magnets and the unique growing process allow the frustrated behavior and its ground state configurations to be directly observed. Notably, we observe a curved stripe phase, which is exotic to the Ising model. An effective thermalization process is developed to minimize the interaction energy, facilitating the evolution of various magnetic states, thereby visually realizing the ground state antiferromagnetic Ising model. Theoretical simulations and machine learning are performed concurrently to reveal the ground state and its evolution under effective thermal fluctuations, which are remarkably consistent with experimental results. Our system provides a unique platform to study frustrated systems and pave the way for future explorations in complex geometries.

Title: Thermodynamic properties of fcc lead: A scalar and fully relativistic first principle study
Authors: Balaram Thakur, Xuejun Gong, Andrea Dal Corso
Abstract: This study investigates the thermodynamic properties of face-centered cubic lead (fcc-Pb) using ab-initio methods within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA), examining the influence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the exchange-correlation functionals. Two types of ultrasoft pseudopotential (US-PP) are considered: one that excludes (scalar relativistic PP) and one that includes the SOC effects (fully relativistic PP). Further, for each PP, we test the performance of three popular exchange-correlation functionals: Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBE) (Perdew et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 3865 (1996)), PBE modified for dense solids (PBEsol) (Perdew et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 136406 (2008)), and local density approximation (LDA) (Perdew et al. Phys. Rev. B 23, 5048 (1981)). We calculate the Helmholtz free energy, incorporating lattice vibrations (phonons) and electronic excitation contributions. The estimated equation of state (at 4 K and 301 K), phonon dispersions (at 100 K and 300 K), mode-Grüneisen parameters ({\gamma}q{\eta}) (at 100 K), volume thermal expansion coefficient (\b{eta}), isobaric heat capacity (CP), bulk modulus (BS), and thermodynamic average Grüneisen parameter ({\gamma}) are compared with the available experimental and theoretical studies. Moreover, the 0 K pressure-dependent elastic constant-coefficient (Cij) of fcc lead and Pugh ratio, Debye temperature, and longitudinal and transverse sound velocities for polycrystalline lead are presented. The contributions of electronic excitations in all the thermodynamic properties are found to be negligible. With increasing pressure, the role of spin-orbit effects decreases but does not vanish. Our findings demonstrate that SOC leads to results distinct from the SR approach, but agreement with the experiment is not consistently improved by including SOC.

Title: Emergent scales and spatial correlations at the yielding transition of glassy materials
Authors: Stefano Aime, Domenico Truzzolillo
Abstract: Glassy materials yield under large external mechanical solicitations. Under oscillatory shear, yielding shows a well-known rheological fingerprint, common to samples with widely different microstructures. At the microscale, this corresponds to a transition between slow, solid-like dynamics and faster liquid-like dynamics, which can coexist at yielding in a finite range of strain amplitudes. Here, we capture this phenomenology in a lattice model with two main parameters: glassiness and disorder, describing the average coupling between adjacent lattice sites, and their variance, respectively. In absence of disorder, our model yields a law of correspondent states equivalent to trajectories on a cusp catastrophe manifold, a well-known class of problems including equilibrium liquid-vapour phase transitions. Introducing a finite disorder in our model entails a qualitative change, to a continuous and rounded transition, whose extent is controlled by the magnitude of the disorder. We show that a spatial correlation length $\xi$ emerges spontaneously from the coupling between disorder and bifurcating dynamics. With vanishing disorder, $\xi$ diverges and yielding becomes discontinuous, suggesting that the abruptness of yielding can be rationalized in terms of a lengthscale of dynamic heterogeneities.

Title: Symmetry-adapted closest Wannier modeling based on complete multipole basis set
Authors: Rikuto Oiwa, Akane Inda, Satoru Hayami, Takuya Nomoto, Ryotaro Arita, Hiroaki Kusunose
Abstract: We have developed a method to construct a symmetry-adapted Wannier tight-binding model based on the closest Wannier formalism and the symmetry-adapted multipole theory. Since the symmetry properties of the closest Wannier functions are common to those of the original atomic orbitals, symmetry-adapted multipole basis (SAMB) can be defined as the complete orthonormal matrix basis set in the Hilbert space of the closest Wannier functions. Utilizing the completeness and orthonormality of SAMBs, the closest Wannier Hamiltonian can be expressed as a linear combination of SAMBs belonging to the identity irreducible representation, thereby fully restoring the symmetry of the system. Moreover, the linear coefficients of each SAMB (model parameters) related to crystalline electric fields, spin-orbit coupling, and electron hoppings are determined through simple matrix projection without any iterative procedure. Thus, this method allows us to unveil mutual interplay among hidden electronic multipole degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonian and numerically evaluate them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by modeling monolayer graphene under a perpendicular electric field, highlighting its utility in symmetrizing the closest Wannier model, quantifying symmetry breaking, and predicting unusual responses. The method is implemented in the open-source Python library SymClosestWannier, with the codes available on GitHub (this https URL).

Title: Optical probes of two-component pairing states in transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Miguel-Ángel Sánchez-Martínez, Daniel Muñoz-Segovia, Fernando de Juan
Abstract: Certain transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures based on 2H-NbSe$_2$ and 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ have recently displayed surprising signatures of unconventional superconductivity. While the pairing channel remains unknown, it has been argued that spin fluctuations should lead to a two-component $E'$ pairing state which is compatible with some experimental features. Exploiting the particular multi-orbital character of the Fermi surface and the presence of Ising spin-orbit coupling which enable finite optical conductivity in the clean limit, in this work we predict clear-cut optical signatures of the chiral and nematic ground states of the $E'$ pairing. In particular, we show how the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and threefold symmetry are reflected in the optical Hall and anisotropic conductivities, respectively, while different spectral features can be connected with the momentum dependence of the gap functions. Our work provides a fingerprint that can be measured experimentally, constraining the pairing channel in TMD superconductors, and will help determine whether superconductivity is topological in these systems.

Title: Butterfly Patterns for Stretched Inhomogeneous Gel Networks using Large-Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Katsumi Hagita, Takahiro Murashima
Abstract: Large-scale coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of inhomogeneous gel networks were performed to investigate abnormal butterfly patterns in two-dimensional scattering. The networks were diamond lattice-based with distributions in the number of beads between the crosslink points. Remarkably, the results confirm that the abnormal butterfly pattern orig-inates from stronger inhomogeneity. For the examined systems, the range of scattering wavevector q for the normal butterfly pattern was markedly different from those for the abnormal butterfly patterns. The findings address an essential aspect of the discrepancy between theorical prediction and experimental observations.

Title: Topological-to-Topological Transition Induced by On-Site Nonlinearity in a One-Dimensional Topological Insulator
Authors: Kazuki Sone, Yasuhiro Hatsugai
Abstract: Recent studies have extended the notion of band topology to nonlinear systems by defining nonlinear counterparts of eigenvalue problems. They have found the nonlinearity-induced topological transition, while it has required complicated nonlinearity such as off-diagonal one. Thus, the existence of nonlinearity-induced transitions has been unclear under homogeneous on-site nonlinearity, which is ubiquitously found in nature. We here reveal that such on-site nonlinearity can induce transitions of topological modes, where topological modes converging to zero begin to converge to nonzero values. Since such nonlinearity-induced transition remains the bulk band topology unchanged, we can regard it as a transition from a conventional topological mode to one unique to nonlinear systems. We analyze a nonlinear eigenvalue problem by rewriting it to a dynamical system in the spatial direction and clarify that the nonlinearity-induced transition is a result of the bifurcation in the spatial dynamics. We also propose a possible setup to observe the nonlinearity-induced transition that uses a gradual amplification of nonlinear waves. These results provide a general designing principle of topological insulators controlled by nonlinearity.

Authors: Giselle A. Elbaz, Pierre-Louis Julliard, Mikaël Cassé, Heimanu Niebojewski, Benoit Bertrand, Grégoire Roussely, Valentin Labracherie, Maud Vinet, Tristan Meunier, Bruna Cardoso Paz
Abstract: Different groups worldwide have been working with the GlobalFoundries 22nm platform (22FDX) with the hopes of industrializing the fabrication of Si spin qubits. To guide this effort, we have performed a systematic study of six of the foundry's processes of reference (POR). Using effective mobility as a figure of merit, we study the impact of gate stack, channel type and back bias as a function of temperature. This screening process selected qubit devices that allowed us to couple quantum dots along both the length and width of the Si channel. We present stability diagrams with clear and regular honeycomb patterns, where spurious elements such as dopants are not observed. By combining these results with room and low temperature simulations, we provide insights into potential technology optimizations and show both the utility of qubit pre-screening protocols as well as the advantages of leveraging forward body bias within an FDSOI (Fully Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator) qubit platform.

Title: Simultaneous mapping of the ultrafast time and fluence dependence of the laser-induced insulator-to-metal transition in magnetite
Authors: J.O. Schunck, P.S. Miedema, R.Y. Engel, S. Dziarzhytski, G. Brenner, N. Ekanayake, C.-F. Chang, P. Bougiatioti, F. Döring, B. Rösner, C. David, C. Schüßler-Langeheine, M. Beye
Abstract: Pump-probe methods are a ubiquitous tool in the field of ultrafast dynamic measurements. In recent years, X-ray free-electron laser experiments have gained importance due to their ability to probe with high chemical selectivity and at atomic length scales. To obtain the complete dynamic information, measurements are typically repeated many thousands of times with varying delay and/or fluence settings. This generally necessitates that the sample fully recovers before the subsequent excitation and that probe pulses and the induced dynamic evolution are comparable to each other. These conditions present a significant challenge when the sample fluctuates between different initial states or when it is susceptible to damage. Also, source fluctuations are normally intrinsic to free-electron laser pulses. Here, we present a time-to-space mapping imaging scheme that enables us to record a delay range of several picoseconds as well as a laser fluence range of about one order of magnitude in every single shot of the x-ray probe. This approach can circumvent the aforementioned preconditions. We demonstrate the use of this scheme by mapping the femto- and picosecond dynamics of the optically induced insulator-to-metal Verwey transition in a magnetite thin film. We employ resonant diffraction at the free-electron laser FLASH for probing. The dynamics of the magnetite thin film are found to follow a biexponential decay in line with earlier studies on bulk crystals. By extrapolating our results towards the conditions found at X-ray free-electron lasers with higher energy, we demonstrate that the presented data could be recorded in a single shot.

Title: First-principles study of electronic and magnetic properties of self-intercalated van der Waals magnet Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$
Authors: Jia-wan Li, Shi-Bo Zhao, Lin Zhuang, Yusheng Hou
Abstract: Self-intercalated van der Waals magnets, characterized by self-intercalating native atoms into van der Waals layered structures with intrinsic magnetism, exhibit a variety of novel physical properties. Here, using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we report a self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet, Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, which has a high Curie temperature of 492 K. We find that Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ is nearly half-metallic with a spin polarization reaching up to 90.9%. Due to the ferromagnetism and strong spin-orbit coupling effect in Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, a large anomalous Hall conductivity of 138 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ and 305 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ can be realized when its magnetization is along its magnetic easy axis and hard axis, respectively. By doping electrons (holes) into Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, these anomalous Hall conductivities can be increased up to 318 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ (648 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$). Interestingly, a 5-layer Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ thin film retains the room-temperature ferromagnetism with a higher spin polarization and larger anomalous Hall conductivity. Our work demonstrates that Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ is a novel room-temperature self-intercalated ferromagnet with high spin polarization and large anomalous Hall conductivity, offering great opportunities for designing nano-scale electronic devices.

Title: Three-dimensional deformations in single-layer $\alpha$ antimonene and interaction with a Au(111) surface from first principles
Authors: José de Jesús Villalobos Castro, Thomas Pierron, Stephane Pons, Johann Coraux, Lorenzo Sponza, Sergio Vlaic
Abstract: Using density functional theory, we investigate the electronic structure of the alpha phase of an antimony monolayer in its isolated form and in contact to the (111) surface of gold. We demonstrate that the isolated single-layer actually displays a slightly modulated puckering that stabilizes the monolayer, not a uniform one as often assumed. Moreover, it has dramatic consequences on the electronic band structure: the material is a semiconductor with low-dispersing bands near the Brillouin zone center. By further application of about 12% strain on the armchair direction, a double-cone features develops wherein an electronic bandgap of about 21~meV is found. When in contact with a Au(111) surface, a strong interaction with gold arises, as it appears clearly from (i) substantial atomic displacements compared to the isolated form, and (ii) hybridization of Sb and Au orbitals. The latter profoundly modifies the electronic band structure by strengthening the spin-orbit splitting of hybridized bands and spoiling the double-cone feature whose manipulation through substrate-induced strain appears therefore questionable, at least in the simulated epitaxial implementation.

Title: Dynamical response of noncollinear spin systems at constrained magnetic moments
Authors: Miquel Royo, Massimiliano Stengel
Abstract: Noncollinear magnets are notoriously difficult to describe within first-principles approaches based on density-functional theory (DFT) because of the presence of low-lying spin excitations. At the level of ground-state calculations, several methods exist to constrain the magnetic moments to a predetermined configuration, and thereby accelerate convergence towards self-consistency. Their use in a perturbative context, however, remains very limited. Here we present a general methodological framework to achieve parametric control over the local spin moments at the linear-response level. Our strategy builds on the concept of Legendre transform to switch between various flavors of magnetic functionals, and to relate their second derivatives via simple linear-algebra operations. Thereby, we can address an arbitrary response function at the time-dependent DFT level of theory with optimal accuracy and minimal computational effort. In the low frequency limit, we identify the leading correction to the existing adiabatic formulation of the problem [S. Ren \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. X {\bf 14}, 011041 (2024)], consisting in a renormalization of the phonon and magnon masses due to electron inertia. As a demonstration, we apply our methodology to the study of the THz optical response in bulk CrI$_3$, where we identify a hybrid electromagnon with mixed spin-lattice character.

Title: Exploring Unique Characteristics in Stark Many-Body Localization
Authors: Chung Po Ching, Xiao Li
Abstract: Stark Many-Body Localization (MBL) is a phenomenon observed in quantum systems in the absence of disorder, where the presence of a linear potential, known as the Stark field, causes the localization. Our study aims to provide novel insight into the properties of Stark MBL and to discover unique entanglement characteristics specific to this phenomenon. The phase diagram analysis reveals different behavior with varying interaction strengths. Furthermore, we highlight the influence of domain wall structures on the breakdown of the entanglement entropy of the system. Moreover, the investigation of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlator (OTOC) behavior demonstrates distinct responses to interactions based on domain wall configurations. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Stark MBL and offer valuable insights into the entanglement properties of systems subjected to Stark potentials.

Title: Absence of orbital current torque in Ta/ferromagnet bilayers
Authors: Qianbiao Liu, Lijun Zhu
Abstract: It has become a heated debate as to whether the orbital Hall effect of a material could generate a non-local orbital current and a non-zero spin-orbit torque on an adjacent magnetic layer. Here, we report unambiguous evidence that, regardless of the ferromagnets (FMs) (e.g., Ni, Ni81Fe19, Fe, Fe60Co20B20, and FePt), the spin-orbit torque generated by an adjacent Ta, which is predicted to have a 50 times greater positive orbital Hall conductivity than the negative spin Hall conductivity, has essentially the same, negative efficiency, in agreement with the spin Hall effect of Ta being the only source of the interfacial torque. We identify that the constant, positive estimate of the torque of the Ta/FM samples from spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) analysis in a specific FM thickness range (>2 nm for Ni), that was heavily cited in the literature to signify an orbital current torque but strongly disagrees with the fairly long relaxation length in other orbital current torque claims, results from the overlook of a significant thick-dependent self-induced ST-FMR signal of the FM. These results indicate the absence of orbital current torque in Ta/ferromagnet systems, regardless of the type, the SOC strength, and the layer thickness of the ferromagnets.

Title: Linear and Nonlinear Edelstein Effects in Chiral Topological Semimetals
Authors: Haowei Xu, Ju Li
Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in achieving on-demand control of magnetism through electrical and optical means. In this work, we provide first-principles predictions for the linear and nonlinear Edelstein effects (LEE and NLEE) in the chiral topological semimetal CoSi. The LEE and NLEE represent first- and second-order magnetic responses to external electric fields, enabling precise manipulation of magnetization via electrical and optical methods. We demonstrate that although both LEE and NLEE require time-reversal symmetry breaking, they can still be realized in non-magnetic materials, as time-reversal symmetry can be spontaneously broken by heat and dissipation, according to the second law of thermodynamics. Meanwhile, due to different inversion symmetry selection rules, the LEE and NLEE manifest opposite and identical signs in the two enantiomers of CoSi, respectively. We further quantify the magnitude of LEE and NLEE, showing that electrically or optically induced magnetization can reach 10 Bohr magneton per unit cell when the external electric field strength is comparable with the internal atomic electric field, which is on the order of 1 V/A. Our work offers a systematical approach for predicting the electrical and optical control of magnetism in real materials, paving the way for potential applications in areas such as spintronics and magnetic memories.

Title: Investigation of Polymer Association Behaviors in Solvents Using a Coarse-Grained Model
Authors: Xiangyu Zhang, Dong Meng
Abstract: The associative interaction, such as hydrogen bonding, can bring about versatile functionalities to polymer systems, which has been investigated by tremendous researches, but the fundamental understanding on association process is still lacking. In this study, a reaction-controlled association model is proposed to delve into the polymer association activities in solvents, which is proved to obey the principle of thermodynamics. Additionally, associative polymer chain configurational bias method is developed to improve sampling efficiency, demonstrating a significantly faster relaxation process. First, we set non-bonded interactions to be zero, and only keep the chain connectivity and association. It is found that the association process intrinsically follows Bernoulli process by comparing the simulation results and analytic results. Next, we include non-bonded interactions into the simulation to examine its effects. It emerged that the excluded volume effect and solvents immiscibility effects can result in inhomogeneous associating probability distribution along the chain contour, in contrast to the homogeneity observed in ideal systems, thereby shifting from the binomial distribution to Poisson binomial distribution. At last, the study is extended to cooperative association systems. The incorporation of cooperative association can lead to the coexistence of coil and globule state at the transition point, verified by the potential of mean force calculation. Finally, a mathematical model is proposed, illustrating the changes in statistical weight induced by sequence enthalpy bias, which is the consequence of cooperative behaviors.

Title: Beyond-Hubbard pairing in a cuprate ladder

Abstract: The Hubbard model is believed to capture the essential physics of cuprate superconductors. However, recent theoretical studies suggest that it fails to reproduce a robust and homogeneous superconducting ground state. Here, using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering and density matrix renormalization group calculations, we show that magnetic excitations in the prototypical cuprate ladder Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ are inconsistent with those of a simple Hubbard model. The magnetic response of hole carriers, contributing to an emergent branch of spin excitations, is strongly suppressed. This effect is the consequence of d-wave-like pairing, enhanced by nearly an order of magnitude through a large nearest-neighbor attractive interaction. The similarity between cuprate ladders and the two-dimensional compounds suggests that such an enhanced hole pairing may be a universal feature of superconducting cuprates.

Title: Intense Laser-Driven Phenomena In Weyl Semimetals
Authors: Amar Bharti
Abstract: Condensed-matter provides attractive platforms to realize exotic particles, originally proposed in high-energy physics. Weyl semimetal (WSM) is a material in which low-energy collective excitations are governed by massless Weyl fermions, which appear in pairs of opposite chirality and are topologically protected. Thus, the discovery of topological materials such as WSM has heralded a new era in contemporary physics. Moreover, these materials offer exciting opportunities in next-generation signal processing and optoelectronics. This thesis explores different facets of the intense laser-driven phenomena in WSM for applications in emerging lightwave-driven Petahertz electronics and quantum technologies.

Title: Cooper-Pair Localization in the Magnetic Dynamics of a Cuprate Ladder

Abstract: We investigate the spin dynamics of the cuprate ladder Sr$_{2.5}$Ca$_{11.5}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ to elucidate the behavior of its intrinsically doped holes. Combining high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and density matrix renormalization group calculations enables a comprehensive analysis of the collective magnetic dynamics. We find a general absence of magnetic signatures from unpaired charges, indicating holes within the system form strongly bound localized Cooper pairs. A one-band Hubbard model fails to match the spectral features but a straightforward extension to a large attractive nearest-neighbor interaction quantitatively explains our results. Our finding shows the significance of additional interactions beyond the long-predicted quantum spin pairing in the ($d$-wave) charge pairing process. Considering the parallels between ladders and two-dimensional cuprates, these results are potentially relevant for square lattices as well.

Title: Static Born charges and quantum capacitance in metals and doped semiconductors
Authors: Asier Zabalo, Cyrus E. Dreyer, Massimiliano Stengel
Abstract: Born dynamical charges ($\textbf{Z}^\text{dyn}$) play a key role in the lattice dynamics of most crystals, including both insulators and metals in the nonadiabatic ("clean") regime. Very recently, the so-called static Born charges, $\textbf{Z}^\text{stat}$, were introduced [G. Marchese, et al., Nat. Phys. $\mathbf{20}$, 88 (2024)] as a means to modeling the long-wavelength behavior of polar phonons in overdamped ("dirty") metals. Here we present a method to calculate $\textbf{Z}^\text{stat}$ directly at the zone center, by applying the $2n+1$ theorem to the long-wavelength expansion of the charge response to a phonon. Furthermore, we relate $\textbf{Z}^\text{stat}$ to the charge response to a uniform strain perturbation via an exact sum rule, where the quantum capacitance of the material plays a crucial role. We showcase our findings via extensive numerical tests on simple metals aluminum and copper, polar metal LiOsO$_3$, and doped semiconductor SrTiO$_3$. Based on our results, we critically discuss the physical significance of $\textbf{Z}^\text{stat}$ in light of their dependence on the choice of the electrostatic reference, and on the length scale that is assumed in the definition of the macroscopic potentials.

Title: Magnetic properties of the zigzag ladder compound SrTb2O4

Abstract: We report on the properties of SrTb2O4, a frustrated zigzag ladder antiferromagnet, studied by single crystal neutron diffraction (with polarised neutrons in zero field and unpolarised neutrons in an applied magnetic field), as well as by neutron spectroscopy on a polycrystalline sample. The neutron scattering results are supported by single crystal magnetisation and heat capacity measurements. In zero field, neutron diffraction data show no transition to a magnetically ordered state down to the lowest experimentally available temperature of 35 mK, and the material remains magnetically disordered down to this temperature. Polarised neutron diffraction measurements reveal the presence of a diffuse scattering signal suggesting only very weak spin-spin correlations in the ground state. For H // c (the easy magnetisation direction), we followed the magnetisation process using neutron diffraction measurements and observed the appearance of field-induced magnetic Bragg peaks with integer h and k indices in the (hk0) scattering plane. No magnetic peaks with a non-zero propagation vector were detected. The observed in-field data fit well to a simple two-sublattice model with magnetic moments aligned along the field direction but being significantly different in magnitude for the two inequivalent Tb3+ sites in the unit cell. Overall, the collected data point to a nonmagnetic ground state in SrTb2O4 despite the presence of strong interactions.

Title: Hopper flows of dense suspensions: a 2D microfluidic model system
Authors: Lars Kool, Jules Tampier, Philippe Bourrianne, Anke Lindner
Abstract: Flows of particles through bottlenecks are ubiquitous in nature and industry, involving both dry granular materials and suspensions. However, practical limitations of conventional experimental setups hinder the full understanding of these flows in confined geometries. Here, we present a microfluidic setup to investigate experimentally the flow of dense suspensions in a two-dimensional hopper channel. Particles with controlled properties are in-situ fabricated with a photolithographic projection method and compacted at the channel constriction using a Quake valve. The setup is characterized by examining the flow of a dense suspension of hard, monodisperse disks through constrictions of varying widths. We demonstrate that the microfluidic hopper discharges particles at constant rate, resulting from the channel resistance being dominated by the presence of densely packed particles within the tapered section of the hopper. Under imposed flow rate the discharge remains independent of particle and orifice sizes, whereas it exhibits a Beverloo-like scaling under pressure-imposed conditions. Additionally, we show that the statistics of clog formation in our microfluidic hopper follow the same stochastic laws as reported in other systems. Finally, we show how the versatility of our microfluidic model system can be used to investigate the outflow and clogging of suspensions of more complex particles.

Title: From strong to weak correlations in breathing-mode kagome van der Waals materials: Nb$_3$(F,Cl,Br,I)$_8$ as a robust and versatile platform for many-body engineering
Authors: Joost Aretz, Sergii Grytsiuk, Xiaojing Liu, Giovanna Feraco, Chrystalla Knekna, Muhammad Waseem, Zhiying Dan, Marco Bianchi, Philip Hofmann, Mazhar N. Ali, Mikhail I. Katsnelson, Antonija Grubišić-Čabo, Hugo U. R. Strand, Erik G. C. P. van Loon, Malte Rösner
Abstract: By combining ab initio downfolding with cluster dynamical mean-field theory, we study the degree of correlations in the low-temperature structures of the breathing-mode kagome van der Waals materials Nb$_3$(F,Cl,Br,I)$_8$. We show that the Coulomb correlation strength steadily increases from I to Br, Cl, and F, allowing us to identify Nb$_3$I$_8$ as a weakly correlated (obstructed atomic) insulator whose gap is only mildly affected by the local Coulomb interaction. Nb$_3$Br$_8$ and Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ are strongly correlated insulators, whose gaps are significantly influenced by Coulomb-induced vertex corrections. Nb$_3$F$_8$ is a prototypical bulk Mott-insulator whose gap is initially opened by strong correlation effects. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements comparing Nb$_3$Br$_8$ and Nb$_3$I$_8$ allow us to experimentally confirm these findings by revealing spectroscopic footprints of the degree of correlation. Our calculations further predict that the entire material family can be tuned into correlated charge-transfer or Mott-insulating phases upon electron or hole doping. Our magnetic property analysis additionally shows that inter-layer magnetic frustrations in the high-temperature phase drive the lattice phase transition to the low-temperature structures. The accompanying bilayer hybridization through inter-layer dimerization yields magnetic singlet ground states in the Cl, Br, and I compounds. Our findings establish Nb$_3$X$_8$ as a robust, versatile, and tunable class for van der Waals-based Coulomb and Mott engineering and allow us to speculate on the symmetry-breaking effects necessary for the recently observed Josephson diode effect in NbSe$_2$/Nb$_3$Br$_8$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures.

Title: Principled model selection for stochastic dynamics
Authors: Andonis Gerardos, Pierre Ronceray
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems, from macromolecules to ecosystems, are often modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). To learn such models from data, a common approach involves decomposing the SDE into a linear combination of basis functions. However, this can induce overfitting due to the proliferation of parameters. To address this, we introduce Parsimonious Stochastic Inference (PASTIS), a principled method that removes superfluous parameters from SDE models by combining likelihood-estimation statistics with extreme value theory. We benchmark it against existing methods and show that it reliably selects the exact minimal models from large libraries of functions, even with a low sampling rate or measurement error. We show that it extends to stochastic partial differential equations and demonstrate applications to the inference of ecological networks and reaction-diffusion dynamics.

Title: Photonic chiral state transfer near the Liouvillian exceptional point
Authors: Huixia Gao, Konghao Sun, Dengke Qu, Kunkun Wang, Lei Xiao, Wei Yi, Peng Xue
Abstract: As branch-point singularities of non-Hermitian matrices, the exceptional points (EPs) exhibit unique spectral topology and criticality, with intriguing dynamic consequences in non-Hermitian settings. In open quantum systems, EPs also emerge in the Liouvillian spectrum, but their dynamic impact often pertains to the transient dynamics and is challenging to demonstrate. Here, using the flexible control afforded by single-photon interferometry, we study the chiral state transfer when the Liouvillian EP is parametrically encircled. Reconstructing the density-matrix evolution by experimentally simulating the quantum Langevin equation, we show that the chirality of the dynamics is only present within an intermediate encircling timescale and dictated by the landscape of the Liouvillian spectrum near the EP. However, the chirality disappears at long times as the system always relaxes to the steady state. We then demonstrate the universal scaling of the chirality with respect to the encircling time. Our experiment confirms the transient nature of chiral state transfer near a Liouvillian EP in open quantum systems, while our scheme paves the way for simulating general open-system dynamics using single photons.

Title: Information geometry of transitions between quantum nonequilibrium steady states
Authors: Artur M. Lacerda, Laetitia P. Bettmann, John Goold
Abstract: In a transition between nonequilibrium steady states, the entropic cost associated with the maintenance of steady-state currents can be distinguished from that arising from the transition itself through the concepts of excess/housekeeping entropy flux and adiabatic/nonadiabatic entropy production. The thermodynamics of this transition is embodied by the Hatano-Sasa relation. In this letter, we show that for a slow transition between quantum nonequilibrium steady states the nonadiabatic entropy production is, to leading order, given by the path action with respect to a Riemannian metric in the parameter space which can be connected to the Kubo-Mori-Bogoliubov quantum Fisher information. We then demonstrate how to obtain minimally dissipative paths by solving the associated geodesic equation and illustrate the procedure with a simple example of a three-level maser. Furthermore, by identifying the quantum Fisher information with respect to time as a metric in state space, we derive an upper bound on the excess entropy flux that holds for arbitrarily fast processes.

Title: Gold nanocone array with wide angles and high absorptivity for light absorber
Authors: Xu Jiawei, Huang Ran, Tao Lei, Zhang Jiaming, Wu Xuanxuan, Yang Pengchong, Lyu Shuangbao, Duan Jinglai
Abstract: The gold nanocone array, fabricated with the ion track method, exhibits exceptionally high light absorptivity, making it a wide angle light absorber. The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method was employed to study the influence of the geometric parameters on total absorptivity and promote strategies to enhance the absorptivity of the gold nanocone array. Experimental measurements were concluded to assess the total absorption and bidirectional reflection distribution function (BRDF) properties of the gold nanocone array. The absorptivity measurement results demonstrate that the gold nanocone array exhibits a wide angle (5-75°) of incidence and high absorptivity properties, achieving an absorptivity over 0.98. The BRDF results show that the reflection of the gold nanocone array is predominantly attributed to non-specular reflections, and exhibits excellent Lambert properties. This study reveals the influence of structural parameters and light incidence angle on the absorptivity of the gold nanocone array, which plays an important role in further understanding the light absorption/reflection mechanism and enhancing the absorptivity.

Title: Generation of entanglement and non-stationary states via competing coherent and incoherent bosonic hopping
Authors: Parvinder Solanki, Albert Cabot, Matteo Brunelli, Federico Carollo, Christoph Bruder, Igor Lesanovsky
Abstract: Incoherent stochastic processes added to unitary dynamics are typically deemed detrimental since they are expected to diminish quantum features such as superposition and entanglement. Instead of exhibiting energy-conserving persistent coherent motion, the dynamics of such open systems feature, in most cases, a steady state, which is approached in the long-time limit from all initial conditions. This can, in fact, be advantageous as it offers a mechanism for the creation of robust quantum correlations on demand without the need for fine-tuning. Here, we show this for a system consisting of two coherently coupled bosonic modes, which is a paradigmatic scenario for the realization of quantum resources such as squeezed entangled states. Rather counterintuitively, the mere addition of incoherent hopping, which results in a statistical coupling between the bosonic modes, leads to steady states with robust quantum entanglement and enables the emergence of persistent coherent non-stationary behavior.

Title: A relativistic continuous matrix product state study of field theories with defects
Authors: Karan Tiwana, Edoardo Lauria, Antoine Tilloy
Abstract: We propose a method to compute expectation values in 1+1-dimensional massive Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) with line defects using Relativistic Continuous Matrix Product State (RCMPS). Exploiting Euclidean invariance, we use a quantization scheme where (imaginary) time runs perpendicularly to the defect. With this choice, correlation functions of local operators in the presence of the defect can be computed as expectation values of extended operators in the no-defect vacuum, which can be approximated by a homogeneous RCMPS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this machinery by computing correlation functions of local bulk and defect operators in $\phi^4$ theory with a magnetic line defect, in perturbative, strong coupling, critical, and symmetry-broken regimes.

Authors: Alasdair I. Fletcher, Cillian Harney, Masoud Ghalaii, Panagiotis Papanastasiou, Alexandros Mountogiannakis, Gaetana Spedalieri, Adnan A. E. Hajomer, Tobias Gehring, Stefano Pirandola
Abstract: As quantum key distribution (QKD) emerges as a robust defense against quantum computer threats, significant advancements have been realized by researchers. A pivotal focus has been the development of protocols that not only simplify hardware implementation like the use of continuous-variable (CV) systems, but also negate the necessity for trusted nodes, as seen with the measurement-device independent (MDI) approach. This paper delves into the integration of these methodologies in the CV-MDI-QKD protocol, offering an in-depth exploration of its evolution, primary characteristics, and the latest advancements in both theory and experiment.

Title: Motorized Chromosome Models of Mitosis
Authors: Zhiyu Cao, Chaoqun Du, Zhonghuai Hou, Peter G. Wolynes
Abstract: During mitosis, near-spherical chromosomes reconfigure into rod-like structures to ensure their accurate segregation to daughter cells. We explore here, the interplay between the nonequilibrium activity of molecular motors in determining the chromosomal organization in mitosis and its characteristic symmetry-breaking events. We present a hybrid motorized chromosome model that highlights the distinct roles of condensin I and II in shaping mitotic chromosomes. Guided by experimental observations, the simulations suggest that condensin II facilitates large-scale scaffold formation, while condensin I is paramount in local helical loop arrangement. Together, these two distinct grappling motors establish the hierarchical helical structure characteristic of mitotic chromosomes, which exhibit striking local and, sometimes global, chirality and contribute to the robust mechanical properties of mitotic chromosomes. Accompanying the emergence of rigidity, the model provides mechanisms of forming defects, including perversions and entanglements, and shows how these may be partially resolved through condensin activity and topoisomerase action. This framework bridges coarse-grained energy landscape models of chromosome dynamics and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics, advancing the understanding of chromosome organization during cell division and beyond.

Title: Low-Loss Superconducting Resonators Fabricated from Tantalum Films Grown at Room Temperature

Abstract: The use of $\alpha$-tantalum in superconducting circuits has enabled a considerable improvement of the coherence time of transmon qubits. The standard approach to grow $\alpha$-tantalum thin films on silicon involves heating the substrate, which takes several hours per deposition and prevents the integration of this material with wafers containing temperature-sensitive components. We report a detailed experimental study of an alternative growth method of $\alpha$-tantalum on silicon, which is achieved at room temperature through the use of a niobium seed layer. Despite a substantially higher density of oxygen-rich grain boundaries in the films sputtered at room temperature, resonators made from these films are found to have state-of-the-art quality factors, comparable to resonators fabricated from tantalum grown at high temperature. This finding challenges previous assumptions about correlations between material properties and microwave loss of superconducting thin films, and opens a new avenue for the integration of tantalum into fabrication flows with limited thermal budget.

Title: A rigid origami elliptic-hyperbolic vertex duality
Authors: Thomas C. Hull
Abstract: The field of rigid origami concerns the folding of stiff, inelastic plates of material along crease lines that act like hinges and form a straight-line planar graph, called the crease pattern of the origami. Crease pattern vertices in the interior of the folded material and that are adjacent to four crease lines, i.e. degree-4 vertices, have a single degree of freedom and can be chained together to make flexible polyhedral surfaces. Degree-4 vertices that can fold to a completely flat state have folding kinematics that are very well-understood, and thus they have been used in many engineering and physics applications. However, degree-4 vertices that are not flat-foldable or not folded from flat paper so that the vertex forms either an elliptic or hyperbolic cone, have folding angles at the creases that follow more complicated kinematic equations. In this work we present a new duality between general degree-4 rigid origami vertices, where dual vertices come in elliptic-hyperbolic pairs that have essentially equivalent kinematics. This reveals a mathematical structure in the space of degree-4 rigid origami vertices that can be leveraged in applications, for example in the construction of flexible 3D structures that possess metamaterial properties.

Title: Non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm Cage in Bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Systems
Authors: Kunling Zhou, Bowen Zeng, Yong Hu
Abstract: The non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage is a unique localization phenomenon that confines all possible excitations. This confinement leads to fully flat spectrum in momentum space, which are typically accompanied with the degeneracy with various types. Classifying the degeneracy type is crucial for studying the dynamical properties of the non-Hermitian AB cage, but the methods for such classification and their physical connections remain not very clear. Here, we construct a non-Hermitian AB cage in a bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) system with various type of degenerate flat bands (DFBs). Using the transfer matrix, we demonstrate the localization mechanism for the formation of AB cage and derive the minimal polynomial in mathematics for classifying the degeneracy types of DFBs, thus providing comprehensive understanding of the correspondence among the degeneracy type of DFBs, the minimal polynomial, and the transfer matrix. With such correspondence, we propose a scheme to realize highly degenerate flat bands.

Title: Microwave scattering by rough polyhedral particles on a surface
Authors: Anne Virkki, Maxim Yurkin
Abstract: The electromagnetic (EM) scattering by non-symmetric wavelength-scale particles on a planar surface has numerous applications in the remote sensing of planetary bodies, both in planetary and geo-sciences. We conduct numerical simulations of EM scattering by rough polyhedral particles (with 12 or 20 faces) using the discrete-dipole approximation and contrast the results to that of spheres. The particles have permittivities corresponding to common minerals in the microwave regime ($\epsilon_r=4.7 + 0.016$i and $7.8 + 0.09$i), and a size-frequency distribution (SFD) consistent with the observed scattering properties (power law distribution of size parameters between 0.5 and 8 with an index from $-2.5$ to $-3.5$). The assumed substrate permittivity $2.4 + 0.012$i corresponds to a powdered regolith. We present what roles the particle roundness, permittivity, and SFD for a realistic range of parameters play in the EM scattering properties as a function of incidence angle with a focus on backscattering in microwave-remote-sensing applications. The particle roundness and SFD have a clearly observable effect on the polarimetric properties, while the role of permittivity is relatively minor (in the studied range). Among various backscattering observables, the circular polarization ratio is the least sensitive to the decrease of the upper boundary (down to a size parameter of 3) and the index of the SFD.

Title: Surrogate-based multiscale analysis of experiments on thermoplastic composites under off-axis loading
Authors: M. A. Maia, I. B. C. M. Rocha, D. Kovačević, F. P. van der Meer
Abstract: In this paper, we present a surrogate-based multiscale approach to model constant strain-rate and creep experiments on unidirectional thermoplastic composites under off-axis loading. In previous contributions, these experiments were modeled through a single-scale micromechanical simulation under the assumption of macroscopic homogeneity. Although efficient and accurate in many scenarios, simulations with low-off axis angles showed significant discrepancies with the experiments. It was hypothesized that the mismatch was caused by macroscopic inhomogeneity, which would require a multiscale approach to capture it. However, full-field multiscale simulations remain computationally prohibitive. To address this issue, we replace the micromodel with a Physically Recurrent Neural Network (PRNN), a surrogate model that combines data-driven components with embedded constitutive models to capture history-dependent behavior naturally. The explainability of the latent space of this network is also explored in a transfer learning strategy that requires no re-training. With the surrogate-based simulations, we confirm the hypothesis raised on the inhomogeneity of the macroscopic strain field and gain insights into the influence of adjustment of the experimental setup with oblique end-tabs. Results from the surrogate-based multiscale approach show better agreement with experiments than the single-scale micromechanical approach over a wide range of settings, although with limited accuracy on the creep experiments, where macroscopic test effects were implicitly taken into account in the material properties calibration.

Title: Binary superfluids: low-energy properties and dissipative processes from spontaneous emission of massive phonons
Authors: Silvia Trabucco, Luca Lepori, Maria Luisa Chiofalo, Massimo Mannarelli
Abstract: We discuss the low-energy properties of binary superfluids with density-dependent interactions. Adding an intra-species coupling that induces an explicit soft symmetry-breaking, we determine the background pressure and we show that the low-energy spectrum consists of a massless Nambu- Goldstone boson and a massive (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson. When the background velocities of the two superfluids are transonic, the system is characterized by two distinct acoustic horizons: the hydrodynamic analogue of the black hole event horizon. The Hawking-like emission occurring at these horizons produces an effective friction on the fluids. We compute the viscosity-to-entropy ratios close to the two acoustic horizons, finding that the emission of pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons violates the bound conjectured by Kovtun, Son and Starinet.

Title: Mosaic-skeleton approximation is all you need for Smoluchowski equations
Authors: Roman R. Dyachenko, Sergey A. Matveev, Bulat I. Valiakhmetov
Abstract: In this work we demonstrate a surprising way of exploitation of the mosaic--skeleton approximations for efficient numerical solving of aggregation equations with many applied kinetic kernels. The complexity of the evaluation of the right-hand side with $M$ nonlinear differential equations basing on the use of the mosaic-skeleton approximations is $\mathcal{O}(M \log^2 M)$ operations instead of $\mathcal{O}(M^2)$ for the straightforward computation. The class of kernels allowing to make fast and accurate computations via our approach is wider than analogous set of kinetic coefficients for effective calculations with previously developed algorithms. This class covers the aggregation problems arising in modelling of sedimentation, supersonic effects, turbulent flows, etc. We show that our approach makes it possible to study the systems with $M=2^{20}$ nonlinear equations within a modest computing time.

Title: Beyond the Cassie-Baxter Model: New Insights for Predicting Imbibition in Complex Systems
Authors: Mathis Fricke, Lisanne Gossel, Joel De Coninck
Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of liquid imbibition in a single pore with spatially varying wettability. Starting from the Lucas-Washburn equation, we derive analytical solutions for the imbibition time (crossing time) in systems where wettability alternates between two materials. For ordered arrangements, we demonstrate that the imbibition speed depends non-trivially on the spatial distribution, with the "more hydrophobic-first" configuration being optimal. For disordered systems, where segment lengths follow a Gaussian distribution, we show that the classical Cassie-Baxter contact angle, originally derived for static wetting, fails to predict the dynamics of capillary-driven flow. To address this, we propose a new weighted harmonic averaging method for the contact angle, which accurately describes the viscous crossing time in such heterogeneous systems. Our findings reveal fundamental insights into the role of wettability heterogeneity in capillary-driven flow, offering a basis for understanding imbibition dynamics in complex heterogeneous systems. The research data and the software supporting this study are openly available at DOI:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14537452.

Title: Orthogonal projections of hypercubes
Authors: Yoshiaki Horiike, Shin Fujishiro
Abstract: Projections of hypercubes have been applied for visualizing high-dimensional binary state spaces in various fields of sciences. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization methods impose limitations on the interpretation and reproducibility of the resulting plots. Here, we propose using principal component analysis (PCA) for projecting hypercubes, which offers an automated, interpretable, and reproducible solution. We reveal analytically and numerically that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions in the state space. The resulting distribution of projected vertices is shown to be asymptotically the standard Gaussian, a characteristic of high-dimensional orthogonal projections. This method is applied to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems, where the biplots reveal the pathways involving correlated spin flips. Our work demonstrates the potential of PCA for discovering hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.

Title: Fault-tolerant quantum simulation of generalized Hubbard models
Authors: Andreas Juul Bay-Smidt, Frederik Ravn Klausen, Christoph Sünderhauf, Róbert Izsák, Gemma C. Solomon, Nick S. Blunt
Abstract: Quantum simulations of strongly interacting fermionic systems, such as those described by the Hubbard model, are promising candidates for useful early fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which allows simulation of Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices and provides a framework that enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model and the PPP model. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate Hubbard models on hexagonal lattice fragments and periodic hexagonal lattices, analyze gate costs, and provide commutator bounds for evaluating Trotter errors, including new commutator bounds for the extended Hubbard model. We compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, which we optimize for the hexagonal lattice Hubbard model, and demonstrate that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.

Title: Diffraction of Light from Optical Fourier Surfaces
Authors: Yannik M. Glauser, J. J. Erik Maris, Raphael Brechbühler, Juri G. Crimmann, Valentina G. De Rosa, Daniel Petter, Gabriel Nagamine, Nolan Lassaline, David J. Norris
Abstract: Diffractive surfaces shape optical wavefronts for applications in spectroscopy, high-speed communication, and imaging. The performance of these structures is primarily determined by how precisely they can be patterned. Fabrication constraints commonly lead to square-shaped, "binary" profiles that contain unwanted spatial frequencies that contaminate the diffraction. Recently, "wavy" surfaces (known as optical Fourier surfaces, OFSs) have been introduced that include only the desired spatial frequencies. However, the optical performance and reliability of these structures have not yet been experimentally tested with respect to models and simulations. Such a quantitative investigation could also provide previously unobtainable information about the diffraction process from the most fundamental diffractive surfaces$\unicode{x2014}$sinusoidally pure profiles. Here, we produce and study two classes of reflective OFSs: (i) single-sinusoidal profiles of varying depth and (ii) double-sinusoidal profiles with varying relative phase. After refining our fabrication procedure to obtain larger and deeper OFSs at higher yields, we find that the measured optical responses from our OFSs agree quantitatively with full electrodynamic simulations. In contrast, our measurements diverge from analytical scalar diffraction models routinely used by researchers to describe diffraction. Overall, our results confirm that OFSs provide a precise and powerful platform for Fourier-spectrum engineering, satisfying the growing demand for intricately patterned interfaces for applications in holography, augmented reality, and optical computing.

Title: The dominant mechanisms for the formation of solute-rich clusters in low-Cu steels under irradiation
Authors: N. Castin, G. Bonny, A. Bakaev, F. Bergner, C. Domain, J.M. Hyde, L. Messina, B. Radiguet, L. Malerba
Abstract: The formation of nano-sized, coherent, solute-rich clusters (NSRC) is known to be an important factor causing the degradation of the macroscopic properties of steels under irradiation. The mechanisms driving their formation are still debated. This work focuses on low-Cu reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels, where solute species are generally not expected to precipitate. We rationalize the processes that take place at the nanometre scale under irradiation, relying on the latest theoretical and experimental evidence on atomic-level diffusion and transport processes. These are compiled in a new model, based on the object kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) technique. We evaluate the relevance of the underlying physical assumptions by applying the model to a large variety of irradiation experiments. Our model predictions are compared with new experimental data obtained with atom probe tomography and small angle neutron scattering, complemented with information from the literature. The results of this study reveal that the role of immobilized self-interstitial atoms (SIA) loops dominates the nucleation process of NSRC.

Title: Theory of Kinetically-Constrained-Models Dynamics
Authors: Gianmarco Perrupato, Tommaso Rizzo
Abstract: The mean-field theory of Kinetically-Constrained-Models is developed by considering the Fredrickson-Andersen model on the Bethe lattice. Using certain properties of the dynamics observed in actual numerical experiments we derive asymptotic dynamical equations equal to those of Mode-Coupling-Theory. Analytical predictions obtained for the dynamical exponents are successfully compared with numerical simulations in a wide range of models, including the case of generic values of the connectivity and the facilitation, random pinning and fluctuating facilitation. The theory is thus validated for both continuous and discontinuous transitions and also in the case of higher order critical points characterized by logarithmic decays.

Title: Defect bound states in the continuum of bilayer electronic materials without symmetry protection
Authors: Daniel Massatt, Stephen P. Shipman, Ilya Vekhter, Justin H. Wilson
Abstract: We analyze a class of bound defect states in the continuum electronic spectrum of bilayer materials, which emerge independent of symmetry protection or additional degrees of freedom. Taking graphene as a prototypical example, our comparative analysis of AA- and AB-stacked bilayer graphene demonstrates that these states originate from the intrinsic algebraic structure of the tight-binding Hamiltonian when trigonal warping is neglected rather than any underlying symmetry. Inclusion of trigonal warping and higher-order hoppings broaden the bound states into long-lived resonances. This discovery provides a pathway to previously unexplored approaches in defect and band-structure engineering. We conclude with a proposed protocol for observing these states in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.

Title: Self-Assembled Chains and Solids of Dipolar Atoms in a Multilayer
Authors: G. Guijarro, G. E. Astrakharchik, G. Morigi, J. Boronat
Abstract: We predict that ultracold bosonic dipolar gases, confined within a multilayer geometry, may undergo self-assembling processes, leading to the formation of chain gases and solids. These dipolar chains, with dipoles aligned across different layers, emerge at low densities and resemble phases observed in liquid crystals, such as nematic and smectic phases. We calculate the phase diagram using quantum Monte Carlo methods, introducing a newly devised trial wave function designed for describing the chain gas, where dipoles from different layers form chains without in-plane long-range order. We find gas, solid, and chain phases, along with quantum phase transitions between these states. Specifically, we predict the existence of quantum phase transitions from gaseous to self-ordered phases, as the interlayer distance is decreased. Remarkably, in the self-organized phases, the mean interparticle distance can significantly exceed the characteristic length of the interaction potential, yielding solids and chain gases with densities several orders of magnitude lower than those of conventional quantum solids.

Title: Path-Integral Formulation of Truncated Wigner Approximation for Bosonic Markovian Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Toma Yoneya, Kazuya Fujimoto, Yuki Kawaguchi
Abstract: The truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) enables us to investigate bosonic quantum many-body dynamics, including open quantum systems described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. In the TWA, the Weyl-Wigner transformation, a way of mapping from quantum-mechanical operators to $c$-numbers, of the GKSL equation leads to the Fokker-Planck equation, which we calculate by reducing it to the corresponding stochastic differential equations. However, the Fokker-Planck equation is not always reduced to the stochastic differential equations depending on details of jump operators. In this work, we clarify the condition for obtaining the stochastic differential equations from the Fokker-Planck equation and derive analytical expressions of these equations for a system with an arbitrary Hamiltonian with jump operators that do not couple different states. This result enables us to shortcut the conventional complicated calculations in applying the TWA. In the course of the derivation, we formulate the GKSL equation by using the path-integral representation based on the Weyl-Wigner transformation, which gives us a clear interpretation of the relation between the TWA and quantum fluctuations and allows us to calculate the non-equal time correlation functions in the TWA. In the benchmark calculations, we numerically confirm that the relaxation dynamics of physical quantities including the non-equal time correlation functions obtained in our formulation agrees well with the exact ones in the numerically solvable models.

Title: Critical Filaments and Superconductivity in Quasiperiodic Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Xinghai Zhang, Justin H. Wilson, Matthew S. Foster
Abstract: Multilayer moiré materials can exhibit topological electronic features yet are inherently quasiperiodic -- leading to wave function interference whose Anderson-localizing tendency can be mitigated by topology. We consider a quasiperiodic variant of the chiral Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene with two incommensurate moiré potentials that serves as a toy model for twisted trilayer. We observe "filaments" linking magic angles with enhanced density of states and fractal wave functions that evade localization; states away from the filaments mimic fractal surface states of dirty topological superconductors. We demonstrate that topological quasiperiodicity can broadly enhance superconductivity without magic-angle fine-tuning.

Title: Gauging modulated symmetries: Kramers-Wannier dualities and non-invertible reflections
Authors: Salvatore D. Pace, Guilherme Delfino, Ho Tat Lam, Ömer M. Aksoy
Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries that act in a non-uniform, spatially modulated way and are generalizations of, for example, dipole symmetries. In this paper, we systematically study the gauging of finite Abelian modulated symmetries in ${1+1}$ dimensions. Working with local Hamiltonians of spin chains, we explore the dual symmetries after gauging and their potential new spatial modulations. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of an isomorphism between the modulated symmetries and their dual, naturally implemented by lattice reflections. For instance, in systems of prime qudits, translation invariance guarantees this isomorphism. For non-prime qudits, we show using techniques from ring theory that this isomorphism can also exist, although it is not guaranteed by lattice translation symmetry alone. From this isomorphism, we identify new Kramers-Wannier dualities and construct related non-invertible reflection symmetry operators using sequential quantum circuits. Notably, this non-invertible reflection symmetry exists even when the system lacks ordinary reflection symmetry. Throughout the paper, we illustrate these results using various simple toy models.

Title: Entropy as Noether charge for quasistatic gradient flow
Authors: Aaron Beyen, Christian Maes
Abstract: Entropy increase is fundamentally related to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. By adding the 'extra dimension' associated with thermodynamic forces, we extend that discrete symmetry to a continuous symmetry for the dynamical fluctuations around (nonlinear) gradient flow. The latter connects macroscopic equilibrium conditions upon introducing a quasistatic protocol of control parameters. The entropy state function becomes the Noether charge. As a result, and following ideas expressed by Shin-ichi Sasa and co-workers, the adiabatic invariance of the entropy, part of the Clausius heat theorem, gets connected with the Noether theorem.

Title: Exact eigenstates with off-diagonal long-range order for interacting bosonic systems
Authors: C.H.Zhang, Z.Song
Abstract: Fermions and hardcore bosons share the same restriction: no more than one particle can occupy a single site in a lattice system. Specifically, in one dimension, two systems can share the same matrix representation. In this work, we investigate both the fermion and hardcore-boson models with nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction in a ring lattice. We construct the exact eigenstates of the hardcore-boson model with resonant NN interaction and show that they possess off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic limit. In comparison, the fermionic counterpart does not support such a feature due to the different particle statistics, although they share an identical energy spectrum. In addition, we examine the effect of the periodic boundary condition on the dynamics of the condensate states through numerical simulations.

Title: p-wave superconductivity induced by nearest-neighbor attraction in the square-lattice extended Hubbard model
Authors: Zhangkai Cao, Jianyu Li, Jiahao Su, Tao Ying, Ho-Kin Tang
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model is widely believed to contain the key ingredients of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials. Here, we report a constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) study of the square-lattice extended Hubbard model with on-site Coulomb repulsion U and nearest-neighbor (NN) electron attraction V. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.125, we find that the NN electron attraction V can notably drive an exotic spin-triplet (p-wave) superconducting (SC) phase, and enhance the p-wave SC correlations with the increase of V. But in the intermediate coupling regime, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave (d-wave) does not significantly increase with the increase of V, indicating that the d-wave is not affected by V in strongly correlated system. Besides the pairing phase, a spin density wave (SDW) only exists near the half-filling in the particle-hole channel, and doping disrupts the formation of SDW order. Especially, the NN electron attraction V has no significant effect on SDW, reflecting the consistent relationship between d-wave SC and spin correlation. Moreover, as doping increases, the dominant region of p-wave also expands, further suppressing the presence of d-wave, which may help explain the disappearance of d-wave SC in overdoped cuprate superconductors. We also find the d-wave exhibits a singular nonzero (near point ($2{\pi}/3, {\pi}$)) condensation structure in momentum space, resulting in a different staggered behavior in the x and y direction with distance in real space. On the contrary, the p-wave condensed at zero momentum, and the p-wave correlation exhibits exponential decay in real space. Our work suggests the p-wave SC region can be induced and further broadened by the NN electron attraction V, offering a feasible mechanism to realize p-wave superconductivity in realistic cuprate materials.

Title: The fate of poor man's Majoranas in the long Kitaev chain limit
Authors: Melina Luethi, Henry F. Legg, Daniel Loss, Jelena Klinovaja
Abstract: A minimal Kitaev chain, consisting of two quantum dots connected via a superconductor, can host highly localized near-zero-energy states, known as poor man's Majoranas (PMMs). These states have been proposed as promising candidates to study Majorana bound states (MBSs) in a highly tunable setup. However, it is unclear whether and how PMMs observed in real systems are actually connected to the topological phase of the full Kitaev chain. Here, we study PMMs using a microscopic model and show that, in the long chain limit, not all PMMs are related to topological states. Rather, in long chains, some PMMs evolve into trivial highly localized low-energy states. We provide an explanation for the occurrence of these states and show that there is no clear conductance signature that is able to distinguish PMMs that evolve into true topological states from PMMs that evolve into trivial states.

Title: Non-linear regime of atomic arrays at low drive intensity: controlled generation of multiple subradiant excitations via a multi-photon resonance
Authors: Orazio Scarlatella, Nigel R. Cooper
Abstract: Atomic arrays have emerged as an interesting light-matter platform displaying strong and controllable collective effects. In subwavelength regimes, they are characterized by a manifold of subradiant eigenstates, which can host rich quantum many-body physics and might be useful for applications. Nevertheless, their controlled excitation by a weak coherent drive is prevented by their subradiant nature. While this is true at a linear level, and although the weak-drive regime has been often described using linear theories, we point out that this regime is instead strongly non-linear for regular arrays. Using a dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) approach, we show that by driving weakly a non-linear two-particle resonance, a steady-state with a controlled population of subradiant modes can be obtained. This features a non-zero density of interacting subradiant excitations, displaying multi-mode squeezing correlations and long-range correlations that survive many-body heating effects, even at non-zero drive intensities.

Title: Topological characterization of modified Kane-Mele-Rashba models via local spin Chern marker
Authors: Sebastião dos Anjos Sousa Júnior, Marcus V. de S. Ferraz, José P. de Lima, Tarik P. Cysne
Abstract: In this work, we use the local spin Chern marker (LSCM) recently introduced by Baù and Marrazzo [Phys. Rev. B 110, 054203 (2024)] to analyze the topology of the ground-state electronic wave functions in a finite honeycomb lattice flake described by three distinct models. The models considered here are characterized by strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction, which leads to non-conservation of the spin operator, i.e., $[\mathcal{H},\hat{s}_z]\neq 0$. The three spin-orbit couplings associated with the topological aspects of the models are: 1) Standard Kane-Mele coupling, 2) Sublattice-dependent Kane-Mele coupling, and 3) In-plane ($\hat{s}_y$) polarized Kane-Mele coupling. These couplings occur in graphene grown on suitable substrates and are relevant for modeling its van der Waals heterostructures. A particular topological phase diagram characterizes each of these spin-orbit interactions, and our calculations of LSCM successfully capture its general features. We also performed a detailed analysis of the spectral properties of the energy and valence-projected spin matrix eigenvalues, which shows that both exhibit a gap that protects the marker. Our results expand the applicability of the spin Chern number method to a class of Hamiltonians with experimental relevance and may contribute to future research on the real-space topology of realistic materials.

Title: Slip-dominated structural transitions
Authors: Kanka Ghosh, Oguz Umut Salman, Sylvain Queyreau, Lev Truskinovsky
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may be also interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.

Title: Quantized current steps due to the synchronization of microwaves with Bloch oscillations in small Josephson junctions
Authors: Rais S. Shaikhaidarov, Kyung Ho Kim, Jacob Dunstan, Ilya Antonov, Dmitry Golubev, Vladimir N Antonov, Oleg V Astafiev
Abstract: Synchronization of Bloch oscillations in small Josephson junctions (JJs) under microwave radiation, which leads to current quantization, has been proposed as an effect that is dual to the appearance of Shapiro steps. This current quantization was recently demonstrated in superconducting nanowires in a compact high-impedance environment. Direct observation of current quantization in JJs would cofirm the synchronization of Bloch oscillations with microwaves and help with the realisation of the metrological current standard. Here, we place JJs in a high-impedance environment and demonstrate dual Shapiro steps for frequencies up to 24 GHz (I=7.7 nA). Current quantization exists, however, only in a narrow range of JJ parameters. We carry out a systematic study to explain this by invoking the model of a JJ in the presence of thermal noise. The findings are important for fundamental physics and application in quantum metrology.

Title: Pauli spin blockade at room temperature in double-quantum-dot tunneling transport through individual deep dopants in silicon
Authors: Yoshisuke Ban, Kimihiko Kato, Shota Iizuka, Hiroshi Oka, Shigenori Murakami, Koji Ishibashi, Satoshi Moriyama, Takahiro Mori, Keiji Ono
Abstract: Pauli spin blockade (PSB) is a spin-dependent charge transport process that typically appears in double quantum dot (QD) devices and is employed in fundamental research on single spins in nanostructures to read out semiconductor qubits. The operating temperature of PSB is limited by that of the QDs and remains below 10 K, limiting wide application development. Herein, we confirm that a single deep dopant in the channel of a silicon field effect transistor functions as a room-temperature QD; consequently, transport through two different deep dopants exhibits PSB up to room temperature. The characteristic magnetoconductance provides a means to identify PSB and enables the PSB device to function as a magnetic sensor with a sensitivity below geomagnetic field. Lifting in PSB caused by magnetic resonance (50 K) and Rabi oscillations (10 K) are also observed. Further development of this unique system may lead to room-temperature quantum technologies based on silicon technology.

Title: Normal liquid $^3$He studied by Path Integral Monte Carlo with a parametrized partition function
Authors: Tommaso Morresi, Giovanni Garberoglio
Abstract: We compute the energy per particle of normal liquid ${}^3$He in the temperature range $0.15-2$ K using Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations, leveraging a recently proposed method to overcome the sign problem -- a long-standing challenge in many-body fermionic simulations. This approach is based on introducing a parameter $\xi$ into the partition function, which allows a generalization from bosons ($\xi=1$) to fermions ($\xi=-1$). By simulating systems with $\xi \geq 0$, where the sign problem is absent, one can then extrapolate to the fermionic case at $\xi = -1$. Guided by an independent particle model that uncovers non-analytic behavior due to the superfluid transition, which is moderated by finite-size effects, we develop a tailored extrapolation strategy for liquid ${}^3$He that departs from the extrapolation schemes shown to be accurate in those cases were quantum degeneracy effects are weak, and enables accurate results in the presence of Bose-Einstein Condensation and superfluidity for $\xi > 0$. Our approach extends the previously proposed framework and yields energy per particle values in good agreement with experimental data.

Title: Characterizing the Hard and Soft Nanoparticle-Protein Corona with Multilayer Adsorption
Authors: Oriol Vilanova, Alberto Martinez-Serra, Marco P Monopoli, Giancarlo Franzese
Abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) in contact with biological fluid adsorb biomolecules into a corona. This corona comprises proteins that strongly bind to the NP (hard corona) and loosely bound proteins (soft corona) that dynamically exchange with the surrounding solution. While the kinetics of hard corona formation is relatively well understood, thanks to experiments and robust simulation models, the experimental characterization and simulation of the soft corona present a more significant challenge. Here, we review the current state of the art in soft corona characterization and introduce a novel open-source computational model to simulate its dynamic behavior, for which we provide the documentation. We focus on the case of transferrin (Tf) interacting with polystyrene NPs as an illustrative example, demonstrating how this model captures the complexities of the soft corona and offers deeper insights into its structure and behavior. We show that the soft corona is dominated by a glassy evolution that we relate to crowding effects. This work advances our understanding of the soft corona, bridging experimental limitations with improved simulation techniques.

Title: Higher order potential in the modified convective-viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation
Authors: P.O. Mchedlov-Petrosyan, L.N. Davydov, O.A. Osmaev
Abstract: To describe highly heterogeneous systems using the Cahn-Hilliard equation, the standard form of the thermodynamic potential with a constant coefficient in the gradient term and a polynomial of the fourth degree may not be sufficient. The modification of the form of the thermodynamic potential with a polynomial of the sixth degree and the quadratic dependence of the coefficient at the gradient term is considered. Exact solutions in the form of a moving static wave and the conditions of their existence depending on the symmetry of the potential are obtained.

Title: Topological charge excitations and Green's function zeros in paramagnetic Mott insulator
Authors: Emile Pangburn, Catherine Pépin, Anurag Banerjee
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of topological features in the charge excitations of Mott insulators in the Chern-Hubbard model. In the strong correlation regime, treating electrons as the sum of holons and doublons excitations, we compute the topological phase diagram of Mott insulators at half-filling using composite operator formalism. The Green function zeros manifest as the tightly bound pairs of such elementary excitations of the Mott insulators. Our analysis examines the winding number associated with the occupied Hubbard bands and the band of Green's function zeros. We show that both the poles and zeros show gapless states and zeros, respectively, in line with bulk-boundary correspondence. The gapless edge states emerge in a junction geometry connecting a topological Mott band insulator and a topological Mott zeros phase. These include an edge electronic state that carries a charge and a charge-neutral gapless zero mode. Our study is relevant to several twisted materials with flat bands where interactions play a dominant role.

Title: Anomalous Diffusion of Superparamagnetic Walkers with Tailored Statistics
Authors: Alessia Gentili, Rainer Klages, Giorgio Volpe
Abstract: From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with Lévy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.

Title: Imaging the transition from diffusive to Landauer resistivity dipoles
Authors: David Kämpfer, Serhii Kovalchuk, Jonathan K. Hofmann, Timofey Balashov, Vasily Cherepanov, Bert Voigtländer, Ireneusz Morawski, F. Stefan Tautz, Felix Lüpke
Abstract: A point-like defect in a uniform current-carrying conductor induces a dipole in the electrochemical potential, which counteracts the original transport field. If the mean free path of the carriers is much smaller than the size of the defect, the dipole results from the purely diffusive motion of the carriers around the defect. In the opposite limit, ballistic carriers scatter from the defect $-$ for this situation Rolf Landauer postulated the emergence of a residual resistivity dipole (RRD) that is independent of the defect size and thus imposes a fundamental limit on the resistance of the parent conductor in the presence of defects. Here, we study resistivity dipoles around holes of different sizes in two-dimensional Bi films on Si(111). Using scanning tunneling potentiometry to image the dipoles in real space, we find a transition from linear to constant scaling behavior for small hole sizes, manifesting the transition from diffusive to Landauer dipoles. The extracted parameters of the transition allow us to estimate the Fermi wave vector and the carrier mean free path in our Bi films.

Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity is often accompanied by non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior, which emerges near a quantum critical point (QCP) - a point where an electronic ordered phase is terminated at absolute zero under non-thermal parameters. While nematic orders, characterized by broken rotational symmetry, are sometimes found in unconventional superconductors, the role of nematic fluctuations in driving NFL transport behavior remains unclear. Here, we investigated electrical and thermoelectric transport properties in FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ thin films and observed hallmark NFL behavior: temperature-linear resistivity and logarithmic divergence of thermoelectricity at low temperatures. Notably, the thermoelectricity peaks sharply at the nematic QCP ($x$ = 0.45), highlighting the dominant role of nematic fluctuations in the NFL transport. Furthermore, we found that the pair-breaking mechanisms in the superconducting phase crosses over from orbital- to Pauli-limited effects, indicating the mass enhancement near the nematic critical regime. These findings reveal the profound impact of nematic fluctuations on both normal-state transport and superconducting properties.

Title: Interplay of orbital-selective Mott criticality and flat-band physics in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$
Authors: Frank Lechermann, Steffen Bötzel, Ilya M. Eremin
Abstract: Superconductivity in nickelates apparently takes place in two different Ni oxidation regimes, namely either for infinite-layer-type compounds close to Ni$^{+}$, or for Ruddlesden-Popper materials close to Ni$^{2+}$. The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.

Title: Correlated electronic structures and unconventional superconductivity in bilayer nickelate heterostructures

Abstract: The recent discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates opens new possibilities for investigating electronic structures in this new class of high-transition temperature $T_C$ superconductors. Here, we construct a realistic multi-orbital Hubbard model for the thin-film system, by integrating ab initio calculations with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements, which reveal a higher-symmetry lattice. The interaction parameters are calculated with the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). Density functional theory (DFT) plus cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) calculations, with cRPA calculated on-site Coulomb repulsive $U$ and experimentally measured electron filling $n$, quantitatively reproduces Fermi surfaces from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments. The distinct Fermi surface topology from simple DFT+$U$ results features the indispensable role of correlation effects. Based upon the correlated electronic structures, A modified random-phase-approximation (RPA) approach yields a pronounced $s^{\pm}$-wave pairing instability, due to the strong spin fluctuations originated from Fermi surface nesting between bands with predominantly $d_{z^{2}}$ characters. Our findings highlight the quantitative effectiveness of the DFT+cRPA+CDMFT approach that precisely determines correlated electronic structure parameters without fine-tuning. The revealed intermediate correlation effect may explain the same order-of-magnitude onset $T_C$ observed both in pressured bulk and strained thin film bilayer nickelates.

Title: Large Anomalous Hall Effect in a Noncoplanar Magnetic Heterostructure
Authors: Anke Song, Jine Zhang, Yequan Chen, Zhizhong Zhang, Xinjuan Cheng, Ruijie Xu, Wenzhuo Zhuang, Wenxuan Sun, Yong Zhang, Xu Zhang, Zhongqiang Chen, Fengqi Song, Yue Zhang, Xuechao Zhai, Yongbing Xu, Weisheng Zhao, Rong Zhang, Xuefeng Wang
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) occurs in magnetic systems and also unexpectedly in non-magnetic materials adjacent to magnetic insulators via the heterointerface interactions. However, the AHE in heterostructures induced by magnetic proximity effect remains quite weak, restricting their practical device applications. Here, we report a large intrinsic AHE with a resistivity of 114 n{\Omega} cm at 5 K in noncoplanar magnetic heterostructures of Cr5Te6/Pt. This is the record-high AHE value among all the magnetic insulators/heavy metal heterostructures. A reversal of the AHE signal occurs due to the reconstruction of Berry curvature at the Fermi level, which is verified by the first-principles calculations. Topological spin textures at the interface are directly visualized via high-magnetic-field magnetic force microscopy, which accounts for the large AHE, as confirmed by the atomic simulations. These findings open a new avenue for exploring the large AHE in heterointerfaces and facilitate the potential applications in topological spintronic devices.

Title: Non-equilibrium Dynamics of Fermi Polarons Driven by Time-dependent Interaction
Authors: Fan Yang, Ran Qi
Abstract: We systematically studied the dynamics of Fermi polarons driven by time-dependent scattering length using a time-dependent variational method. Starting from the non-interacting initial state, we calculated the evolution behavior of the contact, energy, and quasiparticle residue of this system as the scattering length $a_s(t)$ increases from zero. In the short-time evolution, we obtained analytical results, verifying that when $a_s(t)$ grows as $\sqrt{t}$, the contact $C(t)$ and energy $E(t)$ exhibit the maximum growth rate. Furthermore, we numerically solved the long-time evolution, when $a_s(t)$ is diven with a strength $\beta$ and a power $\alpha$ as $a_s(t) = {\sqrt{2}\beta}/{k_F} {(\epsilon_Ft)}^{\alpha}$. For large driving strength, due to the interference between the polaron states and the non-interacting states, $C(t)$ and $Z(t)$ exhibit oscillatory behavior; For small $\beta$, the oscillatory behavior disappears due to the decay of the repulsive polaron into the continuum, and $C(t)$ and $Z(t)$ gradually relax to zero. The energy always saturates over long times for different driving strength. Additionally, our method is applicable to any time-dependent form of the scattering length.

Title: Detection and control of electronic orbital magnetism by spin waves in honeycomb ferromagnets
Authors: Lichuan Zhang, Lu Zhang, Dongwook Go, Chengwang Niu, Wulf Wulfhekel, Peng Li, Yuanping Chen, Yuriy Mokrousov, Lizhi Zhang
Abstract: Exploring and manipulating the orbital degrees of freedom in solids has become a fascinating research topic in modern magnetism. Here, we demonstrate that spin waves can provide a way to control electronic orbital magnetism by the mechanism of scalar spin chirality, allowing for experimental detection using techniques such as the magneto-optical Kerr effect and scanning transmission electron microscopy. By applying linear spin wave theory, we uncover that electronic magnon-driven orbital magnetization is extremely sensitive to the character of the magnonic excitations. Furthermore, we show that both the induced electronic orbital magnetism and the Nernst transport properties of the orbital angular momentum can be regulated by the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, Kitaev interaction, as well as the direction and magnitude of the external magnetic field. We argue that magnon-mediated electronic orbital magnetism presents an emergent variable which has to be taken into account when considering the physics of coupling magnonic excitiations to phonons and light.

Title: Matrix Product Density Operators: Renormalization Fixed Points and Boundary Theories
Authors: J.I. Cirac, D. Perez-Garcia, N. Schuch, F. Verstraete
Abstract: We consider the tensors generating matrix product states and density operators in a spin chain. For pure states, we revise the renormalization procedure introduced by F. Verstraete et al. in 2005 and characterize the tensors corresponding to the fixed points. We relate them to the states possessing zero correlation length, saturation of the area law, as well as to those which generate ground states of local and commuting Hamiltonians. For mixed states, we introduce the concept of renormalization fixed points and characterize the corresponding tensors. We also relate them to concepts like finite correlation length, saturation of the area law, as well as to those which generate Gibbs states of local and commuting Hamiltonians. One of the main result of this work is that the resulting fixed points can be associated to the boundary theories of two-dimensional topological states, through the bulk-boundary correspondence introduced by Cirac et al. in 2011.

Title: A toy model solved by statistical mechanics for teaching reaction kinetics beyond ideality
Authors: Doriano Brogioli, Fabio La Mantia
Abstract: Chemical equilibrium is fully characterized by thermodynamics, while the rates of chemical reactions can be calculated for ideal solutions by using mass-action equations. The evaluation of the rates of reactions in a non-ideal system is instead much more complex, even at equilibrium, being dependent on the microscopic features of the interactions: no universal theory exist. Here we propose a toy model to help students understand such complexity. It is formulated by means of statistical mechanics and aims at the evaluation of the exchange reaction rate at equilibrium. The toy model can be solved by the students, with various types of interactions, as an exercise. The results prove that no general rule connects the reaction rates to the thermodynamic quantities, such as the activity coefficients, dramatically proving the complexity and richness of the field.

Title: Dispersion Relations for Dislocation Modes and their Sensitivity to the Lattice Structure
Authors: Jin-Yun Lin, Shashin Pavaskar, Ira Z. Rothstein
Abstract: In this letter we show that the dispersion relation for the dynamical modes of dislocations ("dislons") in solids is sensitive to the lattice symmetries. In particular, we show that in the IR, the dislon dispersion relation develops a logarithmic dependence on momenta for approximately isotropic lattices whereas for non-isotropic lattices, the linear term dominates. The renormalization group flows for dislocation tension are shown to be distinct for isotropic and anisotropic lattices.

Title: Entanglement transitions induced by quantum-data collection
Authors: Shane P. Kelly, Jamir Marino
Abstract: We present an entanglement transition in an array of qubits, induced by the transfer of quantum information from a system to a quantum computer. This quantum-data collection is an essential protocol in quantum machine learning algorithms that promise exponential advantage over their classical counterparts. In this and an accompanying work [Phys. Rev. A 111, 012425 (2025)], we identify sufficient conditions for an entanglement transition to occur in the late time state of the system and quantum computer. In this letter, we present an example entanglement transition occurring in a system comprised of a 1D chain of qubits evolving under a random brickwork circuit. After each layer, a fraction $p$ of sites undergo noisy quantum transduction in which quantum information is transferred to a quantum computer but at the cost of introducing noise from an environment. For an entanglement transition to occur, we argue that the environment must obtain the same amount of information as gained by the computer. Under this condition, the circuit shows a transition from volume law to area law entanglement as the rate $p$ is increased above a critical threshold. Our work delineates the prerequisites for quantum-data collection to induce entanglement transitions, thereby establishing a foundational framework for emergent entanglement phenomena in protocols relevant to quantum machine learning.

Title: Compact computer controlled biaxial tensile device for low-temperature transport measurements of layered materials
Authors: S.V. Zaitsev-Zotov
Abstract: A biaxial tensile device for the transport study of layered materials is described. The device is mounted on the standard 24 pin zero force connector and can be moved between various setups. The compact design of the device makes it suitable for a wide range of studies. In our case, it is placed inside a 50 mm diameter chamber in the cryocooler and is used in the temperature range 9-310 K. A sample is glued in the center of a polyimide cruciform substrate, the ends of which are connected to a tension system driven by four computer-controlled stepper motors providing tensile force up to 30 N. Computer simulation results and their experimental verification show that tensile strain along one axis depends on the tensile load along the perpendicular direction, and this dependence turns out to be relatively strong and exceeds 40\%. The operation of the device is demonstrated by studying the effect of deformation on the electrical conductivity of the layered compound 2H-NbS2.

Title: Generalizing measurement-induced phase transitions to information exchange symmetry breaking
Authors: Shane P. Kelly, Jamir Marino
Abstract: In this work we investigate the conditions for quantum back action to result in a phase transition in the information dynamics of a monitored system. We introduce a framework that captures a wide range of experiments encompassing probes comprised of projective measurements and probes which more generally transfer quantum information from the system to a quantum computer. Our framework explicitly uses a model of unitary evolution which couples system, apparatus and environment. Information dynamics is investigated using the Rényi and von-Neumann entropies of the evolving state, and we construct a replica theory for them. We identify the possible replica symmetries an experiment can possess and discuss their spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we identify a minimum subgroup whose spontaneous symmetry breaking results in an entanglement transition. This symmetry is only possible when the information in the apparatus is as informative about the dynamics of the system as the information transferred to the environment. We call this requirement the information exchange symmetry and quantify it by a relationship between the entropies. We then show how the entanglement transition can be understood as the spontaneously breaking of the information exchange symmetry and without referring to the replica theory. Information exchange symmetry breaking is then shown to generalize the phenomenology of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We apply this theory to the brickwork quantum-enhanced experiment introduced in an accompanying Letter [Phys. Rev. A 111, L010402 (2025) ] in the case where the unitaries are chosen from the Haar measure, and identify a distinct universality from the MIPT. This notion of information exchange symmetry breaking generalizes the MIPT, and provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of quantum information in quantum-enhanced experiments.

Title: Engineering Hierarchical Symmetries
Authors: Zhanpeng Fu, Roderich Moessner, Hongzheng Zhao, Marin Bukov
Abstract: The capacity to custom tailor the properties of quantum matter and materials is a central requirement for enlarging their range of possible functionalities. A particularly promising route is the use of driving protocols to engineer specific desired properties with a high degree of control and flexibility. Here, we present such a program for the tunable generation of sequences of symmetries on controllable timescales. Concretely, our general driving protocol for many-body systems generates a sequence of prethermal regimes, each exhibiting a lower symmetry than the preceding one. We provide an explicit construction of effective Hamiltonians exhibiting these symmetries, which imprints emergent quasiconservation laws hierarchically, enabling us to engineer the respective symmetries and concomitant orders in nonequilibrium matter. We provide explicit examples, including spatiotemporal and topological phenomena, as well as a spin chain realizing the symmetry ladder $\text{SU(2)}{\rightarrow}\text{U(1)} {\rightarrow} \mathbb{Z}_2{\rightarrow} E$. Our results have direct applications in experiments with quantum simulators.

Title: Unifying Collisional Models and the Monte Carlo Metropolis Method: Algorithms for Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Nathan M. Myers, Hrushikesh Sable, Vito W. Scarola
Abstract: Classical systems placed in contact with a thermal bath will inevitably equilibrate to a thermal state at the bath temperature. The same is not generally true for open quantum systems, which place additional conditions on the structure of the bath and system-bath interaction if thermalization is to occur. Collisional models, or repeated interaction schemes, are a category of microscopic open quantum system models that have seen growing use in studying quantum thermalization, in which the bath is modeled as a large ensemble of identical ancilla systems that sequentially interact with the system. We demonstrate that, when each bath ancilla is prepared in a thermal state with a discrete spectrum that matches the energy eigenstate transitions of the system, the system dynamics generated by the collisional model framework are identical to those generated under the Metropolis algorithm. This equivalence holds not just in the steady state regime, but also in the transient regime. As the Metropolis scheme does not require explicitly modeling the system-bath interaction, this allows it to be used as a computationally efficient alternative for simulating collisional model dynamics.

Title: Floquet SYK wormholes
Authors: Martí Berenguer, Anshuman Dey, Javier Mas, Juan Santos-Suárez, Alfonso V. Ramallo
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of two coupled SYK models, conjectured to be holographically dual to an eternal traversable wormhole in AdS$_2$. We consider different periodic drivings of the parameters of the system. We analyze the energy flows in the wormhole and black hole phases of the model as a function of the driving frequency. Our numerical results show a series of resonant frequencies in which the energy absorption and heating are enhanced significantly and the transmission coefficients drop, signalling a closure of the wormhole. These frequencies correspond to part of the conformal tower of states and to the boundary graviton of the dual gravitational theory. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the existence of a hot wormhole phase between the black hole and wormhole phases. When driving the strength of the separate SYK terms we find that the transmission can be enhanced by suitably tuning the driving.

Title: Thermophotovoltaic performance metrics and techno-economics: efficiency vs. power density
Authors: Shomik Verma, Kyle Buznitsky, Asegun Henry
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) are a promising new approach for converting heat to electricity. Their performance is primarily characterized by two metrics: efficiency and power density. While recent works have shown high efficiency, it is important to understand how both of these metrics impact the techno-economics of a TPV system as efforts to commercialize the technology advance. In this work, we develop the first unification of efficiency and power density into a single techno-economic metric based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). We find that the LCOE can be broken into two parts: heating cost, including infrastructure and inputs for providing heat to the TPV cells, and cell cost, the capital cost of the TPV cells. We show that systems with high heating costs should prioritize TPV efficiency, while systems with high cell costs should prioritize power density. We then develop a model to identify the most impactful cell properties in improving the important performance metric and reducing system LCOE. Namely, improving spectral control with increased back-surface reflectance is the most effective to reduce LCOE in systems with high infrastructural costs, while increasing the view factor and reducing front-surface reflectance are most critical in systems with high TPV cell cost. Improving just one or two of these properties can reduce the LCOE by 25-75%, reaching competitive values ~ 8 cents/kWh-e, less than the average cost of electricity in the US. This study thus elucidates which TPV performance metric is more important for system technoeconomics and how to maximize it.

Title: Floquet Schrieffer-Wolff transform based on Sylvester equations
Authors: Xiao Wang, Fabio Pablo Miguel Méndez-Córdoba, Dieter Jaksch, Frank Schlawin
Abstract: We present a Floquet Schrieffer Wolff transform (FSWT) to obtain effective Floquet Hamiltonians and micro-motion operators of periodically driven many-body systems for any non-resonant driving frequency. The FSWT perturbatively eliminates the oscillatory components in the driven Hamiltonian by solving operator-valued Sylvester equations with systematic approximations. It goes beyond various high-frequency expansion methods commonly used in Floquet theory, as we demonstrate with the example of the driven Fermi-Hubbard model. In the limit of high driving frequencies, the FSWT Hamiltonian reduces to the widely used Floquet-Magnus result. We anticipate this method will be useful for designing Rydberg multi-qubit gates, controlling correlated hopping in quantum simulations in optical lattices, and describing multi-orbital and long-range interacting systems driven in-gap.

Title: Holographic deep thermalization: theory and experimentation
Authors: Bingzhi Zhang, Peng Xu, Xiaohui Chen, Quntao Zhuang
Abstract: Randomness is a cornerstone of science, underpinning fields such as statistics, information theory, dynamical systems, and thermodynamics. In quantum science, quantum randomness, especially random pure states, plays a pivotal role in fundamental questions like black hole physics and quantum complexity, as well as in practical applications such as quantum device benchmarking and quantum advantage certification. The conventional approach for generating genuine random states, called `deep thermalization', faces significant challenges, including scalability issues due to the need for a large ancilla system and susceptibility to attacks, as demonstrated in this work. We introduce holographic deep thermalization, a secure and hardware-efficient quantum random state generator. By adopting a sequential application of a scrambling-measure-reset process, it continuously trades space with time, and substantially reduces the required ancilla size to as small as a system-size independent constant; At the same time, it guarantees security by removing quantum correlation between the data system and attackers. Thanks to the resource reduction, our circuit-based implementation on IBM Quantum devices achieves genuine $5$-qubit random state generation utilizing only a total of $8$ qubits.

Title: Entanglement growth in the dark intervals of a locally monitored free-fermion chain
Authors: Giovanni Di Fresco, Youenn Le Gal, Davide Valenti, Marco Schirò, Angelo Carollo
Abstract: We consider a free fermionic chain with monitoring of the particle density on a single site of the chain and study the entanglement dynamics of quantum jump trajectories. We show that the entanglement entropy grows in time towards a stationary state which display volume law scaling of the entropy, in stark contrast with both the unitary dynamics after a local quench and the no-click limit corresponding to full post-selection. We explain the extensive entanglement growth as a consequence of the peculiar distribution of quantum jumps in time, which display superpoissonian waiting time distribution characterised by a bunching of quantum jumps followed by long dark intervals where no-clicks are detected, akin to the distribution of fluorescence light in a driven atom. We show that the presence of dark intervals is the key feature to explain the effect and that by increasing the number of sites which are monitored the volume law scaling gives away to the Zeno effect and its associated area law.

Title: Correlations, Spectra and Entanglement Transitions in Ensembles of Matrix Product States
Authors: Hugo Lóio, Guillaume Cecile, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Guglielmo Lami, Jacopo De Nardis
Abstract: We investigate ensembles of Matrix Product States (MPSs) generated by quantum circuit evolution followed by projection onto MPSs with a fixed bond dimension $\chi$. Specifically, we consider ensembles produced by: (i) random sequential unitary circuits, (ii) random brickwork unitary circuits, and (iii) circuits involving both unitaries and projective measurements. In all cases, we analyze the spectra of the MPS transfer matrices and relate them to the spreading of mutual information in the MPS state. We demonstrate how different features of the spectral density correspond to distinct types of circuits, revealing that these MPS ensembles retain crucial physical information about the underlying microscopic dynamics. Notably, in the presence of quantum monitoring, we show the existence of a measurement-induced entanglement transition (MIPT) in MPS ensembles, with the averaged dimension of the transfer matrix's null space serving as the effective order parameter.

Title: Hot wormholes and chaos dynamics in a two-coupled SYK model
Authors: Martí Berenguer, Javier Mas, Juan Santos-Suárez, Alfonso V. Ramallo
Abstract: We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase, which is inaccessible through equilibrium simulations: one involves cooling the system via a coupling to a thermal bath, while in the other we periodically drive the coupling parameter between the two sides. We numerically compute the Lyapunov exponents of the hot wormhole for the two cases. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation, which captures certain but not all aspects of the observed dynamics.

Title: Measurement and Teleportation in the cSYK/JT Correspondence
Authors: Raphael Brinster, Stefan Forste, Yannic Kruse, Saurabh Natu
Abstract: We consider two complex SYK models entangled in a thermofield double (TFD) state and investigate the effect of one-sided projective measurements. As measurement operator we choose single site charge operators. Performing a measurement results in a non-zero $U(1)$ charge. The entropy curve differs from the previously studied SYK model due to a thermodynamic phase transition that takes place after a certain charge is reached. We also match our results to a dual bulk description. Finally, a teleportation protocol is provided to support the notion of a traversable wormhole being formed.
