Title: A General Neural Network Potential for Energetic Materials with C, H, N, and O elements
Authors: Mingjie Wen, Jiahe Han, Wenjuan Li, Xiaoya Chang, Qingzhao Chu, Dongping Chen
Abstract: The discovery and optimization of high-energy materials (HEMs) are constrained by the prohibitive computational expense and prolonged development cycles inherent in conventional approaches. In this work, we develop a general neural network potential (NNP) that efficiently predicts the structural, mechanical, and decomposition properties of HEMs composed of C, H, N, and O. Our framework leverages pre-trained NNP models, fine-tuned using transfer learning on energy and force data derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This strategy enables rapid adaptation across 20 different HEM systems while maintaining DFT-level accuracy, significantly reducing computational costs. A key aspect of this work is the ability of NNP model to capture the chemical activity space of HEMs, accurately describe the key atomic interactions and reaction mechanisms during thermal decomposition. The general NNP model has been applied in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and validated with experimental data for various HEM structures. Results show that the NNP model accurately predicts the structural, mechanical, and decomposition properties of HEMs by effectively describing their chemical activity space. Compared to traditional force fields, it offers superior DFT-level accuracy and generalization across both microscopic and macroscopic properties, reducing the computational and experimental costs. This work provides an efficient strategy for the design and development of HEMs and proposes a promising framework for integrating DFT, machine learning, and experimental methods in materials research. (To facilitate further research and practical applications, we open-source our NNP model on GitHub: this https URL.)

Title: Unveiling temperature and phase boundaries in laser-driven shocked and released copper: insights from ultra-fast X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy up to 300 GPa
Authors: Sofia Balugani, Jean-Alexis Hernandez, Fabien Brieuc, James Boust, Philipp Hesselbach, Nicolas SÃ©velin-Radiguet, Vanina Recoules, Olivier Mathon, Daniel E. Eakins, Hugo Doyle, Alessandra Ravasio, Raffaella Torchio
Abstract: Cu is an ubiquitous material used in industry for its great thermal and electrical properties. Studying the high-pressure high temperature properties of copper (Cu) is relevant for nuclear fusion research as projectiles and flyers used in hypervelocity impacts are generally made of copper, where it is used also in the design of the nuclear fusion targets. Recently, a solid (fcc)-solid (bcc) phase transition has been detected in shock compressed Cu with X-Ray Diffraction. Here, we present a study on shock compressed copper up to 300 GPa and 7100 K probed by single pulse (100 ps FWHM) X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). Based on the analysis of the XAS spectra, we provide structural identification and bulk temperature measurements along the Hugoniot up to the melting. The collection of XAS spectra under release conditions, i.e. at later times than the breakout time of the shock wave, helped constraining the experimental fcc-bcc and solid-liquid phase boundaries. In particular, we report the first bulk temperature measurement in shock compressed copper on the melting plateau located between 237(40) GPa and 5750(1130) K and 261 (27) GPa and 6240 (1155) K and on liquid copper at 300 GPa and 7100 K.

Title: Spectroscopic classification of non-ergodic populations
Authors: Nicolas Underwood, Fabien Paillusson
Abstract: Non-ergodicity impacts statistical inference in a diverse range of disciplines inside and outside of physics. However the concept of ergodicity is used inconsistently, and may refer to several nonequivalent notions. To help address this, we first identify and clarify the relationship between three major interpretations of ergodicity. We then introduce a method of spectral analysis of non-ergodicity which may be performed using data alone, and so may be applied in both numerical and empirical contexts. This may be used to identify, quantify, and classify non-ergodic populations within an ergodic decomposition. This is demonstrated with an application to the Kob-Andersen kinetically constrained lattice glass model.

Title: Nonreciprocity of hydrodynamic electron transport in noncentrosymmetric conductors
Authors: E. Kirkinis, L. Bonds, A. Levchenko, A. V. Andreev
Abstract: We show that the nonreciprocity of hydrodynamic electron transport in noncentrosymmetric conductors with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is significantly enhanced compared to the disorder-dominated regime. This enhancement is caused by the linear dependence of the viscosity of the electron liquid on the flow velocity, which is allowed in the absence of TRS and Galilean invariance. The resulting nonlinear flows do not possess dynamical similarity and are characterized by two dimensionless parameters: the Reynolds number and the nonreciprocity number. The latter is linear in velocity but independent of system size. We determine the nonlinear conductance of a Hall bar and show that the nonreciprocal correction to the current can be of comparable magnitude to its reciprocal counterpart.

Title: Enforced Gaplessness from States with Exponentially Decaying Correlations
Authors: Rahul Sahay, Curt von Keyserlingk, Ruben Verresen, Carolyn Zhang
Abstract: It is well known that an exponentially localized Hamiltonian must be gapless if its ground state has algebraic correlations. We show that even certain exponentially decaying correlations can imply gaplessness. This is exemplified by the deformed toric code $\propto \exp(\beta \sum_{\ell} Z_{\ell}) |\mathsf{TC}\rangle$, where $|\mathsf{TC}\rangle$ is a fixed-point toric code wavefunction. Although it has a confined regime for $\beta > \beta_c$, recent work has drawn attention to its perimeter law loop correlations. Here, we show that these unusual loop correlations -- namely, perimeter law coexisting with a 1-form symmetry whose disorder operator has long-range order -- imply that any local parent Hamiltonian must either be gapless or have a degeneracy scaling with system size. Moreover, we construct a variational low-energy state for arbitrary local frustration-free Hamiltonians, upper bounding the finite-size gap by $O(1/L^3)$ on periodic boundary conditions. Strikingly, these variational states look like loop waves -- non-quasiparticle analogs of spin waves -- generated from the ground state by non-local loop operators. Our findings have implications for identifying the subset of Hilbert space to which gapped ground states belong, and the techniques have wide applicability. For instance, a corollary of our first result is that Glauber dynamics for the ordered phase of the two-dimensional classical Ising model on the torus must have a gapless Markov transition matrix, with our second result bounding its gap.

Title: Superconducting qubit based on a single molecule: the carbon nanotube gatemon
Authors: H. Riechert, S. Annabi, A. Peugeot, H. Duprez, M. Hantute, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, E. Arrighi, J. Griesmar, J.-D. Pillet, L. Bretheau
Abstract: Gate-tunable transmon qubits are based on quantum conductors used as weak links within hybrid Josephson junctions. These gatemons have been implemented in just a handful of systems, all relying on extended conductors, namely epitaxial semiconductors or exfoliated graphene. Here we present the coherent control of a gatemon based on a single molecule, a one-dimensional carbon nanotube, which is integrated into a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. The measured qubit spectrum can be tuned with a gate voltage and reflects the quantum dot behaviour of the nanotube. Our ultraclean integration, using a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, results in record coherence times of 200ns for such a qubit. Furthermore, we investigate its decoherence mechanisms, thus revealing a strong gate dependence and identifying charge noise as a limiting factor. On top of positioning carbon nanotubes as contenders for future quantum technologies, our work paves the way for studying microscopic fermionic processes in low-dimensional quantum conductors.

Title: Statistical mechanics of a cold tracer in a hot bath
Authors: Amer Al-Hiyasat, Sunghan Ro, Julien Tailleur
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a zero-temperature particle interacting linearly with a bath of hot Brownian particles. Starting with the most general model of a linearly-coupled bath, we eliminate the bath degrees of freedom exactly to map the tracer dynamics onto a generalized Langevin equation, allowing for an arbitrary external potential on the tracer. We apply this result to determine the fate of a tracer connected by springs to $N$ identical bath particles or inserted within a harmonic chain of hot particles. In the former "fully-connected" case, we find the tracer to transition between an effective equilibrium regime at large $N$ and an FDT-violating regime at finite $N$, while in the latter "loop" model the tracer never satisfies an FDT. We then study the fully-connected model perturbatively for large but finite $N$, demonstrating signatures of irreversibility such as ratchet currents, non-Boltzmann statistics, and positive entropy production. Finally, we specialize to harmonic external potentials on the tracer, allowing us to exactly solve the dynamics of both the tracer and the bath for an arbitrary linear model. We apply our findings to show that a cold tracer in a hot lattice suppresses the fluctuations of the lattice in a long-ranged manner, and we generalize this result to linear elastic field theories.

Title: At extreme strain rates, pure metals thermally harden while alloys thermally soften
Authors: Ian Dowding, Christopher A. Schuh
Abstract: When materials are deformed at extreme strain rates, greater than $10^6 \text{ s}^{-1}$, a counterintuitive mechanical response is seen where the strength and hardness of pure metals increases with increasing temperature. The anti-thermal hardening is due to defects in the material becoming pinned by phonons in the crystal lattice. However, here, using optically driven microballistic impact testing to measure the dynamic strength and hardness, we show that when the composition is systematically varied away from high purity, the mechanical response of metals transitions from ballistic transport of dislocations back to thermally activated pinning of dislocations, even at the highest strain rates. This boundary from "hotter-is-stronger" to "hotter-is-softer" is observed and mapped for nickel, titanium, and gold. The ability to tune between deformation mechanisms with very different temperature dependencies speaks to new directions for alloy design in extreme conditions.

Title: Stabilization of three-body resonances to bound states in a continuum
Authors: Lucas Happ, Pascal Naidon
Abstract: Three-body resonances are ubiquitous in few-body physics and are characterized by a finite lifetime before decaying into continuum states of their composing subsystems. In this work we present a theoretical study on the possibility to stabilize three-body resonances to so-called bound states in a continuum: resonances with vanishing width that do not decay. Within a simple two-channel approach we unveil the underlying mechanism and suggest that the lifetime can be varied by a continuous tuning of system parameters. The validity of our theory is illustrated in two rather different examples, a mass-imbalanced system in one dimension and a system of three identical bosons in three dimensions, relevant to Efimov physics. Crucially, for the latter we find that one of the tunable parameters to achieve a three-body bound state in a continuum is an external magnetic field, a common tunable variable in cold-atom experiments. Due to the fundamental nature of our theory, it is expected to hold in other few-body systems, possibly opening new avenues for basic studies of otherwise unstable systems, and elevating few-body systems to interesting candidates for quantum technology.

Title: Metastability and Ostwald Step Rule in the Crystallisation of Diamond and Graphite from Molten Carbon
Authors: Davide Donadio, Margaret L. Berrens, Wanyu Zhao, Shunda Chen, Tianshu Li
Abstract: The crystallisation of carbon from the melt under extreme conditions is highly relevant to earth and planetary science, materials manufacturing, and nuclear fusion research. The thermodynamic conditions near the graphite-diamond-liquid (GDL) triple point are especially of interest for geological and technological applications, but high-pressure flash heating experiments aiming to resolve this region of the phase diagram of carbon exhibit large discrepancies. Experimental challenges are often related to the persistence of metastable crystalline or glassy phases, superheated crystals, or supercooled liquids. A deeper understanding of the crystallisation kinetics of diamond and graphite is crucial for effectively interpreting the outcomes of these experiments. Here, we reveal the microscopic mechanisms of diamond and graphite nucleation from liquid carbon through molecular simulations with first-principles machine learning potentials. Our simulations accurately reproduce the experimental phase diagram of carbon in the region around the GDL triple point and show that liquid carbon crystallises spontaneously upon cooling at constant pressure. Surprisingly, metastable graphite crystallises in the domain of diamond thermodynamic stability at pressures above the triple point. Furthermore, whereas diamond crystallises through a classical nucleation pathway, graphite follows a two-step process in which low-density fluctuations forego ordering. Calculations of the nucleation rates of the two competing phases confirm this result and reveal a manifestation of Ostwald's step rule where the strong metastability of graphite hinders the transformation to the stable diamond phase. Our results provide a new key to interpreting melting and recrystallisation experiments and shed light on nucleation kinetics in polymorphic materials with deep metastable states.

Title: Tunable Non-Equilibrium Magic and Minimum Twist Angles in AA-Stacked Twisted Multilayer Graphene
Authors: Yantao Li, Wang-Kong Tse
Abstract: We report the discovery of a series of non-equilibrium magic angles at which isolated topological flat quasienergy bands form in AA-stacked twisted multilayer graphene under circularly polarized light. These non-equilibrium magic angles can be traced back to specific static twist angles where the bandwidth reaches a minimum \textit{without} the formation of isolated flat bands. We refer to these as minimum twist angles, in contrast to the magic angles observed in twisted bilayer graphene. We show that an applied displacement field can further flatten the optically induced topological flat bands accompanied by larger non-equilibrium magic angles. The discovery of these electrically tunable topological flat quasienergy bands is expected to open up a new avenue of exploring exotic Floquet-driven phenomena in AA-stacked twisted multilayer graphene.

Title: Sliding-induced topological transitions in bilayer biphenylene
Authors: L. L. Lage, S. Bravo, O. Arroyo-GascÃ³n, Leonor Chico, A. LatgÃ©
Abstract: Sliding-induced topological transitions in biphenylene bilayers are investigated, considering various stacking configurations which are analyzed from a symmetry perspective and described in detail,highlighting the intricate patterns of type-II Dirac cone crossings. Topological changes in the Fermi surface are assessed via the Euler characteristic, linking each transition to its corresponding symmetry, which can be experimentally tested by conductance measurements. Moreover, the ability to tune these topological properties by sliding the layers provides a simpler and more effective way to observe such phenomena.

Title: Phase diagram of a coupled trimer system at half filling using the Hubbard model
Authors: Sourabh Saha, Hosho Katsura, Manoranjan Kumar
Abstract: Flat band systems have recently attracted significant attention due to their instability under small perturbations, which can lead to the stabilization of many exotic quantum phases. We study a trimer ladder which shows a middle flat band in the absence of onsite Coulomb interaction. We investigate the quantum phases of the Hubbard model on this geometry using exact diagonalization (ED), density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and perturbation theory. We construct a quantum phase diagram in the plane of the next-nearest-neighbor hopping parameter $t_2$ and onsite Coulomb interaction $U$, revealing five distinct quantum phases. At low $U$ and moderate to high magnitude of $t_2$, the system exhibits metallic behavior, while at large $U$ and small magnitude of $t_2$, it transitions to a ferrimagnetic insulator phase, similar to those observed in certain trimer materials. In the small $t_2$ limit, the Fermi energy is in the flat band, leading to localization of the electrons within the trimer. At low $U$ and small magnitude of $t_2$, the flat band mechanism favors insulating ferrimagnetism, whereas at large $U$, ferrimagnetic states emerge from singlet dimer formation between neighboring sites of a trimer and an isolated corner spin, which connect ferromagnetically. The insulating cell spin density wave phase displays an up-up-down-down spin configuration due to competing nearest neighbor hopping, $t_1$. Interestingly, in moderate $U$ and $|t_2|>0.3$, the ground state behaves like metallic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid.

Title: Light Control of Triplet Pairing in Correlated Electrons with Mixed-Sign Interactions
Authors: Zecheng Shen, Chendi Xie, Wei-Chih Chen, Yao Wang
Abstract: Spin-triplet superconductivity is a key platform for topological quantum computing, yet its experimental realization and control in solid-state materials remain a significant challenge. For this purpose, we propose an ultrafast optical strategy to manipulate spin-triplet superconductivity by leveraging $p$-wave pairing instabilities in the extended Hubbard model, a framework applicable to transition-metal oxides. Utilizing Floquet engineering, we demonstrate that transient flipping of the effective spin-exchange interaction can enhance $p$-wave pairing correlations under linearly polarized optical pulses. Furthermore, we reveal that this emergent spin-triplet pairing in strongly correlated systems can be selectively switched by an orthogonal optical pulse. This work provides a new pathway for stabilizing and controlling spin-triplet superconductivity in correlated materials.

Title: Exploring the world of rhamnolipids: A critical review of their production, interfacial properties, and potential application
Authors: Eduardo Guzman, Francisco Ortega, Ramon G. Rubio
Abstract: Rhamnolipids are very promising sugar-based biosurfactants, generally produced by bacteria, with a wide range of properties that can be exploited at an industrial and technological level, e.g. in cosmetics, food science, or oil recovery, to provide benefits for human health and the environment. This has led to intensive research into optimizing their production to increase yields and minimize costs, which is challenging because biotechnological methods for rhamnolipid production result in complex product mixtures and require the introduction of complex separation strategies to ensure the purity of the rhamnolipid obtained. This is an important issue for the introduction of rhamnolipids to the market due to the differences that exist between the properties of the different congeners. This review attempts to provide an overview of the interfacial properties, potential applications, and recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern the adsorption to interfaces and assembly in solution of rhamnolipids. In addition, the review also discusses some general aspects related to the production and purification methods of rhamnolipids, highlighting the need for further research to fully exploit their potential. It is hoped that this review will contribute to the growing body of knowledge about rhamnolipids and stimulate further research in this field.

Title: Polymerization of environmentally stable 1D-NF chain with high-energy density
Authors: Guo Chen, Ling Lin, Chengfeng Zhang, Jie Zhang, Xianlong Wang
Abstract: Based on first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics methods, the energies density, suitable precursor, and synthesis conditions of Cmca-type NF compound with 1D chain feature are investigated. We find that if using Al as reducing agent, it possesses an gravimetric energy density of 13.55 kJ/g higher than that of cg-N (9.70 kJ/g), since it has both polymerized nitrogen and strong oxidizing F atoms. The cis N2F2 molecules is a suitable precursor, and they can polymerize to cis NF chains above 90 GPa. Furthermore, the phase diagram of Cmca-type NF compound is established at conditions of 0-3000 K and 0-200 GPa. Importantly, NF chains polymerized under high temperature and pressure can be quenched to ambient conditions.

Title: Giant moment increase by ultrafast laser light
Authors: Sangeeta Sharma, Deepika Gill, Jyoti Krishna, Eddie Harris-Lee, John Kay Dewhurst, Sam Shallcross
Abstract: It is now well established that a few femtosecond laser pulse will induce an ultrafast loss of moment in a magnetic material. Here we show that the opposite effect can also occur: an ultrafast increase in moment. Employing both tight-binding and state-of-the-art time dependent density functional theory we find that laser light tuned to the majority spin conduction band in the 2d magnets CrI$_3$ and CrSBr generates an ultrafast giant moment increase, of up to 33\% in the case of CrI$_3$ (2~$\mu_B$). Underpinning this is spin-orbit induced valence band spin texture that, in combination with a strong field light pulse, facilitates an optical spin flip transition involving both intra- and inter-band excitation. Our findings, that establish a general mechanism by which ultrafast light pulses may enhance as well as decrease the magnetic moment, point towards rich possibilities for light control over magnetic matter at femtosecond times.

Title: Electronic structures of crystalline and amorphous GeSe and GeSbTe compounds using machine learning empirical pseudopotentials
Authors: Sungmo Kang, Rokyeon Kim, Seungwu Han, Young-Woo Son
Abstract: The newly developed machine learning (ML) empirical pseudopotential (EP) method overcomes the poor transferability of the traditional EP method with the help of ML techniques while preserving its formal simplicity and computational efficiency. We apply the new method to binary and ternary systems such as GeSe and Ge-Sb-Te (GST) compounds, well-known materials for non-volatile phase-change memory and related technologies. Using a training set of {\it ab initio} electronic energy bands and rotation-covariant descriptors for various GeSe and GST compounds, we generate transferable EPs for Ge, Se, Sb, and Te. We demonstrate that the new ML model accurately reproduces the energy bands and wavefunctions of structures outside the training set, closely matching first-principles calculations. This accuracy is achieved with significantly lower computational costs due to the elimination of self-consistency iterations and the reduced size of the plane-wave basis set. Notably, the method maintains accuracy even for diverse local atomic environments, such as amorphous phases or larger systems not explicitly included in the training set.

Title: Wyckoff Transformer: Generation of Symmetric Crystals
Authors: Nikita Kazeev, Wei Nong, Ignat Romanov, Ruiming Zhu, Andrey Ustyuzhanin, Shuya Yamazaki, Kedar Hippalgaonkar
Abstract: Symmetry rules that atoms obey when they bond together to form an ordered crystal play a fundamental role in determining their physical, chemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength. Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. Consistently generating stable crystal structures is still an open challenge, specifically because such symmetry rules are not accounted for. To address this issue, we propose WyFormer, a generative model for materials conditioned on space group symmetry. We use Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer and an absence of positional encoding. WyFormer has a unique and powerful synergy of attributes, proven by extensive experimentation: best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, physics-motivated inductive bias, competitive stability of the generated structures, competitive material property prediction quality, and unparalleled inference speed.

Title: Measurement-Induced Crossover of Quantum Jump Statistics in Postselection-Free Many-Body Dynamics
Authors: Kazuki Yamamoto, Ryusuke Hamazaki
Abstract: We reveal a nontrivial crossover of subsystem fluctuations of quantum jumps in continuously monitored many-body systems, which have a trivial maximally mixed state as a steady-state density matrix. While the fluctuations exhibit the standard volume law $\propto L$ following Poissonian statistics for sufficiently weak measurement strength, anomalous yet universal scaling law $\propto L^\alpha \:(\alpha\sim 2.7)$ indicating super-Poissonian statistics appears for strong measurement strength. This drastically affects the precision of estimating the rate of quantum jumps: for strong (weak) measurement, the estimation uncertainty is enhanced (suppressed) as the system size increases. We demonstrate that the anomalous scaling of the subsystem fluctuation originates from an integrated many-body autocorrelation function and that the transient dynamics contributes to the scaling law rather than the Liouvillian gap. The measurement-induced crossover is accessed only from the postselection-free information obtained from the time and the position of quantum jumps and can be tested in ultracold atom experiments.

Title: Structural and Dynamical Behaviors of Fast Ionic Conducting Potassium nido-(Carba)borates
Authors: Mads B. Amdisen, Hui Wu, Mikael S. Andersson, Mirjana Dimitrievska, Wei Zhou, Torben R. Jensen, Craig M. Brown, Juscelino B. LeÃ£o, Terrence J. Udovic
Abstract: Solid-state batteries are one of the most recent iterations of electrochemical energy storage, and the technology can potentially provide safer and more-energy-dense batteries. The metal closo- and nido-(carba)borates show promise as versatile solid electrolytes and have been shown to have some of the highest ionic conductivities as well as wide electrochemical stability windows. In the present study, we investigate the four potassium nido-(carba)borates KB$_{11}$H$_{14}$, K-7-CB$_{10}$H$_{13}$, K-7,8-C$_2$B$_9$H$_{12}$, and K-7,9-C$_2$B$_9$H$_{12}$, and a total of eight new crystal structures were solved. All four compounds transition from a low-temperature, ordered phase to a high-temperature, disordered phase with the space group Fm-3m. In the high-temperature polymorphs, the anions are disordered and undergo rapid reorientational dynamics, which is confirmed by quasielastic neutron scattering experiments. Reorientational activation energies of 0.151(2) eV, 0.146(32) eV, and 0.143(3) eV were determined for K-7-CB$_{10}$H$_{13}$, K-7,8-C$_2$B$_9$H$_{12}$, and K-7,9-C$_2$B$_9$H$_{12}$, respectively. Additionally, such rotationally fluid anions are concomitant with fast potassium-ion conductivity. The highest ionic conductivity is observed for K-7,8-C$_2$B$_9$H$_{12}$ with 1.7$\times$10$^{-2}$ Scm$^{-1}$ at 500 K and an activation energy of 0.28 eV in the disordered state. The differences in phase transition temperatures, reorientational dynamics, and ionic conductivities between the potassium nido-(carba)borates illustrate a strong correlation between the K$^+$ cationic mobility and the local cation-anion interactions, anion dynamics, and the specific positions of the carbon-atoms in the nido-(carba)borate anion cages.

Title: Spiral folding of a flexible chain of chiral active particles
Authors: Shalabh K. Anand
Abstract: We investigate a flexible polymer chain made up of chiral active Brownian particles in two dimensions using computer simulations. In the presence of chiral active Brownian forces, the radius of gyration of the chain reduces significantly. We further identify the formation of spirals using the tangent-tangent correlation to characterize the internal structure of the chain. The polymer chain forms a pair of spirals with opposite spiral turns on both ends of the polymer. We compute the number of turns of both spirals, and find that the total number of turns increases with angular frequency as well as P{Ã©}clet number. However, the spirals become weak and the number of turns decreases at a very high P{Ã©}clet number. We draw a phase diagram using the turn number. The end-to-end correlation displays oscillatory behavior, which signifies the rotational dynamics of the chain. We quantify the rotation frequency from the end-to-end vector, which follows a power law behavior with exponent $3/2$. We also provide a scaling relation between the radius of gyration and the chain length, and the exponent decreases significantly in the presence of chiral active forces.

Title: Spin valve effect in junctions with a single ferromagnet
Authors: Fengrui Yao, Volodymyr Multian, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ignacio Gutierrez Lezama, Alberto F. Morpurgo
Abstract: Spin valves are essential components in spintronic memory devices, whose conductance is modulated by controlling spin-polarized electron tunneling through the alignment of the magnetization in ferromagnetic elements. Whereas conventional spin valves unavoidably require at least two ferromagnetic elements, here we demonstrate a van der Waals spin valve based on a tunnel junction that comprises only one such ferromagnetic layer. Our devices combine a Fe3GeTe2 electrode acting as spin injector together with a paramagnetic tunnel barrier, formed by a CrBr3 multilayer operated above its Curie temperature. We show that these devices exhibit a conductance modulation with values comparable to that of conventional spin valves. A quantitative analysis of the magnetoconductance that accounts for the field-induced magnetization of CrBr3, and that includes the effect of exchange interaction, confirms that the spin valve effect originates from the paramagnetic response of the barrier, in the absence of spontaneous magnetization in CrBr3.

Title: Theory of Photocurrent and High-Harmonic Generation with Chiral Fermions
Authors: Yuya Ominato, Masahito Mochizuki
Abstract: We theoretically discover possible dc-current induction and high-harmonic generation from photodriven chiral fermions in B20-type semimetals irradiated with circularly polarized light as nonlinear optical responses with several unconventional properties. First, we find multiple sign changes of the induced bulk dc photocurrent as a function of light parameters, which is ascribed to the nature of asymmetric photon-dressed bands in chiral systems. Moreover, we observe a parity-dependent directivity of high-harmonic generation where the odd- and even-order harmonics have intensities only in directions perpendicular and parallel to the polarization plane, respectively, which can be understood from dynamical symmetry of the present photodriven chiral systems.

Title: Spin injection and detection in all-van der Waals 2D devices
Authors: Jan BÃ¤renfÃ¤nger, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jonathan Eroms, Dieter Weiss, Mariusz Ciorga
Abstract: In this work we report efficient out-of-plane spin injection and detection in an all-van der Waals based heterostructure using only exfoliated 2D materials. We demonstrate spin injection by measuring spin-valve and Hanle signals in non-local transport in a stack of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT), hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and graphene layers. FGT flakes form the spin aligning electrodes necessary to inject and detect spins in the graphene channel. The hBN tunnel barrier provides a high-quality interface between the ferromagnetic electrodes and graphene, eliminating the conductivity mismatch problem, thus ensuring efficient spin injection and detection with spin injection efficiencies of up to $P=40$\,\%. Our results demonstrate that FGT/hBN/graphene heterostructures form a promising platform for realizing 2D van der Waals spintronic devices.

Title: Enhanced Charge Transport in A-site Ordered Perovskite Derivatives A2A'Bi2I9 (A = Cs; A'= Ag, Cu): A First-Principles Study

Abstract: Recent experiments have synthesized Cs2AgBi2I9 by partially substituting Cs+ with Ag+ at the A-site of Cs3Bi2I9, resulting in enhanced charge transport properties compared to Cs3Bi2I9. However, the atomic-scale mechanisms behind this enhancement remain unclear. In this work, we investigate the carrier transport mechanisms in Cs2A'Bi2I9 (A' = Ag, Cu) using first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport calculations. Our results reveal that A-site ordered Cs2A'Bi2I9 exhibits carrier mobilities that are 3-4 times higher than those of Cs3Bi2I9 within the 100-500 K temperature range. We identify polar phonon scattering as the dominant mechanism limiting mobility. Furthermore, the enhanced out-of-plane carrier mobility in Cs2A'Bi2I9, particularly between 100 and 200K, leads to reduced mobility anisotropy. These improvements are mainly due to the shorter A'-I bond lengths and increased Ag+/Cu+ s-I p orbital coupling. Notably, substitution with Cu+ results in a further reduction in the band gap and enhanced hole mobility compared to Ag+ substitution in Cs3Bi2I9. Further analysis reveals that the significant increase in carrier mobility in Cs2A'Bi2I9 can be largely explained by the smaller carrier effective masses (m*) and weaker FrÃ¶hlich coupling strengths ({\alpha}), resulting in a lower polar mass {\alpha}(m*/me), compared to Cs3Bi2I9. Our study provides valuable insights into the transport properties of Bi-based perovskite derivatives, paving the way for their future applications in optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Metal-halide perovskites (MHPs) emerged as a family of novel semiconductors with outstanding optoelectronic properties for applications in photovoltaics and light emission. Recently, they also attract interest as promising candidates for spintronics. In materials lacking inversion symmetry, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) leads to the Rashba-Dresselhaus effect, offering a pathway for spin current control. Therefore, inversion symmetry breaking in MHPs, which are characterized by strong SOC, has crucial implications. Yet, in complex low-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), the presence of and structural contributions to inversion symmetry breaking remain elusive. Here, employing intense THz fields, we coherently drive lattice dynamics carrying spectroscopic fingerprints of inversion symmetry breaking in Ruddlesden-Popper (PEA)$_2$(MA)$_{n-1}$PbnI${3n+1}$ perovskites, which are globally assigned to a centrosymmetric space group. We demonstrate coherent control by THz pulses over specific phonons, which we assign to either purely inorganic or highly anharmonic hybrid cage-ligand vibrations. By developing a general polarization analysis for THz-driven phonons, we pinpoint linear and nonlinear driving mechanisms. From this, we identify simultaneous IR- and Raman-activity of inorganic cage modes below 1.5 THz, indicating mode-selective inversion symmetry breaking. By exploring the driving pathways of these coherent phonons, we lay the groundwork for simultaneous ultrafast control of optoelectronic and spintronic properties in 2D HOIPs.

Title: Twist deformation of physical trefoil knots
Authors: Taiki Goto, Shunsuke Nomura, Tomohiko G. Sano
Abstract: Knots across various length scales, from micro to macro-scales, such as polymers, DNA, shoelaces, and surgery, serving their unique mechanical properties. The shape of ideal knots has been extensively studied in the context of knot theory, while that of physical knots has been discussed very recently. The complex interplay of elasticity and geometry, such as bending, twisting, and contact, needs to be disentangled to predict their deformation. Still, the unified understanding of the deformation of physical knots is insufficient. Here, we focus on the trefoil knot, a closed knot with a nontrivial topology, and study the relationship between the shapes of the trefoil knot and applied physical twists, combining experiments and simulations. As we twist the elastomeric rod, the knot becomes either tightened or loosened, preserving the original three-fold symmetry, and then buckles and exhibits symmetry breaking at critical angles. The curvature profiles computed through the X-ray tomography analysis also exhibit similar symmetry breaking. The transition would be triggered by the mechanical instability, where the imposed twist energy is converted into the bending energy. The phase transition observed here is analogous to the classical buckling phenomena of elastic rings known as the Michell instability. We find that the twist buckling instability of the trefoil knot results from the interplay of bending, twisting, and contact properties of the rod. In other words, the buckling of the knot is predictable based on the elasticity and geometry of rods, which would be useful in avoiding or even utilizing their buckling in practical engineering applications such as surgery and the shipping industry.

Title: Systematic Mapping of Altermagnetic Magnons by Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Circular Dichroism
Authors: Nikolaos Biniskos, Manuel dos Santos Dias, Stefano Agrestini, David SvitÃ¡k, Ke-Jin Zhou, JiÅÃ­ PospÃ­Å¡il, Petr ÄermÃ¡k
Abstract: Altermagnets, a unique class of magnetic materials that combines features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, have garnered attention for their potential in spintronics and magnonics. While the electronic properties of altermagnets have been well studied, characterizing their magnon excitations is essential for fully understanding their behavior and enabling practical device applications. In this work, we introduce a measurement protocol combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) with circular polarization and azimuthal scanning to probe the chiral nature of the altermagnetic split magnon modes in CrSb. This approach circumvents the challenges posed by domain averaging in macroscopic samples, allowing for precise measurements of the polarization and energy of the magnons in individual antiferromagnetic domains. Our findings demonstrate a pronounced circular dichroism in the magnon peaks, with an azimuthal dependence that directly confirms the theoretical predictions. By establishing a reliable and accessible method for probing altermagnetic magnons, this work opens new avenues for fundamental studies of these collective excitations and for developing next-generation magnonic device applications.

Title: Comparison of various UHMWPE formulations from contemporary total knee replacements before and after accelerated aging
Authors: Petr Fulin, Veronika Gajdosova, Ivana Sloufova, Jiri Hodan, David Pokorny, Miroslav Slouf
Abstract: We have collected 21 different formulations of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which have been employed as liners in contemporary total knee replacements (TKR). The UHMWPE liners were bought from the most important manufacturers on the orthopedic market in the Czech Republic as of 2020. The collected liners represented a broad range of both traditional and modern UHMWPE formulations, which differed by the level of crosslinking, type of thermal treatment, sterilization and/or stabilization. All obtained UHMWPE's were characterized by multiple methods immediately after purchase and after the accelerated aging in H2O2. The experimental results (oxidative degradation, structure changes, and micromechanical properties) were correlated with manufacture's data (crosslinking, thermal treatment, sterilization, and stabilization). The investigated UHMWPE liners exhibited significant differences in their properties, namely in their resistance to long term oxidative degradation. The stiffness-related mechanical properties showed a strong correlation with the overall crystallinity. The crystallinity depended mostly on the oxidative degradation of the UHMWPE liners, while the thermal treatment played a minor role. The highest resistance to oxidation and wear, which promises the best in vivo performance, was found for the crosslinked UHMWPE formulations with biocompatible stabilizers (such as alpha-tocopherol, which is the key component of vitamin E).

Title: Tunable Thermal Conductivity and Mechanical Properties of Metastable Silicon by Phase Engineering
Authors: Yubing Du, Guoshuai Du, Zhixi Zhu, Jiaohui Yan, Jiayin Li, Tiansong Zhang, Lina Yang, Ke Jin, Yabin Chen
Abstract: The extensive applications of cubic silicon in flexible transistors and infrared detectors are much hindered by its intrinsic properties. Metastable silicon phases, such as Si-III, IV and XII prepared using extreme pressure method, provide a unique "genetic bank" with diverse structures and exotic characteristics, however, exploration on their inherent physical properties remains immature. Herein, we demonstrate the phase engineering strategy to modulate the thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of metastable silicon. The thermal conductivity obtained via Raman optothermal approach presents the broad tunability across various Si-I, III, XII and IV phases. The hardness and Young's modulus of Si-IV are remarkably greater than those of Si-III/XII mixture, confirmed by nanoindentation technique. Moreover, it was found that the pressure-induced structural defects can substantially degrade the thermal and mechanical properties of silicon. This systematic investigation can offer feasible route to design novel semiconductors and further advance their desirable applications in advanced nanodevices and mechanical transducers.

Title: Controlling the microscopic quantum pathways for ultrafast charge transfer in van der Waals heterostructures
Authors: Niklas Hofmann, Johannes Gradl, Leonard Weigl, Stiven Forti, Camilla Coletti, Isabella Gierz
Abstract: Efficient charge separation in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is crucial for optimizing light-harvesting and detection applications. However, precise control over the microscopic pathways governing ultrafast charge transfer remains an open challenge. These pathways are intrinsically linked to charge transfer states with strongly delocalized wave functions that appear at various momenta in the Brillouin zone. Here, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) to investigate the possibility of steering carriers through specific charge transfer states in a prototypical WS2-graphene heterostructure. By selectively exciting electron-hole pairs at the K-point and close to the Q-point of WS2 with different pump photon energies, we find that charge separation is faster at higher excitation energies. We attribute this to distinct tunneling mechanisms dictated by the momentum where the initial excitation takes place. Our findings introduce a novel strategy for controlling charge transfer dynamics in vdW heterostructures, paving the way for more efficient optoelectronic devices.

Title: Interaction induced Anderson transition in a kicked one dimensional Bose gas
Authors: Hazel Olsen, Pierre Devillard, Gianni Aupetit-Diallo, Patrizia Vignolo, Mathias Albert
Abstract: We investigate the Lieb-Liniger model of one-dimensional bosons subjected to periodic kicks. In both the non-interacting and strongly interacting limits, the system undergoes dynamical localization, leading to energy saturation at long times. However, for finite interactions, we reveal an interaction-driven transition from an insulating to a metallic phase at a critical kicking strength, provided the number of particles is three or more. Using the Bethe Ansatz solution of the Lieb-Liniger gas, we establish a formal correspondence between its dynamical evolution and an Anderson model in $N$ spatial dimensions, where $N$ is the number of particles. This theoretical prediction is supported by extensive numerical simulations for three particles, complemented by finite-time scaling analysis, demonstrating that this transition belongs to the orthogonal Anderson universality class.

Title: Dual Optical Hyperbolicity of PdCoO2 and PdCrO2 Delafossite Single Crystals
Authors: Salvatore Macis, Annalisa DArco, Eugenio Del Re, Lorenzo Mosesso, Maria Chiara Paolozzi, Vincenzo Stagno, Alexander McLeod, Yu Tao, Pahuni Jain, Yi Zhang, Fred Tutt, Marco Centini, Maria Cristina Larciprete, Chris Leighton, Stefano Lupi
Abstract: Hyperbolic materials exhibit a very peculiar optical anisotropy with simultaneously different signs of the dielectric tensor components. This anisotropy allows the propagation of exotic surface-wave excitations like hyperbolic phonons and plasmon polaritons. While hyperbolic materials hold promise for applications in subwavelength photonics and enhanced light-matter interactions, their natural occurrence is limited to few materials, often accompanied by significant dielectric losses and limited hyperbolic spectral bandwidth. Focusing on PdCoO2 and PdCrO2 delafossite transition-metal oxides, in this paper we demonstrate their unique dual hyperbolic regimes: one localized around a phonon absorption in the mid-infrared spectral region, and the other extending into the visible range. Both hyperbolic regimes show exceptional properties including low dissipation and high hyperbolic quality factors. These results pave the way for innovative applications of delafossite layered metals in subwavelength photonics, imaging, and sensing.

Title: Symmetrical bipolar electrobending deformation in acceptor-doped piezoceramics
Authors: Yi Cheng, Shuo Tian, Bin Li, Yejing Dai
Abstract: Since 2022, large apparent strains (>1%) with highly asymmetrical strain-electric field (S-E) curves have been reported in various thin piezoceramic materials, attributed to a bidirectional electric-field-induced bending (electrobending) deformation, which consistently produces convex bending along the negative electric field direction. In this study, we report a novel unidirectional electrobending behavior in acceptor-doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3 ceramics, where convex bending always occurs along the pre-poling direction regardless of the direction of the applied electric field. This unique deformation is related to the reorientation of the defect dipoles in one surface layer during the pre-poling process, resulting in an asymmetrical distribution of defect dipoles in the two surface layers. The synergistic interaction between ferroelectric domains and defect dipoles in the surface layers induces this unidirectional electrobending, as evidenced by a butterfly-like symmetrical bipolar S-E curve with a giant apparent strain of 3.2%. These findings provide new insights into defect engineering strategies for developing advanced piezoelectric materials with large electroinduced displacements.

Title: Visualizing the breakdown of the quantum anomalous Hall effect
Authors: George M. Ferguson, Run Xiao, Anthony R. Richardella, Austin Kaczmarek, Nitin Samarth, Katja C. Nowack
Abstract: The creation of topologically non-trivial matter across electronic, mechanical, cold-atom, and photonic platforms is advancing rapidly, yet understanding the breakdown of topological protection remains a major challenge. In this work, we use magnetic imaging combined with global electrical transport measurements to visualize the current-induced breakdown of the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in a magnetically doped topological insulator. We find that dissipation emerges at localized hot spots near electrical contacts, where an abrupt change in Hall angle leads to significant distortions of the current density. Using the local magnetization as a proxy for electron temperature, we directly observe that the electrons are driven out of equilibrium with the lattice at the hot spots and throughout the device in the breakdown regime. By characterizing energy relaxation processes in our device, we show that the breakdown of quantization is governed entirely by electron heating, and that a vanishing thermal relaxation strength at millikelvin temperatures limits the robustness of the QAHE. Our findings provide a framework for diagnosing energy relaxation in topological materials and will guide realizing robust topological protection in magnetic topological insulators.

Title: Amorphous to Crystalline Transformation: How Cluster Aggregation Drives the Multistep Nucleation of ZIF-8

Abstract: Nucleation, the pivotal first step of crystallization, governs essential characteristics of crystallization products, including size distribution, morphology, and polymorphism. While understanding this process is paramount to the design of chemical, pharmaceutical and industrial production processes, major knowledge gaps remain, especially with respect to the crystallization of porous solids. Also for nanocrystalline ZIF-8, one of the most widely studied metal-organic frameworks, questions regarding the species involved in the nucleation pathway and their structural and chemical transformations remain unanswered. By combining harmonic light scattering, inherently sensitive to structural changes, with NMR spectroscopy, which reveals molecular exchanges between particles and solution, we were able to capture the crystallization mechanism of ZIF-8 in unprecedented detail. This dual approach provides concurrent structural and chemical insights, revealing key processes not previously observed in ZIF crystallization. Upon mixing small charged prenucleation clusters (PNCs) are formed, exhibiting an excess of ligands and net positive charge. We show that nucleation is initiated by aggregation of PNCs, through the release of ligands and associated protons to the liquid. This leads to the formation of charge neutral amorphous precursor particles (APPs) which incorporate neutral monomers from solution, and crystallize ZIF-8. Our work highlights chemical dynamics as a vital, yet often overlooked, dimension in the multi-stage structural evolution of MOFs. By establishing the critical role of PNCs in the nucleation of ZIF-8, new pathways open up for controlling crystallization of metal-organic frameworks through targeted chemical interactions with these species.

Title: Quantum Phases for Finite-Temperature Gases of Bosonic Polar Molecules Shielded by Dual Microwaves
Authors: Wei Zhang, Kun Chen, Su Yi, Tao Shi
Abstract: We investigate the finite-temperature phase diagram of polar molecules shielded by dual microwave fields using the path integral Monte Carlo method combined with the worm algorithm. We determine the critical temperature $T_c$ for Bose-Einstein condensations (BECs) and identify two distinct phases below $T_c$: the expanding gas (EG) phase and the self-bound gas (SBG) phase. We further analyze the temperature and interaction-strength dependence of the condensate and superfluid fractions. Notably, in contrast to dilute atomic BECs, the SBG phase displays a low condensate fraction and a high superfluid fraction, resembling the behavior of strongly correlated $^4$He superfluids. These significant many-body correlations arise from the interplay between long-range dipole-dipole interactions and the short-range shielding potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the aspect ratio of the gas provides a characteristic geometric signature to accurately determine the EG-to-SBG transition, robust against external trapping potentials. Our findings provide unbiased and numerically exact results to guide upcoming experiments with polar molecules.

Title: Identifying two-dimensional topological phase transition by entanglement spectrum : A fermion Monte Carlo study
Authors: Weilun Jiang, Xiaofan Luo, Bin-Bin Mao, Zheng Yan
Abstract: Among many types of quantum entanglement properties, the entanglement spectrum provides more abundant information than other observables. Exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group method could handle the system in one-dimension properly, while in higher dimension, it exceeds the capacity of the algorithms. To expand the ability of existing numerical methods, we takes a different approach via quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. By exploiting particle number and spin symmetry, we realize an efficient algorithms to solve the entanglement spectrum in the interacting fermionic system. Taking two-dimensional interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger as example, we verify the existence of topological phase transition under different types of many-body interactions. The calculated particle number distribution and wave-function of entanglement Hamiltonian indicate that the two belong distinct types of topological phase transitions.

Title: Four regimes of primary radiation damage in tungsten
Authors: Jesper ByggmÃ¤star, Ville-Markus Yli-Suutala, Aslak Fellman, Jan ÃstrÃ¶m, Jan Westerholm, Fredric Granberg
Abstract: We observe for the first time in silico the transition to a linear regime in the primary damage production in tungsten. As the critical plasma-facing material in fusion reactors, radiation damage in tungsten has been studied extensively in experiments and simulations. Irradiation experiments routinely produce recoils in the MeV range while full atomistic modelling has been limited to a few hundred keV. Here we bridge these scales with extremely large-scale and accurate machine-learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations with recoil energies up to 2 MeV in systems up to one billion atoms. We reveal four regimes of primary damage as a function of damage energy, with a transition to a high-energy regime that deviates from all previous models. Curiously, the start of the high-energy regime coincides with the highest possible recoil energy to tungsten atoms from fusion-emitted neutrons (300 keV).

Title: Flat band driven itinerant magnetism in the Co-pnictides (La,Ca)Co$_2$(As,P)$_2$
Authors: D. Subires, M. GarcÃ­a-DÃ­ez, A. Kar, C.-Y. Lim, Victoria M. Li, V. Yannello, Dina Carbone, P. Gargiani, T. Yilmaz, J. Dai, M. Tallarida, E. Vescovo, M. Shatruk, Maia G. Vergniory, S. Blanco-Canosa
Abstract: Flat bands can induce strong electron correlation effects that help stabilize both magnetic and superconducting states. Here, we carry out angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to study the electronic structure of the Co-pnictides CaCo$_2$As$_2$ and LaCo$_2$P$_2$. We find that, while the $k_z$ Fermi topology of ferromagnetic LaCo$_2$P$_2$ is markedly 2-dimensional, antiferromagnetic CaCo$_2$As$_2$ develops a 3D Fermi surface described by a $zig-zag$-like band dispersion perpendicular to the Co-As plane. Furthermore, the magnetism is driven by the electronic correlations of the flat bands with $d_{xy}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbital character at the Fermi level. Our results link the electronic dimensionality and the magnetic order, and emphasize the critical role of the As-As and P-P bond strength along the $c$-direction to understand the electronic band structure and the rich phase diagram of transition metal pnictides.

Title: New investigation of the electronic and structural properties of (Mg,Ti)-doped and co-doped ZnO structures: A DFT and DFT+U study
Authors: Sidi Ahmedbowba, Fehmi Khadri, Walid Ouerghui, Said Ridene
Abstract: This study investigates the novelty of the crystalline and electronic structure of (Mg,Ti)-doped ZnO and the co-doped Zn1-x-yMgxTiyO structures using Gaussian and plane-wave basis sets, as implemented in the CP2K code. The goal of incorporating low concentration of Mg and Ti into ZnO is to influence its electronic properties without significantly altering its geometrical and crystalline structure. Within the framework of density functional theory (DFT), we analyze various doped and co-doped configurations. Our results show that Ti-doped ZnO exhibits an indirect band gap, while Mg doping preserves the direct semiconductor behavior of ZnO structure, with an increase in band gap energy. Additionally, the co-doped Zn1-x-yMgxTiyO system, at varying concentrations of Ti and Mg, displays minimal lattice deformation. These findings suggest that this material could be a promising candidate for transparent electronic devices, highlighting the importance of understanding the electronic structure of ZnO to optimize its physical properties.

Title: Micro/nanoscale spacers for enhanced thermophotovoltaic and thermionic energy conversion: a comprehensive review
Authors: Nicolas A Loubet, Katie Bezdjian, Esther Lopez, Alejandro Datas
Abstract: Thermionics and thermophotovoltaics are solid-state technologies that convert high-temperature heat into electricity by utilizing fundamental particles, electrons in thermionics and photons in thermophotovoltaics, as energy carriers. Both systems have the potential to achieve high efficiency and power density, contingent on the optimization of radiative/electronic energy fluxes. A critical factor in enhancing energy flux in these devices is the introduction of microscale (thermionics) or nanoscale (thermophotovoltaics) gaps between the hot thermal emitter and the cooler receiver. In thermionic converters, microscale gaps mitigate space charge effects that create energy barriers to electron flow. For thermophotovoltaic systems, nanoscale gaps facilitate photon tunneling, significantly boosting photon flux towards the thermophotovoltaic cell. Forming these small-scale gaps often necessitates intermediate materials or spacers between the emitter and receiver. Over the past few decades, various spacer designs have been proposed and studied, demonstrating their effectiveness in enhancing energy transfer and conversion. However, challenges remain regarding their reliability and scalability. This article provides a comprehensive overview of spacer technologies for thermionics and thermophotovoltaics and summarizes recent advancements, current capabilities, and persistent challenges.

Title: Melting of devil's staircases in the long-range Dicke-Ising model
Authors: Jan Alexander Koziol, Anja Langheld, Kai Phillip Schmidt
Abstract: We present quantum phase diagrams for the antiferromagnetic long-range Ising model with a linear coupling to a single bosonic mode on the square and triangular lattice. For zero coupling, the ground-state magnetization forms a devil's staircase structure of magnetization plateaux as a function of a longitudinal field. Apart from a paramagnetic superradiant phase with a finite photon density at strong light-matter couplings, the long-range interactions lead to a plethora of intermediate phases that break the translational symmetry and have a finite photon density at the same time. We apply an adaption of the unit-cell-based mean-field calculations, which captures all possible magnetic unit cells up to a chosen extent. Further, we exploit an exact mapping of the non-superradiant phases to an effective Dicke model to calculate upper bounds for phase transitions towards superradiant phases. Finally, to treat quantum fluctuations in a quantitative fashion, we employ a generalized wormhole quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. We discuss how these three methods are used in a cooperative fashion. In the calculated phase diagrams we see several features arising from the long-range interactions: The devil's staircases of distinct magnetically ordered normal phases and non-trivial magnetically ordered superradiant phases beyond the findings for nearest-neighbor interactions. Examples are a superradiant phase with a three-sublattice magnetic order on the square lattice and the superradiant Wigner crystal with four sites per unit cell on the triangular lattice. We find the transition between normal and superradiant phases with the same (different) magnetic order to be of second order with Dicke universality (first order). Further, between superradiant phases we find first-order phase transitions, besides specially highlighted regimes for which we find indications for second-order behavior.

Title: Topological Phases in Fractals: Local Spin Chern Marker in the Sierpinski carpet Kane-Mele-Rashba Model
Authors: L. L. Lage, A. B. FÃ©lix, S. dos A. Sousa-JÃºnior, A. LatgÃ©, Tarik P. Cysne
Abstract: We study the spectral properties and local topology of the Kane-Mele-Rashba model on a Sierpinski Carpet (SC) fractal, constructed from a rectangular flake with an underlying honeycomb arrangement and open boundary conditions. When the system parameters correspond to a topologically trivial phase, the energy spectrum is characterized solely by bulk states that are not significantly modified by the system's fractality. For parameters corresponding to the quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, in addition to bulk states, the energy spectrum exhibits in-gap topological states that are strongly influenced by the fractal geometry. As the fractal generation increases, the in-gap topological states acquire a staircase profile, which translates into sharp peaks in the density of states. We also show that both the QSHI and the trivial phase exhibit a large gap in the valence-projected spin spectrum, allowing the use of the local spin Chern marker (LSCM) to index the local topology of the system. Fractality does not affect this gap, allowing the application of LSCM to higher fractal generations. Our results explore the LSCM versatility, showing its potential to access local topology in complex geometries such as fractal systems.

Title: Topotactic Growth of Zintl Phase Eu$_5$In$_2$As$_6$ Nanowires with Antiferromagnetic Behavior
Authors: Man Suk Song, Lothar Houben, Nadav Rothem, Ambikesh Gupta, Shai Rabkin, Beena Kalisky, Haim Beidenkopf, Hadas Shtrikman
Abstract: We demonstrate a topotactic transformation of zincblende InAs(Sb) nanowires into the Zintl phase Eu$_5$In$_2$As$_6$ through a vapor-solid mutual exchange process involving Eu and In in molecular beam epitaxy. This conversion preserves the polyhedral coordination lattice of the parent InAs(Sb) structure while inducing orthorhombic symmetry in the product phase, Eu$_5$In$_2$As$_6$, in which quasi-one-dimensional [InAs$_3$]$^6$$^-$ chains with tetrahedral sites align along the <110> direction of the zincblende structure. Local and global magnetic characterization identified two distinct antiferromagnetic phase transitions at approximately 7 K and 16 K in Eu$_5$In$_2$As$_6$ nanowires, potentially classified as altermagnetic phases. The versatility of the topotactic conversion of III-V semiconductor nanowires provides a platform for designing functional Zintl materials with tunable magnetic properties, making them promising candidates for spintronic applications.

Title: Selective electron-phonon coupling strength from nonequilibrium optical spectroscopy: The case of MgB$_2$
Authors: S. Mor, F. Boschini, E. Razzoli, M. Zonno, M. Michiardi, G. Levy, N.D. Zhigadlo, P.C. Canfield, G. Cerullo, A. Damascelli, C. Giannetti, S. Dal Conte
Abstract: The coupling between quasiparticles and bosonic excitations rules the energy transfer pathways in condensed matter systems. The possibility of inferring the strength of specific coupling channels from their characteristic time scales measured in nonequilibrium experiments is still an open question. Here, we investigate MgB$_2$, in which conventional superconductivity at temperatures as high as 39 K is mediated by the strong coupling between the conduction electrons and the E$_{2g}$ phonon mode. By means of broadband time-resolved optical spectroscopy, we show that this selective electron-phonon coupling dictates the nonequilibrium optical response of MgB$_2$ at early times (<100 fs) after photoexcitation. Furthermore, based on an effective temperature model analysis, we estimate its contribution to the total electron-boson coupling function extracted from complementary equilibrium spectroscopy approaches, namely optical reflectivity and ARPES. The coupling strength with the E$_{2g}$ phonon modes is thus estimated to be $\lambda$ ~ 0.56, which is approximately half of the total coupling constant, in agreement with ab-initio calculations from the literature. As a benchmark, broadband time-resolved optical spectroscopy is performed also on the isostructural and non-superconducting compound AlB$_2$, showing that the nonequilibrium optical response relaxes on a slower timescale due to the lack of strongly-coupled phonon modes. Our findings demonstrate the possibility to resolve and quantify selective electron-phonon coupling from nonequilibrium optical spectroscopy.

Title: Elastic Pseudoturbulence in Polymer Solutions
Authors: Mithun Ravisankar, Roberto Zenit
Abstract: We study the effects of polymer additives on pseudoturbulence induced by a swarm of bubbles rising in a quiescent fluid. We find that, beyond a critical polymer concentration, the energy spectra of velocity fluctuations in bubble-induced turbulence decay more steeply with respect to the wavenumber $k$. This new scaling is significantly steeper than the classical $k^{-3}$ scaling observed for bubbles in Newtonian fluids; it is independent of the gas volume fraction in the inertial limit and occurs within the length scales between the bubble wake length and the bubble diameter. Furthermore, we provide strong evidence that the presence of polymers enhances the coherence of the flow, highlighting the significant role of polymer additives in modifying the characteristics of pseudoturbulence.

Title: Ground State of $\mathrm{SU}\left(3\right)$ spin model on the checkerboard lattice
Authors: Junhao Zhang, Jie Hou, Jie Lou, Yan Chen
Abstract: Geometric frustration in quantum spin systems can lead to exotic ground states. In this study, we investigate the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ spin model on the checkerboard lattice to explore the effects of frustration arising from its point-connected $(N+1)$-site local structure. We employ density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and exact diagonalization (ED) techniques to determine the ground state properties. Our results reveal the absence of both 3-sublattice antiferromagnetic order and valence cluster solid order. Instead, we identify ground states with bond stripe patterns sensitive to boundary conditions and system size, comprising staggered singlet arrays and uniform flat stripes. Notably, these stripes are relatively decoupled, and similar patterns can be reconstructed in quasi-one-dimensional ladders. These findings suggest that geometric frustration drives the system toward a mixed phase, combining characteristics of spin-liquid and valence cluster solid states, providing new insights into the behavior of frustrated quantum spin systems.

Title: Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes
Authors: Ankit Singh, Vinay Vaibhav, Timothy W. Sirk, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.

Title: Magnetoelectric Control of Helical Light Emission in a MoirÃ© Chern Magnet
Authors: Eric Anderson, Heonjoon Park, Kaijie Yang, Jiaqi Cai, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Liang Fu, Ting Cao, Di Xiao, Xiaodong Xu
Abstract: Magnetoelectric effects and their coupling to light helicity are important for both fundamental science and applications in sensing, communication, and data storage. Traditional approaches require complex device architectures, involving separate spin-injection, ferromagnetic, and optically active layers. Recently, the emergence of 2D semiconductor moirÃ© superlattices with flat Chern bands and strong light-matter interactions has established a simple yet powerful platform for exploring the coupling between photon, electron, and spin degrees of freedom. Here, we report efficient current control of spontaneous ferromagnetism and associated helicity of light emission in moirÃ© MoTe2 bilayer - a system which hosts a rich variety of topological phases, including newly discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulators. We show that the current control is effective over a wide range of doping of the first moirÃ© Chern band, implying the uniformity of the Berry curvature distribution over the flat band. By setting the system into the anomalous Hall metal phase, a current as small as 10nA is sufficient to switch the magnetic order, a substantial improvement over both conventional spin torque architectures and other moirÃ© systems. The realized current control of ferromagnetism leads to continuous tuning of trion photoluminescence helicity from left to right circular via spin/valley Hall torque at zero magnetic field. Our results pave the way for topological opto-spintronics based on semiconductors with synthetic flat Chern bands.

Title: Microwave Microscope Studies of Trapped Vortex Dynamics in Superconductors
Authors: Chung-Yang Wang, Steven M. Anlage
Abstract: Trapped vortices in superconductors introduce residual resistance in superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities and disrupt the operation of superconducting quantum and digital electronic circuits. Understanding the detailed dynamics of trapped vortices under oscillating magnetic fields is essential for advancing these technologies. We have developed a near-field magnetic microwave microscope to study the dynamics of a limited number of trapped vortices under the probe when stimulated by a localized rf magnetic field. By measuring the local second-harmonic response ($P_\mathrm{2f}$) at sub-femto-Watt levels, we isolate signals exclusively arising from trapped vortices, excluding contributions from surface defects and Meissner screening currents. Toy models of Niobium superconductor hosting vortex pinning sites are introduced and studied with Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations of probe/sample interaction to better understand the measured second-harmonic response. The simulation results demonstrate that the second-harmonic response of trapped vortex motion under a localized rf magnetic field shares key features with the experimental data. This measurement technique provides access to vortex dynamics at the micron scale, such as depinning events and spatially-resolved pinning properties, as demonstrated in measurements on a Niobium film with an antidot flux pinning array.

Title: Polycrystalline Morphology and Anomalous Hall Effect in RF-Sputtered Co2MnGa Films
Authors: Carter E. Wade, Sunny Phan, Katherine Coffin, Gabe Paynter, Ty J. Cawein, Kurt G. Eyink, Andrei Kogan, Joseph P. Corbett
Abstract: The Heusler compound Co2MnGa is a topological semimetal with intriguing electronic and magnetic properties, making it a promising candidate for spintronic applications. This study systematically investigates the effects of substrate temperature and RF sputtering power on the structure, morphology, and anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in Co2MnGa thin films. Using X-ray diffraction line analysis, we identify variations in film orientation and crystallinity, revealing the emergence of high-index textures at specific growth conditions. Atomic force microscopy imaging provide insight into grain morphology and size distributions demonstrating a correlation between deposition parameters and film texture. Hall transport measurements confirm a strong dependence of AHE on growth conditions, exhibiting a non-monotonic relationship with RF power and temperature. Despite significant variations in microstructure, a striking linear relationship between AHE and the zero-field slope of the Hall resistivity is observed, suggesting an underlying universal mechanism. These findings provide a foundation for investigating the complex interplay of CMG thin film conditions and transport for next-generation magnetic and electronic devices.

Title: Critical Dynamics in Short-Range Quadratic Hamiltonians
Authors: Miroslav Hopjan, Lev Vidmar
Abstract: We investigate critical transport and the dynamical exponent through the spreading of an initially localized particle in quadratic Hamiltonians with short-range hopping in lattice dimension $d_l$. We consider critical dynamics that emerges when the Thouless time, i.e., the saturation time of the mean-squared displacement, approaches the typical Heisenberg time. We establish a relation, $z=d_l/d_s$, linking the critical dynamical exponent $z$ to $d_l$ and to the spectral fractal dimension $d_s$. This result has notable implications: it says that superdiffusive transport in $d_l\geq 2$ and diffusive transport in $d_l\geq 3$ cannot be critical in the sense defined above. Our findings clarify previous results on disordered and quasiperiodic models and, through Fibonacci potential models in two and three dimensions, provide non-trivial examples of critical dynamics in systems with $d_l\neq1$ and $d_s\neq1$.

Title: A Comprehensive Computational Photovoltaic Study of Lead-free Inorganic NaSnCl$_3$-based Perovskite Solar Cell: Effect of Charge Transport Layers and Material Parameters
Authors: Md Tashfiq Bin Kashem, Sadia Anjum Esha
Abstract: Lead-free all-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising alternative to toxic lead-based solar cells and organic solar cells, which have limited stability. This work explores such a PSC with sodium tin chloride (NaSnCl$_3$) as the absorber, due to its significant potential for optoelectronic applications. To investigate this potential, a comprehensive computational analysis of NaSnCl$_3$-based solar cells is performed using the one-dimensional solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS -1D). Simulations are performed for device structures with front contact/Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)/electron transport layer (ETL)/NaSnCl$_3$/hole transport layer (HTL)/back contact configuration, where TiO$_2$, SnS$_2$, IGZO, ZnSe, CdS, GaSe, ZnSnN$_2$, WS$_2$, PCBM, STO, and CSTO are utilized as ETLs and CNTS, GO, Mg-CuCrO$_2$, Spiro-OMeTAD, CdTe, GaAs, MoTe$_2$, BaSi$_2$, and P3HT are utilized as HTLs. Based on the obtained power conversion efficiency (PCE), six best ETL-HTL combinations with SnS$_2$, STO, WS$_2$, IGZO, ZnSe and CSTO as ETLs and MoTe$_2$ as HTL are chosen for further analysis. The effects of different material and device parameters, such as thickness and doping density; effective density of states; bulk and interface defects; series and shunt resistance; and operating conditions, such as temperature and light intensity are investigated. Using the optimized material parameters, SnS$_2$ ETL and MoTe$_2$ HTL-based solar cell show the best performance with open circuit voltage, Voc = 1.196V, short circuit current density, Jsc = 35.82 mA/cm$^2$, fill factor, FF = 89.72% and PCE = 38.42%. This detailed study provides valuable insights for the fabrication of high efficiency NaSnCl$_3$-based solar cells.

Title: Steady-state dynamical mean field theory based on influence functional matrix product states
Authors: Mithilesh Nayak, Julian Thoenniss, Michael Sonner, Dmitry A. Abanin, Philipp Werner
Abstract: We implement the recently developed influence functional matrix product states approach as impurity solver in equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) calculations of the single-band Hubbard model. The method yields numerically exact descriptions of metallic states without sharp spectral features, at a moderate numerical cost. Systems with narrow quasiparticle or spin-polaron peaks, as well as low-temperature Mott insulators provide more challenges, since these simulations require long time contours or high bond dimensions. A promising field of application is the DMFT simulation of nonequilibrium steady states, which we demonstrate with results for photo-doped Mott systems with long-lived doublon and holon populations.

Title: Large-Angle Convergent-Beam Electron Diffraction Patterns via Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
Authors: Joseph. J Webb, Rudolf A. RÃ¶mer
Abstract: We show how generative machine learning can be used for the rapid computation of strongly dynamical electron diffraction directly from crystal structures, specifically in large-angle convergent-beam electron diffraction (LACBED) patterns. We find that a conditional generative adversarial network can learn the connection between the projected potential from a cubic crystal's unit cell and the corresponding LACBED pattern. Our model can generate diffraction patterns on a GPU many orders of magnitude faster than existing direct simulation methods. Furthermore, our approach can accurately retrieve the projected potential from diffraction patterns, opening a new approach for the inverse problem of determining crystal structure.

Title: Anticoncentration in Clifford Circuits and Beyond: From Random Tensor Networks to Pseudo-Magic States
Authors: Beatrice Magni, Alexios Christopoulos, Andrea De Luca, Xhek Turkeshi
Abstract: Anticoncentration describes how an ensemble of quantum states spreads over the allowed Hilbert space, leading to statistically uniform output probability distributions. In this work, we investigate the anticoncentration of random Clifford circuits toward the overlap distribution of random stabilizer states. Using exact analytical techniques and extensive numerical simulations based on Clifford replica tensor networks, we demonstrate that random Clifford circuits fully anticoncentrate in logarithmic circuit depth, namely higher-order moments of the overlap distribution converge to those of random stabilizer states. Moreover, we investigate the effect of introducing a controlled number of non-Clifford (magic) resources into Clifford circuits. We show that inserting a polylogarithmic in qudit number of $T$-states is sufficient to drive the overlap distribution toward the Porter-Thomas statistics, effectively recovering full quantum randomness. In short, this fact presents doped tensor networks and shallow Clifford circuits as pseudo-magic quantum states. Our results clarify the interplay between Clifford dynamics, magic resource injection, and quantum complexity, with implications for quantum circuit sampling and benchmarking of computational quantum advantage.

Title: Universal Counterdiabatic Driving
Authors: Stewart Morawetz, Anatoli Polkovnikov
Abstract: Local counterdiabatic (CD) driving provides a systematic way of constructing a control protocol to approximately suppress the excitations resulting from changing some parameter(s) of a quantum system at a finite rate. However, designing CD protocols typically requires knowledge of the original Hamiltonian a priori. In this work, we design local CD driving protocols in Krylov space using only the characteristic local time scales of the system set by e.g. phonon frequencies in materials or Rabi frequencies in superconducting qubit arrays. Surprisingly, we find that convergence of these universal protocols is controlled by the asymptotic high frequency tails of the response functions. This finding hints at a deep connection between the long-time, low frequency response of the system controlling non-adiabatic effects, and the high-frequency response determined by the short-time operator growth and the Krylov complexity, which has been elusive until now.

Title: Counterdiabatic Driving with Performance Guarantees
Authors: Jernej Rudi Finzgar, Simone Notarnicola, Madelyn Cain, Mikhail D. Lukin Mikhail, Dries Sels
Abstract: Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.

Title: Entanglement dynamics of many-body quantum states with evolving system conditions
Authors: Devanshu Shekhar, Pragya Shukla
Abstract: The entanglement analysis of a pure state of a many-body quantum system requires a prior information about its density matrix/ state matrix, obtained in principle by solving the Hamiltonian matrix. The missing information due to complexity of the many-body interactions however renders it necessary to consider an ensemble of Hamiltonians and thereby an ensemble of pure states. This in turn leaves a statistical description of the entanglement measures as the only option. We consider physical Hamiltonians that can be modelled by a multiparametric Gaussian ensembles, theoretically derive the state ensembles for its eigenstates and analyze the effect of varying system conditions on its entanglement statistics. Our approach leads to a single parametric based common mathematical formulation for the evolution of the statistics of different state ensembles. The parameter turns out to be a single functional of the system parameters and thereby reveals a deep web of connection underlying different quantum states.

Title: An accurate and robust level-set formulation for multiple junction kinetics
Authors: Tianchi Li, Marc Bernacki
Abstract: The front-capturing Level-Set (LS) method is widely employed in academia and industry to model grain boundary (GB) migration during the microstructure evolution of polycrystalline materials under thermo-mechanical treatments. During capillarity-driven grain growth, the conventional mean curvature flow equation, $\vec{v} = - \mu \gamma \kappa \vec{n}$, is used to compute the GB normal migration velocity. Over recent decades, extensive efforts have been made to incorporate polycrystalline heterogeneity into this framework. However, despite increased complexity and computational costs, these approaches have yet to achieve fully satisfactory performance. This paper introduces a simple yet robust LS formulation that accurately captures multiple junction kinetics, even with extreme GB energy ratios. Validation against existing analytical solutions highlights the method's accuracy and efficiency. This novel approach offers significant potential for advancing the study of highly heterogeneous interface systems.

Title: CrystalFramer: Rethinking the Role of Frames for SE(3)-Invariant Crystal Structure Modeling
Authors: Yusei Ito, Tatsunori Taniai, Ryo Igarashi, Yoshitaka Ushiku, Kanta Ono
Abstract: Crystal structure modeling with graph neural networks is essential for various applications in materials informatics, and capturing SE(3)-invariant geometric features is a fundamental requirement for these networks. A straightforward approach is to model with orientation-standardized structures through structure-aligned coordinate systems, or"frames." However, unlike molecules, determining frames for crystal structures is challenging due to their infinite and highly symmetric nature. In particular, existing methods rely on a statically fixed frame for each structure, determined solely by its structural information, regardless of the task under consideration. Here, we rethink the role of frames, questioning whether such simplistic alignment with the structure is sufficient, and propose the concept of dynamic frames. While accommodating the infinite and symmetric nature of crystals, these frames provide each atom with a dynamic view of its local environment, focusing on actively interacting atoms. We demonstrate this concept by utilizing the attention mechanism in a recent transformer-based crystal encoder, resulting in a new architecture called CrystalFramer. Extensive experiments show that CrystalFramer outperforms conventional frames and existing crystal encoders in various crystal property prediction tasks.

Title: Variety of Superradiant Phase Transition in Bose-Fermi System with Tight-Binding Model in the weak-coupling regime
Authors: Xing Su, Jian-Jian Cheng, Lin Zhang
Abstract: We present a full exploration of the dynamic diversity inherent in superradiant phase transitions within a one-dimensional tight-binding electronic chain that is intricately coupled to a single-mode optical cavity. By employing a quantized electromagnetic vector potential via the Peierls substitution, this gauge-coupled Bose-Fermi system facilitates momentum-dependent superradiant transitions. These transitions are characterized by the displacement of the cavity mode and the redistribution of electronic momentum, thereby circumventing the second-order spurious phase transitions typically observed in Dicke-like models. Distinct from multimode cavity QED systems with atomic gases, the single-mode optical configuration unveils a range of nonlinear phenomena, including multistability and varied spontaneous symmetry breaking. This configuration enables the precise manipulation of superradiant phases in weak coupling regimes, devoid of the quantum fluctuation divergence. Our findings advance the understanding of tunable quantum devices and highlight potential applications in quantum information processing and metrology.

Title: Hybrid confinement techniques for polariton simulators

Abstract: Exciton-polaritons in III-V semiconductor microcavities offer a robust platform for emulating complex Hamiltonians, enabling advancements in photonic applications and quantum simulation. Here, two novel fabrication techniques designed to overcome the limitations of traditional photonic confinement methods are introduced. The two distinct approaches - etch-and-oversputter (EnS) and deposit-and-oversputter (DnS) - are both based on a structured, locally elongated semiconductor cavity, leading to a deep and highly controllable spatially dependent potential. By utilizing an all-dielectric sputtered top mirror, sample iteration time, workflow complexity and expense is reduced while increasing the overall yield compared to methods such as deep ion etching. Employing a Kagome lattice and its flatband and Dirac-cone dispersions as a benchmark, high quality optical band structures are achieved, which so far have not been realized using a deep etching approach. To highlight the precise control over the lattice couplings, the eigenmodes in a two-dimensional breathing Kagome lattice are studied and polariton lasing from a zerodimensional corner mode is observed. This confirms the effectiveness of the methods presented in this paper for generating well-controlled, deep and homogeneous trapping potentials. These pave the way for fabricating intricate lattices, such as higher-order topological insulators, or on-chip quantum emitters utilizing the polariton blockade mechanism.

Title: Spatial competition and repulsion: pattern formation and the role of movement
Authors: CristÃ³bal LÃ³pez, Eduardo H. Colombo, Emilio HernÃ¡ndez-GarcÃ­a, Ricardo Martinez-Garcia
Abstract: This chapter investigates some mechanisms behind pattern formation driven by competitive-only or repelling interactions, and explores how these patterns are influenced by different types of particle movement. Despite competition and repulsion are both anti-crowding interactions, collective effects may lead to clusters of individuals, which can arrange periodically. Through the analysis of two models, it provides insights into the similarities and differences in the patterns formed and underlines the role of movement in shaping the spatial distribution of biological populations.

Title: An rf-SQUID-based traveling-wave parametric amplifier with -84 dBm input saturation power across more than one octave bandwidth
Authors: Victor Gaydamachenko, Christoph Kissling, Lukas GrÃ¼nhaupt
Abstract: Traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) have become an essential tool for the readout of quantum circuits and the search for dark matter. We report on the implementation of an rf-SQUID-based Josephson TWPA with an average saturation power of -84 dBm, while providing an average power gain of 20 dB from 3.5 to 8.5 GHz. This wide bandwidth is enabled by reducing the curvature of the dispersion in the signal band while suppressing detrimental mixing processes. With 2393 rf-SQUIDs our device has a comparable number of nonlinear elements, but achieves ten times higher saturation power than previous works, showing that using rf-SQUIDs results in a more favorable trade-off between device length and saturation power. Harnessing wideband characterization techniques we determine the TWPA's excess noise above the quantum limit to be 0.8 to 1.5 photons. In addition, we validate signal-to-noise ratio improvement as a practical measure for tuning the TWPA to minimize the total system noise, and demonstrate that its optimum does not coincide with the highest gain.

Title: Coherent backscattering and coherent forward scattering effects in variations of the random quantum kicked rotor
Authors: Hugo Thomas, Julien HÃ©braud, Bertrand Georgeot, Gabriel LemariÃ©, Christian Miniatura, Olivier Giraud
Abstract: We investigate coherent multiple scattering effects in the random quantum kicked rotor model. By changing the starting time of the Floquet period, two new classes of models can be introduced that exhibit similar interference structures. For one of the two classes, these structures appear on top of a non-trivial background, which we describe in detail. Its origin is identified and an approximate analytical formula is proposed. The asymptotic contrast profile, as well as the height of the coherent backscattering and the coherent forward scattering peaks, are also analyzed. Our findings are relevant to provide an interpretation of cold atom experiments aiming at observing such interference effects with matter waves.

Title: SAGE-Amine: Generative Amine Design with Multi-Property Optimization for Efficient CO2 Capture
Authors: Hocheol Lim, Hyein Cho, Jeonghoon Kim
Abstract: Efficient CO2 capture is vital for mitigating climate change, with amine-based solvents being widely used due to their strong reactivity with CO2. However, optimizing key properties such as basicity, viscosity, and absorption capacity remains challenging, as traditional methods rely on labor-intensive experimentation and predefined chemical databases, limiting the exploration of novel solutions. Here, SAGE-Amine was introduced, a generative modeling approach that integrates Scoring-Assisted Generative Exploration (SAGE) with quantitative structure-property relationship models to design new amines tailored for CO2 capture. Unlike conventional virtual screening restricted to existing compounds, SAGE-Amine generates novel amines by leveraging autoregressive natural language processing models trained on amine datasets. SAGE-Amine identified known amines for CO2 capture from scratch and successfully performed single-property optimization, increasing basicity or reducing viscosity or vapor pressure. Furthermore, it facilitated multi-property optimization, simultaneously achieving high basicity with low viscosity and vapor pressure. The 10 top-ranked amines were suggested using SAGE-Amine and their thermodynamic properties were further assessed using COSMO-RS simulations, confirming their potential for CO2 capture. These results highlight the potential of generative modeling in accelerating the discovery of amine solvents and expanding the possibilities for industrial CO2 capture applications.

Title: Proliferating active disks with game dynamical interaction
Authors: Alejandro AlmodÃ³var, Tobias Galla, CristÃ³bal LÃ³pez
Abstract: We study a system of self-propelled, proliferating finite-size disks with game-theoretical interactions, where growth rates depend on local population composition. We analyze how these interactions influence spatial distribution, coexistence, and extinction. Three scenarios emerge: (i) stable coexistence with well-mixed distributions, (ii) bistability, where the outcome depends on initial conditions, and (iii) dominance, where one species always outcompetes the other. We further show that activity enhances spatial mixing in coexistence and reduces extinction times in both dominance and bistability. Additionally, stronger interactions promote coexistence while accelerating extinction in the latter two regimes. By varying diffusivity, activity, and interaction strength, we show how movement and spatial constraints affect population dynamics.

Title: Extreme Terahertz Nonlinearity of AlGaN/GaN-based Grating-Gate Plasmonic Crystals

Abstract: We present a novel approach to enhance THz nonlinearity by the resonant excitation of two-dimensional plasmons in grating-gate plasmonic crystals. Using a high-electric-field THz pump-THz probe technique, we investigate the nonlinear interaction of spectrally narrow THz pulses with plasmon oscillations in a two-dimensional electron gas on an AlGaN/GaN interface integrated with metallic grating. Nonlinear effects are observed as ultrafast, pump-induced changes in THz transmission, with relative transparency strongly dependent on plasmonic mode excitation and saturating at pump fluences of about 200 nJ cm-2. The maximal relative transparency, reaching 45 % at 350 nJ cm -2, occurs under resonant excitation of a localized plasmon mode at the strong electrostatic modulation of 2DEG concentration. Transient dynamics reveal ultrafast relaxation times of 15-20 ps, while the effects can be observed at elevated temperatures of up to 150 K. A nonlinear model of plasmonic crystal, based on finite-difference time-domain electrodynamic simulations coupled with viscous hydrodynamic electron transport model, elucidates key nonlinear mechanisms, including near-field effects under metallic gratings, electron heating, plasmon resonance broadening, and redshift. These results demonstrate that even conventional semiconductors such as AlGaN/GaN can achieve nonlinear THz responses comparable to or exceeding those of graphene, showing strong potential for ultrafast THz modulation and nonlinear photonics applications.

Title: Two-component nonlinear wave solutions of the sixth-order generalised Boussinesq-type equations
Authors: G. T. Adamashvili
Abstract: Two different versions of cubic sixth-order generalised Boussinesq-type wave equations are considered in this study. A generalised perturbation reduction method is used to solve these equations, which allows the reduction of considered equations to coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations. Two-component nonlinear wave solutions are obtained. The profiles and parameters of these solutions for both nonlinear equations are presented and compared. These solutions coincide with the vector 0 \pi pulse of self-induced transparency, which was previously studied in several known nonlinear wave equations.

Title: Smart Reaction Templating: A Graph-Based Method for Automated Molecular Dynamics Input Generation
Authors: Julian Konrad, Robert MeiÃner
Abstract: Accurately modeling chemical reactions in molecular dynamics simulations requires detailed pre- and post-reaction templates, often created through labor-intensive manual workflows. This work introduces a Python-based algorithm that automates the generation of reaction templates for the LAMMPS REACTION package, leveraging graph-theoretical principles and sub-graph isomorphism techniques. By representing molecular systems as mathematical graphs, the method enables automated identification of conserved molecular domains, reaction sites, and atom mappings, significantly reducing manual effort. The algorithm was validated on three case studies: poly-addition, poly-condensation, and chain polymerization, demonstrating its ability to map conserved regions, identify reaction-initiating atoms, and resolve challenges such as symmetric reactants and indistinguishable atoms. Additionally, the generated templates were optimized for computational efficiency by retaining only essential reactive domains, ensuring scalability and consistency in high-throughput workflows for computational chemistry, materials science, and machine learning applications. Future work will focus on extending the method to mixed organic-inorganic systems, incorporating adaptive scoring mechanisms, and integrating quantum mechanical calculations to enhance its applicability.

Title: Generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs from two interacting quantum emitters
Authors: AdriÃ¡n Juan-Delgado, Geza Giedke, Javier Aizpurua, Ruben Esteban
Abstract: Entangled photon pairs are key elements in quantum communication and quantum cryptography. State-of-the-art sources of entangled photons are mainly based on parametric-down conversion from nonlinear crystals, which is probabilistic in nature, and on cascade emission from biexciton quantum dots, which finds difficulties in generating entangled photons in the visible regime. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that polarization-entangled photon pairs can be emitted from two interacting quantum emitters with two-level-system behaviour and perpendicular transition dipole moments. These emitters can represent a large variety of systems (e.g., organic molecules, quantum dots and diamond-color centers) offering a large technological versatility, for example in the spectral regime of the emission. We show that a highly entangled photon pair can be post-selected from this system by including optical filters. Additionally, we verify that the photon entanglement is not significantly affected by small changes in the detection directions and in the orientation between the dipole moments.

Title: Comparative study of divacancies in 3C-, 4H- and 6H-SiC
Authors: Danial Shafizade, Joel Davidsson, Takeshi Ohshima, Nguyen Tien Son, Ivan G. Ivanov
Abstract: The divacancy comprising two neighboring vacant sites in the SiC lattice is a promising defect for applications in quantum technology. So far, most work is concerned with the divacancy in 4H-SiC, whereas the divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC have received much less attention. Here, we outline arguments showing that the neutral charge state of the divacancies in the latter two polytypes is intrinsically stable, in contrast to that in 4H-SiC where the photoluminescence quenches in most materials for certain excitation energies (below approximately 1.3 eV). Divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC are anticipated to remain stable even with resonant excitation. We provide new ab initio calculation results for the charge transfer levels of divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC. Using the temperature dependence of the divacancy emission in 3C-SiC, we estimate the energy position of the (+|0) charge transfer level of the divacancy within the bandgap of this polytype and compare with theoretical results.

Title: Universal analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles
Authors: Nikolai G. Khlebtsov, Sergey V. Zarkov
Abstract: From a structural point of view, plasmonic nanoparticles are always at least two-layer structures with a dielectric layer of stabilizing, targeting, fluorescent, Raman, or other functional molecules, often embedded in a matrix such as porous silica. To optimize the optical properties of such bioconjugates, one needs efficient analytical models based on simple physical ideas and with reasonable accuracy comparable to rigorous numerical methods requiring significant computer resources. Here, we present such type models based on a combination of the modal expansion method (MEM) and the dipole equivalence method (DEM). The MEM+DEM approach makes it possible to use the MEM parameters of the original metal particles and does not require additional numerical calculations to build models for bilayered or multilayered conjugates. Our analytical solutions depend on the particle shape, the shell thickness, and the shell refractive index, regardless of the particle size and the metal's nature. To illustrate the universality of our method, we calculate extinction and scattering spectra of gold and silver nanorods, nanodiscs, triangle nanoprisms, bicones, and bipyramids with a dielectric coating thickness from 0 to 30 nm. For the main plasmonic peaks, we found excellent agreement between our analytical method and numerical simulations performed with COMSOL. Due to the simplicity and reasonable accuracy of the MEM+DEM analytical models, they can help apply machine learning to predict various plasmonic responses such as light absorption, scattering, SERS, and metal-enhanced fluorescence.

Title: Meson dynamics from locally exciting a particle-conserving $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory
Authors: Vaibhav Sharma, Kaden R. A. Hazzard
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is an important avenue to gain insights into both particle physics phenomena and constrained quantum many-body dynamics. There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy collision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on current quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined mesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a particle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple, experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact numerics.

Title: Les Houches lectures on Theoretical Ecology: High-dimensional models and extreme events
Authors: Ada Altieri
Abstract: The study of ecological systems is gaining momentum in modern scientific research, driven by an abundance of empirical data and advancements in bioengineering techniques. However, a full understanding of their dynamical and thermodynamical properties, also in light of the ongoing biodiversity crisis, remains a formidable endeavor. From a theoretical standpoint, modeling the interactions within these complex systems -- such as bacteria in microbial communities, plant-pollinator networks in forests, or starling murmurations -- presents a significant challenge. Given the characteristic high dimensionality of the datasets, alternative elegant approaches employ random matrix formalism and techniques from disordered systems. In these lectures, we will explore two cornerstone models in theoretical ecology: the MacArthur/Resource-Consumer model, and the Generalized Lotka-Volterra model, with a special focus on systems composed of a large number of interacting species. In the second part, we will highlight timely directions, particularly to bridge the gap with empirical observations and detect macroecological patterns.

Title: Bosonizations and dualities in 2+1 dimensions
Authors: Andrea Cappelli, Riccardo Villa
Abstract: We discuss two methods for relating bosonic and fermionic relativistic field theories in 2+1 dimensions, the $Z_2^f$ gauging and the flux attachment. The first is primarily a correspondence between topological theories. It amounts to summing over fermionic spin structures, as is familiar in two-dimensional conformal theories. Its inverse map, fermionization, shows how spin structures and $Z_2^f$ fermion parity emerge from a bosonic theory equipped with a dual $Z_2^{(1)}$ generalized symmetry. The second method,flux attachment, gives spin and statistics to charged particles by coupling them to a Chern-Simons theory, and provides the basis for the Abelian dualities. We illustrate the two bosonizations with explicit results in a solvable semiclassical conformal theory, and show their differences and interplays with particle-vortex dualities. We employ the so-called loop model, which can describe general infrared critical points in 2+1 dimensions in the semiclassical limit. We also combine the two bosonizations to obtain further duality relations. By applying $Z_2^f$ gauging to the Dirac-boson and Majorana-boson flux-attachment dualities, we find new relations between bosonic theories.

Title: Atomistic tight-binding Hartree-Fock calculations of multielectron configurations in P-doped silicon devices: wavefunction reshaping
Authors: Maicol A. Ochoa, Keyi Liu, Piotr RÃ³Å¼aÅski, MichaÅ ZieliÅski, Garnett W. Bryant
Abstract: Donor-based quantum devices in silicon are attractive platforms for universal quantum computing and analog quantum simulations. The nearly-atomic precision in dopant placement promises great control over the quantum properties of these devices. We present atomistic calculations and a detailed analysis of many-electron states in a single phosphorus atom and selected phosphorus dimers in silicon. Our self-consistent method involves atomistic calculations of the electron energies utilizing representative tight-binding Hamiltonians, computations of Coulomb and exchange integrals without any reference to an atomic orbital set, and solutions to the associated Hartree-Fock equations. First, we assess the quality of our tight-binding Hartree-Fock protocol against Configuration-Interaction calculations for two electrons in a single phosphorus atom, finding that our formalism provides an accurate estimation of the electron-electron repulsion energy requiring smaller computational boxes and single-electron wavefunctions. Then, we compute charging and binding energies in phosphorus dimers observing their variation as a function of impurity-impurity separation. Our calculations predict an antiferromagnetic ground state for the two-electron system and a weakly bound three-electron state in the range of separations considered. We rationalize these results in terms of the single-electron energies, charging energies, and the wavefunction reshaping.

Title: First-principles study of optoelectronic and thermoelectronic properties of the ScAgC half-Heusler compound
Authors: Vinod Kumar Solet, Shamim Sk, Sudhir K. Pandey
Abstract: Here, we present a theoretical study in the context of photovoltaic (PV) and thermoelectric (TE) applications of ScAgC. The electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties have been investigated systematically using density functional theory (DFT) and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. DFT calculates a direct band gap of 0.47 eV, whereas the $G_{0}W_{0}$ method estimates a band gap of 1.01 eV. We used parabola fitting to estimate the effective mass values for bands B1 to B4 at $\Gamma$-point, which are -0.087 (-0.075), -0.17 (-0.27), -0.17 (-0.27), and 0.049 (0.058) along the $\Gamma$-$X$ ($\Gamma$-$L$) direction, respectively. Furthermore, the optoelectronic properties are calculated and analyzed over an energy range of 0 to 10 eV. The optical conductivity, refractive index, and dielectric function show strong optical transitions in the visible region. The lowest calculated reflectivity is 0.24 at 4.7 eV, and the highest calculated value of the absorption coefficient is $1.7\times10^{6}$ cm$^{-1}$ at $8.5$ eV. At 300 K, we expect a maximum solar efficiency (SLME) of 33\% at a thickness of $1~\mu$m. The lattice part of the thermal conductivity shows a maximum value of 3.8 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at $1200$ K. At 1200 K, for electron doping of $3.9\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$, the maximum value of $S^{2}\sigma /\tau$ is $145 \times 10^{14}$ $\mu$WK$^{-2}$cm$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, while for hole doping of $1.5\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$, it is $123 \times 10^{14}$ $\mu$WK$^{-2}$cm$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. The highest $ZT$ at $1200$ K is expected to be $0.53$, whereas the optimal efficiency is predicted to be $8.5\%$ for cold and hot temperatures of $300$ K and $1200$ K, respectively. The collected results suggest that the ScAgC compound is a potential candidate for renewable energy sources such as solar cell and TE applications

Title: The ordinary surface universality class of the three-dimensional O($N$) model
Authors: Francesco Parisen Toldin
Abstract: We study the critical behavior at the ordinary surface universality class of the three-dimensional O($N$) model, bounded by a two-dimensional surface. Using high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of an improved lattice model, where the leading bulk scaling correction is suppressed, and finite-size scaling analysis of the fourth cumulant of the surface magnetization, we obtain precise estimates of the scaling dimension of the surface field operator for $N=2,3,4$. We also determine the fixed-point values of two renormalization-group invariant observables, which characterize the finite-size scaling behavior at the ordinary transition.

Title: Out-of-Equilibrium Dynamics in the Two-Component Bose-Hubbard Model
Authors: Florian R. BÃ¤r, Malcolm P. Kennett
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model for two-component bosons using a strong-coupling approach within the closed-time-path formalism and develop an effective theory for the action of this problem. We obtain equations of motion for the superfluid order parameters of both boson species for both the superfluid and Mott-insulating phases and study these in the low-frequency, long-wavelength limit during a quantum quench for various initial conditions. We find that an additional degree of freedom for bosons leads to a richer phase diagram and out-of-equilibrium dynamics than the single-component situation.

Title: Canted antiferromagnetism in a spin-orbit coupled $S_{\text{eff}} = 3/2$ triangular-lattice magnet DyAuGe
Authors: Takashi Kurumaji, Masaki Gen, Shunsuke Kitou, Kazuhiko Ikeuchi, Hajime Sagayama, Hironori Nakao, Tetsuya R. Yokoo, Taka-hisa Arima
Abstract: Exploration of nontrivial magnetic states induced by strong spin-orbit interaction is a central topic of frustrated magnetism. Extensive studies are concentrated on rare-earth-based magnets and 4d/5d transition metal compounds, which are mostly described by an effective spin $S_{\text{eff}} = 1/2$ for the Kramers doublet of the lowest crystal-electric-field levels. Variety of magnetic orderings may be greatly enhanced when magnetic dipolar moments intertwined with multipolar degrees of freedom which are described by higher-rank tensors and often require the magnetic ions with $S_{\text{eff}} > 1/2$. Here, our synchrotron x-ray diffraction near the Dy $L_3$ edge has unveiled a canted antiferromagnetic ground state arising from a quasi-quartet ($S_{\text{eff}} = 3/2$) of 4f electrons in a triangular-lattice (TL) rare-earth intermetallics DyAuGe. Magnetic moment and electric-quadrupole moment are closely interlocked and noncollinear magnetic-dipole alignment is induced by antiferroic electric-quadrupole (AFQ) ordering in the TL layers. The correlation between the AFQ and canted magnetic structures is further confirmed by phase transitions in an in-plane magnetic field. These findings offer insights into the emergence of nontrivial magnetic states in frustrated TL systems described beyond the $S_{\text{eff}} = 1/2$.

Title: Temperature dependence of the Raman spectrum of orthorhombic Bi2Se3

Abstract: Bismuth selenide, a benchmark topological insulator, grows in a trigonal structure at ambient conditions and exhibits a number of enticing properties related to the formation of Dirac surface states. Besides this polytype, a metastable orthorhombic modification with Pnma space group has been produced by electrodeposition and high-pressure high-temperature synthesis displaying upon Sb doping significant thermoelectric properties in the midtemperature range. However, very little experimental information is available on the fundamental properties of this polytype, such as, e.g., the electronic band gap and the lattice dynamics. We report here the temperature dependence of the Raman spectra of orthorhombic Bi2Se3 between 10 K and 300 K, which displays an anharmonic behavior of the optical phonons that can be modelled with a two-phonon decay channel. In order to analyze the data we performed ab initio calculations of the electronic bandstructure, the phonon frequencies at the center of the Brillouin zone, and the phonon dispersion relations along the main symmetry directions, examining the effect of spin-orbit coupling in both phonon and electronic energies. Lastly, we report here cathodoluminescence experiments at 83 K that set a lower limit to the electronic bandgap at 0.835 eV, pointing to an indirect nature, in agreement with our calculations. These results shed light to essential properties of orthorhombic Bi2Se3 for further understanding of the potential of this semiconductor for thermoelectrics and new applications.

Abstract: This study introduces BIRDSHOT, an integrated Bayesian materials discovery framework designed to efficiently explore complex compositional spaces while optimizing multiple material properties. We applied this framework to the CoCrFeNiVAl FCC high entropy alloy (HEA) system, targeting three key performance objectives: ultimate tensile strength/yield strength ratio, hardness, and strain rate sensitivity. The experimental campaign employed an integrated cyber-physical approach that combined vacuum arc melting (VAM) for alloy synthesis with advanced mechanical testing, including tensile and high-strain-rate nanoindentation testing. By incorporating batch Bayesian optimization schemes that allowed the parallel exploration of the alloy space, we completed five iterative design-make-test-learn loops, identifying a non-trivial three-objective Pareto set in a high-dimensional alloy space. Notably, this was achieved by exploring only 0.15% of the feasible design space, representing a significant acceleration in discovery rate relative to traditional methods. This work demonstrates the capability of BIRDSHOT to navigate complex, multi-objective optimization challenges and highlights its potential for broader application in accelerating materials discovery.

Title: Systematic Modulation of Charge and Spin in Graphene Nanoribbons on MgO
Authors: Amelia DomÃ­nguez-Celorrio, Leonard Edens, SofÃ­a Sanz, Manuel Vilas-Varela, Jose Martinez-Castro, Diego PeÃ±a, VÃ©ronique Langlais, Thomas Frederiksen, JosÃ© I. Pascual, David Serrate
Abstract: Graphene nanostructures can be engineered with atomic precision to display customized electronic states with application in spintronics or quantum technologies. In order to take advantage of their full potential, their charge and spin state must be precisely controlled. Graphene systems exchange charge to reach thermodynamic equilibrium with their environment, requiring external gating potentials to tune their ground state. Alternative strategies like intrinsic doping or substrate modifications provided small variations of their equilibrium charge and poor control over their spin. Here, we show systematic manipulation of the electron occupation in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) laying on MgO layers grown on Ag(001). Owing to the extraordinary decoupling properties of MgO, and the electropositive character of the substrate, GNRs are found to host an integer number of electron charges that depend on their length and shape. This results in the alternation between a non-magnetic closed-shell state and an open-shell paramagnetic system for even and odd electron occupations respectively. For the odd case, we found the spectral fingerprint of a narrow Coulomb correlation gap, which is the smoking gun of its spin 1/2 paramagnetic state. Comparisons of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) data with mean-field Hubbard (MFH) simulations confirm the practical discretization of the GNR electronic states and point to charge excess of up to 19 electrons in a single ribbon. We anticipate that GNRs supported by MgO ultra-thin insulating films can open the door to customized devices for quantum sensing and quantum processing applications..

Title: Direct observation of phase change accommodating hydrogen uptake in bimetallic nanoparticles
Authors: LÃ­via P. Matte, Maximilian Jaugstetter, Alisson S. Thill, Tara P. Mishra, Carlos Escudero, Giuseppina Conti, Fernanda Poletto, Slavomir Nemsak, Fabiano Bernardi
Abstract: Hydrogen holds great promise as a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels, but its efficient and affordable storage remains a significant challenge. Bimetallic systems, such as Pd-Ni, present a promising option for storing hydrogen. In this study, using the combination of different cuttingedge X-ray and electron techniques, we observed the transformations of Pd-Ni nanoparticles, which initially consist of a NiO-rich shell surrounding a Pd-rich core but undergo a major transformation when interacting with hydrogen. During the hydrogen exposure, the Pd core breaks into smaller pockets, dramatically increasing its surface area and enhancing the hydrogen storage capacity, especially in nanoparticles with lower Pd content. The findings provide deep understanding of the morphological changes at the atomic level during hydrogen storage and contribute for designing cost-effective hydrogen storage using multi-metallic systems.

Title: Designing single and degenerate flat bands in the kagome lattice with long-range hopping
Authors: Yuta Taguchi, Motoaki Hirayama, Takashi Miyake
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of the kagome lattice model with first, second, and two kinds of third nearest-neighbor hoppings. We reveal that by tuning the third nearest-neighbor hoppings, not only single flat band but also degenerate flat band can be created on the \Gamma - M line. We provide the detailed conditions to realize them. The coexistence of these bands can be almost realized near the fundamental band gap in graphene with triangular defects in a superhoneycomb arrangement. Furthermore, due to these flat bands, several sharp peaks appear in the optical conductivity. Our results strongly indicate that long-range electron hopping has a new possibility for designing electronic structures.

Title: Training a multilayer dynamical spintronic network with standard machine learning tools to perform time series classification
Authors: Erwan Plouet, DÃ©dalo Sanz-HernÃ¡ndez, Aymeric Vecchiola, Julie Grollier, Frank Mizrahi
Abstract: The ability to process time-series at low energy cost is critical for many applications. Recurrent neural network, which can perform such tasks, are computationally expensive when implementing in software on conventional computers. Here we propose to implement a recurrent neural network in hardware using spintronic oscillators as dynamical neurons. Using numerical simulations, we build a multi-layer network and demonstrate that we can use backpropagation through time (BPTT) and standard machine learning tools to train this network. Leveraging the transient dynamics of the spintronic oscillators, we solve the sequential digits classification task with $89.83\pm2.91~\%$ accuracy, as good as the equivalent software network. We devise guidelines on how to choose the time constant of the oscillators as well as hyper-parameters of the network to adapt to different input time scales.

Title: Ephemeral Superconductivity Atop the False Vacuum
Authors: Gal Shavit, Stevan Nadj-Perge, Gil Refael
Abstract: A many body system in the vicinity of a first-order phase transition may get trapped in a local minimum of the free energy landscape. These so-called false-vacuum states may survive for exceedingly long times if the barrier for their decay is high enough. The rich phase diagram obtained in graphene multilayer devices presents a unique opportunity to explore transient superconductivity on top of a correlated false vacuum. Specifically, we consider superconductors which are terminated by an apparent first-order phase transition to a correlated phase with different symmetry. We propose that quenching across this transition leads to a non-equilibrium ephemeral superconductor, readily detectable using straightforward transport measurements. Besides enabling a simple detection scheme, the transient superconductor also generically enhances the false vacuum lifetime, potentially by orders of magnitude. In several scenarios, the complimentary effect takes place as well: superconductivity is temporarily emboldened in the false vacuum, albeit ultimately decaying. We demonstrate the applicability of these claims for two different instances of superconductivity terminated by a first order transition in rhombohedral graphene. The obtained decay timescales position this class of materials as a promising playground to unambiguously realize and measure non-equilibrium superconductivity.

Title: Magneto transport and first principle study of strong topological insulator gray Arsenic
Authors: N. K. Karn, Kapil Kumar, Geet Awana, Kunal Yadav, S. Patnaik, V.P.S. Awana
Abstract: This article reports the synthesis of a single crystalline gray Arsenic (As) via the Bismuth flux method. The X-ray Diffraction (XRD) pattern revealed the single phase of the grown crystal, which crystallized in the rhombohedral structure with the space group R3m. The sharp XRD peaks observed on mechanically exfoliated thin flakes of the same ensured high crystallinity of the same with growth direction along the c-axis. The resistivity measurements illustrated its metallic nature throughout, right from 300K down to 2K. The measured residual resistivity ratio of the sample is 180, which endorses the high metallic nature of the as-synthesized As single crystal. The transverse magnetic field-dependent resistivity (RH) measurements elucidated huge magneto-resistance (MR) at 2K and 14Tesla transverse magnetic fields. Also seen are the SDH oscillations, indicating the presence of topological surface states. The non-trivial band topology and edge states in As are confirmed by first principle calculations.

Title: Moment method and continued fraction expansion in Floquet Operator Krylov Space
Authors: Hsiu-Chung Yeh, Aditi Mitra
Abstract: Recursion methods such as Krylov techniques map complex dynamics to an effective non-interacting problem in one dimension. For example, the operator Krylov space for Floquet dynamics can be mapped to the dynamics of an edge operator of the one-dimensional Floquet inhomogeneous transverse field Ising model (ITFIM), where the latter, after a Jordan-Wigner transformation, is a Floquet model of non-interacting Majorana fermions, and the couplings correspond to Krylov angles. We present an application of this showing that a moment method exists where given an autocorrelation function, one can construct the corresponding Krylov angles, and from that the corresponding Floquet-ITFIM. Consequently, when no solutions for the Krylov angles are obtained, it indicates that the autocorrelation is not generated by unitary dynamics. We highlight this by studying certain special cases: stable $m$-periodic dynamics derived using the method of continued fractions, exponentially decaying and power-law decaying stroboscopic dynamics. Remarkably, our examples of stable $m$-periodic dynamics correspond to $m$-period edge modes for the Floquet-ITFIM where deep in the chain, the couplings correspond to a critical phase. Our results pave the way to engineer Floquet systems with desired properties of edge modes and also provide examples of persistent edge modes in gapless Floquet systems.

Title: Physical meaning of principal component analysis for classical lattice systems with translational invariance
Authors: Su-Chan Park
Abstract: We explore the physical implications of applying principal component analysis (PCA) to translationally invariant classical systems defined on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice. Using Rayleigh-SchrÃ¶dinger perturbation theory, we demonstrate that the principal components are related to the reciprocal lattice vectors of the hypercubic lattice, and the corresponding eigenvalues are connected to the discrete Fourier transform of the sampled configurations. From a different perspective, we show that the PCA in question can be viewed as a numerical method for computing the ensemble average of the squared moduli of the Fourier transform of physical quantities. Our results also provide a way to determine approximately the principal components of a classical system with translational invariance without the need for matrix diagonalization.

Title: Diverging entanglement of critical magnons in easy-axis antiferromagnets
Authors: Jongjun M. Lee, Hyun-Woo Lee, Myung-Joong Hwang
Abstract: We study the instability of antiferromagnets with easy-axis anisotropy under a magnetic field, uncovering single or even multiple phase transitions at the boundary between non-collinear and collinear spin orderings. Near the phase boundary, the entanglement between the sublattice magnons diverges due to the interplay among antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, anisotropy, and magnetic field. Furthermore, our study reveals that this magnetic criticality extends to a superradiant phase transition within cavity magnonics systems. The magnon-photon interaction results in diverging cavity photon numbers and squeezing in the ground state at the transition points between spin orderings. This investigation not only elucidates the criticality of multi-component squeezed magnons in antiferromagnets, but also proposes cavity photon measurements as a viable method for detecting magnetic phase transitions.

Title: Giant Rabi frequencies between qubit and excited hole states in silicon quantum dots
Authors: E. Fanucchi, G. Forghieri, A. Secchi, P. Bordone, F. Troiani
Abstract: Holes in Si quantum dots are being investigated for the implementation of electrically addressable spin qubits. In this perspective, the attention has been focused on the electric-field induced transitions between the eigenstates belonging to the ground doublet. Here we theoretically extend the analysis to the first excited doublet. We show that - in a prototypical quantum dot structure - transitions involving the lowest excited states display Rabi frequencies that are several orders of magnitude larger than those occurring in the ground doublet. A clear relation with the symmetries of the eigenstates emerges, as well as a wide tunability of the Rabi frequencies by means of the applied bias. A preliminary discussion on the possible implications of the present results for multilevel manipulation schemes and for multi-hole qubit encodings is provided.

Title: Partition function approach to non-Gaussian likelihoods: information theory and state variables for Bayesian inference
Authors: Rebecca Maria Kuntz, Heinrich von Campe, Tobias RÃ¶spel, Maximilian Philipp Herzog, BjÃ¶rn Malte SchÃ¤fer
Abstract: The significance of statistical physics concepts such as entropy extends far beyond classical thermodynamics. We interpret the similarity between partitions in statistical mechanics and partitions in Bayesian inference as an articulation of a result by Jaynes (1957), who clarified that thermodynamics is in essence a theory of information. In this, every sampling process has a mechanical analogue. Consequently, the divide between ensembles of samplers in parameter space and sampling from a mechanical system in thermodynamic equilibrium would be artificial. Based on this realisation, we construct a continuous modelling of a Bayes update akin to a transition between thermodynamic ensembles. This leads to an information theoretic interpretation of Jazinsky's equality, relating the expenditure of work to the influence of data via the likelihood. We propose one way to transfer the vocabulary and the formalism of thermodynamics (energy, work, heat) and statistical mechanics (partition functions) to statistical inference, starting from Bayes' law. Different kinds of inference processes are discussed and relative entropies are shown to follow from suitably constructed partitions as an analytical formulation of sampling processes. Lastly, we propose an effective dimension as a measure of system complexity. A numerical example from cosmology is put forward to illustrate these results.

Title: Rough or crumpled: Strong coupling phases of a generalized Kardar-Parisi-Zhang surface
Authors: Debayan Jana, Abhik Basu
Abstract: We study a generalized Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation [D. Jana et al, Phys. Rev. E 109, L032104 (2024)], that sets the paradigm for universality in roughening of growing nonequilibrium surfaces without any conservation laws, but with competing local and nonlocal nonlinear effects. This equation in two dimensions is shown to describe a strong coupling rough or a crumpled surface, in addition to a weak coupling phase. The conformation fluctuations of such a rough surface are given by nonuniversal scaling exponents, with orientational long-ranged order and positional short-ranged order, whereas the crumpled phase has positional and orientational short range order.

Title: Spin-split flat bands at the band edge and two-dimensional hole gases towards quantum Hall effect in altermagnetic CoF$_2$
Authors: Bo-Wen Yu, Bang-Gui Liu
Abstract: Altermagnetic phase is recently found as a new magnetic phase in addition to the conventional collinear spin orders, and great efforts have been made to explore novel effects and potential applications in such materials. Here, we show that there are robust altermagnetic spin-split flat bands near the valence band edge in rutile CoF$_2$ through first-principles investigation. It is uncovered that the magnetic moments can remain in the z axis because of the magnetocrystalline energy due to the spin-orbits coupling and the spin orientation can be made more stable by magnetic field applied in the xy plane. We describe the spin-dependent band structure (including the flat bands) near the Fermi level by a spin-resolved effective low-energy model, and reveal that they can host spin-dependent two-dimensional hole gases. Importantly, we find spin-dependent quantum Hall effects in the two-dimensional hole gases by applying the magnetic field in the xy plane, and then explore the dependence of Hall conductivity and Hall resistance on the Fermi level and the magnetic field (both magnitude and direction) and related longitudinal carrier transport properties.

Title: Band Curvature Effects on Quantum Transport of Spin-1 Chiral Fermion Systems
Authors: Risako Kikuchi, Ai Yamakage
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the quantum transport properties of three-dimensional spin-1 chiral fermion systems with a curved trivial band. In the multiband system with two distinct characters--a linear Dirac band and a quadratic trivial band--the hybridization induced by impurity effects leads to pronounced energy and temperature dependences in the electrical conductivity. We show that the conductivity is suppressed by the trivial band in the low-energy regime near the threefold degenerate point and enhanced in the band-crossing point of the Dirac and trivial bands. These results are derived using the self-consistent Born approximation within the framework of linear response theory.

Title: Structural and Magnetic Properties of Co-rich bct CoMn Films
Authors: S. F. Peterson, Y. U. Idzerda
Abstract: Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm 0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Pauling curve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average total moment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the historical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations reveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on MgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments than those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001), BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average atomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increased structural stability and therefore thicker film growths.

Title: Reduced Wannier Representation for Topological Bands
Authors: Trey Cole, David Vanderbilt
Abstract: Bands with non-trivial topological indices have a topological obstruction preventing them from being represented by exponentially localized Wannier states. Here, we propose a procedure to construct exponentially localized Wannier functions that span a subspace of topologically obstructed bands through the use of the projection method. These Wannier functions form what we refer to as a "reduced Wannier representation," indicating that the Wannier functions necessarily do not span the full topological manifold. By constructing supercells, we obtain reduced Wannier functions that break the primitive translational symmetry while capturing a substantial portion of the topologically obstructed manifold. This approach effectively decomposes the topological manifold into two subspaces: an itinerant subspace inheriting the topology and a localized trivial subspace represented by reduced Wannier functions. We consider the Haldane and Kane-Mele tight-binding models as the platforms for our investigation.

Title: Deconfined classical criticality in the anisotropic quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XY model on the square lattice
Authors: Christopher Mudry, Ãmer M. Aksoy, Claudio Chamon, Akira Furusaki
Abstract: The anisotropic quantum spin-1/2 XY model on a linear chain was solved by Lieb, Schultz, and Mattis in 1961 and shown to display a continuous quantum phase transition at the O(2) symmetric point separating two gapped phases with competing Ising long-range order. For the square lattice, the following is known. The two competing Ising ordered phases extend to finite temperatures, up to a boundary where a transition to the paramagnetic phase occurs, and meet at the O(2) symmetric critical line along the temperature axis that ends at a tricritical point at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature where the two competing phases meet the paramagnetic phase. We show that the first-order zero-temperature (quantum) phase transition that separates the competing phases as a function of the anisotropy parameter is smoothed by thermal fluctuations into deconfined classical criticality.

Title: Launching Focused and Spatially Confined Phonon-Polaritons in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Bogdan Borodin, Sergey Lepeshov, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Petr Stepanov
Abstract: Phonon-polaritons offer significant opportunities for low-loss, subdiffractional light guiding at the nanoscale. Despite extensive efforts to enhance control in polaritonic media, focused and spatially confined phonon-polariton waves have only been realized in in-plane-anisotropic crystals (e.g., MoO$_3$) and remain elusive in in-plane-isotropic materials (e.g., hexagonal boron nitride, hBN). In this study, we introduce a novel approach to launching phonon-polaritons by leveraging hBN subwavelength cavities at the Au/SiO$_2$ interface, enabling efficient coupling of cavities to the far-field component of mid-infrared light. Utilizing standard lithographic techniques, we fabricated subwavelength cavities of various shapes and sizes, demonstrating strong field enhancement, resonant mode localization, and generation of propagating phonon-polaritons with well-defined spatial structure. The cavity geometry governs wavefront curvature, spatial confinement, and polariton focusing, providing control over their propagation and achieving record-high in-plane confinement up to $\lambda/70$. Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy reveals the real-space optical contrast of these cavity-launched modes, allowing for detailed characterization. We believe that our cavity-based approach to phonon-polariton focusing in isotropic media will pave the way for advanced nanophotonic applications.

Title: Two-Peak Heat Capacity Accounts for $R\ln(2)$ Entropy and Ground State Access in the Dipole-Octupole Pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$
Authors: E. M. Smith, A. Fitterman, R. SchÃ¤fer, B. Placke, A. Woods, S. Lee, S. H.-Y. Huang, J. Beare, S. Sharma, D. Chatterjee, C. Balz, M. B. Stone, A. I. Kolesnikov, A. R. Wildes, E. Kermarrec, G. M. Luke, O. Benton, R. Moessner, R. Movshovich, A. D. Bianchi, B. D. Gaulin
Abstract: Magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high-quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K are reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However a second, sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, which signifies the entrance to its ground state, as even the most abrupt low-temperature extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K gives a full accounting of $R\ln(2)$ in entropy, associated with the well isolated pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$, at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$, for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical spin liquid to a quantum spin liquid (QSL). The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI).

Title: The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions
Authors: Subir Sachdev
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a 'large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed 'small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. Critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the FL-SDW quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the 'foot' of strange metal transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the 'fan' of strange metal behavior of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and the pseudogap metal is described by thermal fluctuations above a 'fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*) or a 'holon metal', with the descriptions related by a duality on a background spin liquid. The quantum critical fan is described using a field theory for an underlying FL-FL* quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder. This field theory can be mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully models linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations in the quantum critical fan. The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.

Title: Polarons and Exciton-Polarons in Two-Dimensional Polar Materials
Authors: V. Shahnazaryan, A. Kudlis, I. V. Tokatly
Abstract: We propose a macroscopic theory of optical phonons, Fr{Ã¶}hlich polarons, and exciton-polarons in two-dimensional (2D) polar crystalline monolayers. Our theory extends the classical macroscopic formulation of the electron-phonon problem in three-dimensional (3D) polar crystals to the new generation of 2D materials. Similarly to the 3D case, in our approach, the effective electron-phonon Hamiltonian is parametrized solely in terms of macroscopic experimentally accessible quantities -- 2D polarizabilities of the monolayer at low and high frequencies. We derive the dispersion of long wave length longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, which can be viewed as a 2D form of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation, and study the formation of 2D Fr{Ã¶}hlich polarons by adopting the intermediate coupling approximation. Finally, we apply this approach to excitons in polar 2D crystals and derive an effective potential of the electron-hole interaction dressed by LO phonons. Due to a specific dispersion of LO phonons, polarons and exciton-polarons in 2D materials exhibit unique features not found in their 3D counterparts. As an illustration, the polaron and exciton-polaron binding energies are computed for a representative set of 2D polar crystals, demonstrating the interplay between dimensionality, polarizability of materials, and electron-phonon coupling.

Title: Higher-order contagion processes in 1.99 dimensions
Authors: Sandro Meloni, Andrea Gabrielli, Pablo Villegas
Abstract: Higher-order interactions have recently emerged as a promising framework for describing new dynamical phenomena in heterogeneous contagion processes. However, a fundamental open question is how to understand their contribution in the eyes of the physics of critical phenomena. Based on mesoscopic field-theoretic Langevin descriptions, we show that: (i) pairwise mechanisms as facilitation or thresholding are formally equivalent to higher-order ones, (ii) pairwise interactions at coarse-grained scales govern the higher-order contact process and, (iii) classical Imry-Ma arguments hold for networks with low spectral dimension. In short, we demonstrate that classical field theories, grounded on model symmetries and/or network dimensionality, still capture the nature of the phase transition, also predicting finite-size effects in real and synthetic networks.

Title: Algebraic Exact Solution for Driven Landau Levels in Two-dimensional Electron Gases
Authors: Li-kun Shi
Abstract: Controlling quantum systems with time-dependent fields opens avenues for engineering novel states of matter and exploring non-equilibrium phenomena. Landau levels in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs), with their discrete energy spectrum and characteristic cyclotron dynamics, provide an important platform for realizing and studying such driven quantum systems. While exact solutions for driven Landau levels exist, they have been limited to specific gauges or representations. In this work, we present an algebraic, gauge- and representation-independent exact solution for driven Landau levels in 2DEGs subject to arbitrary time-dependent electromagnetic fields. Our approach, based on a time-dependent unitary transformation via the displacement operator, provides clear physical insights into the driven quantum dynamics. We apply this method to derive the exact Floquet states and quasienergies for periodically driven Landau levels, and we extend our analysis to the resonant driving regime, where the Floquet picture breaks down and the electron wavefunction exhibits unbounded spatial spreading. Furthermore, we calculate the instantaneous energy absorption rate, revealing distinct absorption behaviors between coherent states and Fock or thermal states, stemming from quantum interference effects.

Title: Agnostic calculation of atomic free energies with the descriptor density of states
Authors: Thomas D Swinburne, Clovis Lapointe, Mihai-Cosmin Marinica
Abstract: We present a new method to evaluate vibrational free energies of atomic systems without a priori specification of an interatomic potential. Our model-agnostic approach leverages descriptors, high-dimensional feature vectors of atomic structure. The entropy of a high-dimensional density, the descriptor density of states, is accurately estimated with conditional score matching. Casting interatomic potentials into a form extensive in descriptor features, we show free energies emerge as the Legendre-Fenchel conjugate of the descriptor entropy, avoiding all high-dimensional integration. The score matching campaign requires less resources than fixed-model sampling and is highly parallel, reducing wall time to a few minutes, with tensor compression schemes allowing lightweight storage. Our model-agnostic estimator returns differentiable free energy predictions over a broad range of potential parameters in microseconds of CPU effort, allowing rapid forward and back propagation of potential variations through finite temperature simulations, long desired for uncertainty quantification and inverse design. We test predictions against thermodynamic integration calculations over a broad range of models for BCC, FCC and A15 phases of W, Mo and Fe at high homologous temperatures. Predictions pass the stringent accuracy threshold of 1-2 meV/atom (1/40-1/20 kcal/mol) for phase prediction with propagated score uncertainties robustly bounding errors. We also demonstrate targeted fine-tuning, reducing the alpha-gamma transition temperature in a non-magnetic machine learning model of Fe from 2030 K to 1063 K through back-propagation, with no additional sampling. Applications to liquids and fine-tuning foundational models are discussed along with the many problems in computational science which estimate high-dimensional integrals.

Title: Spin waves in the bilayer van der Waals magnet CrSBr
Authors: Rob den Teuling, Ritesh Das, Artem V. Bondarenko, Elena V. Tartakovskaya, Gerrit E. W. Bauer, Yaroslav M. Blanter
Abstract: We derive analytical expressions for the spin wave frequencies and precession amplitudes in monolayer and antiferromagnetically coupled bilayer CrSBr under in-plane external magnetic fields. The analysis covers the antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and canted phases, demonstrating that the spin wave frequencies in all phases are tunable by the applied magnetic field. We discuss the roles of intra- and interlayer exchange interactions, triaxial anisotropy, and intralayer dynamic dipolar fields in controlling the magnetization dynamics.

Title: Comment on 2501.17230 and 2502.00103 "Phonon-mediated electron attraction in SrTiO3 via the generalized Frohlich and deformation potential mechanisms" and "Theory of ab initio downfolding with arbitrary range electron-phonon coupling"
Authors: Jonathan Ruhman
Abstract: This comment critically examines the claims made in arXiv papers arXiv:2501.17230 and arXiv:2502.00103, which argue that a multiplicity of polar optical phonons can generate a long-range attractive interaction via a generalized Frohlich coupling. I identify a fundamental flaw in their derivation, showing that their result relies on an unphysical assumption--specifically, neglecting the intermode Coulomb interactions between different polar optical phonons. By restoring these missing interactions I show the screened Coulomb interaction is always repulsive in the static limit.

Title: Modelling the non-linear viscoelastic behaviour of brain tissue in torsion
Authors: G. Small, F. Ballatore, C. Giverso, V. Balbi
Abstract: Brain tissue accommodates non-linear deformations and exhibits time-dependent mechanical behaviour. The latter is one of the most pronounced features of brain tissue, manifesting itself primarily through viscoelastic effects such as stress relaxation. To investigate its viscoelastic behaviour, we performed ramp-and-hold relaxation tests in torsion on freshly slaughtered cylindrical ovine brain samples ($25\,\,\text{mm}$ diameter and $\sim 10\,\,\text{mm}$ height). The tests were conducted using a commercial rheometer at varying twist rates of $\{40,240,400\}\,\,\text{rad}\,\,\text{m}^{-1}\,\,\text{s}^{-1}$, with the twist remaining fixed at $\sim 88\,\,\text{rad}\,\,\text{m}^{-1}$, which generated two independent datasets for torque and normal force. The complete set of viscoelastic material parameters was estimated via a simultaneous fit to the analytical expressions for the torque and normal force predicted by the modified quasi-linear viscoelastic model. The model's predictions were further validated through finite element simulations in FEniCS. Our results show that the modified quasi-linear viscoelastic model - recently reappraised and largely unexploited - accurately fits the experimental data. Moreover, the estimated material parameters are in line with those obtained in previous studies on brain samples under torsion. When coupled with bespoke finite element models, these material parameters could enhance our understanding of the forces and deformations involved in traumatic brain injury and contribute to the design of improved headgear for sports such as boxing and motorsports. On the other hand, our novel testing protocol offers new insights into the mechanical behaviour of soft tissues other than the brain.

Title: Universal whirling magnetic orders in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type quasicrystal approximants
Authors: Farid Labib, Kazuhiro Nawa, Yusuke Nambu, Hiroyuki Takakura, Yoichi Ikeda, Kazuhiko Deguchi, Masato Matsuura, Asuka Ishikawa, Ryoichi Kajimoto, Kazuhiko Ikeuchi, Taku J. Sato, Ryuji Tamura
Abstract: Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.

Title: Doping-Driven Modulation of Spin-Orbit Coupling, Spin Textures, and Rashba-Edelstein Response in Chiral Tellurium: A First-Principles Study
Authors: Sonam Phuntsho
Abstract: Chiral semiconductors such as elemental tellurium (Te) exhibit unconventional spin textures and large charge-to-spin conversion efficiencies, yet the influence of doping on these properties remains underexplored. Here, we address this gap by investigating how substituting Te with lighter (S, Se) or heavier (Sb) elements systematically modifies the spin-orbit-driven phenomena in chiral Te, including the band structure, spin Berry curvature, and Rashba-Edelstein response. The objective is to determine whether doping strategies can be leveraged to optimize collinear spin textures, enhance spin accumulation, and possibly extend spin lifetimes-all crucial aspects for magnet-free spintronics. Using density functional theory calculations implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO, combined with tight-binding interpolation in PAOFLOW, we map out the doping-dependent electronic states and quantify their associated spin transport coefficients. Our findings reveal that lighter dopants shift the Fermi level to regions of pronounced spin splitting, thereby increasing the magnitude of spin current conversion, whereas heavier dopants can introduce or remove near-degenerate bands that strongly affect spin-orbit coupling. In both scenarios, the fundamental chirality of Te remains robust, preserving the radial or "collinear" spin-momentum locking. These results not only confirm that doping is a potent and feasible route for tuning spin-orbit phenomena but also offer practical guidelines for experimental efforts aiming to engineer chiral semiconductors for spin devices. By correlating dopant identity with specific spin-texture enhancements, this study paves the way for rationally designing next-generation spintronic components free from external magnetic fields.

Title: Fixing the AdS$_3$ metric from the pure state entanglement entropies of CFT$_2$
Authors: Peng Wang, Houwen Wu, Haitang Yang
Abstract: In this paper, based on RT formula, by identifying the pure state UV and IR entanglement entropies of a perturbed CFT$_2$ with geodesic lengths in the bulk, we demonstrate that the dual geometry is uniquely determined to be asymptotically AdS$_3$. The pure AdS$_3$ geometry is recovered by taking the massless limit of the system. Our derivations hold in both static and covariant scenarios.

Title: Interfacial flows in sessile evaporating droplets of mineral water
Authors: Massimiliano Rossi, Alvaro Marin, Christian Kaehler
Abstract: Liquid flow in sessile evaporating droplets of ultrapure water typically results from two main contributions: a capillary flow pushing the liquid towards the contact line from the bulk and a thermal Marangoni flow pulling the drop free surface towards the summit. Current analytical and numerical models are in good qualitative agreement with experimental observations however they overestimate the interfacial velocity values by 2-3 orders of magnitude. This discrepancy is generally ascribed to contamination of the water samples with non-soluble surfactants, however an experimental confirmation of this assumption has not yet been provided. In this work, we show that a small "ionic contamination" can cause a significant effect in the flow pattern inside the droplet. To provide the proof, we compare the flow in evaporating droplets of ultrapure water with commercially available bottled water of different mineralization levels. Mineral waters are bottled at natural springs, are micro-biologically pure, and contain only traces of minerals (as well as traces of other possible contaminants), therefore one would expect a slower interfacial flow as the amount of "contaminants" increase. Surprisingly, our results show that the magnitude of the interfacial flow is practically the same for mineral waters with low content of minerals as that of ultrapure water. However, for waters with larger content of minerals, the interfacial flow tends to slow down due to the presence of ionic concentration gradients. Our results show a much more complex scenario than it has been typically suspected, and therefore a deeper and more comprehensive analysis of the huge differences between numerical models and experiments is necessary.

Title: Social Network Heterogeneity Promotes Depolarization of Multidimensional Correlated Opinions
Authors: Jaume Ojer, Michele Starnini, Romualdo Pastor-Satorras
Abstract: We propose the multidimensional social compass model, based on two competing key ingredients: DeGroot learning, driven by the social influence exerted across multiple topics, and the preference of individuals to maintain their initial opinions. The interplay between these two mechanisms triggers a phase transition from polarization to consensus, determined by a threshold value of social influence. We analytically study the nature of the depolarization transition and its threshold depending on the number of topics discussed, the possible correlations between initial opinions, the topology of the underlying social networks, and the correlations between the initial opinion distribution and the network's structure. Theoretical predictions are validated by running numerical simulations on both synthetic and real social networks. We rely on several simplifying assumptions to explore different scenarios, such as a mean-field approximation for high dimension, or orthogonal initial orientations. We uncover an upper critical dimension (D_c = 5 topics) for uncorrelated initial opinions, distinguishing between discontinuous and continuous phase transitions. For the simplest D = 2 case and correlated initial opinions, we found that the depolarization threshold can vanish if the underlying connectivity is heterogeneous, as predicted by perturbation theory. Such an effect is due to the presence of hubs, which promote consensus in the population. We test this hypothesis by designing a rewiring algorithm that increases the structural heterogeneity of the underlying network, showing that the depolarization threshold decreases. Finally, we demonstrate that if hubs share the same initial opinion, the depolarization dynamics is significantly hindered.

Title: Thermodynamic Computing via Autonomous Quantum Thermal Machines
Authors: Patryk Lipka-Bartosik, MartÃ­ Perarnau-Llobet, Nicolas Brunner
Abstract: We develop a physics-based model for classical computation based on autonomous quantum thermal machines. These machines consist of few interacting quantum bits (qubits) connected to several environments at different temperatures. Heat flows through the machine are here exploited for computing. The process starts by setting the temperatures of the environments according to the logical input. The machine evolves, eventually reaching a non-equilibrium steady state, from which the output of the computation can be determined via the temperature of an auxilliary finite-size reservoir. Such a machine, which we term a ``thermodynamic neuron'', can implement any linearly-separable function, and we discuss explicitly the cases of NOT, 3-MAJORITY and NOR gates. In turn, we show that a network of thermodynamic neurons can perform any desired function. We discuss the close connection between our model and artificial neurons (perceptrons), and argue that our model provides an alternative physics-based analogue implementation of neural networks, and more generally a platform for thermodynamic computing.

Title: Momentum Distribution of a Fermi Gas in the Random Phase Approximation
Authors: Niels Benedikter, Sascha Lill
Abstract: We consider a system of interacting fermions on the three-dimensional torus in a mean-field scaling limit. Our objective is computing the occupation number of the Fourier modes in a trial state obtained through the random phase approximation (in its collective bosonization formulation) for the ground state. We prove that the trial state's momentum distribution has a jump discontinuity, i.e., a well-defined Fermi surface. Moreover the Fermi momentum does not depend on the interaction potential (it is universal). Our result shows that the random phase approximation in the mean-field scaling limit is in principle sufficiently precise to identify a non-trivial Fermi liquid phase.

Title: Generative modeling through internal high-dimensional chaotic activity
Authors: Samantha J. Fournier, Pierfrancesco Urbani
Abstract: Generative modeling aims at producing new datapoints whose statistical properties resemble the ones in a training dataset. In recent years, there has been a burst of machine learning techniques and settings that can achieve this goal with remarkable performances. In most of these settings, one uses the training dataset in conjunction with noise, which is added as a source of statistical variability and is essential for the generative task. Here, we explore the idea of using internal chaotic dynamics in high-dimensional chaotic systems as a way to generate new datapoints from a training dataset. We show that simple learning rules can achieve this goal within a set of vanilla architectures and characterize the quality of the generated datapoints through standard accuracy measures.

Title: 2D hydrodynamic simulation of TeraFETs beyond the gradual-channel approximation for transient, large-signal or ultrahigh-frequency simulations
Authors: Florian Ludwig, Hartmut G. Roskos, Raul Borsche
Abstract: In the past decade, detection of THz radiation by plasma-wave-assisted frequency mixing in antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs) -- implemented in various semiconductor material systems (Si CMOS, GaN/AlGaN, GaAs/AlGaAs, graphene, etc.) -- has matured and led to a practically applied detector technology. This has been supported by the development of powerful device simulation tools which take into account relevant collective carrier dynamics and mixing processes in various approximations. These tools mostly model carrier transport in 1D and they are usually geared towards continuous-wave illumination of the device and small-signal response. Depending on their implementation, it may not be possible readily to simulate large-signal and pulsed operation. Another approximation which may lead to unsatisfactory results is the 1D restriction to calculate only the longitudinal electric field components. Especially at the edges of the gate electrode, solving of the 2D Poisson equation promises better results. This contribution introduces a stable way to solve the 2D Poisson equation self-consistently with the hydrodynamic transport equations including the numerically challenging convection term. We employ a well-balanced approximate Harten-Lax-van-Leer-Contact Riemann solver. The approach is well suited for a future treatment of transient and large-signal cases. The 2D treatment also generically extends the model beyond the gradual-channel approximation and allows to calculate the FET's response at high THz frequencies where the gate-to-channel potential acquires a non-local character. Model calculations are performed for the exemplary case of a 65-nm Si CMOS TeraFET in the isothermal approximation.

Title: Stochastic Resetting Mitigates Latent Gradient Bias of SGD from Label Noise
Authors: Youngkyoung Bae, Yeongwoo Song, Hawoong Jeong
Abstract: Giving up and starting over may seem wasteful in many situations such as searching for a target or training deep neural networks (DNNs). Our study, though, demonstrates that resetting from a checkpoint can significantly improve generalization performance when training DNNs with noisy labels. In the presence of noisy labels, DNNs initially learn the general patterns of the data but then gradually memorize the corrupted data, leading to overfitting. By deconstructing the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we identify the behavior of a latent gradient bias induced by noisy labels, which harms generalization. To mitigate this negative effect, we apply the stochastic resetting method to SGD, inspired by recent developments in the field of statistical physics achieving efficient target searches. We first theoretically identify the conditions where resetting becomes beneficial, and then we empirically validate our theory, confirming the significant improvements achieved by resetting. We further demonstrate that our method is both easy to implement and compatible with other methods for handling noisy labels. Additionally, this work offers insights into the learning dynamics of DNNs from an interpretability perspective, expanding the potential to analyze training methods through the lens of statistical physics.

Title: Exploring the dynamical interplay between mass-energy equivalence, interactions and entanglement in an optical lattice clock
Authors: Anjun Chu, Victor J. MartÃ­nez-Lahuerta, Maya Miklos, Kyungtae Kim, Peter Zoller, Klemens Hammerer, Jun Ye, Ana Maria Rey
Abstract: We propose protocols that probe manifestations of the mass-energy equivalence in an optical lattice clock (OLC) interrogated with spin coherent and entangled quantum states. To tune and uniquely distinguish the mass-energy equivalence effects (gravitational redshift and second order Doppler shift) in such a setting, we devise a dressing protocol using an additional nuclear spin state. We then analyze the dynamical interplay between photon-mediated interactions and gravitational redshift and show that such interplay can lead to entanglement generation and frequency synchronization dynamics. In the regime where all atomic spins synchronize, we show the synchronization time depends on the initial entanglement of the state and can be used as a proxy of its metrological gain compared to a classical state. Our work opens new possibilities for exploring the effects of general relativity on quantum coherence and entanglement in OLC experiments.

Title: Multiscale Embedding for Quantum Computing
Authors: Leah P. Weisburn, Minsik Cho, Moritz Bensberg, Oinam Romesh Meitei, Markus Reiher, Troy Van Voorhis
Abstract: We present a novel multi-scale embedding scheme that links conventional QM/MM embedding and bootstrap embedding (BE) to allow simulations of large chemical systems on limited quantum devices. We also propose a mixed-basis BE scheme that facilitates BE calculations on extended systems using classical computers with limited memory resources. Benchmark data suggest the combination of these two strategies as a robust path in attaining the correlation energies of large realistic systems, combining the proven accuracy of BE with chemical and biological systems of interest in a lower computational cost method. Due to the flexible tunability of the resource requirements and systematic fragment construction, future developments in the realization of quantum computers naturally offer improved accuracy for multi-scale BE calculations.

Title: Large inverse Faraday effect for Rydberg states of free atoms and isolated donors in semiconductors
Authors: Patrick J. Wong, Ivan M. Khaymovich, Gabriel Aeppli, Alexander V. Balatsky
Abstract: We report on the induction of magnetization in Rydberg systems by means of the inverse Faraday effect, and propose the appearance of the effect in two such systems, Rydberg atoms proper and shallow dopants in semiconductors. Rydberg atoms are characterized by a large orbital radius. This large radius gives such excited states a large angular moment, which when driven with circularly polarized light, translates to a large effective magnetic field ${B}_{\text{eff}}$. We calculate this effect to generate effective magnetic fields of $O(1\,\mu\text{T})\times\left( \frac{\omega}{1\,\text{THz}} \right)^{-1} \left( \frac{I}{10\,\text{W cm}^{-2}} \right) n^4$ in the Rydberg states of atoms such as Rb and Cs for off-resonant photon beams with frequency omega and intensity ${I}$ expressed in units of the denominators and $n$ the principal quantum number. Additionally, terahertz spectroscopy of phosphorus doped silicon reveals a large cross-section for excitation of shallow dopants to Rydberg-like states, which even for small $n$ have the potential to be driven similarly with circularly polarized light to produce an even larger magnetization. Our theoretical calculations estimate ${B}_{\text{eff}}$ as $O(10^2\,\text{T})$ for Si:P with a beam intensity of $10^8\,\text{W cm}^{-2}$.

Title: Krylov space approach to Singular Value Decomposition in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Pratik Nandy, Tanay Pathak, Zhuo-Yu Xian, Johanna Erdmenger
Abstract: We propose a tridiagonalization approach for non-Hermitian random matrices and Hamiltonians using singular value decomposition (SVD). This technique leverages the real and non-negative nature of singular values, bypassing the complex eigenvalues typically found in non-Hermitian systems. We analyze the tridiagonal elements, namely the Lanczos coefficients and the associated Krylov (spread) complexity, appropriately defined through the SVD, across several examples, including Ginibre ensembles and the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. We demonstrate that in chaotic cases, the complexity exhibits a distinct peak due to the repulsion between singular values, a feature absent in integrable cases. Using our approach, we analytically compute the Krylov complexity for two-dimensional non-Hermitian random matrices within a subset of non-Hermitian symmetry classes including time-reversal, time-reversal$^{\dagger}$, chiral, and sublattice symmetry.

Title: Machine-learning Accelerated Descriptor Design for Catalyst Discovery: A CO$_2$ to Methanol Conversion Case Study
Authors: Prajwal Pisal, Ondrej Krejci, Patrick Rinke
Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of novel thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can easily be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. Finally, we propose new promising candidate materials such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.

Title: Shape and Performance of Fastest Paths over Networks with Interacting Selfish Agents
Authors: Marco Cogoni, Giovanni Busonera, Enrico Gobbetti
Abstract: We study the evolution of the fastest paths (FP) in transportation networks under increasing congestion. Moving from the common edge-based to a path-based analysis, we examine the directed FPs connecting random origin-destination pairs as traffic grows. We describe their shape through effective length, detour (maximum distance of FP from a straight line), inness (signed area between FP and straight line), and their performance through a novel metric measuring how fast and how far an agent travels toward its destination. The entire network is characterized by analyzing the distribution of the performance metric (and its Gini coefficient) across uniformly sampled paths. The study focuses on the traffic loading phenomenon that takes place during the morning peak hour for eight major cities: Networks start with empty edges that are progressively populated by the FPs of single vehicles. As vehicle density grows, the interactions among selfish agents becomes stronger at edge level, and travel speed linearly decreases, thus optimal paths dynamically change with traffic. We fully characterize the transition to congestion and discuss the common aspects among the cities (and some peculiarities), in particular we were able to pinpoint a critical traffic level (or a sequence) for which path shape, rejection ratio, and inequality of the performance degradation, show a concurrent qualitative change. For all cities we observe large peaks for both detour and inness (and their variance) in the proximity of the critical traffic level. Inness shows that paths are slightly attracted by city centers with light traffic, but switch to a strong repulsion immediately beyond the transition. Finally, our path performance metric highlighted a strongly asymmetric behavior when the city neighborhoods act as origins or destinations.

Title: Investigating the Bouncing Barrier with Collision Simulations of Compressed Dust Aggregates
Authors: Haruto Oshiro, Misako Tatsuuma, Satoshi Okuzumi, Hidekazu Tanaka
Abstract: The collision outcomes of dust aggregates in protoplanetary disks dictate how planetesimals form. Experimental and numerical studies have suggested that bouncing collisions occurring at low impact velocities may limit aggregate growth in the disks, but the conditions under which bouncing occurs have yet to be fully understood. In this study, we perform a suite of collision simulations of moderately compact dust aggregates with various impact velocities, aggregate radii, and filling factors ranging between 0.4 and 0.5. Unlike previous simulations, we generate compact aggregates by compressing more porous ones, mimicking the natural processes through which compact aggregates form. We find that the compressed aggregates bounce above a threshold mass, which decreases with impact velocity. The threshold mass scales with impact velocity as the $-4/3$ power, consistent with the findings of previous experiments. We also find that the threshold aggregate mass for bouncing depends strongly on filling factor, likely reflecting the strong filling-factor dependence of the compressive strength of compressed aggregates. Our energy analysis reveals that nearly 90\% of the initial impact energy is dissipated during the initial compression phase, and over 70\% of the remaining energy is dissipated during the subsequent stretching phase, regardless of whether the collision results in sticking or bouncing. Our results indicate that dust aggregates with a filling factor of 0.4 cease to grow beyond 100 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ as a result of the bouncing barrier.

Title: Accurate and efficient machine learning interatomic potentials for finite temperature modeling of molecular crystals
Authors: Flaviano Della Pia, Benjamin X. Shi, Venkat Kapil, Andrea Zen, Dario AlfÃ¨, Angelos Michaelides
Abstract: As with many parts of the natural sciences, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing the modeling of molecular crystals. However, challenges remain for the accurate and efficient calculation of sublimation enthalpies - a key thermodynamic quantity measuring the stability of a molecular crystal. Specifically, two key stumbling blocks are: (i) the need for thousands of ab initio quality reference structures to generate training data; and (ii) the sometimes unreliable nature of density functional theory, the main technique for generating such data. Exploiting recent developments in foundational models for chemistry and materials science alongside accurate quantum diffusion Monte Carlo benchmarks, offers a promising path forward. Herein, we demonstrate the generation of MLIPs capable of describing molecular crystals at finite temperature and pressure with sub-chemical accuracy, using as few as $\sim 200$ data structures; an order of magnitude improvement over the current state-of-the-art. We apply this framework to compute the sublimation enthalpies of the X23 dataset, accounting for anharmonicity and nuclear quantum effects, achieving sub-chemical accuracy with respect to experiment. Importantly, we show that our framework can be generalized to crystals of pharmaceutical relevance, including paracetamol and aspirin. Nuclear quantum effects are also accurately captured as shown for the case of squaric acid. By enabling accurate modeling at ambient conditions, this work paves the way for deeper insights into pharmaceutical and biological systems.
