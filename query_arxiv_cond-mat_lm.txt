Title: Motility-dependent selective transport of active matter in trap arrays: Separation methods based on trapping-detrapping and deterministic lateral displacement
Authors: Vyacheslav R. Misko, Franco Nori, Wim De Malsche
Abstract: Selecting active matter based on its motility represents a challenging task, as it requires different approaches than common separation techniques intended for separation based on, e.g., size, shape, density, and flexibility. This motility-based selection is important for, e.g., selecting biological species, such as bacteria or highly motile sperm cells for medically assisted reproduction. Common separation techniques are not applicable for separating species based on motility as such species can have indistinguishable physical properties, i.e., size, shape, density, and differ only by their ability to execute self-propelled motion as, e.g., motile, and immotile sperm cells. Therefore, selecting active species based on motility requires completely different approaches. Some of these have been developed including sperm cell selection techniques, e.g., swim-up techniques, passive selection methods based on the ability of highly motile sperm cells to swim across streamlines, as well as more sophisticated techniques. Here we theoretically demonstrate via numerical simulations various efficient methods of selection and separation based on the motility of active species using arrays of traps. Two approaches are proposed: one allowed the selective escape of motile species from traps, and the other one relying on a deterministic lateral displacement (DLD)-type method. As a model system, we consider self-propelled Janus particles whose motility can be tuned. The resulted separation methods are applicable for separation of biological motile species, such as bacteria or sperm cells, as well as for Janus micro- and nanoparticles.

Title: Long-range spin transport in asymmetric quadruple quantum dots configurations
Authors: David Fernández-Fernández, Johannes C. Bayer, Rolf J. Haug, Gloria Platero
Abstract: We theoretically investigate long-range coherent charge transport in linear quadruple quantum dot (QQD) arrays under reduced symmetry configurations. Employing a master equation approach, we identify precise resonant conditions that enable minimal occupation of intermediate dots, thereby facilitating long-range transfer between distant sites. Our results highlight the critical role of parameter asymmetry and coherent tunneling mechanisms in achieving efficient quantum state transfer.

Title: Density of states correlations in Lévy Rosenzweig-Porter model via supersymmetry approach
Authors: Elizaveta Safonova, Aleksey Lunkin, Mikhail Feigel' man
Abstract: We studied global density-of-states correlation function $R(\omega)$ for Lévy-Rosenzveig-Porter random matrix ensemble~\cite{BirTar_Levy-RP} in the non-ergodic extended phase. Using extension of Efetov's supersymmetry approach ~\cite{MirFyod_non_Gauss} we calculated $R(\omega)$ exactly in all relevant ranges of $\omega$. At relatively low $\omega \leq \Gamma$\, (with $\Gamma \gg \Delta$ being effective mini-band width) we found GUE-type oscillations with period of level spacing $\Delta$, decaying exponentially at the Thouless energy scale $E_{Th} = \sqrt{\Delta \Gamma/2\pi}$. At high energies $\omega \gg E_{Th}$ our results coincide with those obtained in Ref.~\cite{lunkin2024localdensitystatescorrelations} via cavity equation approach. Inverse of the effective mini-band width $1/\Gamma$ is shown to be given by the average of the local decay times over Lévy distribution.

Title: Multicomponent Linear Transport in the Absence of Local Equilibrium
Authors: Yu-Jen Chiu, Eric M. Weiner, Ahmad K. Omar
Abstract: The linear laws of transport phenomena are central in our description of irreversible processes in systems across the physical sciences. Linear irreversible thermodynamics allows for the identification of the underlying forces driving transport and the structure of the relevant transport coefficients for systems that are locally in equilibrium. Increasingly, linear relations are found to describe transport in systems in which a local equilibrium hypothesis is unlikely to hold. Here, we derive a mechanical theory of multicomponent transport without appealing to equilibrium notions. Our theory for the Onsager transport tensor highlights the general breakdown of the familiar Onsager reciprocal relations and Einstein relations when a local equilibrium is absent. The procedure outlined is applied to a variety of systems, including passive systems, mixtures with nonreciprocal interactions, electrolytes under an electric field, and active systems, and can be straightforwardly used to understand other transport processes. The framework further provides a basis to extend numerical approaches for computing the transport coefficients of nonequilibrium systems, as is demonstrated for a system with nonreciprocal interactions.

Title: Fully Generalized Spin Models with Strain Effects of Kitaev Spin Liquid Candidate Materials
Authors: Pureum Noh, Hyunggeun Lee, Myung Joon Han, Eun-Gook Moon
Abstract: The $KJ\Gamma\Gamma'$ spin model-originally derived for an ideal $P\bar{3}1m$ symmetric geometry-has long served as a central framework for understanding candidate Kitaev materials. In realistic crystals, however, this ideal geometry is seldom realized, either at low temperatures or under external perturbations, limiting the model's quantitative applicability. Here we introduce a fully generalized spin model, denoted $\epsilon$-$KJ\Gamma\Gamma'$, that explicitly incorporates arbitrary lattice deformations $\epsilon$. All spin-exchange interactions and their strain-dependent coefficients are obtained from density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and a microscopic derivation of coupling constants for materials based on $d^5$ transition-metal ions. For $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ under a strain of $3\%$, new emergent exchange channels acquire magnitudes comparable to their unstrained counterparts. Building on these parameters, we investigate strain-driven quantum phase transitions between competing magnetic states-including the zigzag order and the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL)-and identify a strain-induced topological transition within the KQSL states that offers a practical diagnostic of Kitaev physics. Furthermore, our symmetry analysis of the $\epsilon$-$KJ\Gamma\Gamma'$ model is applicable to both $d^{5}$ ions, such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and $d^{7}$ systems, including cobalt-based compounds.

Title: Dynamical detection of extended nonergodic states in many-body quantum systems
Authors: David A. Zarate-Herrada, Isaías Vallejo-Fabila, Lea F. Santos, E. Jonathan Torres-Herrera
Abstract: Fractal dimensions are tools for probing the structure of quantum states and identifying whether they are localized or delocalized in a given basis. These quantities are commonly extracted through finite-size scaling, which limits the analysis to relatively small system sizes. In this work, we demonstrate that the correlation fractal dimension $D_2$ can be directly obtained from the long-time dynamics of interacting many-body quantum systems. Specifically, we show that it coincides with the exponent of the power-law decay of the time-averaged survival probability, defined as the fidelity between an initial state and its time-evolved counterpart. This dynamical approach avoids the need for scaling procedures and enables access to larger systems than those typically reachable via exact diagonalization. We test the method on various random matrix ensembles, including full random matrices, the Rosenzweig-Porter model, and power-law banded random matrices, and extend the analysis to interacting many-body systems described by the one-dimensional Aubry-André model and the disordered spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain. In the case of full random matrices, we also derive an analytical expression for the entire evolution of the time-averaged survival probability.

Title: Band Structure Engineering of Coupled-Resonator Phononic Polyacetylene and Polyaminoborane
Authors: B. Manjarrez-Montañez, R. A. Méndez-Sánchez, Y. Betancur-Ocampo, A. Martínez-Argüello
Abstract: A methodology for constructing a quasi-one-dimensional coupled-resonator phononic metamaterial is presented. This is achieved through the design of artificial phononic analogs of two molecular structures: trans-polyacetylene and trans-polyaminoborane. The band structure of trans-polyacetylene is analyzed in relation to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, while that of trans-polyaminoborane is examined using the $\kappa$-deformed Dirac equation, both within a tight-binding framework. Additionally, the obtained finite realization of the artificial trans-polyacetylene exhibits topologically protected states.

Title: Molecular Dynamics Prediction of the Effect of Neutron Irradiation on the Ductile-to-Brittle Transition in Fe-Ni-Cr Alloys
Authors: A. Ustrzycka, H. Mousavi, F. J. Dominguez-Gutierrez, S. Stupkiewicz
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive investigation into the fracture behavior of irradiated Fe-Ni-Cr alloys, focusing on the radiation-induced ductile-to-brittle transition (DBT). Unlike the commonly studied temperature-driven DBT, this transition is driven by radiation-induced defects, which impede dislocation motion and reduce the material's capacity for plastic deformation, ultimately leading to brittle failure. Utilizing Molecular Dynamics simulations, this work examines the interaction between radiation-induced defects, such as dislocation loops and voids, and their influence on crack propagation and energy dissipation mechanisms. The results reveal distinct roles played by these defects: voids facilitate crack growth by reducing local cohesive energy, while dislocation loops act as barriers that impede crack advancement and redirect crack paths, significantly altering crack morphology. Building on the classical approach of separating fracture energy into brittle cleavage and plastic components, this study adapts this decomposition to irradiated materials. This approach appraises the distinct roles of surface energy and plastic work across varying radiation damage levels, providing critical insights into how irradiation-induced defects govern fracture dynamics.

Title: Interaction between shallow NV$^-$ and spin active azafullerenes on hydrogenated and fluorinated (001) diamond surfaces
Authors: Bastien Anézo, Denis Arčon, Chris Ewels
Abstract: The interaction between surface-lying nitrogen-substituted fullerenes (radical azafullerene, C$_{59}$N$^\bullet$) with sub-surface negative nitrogen-vacancy complexes (NV$^-$) in diamond is investigated using first principles calculations. We consider (2$\times$1) reconstructed (001) oriented diamond surfaces with both H- and F-surface termination. The charge stability of NV$^-$, when in close proximity to both the nearby surface and the spin active azafullerene is discussed, in the context of diamond band bending arising from surface-induced changes in electron affinity (EA). In the case of the hydrogenated surface, the system spin is quenched, yielding a negatively charged azafullerene (C$_{59}$N$^-$) and neutrally charged NV$^0$ as the most stable electronic configuration. In contrast, fluorinating the surface favours the negatively charged NV$^-$, and conserves the C$_{59}$N$^\bullet$, neutrality and stabilizes uncompensated free spins. This opposing behaviour is attributed to surface charge doping emerging from different band bending effects associated with the surface EA. This study is consistent with experimentally observed photoluminescence quenching, and shows that surface passivation by fluorination could efficiently tackle the problem of charge transfer between adsorbed molecules and shallow NV centers.

Title: Strained 2D TMD lateral heterojunctions via grayscale thermal-Scanning Probe Lithography

Abstract: Nanoscale tailoring of the optoelectronic response of 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides semiconductor layers (TMDs) has been achieved thanks to a novel strain engineering approach based on the grayscale thermal-Scanning Probe Lithography (t-SPL). This method allows the maskless nanofabrication of locally strained 2D MoS2-Au lateral heterojunction nanoarrays that are characterized by asymmetric electrical behavior. 2D MoS2 layers are conformally transferred onto grayscale t-SPL templates characterized by periodic nanoarrays of deterministic faceted nanoridges. This peculiar morphology induces asymmetric and uniaxial strain accumulation in the 2D TMD material allowing to tailor their electrical work-function at the nanoscale level, as demonstrated by Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM). The modulation of the electronic response has been exploited to develop periodic nanoarrays of lateral heterojunctions endowed with asymmetric electrical response by simple maskless deposition of Au nanocontacts onto the strained 2D TMD layers. The locally strained Au-MoS2 layers show asymmetric lateral heterojunctions with engineered carrier extraction functionalities, thus representing a promising platform in view of tunable ultrathin nanoelectronic, nanophotonic and sensing applications.

Title: Electrical Detection of Single-Domain Néel Vector Reorientation across the Spin-Flop Transition in Cr2O3 Crystals
Authors: Wei-Cheng Liao, Haoyu Liu, Weilun Tan, Josiah Keagy, Jia-mou Chen, Jing Shi
Abstract: Electrical transport measurements in heterostructures of antiferromagnetic Cr2O3 bulk crystals and a thin Pt layer exhibit sharp responses as the Néel vector of the Cr2O3 undergoes the spin-flop transition. This abrupt change can arise from several distinct mechanisms including magnetostriction, proximity-induced anomalous Hall, spin Hall anomalous Hall, and spin Hall planar Hall effects. While large Pt devices sensing multiple up/down domains can produce indistinguishable Hall signal jumps due to different initial Néel vector orientations, smaller Pt devices that sense single domains isolate the proximity-induced Hall signals. This allows direct electrical detection of Néel vector reorientation across the spin-flop transition in single domain regions. Furthermore, the single-domain state can be prepared by magnetic field cooling or magnetoelectric cooling. We demonstrate a method to control and characterize almost the three-dimensional orientation of single-domain Néel vectors by exploiting Hall measurements and cooling techniques, crucial for future antiferromagnetic spintronic applications.

Title: Relaxation pathways and emergence of domains in square artificial spin ice
Authors: Matteo Menniti, Naëmi Leo, Pedro Villalba-González, Matteo Pancaldi, and Paolo Vavassori
Abstract: Multi-domain states of square artificial spin ice show a range of different morphologies ranging from simple stripe-like domains to more organically shaped coral domains. To model the relevant dynamics leading to the emergence of such diverse domain structures, simplified descriptions of the switching behavior of individual nanomagnets are necessary. In this work, we employ kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the demagnetization of square artificial spin ice toward its ground state, and compare how the choice of transition barriers affect the emergence of mesoscale domains. We find that the commonly used mean-field barrier model (informed by equilibrium energetics only) results in propagation of ground-state string avalanches. In contrast, taking into account chiral barrier splitting enabled by state-dependent local torques supports the emergence of complex-shaped coral domains and their successful relaxation towards the ground state in later relaxation stages. Our results highlight that intrinsic contributions to switching barriers, in addition to the effect of extrinsic defects often attributed to nanofabrication irregularities, can subtly shift favored transition pathways and result in different emergent mesoscale features. Future kinetic Monte Carlo models that describe the evolution of artificial spin systems should thus account for these effects.

Title: Exploring Domain Wall Pinning in Ferroelectrics via Automated High Throughput AFM
Authors: Kamyar Barakati, Yu Liu, Hiroshi Funakubo, Sergei V. Kalinin
Abstract: Domain-wall dynamics in ferroelectric materials are strongly position-dependent since each polar interface is locked into a unique local microstructure. This necessitates spatially resolved studies of the wall-pinning using scanning-probe microscopy techniques. The pinning centers and preexisting domain walls are usually sparse within image plane, precluding the use of dense hyperspectral imaging modes and requiring time-consuming human experimentation. Here, a large area epitaxial PbTiO$_3$ film on cubic KTaO$_3$ were investigated to quantify the electric field driven dynamics of the polar-strain domain structures using ML-controlled automated Piezoresponse Force Microscopy. Analysis of 1500 switching events reveals that domain wall displacement depends not only on field parameters but also on the local ferroelectric-ferroelastic configuration. For example, twin boundaries in polydomains regions like a$_1^-$/$c^+$ $\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stay pinned up to a certain level of bias magnitude and change only marginally as the bias increases from 20V to 30V, whereas single variant boundaries like a$_2^+$/$c^+$ $\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stack are already activated at 20V. These statistics on the possible ferroelectric and ferroelastic wall orientations, together with the automated, high-throughput AFM workflow, can be distilled into a predictive map that links domain configurations to pulse parameters. This microstructure-specific rule set forms the foundation for designing ferroelectric memories.

Title: Cross-Modal Characterization of Thin Film MoS$_2$ Using Generative Models
Authors: Isaiah A. Moses, Chen Chen, Joan M. Redwing, Wesley F. Reinhart
Abstract: The growth and characterization of materials using empirical optimization typically requires a significant amount of expert time, experience, and resources. Several complementary characterization methods are routinely performed to determine the quality and properties of a grown sample. Machine learning (ML) can support the conventional approaches by using historical data to guide and provide speed and efficiency to the growth and characterization of materials. Specifically, ML can provide quantitative information from characterization data that is typically obtained from a different modality. In this study, we have investigated the feasibility of projecting the quantitative metric from microscopy measurements, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), using data obtained from spectroscopy measurements, like Raman spectroscopy. Generative models were also trained to generate the full and specific features of the Raman and photoluminescence spectra from each other and the AFM images of the thin film MoS$_2$. The results are promising and have provided a foundational guide for the use of ML for the cross-modal characterization of materials for their accelerated, efficient, and cost-effective discovery.

Title: Line and Planar Defects with Zero Formation Free Energy: Applications of the Phase Rule toward Ripening-Immune Microstructures
Authors: Ju Li, Yuri Mishin
Abstract: Extended one- and two-dimensional defects in crystalline materials are usually metastable. The thermodynamic ground state of the material is presumed to be defect-free. Here, we investigate the conditions under which extended defects, such as grain boundaries, can exist in a multicomponent alloy when the latter reaches the thermodynamic ground state allowed by the Gibbs phase rule. We treat all extended defects as low-dimensional phases on the same footing as the conventional bulk phases. Thermodynamic analysis shows that, in the ground state, the formation free energies of all extended defects must be zero, and the system must follow a generalized phase rule. The latter predicts that only a finite number of symmetry-related defect types can coexist in the material in the ground state. Guided by the phase rule, we discuss finite-size polycrystalline and/or polyphase microstructures that are fully immune to coarsening and their possible transformations.

Title: Symmetry-Breaking Magneto-Optical Effects in Altermagnets
Authors: Jiuyu Sun, Yongping Du, Erjun Kan
Abstract: The recently discovered altermagnets (AMs), hosting momentum-dependent spin splitting and vanishing net magnetization, have attracted intensive attention for their promising application in novel spintronics. However, limited by facility and material constraints, experimentally distinguishing them from conventional antiferromagnets (AFMs) remains a challenge, which hinders the high-throughput screening for AM candidates. Here, we predict strain-mediated magneto-optical responses in AMs, which can serve as a universal and experimentally accessible strategy for efficient identification of AMs. Symmetry analysis reveals that uniaxial strain can selectively breaks rotation or mirror symmetries in AMs while preserving $PT$ symmetry in AFMs, thereby activating distinct linear magneto-optical responses (e.g., optical absorption and Kerr rotation) unique to AMs. First-principles calculations across prototypical systems -- including semiconducting V$_2$Se$_2$O monolayer and metallic CrSb bulk -- show that the strain-induced optical signatures are significant enough for conventional optical measurements. Our work establishes a rapid, non-invasive characterization methodology for altermagnetism across material platforms, accelerating its exploration for spin-based technologies.

Title: Instantons and topological order in two-leg electron ladders: A universality class
Authors: S.-R. Eric Yang, Hyun Cheol Lee, Hoang-Anh Le, In-Hwan Lee
Abstract: Our numerical study of the disordered Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hopping shows that a two-leg electron ladder has a finite topological entanglement entropy in the regime where the density of states exhibits an exponentially decaying gap. The value of the topological entanglement entropy suggests that two-leg ladders belong to the same universality class as graphene zigzag nanoribbons, despite several structural differences. A Shankar-Witten-type bosonization Lagrangian with disorder captures several features of the numerically obtained results for disordered two-leg ladders. Additionally, we propose a Lagrangian in which the fusion of two semions residing on different chains generates a fermion (instanton). We apply this Lagrangian within the framework of the pinned charge-density-wave model and compute the relevant Green's function using the bosonization method. This approach predicts a linear density of states at a critical disorder strength. Below this threshold, a soft gap emerges, which is in qualitative agreement with our numerical results.

Title: Quantum anomalous Hall effects and Hall crystals at fractional filling of helical trilayer graphene
Authors: Sen Niu, Jason Alicea, D. N. Sheng, Yang Peng
Abstract: Helical trilayer graphene realizes a versatile moiré system in which anomalous Hall effects have been recently observed at integer and fractional fillings. Focusing on helical trilayers near the magic angle and under a substrate potential, we demonstrate that an isolated higher Chern band with Chern number $|C_{band}|=2$ emerges, enabling the exploration of many-body states beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm. We use exact diagonalization to predict a rich phase diagram of gapped states unattainable in a single $|C_{band}|=1$ band. At filling $\nu=2/3$, we identify a quantum Hall crystal with integer Hall conductance $|\sigma_{H}|=e^2/h$ coexisting with a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ charge density wave order. At $\nu=1/2$, we find a quantum Hall pseudospin ferromagnet featuring extensive ground state degeneracy, Hall conductance $|\sigma_{H}|=e^2/h$, and $2\times 2$ charge order. Finally, at $\nu=1/3$ we find a translation-symmetric fractional Chern insulator with $|\sigma_{H}|=2e^2/3h$. By incorporating spin and valley degrees of freedom, we identify an optimal filling regime $\nu_{\rm{total}}=3+\nu$, where three flavors are fully filled, leaving the fourth at partial filling $\nu$. Notably, inter-flavor interactions renormalize the bandwidth and stabilize all the gapped phases even in realistic parameter regimes away from the chiral limit.

Title: Zener tunnelling in biased bilayer graphene via analytic continuation of semiclassical theory
Authors: Harley Scammell, Oleg P. Sushkov
Abstract: Employing a semiclassical method based on analytic continuation, we compute the electron-hole pair production rate in biased bilayer graphene subject to an in-plane electric field. This approach, originally due to Zwaan, bypasses the need for exact solutions at turning points, which are generally unavailable beyond linear or quadratic band structures. Applying this technique to biased bilayer graphene reveals non-standard features of the asymptotic wavefunctions, in particular the necessity of retaining decaying components even in classically allowed regions. By providing a fully analytic solution, this work complements and clarifies earlier results based on hybrid analytical-numerical treatments, and importantly establishes the absolute normalisation of the pair production rate -- and hence of the tunnelling current.

Title: The understanding of the penetration and clusterization of 1-alkanol in bilayer membrane: An open outlook based on atomistic molecular dynamics simulation
Authors: Anirban Polley
Abstract: 1-alkanols are well known to have anesthetic and penetration properties, though the mode of operation remains enigmatic. We perform extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulation to study the penetration of 1-alkanols of different chain lengths in the dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayer model membrane. Our simulations show that the depth of penetration of 1-alkanol increases with chain length, n, and the deuterium order of the DOPC tail increases with the chain length of the acyl-chain of the 1-alkanol. We find a cut-off value for the length of the acyl-chain of 1-alkanol, n = 12, where 1-alkanol with a chain length greater than the cut-off value takes longer to penetrate the membrane. Our simulation study also demonstrates that the membrane exhibits clusters of 1-alkanols with acyl chains longer than the cut-off value, whereas 1-alkanols with acyl-chain shorter than the cut-off value are distributed homogeneously in the membrane and penetrate the membrane in a shorter time than longer-acyl-chain 1-alkanols. These findings add to our understanding of the anomalies in anesthetic molecule partitioning in the cell membrane and may have implications for general anesthesia.

Title: Photostriction-tunable Polarization and Structural Dynamics in Interlayer Sliding Ferroelectrics
Authors: Kun Yang, Jianxin Yu, Jia Zhang, Sheng Meng, Jin Zhang
Abstract: Two-dimensional ferroelectrics with robust polarization offer promising opportunities for non-volatile memory, field-effect transistors, and optoelectronic devices. However, the impact of lattice deformation on polarization and photoinduced structural response remains poorly understood. Here, we employ first-principles calculations to demonstrate photodoping-induced lattice expansion in rhombohedrally stacked bilayer MoS2, revealing a strong coupling between photodoping carrier and lattice structure. We identify a pronounced photostrictive response in sliding ferroelectrics, wherein electron-hole excitation leads to substantial in-plane expansion, increased interlayer spacing, and enhanced ferroelectric polarization. This strain-induced modulation drives significant bandgap renormalization. The photostriction-tunable polarization and structural dynamics arise from the strong electromechanical coupling inherent to the non-centrosymmetric rhombohedral stacking. The findings provide critical insights into the nonthermal lattice expansion governing sliding ferroelectrics at atomic-scale timescales, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for next-generation electronic and memory technologies by leveraging lattice-tunable polarization switching.

Title: Evidence for energy-dependent scattering dominating thermoelectricity in heavy fermion systems
Authors: Daiki Goto, Kentaro Kuga, Kiyohisa Tanaka, Tsunehiro Takeuchi, Masaharu Matsunami
Abstract: In the field of thermoelectric materials and devices, improving energy conversion efficiency remains a long-standing challenge. As a promising approach to address this issue, tuning the electron-scattering mechanisms beyond the ordinary constant relaxation time approximation (CRTA) has been proposed. However, direct experimental evidence for an energy-dependent scattering reflected in the Seebeck coefficient is still lacking. Here we demonstrate using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy that the relaxation time of heavy fermion quasiparticles is highly dependent on the energy near the Fermi level. The observed energy dependence of the relaxation time is due to the coherent Kondo scattering, describing the sign of the Seebeck coefficient reasonably well, which cannot be deduced from CRTA. Our findings provide not only deeper insight into the understanding of thermoelectricity in correlated materials, but also new perspectives on possible orbital-selective engineering of thermoelectric materials.

Title: Bose-Einstein Condensation, Fluctuations and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
Authors: A. Crisanti, A. Sarracino, M. Zannetti
Abstract: The realisation of Bose-Einstein condensation under grand-canonical conditions has provided the experimental evidence for the simultaneous occurrence of macroscopic fluctuations and phase coherence of the condensate. The observation of these two features, against a consolidated tradition which wants the fluctuations to be pathological (grand-canonical catastrophe) and incompatible with spontaneous symmetry braking, calls for a comprehensive rethinking of the approach to the problem. In this paper we consider the uniform ideal gas in a box and we present an alternative conceptual framework. We show that the usually-employed Bogoliubov quasi-average construction fails to reproduce the broken-symmetry state. The observed features are accounted for by a different pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking, characterised by condensation of fluctuations and long-range correlations of the order parameter.

Title: Probing quasiparticle excitations in a doped Mott insulator via Friedel oscillations
Authors: Anurag Banerjee, Emile Pangburn, Catherine Pépin, Cristina Bena
Abstract: In this work, we investigate impurity-induced Friedel oscillations in the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model, focusing on the role of holon and doublon excitations. We show that weak impurities, due to the non-fermionic nature of the underlying quasiparticles, induce Friedel oscillations whose behavior is consistent with an effective non-interacting theory for these quasiparticles, and whose wavevector reflects the violation of Luttinger's theorem. At larger impurity strength, the system transitions to a phase-separated state composed of coexisting Mott-insulating (half-filled) and hole-rich regions. Within the composite operator framework, this phase separation arises from a competition between the kinetic energy of holons and the tendency to form tightly bound holon-doublon pairs. Our results offer new insights into the nature of charge carriers and the emergent electronic phases in the doped Mott regime.

Title: NbTiN Nanowire Resonators for Spin-Photon Coupling on Solid Neon
Authors: Y. Tian, I. Grytsenko, A. Jennings, J. Wang, H. Ikegami, X. Zhou, S. Tamate, H. Terai, H. Kutsuma, D. Jin, M. Benito, E. Kawakami
Abstract: Electrons floating on a solid neon exhibit long charge coherence times, making them attractive for hybrid quantum systems. When combined with high-quality, high-impedance superconducting resonators and a local magnetic field gradient, this platform enables strong charge-photon and spin-charge coupling -- key ingredients for scalable spin qubit architectures. In this work, we fabricated NbTiN superconducting nanowire resonators and measured internal quality factors around $10^5$. We successfully deposited several hundred-nanometer-thick layers of solid neon, followed by gradual electron loading. The presence of neon and electrons was confirmed via resonance frequency shifts without degradation of the resonator's quality factor. These results demonstrate that NbTiN superconducting nanowire resonators are compatible with electrons-on-neon systems and suitable for future qubit experiments. We further performed a theoretical analysis of optimized micro-magnet configurations, showing that spin qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.99% for single-qubit and 99.9% for two-qubit operations are achievable using natural neon at the charge sweet spot.

Title: Universal Phase Transitions of Matter Induced in Optically Driven Cavities
Authors: Tsan Huang, Zhiyuan Sun
Abstract: Optical cavities have been widely applied to manipulate the properties of solid state materials inside it. We propose that in systems embedded within optical cavities driven by incident pump light, the pump induces generic phase transitions into new non-equilibrium steady states. This effect arises from the ponderomotive potential, the effective static potential exerted by the pump on the low energy degrees of freedom, which exhibits a universal step-like structure that pushes the matter degrees of freedom in the direction that red-shifts the cavity photon modes. For a two dimensional electron liquid in a driven cavity, this step-like potential pushes the electron density to jump to a smaller value so that a hybrid cavity photon mode is red shifted to slightly below the pump frequency. Similarly, for a disordered superconductor in such a driven cavity, this potential acts on the superconducting order parameter and causes a first order phase transition to a new steady state with a smaller gap. By realistic electromagnetic modeling of the cavity, we construct the non-equilibrium phase diagrams for experimentally relevant devices.

Title: Revisiting the Topological Nature of TaIrTe4, SrSi2, and Cu2XY3: An ab-initio Investigation
Authors: Prakash Pandey, Sudhir K. Pandey
Abstract: Several topological electronic materials have been theoretically predicted, leading to a comprehensive catalog systematically characterized by their band crossings. Researchers have attempted to experimentally verify the topological nature of some materials from the present catalogs, but not all efforts have yielded positive results. Here, we introduce a possible reason for the discrepancies between theoretical and experimental results. In this direction, firstly we have revisited the nature of the well-known topological materials TaIrTe$_4$ and SrSi$_2$ using \textit{state-of-the-art ab-initio} calculations, and found additional Weyl points in both materials that were missing in previously reported studies. Then we have verified the recently predicted topological states of the \textit{Imm2}-phase of Cu$_2$XY$_3$ (X=Si, Ge, Sn \& Y=S, Se, Te). Contrary to previously reported results, we did not find any Weyl points or nodal arcs in Cu$_2$SnTe$_3$. Notably, our theoretical results reveal that Cu$_2$SiTe$_3$, Cu$_2$GeTe$_3$ and Cu$_2$GeSe$_3$ each host four small nodal rings, eight Weyl points, and eight nodal arcs, respectively, which differ from previous studies. Considering Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ as an example, we have also investigated the robustness of the topological phase against local strain. Our study provides insights into the inconsistencies between theoretical predictions and experimental results, and demonstrates how the topological phase is sensitive to changes in lattice parameters, atomic positions, and exchange-correlation functionals.

Title: Fe contribution to the magnetic anisotropy of $L{1_0}$-ordered FePt thin films studied by angle-dependent x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
Authors: Goro Shibata, Keisuke Ikeda, Takeshi Seki, Shoya Sakamoto, Yosuke Nonaka, Zhendong Chi, Yuxuan Wan, Masahiro Suzuki, Tsuneharu Koide, Hiroki Wadati, Koki Takanashi, Atsushi Fujimori
Abstract: Among magnetic thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), $L1_0$-ordered FePt has attracted significant attention because of its exceptionally strong PMA. However, the microscopic origin of its strong PMA has not been elucidated experimentally. We have investigated the contribution of the Fe $3d$ electrons to its magnetic anisotropy energy by angle-dependent x-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Fe $L_{2,3}$ edge. By this technique, one can deduce the magnetic dipole moment $m_\text{T}$, which represents the anisotropic spatial distribution of spin-polarized electrons, and the orbital moment anisotropy (OMA) of Fe $3d$ electrons. Detected finite $m_\text{T}$ indicates that the spin-polarized Fe $3d$ electrons are distributed preferentially in the out-of-plane direction of the films. This $m_\text{T}$ of Fe overwhelms the positive contribution of OMA to PMA, and reduces the PMA of $L1_0$-ordered FePt thin films, consistent with a previous first-principles calculation. The present result implies that a large positive contribution of the non-magnetic element Pt rather than Fe governs the PMA of $L1_0$-ordered FePt thin films.

Title: Quantum Point Contact with Local Two-body Loss
Authors: Kensuke Kakimoto, Shun Uchino
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in ultracold atomic gas experiments, we investigate a two-terminal mesoscopic system in which two-body loss occurs locally at the center of a one-dimensional chain. By means of the self-consistent Born approximation in the Keldysh formalism, we uncover mesoscopic current formulas that are experimentally relevant and applicable to the weak dissipation regime. Although these formulas are analogous to those for systems with one-body loss, it turns out that the channel transmittance and loss probability depend on the nonequilibrium occupation at the lossy site. We demonstrate that this occupation dependence leads to a weaker suppression of currents in the presence of two-body loss compared to one-body loss, in agreement with a recent experimental observation.

Title: Thinning algorithms for the Monte Carlo simulation of kinetic Ising models
Authors: V. I. Tokar, H. Dreyssé
Abstract: The thinning method for numerical generation of the nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) arrival times has been adapted to accelerate Monte Carlo simulations of the kinetic Ising models (KIMs) with the Glauber spin-flip dynamics. The performance of the suggested algorithms has been illustrated by simulation of the decay of metastable states in stationary KIMs and of hysteresis in KIMs in a periodic external field. The thinning has been implemented by means of piecewise constant majorizing functions which exceed or are equal to NHPP rate. It has been shown that in favorable cases the use of thinning makes possible the simulations of hysteresis at frequencies in tens nanohertz and the decay of metastable states with lifetimes by many orders exceeding those in previous simulations. Good agreement of simulated results with low-temperature analytic theories has been established. Though the algorithm acceleration has been shown to enhance with lowering temperature, the hysteresis has been simulated at moderately low temperatures of practical interest estimated to cover the range from below the room temperature up to temperatures used in hyperthermia applications.

Abstract: In 1975, two papers were published that together sparked major new directions, conceptual, mathematical and practically applicable, in several previously disparate fields of science. In this short review, we expose key aspects of their thinking, implementations and implications, along with a selection of further crucial and consequential developments.

Title: Magnetic Circular Dichroism at the Oxygen K edge in Microcrystals of Spinels Grown on Ru(0001)
Authors: A. Mandziak, V. Sosa, P. Nita, L. Martín-García, J. E. Prieto, M. Foerster, M. A. Niño, L. Aballe, C. Granados-Miralles, A. Quesada, C. Tejera-Centeno, S. Gallego, J. de la Figuera
Abstract: We have measured the circular magnetic dichroism in the x-ray absorption at the K-edge of oxygen in microcrystals of different spinel oxides. The microcrystals are islands of micrometric size and nanometric thickness, grown on Ru(0001) substrates using high-temperature oxygen-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The domains observed in the oxygen K-edge dichroism have the same distribution and orientation as those observed in x-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the L$_{3}$ edge of the octahedral cations. Integrating the area from a single domain, x-ray magnetic circular dichroic spectra of oxygen were measured and, by the application of the K-edge sum rule, non vanishing orbital magnetic moments aligned with the octahedral cations were found. Density functional theory calculations, which did not show any orbital moment at the oxygen anions, indicate that the energy ranges where oxygen dichroism is observed correspond to those with significant hybridization with the cations d bands. They also show a correlation between the magnitude of the measured value of the oxygen orbital moment and the theoretical one for the cations, and demonstrate that this trend is preserved in the presence of Fe excess in the samples. Our experimental XMCD suggest, following the DFT calculations, that the origin of the oxygen magnetic moment lies in the hybridization of the oxygen unoccupied p-derived bands with the cation bands, mostly with the d-derived ones.

Title: Frustrated vacancy ordering creates novel quantum properties in Kutinaite, $\mathrm{Ag}_{6}\mathrm{Cu}_{14.4}\mathrm{As}_7$
Authors: Kim-Khuong Huynh, Rasmus Baden Stubkjær, Ventrapati Pavankumar, Emilie Skytte Vosegaard, Karl Omer Rimon Juul, Kasper Rasmussen Borup, Yong P. Chen, Bo Brummerstedt Iversen
Abstract: Ideal crystals are fully ordered, but real-world crystals always contain defects breaking translational symmetry. Random defects in crystals have important implications and they e.g. provide the foundation for semiconductor-based electronic devices. Structurally correlated defects introduce an additional level of complexity, which may lead to novel materials properties, but rationalization of relations between correlated disorder and the emergent material properties are very rare. Here we report that the defect structure of the mineral Kutinaite, Ag6Cu14.4As7, exhibits unprecedented metallic diamagnetism, a hallmark of non-trivial electronic states that require delicate symmetrical protection. Using a combination of X-ray scattering methodologies, simulations, and physical property measurements, we deduced and verified subtle frustrated vacancy ordering of the Cu sublattice when cooling crystals below ~300 K. The vacancy frustration in Kutinaite leads to unique quantum properties, and our study calls for a reconsideration of the role of vacancies as quasi-chemical species in crystals.

Title: Decoupling Local Electrostatic Potential and Temperature-Driven Atomistic Forming Mechanisms in TaOx/HfO2-Based ReRAMs using Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Simanta Lahkar, Valeria Bragaglia, Behnaz Bagheri, Donato Francesco Falcone, Matteo Galetta, Marilyne Sousa, Aida Todri-Sanial
Abstract: Resistive random access memories (ReRAMs) with a bilayer TaOx/HfO2 stack structure have been shown to possess uniquely promising resistive switching characteristics. However, the key atomistic forming mechanisms and the physical processes that govern the behavior of this kind of device remain to be clarified. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the physical mechanisms underlying its forming at the atomistic level through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using an extended charge equilibration scheme to describe the effects of applied voltage with the charge transfer ionic potential formalism. The displacement of the tantalum ions was found to be the highest, followed by that of the hafnium ions, in response to a sufficiently high applied voltage across the electrodes, whereas the oxygen ions had a relatively minor voltage-driven response. This led to the formation of a tantalum-depleted, oxygen-rich zone near the positive top electrode acting as the anode and the clustering of oxygen vacancies that nucleated into the filament near the negative bottom electrode, or the cathode. This process resulted in partial shielding of the bulk dielectric from the applied voltage. We found a minimum threshold voltage was required to initiate vacancy clustering to form the filament. Filament growth during forming is attributed to a localized mechanism, driven by thermally activated generation of oxygen vacancy defects, which get stabilized by the local electric fields near the edge of the nucleated filament at the cathode.

Title: Crystal Growth & Physical Property Characterization of Mixed Topological Insulator BiSbTe$_3$
Authors: Dinesh Kumar (Banasthali), Kapil Kumar (CSIR-NPL), N. K. Karn (CSIR-NPL), Ganesh Gurjar (Ramajas - DU), V.P.S. Awana (CSIR-NPL), Sudesh (Banasthali)
Abstract: This article reports the synthesis of a single crystalline mixed topological insulator (TI) BiSbTe$_3$ and its detailed structural and magneto-transport properties. The single crystalline samples of BiSbTe$_3$ are grown by the melt-growth process and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and Raman spectroscopy. The single crystal XRD peaks dictated the growth direction along the c-axis. The Raman spectrum elucidated the characteristic peaks of the mixed topological insulator. The broadening of Raman peaks exhibited the formation of Te-Bi-Te and Te-Sb-Te bonds and associated vibrational modes. The single crystals are characterized by magneto-transport measurements down to 2 K and up to 14 Tesla transverse magnetic field. The residual resistance ratio (R200 K/R0 K) is found to be 3.64, which endorses the metallic nature of the synthesized crystal. The relative resistance turns out to be higher for the mixed TI than the pure TIs i.e., Bi$_2$Te$_3$ or Sb$_2$Te$_3$. The lower Debye temperature (82.64 K) of BiSbTe$_3$ connotes the presence of effective electron-phonon interaction at quite low temperatures in comparison to pure TI, which explains the observed suppression in magnetoresistance (MR) for the mixed TI. At 2 K, an MR of 150 percent is observed for BiSbTe$_3$, which is suppressed in contrast to the pure TIs i.e., Bi$_2$Te$_3$ or Sb$_2$Te$_3$. Though the MR% is suppressed significantly, its non-saturating linear behavior indicates the topological nature of the studied mixed TI. The modified Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka (HLN) equation analysis of magneto-conductivity of mixed TI revealed that the conductivity has not only a surface states driven 2D component but also contributions from the bulk charge carriers and quantum scattering.

Title: First-Passage-Time Asymmetry for Biased Run-and-Tumble Processes
Authors: Yonathan Sarmiento, Benjamin Walter, Debraj Das, Samvit Mahapatra, Édgar Roldán, Rosemary J. Harris
Abstract: We explore first-passage phenomenology for biased active processes with a renewal-type structure, focusing in particular on paradigmatic run-and-tumble models in both discrete and continuous state spaces. In general, we show there is no symmetry between distributions of first-passage times to symmetric barriers positioned in and against the bias direction; however, we give conditions for such a duality to be restored asymptotically (in the limit of a large barrier distance) and highlight connections to the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation relation and the method of images. Our general trajectory arguments are supported by exact analytical calculations of first-passage-time distributions for asymmetric run-and-tumble processes escaping from an interval of arbitrary width, and these calculations are confirmed with high accuracy via extensive numerics. Furthermore, we quantify the degree of violation of first-passage duality using Kullback-Leibler divergence and signal-to-noise ratios associated with the first-passage times to the two barriers. We reveal an intriguing dependence of such measures of first-passage asymmetry on the underlying tumbling dynamics which may inspire inference techniques based on first-passage-time statistics in active systems.

Title: Localized atomic vibrations caused by point impurity in long chains of noble gas atoms adsorbed in outer grooves of carbon nanobundle
Authors: E.V. Manzhelii, S.B. Feodosyev
Abstract: The characteristics of discrete vibrational levels caused by a point three-parameter substitutional impurity in long linear chain of inert gas atoms adsorbed in groove on the surface of carbon nanobundle are studied. The impurity atom differs from the atoms of the chain in the following parameters: the mass, the parameter of interaction with neighboring atoms and the parameter of interaction with the substrate. Analytical expressions for the frequencies of the localized vibrations and the intensities of these vibrations are obtained. The conditions for the existence of localized vibrations both below and above the band of the quasi-continuous spectrum of the adsorbed chain are also obtained.

Title: Dynamical thermal near-field routing with the non-reciprocal Weyl semi-metal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$
Authors: A. Naeimi, S.-A. Biehs
Abstract: We demonstrate theoretically the non-reciprocal heating dynamics of two nanoparticles in the vicinity of a substrate all made of the ferromagnetic Weyl semi-metal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$. We show that the thermal routing effect is due to a spin-spin coupling mechanism between the nanoparticle resonances and the non-reciprocal surface modes of the substrate. Our numerical results indicate that the non-reciprocal heating effect is on the order of 22.5% of the applied temperature differences. This strong rounting effect paves the way for first experimental realizations employing Weyl semi-metals and applications in nanoscale thermal management.

Title: Strain-induced manipulation of non-collinear antiferromagnets
Authors: Mithuss Tharmalingam, Feodor Svetlanov Konomaev, Kjetil M. D. Hals
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in harnessing non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) for applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics. A key requirement for their practical use is the ability to control the spin order in a reliable and tunable manner. In this work, we investigate how the spin order in kagome antiferromagnets -- an important class of NCAFMs -- can be manipulated via strain. Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive an effective action for the kagome antiferromagnet that captures the coupling between the spin order and the system's strain tensor. At the microscopic level, this coupling arises from strain-induced modifications of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and exchange interactions. Using this effective description, we explore two strain-driven phenomena: (1) strain-induced switching of the antiferromagnetic spin order and (2) the piezomagnetic response. We numerically show that strain facilitates thermally assisted switching between spin configurations of opposite chirality. Specifically, we find that uniform tensile and compressive strain govern both the average switching time and the preferred switching direction between chiral states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that strain induces a net magnetization and provide an experimentally testable prediction of this effect for a typical NCAFM. Our results provide a theoretical framework for modeling strain-induced manipulation of kagome antiferromagnets, underscoring strain as a promising route for functional control of NCAFMs.

Title: Accelerated ultrafast demagnetization of an interlayer-exchange-coupled Co/Mn/Co trilayer
Authors: Jendrik Gördes, Ivar Kumberg, Chowdhury S. Awsaf, Marcel Walter, Tauqir Shinwari, Sangeeta Thakur, Sangeeta Sharma, Christian Schüßler-Langeheine, Niko Pontius, Wolfgang Kuch
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of an interlayer-exchange-coupled Co/Mn/Co trilayer system after excitation with an ultrafast optical pump. We probe element- and time-resolved ferromagnetic order by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism in resonant reflectivity. We observe an accelerated Co demagnetization time in the case of weak total parallel interlayer coupling at 9.5 ML Mn thickness for antiparallel alignment of both Co layers compared to parallel alignment as well as for parallel alignment in the case of strong parallel interlayer coupling at 11 ML of Mn. From ab initio time-dependent density functional theory calculations, we conclude that optically induced intersite spin transfer of spin-polarized electrons from Co into Mn acts as a decay channel to enhance and accelerate ultrafast demagnetization. This spin transfer can only take place in case of a collinear Mn spin structure. We argue that this is the case for antiparallel alignment of both Co layers at 9.5 ML Mn thickness and parallel alignment in case of 11 ML of Mn. Our results point out that an antiferromagnetic spacer layer and its spin structure have a significant effect on the magnetization dynamics of adjacent ferromagnetic layers. Our findings provide further insight into fundamental mechanisms of ultrafast demagnetization and may lead to improve dynamics in multilayered systems for faster optical switching of magnetic order.

Abstract: Exploiting quantum interference of charge carriers, epitaxial graphene grown on silicon carbide emerges as a game-changing platform for ultra-sensitive bolometric sensing, featuring an intrinsic resistive thermometer response unmatched by any other graphene variant. By achieving low and uniform carrier densities, we have accessed a new regime of strong charge localization that dramatically reduces thermal conductance, significantly enhancing bolometer performance. Here we present scalable graphene-based bolometers engineered for detecting GHz-range photons, a frequency domain essential for superconducting quantum processors. Our devices deliver a state-of-the-art noise equivalent power of 40 zW$/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ at $T=40~$mK, enabled by the steep temperature dependence of thermal conductance, $G_{\rm th}\sim T^4$ for $T<100~$mK. These results establish epitaxial graphene bolometers as versatile and low-back-action detectors, unlocking new possibilities for next-generation quantum processors and pioneering investigations into the thermodynamics and thermalization pathways of strongly entangled quantum systems.

Title: Hydrogen defects and band alignment in metal-organic frameworks
Authors: Khang Hoang
Abstract: Band alignment, namely the prediction of band-edge positions of semiconductors and insulators in aqueous solutions, is an important problem in physics and chemistry. Such a prediction is especially challenging for complex materials. Here we present an approach to align band structure of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on an absolute energy scale which can be used for direct comparison with experiments. Hydrogen defects are used as probes into the chemical bonding of the covalently bonded hybrid materials. An effective defect energy level, defined as the average of the charge-state transition levels of the defects at the linker and at the secondary building unit, is identified as a charge neutrality level to align band structures. This level captures subtle chemical details at both the organic and inorganic building blocks and provides results that are in agreement with experiments in a wide range of different MOFs. We also compare with results obtained from using other approaches involving surface calculations and average pore-center electrostatic potentials.

Abstract: We demonstrate that a conventional hollow conductor waveguide filled with a material exhibiting the coexistence of chiral magnetic and anomalous quantum Hall effects supports the propagation of transverse electromagnetic modes within its interior. This simple setup provides an optically feasible and direct method to probe the simultaneous presence of these phenomena, potentially enabling the detection of the axion field in the condensed matter realm.

Title: Weak localization as probe of spin-orbit-induced spin-split bands in bilayer graphene proximity coupled to WSe$_2$
Authors: E. Icking, F. Wörtche, A.W. Cummings, A. Wörtche, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, C. Volk, B. Beschoten, C. Stampfer
Abstract: Proximity coupling of bilayer graphene (BLG) to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offers a promising route to engineer gate-tunable spin-orbit coupling (SOC) while preserving BLG's exceptional electronic properties. This tunability arises from the layer-asymmetric electronic structure of gapped BLG, where SOC acts predominantly on the layer in contact with the TMD. Here, we present high-quality BLG/WSe$_2$ devices with a proximity-induced SOC gap and excellent electrostatic control. Operating in a quasi-ballistic regime, our double-gated heterostructures allow to form gate-defined p-n-p cavities and show clear weak anti-localization (WAL) features consistent with Rashba-type SOC. At lower hole densities, a transition to weak localization (WL) is observed, signaling transport through a single spin-split valence band. These findings - in agreement with calculations - provide direct spectroscopic evidence of proximity-induced spin-split band in BLG and underscore the potential of BLG/TMD heterostructures for spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies.

Title: Nematic ordering in active fluids driven by substrate deformations: Mechanisms and patterning regimes
Authors: Varun Venkatesh, Amin Doostmohammadi
Abstract: The interplay between active matter and its environment is central to understanding emergent behavior in biological and synthetic systems. Here, we show that coupling active nematic flows to small-amplitude deformations of a compliant substrate can fundamentally reorganize the system's dynamics. Using a model that combines active nematohydrodynamics with substrate mechanics, we find that contractile active nematics-normally disordered in flat geometries-undergo a sharp transition to long-range orientational order when the environment is deformable. This environmentally induced ordering is robust and enables distinct patterning regimes, with wrinkle morphologies reflecting the nature of the active stresses. Our results reveal a generic mechanism by which mechanical feedback from soft environments can lead to ordering in active systems.

Title: Structural Stability of Sulfur Depleted MoS2
Authors: Ygor M. Jaques, Cristiano F. Woellner, Lucas M. Sassi, Marcelo L. Pereira Jr, Luiz A. Ribeiro Jr, Pulickel M. Ajayan, Douglas S. Galvão
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly monolayer MoS2, have received increased attention in materials science and have been exploited in diverse applications from photonics to catalysis. Defects in TMDs play a crucial role in modulating their properties, and understanding defect-induced dynamics is of great importance. This study investigates the dynamics of sulfur depletion in defective monolayer MoS2, which yields stable MoS monolayers. Various defect sizes, temperature regimes, and substrate effects were investigated. Through comprehensive classical molecular (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics (MD) and ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations, we elucidate the dynamics of sulfur vacancy formation in MoS2 lattices. After removing all sulfur atoms from the top layer, several sulfur atoms from the bottom layer spontaneously migrate to the top layer as a response to increase structural stability, thus creating a MoSx alloy. These findings deepen our understanding of defect dynamics in TMDs, offering valuable insights into the controlled engineering of their properties for nanotechnology applications.

Title: Magnetoimpedance properties of CoNbZr, multilayer CoNbZr/Au and multilayer NiFe/Au thin films
Authors: Indujan Sivanesarajah, Leon Abelmann, Uwe Hartmann
Abstract: Thin-film magnetic sensors using the giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) effect show great promise for sensitive low-field magnetic measurements. Optimising sensor performance requires a thorough understanding of the properties of various soft magnetic materials. This study examines the electric, magnetic, and GMI properties of sputtered single-layer amorphous CoNbZr, multilayer amorphous CoNbZr/Au, and crystalline NiFe/Au thin films. GMI measurements reveal distinct ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequencies: 1.4 GHz for CoNbZr, 0.7 GHz for CoNbZr/Au, and 0.5 GHz for NiFe/Au. Au interlayers improve the GMI response, increasing the GMI ratio by 50% and reducing FMR frequency compared to single-layer CoNbZr. The highest GMI ratio of 300% occurs in a 20 $\mu$m x 5000 $\mu$m CoNbZr/Au strip at 1.8 GHz under 2 mT, while NiFe/Au exhibits 280% at 4 mT. These differences are linked to variations in in-plane demagnetising factors and saturation magnetisations, emphasising the role of material and geometry in GMI sensor performance.

Title: Finite-time scaling on low-dimensional map bifurcations
Authors: Daniel A. Martin, Qian-Yuan Tang, Dante R. Chialvo
Abstract: Recent work has introduced the concept of finite-time scaling to characterize bifurcation diagrams at finite times in deterministic discrete dynamical systems, drawing an analogy with finite-size scaling used to study critical behavior in finite systems. In this work, we extend the finite-time scaling approach in several key directions. First, we present numerical results for 1D maps exhibiting period-doubling bifurcations and discontinuous transitions, analyzing selected paradigmatic examples. We then define two observables, the finite-time susceptibility and the finite-time Lyapunov exponent, that also display consistent scaling near bifurcation points. The method is further generalized to special cases of 2D maps including the 2D Chialvo map, capturing its bifurcation between a fixed point and a periodic orbit, while accounting for discontinuities and asymmetric periodic orbits. These results underscore fundamental connections between temporal and spatial observables in complex systems, suggesting new avenues for studying complex dynamical behavior.

Title: Emergent Dynamics of Active Systems on Curved Environments
Authors: Euan D. Mackay, Giulia Janzen, D. A. Matoz Fernandez, Rastko Sknepnek
Abstract: Curvature plays a central role in the proper function of many biological processes. With active matter being a standard framework for understanding many aspects of the physics of life, it is natural to ask what effect curvature has on the collective behaviour of active matter. In this paper, we use the classical theory of surfaces to explore the active motion of self-propelled agents confined to move on a smooth curved two-dimensional surface embedded in Euclidean space. Even without interactions and alignment, the motion is non-trivially affected by the presence of curvature, leading to effects akin, e.g.\ to gravitational lensing and tidal forces. Such effects can lead to intermittent trapping of particles and profoundly affect their flocking behaviour.

Title: Spin-dependent transport through edge states in 2D semi-Dirac materials with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and band inversion
Authors: Marta García-Olmos, Yuriko Baba, Alexander López, Mario Amado, Rafael A. Molina
Abstract: We investigate the bulk-boundary correspondence in two-dimensional type-I semi-Dirac materials with band inversion and Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Employing a dimensional reduction framework, we identify the Zak phase along the quadratically dispersing direction as a topological invariant that captures the presence of edge states. In the non-trivial topological regime, systems with finite width exhibit energy-dependent edge states that are topologically protected only at specific momenta. At kx equal to zero, symmetry-protected edge states emerge, analogous to the Rashba-free case. At finite kx, the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and band structure gives rise to spin-dependent edge states, localized on specific edges based on its spin and particle-hole character. We compute spin-resolved conductance through these edge channels and observe robust, tunable oscillations attributable to spin precession induced by the effective Rashba magnetic field. These results reveal how spin-orbit interactions enrich the edge physics of semi-Dirac systems and provide a platform for spintronic control in anisotropic topological materials.

Title: First principles computations of the Stark shift of a defect-bound exciton: the case of the T center in silicon
Authors: Louis Alaerts, Yihuang Xiong, Sinéad M. Griffin, Geoffroy Hautier
Abstract: The T center in silicon has recently drawn a lot of attention for its potential in quantum information science. The sensitivity of the zero-phonon line (ZPL) to electrical field was recently investigated by a combination of different experimental methods but there is still no first principles study on the Stark shift of the T center. Dealing with the defect-bound exciton nature of the excited state is particularly challenging using density functional theory because of the large spatial delocalization associated with the wavefunction. Here, we tackle this issue by performing a convergence study over the supercell size. We obtain an exciton binding energy of 28.5meV, in good agreement with experimental results. We then calculate the Stark shift through the dipole moment change of the ZPL transition of the T center using the modern theory of polarization formalism and find a modest linear coefficient of $\Delta \mu$=0.79D along X and $\Delta \mu$=0.03D along Y. We discuss our results in light of the recent experimental measurements of the Stark shift. Our analysis suggests that bound-exciton defects could be particularly sensitive to local field effect as a result of their large spatial extent.

Title: Emergent boundary supersymmetry in a one dimensional superconductor
Authors: Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, Patrick Azaria, Colin Rylands, Natan Andrei
Abstract: The interplay between bulk properties and boundary conditions in one-dimensional quantum systems, gives rise to many intriguing phenomena. These include the emergence of zero energy modes which are of significant interest to a variety of fields. In this work we investigate the presence of such zero modes in cases where the boundary conditions are dynamical and arise due to the coupling to some quantum degrees of freedom. In particular, we study a one-dimensional spin-singlet superconductor, modeled by the Gross-Neveu field theory, coupled to spin $\frac{1}{2}$ magnetic impurities at its boundaries via a spin-exchange interaction. We solve the model exactly for arbitrary values of the bulk and the impurity coupling strengths using nested coordinate Bethe ansatz and show that the system exhibits a rich boundary phase structure. For a range of couplings, the low energy degrees of freedom form irreducible representations of the supersymmetric $spl(2,1)\otimes spl(2,1)$ algebra which become degenerate at a specific point, indicating the emergence of supersymmetry in the low energy boundary degrees of freedom. We show that at the supersymmetric point there exist exact zero energy modes that map one ground state with the other. We express these in terms of the generators of the algebra.

Title: Accurate grain boundary plane distributions for textured microstructures from stereological analysis of orthogonal two-dimensional electron backscatter diffraction orientation maps
Authors: Martin Folwarczny, Ao Li, Rushvi Shah, Aaron Chote, Alexandra C. Austin, Yimin Zhu, Gregory S. Rohrer, Michael A. Jackson, Souhardh Kotakadi, Katharina Marquardt
Abstract: We present a method for obtaining qualitatively accurate grain boundary plane distributions (GBPD) for textured microstructures using a stereological calculation applied to two-dimensional electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) orientation maps. Stereology, applied to 2D EBSD orientation maps, is currently the fastest method of obtaining GBPDs. Existing stereological methods are not directly applicable to textured microstructures because of the biased viewing perspectives for different grain boundary types supplied from a single planar orientation map. The method presented in this work successfully removes part of this bias by combining data from three orthogonal EBSD orientation maps for stereology. This is shown here to produce qualitatively correct GBPDs for heavily textured synthetic microstructures with hexagonal and tetragonal crystal symmetries. Synthetic microstructures were generated to compare the stereological GBPD to a known ground truth, as the true GBPD could be obtained from a triangular mesh of the full grain boundary network in 3D. The triangle mesh data contained all five macroscopic parameters to fully describe the grain boundary structure. It was observed that our stereological method overestimated the GBPD anisotropy. However, qualitative analysis of the GBPD remains useful. Furthermore, it was found that combining data from three orthogonal sections gives reliable results when sectioning the texture's primary axes.

Title: Ultrafast electron dynamics upon above band-gap excitation in epitaxial LaFeO$_3$(001) thin films
Authors: Friederike Elisa Wührl, Antonia Rieche, Anne Oelschläger, Kathrin Dörr, Wolf Widdra
Abstract: Strong electron correlations in perovskite oxides give rise to rich and often unexpected electronic phenomena. In this study, we present a comprehensive surface-science investigation of epitaxial thin films of the charge-transfer insulator LaFeO$_3$(001). The characterization includes low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and photoemission spectroscopy. We map both the occupied and unoccupied electronic states using two-photon photoemission (2PPE) spectroscopy. Furthermore, we probe electron dynamics through an ultraviolet-ultraviolet (UV-UV) pump-probe experiment, exciting electrons from hybridized O~$2p$/Fe $3d$ states to Fe minority-spin states above the band gap. Our results reveal three distinct unoccupied states, which we assign to Fe $t_{2g\downarrow}$, Fe $e_{g\downarrow}$, and La $5d$ orbitals. Notably, the conduction band minimum exhibits a biexponential decay with time constants of 39\,fs and 1100\,fs, suggesting the presence of two independent decay pathways.

Title: Closed-form survival probabilities for biased random walks at arbitrary step number
Authors: Debendro Mookerjee, Sarah Kostinski
Abstract: We present a closed-form expression for the survival probability of a biased random walker to first reach a target site on a 1D lattice. The expression holds for any step number $N$ and is computationally faster than non-closed-form results in the literature. Because our result is exact even in the intermediate step number range, it serves as a tool to study convergence to the large $N$ limit. We also obtain a closed-form expression for the probability of last passage. In contrast to predictions of the large $N$ approximation, the new expression reveals a critical value of the bias beyond which the tail of the last-passage probability decays monotonically.

Abstract: Circular dichroism spectroscopy is known to provide important insights into the interplay of different degrees of freedom in quantum materials, and yet spectroscopic study of the optoelectronic responses of quantum materials to structured optical fields, such as light with finite spin and orbital angular momentum, has not yet been widely explored, particularly at cryogenic temperature. Here we demonstrate the design and application of a novel instrument that integrates scanning spectroscopic photocurrent measurements with structured light of controlled spin and orbital angular momentum. For structured photons with wavelengths between 500 nm to 700 nm, this instrument can perform spatially resolved photocurrent measurements of two-dimensional materials or thin crystals under magnetic fields up to $\pm$ 14 Tesla, at temperatures from 300 K down to 3 K, with either spin angular momentum $\pm \hbar$ ororbital angular momentum $\pm \ell \hbar$ (where $\ell$=1,2,3... is the topological charge), and over a (35 $\times$ 25) $\mu m^2$ area with ~ 1 $\mu m$ spatial resolution. These capabilities of the instrument are exemplified by magneto-photocurrent spectroscopic measurements of monolayer 2H-$MoS_2$ field-effect transistors, which not only reveal the excitonic spectra but also demonstrate monotonically increasing photocurrents with increasing |$\ell $| as well as excitonic Zeeman splitting and an enhanced Landé g-factor due to the enhanced formation of intervalley dark excitons under magnetic field. These studies thus demonstrate the versatility of the scanning photocurrent spectrometry for investigating excitonic physics, optical selection rules, and optoelectronic responses of novel quantum materials and engineered quantum devices to structured light.

Title: Study of the structural and electronic properties of the Heusler Co2FeGe alloy by DFT approach
Authors: A. Jamraoui, Y. Selmani, A. Jabar, L. Bahmad
Abstract: In this work we reported the structural and electronic properties of the Heusler compound Co2FeGe using the AKAI-KKR code under the GGA approximation. We established that this material presents not only magnetic character but also has a metallic behavior. Our calculations have been conducted using the DFT method in the framework of the AKAI-KKR code. This study enabled us to define certain characteristics and initial parameters for creating a model of the system. The method used allowed us to apply fundamental concepts to the studied system in the form of modeling. The main results, of the studied Heusler compound Co2FeGe are: i) this material is magnetic; ii) The band structure of the material predicts a metallic character; iii) the origin of magnetism comes mainly from the transition metals Co and Fe atoms. These results, assure that the studied quaternary Heusler Co2FeGe stands for a strong candidate for different spintronics applications.

Title: Nematicity in iron pnictides: phase competition and emergent symmetry
Authors: Yiming Wang, Changle Liu, Shan Wu, Jianda Wu, Qimiao Si, Rong Yu
Abstract: The phase diagram of iron-based superconductors contains a host of electronic orders, which are intimately connected with their superconductivity. Here we analyze the fluctuations of one type of nematic order in another. Our analysis leads to an emergent U(1) symmetry at a first-order transition between a nematic phase and a $C_4$-symmetric charge-ordered phase. We characterize the continuous symmetry in terms of a certain hidden Lie algebra that links the different orders. This emergent symmetry leads to a Goldstone mode at the transition and causes softening of excitations in the nematic and charge sectors near the transition. The underlying physics bears a resemblance to the anisotropic XZ spin model, with the nematic order and charge $C_4$ order parameters playing the roles of the $x$ and $z$ components of the magnetization vector, respectively. We provide the experimental evidence in support of the proposed effects, and discuss the general implications of our results for the physics of iron-based superconductors and other correlated systems.

Title: Active Gaussian Network Model: a non-equilibrium description of protein fluctuations and allosteric behavior
Authors: Giulio Costantini, Lorenzo Caprini, Umberto Marini Bettolo Marconi, Fabio Cecconi
Abstract: Understanding the link between structure and function in proteins is fundamental in molecular biology and proteomics. A central question in this context is whether allostery - where the binding of a molecule at one site affects the activity of a distant site - emerges as a further manifestation of the intricate interplay between structure, function, and intrinsic dynamics. This study explores how allosteric regulation is modified when intrinsic protein dynamics operate under out-of-equilibrium conditions. To this purpose, we introduce a simple nonequilibrium model of protein dynamics, inspired by active matter systems, by generalizing the widely employed Gaussian Network Model (GNM) to incorporate non-thermal effects. Our approach underscores the advantage of framing allostery as a causal process by using, as a benchmark system, the second PDZ domain of the human phosphatase hPT1E that mediates protein-protein interactions. We employ causal indicators, such as response functions and transfer entropy, to identify the network of PDZ2 residues through which the allosteric signal propagates across the protein structure. These indicators reveal specific regions that align well with experimental observations. Furthermore, our results suggest that deviations from purely thermal fluctuations can significantly influence allosteric communication by introducing distinct timescales and memory effects. This influence is particularly relevant when the allosteric response unfolds on timescales incompatible with relaxation to equilibrium. Accordingly, non-thermal fluctuations may become essential for accurately describing protein responses to ligand binding and developing a comprehensive understanding of allosteric regulation.

Title: Unifying same- and different-material particle charging through stochastic scaling
Authors: Holger Grosshans, Gizem Ozler, Simon Jantač
Abstract: Triboelectric charging of insulating particles through contact is critical in diverse physical and engineering processes, from dust storms and volcanic eruptions to industrial powder handling. However, repeated experiments revealed counterintuitive charge patterns, including variable impact charge under identical conditions, charge sign reversal with repeated impacts, and bipolar charging of differently sized particles. Existing computational models cannot predict these patterns; they either rely on oversimplified heuristics or require inaccessible detailed surface properties. We present a physics-based stochastic particle charging (SPC) model integrating experimentally characterized charging statistics into multiphase simulations. The model unifies same-material (particle-particle) and different-material (particle-wall) charging in a single framework, grounded in a stochastic closure by the mean, variance, skewness, and minimum impact charge of a single reference experiment. Implemented in a Lagrangian-Eulerian CFD solver, the SPC model takes less than 0.01% of the CPU time when simulating 300 000 insulating particles, charging during millions of same- and different-material contacts, transported by turbulent wall-bounded flows. By scaling the statistical parameters of the reference impact to each collision, the new model reproduces the complex charging patterns observed in experiments without requiring surface-level first-principles inputs. The SPC model offers a physically grounded route to massive-scale simulations of electrostatic effects across many fields of particle-laden flows.

Title: Bubble-Burst Synthesis of Ammonia, Amino Acids, and Urea Under Ambient, Catalyst-Free Conditions
Authors: Jerome J. Cuomo, Ian Goodall, C. Richard Guarnieri, Gennaro (Jerry)Cuomo, Stephen Hudak
Abstract: This study introduces a catalyst-free, ambient-temperature method for synthesizing nitrogen-based compounds critical to fertilizer production, including ammonia, urea, ammonium salts, and amino acids. The process relies on bubble-burst-induced microenvironments, where gas bubbles undergo rapid growth and collapse, releasing intense localized energy sufficient to dissociate nitrogen and water molecules. These high-energy zones produce reactive species, including atomic hydrogen (H*) that facilitate nitrogen fixation and drive subsequent chemical transformations without needing catalysts or elevated conditions. Experimental validation using colorimetric assays, Raman spectroscopy, and microscopy confirms the in situ formation of ammonia and its downstream conversion into structurally relevant compounds, including peptide-like assemblies. The system supports reaction tuning through dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) or organic acids and can be enhanced by low-energy inputs such as UV or ultrasound. Its simplicity, modularity, and ability to operate without external infrastructure offer a practical and scalable platform for decentralized fertilizer generation and sustainable biochemical production.

Title: Roughening and dynamics of an electric flux string in a (2+1)D lattice gauge theory
Authors: Francesco Di Marcantonio, Sunny Pradhan, Sofia Vallecorsa, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Enrique Rico Ortega
Abstract: We investigate the roughening transition in the pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory in (2+1) dimensions. Using numerical simulations with matrix product states, we explore the static and dynamical properties of an electric flux string between two static charges as the coupling is varied and approaches the deconfinement phase transition from the confined phase. Within the roughening region, we obtain the universal Lüscher correction to the confining potential and observe the expected restoration of rotational symmetry. Our simulations of the out-of-equilibrium evolution of a string reveal that the growth of the entanglement entropy of the state and the string width exhibit qualitatively different behavior in the roughening region compared to the deeply confined one. In particular, we find that the rate of entropy growth is consistent with an effective description of the string excitations by a bosonic model in the roughening phase.

Title: Critical Dynamics of Random Surfaces and Multifractal Scaling
Authors: Christof Schmidhuber
Abstract: The critical dynamics of conformal field theories on random surfaces is investigated beyond the dynamics of the overall area and the genus. It is found that the evolution of the order parameter in physical time is a multifractal random walk. Accordingly, the higher moments of time variations of the order parameter exhibit multifractal scaling. The series of Hurst exponents is computed and illustrated with the examples of the Ising-, 3-state-Potts-, and general minimal models on a random surface. Models are identified that can replicate the observed multifractal scaling in financial markets.

Title: Modelling bulk mechanical effects in a planar cellular monolayer
Authors: Natasha Cowley, Sarah Woolner, Oliver E. Jensen
Abstract: We use a three-dimensional formulation of the cell vertex model to describe the mechanical properties of a confluent planar monolayer of prismatic cells. Treating cell height as a degree of freedom, we reduce the model to a two-dimensional form. We show how bulk effects, associated with cell volume and total surface area, lead to coupling between energy variations arising from changes in cell apical area and apical perimeter, a feature missing from standard implementations of the two-dimensional vertex model. The model identifies four independent mechanisms by which cells can lose in-plane rigidity, relating to variations in total cell surface area, the strength of lateral adhesion, and constrictive forces at the apical cortex. The model distinguishes bulk from in-plane stresses, and identifies two primary measures of cell shear stress. In the rigid regime, the model shows how lateral crowding in a disordered isolated monolayer can lead to cell elongation towards the monolayer centre. We examine loss of in-plane rigidity in a disordered monolayer and connect isolated patches of stiffness that persist during the rigidity transition to the spectrum of a Laplacian matrix. This approach enables bulk mechanical effects in an epithelium to be captured within a two-dimensional framework.

Title: Correlated emission of electron-current waves
Authors: Shane P. Kelly, Eric Kleinherbers, Yanyan Zhu, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak
Abstract: Correlated emission of light offer a potential avenue for entanglement generation between atomic spins, with potential application for sensing and quantum memory. In this work, we investigate the conditions for the correlated emission by color centers into an electronic bath of conduction electrons. Unlike emission into bosonic modes, electrons can absorb energy via two-particle processes across a large range of length scales. We find that two length scales are particularly relevant: one set by the Fermi velocity and the frequency of the color centers $v_F/\Delta$, and the other set by the Fermi wavelength $\lambda_F \ll v_F/\Delta$. Subradiance requires emitters to be spaced at a distance closer than the Fermi wavelength, while superradiance requires spacing less than $\sqrt{\lambda_F v_F/\Delta}$, so long as the emitters are initialized with coherence. We show that the emitted current burst has a spiral form, and we discuss the experimental possibility to observe correlated dissipation by color-center qubits coupled to electronic environments.

Title: The 'Brazil-nut effect' in bidisperse particle laden flow on an incline
Authors: Jack Luong, Sarah Cassie Burnett, Andrea L. Bertozzi
Abstract: We study bidisperse suspensions -- suspensions where there are two particle species of the same density but different sizes -- of a viscous fluid on an incline. We use a lubrication theory/thin film model to form a hyperbolic system of three conservation laws for the height and particle volume fractions. The model predicts, over a range of parameters, that the larger particles rise to the top of the layer, consistent with the well-known `Brazil-nut effect' for granular media. The model predicts well-separated fronts of the two species of particles, behind a clear fluid front, at lower inclination angles and volume fractions. This corresponds to a triple shock structure in the system of conservations. At higher inclination angles and volume fractions the particles congregate at a high concentration at the leading front corresponding to a singular shock in the model. We find excellent agreement between theory and experiments in terms of the overall dynamic structures as the parameters vary.

Title: All-optical mapping of ultrafast carrier dynamics in a Dirac semimetal
Authors: Zhaopin Chen, Camilo Granados, Ido Nisim, Daniel Kroeger, Ofer Neufeld, Marcelo F. Ciappina, Michael Krüger
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG), the hallmark effect of attosecond science, is a nonperturbative nonlinear process leading to the emission of high harmonic light from gases and solids. In gases, extreme driving laser pulse intensities can deplete the ground state, suppressing harmonic emission during the trailing edge of the pulse. Here, we report pronounced ultrafast depletion dynamics during HHG in a gapless Dirac semimetal -- highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Remarkably, HOPG supports nonperturbative harmonic generation at laser intensities as low as $10^{10}$ W cm$^{-2}$, facilitated by its vanishing bandgap. Using two-color spectroscopy, we reveal the excitation dynamics of Dirac electron-hole pairs as it affects the emission of harmonics during the presence of the driving laser pulse. Notably, valence band depletion near the Dirac points leads to a marked suppression of interband harmonics and induces measurable temporal shifts. These observations are supported by simulations based on semiconductor Bloch equations. Our findings uncover a new regime of strong-field light-matter interaction in gapless solids and establish HHG as a sensitive, all-optical probe of ultrafast carrier dynamics, offering new opportunities for ultrafast optoelectronics in Dirac materials.

Title: Two failure modes of deep transformers and how to avoid them: a unified theory of signal propagation at initialisation
Authors: Alessio Giorlandino, Sebastian Goldt
Abstract: Finding the right initialisation for neural networks is crucial to ensure smooth training and good performance. In transformers, the wrong initialisation can lead to one of two failure modes of self-attention layers: rank collapse, where all tokens collapse into similar representations, and entropy collapse, where highly concentrated attention scores lead to training instability. While the right initialisation has been extensively studied in feed-forward networks, an exact description of signal propagation through a full transformer block has so far been lacking. Here, we provide an analytical theory of signal propagation through vanilla transformer blocks with self-attention layers, layer normalisation, skip connections and ReLU MLP. To treat the self-attention layer, we draw on a formal parallel with the Random Energy Model from statistical physics. We identify and characterise two regimes governed by the variance of the query and key initialisations: a low-variance regime, where we recover the known rank collapse behaviour; and a previously unexplored high-variance regime, where signal is preserved but \textit{entropy collapse} occurs. In the low-variance regime, we calculate the critical strength for the residual connection to ensure signal propagation. Our theory yields trainability diagrams that identify the correct choice of initialisation hyper-parameters for a given architecture. Experiments with BERT-style models trained on TinyStories validate our predictions. Our theoretical framework gives a unified perspective on the two failure modes of self-attention and gives quantitative predictions on the scale of both weights and residual connections that guarantees smooth training.

Title: Complex wave functions, CPT and quantum field theory for classical generalized Ising models
Authors: Christof Wetterich
Abstract: The quantum or quantum field theory concept of a complex wave function is useful for understanding the information transport in classical statistical generalized Ising models. We relate complex conjugation to the discrete transformations charge conjugation ($C$), parity ($P$) and time reversal ($T$). A subclass of generalized Ising models are probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) with deterministic updating and probabilistic initial conditions. Two-dimensional PCA correspond to discretized quantum field theories for Majorana--Weyl, Weyl or Dirac fermions. Momentum and energy are conserved statistical observables. For PCA describing free massless fermions we investigate the vacuum and field operators for particle excitations. These automata admit probabilistic boundary conditions that correspond to thermal equilibrium with the quantum Fermi--Dirac distribution. PCA with updating sequences of propagation and interaction steps can realize a rich variety of discrete quantum field theories for fermions with interactions. For information theory the quantum formalism for PCA sheds new light on deterministic computing or signal processing with probabilistic input.

Title: Variation of Bose surface by Filling in Cooper pair Bose metal
Authors: Jiahao Su, Ji Liu, Jianyu Li, Zhangkai Cao, Tao Ying, Ho-Kin Tang
Abstract: The Cooper pair Bose metal (CPBM) is a non-superfluid quantum phase in which uncondensed fermion pairs form a "Bose surface" in momentum space. We investigate the CPBM in the two-dimensional spin-anisotropic attractive Hubbard model by tuning the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping t', carrier filling n, and spin anisotropy alpha, using large-scale constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo simulations. A moderate NNN hopping (t'/t = 0.2) substantially enlarges the CPBM region: the phase extends into weaker anisotropy regimes and coexists with a commensurate charge-density wave (CDW) near half-filling (n > 0.95), where CDW order would otherwise dominate at t' = 0. Interestingly, t' suppresses the overall CDW peak amplitude and introduces a geometric correlation between the orientations of the Fermi and Bose surfaces: for weak Fermi-surface rotations, the Bose surface remains aligned with the lattice axes, while larger distortions drive both surfaces to rotate in tandem. Momentum-resolved pairing distributions reveal that the bosonic pairing channels are jointly controlled by t' and carrier filling n. For small t', d_xy-wave correlations dominate across the entire filling range. In contrast, for larger t', the dominant pairing symmetry varies with n, reflecting a nontrivial interplay between frustration and density. These findings establish carrier filling and NNN hopping as complementary levers for manipulating CPBM stability and provide concrete criteria for identifying non-superfluid bosonic matter in cold-atom and correlated-electron systems.

Title: Disordering a permutation symmetric system: revivals, thermalization and chaos
Authors: Manju C, Uma Divakaran, Arul Lakshminarayan
Abstract: This study explores the effects of introducing a symmetry breaking disorder on the dynamics of a system invariant under particle permutation. The disorder forces quantum states, confined to the $N+1$ dimensional completely symmetric space to penetrate the exponentially large $2^N$ dimensional Hilbert space of $N$ particles. In particular, we focus on the quantum kicked top as a Floquet system of $N$ qubits, and use linear entropy, measuring single qubit entanglement, to investigate the changes in the time scales and values of saturation when disorder is introduced. In the near-integrable regime of the kicked top, we study the robustness of quantum revivals to disorder. We also find that a classical calculation yields the quantum single qubit entanglement to remarkable accuracy in the disorder free limit. The disorder, on the other hand, is modeled in the form of noise which again fits well with the numerical calculations. We measure the extent to which the dynamics is retained within the symmetric subspace and its spreading to the full Hilbert space using different quantities. We show that increasing disorder drives the system to a chaotic phase in full Hilbert space, as also supported by the spectral statistics. We find that there is robustness to disorder in the system, and this is a function of how chaotic the kicked top is.

Title: Three-Dimensional Hieratical Twist in Polar Fluids: Ultra-Low Field-Induced Chirality Regulation
Authors: Hiroya Nishikawa, Dennis Kwaria, Atsuko Nihonyanagi, Fumito Araoka
Abstract: Recently discovered helical polar fluid adopts a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) driven by polarization escape and conformational chirality. Ferroelectric nematic and smectic phases are intrinsically chiral in the ground state and can be stabilized in an extrinsic twisted configuration through surface anchoring. Herein, we introduce extrinsic CSB as a novel technique in chiral engineering. To demonstrate this concept, we constructed the extrinsic structure of a helielectric conical mesophase (HEC)-multi-dimensional chiral system. Considering the challenges of controlling chirality at the macroscopic scale owing to magnetic fields, light, and fluid vortex motion, the proposed multi-dimensional chiral system enables chirality (twist) modulation through an ultralow electric field, thereby controlling unique diffraction pattern and circular polarized light-switching capabilities.

Title: From Pixels to Camera: Scaling Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors for Imaging at the Quantum-Limit
Authors: Jun Gao, Jin Chang, Bruno Lopez Rodriguez, Iman Esmaeil Zadeh, Val Zwiller, Ali W. Elshaari
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as essential devices that push the boundaries of photon detection with unprecedented sensitivity, ultrahigh timing precision, and broad spectral response. Recent advancements in materials engineering, superconducting electronics integration, and cryogenic system design are enabling the evolution of SNSPDs from single-pixel detectors toward scalable arrays and large-format single-photon time tagging cameras. This perspective article surveys the rapidly evolving technological landscape underpinning this transition, focusing on innovative superconducting materials, advanced multiplexed read-out schemes, and emerging cryo-compatible electronics. We highlight how these developments are set to profoundly impact diverse applications, including quantum communication networks, deep-tissue biomedical imaging, single-molecule spectroscopy, remote sensing with unprecedented resolution, and the detection of elusive dark matter signals. By critically discussing both current challenges and promising solutions, we aim to articulate a clear, coherent vision for the next generation of SNSPD-based quantum imaging systems.

Title: Generalization Dynamics of Linear Diffusion Models
Authors: Claudia Merger, Sebastian Goldt
Abstract: Diffusion models trained on finite datasets with $N$ samples from a target distribution exhibit a transition from memorisation, where the model reproduces training examples, to generalisation, where it produces novel samples that reflect the underlying data distribution. Understanding this transition is key to characterising the sample efficiency and reliability of generative models, but our theoretical understanding of this transition is incomplete. Here, we analytically study the memorisation-to-generalisation transition in a simple model using linear denoisers, which allow explicit computation of test errors, sampling distributions, and Kullback-Leibler divergences between samples and target distribution. Using these measures, we predict that this transition occurs roughly when $N \asymp d$, the dimension of the inputs. When $N$ is smaller than the dimension of the inputs $d$, so that only a fraction of relevant directions of variation are present in the training data, we demonstrate how both regularization and early stopping help to prevent overfitting. For $N > d$, we find that the sampling distributions of linear diffusion models approach their optimum (measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence) linearly with $d/N$, independent of the specifics of the data distribution. Our work clarifies how sample complexity governs generalisation in a simple model of diffusion-based generative models and provides insight into the training dynamics of linear denoisers.

Title: Mixed state concurrence for symmetric systems
Authors: S. H. Curnoe, D. Gajera, C. Wei
Abstract: We present a method to quantify entanglement in mixed states of highly symmetric systems. Symmetry constrains interactions between parts and predicts the degeneracies of the states. While symmetry alone produces entangled eigenstates, the thermal mixed state (density) which contains all of the eigenstate densities weighted by their Boltzmann factors is not necessarily as entangled as the eigenstates themselves because generally the mixed state can be re-expressed as a sum over densities which are less entangled. The entanglement of the mixed state is the minimum obtained by considering all such re-expressions, but there is no well-defined approach to solving this problem generally. Our method uses symmetry to explicitly construct unentangled densities, which are then optimally included in the thermal mixed state, resulting in a quantitative measure of entanglement that accounts for the reduction of entanglement arising from degenerate states. We present results for several small spin systems.

Title: Strong coupling of chiral light with chiral matter: a macroscopic study
Authors: Sergey A. Dyakov, Ilia A. Smagin, Natalia S. Salakhova, Oleg Blokhin, Denis G. Baranov, Ilia M. Fradkin, Nikolay A. Gippius
Abstract: Maximizing the interaction between chiral light and chiral matter is pivotal for the advancement of technologies enabling optical detection that distinguishes between different handedness in chiral organic molecules. One strategy involves developing a resonator that sustains photonic modes with non-zero electromagnetic handedness, which interact differently with chiral molecules of opposite enantiomers. When chiral molecules are positioned in resonator hotspots, they can alter the system's characteristics due to their inherent electric and magnetic transition dipole moments. In this study, we explore this interaction by incorporating the Lorentz pole into the macroscopic parameters of the chiral medium: dielectric permittivity, magnetic permeability, and chirality coefficient. The latter, also known as the Pasteur parameter, is a dimensionless macroscopic measure indicating the medium's chirality, interlinking electric and magnetic fields in the constitutive relations. We show that introducing the Lorentz pole into these macroscopic material parameters of the chiral medium results in chiral strong coupling between light and matter, with the strength of coupling determined by both the medium's chirality and the photonic mode's chirality.

Title: Critical demand in a stochastic model of flows in supply networks
Authors: Yannick Feld, Marc Barthelemy
Abstract: Supply networks are essential for modern production, yet their critical properties remain understudied. We present a stochastic model with random production capacities to analyze material flow to a root node, focusing on topology and buffer stocks. The critical demand, where unsatisfied demand diverges, is examined mostly through numerical simulations. Without stocks, minimal production dictates behavior, making topology irrelevant. With stocks, memory effects arise, making topology crucial. Increased local connectivity is beneficial: firms should favor broad, short supply chains over long, narrow ones.

Title: Statistical mechanics of extensive-width Bayesian neural networks near interpolation
Authors: Jean Barbier, Francesco Camilli, Minh-Toan Nguyen, Mauro Pastore, Rudy Skerk
Abstract: For three decades statistical mechanics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. However, the theoretically tractable models, e.g., perceptrons, random features models and kernel machines, or multi-index models and committee machines with few neurons, remained simple compared to those used in applications. In this paper we help reducing the gap between practical networks and their theoretical understanding through a statistical physics analysis of the supervised learning of a two-layer fully connected network with generic weight distribution and activation function, whose hidden layer is large but remains proportional to the inputs dimension. This makes it more realistic than infinitely wide networks where no feature learning occurs, but also more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed inner weights. We focus on the Bayes-optimal learning in the teacher-student scenario, i.e., with a dataset generated by another network with the same architecture. We operate around interpolation, where the number of trainable parameters and of data are comparable and feature learning emerges. Our analysis uncovers a rich phenomenology with various learning transitions as the number of data increases. In particular, the more strongly the features (i.e., hidden neurons of the target) contribute to the observed responses, the less data is needed to learn them. Moreover, when the data is scarce, the model only learns non-linear combinations of the teacher weights, rather than "specialising" by aligning its weights with the teacher's. Specialisation occurs only when enough data becomes available, but it can be hard to find for practical training algorithms, possibly due to statistical-to-computational~gaps.

Title: Quantum Acoustics with Tunable Nonlinearity in the Superstrong Coupling Regime
Authors: Marco Scigliuzzo, Léo Peyruchat, Riccardo Maria Marabini, Carla Becker, Vincent Jouanny, Per Delsing, Pasquale Scarlino
Abstract: Precise control of mechanical modes in the quantum regime is a key resource for quantum technologies, offering promising pathways for quantum sensing with macroscopic systems and scalable architectures for quantum simulation. In this work, we realise a multimode mechanical cavity coupled to a superconducting Kerr resonator, which induces nonlinearity in the mechanical modes. The Kerr mode is realised by a flux-tunable SQUID array resonator, while the mechanical modes are implemented by a surface acoustic wave (SAW) cavity. Both mechanical and electromagnetic modes are individually addressable via dedicated measurement lines, enabling full spectroscopic characterisation. We introduce a straightforward protocol to measure the SQUID array resonator's participation ratio in the hybrid acoustic modes, quantifying the degree of hybridisation. The participation ratio reveals that our device operates at the onset of the multimode coupling regime, where multiple acoustic modes simultaneously interact with the nonlinear superconducting element. Furthermore, this platform allows controllable Kerr-type nonlinearities in multiple acoustic modes, with the participation ratio serving as the key parameter determining both the dissipation rates and nonlinear strengths of these hybridised modes. Close to the resonant regime, we measure a cross-Kerr interaction between seven pairs of mechanical modes, which is controllable via the SQUID array resonator detuning. These results establish a platform for engineering nonlinear multimode mechanical interactions, offering potential for future integration with superconducting qubits and implementation of multiple mechanical qubits.

Title: Possible Unconventional Surface Superconductivity in the Half-Heusler YPtBi
Authors: Eylon Persky, Alan Fang, Xinyang Zhang, Carolina Adamo, Eli Levenson-Falk, Chandra Shekhar, Claudia Felser, Binghai Yan, Aharon Kapitulnik
Abstract: We report an extensive study of the noncentrosymmetric half-Heusler superconductor YPtBi, revealing an unusual relation between bulk superconductivity and the possible appearance of surface superconductivity on the (111) oriented surface, at temperatures up to 3 times the bulk transition temperature. Transport measurements confirmed the low carrier density of the material and its bulk superconducting transition, which was also observed in ac susceptibility through mutual inductance (MI) measurements. However, a weak signature of superconductivity in the MI measurements appeared much above the bulk transition temperature, which was further observed in scanning tunneling spectroscopy, pointing to a possible surface superconducting state. Polar Kerr effect measurements suggest that while the bulk superconductor may exhibit an unusual nodal superconducting state, only the surface state breaks time reversal symmetry. Complementary tunneling measurements on LuPtBi are used to establish the observations on YPtBi, while density-functional theory calculations may shed light on the origin of this unusual surface state.

Title: AC-Stark Spectroscopy of Interactions between Moiré Excitons and Polarons
Authors: B. Evrard, H.S. Adlong, A.A. Ghita, T. Uto, L. Ciorciaro, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, M. Kroner, A. İmamoğlu
Abstract: We use nonlinear pump-probe spectroscopy to study optical excitations in a charge-tunable MoSe$_2$\WS$_2$ moiré heterostructure. An intense red-detuned laser pulse creates a photonic dressing of the material by introducing a large virtual population of excitons or exciton polarons in a deep moiré potential. By measuring the resulting ac Stark effect with a weak resonant laser pulse, we gain access to the nature and mutual interactions of the elementary optical excitations. At charge neutrality, our measurements reveal that different exciton resonances, associated with confinement of their center-of-mass motion in the moiré potential, have a significant spatial overlap. The resulting short-range interactions manifest themselves as a density-dependent blueshift for same-valley excitons and bound biexciton states for opposite-valley excitons. The attractive polaron resonance that appears upon injection of electrons into the heterostructure shows a contrasting behavior: Here, we observe an electron-density-independent light shift and a clear pump-power-dependent saturation. These features are equivalent to that of an ensemble of independent two-level emitters and indicate a breakdown of the Fermi-polaron picture for optical excitations of electrons subject to a strong moiré potential. Our work establishes an experimental approach to elucidate the elementary optical excitations of semiconductor moiré heterostructures, providing a solid ground for the spectroscopy of correlated electronic and excitonic states in such materials.

Title: Local and Global Reciprocity in Orbital-Charge-Coupled Transport
Authors: Dongwook Go, Tom S. Seifert, Tobias Kampfrath, Kazuya Ando, Hyun-Woo Lee, Yuriy Mokrousov
Abstract: The coupled transport of charge and orbital angular momentum (OAM) lies at the core of orbitronics. Here, we examine the reciprocal relation in orbital-charge-coupled transport in thin films, treating bulk and surface contributions on equal footing. We argue that the conventional definition of orbital current is ill-defiled, as it violates reciprocity due to the nonconservation of OAM. This issue is resolved by adopting the so-called \emph{proper} orbital current, which is directly linked to orbital accumulation. We establish the reciprocal relation for the \emph{global} (spatially integrated) response between orbital and charge currents, while showing that their \emph{local} (spatially resolved) responses can differ significantly. In particular, we find large surface contributions that may lead to nonreciprocity when currents are measured locally. These findings are supported by first-principles calculations on W(110) and Pt(111) thin films. In W(110), orbital-charge interconversion is strongly nonreciprocal at the layer level, despite exact reciprocity in the integrated response. Interestingly, spin-charge interconversion in W(110) remains nearly reciprocal even locally. In contrast, Pt(111) exhibits local nonreciprocity for both orbital-charge and spin-charge conversions, which we attribute to strong spin-orbit coupling. We propose that such local distinctions can be exploited to experimentally differentiate spin and orbital currents.

Title: Pulsed Electroluminescence in a Dopant-free Gateable Semiconductor
Authors: S. R. Harrigan, F. Sfigakis, L. Tian, N. Sherlekar, B. Cunard, M. C. Tam, H.-S. Kim, Z. Wasilewski, M. E. Reimer, J. Baugh
Abstract: We report on a stable form of pulsed electroluminescence in a dopant-free direct bandgap semiconductor heterostructure which we coin the tidal effect. Swapping an inducing gate voltage in an ambipolar field effect transistor allows incoming and outgoing carriers of opposite charge to meet and recombine radiatively. We develop a model to explain the carrier dynamics that underpins the frequency response of the pulsed electroluminescence intensity. Higher mobilities enable larger active emission areas than previous reports, as well as stable emission over long timescales.

Title: Superconducting phase interference effect in momentum space
Authors: Bo Zhan, Qiang Gao, Runze Chi, Yiwen Chen, Lin Zhao, Dingshun Lv, Xingjiang Zhou, Tao Xiang
Abstract: Detecting the phases of the superconducting order parameter is pivotal for unraveling the pairing symmetry of superconducting electrons. Conventional methods for probing these phases have focused on macroscopic interference effects, such as the Josephson effect. However, at the microscopic level, phase interference effects within momentum space have remained elusive due to the inherent difficulty of extracting phase information from individual momentum points. By introducing the hybridization effect between a primary band and its replica bands arising from density wave orders or other interactions, we uncover a novel superconducting phase interference effect at the intersection points on the Fermi surfaces of these bands. This effect elucidates the remarkable anomalies recently observed in the single-particle spectral function through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in $Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\delta}$ (Bi2212) superconductors. It can also emerge in twisted junctions of superconductors with coherent tunneling, offering an alternative framework for probing the relative superconducting phase through twisted superstructures.

Title: Noninvertible Gauge Symmetry in (2+1)d Topological Orders: A String-Net Model Realization
Authors: Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for understanding symmetries in topological phases in 2+1 dimensions using the string-net model, encompassing both gauge symmetries that preserve anyon species and global symmetries permuting anyon species, including both invertible symmetries describable by groups and noninvertible symmetries described by categories. As an archetypal example, we reveal the first noninvertible categorical gauge symmetry of topological orders in 2+1 dimensions: the Fibonacci gauge symmetry of the doubled Fibonacci topological order, described by the Fibonacci fusion 2-category. Our approach involves two steps: first, establishing duality between different string-net models with Morita equivalent input fusion categories that describe the same topological order; and second, constructing symmetry transformations within the same string-net model when the dual models have isomorphic input fusion categories, achieved by composing duality maps with isomorphisms of degrees of freedom between the dual models.

Title: Gate-defined Kondo lattices with valley-helical quantum dot arrays
Authors: Antonio L. R. Manesco
Abstract: Kondo physics and heavy-fermion behavior have been predicted and observed in moiré materials. The electric tunability of moiré materials allows an in-situ study of Kondo lattices' phase diagrams, which is not possible with their intermetallic counterparts. However, moiré platforms rely on twisting, which introduces twisting angle disorder and undesired buckling. Here we propose device layouts for one- and two-dimensional gate-defined superlattices in Bernal bilayer graphene where localized states couple to dispersive valley-helical modes. 16We show that, under electronic interactions, these superlattices are described by an electrically-tunable Kondo-Heisenberg model.

Title: Role of Disorder in Third-order Anomalous Hall Effect in Time-reversal Symmetric Systems
Authors: Chanchal K. Barman, Arghya Chattopadhyay, Surajit Sarkar, Jian-Xin Zhu, Snehasish Nandy
Abstract: The third-order anomalous Hall effect (TOAHE) driven by Berry connection polarizability in Dirac materials offers a promising avenue for exploring quantum geometric phenomena. We investigate the role of impurity scattering on TOAHE using the semiclassical Boltzmann framework, via a comparison of the intrinsic contributions (stemming from the Berry connection polarizability) with the extrinsic contributions caused by the disorder. To validate our theoretical findings, we employ a generalized two-dimensional low-energy Dirac model to analytically assess the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the TOAHE. Our analysis reveals distinct disorder-mediated effects, including skew-scattering and side-jump contributions. We also elucidate their intriguing dependencies on Fermi surface anisotropy and discuss opportunities for experimental exploration.

Title: Challenges in the Theory and Atomistic Simulation of Metal Electrodeposition
Authors: Shayantan Chaudhuri, Reinhard J. Maurer
Abstract: Electrodeposition is a fundamental process in electrochemistry, and has applications in numerous industries, such as corrosion protection, decorative finishing, energy storage, catalysis, and electronics. While there is a long history of using electrodeposition, its application for controlled nanostructure growth is limited. The establishment of an atomic-scale understanding of the electrodeposition process and dynamics is crucial to enable the controlled fabrication of metal nanoparticles and other nanostructures. Significant advancements in molecular simulation capabilities and the electronic structure theory of electrified solid-liquid interfaces bring theory closer to realistic applications, but a gap remains between realistic applications, theoretical understanding of dynamics, and atomistic simulation. In this review we briefly summarize the current state-of-the-art computational techniques available for the simulation of electrodeposition and electrochemical growth on surfaces, and identify the remaining open challenges.

Title: Scalable amplitude of Sondheimer oscillations in thin cadmium crystals
Authors: Xiaodong Guo, Xiaokang Li, Lingxiao Zhao, Zengwei Zhu, Kamran Behnia
Abstract: Decades ago, Sondheimer discovered that the electric conductivity of metallic crystals hosting ballistic electrons oscillates with magnetic field. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field with the period proportional to the sample thickness, have been understood in a semi-classical framework. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thickness varying between 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m. When the magnetic field is sufficiently large or the sample sufficiently thick, the amplitude of oscillation falls off as $B^{-4}$ as previously reported. In contrast, the ten first oscillations follow a $B^{-2.5}e^{-B/B_0}$ field dependence and their amplitude is set by the quantum of conductance, the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. This expression is in disagreement with what was predicted in semi-classical scenarios, which neglect Landau quantization. We argue that the classical/quantum crossover occurs at accessible magnetic fields for states whose Fermi wave-vector is almost parallel to the magnetic field. As a consequence, the intersection between the lowest Landau tube and flat toroids on the Fermi surface induced by confinement give rise to oscillations with a periodicity identical to the semi-classical one. A rigorous theoretical account of our data is missing.

Title: Trypanosoma brucei moving in microchannels and through constrictions
Authors: Zihan Tan, Julian I. U. Peters, Holger Stark
Abstract: Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), a single-celled parasite and natural microswimmer, is responsible for fatal sleeping sickness in infected mammals, including humans. Understanding how T. brucei interacts with fluid environments and navigates through confining spaces is crucial not only for medical and clinical applications but also for a fundamental understanding of how life organizes in a confined microscopic world. Using a hybrid multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD)--molecular dynamics (MD) approach, we present our investigations on the locomotion of an in silico T. brucei in three types of fluid environments: bulk fluid, straight cylindrical microchannels, and microchannels with constrictions. We observe that the helical swimming trajectory of the in silico T. brucei becomes rectified in straight cylindrical channels compared to bulk fluid. The swimming speed for different channel widths is governed by the diameter of the helical trajectory. The speed first slightly increases as the channel narrows and then decreases when the helix diameter is compressed. An optimal swimming speed is achieved, when the channel width is approximately twice the bulk helix diameter. It results from an interplay of the trypanosome's hydrodynamic interactions with the cylindrical channel walls and the high deformability of the parasite. In microchannels with constrictions, the motions of the anterior and posterior ends, the end-to-end distance, and the log-rolling motion of the cell body are characterized and show salient differences compared to the straight-channel case. Depending on the constriction length and width, we observe characteristic slip, stuck, and stuck-slip motions of the model T. brucei within the constriction. Our findings may provide some mechanical insights into how T. brucei moves through blood vessels and tissues, and across the blood-brain barrier.

Title: Spin fluctuations steer the electronic behavior in the FeSb$_{3}$ skutterudite
Authors: Enrico Di Lucente, Flaviano José dos Santos, Nicola Marzari
Abstract: Skutterudites are promising materials for thermoelectric and spintronics applications. Here we explore spin fluctuations in the FeSb$_{3}$ skutterudite and their effect on its electronic structure using Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory calculations. We identify multiple magnetic and charge-disproportionated configurations, with an antiferromagnetic metallic ground state. Paramagnetic fluctuations modeled through a special quasirandom spin structure open a 61 meV gap, consistent with experiments. This state features non-degenerate spin channels and band-avoided crossings, resembling a Luttinger-compensated ferrimagnet with topological features. Mapping the electronic structure to a Heisenberg Hamiltonian fails to explain the low Néel temperature ($\lesssim$10 K), suggesting that factors such as stoichiometry and magnetic exchange frustration may play an important role, calling for more detailed experimental investigations.

Title: Quantum Transport with Spin Orbit Coupling: New Developments in TranSIESTA
Authors: Nils Wittemeier, Nick Papior, Mads Brandbyge, Zeila Zanolli, Pablo Ordejón
Abstract: We present the implementation of spinor quantum transport within the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) code TranSIESTA based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). First-principles methods play an essential role in molecular and material modelling, and the DFT+NEGF approach has become a widely-used tool for quantum transport simulation. Exisiting (open source) DFT-based quantum transport codes either model non-equilibrium/finite-bias cases in an approximate way or rely on the collinear spin approximation. Our new implementation closes this gap and enables the TranSIESTA code to use full spinor-wave functions. Thereby it provides a method for transport simulation of topological materials and devices based on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or non-collinear spins. These materials hold enormous potential for the development of ultra-low energy electronics urgently needed for the design of sustainable technology. The new feature is tested for relevant systems determining magnetoresistance in iron nanostructures and transport properties of a lateral transition metal dichalcogenide heterojunction.

Title: Axionic Acoustic Phonons from Weyl Semimetals
Authors: Joan Bernabeu, Alberto Cortijo
Abstract: The sound propagation properties resulting from a dynamical axion insulator generated from a Weyl semimetal are explored. Due to the axial electron-phonon coupling, the speed of sound in the material and its attenuation is seen to be modified. At the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) level, it is seen that the axion obstructs a stronger modification of the speed of sound for longitudinal waves propagating parallel to the Axionic Charge Density Wave (ACDW) wavevector but not for transverse waves. On the other hand, the attenuation is modified by effects beyond the RPA, but the axionic contribution is negligible. These effects can be probed in sound propagation experiments without invoking the axial anomaly, which would require an additional electric field. We also discuss the importance of axial electron-phonon interactions with respect to the more conventional vector interactions in these systems.

Title: Epitaxial growth and transport properties of a metallic altermagnet CrSb on a GaAs (001) substrate
Authors: Seiji Aota, Masaaki Tanaka
Abstract: A newly identified class of magnetic materials called altermagnets has attracted much attention due to the practical properties of spin-splitting bands akin to ferromagnets and small compensated magnetization akin to antiferromagnets. These features make them promising candidates for applications in spintronics devices. Among candidate materials, CrSb is promising because of its high ordering temperature (~705 K) and large spin-splitting energy; however, it is predicted that tuning the Néel vector requires additional symmetry breaking or a change in the easy magnetization axis. While applying epitaxial strain can modulate the symmetry, the selection of substrates with closely matched lattice constants for heteroepitaxial growth is limited for altermagnets, which generally have low crystal symmetry. Therefore, exploring the heteroepitaxial growth of altermagnet thin films on well-established, dissimilar crystal systems is valuable. (001)-oriented III-V semiconductors, which share group-V elements with the overgrown CrSb, offer an ideal platform because they are expected to have material compatibility with stable interfaces, as well as tunability of the buffer layer's bandgap and lattice constant by varying the atomic composition of their group-III and group-V atoms. In this study, we have achieved the molecular beam epitaxial growth of a CrSb ($\bar{1}10$) thin film on a GaAs (001) substrate by inserting thin FeSb ($\bar{1}10$) / AlAs (001) buffer layers. The in-plane epitaxial relationship is found to be CrSb [110] $\|$ GaAs [110] and CrSb [001] $\|$ GaAs [$\bar{1}10$], and epitaxial strain is also confirmed. We also characterized the magneto-transport properties of the grown CrSb thin film. Although the obtained conductivity tensors are mainly explained by a two-carrier model, not by an anomalous Hall effect, this model reveals the presence of high-mobility electron and hole carriers.

Title: Stretching Response of a Polymer Chain with Deformable Bonds
Authors: Jie Zhu, Laurence Brassart
Abstract: The stretching response of polymer chains fundamentally determines the mechanical properties of polymer networks. In this Letter, we develop a statistical mechanics model that incorporates both bond stretching and bond angle deformation, enabling accurate predictions of chain behavior up to large forces. We further propose a semianalytical deformable freely rotating chain (dFRC) model, which represents the chain as a freely rotating chain with effective bond stretch and bond angle that depend on the chain stretch. Using physical parameters without fitting, both the statistical and dFRC models achieve excellent agreement with experimental data for carbon chains across all force regimes. Additionally, the dFRC model provides a direct estimate of the bond force, which is important to predict chain scission. By capturing key bond deformations while remaining computationally efficient, our work lays the foundation for future modeling of polymer network elasticity and failure.

Title: Journey from the Wilson exact RG towards the Wegner-Morris Fokker-Planck RG and the Carosso field-coarsening via Langevin stochastic processes
Authors: Cecile Monthus
Abstract: Within the Wilson RG of 'incomplete integration' as a function of the effective RG-time $t$, the non-linear differential RG-flow for the energy $E_t[\phi(.)]$ translates for the probability distribution $P_t[\phi(.)] \sim e^{- E_t[\phi(.)]} $ into the linear Fokker-Planck RG-flow associated to independent non-identical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes for the Fourier modes. The corresponding Langevin stochastic differential equations for the real-space field $\phi_t(\vec x)$ have been recently interpreted by Carosso as genuine infinitesimal coarsening-transformations that are the analog of spin-blocking, and whose irreversible character is essential to overcome the paradox of the naive description of the Wegner-Morris Continuity-Equation for the RG-flow as a meaningless infinitesimal change of variables in the partition function integral. This interpretation suggests to consider new RG-schemes, in particular the Carosso RG where the Langevin SDE corresponds to the stochastic heat equation also known as the Edwards-Wilkinson dynamics. After a pedestrian self-contained introduction to this stochastic formulation of RG-flows, we focus on the case where the field theory is defined on the large volume $L^d$ with periodic boundary conditions, in order to distinguish between extensive and intensives observables while keeping the translation-invariance. Since the empirical magnetization $m_e \equiv \frac{1}{L^d} \int_{L^d} d^d \vec x \ \phi(\vec x) $ is an intensive variable corresponding to the zero-momentum Fourier coefficient of the field, its probability distribution $p_L(m_e)$ can be obtained from the gradual integration over all the other Fourier coefficients associated to non-vanishing-momenta via an appropriate adaptation of the Carosso stochastic RG, in order to obtain the large deviation properties with respect to the volume $L^d$.

Title: Thermal conductance at the superradiant phase transition in the quantum Rabi model
Authors: Tsuyoshi Yamamoto, Yasuhiro Tokura
Abstract: The quantum Rabi model exhibits a superradiant phase transition when the coupling becomes strong, even though it involves only two components: a two-level atom and a single bosonic mode. This phase transition is referred to as a finite-component quantum phase transition, in contrast to conventional phase transitions in many-body systems. In this Letter, we investigate heat transport across an atom embedded in bosonic modes, modeled by the quantum Rabi model, between two thermal baths. We found a manifestation of the superradiant phase transition in the thermal conductance, which represents the linear response to a temperature bias. Our Letter can be helpful for the development of quantum heat devices utilizing controllable finite-component quantum phase transitions.

Title: Analytic approach to creating homogeneous fields with finite-size magnets
Authors: Ingo Rehberg, Peter Blümler
Abstract: Homogeneous magnetic fields can be generated through the strategic arrangement of permanent magnets. The Halbach array serves as a prominent example of an effective design following this principle. However, it is a two-dimensional approach because it is optimal when placing infinitely long magnets -- line dipoles -- on a circle. If shorter, more realistic magnets are to be used, the optimal arrangement of magnetic moments diverges from the classical Halbach geometry. This paper presents optimal solutions for three-dimensional arrangements calculated for point dipoles, including optimized orientations for single rings and stacks of two rings. They are superior to the original Halbach arrangement and a modification described in the literature, both in terms of the strength and the homogeneity of the magnetic field. Analytic formulae are provided for both cases and tested by experimental realizations.

Title: Kramers nodal lines in intercalated TaS$_2$ superconductors

Hallas, Robert J. Birgeneau, Luis Balicas, Ján Minár, Pavan Hosur, Kam Tuen Law, Emilia Morosan, Ming Yi
Abstract: Kramers degeneracy is one fundamental embodiment of the quantum mechanical nature of particles with half-integer spin under time reversal symmetry. Under the chiral and noncentrosymmetric achiral crystalline symmetries, Kramers degeneracy emerges respectively as topological quasiparticles of Weyl fermions and Kramers nodal lines (KNLs), anchoring the Berry phase-related physics of electrons. However, an experimental demonstration for ideal KNLs well isolated at the Fermi level is lacking. Here, we establish a class of noncentrosymmetric achiral intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide superconductors with large Ising-type spin-orbit coupling, represented by In$_x$TaS$_2$, to host an ideal KNL phase. We provide evidence from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with spin resolution, angle-dependent quantum oscillation measurements, and ab-initio calculations. Our work not only provides a realistic platform for realizing and tuning KNLs in layered materials, but also paves the way for exploring the interplay between KNLs and superconductivity, as well as applications pertaining to spintronics, valleytronics, and nonlinear transport.

Title: Modeling and computation of the effective elastic behavior of parallelogram origami metamaterials
Authors: Hu Xu, Frederic Marazzato, Paul Plucinsky
Abstract: Origami metamaterials made of repeating unit cells of parallelogram panels joined at folds dramatically change their shape through a collective motion of their cells. Here we develop an effective elastic model and numerical method to study the large deformation response of these metamaterials under a broad class of loads. The model builds on an effective plate theory derived in our prior work [64]. The theory captures the overall shape change of all slightly stressed parallelogram origami deformations through nonlinear geometric compatibility constraints that couple the origami's (cell averaged) effective deformation to an auxiliary angle field quantifying its cell-by-cell actuation. It also assigns to each such origami deformation a plate energy associated to these effective fields. Seeking a constitutive model that is faithful to the theory but also practical to simulate, we relax the geometric constraints via corresponding elastic energy penalties; we also simplify the plate energy density to embrace its essential character as a regularization to the geometric penalties. The resulting model for parallelogram origami is a generalized elastic continuum that is nonlinear in the effective deformation gradient and angle field and regularized by high-order gradients thereof. We provide a finite element formulation of this model using the $C^0$ interior penalty method to handle second gradients of deformation, and implement it using the open source computing platform Firedrake. We end by using the model and numerical method to study two canonical parallelogram origami patterns, in Miura and Eggbox origami, under a variety of loading conditions.

Title: Local symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe$_2$
Authors: Zhongzheng Yang, Fanbang Zheng, Dingsong Wu, Bin-Bin Zhang, Ning Li, Wenhui Li, Chaofan Zhang, Guang-Ming Zhang, Xi Chen, Yulin Chen, Shichao Yan
Abstract: The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe$_2$, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortex. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe$_2$ with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction of UTe$_2$ (crystallographic a axis). Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the depth of the superconducting gap and the coherence peak on the one side of the vortex core are stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Considering the distribution of the magnetic field in the vortex, this symmetry breaking is due to the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe$_2$ and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.

Title: Low energy surface phonon dispersion of MoS2
Authors: Aleksandar Radic, Boyao Liu, Akshay Rao, Sam Lambrick
Abstract: The thermal and electronic performance of atomically thin semiconductors, a promising group of materials for electronics, is underpinned by their vibrational (phonon) dynamics. However, surface phonons in layered materials remain poorly understood due to limitations in conventional experimental techniques. We employ helium-3 spin-echo (HeSE) spectroscopy to measure the lowest energy (<10meV) dispersions of surface phonons on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a prototypical 2D semiconductor. We reveal that the widely studied E_2g and A_2u modes possess mixed acoustic-optical character, displaying unexpected quartic and quadratic dispersion relations, and finite-layer confinement to the surface of 4-5 and 6 layers, respectively. Crucially, we find no evidence of any pure acoustic mode at the surface of MoS2. This suppresses anharmonic phonon decay processes, thereby limiting thermal transport and providing a mechanistic explanation for poor thermal conductivity in few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides.

Title: Minimal pole representation for spectral functions
Authors: Lei Zhang, André Erpenbeck, Yang Yu, Emanuel Gull
Abstract: Representing spectral densities, real-frequency, and real-time Green's functions of continuous systems by a small discrete set of complex poles is an ubiquitous problem in condensed matter physics, with applications ranging from quantum transport simulations to the simulation of strongly correlated electron systems. This paper introduces a method for obtaining a compact, approximate representation of these functions, based on their parameterization on the real axis and a given approximate precision. We show applications to typical spectral functions and results for structured and unstructured correlation functions of model systems.

Title: $Σ$-Attention: A Transformer-based operator learning framework for self-energy in strongly correlated systems
Authors: Yuanran Zhu, Peter Rosenberg, Zhen Huang, Hardeep Bassi, Chao Yang, Shiwei Zhang
Abstract: We introduce $\Sigma$-Attention, a Transformer-based operator-learning framework to address a key computational challenge in correlated materials. Our approach utilizes an Encoder-Only Transformer as an ansatz to approximate the self-energy operator of strongly correlated electronic systems. By creating a batched dataset that combines results from three complementary approaches: many-body perturbation theory, strong-coupling expansion, and exact diagonalization, each effective in specific parameter regimes, $\Sigma$-Attention is applied to learn a universal approximation for the self-energy operator that is valid across all regimes. This hybrid strategy leverages the strengths of existing methods while relying on the transformer's ability to generalize beyond individual limitations. More importantly, the scalability of the Transformer architecture allows the learned self-energy to be extended to systems with larger sizes, leading to much improved computational scaling. Using the 1D Hubbard model, we demonstrate that $\Sigma$-Attention can accurately predict the Matsubara Green's function and hence effectively captures the Mott transition at finite temperature. Our framework offers a promising and scalable pathway for studying strongly correlated systems with many possible generalizations.

Title: Classifying destructive quantum interference in molecular junctions: Towards molecular quantum rulers
Authors: Lukas Krieger, Gert-Ludwig Ingold, Fabian Pauly
Abstract: Destructive quantum interference in molecular junctions might be used to build molecular quantum rulers, allowing to quantify changes in external control parameters electrically. For this reason, it is important to understand which patterns of destructive quantum interference can occur inside the electronic excitation gap of a molecule, coupled to conducting electrodes. By considering a four-level model, we show that much more complex destructive quantum interference behavior can arise than expected for just two levels. We classify the destructive quantum interferences analytically and show that they may even occur in regions forbidden by the standard orbital rule for electron transport. Our results suggest that appropriate molecular design may indeed allow to construct highly sensitive molecular quantum rulers.

Title: Magnetic excitations from the hexagonal spin clusters in the S = 1/2 distorted honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet Cu2(pymca)3(ClO4)
Authors: Masaaki Matsuda, Alexander I. Kolesnikov, Zentaro Honda, Tokuro Shimokawa, Sho Inoue, Yasuo Narumi, Masayuki Hagiwara
Abstract: Cu2(pymca)3(ClO4) (pymca: pyrimidine-2-carboxylate) consists of a slightly distorted honeycomb lattice of Cu2+ spins, which shows no long-range magnetic order down to 0.6 K. A magnetization study revealed 1/3 and 2/3 plateau phases [A. Okutani et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 88, 013703 (2019)], which is not expected for regular honeycomb antiferromagnets. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed using a powder sample to investigate the exchange interactions of this material. The spin excitations from the singlet ground state to the first three triplet states, predicted from the antiferromagnetic hexagonal spin cluster interacting with 3.9 meV, were observed. Using the exact diagonalization mothods, the intercluster coupling was estimated from the excitation peak width to be about 20% of the intracluster interaction, which is consistent with the previously reported value. Our exchange path model explains the anisotropic exchange interactions in the distorted honeycomb plane.

Title: Effect of crystallinity on spin-orbit torque in 5$\textit{d}$ iridium oxide IrO$_{2}$
Authors: Tetsuro Morimoto, Kohei Ueda, Junichi Shiogai, Takanori Kida, Masayuki Hagiwara, Jobu Matsuno
Abstract: The 5$\textit{d}$ transition-metal oxides provide an intriguing platform for generating an efficient spin current due to a unique electronic structure dominated by 5d electrons with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report on the effect of crystallinity on current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT) in binary 5$\textit{d}$ iridium oxide IrO$_{2}$ thin films by controlling amorphous, polycrystalline, and epitaxial states. By conducting harmonic Hall measurement in bilayers composed of ferromagnetic Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ and IrO$_{2}$, we find that dampinglike (DL) SOT is larger than fieldlike SOT for all the samples. We also demonstrate that both electrical resistivity and the DL SOT efficiency increase in order of epitaxial, polycrystalline, and amorphous IrO$_{2}$. Despite their different electrical conductivities, spin Hall conductivities of the three states of the IrO$_{2}$ layer are found to be nearly constant, which is consistent with the intrinsic regime of the spin Hall effect scaling relation. Our results highlight the important role that crystallinity plays in the spin-current generation, leading to the potential technological development of spintronic devices based on the 5$\textit{d}$ transition-metal oxides.

Title: Substrate Effect on Electronic Band Structure and Topological Property in Monolayer V2O3 Magnetic Topological Insulator
Authors: Zheng Wang, Jingshen Yan, Shu-Shen Lyu, Kaixuan Chen
Abstract: Monolayer V2O3, a two-dimensional magnetic topological insulator with intrinsic ferromagnetic order and a nontrivial band gap, offers a promising platform for realizing quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the impact of substrate selection on its electronic and topological properties. By modeling heterostructures with van der Waals (vdW) substrates, we demonstrate that non-magnetic substrates such as h-BN preserve the QAH phase with a Chern number C = 1, maintaining gapless chiral edge states. In contrast, ferromagnetic substrates induce extra electrons, destroying the topological order by shifting the Fermi level. These findings establish substrate engineering as a pivotal strategy for experimental realization of dissipationless edge transport in V2O3-based vdW heterostructures, advancing their potential applications as low-power topological electronics.

Title: Fidelity decay and error accumulation in random quantum circuits
Authors: Nadir Samos Sáenz de Buruaga, Rafał Bistroń, Marcin Rudziński, Rodrigo Miguel Chinita Pereira, Karol Życzkowski, Pedro Ribeiro
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of fidelity decay and error accumulation in faulty quantum circuit models. Our work devises an analytical bound for the average fidelity between desired and faulty output states, accounting for errors that may arise during the implementation of two-qubit gates and multi-qubit permutations. It is shown that fidelity decays exponentially with both circuit depth and the number of qubits raised to an architecture-dependent power, and determine the decay rates as a function of the two types of errors. Furthermore, we establish a robust linear relationship between fidelity and the heavy output frequency used in Quantum Volume tests to benchmark quantum processors, under the considered errors protocol. These findings pave the way for predicting the behavior of fidelity in the presence of specific errors and offer insights into the best strategies for increasing Quantum Volume.

Title: Measurement-invisible quantum correlations in scrambling dynamics
Authors: Alan Sherry, Sthitadhi Roy
Abstract: Scrambling unitary dynamics in a quantum system transmutes local quantum information into a non-local web of correlations which manifests itself in a complex spatio-temporal pattern of entanglement. In such a context, we show there can exist three distinct dynamical phases characterised by qualitatively different forms of quantum correlations between two disjoint subsystems of the system. Transitions between these phases are driven by the relative sizes of the subsystems and the degree scrambling that the dynamics effects. Besides a phase which has no quantum correlations as manifested by vanishing entanglement between the parts and a phase which has non-trivial quantum correlations quantified by a finite entanglement monotone, we reveal a new phase transition within the entangled phase which separates phases wherein the quantum correlations are invisible or visible to measurements on one of the subsystems. This is encoded in the qualitatively different properties of the ensemble of states on one of the subsystems conditioned on the various measurement outcomes on the other subsystem. This provides a new characterisation of entanglement phases in terms of their response to measurements instead of the more ubiquitous measurement-induced entanglement transitions. Our results have implications for the kind of tasks that can be performed using measurement feedback within the framework of quantum interactive dynamics.

Title: Precision bounds for multiple currents in open quantum systems
Authors: Saulo V. Moreira, Marco Radaelli, Alessandro Candeloro, Felix C. Binder, Mark T. Mitchison
Abstract: Thermodynamic (TUR) and kinetic (KUR) uncertainty relations are fundamental bounds constraining the fluctuations of current observables in classical, non-equilibrium systems. Several works have verified, however, violations of these classical bounds in open quantum systems, motivating the derivation of new quantum TURs and KURs that account for the role of quantum coherence. Here, we go one step further by deriving multidimensional KUR and TUR for multiple observables in open quantum systems undergoing Markovian dynamics. Our derivation exploits a multi-parameter metrology approach, in which the Fisher information matrix plays a central role. Crucially, our bounds are tighter than previously derived quantum TURs and KURs for single observables, precisely because they incorporate correlations between multiple observables. We also find an intriguing quantum signature of correlations that is captured by the off-diagonal element of the Fisher information matrix, which vanishes for classical stochastic dynamics. By considering two examples, namely a coherently driven qubit system and the three-level maser, we demonstrate that the multidimensional quantum KUR bound can even be saturated when the observables are perfectly correlated.

Title: Trends and Reversion in Financial Markets on Time Scales from Minutes to Decades
Authors: Sara A. Safari, Christof Schmidhuber
Abstract: We empirically analyze the reversion of financial market trends with time horizons ranging from minutes to decades. The analysis covers equities, interest rates, currencies and commodities and combines 14 years of futures tick data, 30 years of daily futures prices, 330 years of monthly asset prices, and yearly financial data since medieval times. Across asset classes, we find that markets are in a trending regime on time scales that range from a few hours to a few years, while they are in a reversion regime on shorter and longer time scales. In the trending regime, weak trends tend to persist, which can be explained by herding behavior of investors. However, in this regime trends tend to revert before they become strong enough to be statistically significant, which can be interpreted as a return of asset prices to their intrinsic value. In the reversion regime, we find the opposite pattern: weak trends tend to revert, while those trends that become statistically significant tend to persist. Our results provide a set of empirical tests of theoretical models of financial markets. We interpret them in the light of a recently proposed lattice gas model, where the lattice represents the social network of traders, the gas molecules represent the shares of financial assets, and efficient markets correspond to the critical point. If this model is accurate, the lattice gas must be near this critical point on time scales from 1 hour to a few days, with a correlation time of a few years.

Title: Passive leakage removal unit based on a disordered transmon array
Authors: Gonzalo Martín-Vázquez, Taneli Tolppanen, Matti Silveri
Abstract: Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.

Title: Antifragility and response to damage in the synchronization of oscillators on networks
Authors: M. A. Polo-González, A. P. Riascos, L. K. Eraso-Hernandez
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a mathematical framework to assess the impact of damage, defined as the reduction of weight in a specific link, on identical oscillator systems governed by the Kuramoto model and coupled through weighted networks. We analyze how weight modifications in a single link affect the system when its global function is to achieve the synchronization of coupled oscillators starting from random initial phases. We introduce different measures that allow the identification of cases where damage enhances synchronization (antifragile response), deteriorates it (fragile response), or has no significant impact. Using numerical solutions of the Kuramoto model, we investigate the effects of damage on network links where antifragility emerges. Our analysis includes lollipop graphs of varying sizes and a comprehensive evaluation and all the edges of 109 non-isomorphic graphs with six nodes. The approach is general and can be applied to study antifragility in other oscillator systems with different coupling mechanisms, offering a pathway for the quantitative exploration of antifragility in diverse complex systems.

Title: A Materials Foundation Model via Hybrid Invariant-Equivariant Architectures
Authors: Keqiang Yan, Montgomery Bohde, Andrii Kryvenko, Ziyu Xiang, Kaiji Zhao, Siya Zhu, Saagar Kolachina, Doğuhan Sarıtürk, Jianwen Xie, Raymundo Arroyave, Xiaoning Qian, Xiaofeng Qian, Shuiwang Ji
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can predict energy, force, and stress of materials and enable a wide range of downstream discovery tasks. A key design choice in MLIPs involves the trade-off between invariant and equivariant architectures. Invariant models offer computational efficiency but may not perform as well, especially when predicting high-order outputs. In contrast, equivariant models can capture high-order symmetries, but are computationally expensive. In this work, we propose HIENet, a hybrid invariant-equivariant materials interatomic potential model that integrates both invariant and equivariant message passing layers, while provably satisfying key physical constraints. HIENet achieves state-of-the-art performance with considerable computational speedups over prior models. Experimental results on both common benchmarks and downstream materials discovery tasks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of HIENet.

Title: Preparing magnonic non-Gaussian states by adding a single magnon onto Gaussian states
Authors: Zi-Xu Lu, Huai-Bing Zhu, Xuan Zuo, Jie Li
Abstract: Quantum magnonics based on YIG spheres provides a new arena for observing macroscopic quantum states. Here we propose to prepare two kinds of non-Gaussian magnonic states by adding a single magnon onto two Gaussian states, namely, coherent and thermal states. We adopt an optomagnonic system of a YIG sphere and use fast optical pulses to weakly activate the magnon-induced Stokes scattering. Conditioned on the detection of a polarized single photon, a single magnon can be added onto an initial Gaussian state. We use a microwave cavity to prepare an initial magnon coherent state and finally read out the generated single-magnon added coherent or thermal state. Both the non-Gaussian states of a magnon mode in a large-size YIG sphere are macroscopic quantum states, which exhibit many nonclassical properties, such as sub-Poissonian statistics, quadrature squeezing, and a negative Wigner function. Further, both states show a smooth transition from a quantum state to a classical state by changing the coherent or thermal magnon excitations and thus can be used for the fundamental study of the quantum-to-classical transition.

Title: Emergence of Hermitian topology from non-Hermitian knots
Authors: Gaurav Hajong, Ranjan Modak, Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning that they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of an NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct topological phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a {\it{first order knot transition}} between different knot structures. Unlike the usual knot transition, this transition is not accompanied by an Exceptional point (EP); in contrast, the real and complex parts of the eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian show a discrete jump at the transition point. We emphasize that the choice of an NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is the same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.

Title: Recurrent Self-Attention Dynamics: An Energy-Agnostic Perspective from Jacobians
Authors: Akiyoshi Tomihari, Ryo Karakida
Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, to investigate more general SA architectures capable of oscillatory dynamics without necessarily admitting an energy function, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the state. We reveal that normalization layers effectively normalize the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, forcing the dynamics close to a critical state. This significantly enhances inference performance. Furthermore, we utilize the Jacobian perspective to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.

Title: Time-tagging data acquisition system for testing superconducting electronics based on an RFSoC and custom analog frontend
Authors: Reed A. Foster, Stephen Kandeh, Owen Medeiros, Alejandro Simon, Matteo Castellani, Karl K. Berggren
Abstract: Novel electronic devices can often be operated in a plethora of ways, which makes testing circuits comprised of them difficult. Often, no single tool can simultaneously analyze the operating margins, maximum speed, and failure modes of a circuit, particularly when the intended behavior of subcomponents of the circuit is not standardized. This work demonstrates a cost-effective data acquisition system for electronic circuits that enables more intricate verification techniques than are practical with conventional experimental setups. We use high-speed digital-to-analog converters and real-time multi-gigasample-per-second waveform processing to push experimental circuits beyond their maximum operating speed. Our custom time-tagging data capture firmware reduces memory requirements and can be used to determine when errors occur. The firmware is combined with a thermal-noise-limited analog frontend with over $50\,\mathrm{dB}$ of dynamic range. Compared to currently available commercial test equipment, this data acquisition system was able to operate a superconducting shift register at a nearly three-times-higher clock frequency ($200\,\mathrm{MHz}$ vs. $80\,\mathrm{MHz}$) at roughly one seventh the cost.

Title: Modified Transfer Matrix Method for the Extraction of Material Properties via Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy
Authors: Kamyar Rashidi, Matthew Y. Sfeir
Abstract: Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy is a powerful technique for extracting the low-frequency optical properties of materials. However, the optical constants are difficult to determine directly from the experimental transfer function, such that various numerical approximations must be implemented to describe specific conditions. Here, we introduce a modified Transfer Matrix Method that uses a genetic algorithm for optimization to determine the refractive index of materials in the THz regime. We show that this approach is generally applicable across a wide range of refractive indices, structures, and frequency ranges. Our method is intuitive and yields accurate results compared to leading methods across a wide spectral range (0.1 - 15 THz).

Title: A theory for diffusion-controlled reactions within nonequilibrium steady states
Authors: Seokjin Moon, David T. Limmer
Abstract: We study diffusion-controlled processes in nonequilibrium steady states, where standard rate theory assumptions break down. Using transition path theory, we generalize the relations between reactive probability fluxes and measures of the rate of the reaction. Stochastic thermodynamics analysis reveals how work constrains the enhancement of rates relative to their equilibrium values. An analytically solvable ion pairing model under a strong electric field illustrates and validates our approach and theory. These findings provide deeper insights into diffusion-controlled reaction dynamics beyond equilibrium.
