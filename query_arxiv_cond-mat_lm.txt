Title: Emergent chiral Higgs mode in $π$-flux frustrated lattices
Authors: Maria Lanaro, Lorenzo Maffi, Marco Di Liberto
Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum simulators provide a powerful platform for realizing strongly correlated phases, enabling access to dynamical signatures of quasiparticles and symmetry breaking processes. Motivated by recent observations of quantum phases in flux-frustrated ladders with non-vanishing ground state currents, we investigate interacting bosons on the dimerized BBH lattice in two dimensions-originally introduced in the context of higher-order topology. After mapping out the phase diagram, which includes vortex superfluid (V-SF), vortex Mott insulator (V-MI), and featureless Mott insulator (MI) phases, we focus on the integer filling case. There, the MI/V-SF transition simultaneously breaks the $\mathbb Z_2^{T}$ and U(1) symmetries, where $\mathbb Z_2^{T}$ corresponds to time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Using a slave-boson description, we resolve the excitation spectrum across the transition and uncover a chiral Higgs mode whose mass softens at criticality, providing a dynamical hallmark of emergent chirality that we numerically probe via quench dynamics. Our results establish an experimentally realistic setting for probing unconventional TRS-broken phases and quasiparticles with intrinsic chirality in strongly interacting quantum matter.

Title: Effect of Niobium Doping on the Crystal Structure and Hydrogen Sorption Properties of TiFe: Combined Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Study
Authors: Abhishek Banerjee, Stefano Deledda, Olena Zavorotynska
Abstract: TiFe alloys are attractive compounds for solid-state stationary hydrogen storage. They can absorb hydrogen gas reversibly at near ambient temperatures and practical pressures with high volumetric capacities surpassing that of cryogenically liquified H2. The main drawback of TiFe-based storage systems is a costly activation procedure required due to the formation of oxide surface layer, which hinders hydrogen diffusion into the bulk. Doping the alloy with various additives is known to improve hydrogen diffusion softening the conditions of the activation procedure. Hydrogen sorption properties of the modified alloys have been the focus of most studies whereas less attention has been dedicated to the fundamental understanding of the effects of hydrogen sorption on the alloys' structure. The latter, however, is an important information in the knowledge-guided design of novel materials. In this work, we investigated effects of Nb-doping on crystallographic structure of TiFe metal-alloy compounds and their hydrogen sorption properties. TiFe samples with two different Nb stoichiometries were synthesized using arc-melting (AM) and characterised with synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXRD) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. Overall, H2 absorption measurements (at 50 +/- 2 degrees C and 40 +/- 2 bar), have shown that doping of TiFe with Nb can improve matrix activation and kinetics of hydrogen sorption without compromising the overall storage capacities. Refinement of SR-PXRD and EXAFS data showed significant Nb occupancy in secondary Ti phases, which improved the hydrogenation properties of the alloys.

Title: Frustrated Magnetism in FeGe$_3$O$_4$ with a Chiral Trillium Network
Authors: Matt Boswell, Mingyu Xu, Haozhe Wang, Mouyang Cheng, N. Li, X. F. Sun, Haidong Zhou, Huibo Cao, Mingda Li, Weiwei Xie
Abstract: The discovery of new magnetic ground states in geometrically frustrated lattices remains a central challenge in materials science. Here, we report the synthesis, structural characterization, and frustrated magnetic properties of FeGe$_3$O$_4$, a newly identified compound that crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric cubic space group $P2_13$. In this structure, Fe atoms form an intricate double-trillium lattice with nearest-neighbor Fe--Fe distances of $\sim$4.2~Å, while Ge$^{2+}$ ions mediate magnetic interactions through Fe-Ge-Fe pathways. Field-dependent magnetization at 2~K shows a pronounced nonlinearity, reaching a maximum moment of 2.55(3)~$\mu_\mathrm{B}$/Fe$^{2+}$ at 70~kOe without evidence of saturation. Magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and neutron scattering collectively reveal the onset of short-range magnetic interactions near 5~K, with no long-range ordering detected down to 0.06~K. Specific heat measurements demonstrate strong frustration: only $\sim$34\% of the expected magnetic entropy is recovered at 2.4~K. Taken together, these results establish FeGe$_3$O$_4$ as a rare example of a geometrically frustrated trillium-lattice magnet, offering a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum magnetic phenomena.

Title: Elasticity without a reference state: continuum mechanics of active tension nets
Authors: Nikolas H. Claussen, Fridtjof Brauns, Boris I. Shraiman
Abstract: A constitutive relation between stress and strain relative to a reference state is the basic assumption of elasticity theory. However, in living matter, stress is governed by (motor molecule) activity rather than a constitutive law. What paradigm takes the place of elasticity in this setting? Here, we derive a continuum theory of active mechanics by taking the continuum limit of the Active Tension Network model of 2d epithelia. Instead of a reference state, we start from a prescribed active force configuration, encoded in a Riemannian "tension metric". Intuitively, one expects cells to adjust their positions to achieve force balance by rearranging local sources of active stress. More precisely, the cell positions define an embedding of the tension metric into 2d physical space, which determines the macroscopic physical stress. For free boundaries, tissue adopts a certain intrinsically defined shape, the force-balanced embedding with minimal internal stress. Boundary forces then deform this embedding. The resulting stress transformation yields an effective stress-strain relation. Key elements of elasticity hence emerge from a "stress-only" starting point, explaining how tissue shape can be adiabatically controlled by active stress during morphogenesis. Plastic behavior arises from topological cell rearrangement, which we represent by a continuous reparameterization of the tension metric, providing a principled continuum theory of emergent elasto-plastic flow. To express this physics, we use the mathematics of isothermal coordinates and quasi-conformal maps. The present theory elucidates the unconventional mechanics of living tissues and may apply to 2d active and granular materials more generally.

Title: Machine Learning-Driven Creep Law Discovery Across Alloy Compositional Space
Authors: Hongshun Chen, Ryan Zhou, Rujing Zha, Zihan Chen, Wenpan Li, Rowan Rolark, John Patrick Reidy, Jian Cao, Ping Guo, David C. Dunand, Horacio D. Espinosa
Abstract: Hihg-temperature creep characterization of structural alloys traditionally relies on serial uniaxial tests, which are highly inefficient for exploring the large search space of alloy compositions and for material discovery. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-assisted, high-throughput framework for creep law identification based on a dimple array bulge instrument (DABI) configuration, which enables parallel creep testing of 25 dimples, each fabricated from a different alloy, in a single experiment. Full-field surface displacements of dimples undergoing time-dependent creep-induced bulging under inert gas pressure are measured by 3D digital image correlation. We train a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a surrogate model, mapping creep parameters and loading conditions to the time-dependent deformation response of DABI. Coupling this surrogate with a particle swarm optimization scheme enables rapid and global inverse identification with sparsity regularization of creep parameters from experiment displacement-time histories. In addition, we propose a phenomenological creep law with a time-dependent stress exponent that captures the sigmoidal primary creep observed in wrought INCONEL 625 and extracts its temperature dependence from DABI test at multiple temperatures. Furthermore, we employ a general creep law combining several conventional forms together with regularized inversion to identify the creep laws for 47 additional Fe-, Ni-, and Co-rich alloys and to automatically select the dominant functional form for each alloy. This workflow combined with DABI experiment provides a quantitative, high-throughput creep characterization platform that is compatible with data mining, composition-property modeling, and nonlinear structural optimization with creep behavior across a large alloy design space.

Title: Charge Transport and Multiplication in Lateral Amorphous Selenium Devices Under Cryogenic Conditions
Authors: M. Rooks, S. Abbaszadeh, J. Asaadi, V. A. Chirayath, M. Á. García-Peris, E. Gramellini, K. Hellier, B. Sudarsan, I. Tzoka
Abstract: Cryogenic photon sensing for high-energy physics motivates photosensor technologies that combine large-area scalability with internal gain and stable operation at low temperature. Amorphous selenium is a promising photoconductor, yet its field- and temperature-dependent transport and avalanche response in lateral geometries have not been systematically established. This work reports field-resolved photocurrent measurements of lateral a-Se devices from 93 K to 297 K under 401 nm excitation at fields up to 120 V/um. Below avalanche onset, the external quantum efficiency was described by the Onsager model, yielding effective post-thermalization separations that decrease with decreasing temperature. The field-assisted detrapping region was evaluated using several transport models, with the data favoring field-assisted hopping and thermally-assisted tunneling as the mechanisms that best capture the temperature evolution of the photocurrent. The boundaries between field-assisted detrapping, transport-limited conduction, and avalanche shift with temperature; at 93 K the response transitions directly from detrapping into avalanche. Avalanche multiplication was analyzed using the Lucky-drift model. These results provide the first systematic characterization of cryogenic avalanche behavior in lateral a-Se detectors and establish quantitative trends relevant to low-temperature, high-gain photodetector design.

Title: Quantifying the Relationship Between Strain and Bandgap in Thin Ga$_2$Se$_2$
Authors: Lottie L. Murray, Eric Herrmann, Igor Evangelista, Anderson Janotti, Xi Wang, Matthew F. Doty
Abstract: We present a rigorous analysis that combines theory, simulation, and experimental measurements to quantify the relationship between strain and bandgap in two dimensional gallium selenide (Ga$_2$Se$_2$). Experimentally, we transfer thin Ga$_2$Se$_2$ flakes onto patterned substrates to deterministically induce multiaxial localized strain. We quantify the local strain using a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements and COMSOL Multiphysics simulation. We then experimentally map the strain-induced bandgap shifts using high-resolution hyperspectral PL imaging to generate a robust and statistically significant dataset. We systematically fit this data to extract gauge factors that relate the bandgap shift to the local uniaxial and biaxial strain. We then compute the uniaxial and biaxial strain gauge factors via density functional theory (DFT) and find excellent agreement with the experimentally-determined values. Finally, we show that a simple model that computes bandgap shifts from the local uniaxial and biaxial strain predicts the observed multiaxial bandgap shift with less than 10\% error. The combined results provide a framework for deterministic realization of tailored bandgap profiles induced by controlled strain applied to Ga$_2$Se$_2$, with implications for the future realization of localized quantum emitters for quantum photonic applications.

Title: Two-Dimensional Twisted Ferromagnetic Domain Wall as a Spin-Wave Diffraction Grating
Authors: Ehsan Faridi, Se Kwon Kim, Giovanni Vignale
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of spin-wave scattering by a twisted domain wall (DW) in a two-dimensional ferromagnet with easy-axis anisotropy. While the twisted DW generates an effective gauge field for spin waves, leading to a deflection of their trajectories, our main focus is on a distinct effect that arises when a hard-axis anisotropy is present in addition to the easy-axis anisotropy. In this case, the translational symmetry of the spin-wave Hamiltonian along the DW is broken, resulting in a periodic modulation of the Hamiltonian. This periodicity leads to the formation of multiple diffracted spin wave modes on both sides of the DW, engendering a DW-induced magnonic diffraction pattern. The interplay between the emergent gauge field and the anisotropy-induced periodicity reveals rich spin-wave dynamics and suggests potential applications for manipulating magnon flow in two-dimensional magnetic textures.

Title: Electronic layer decoupling driven by density-wave order in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$
Authors: Ziqiang Guan, Sophia F. R. TenHuisen, M. Tepie, Yifeng Zhao, Ezra Day-Roberts, Harrison LaBollita, Alexander M. Young, Xiaomeng Cui, Xinglong Chen, Filippo Glerean, Carl A. Guia, Mark P. M. Dean, Philip Kim, J. F. Mitchell, Antia S. Botana, Christopher C. Homes, Matteo Mitrano
Abstract: We probe the density-wave transition of the trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ with polarization-resolved infrared spectroscopy. The low-energy electrodynamics is strongly anisotropic, with metallic in-plane and insulating out-of-plane character. In the ordered phase, the anisotropy grows more than an order of magnitude as the out-of-plane conductivity is sharply suppressed. We interpret this enhancement as an effective electronic decoupling of the Ni-O layers, driven by a spin-density-wave-induced redistribution of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ occupation within the trilayers. This electronic response is accompanied by clear shifts and splittings of the out-of-plane phonons, compatible with a density-wave instability of electronic origin.

Title: Divergent Fluctuations from an Infrared 2D-Mode Catastrophe
Authors: Richard G. Hennig, Clotilde S. Cucinotta
Abstract: Molecular simulations of interfacial polar media routinely employ periodic boundary conditions parallel to the interface. We show that this geometry injects a uniform plane mode ($q_{\parallel}=0$) that converts the plane-averaged electrostatic potential into a cumulative sum of plane-dipole increments, a random walk in $z$. Consequently, the variance of the plane-averaged potential grows linearly with depth in semi-infinite slabs and follows a parabolic Brownian-bridge profile in finite cells with both ends fixed, with an amplitude inversely proportional to the cell's lateral area. Hence, at any finite area, the variance diverges with slab thickness, a 2D-mode catastrophe. In contrast, a pure 1D chain (no lateral replication) and a fully 3D, nonperiodic medium both exhibit bounded fluctuations that saturate with distance. The mechanism is generic to any solver of Poisson's equation with 2D periodicity, so the apparent growth and ultimate divergence in potential fluctuation are artifacts of boundary conditions rather than material response, and we provide a simple scaling criterion for choosing slab sizes that keeps these artifacts under quantitative control.

Title: Strain-Driven "Sinusoidal" Valley Control of Hybridized $Γ-\mathrm{K}$ Excitons
Authors: Yingtong Zhu, Kang Lan, Shiling Li, Ning Hao, Ping Zhang, Jiyong Fu
Abstract: The photoluminescence (PL) of momentum-indirect $\rm \Gamma- K$ excitons in monolayer WS$_2$ under biaxial strain was recently observed by Blundo et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 067402 (2022)], yet its microscopic origin remains elusive. Here we develop a unified framework that reproduces the measured PL and reveals its fundamental excitonic mechanism. We reveal that: (i) the PL originates from genuinely hybridized direct-indirect excitonic eigenstates, rather than nominally mixed species with fixed dominant character; (ii) the direct exciton converts into the indirect one via a previously unrecognized two-step pathway -- exchange-interaction-driven exciton transfer followed by a spin flip; and (iii) a higher-energy indirect exciton, absent from prior studies, acts as a crucial intermediate mediating this conversion. Beyond explaining experiment, our theory predicts a striking strain-driven "sinusoidal'' valley response, furnishing a continuously tunable valley dial that far exceeds binary control schemes. This unified picture of strain-engineered direct-indirect exciton dynamics introduces a new paradigm for manipulating long-lived valley degrees of freedom, opening a pathway toward programmable valley pseudospin engineering and next-generation valleytronic quantum technologies.

Title: Coexistence of long-range magnetic order and dynamical magnetism in the V-based Kagome metals: A combined thermodynamic and $μ$SR study
Authors: Sheetal Devi, Yishui Zhou, Thomas J. Hicken, Zurab Guguchia, Hubertus Luetkens, Min-Kai Lee, Lieh-Jeng Chang, Yixi Su
Abstract: V-based Kagome metals exhibit a unique lattice geometry that can give rise to exotic electronic and magnetic phenomena, making them an ideal platform to study the interplay of topology and magnetism. We present a combined thermodynamic and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) investigation of single-crystal RV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) compounds, focusing on their low-temperature magnetic behavior. Heat capacity and $\mu$SR measurements reveal distinct magnetic phase transitions below 4 K, confirming the emergence of long-range magnetic order in all compounds studied. The $\mu$SR results further indicate persistent spin fluctuations within the magnetically ordered state down to 50 mK, reflected in reduced ordered moments obtained from hyperfine analysis of the heat capacity measurements. These findings uncover the coexistence of static and dynamic magnetism in V-based Kagome metals and emphasizing the key role of 4$f$-electron anisotropy in shaping their magnetic ground states. Compared with the Mn-based RMn$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ analogs, our results highlight the unique magnetism arising from the decoupled rare-earth sublattice and its interplay with the nonmagnetic V Kagome network.

Title: Boson peak as a phenomenon participated by the vast majority of particles
Authors: Cunyuan Jiang
Abstract: The origin of the excess vibrational density of states (DOS) beyond Debye's theory in amorphous solids (often referred to as the Boson peak) has been attributed to the presence of quasi-localized vibrational modes in recent years. However, by dispersing the total DOS onto each degree of freedom (DOF), the results of this report provide evidence that \(99.9\%\) of DOFs, and hence almost all particles, contribute to the Boson peak (BP). These results challenge the prevailing opinion that BP is contributed by a minority of particles and highlight its long-neglected global and collective origin.

Title: Electronic procrystalline state in moire structures

Abstract: Solid state materials can display varieties of atomic structural orders ranging from crystalline to amorphous, underlying their properties and diverse functionalities. Procrystal has emerged as a new category of solids, featuring a long-range ordered lattice framework tiled with disordered atomic or molecular structures on the lattice sites, arousing great interest due to its novel structural and physical properties. However, the electronic analogue of a procrystal, dubbed as an electronic procrystalline (EPC) state, has never been experimentally observed. Here, we report the observation of an EPC state in a moire superstructure formed between a monolayer metallic NiTe2 and a superconductor NbSe2 with incommensurate lattice wavevectors. The observed EPC state exhibits a long-range periodic charge modulation at the moire scale inlaid with short-range irregular orders within each moire cell. Strikingly, the short-range charge orders inside the moire unit cells have proximately root3*root3 quasi-period, which is absent in pristine NiTe2. Intriguingly, the EPC order is also observed in the superconducting state of the moire superstructure. Furthermore, the emergent EPC state and short-range charge order, coexisting with the proximity induced superconductivity, can be precisely modulated with the thickness of NiTe2. Our findings uncover the potential of moire platform for understanding and tuning novel correlated quantum phases with this exotic procrystalline order.

Title: Unexpected type-II multiferroic phase in GdMnO3 under high magnetic fields
Authors: Ming Yang, Jun Chen, Junfeng Wang, Chao Dong, Chengliang Lu, Gang Xu, Jinguang Cheng, Jianshi Zhou, Shuai Dong
Abstract: Perovskite manganites with small A-site ions, as the first and canonical branch of type-II multiferroics, are ideal systems to exhibit magnetism-induced ferroelectricity. Despite their established magnetoelectric phase diagrams under low magnetic fields, here an unidentified phase with a large magnetism-induced polarization (up to 1500 {\mu}C/m2) is revealed in GdMnO3 under high magnetic fields up to 60 T. Based on multiprobe experiments, a complete phase diagram is constructed with successive polar-nonpolar-polar-nonpolar transitions. Such a nonmonotonic evolution is well mimicked by model simulation, while the spin-lattice coupling is the key ingredient for the reentrant ferroelectric phase.

Title: Data-Driven Exploration and Insights into Temperature-Dependent Phonons in Inorganic Materials
Authors: Huiju Lee, Zhi Li, Jiangang he, Yi Xia
Abstract: Phonons, quantized vibrations of the atomic lattice, are fundamental to understanding thermal transport, structural stability, and phase behavior in crystalline solids. Despite advances in computational materials science, most predictions of vibrational properties in large materials databases rely on the harmonic approximation and overlook crucial temperature-dependent anharmonic effects. Here, we present a scalable computational framework that combines machine learning interatomic potentials, anharmonic lattice dynamics, and high-throughput calculations to investigate temperature-dependent phonons across thousands of materials. By fine-tuning the universal M3GNet interatomic potential using high-quality phonon data, we improve phonon prediction accuracy by a factor of four while preserving computational efficiency. Integrating this refined model into a high-throughput implementation of the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, we compute temperature-dependent phonons for 4,669 inorganic compounds. Our analysis identifies systematic elemental and structural trends governing anharmonic phonon renormalization, with particularly strong manifestations in alkali metals, perovskite-derived frameworks, and related systems. Machine learning models trained on this dataset identify key atomic-scale features driving strong anharmonicity, including weak bonding, large atomic radii, and specific coordination motifs. First-principles validation confirms that anharmonic effects can dramatically alter lattice thermal conductivity by factors of two to four in some materials. This work establishes a robust and efficient data-driven approach for predicting finite-temperature phonon behavior, offering new pathways for the design and discovery of materials with tailored thermal and vibrational properties.

Title: Vanishing Phase Stiffness and Fluctuation-Dominated Superconductivity: Evidence for Inter-Band Pairing in UTe$_2$
Authors: Sahas Kamat, Jared Dans, Shanta Saha, Daniel F. Agterberg, Johnpierre Paglione, B. J. Ramshaw
Abstract: Superconductivity in three dimensions is almost universally governed by Ginzburg-Landau mean field theory, with critical fluctuations typically confined to within a few percent of the transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$). We report that the heavy-Fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ exhibits a fluctuation regime that extends over a temperature range as wide as $T_{\rm c}$ itself -- the largest observed for any three-dimensional superconductor. Through ultrasound measurements of the elastic moduli and sound attenuation, we find that UTe$_2$ transitions from a mean-field-like state at ambient pressure to a fluctuation dominated state at higher pressures. This regime is marked by elastic softening and an increase in sound attenuation that onsets well above $T_{\rm c}$, with the attenuation remaining anomalously high deep in the superconducting state. Our analysis shows that these features stem from an extremely low superfluid phase stiffness. This results in a kinetic inductance as high as that of granular aluminum, but achieved in the clean limit. We propose that this exotic state is driven by dominant inter-band pairing mediated by ferromagnetic fluctuations, leading to "local" cooper pairs with a coherence length of only a few lattice constants.

Title: Multiple three-magnon splittings in bismuth yttrium iron garnet nanostructures
Authors: Sali Salama, Joo-Von Kim, Maryam Massouras, Jamal Ben Youssef, Abdelmadjid Anane, Jean-Paul Adam
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the generation of multiple three-magnon splitting processes in an in-plane magnetized submicron Bi-YIG disk using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering. The low magnetic damping and strong magneto-optical response of BiYIG enable the detection of nonlinear spin-wave interactions at low threshold powers. By tuning the in-plane static magnetic field, excitation frequency, and power, we observe the generation of three pairs of secondary modes symmetrically distributed around half the excitation frequency. Time-resolved BLS measurements present temporal dynamics and threshold behavior associated with the successive activation of three-magnon pairs.

Title: Active alignment-driven coarsening in confined near-critical fluids
Authors: Parameshwaran A, Bhaskar Sen Gupta
Abstract: We investigate vapor-liquid phase separation of an active near critical Lennard-Jones fluid confined within a cylindrical pore using molecular dynamics simulations. Activity is introduced via Vicsek-type alignment interactions, enabling a systematic study of how self-propulsion modifies domain morphology and coarsening kinetics under quasi-one-dimensional confinement. In the passive limit, the system undergoes early-time spinodal decomposition (diffusive growth characterized by the Lifshitz-Slyozov exponent $\alpha = 1/3$), followed by the formation of periodically modulated, plug-like liquid domains along the pore axis. At late times, coarsening becomes kinetically arrested, and the system remains trapped in a metastable striped state. Introducing activity destabilizes this arrested morphology by enhancing collective domain transport, leading to frequent domain mergers and complete phase separation at sufficiently high activity. The late-stage coarsening then exhibits a crossover to faster, ballistic growth with an effective exponent $\alpha = 2/3$, consistent with a cluster-coalescence mechanism. Analysis of two-point correlation functions and structure factors confirms dynamic scaling across all activity regimes. Our results demonstrate that alignment-induced activity can overcome confinement-driven kinetic arrest, providing new insight into phase separation in confined active fluids. The relevant growth laws are analyzed and interpreted using appropriate theoretical frameworks.

Title: Entropic Colloidal Crystal Prediction: A Quantum Density Functional Theory Inspired Approach
Authors: Kristi Pepa, Isaac R. Spivack, Trevor F.G. Teague, Ryn Y. Oliphant, Domagoj Fijan, Sharon C. Glotzer
Abstract: In pursuit of a colloidal analogue to quantum density functional theory (DFT) predictions of atomic crystal structures, we report a new, classical DFT that predicts the relative thermodynamic stability of colloidal crystals of hard, convex particle shapes. In contrast to standard classical DFT approaches, our theory maps the hard particle system to an auxiliary system in which we treat the particles as fixed "nuclei" embedded in a fictitious, spatially varying density field that distributes throughout the auxiliary system. By minimizing the free energy of the auxiliary system, and through comparison with known equations of state and free energy calculations using thermodynamic integration, we show that the auxiliary system with the lowest free energy corresponds to the most probable crystal of hard shapes in the original system.

Title: Magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements under bipolar pulsed magnetic fields
Authors: Soichiro Yamane, Sota Nakamura, Atsutoshi Ikeda, Kosuke Noda, Akihiko Ikeda, Shingo Yonezawa
Abstract: The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is a powerful probe of magnetism. Its contact-free optical nature makes it potentially well suitable for measurements under pulsed magnetic fields if various difficulties are overcome. In this paper, we report the establishment of MOKE measurements under bipolar pulsed magnetic fields up to 13.1 T. The accuracy of the setup was demonstrated by the excellent agreement with static-field results on the (001) surface of a Fe3O4 single crystal. Furthermore, clear hysteresis loops of various commercial permanent magnets were successfully observed. The capability for rapid characterization of hysteretic properties highlights the versatility of our pulsed-field MOKE setup for both fundamental materials science and engineering applications.

Title: Gap solitons of the Wannier and Bloch types in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with a moiré lattice
Authors: Jun-Tao He, Xue-Ping Cheng, Xin-Wei Jin, Hui-Jun Li, Ji Lin, Boris A. Malomed
Abstract: Gap solitons (GSs) bifurcating from flat bands, which may be represented in terms of Wannier functions, have garnered significant interest due to their strong localization with extremely small norms. Moiré lattices (MLs), with multiple flat bands, offer an appropriate platform for creating such solitons. We explore the formation mechanism and stability of GSs in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the combined action of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and an ML potential. We identify five Wannier-type GS families bifurcating from the lowest five energy bands in the spectrum induced by the ML with sufficiently large period and depth. These fundamental GSs serve as basic elements for constructing more complex Wannier-type GS states. Reducing the lattice period and depth triggers a transition from the Wannier-type GSs to ones of the Bloch type, the latter exhibiting higher norm thresholds and pronounced spatial broadening near edges of the energy bands. In addition to tuning the lattice-potential parameters, adjusting the SOC strength can also modulate the flatness of energy bands and enhance the localization of gap solitons, enabling reversible transitions between the GSs of the Wannier and Bloch types. Distinctive properties of GSs in the quasiperiodic ML are uncovered too. Thus, we propose the theoretical foundation for the creation of and manipulations with strongly localized GSs.

Title: Evolution from three-dimensional charge density wave to one-dimensional stripe order in CsV$_{3-x}$Ti$_x$Sb$_5$
Authors: Qian Xiao, Xiangqi Liu, Zihao Huang, Xiquan Zheng, Shilong Zhang, Hui Chen, Hong-Jun Gao, Yanfeng Guo, Yingying Peng
Abstract: Understanding intertwined phases near quantum criticality is a central challenge in correlated electron systems. The kagome metal CsV$_{3-x}$Ti$_x$Sb$_5$ provides a fertile platform to investigate the interplay between charge-density-wave (CDW) and superconductivity. Here, combining x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we uncover a dimensional evolution of the CDW upon Ti substitution. We find that even infinitesimal Ti doping (x = 0.009) completely suppresses the three-dimensional 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 4 CDW present in pristine CsV3Sb5, while reducing the remaining 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 CDW to a quasi-two-dimensional order. With further Ti substitution, although no CDW transition is discernible in resistivity measurements, our XRD and STM data reveal the emergence of a (quasi-)one-dimensional CDW with a short correlation length of $\sim$ 20 $Å$ at x = 0.2. The stripelike CDW undergoes a continuous second-order phase transition, characterized by a gradual increase in intensity and correlation length below $\sim$ 56 K. Our results elucidate the dimensional evolution of CDW order in CsV$_{3-x}$Ti$_x$Sb$_5$ and provide new insight into understanding the unconventional CDWs and their role in kagome superconductors.

Title: Multiple-$Q$ spin textures induced by spiral--staggered interference in one-dimensional itinerant magnets
Authors: Satoru Hayami, Kazuki Okigami
Abstract: We theoretically investigate multiple-$Q$ magnetic states emerging from the interference between finite-$Q$ spiral and staggered spin modulations in a one-dimensional itinerant electron system. The multiple-$Q$ spin textures are characterized by a superposition of symmetry-unrelated ordering wave vectors in the same direction with distinct periodicities rather than rotationally symmetry-related ones. Motivated by recent experimental observations of broken helix magnetic structures in EuIn$_2$As$_2$, we focus on the microscopic interaction conditions in stabilizing such multiple-$Q$ this http URL employ two effective spin models: One is the momentum-space-based model, and the other is the real-space-based model, both of which include bilinear and biquadratic easy-plane anisotropic interactions. By analyzing their ground state via simulated annealing, we find that a superposition of a spiral and a staggered modulation yields a robust double-$Q$ magnetic structure. Moreover, we demonstrate that the obtained double-$Q$ spin configuration exhibits an antisymmetric spin-split band structure even without the relativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and further reveals asymmetric band modulations when the magnetic field is applied along the out-of-plane direction. Our results provide a theoretical framework for understanding unconventional multiple-$Q$ magnetic textures in one-dimensional systems.

Title: One-Dimensional Frenkel and Wannier Excitons in Electric Fields: Stark Effect, Ionization, Polarizability and Electroabsorption
Authors: Thomas Garm Pedersen
Abstract: One-dimensional semiconductors are characterized by strongly bound excitons. Therefore, the Frenkel regime of excitons localized within a few unit cells is readily reached and traditional Wannier exciton models become inadequate. In the presence of strong electric fields, excitons are polarized and, in extreme cases, ionized. Such strong-field effects have previously been described analytically for Wannier excitons. In the present work, we show that analytical results can be extended to the more involved Frenkel case as well. Hence, by analytically solving the difference equation describing Frenkel excitons in electric fields, we derive close-form expressions for resonances providing Stark shifts and ionization rates. Moreover, closed-form results for exciton electroabsorption spectra and dynamic polarizability are obtained.

Title: Representative-volume sizing in finite cylindrical computed tomography by low-wavenumber spectral convergence

Abstract: Choosing a representative element volume (REV) from finite cylindrical $\mu$CT scans becomes ambiguous when a key field variable exhibits a slow axial trend, because estimated statistics can change systematically with subvolume size and position rather than converging under simple averaging. A practical workflow is presented to size an REV under such nonstationary conditions by first suppressing axial drift/trend to obtain a residual field suitable for second-order analysis, and then selecting the smallest analysis diameter for which low-wavenumber content stabilizes within a prescribed tolerance. The approach is demonstrated on \textit{Thalassinoides}-bearing rocks, whose branching, connected burrow networks impose heterogeneity on length scales comparable to typical laboratory core diameters, making imaging-based microstructural statistics and downstream digital-rock proxies highly sensitive to the chosen subvolume. From segmented data, a scalar ``burrowsity'' field--capturing burrow-related pore spaces and infills--is defined, and axial detrending (with optional normalization) is applied to mitigate acquisition drift and nonstationary trends. Representativeness is then posed as a diameter-convergence problem on nested inscribed cylinders: the two-point covariance and its isotropic spectral counterpart $\widehat{C}$ are estimated, and the smallest diameter at which the low-wavenumber plateau becomes stable is selected. Applied to a segmented \textit{Thalassinoides} core, the method identifies a minimum analysis cylinder of approximately $D_{\mathrm{REV}}\approx 93~\mathrm{mm}$ and $H_{\mathrm{REV}}\approx 83~\mathrm{mm}$, enabling reproducible correlation-scale reporting and connectivity-sensitive property estimation.

Title: Tunnel-Barrier-Engineered Ultrafast Demagnetization and Spin Transport in Graphene-Based Heterostructures
Authors: Suchetana Mukhopadhyay, David Muradas-Belinchon, Francesco Foggetti, Peter M. Oppeneer, M. Venkata Kamalakar, Anjan Barman
Abstract: Heterostructures combining graphene with 3d transition metal ferromagnets (FMs) enable various spin-based phenomena at ultrafast timescales. However, challenges such as the interfacial impedance mismatch, FM deposition-induced defect generation, and interface modification by interfacial coupling or hybridization can impede their functionalization for spin-orbitronics. In this work, we utilize insulating TiOx barrier layers (BLs) to modify the interfacial spin conductance structurally, disentangle spin pumping and magnetic proximity effects (MPE), and establish external control over ultrafast magnetization dynamics in single-layer graphene/TiOx/Co systems. All-optical time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements of femtosecond to nanosecond spin dynamics reveal systematic tunability of ultrafast magnetic parameters via barrier engineering. The thickness-dependent damping modulation in Co indicates strong spin pumping, with interfacial spin transparency close to half its physical limit in the presence of an ultrathin BL, where MPE is eliminated. Our results show that appropriately chosen ultrathin BLs can prevent interfacial alterations from ferromagnetic metals, facilitating efficient spin detection in graphene and enhancing control over spin angular momentum dissipation in graphene/FM interfaces.

Title: A first passage problem for a Poisson counting process with a linear moving boundary
Authors: Ivan Burenev, Michael J. Kearney, Satya N. Majumdar
Abstract: The time to first crossing for the Poisson counting process with respect to a linear moving barrier with offset is a classic problem, although key results remain scattered across the literature and their equivalence is often unclear. Here we present a unified and pedagogical treatment of two approaches: the direct time-domain approach based on path-decomposition techniques and the Laplace-domain approach based on the Pollaczek-Spitzer formula. Beyond streamlining existing derivations and establishing their consistency, we leverage the complementary nature of the two methods to obtain new exact analytical results. Specifically, we derive an explicit large deviation function for the first-passage time distribution in the subcritical regime and closed-form expressions for the conditional mean first-passage time for arbitrary offset. Despite its simplicity, this first crossing process exhibits non-trivial critical behavior and provides a rare example where all the main results of interest can be derived exactly.

Title: RKKY signatures as a probe of band properties and photoinduced topological phase transitions in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films
Authors: Ya-Xi Li, Rui-Qiang Wang, Ming-Xun Deng, Hou-Jian Duan
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films under both dark and illuminated conditions. In the dark, the intrinsic magnetism of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is shown to yield a stronger anisotropic RKKY spin model compared to nonmagnetic topological insulators, providing a clear signature for differentiating these systems. Furthermore, key band properties -- such as energy gap, band degeneracy/splitting, and topological deformations of the Fermi surface -- imprint distinct signatures on the RKKY interaction, enabling clear discrimination between even- and odd-septuple-layer (SL) films. This discrimination manifests in multiple ways: through the Fermi-energy dependence or spatial oscillations of the interaction for impurities on the same surface, or via the presence versus absence of spin-frustrated terms for those on different surfaces. Under off-resonant circularly polarized light, we track photoinduced topological phase transitions and identify two characteristic signatures at the phase boundary: a sign reversal in spin-frustrated terms and a dip in collinear RKKY components. These serve as fingerprints for circular-polarization-chirality-dependent topological transitions in even- and odd-SL films, respectively. Overall, this work establishes RKKY interactions as a sensitive magnetic probe for revealing both distinctive band properties and light-driven phase transitions in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films, thereby complementing conventional electrical measurements while providing new insights into the influence of intrinsic magnetism on the surface-state band structure.

Title: Chemical heterogeneity at conducting ferroelectric domain walls
Authors: Kasper A. Hunnestad, Guo-Dong Zhao, Mao-Hua Zhang, Tiannan Yang, Elzbieta Gradauskaite, Antonius T. J. van Helvoort, Morgan Trassin, Long-Qing Chen, Tadej Rojac, Dennis Meier
Abstract: Natural interfaces in ferroic oxides have developed into versatile playgrounds for studying electronic correlation effects in 2D systems. The microscopic origin of the emergent local electronic properties is often debated, however, as quantitative atomic-scale characterization remains challenging. A prime example is enhanced conductivity at ferroelectric domain walls, attributed to mechanisms ranging from local band gap reduction to point defect accumulations. Here, we resolve the microscopic mechanisms for domain wall conduction in the ferroelectric model system BiFeO3, by combining transport measurements with atom probe tomography to quantify the local chemical composition and correlate it with the electrical properties. Significant chemical variations along the walls are observed, demonstrating an outstanding chemical flexibility at domain walls, which manifest in spatially varying physical properties. The results give a unifying explanation for the diverse electronic behavior observed and establish the fundamental notion that multiple conduction mechanisms can coexist within individual domain walls.

Title: Probing the Dynamical Structure Factor of Quantum Spin Chains via Low-Temperature Gibbs States with Matrix Product State Subspace Expansion
Authors: Tomoya Takahashi, Wei-Lin Tu, Ji-Yao Chen, Yusuke Nomura
Abstract: Studying finite-temperature properties with tensor networks is notoriously difficult, especially at low temperatures, due to the rapid growth of entanglement and the complexity of thermal states. Existing methods like purification and minimally entangled typical thermal states offer partial solutions but struggle with scalability and accuracy in low-temperature regime. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach based on generating-function matrix product states (GFMPS). By directly computing a large set of Bloch-type excited states, we construct Gibbs states that moderate the area-law constraint, enabling accurate and efficient approximation of low-temperature thermal behavior. Our benchmark results show magnificent agreement with both exact diagonalization and experimental observations, validating the accuracy of our approach. This method offers a promising new direction for overcoming the longstanding challenges of studying low-temperature properties within the tensor network framework. We also expect that our method will facilitate the numerical simulation of quantum materials in comparison with experimental observations.

Title: The Diffusion Kinetics of Ba Cations in Perovskite BaTiO$_3$: A Combined Tracer Diffusion and Metadynamics Study
Authors: Sylvia Koerfer, Bianca Dißmann, Norman Schier, Han-Ill Yoo, Manfred Martin, Roger A. De Souza
Abstract: Tracer diffusion experiments and metadynamics (MtD) simulations were used to study the diffusion of Ba cations in the cubic phase of the perovskite oxide BaTiO$_3$. $^{130}$BaTiO$_3$ thin films were used as diffusion sources to introduce barium tracer diffusion profiles into single-crystal samples at temperatures $1348 \leq T/\mathrm{K} \leq 1498$. The $^{130}$Ba profiles were determined by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and then analysed to yield Ba tracer diffusion coefficients ($D_\mathrm{Ba}^\ast$). MtD simulations were performed in order to obtain barium-vacancy diffusion coefficients ($D_\mathrm{v_{Ba}}$) for selected vacancy mechanisms as a function of temperature. $D_\mathrm{v_{Ba}}$ is predicted to be increased significantly by an adjacent oxygen vacancy, and even more, by an adjacent titanium vacancy. From the combined consideration of $D_\mathrm{Ba}^\ast$ and $D_\mathrm{v_{Ba}}$, we conclude that Ba diffusion in these samples occurred most probably by the migration of defect associates, and not by the migration of isolated barium vacancies. More generally, our results draw attention to the dangers of relying solely on activation enthalpies to interpret diffusion data.

Title: Field report from Collaborative Research Center 1625: Heterogeneous research data management using ontology representations
Authors: Doaa Mohamed, Samuel García Vázquez, Behnam Mardani, Victor Dudarev, Alfred Ludwig, Maribel Acosta, Markus Stricker
Abstract: The goal of the Collaborative Research Center 1625 is the establishment of a scientific basis for the atomic-scale understanding and design of multifunctional compositionally complex solid solution surfaces. Next to materials synthesis in form of thin-film materials libraries, various materials characterization and simulations techniques are used to explore the materials data space of the problem. Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques guide its exploration and navigation. The effective use of the combined heterogeneous data requires more than just a simple research data management plan. Consequently, our research data management system maps different data modalities in different formats and resolutions from different labs to the correct spatial locations on physical samples. Besides a graphical user interface, the system can also be accessed through an application programming interface for reproducible data-driven workflows. It is implemented by a combination of a custom research data management system designed around a relational database, an ontology which builds upon materials science-specific ontologies, and the construction of a Knowledge Graph. Along with the technical solutions of research data management system and lessons learned, first use cases are shown which were not possible (or at least much harder to achieve) without it.

Title: $\mathcal{R}$-transforms for Non-Hermitian Matrices: A Spherical Integral Approach
Authors: Pierre Bousseyroux, Marc Potters
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a connection between the formalism of $\mathcal{R}$-transforms for non-Hermitian random matrices and the framework of spherical integrals, using the replica method. This connection was previously proved in the Hermitian setting and in the case of bi-invariant random matrices. We show that the $\mathcal{R}$-transforms used in the non-Hermitian context in fact originate from a single scalar function of two variables. This provides a new and transparent way to compute $\mathcal{R}$-transforms, which until now had been known only in restricted cases such as bi-invariant, Hermitian, or elliptic ensembles.

Title: Molecular-based coordination polymer as reversible and precise acetonitrile electro-optical readout
Authors: Esther Resines-Urien, Enrique Burzurí, Estefania Fernandez-Bartolome, Miguel Ángel García García-Tuñón, Patricia de la Presa, Roberta Poloni, Simon J. Teat, Jose Sanchez Costa
Abstract: Efficient detection of harmful organic volatile compounds is a major health and environmental need in industrialized societies. Tailor-made metal-organic frameworks and other coordination polymers are emerging as promising sensing molecular materials thanks to their responsivity to a wide variety of external stimuli, and could be used to complement conventional sensors. Here, a non-porous crystalline 1D Fe(II) coordination polymer acting as a porous acetonitrile host is presented. The desorption of interstitial acetonitrile is accompanied by magneto-structural transitions easily detectable in the optical and electronic properties of the material. The structural switch and therefore its (opto)electronic readout are reversible under exposition of the crystal to acetonitrile vapor. Coordination polymers can be versatile sensors for volatile acetonitrile and potentially other organic compounds.

Title: Interplay of Micellar Architecture and Viscosity Governs Active Droplet Motility
Authors: Salini Kar, Rohit V. Menon, Sanbed Das, Parth Pandya, Sayantan Dutta, Mithun Chowdhury
Abstract: The autonomous motion of liquid crystal oil droplets in micellar media arises from spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry via nonlinear coupling between Marangoni stresses and surfactant transport. While this phenomenon has been widely studied, the influence of micellar solute structure remains unexplored. By modifying micellar architecture using a structure forming salt, we uncover a pronounced non monotonic dependence of droplet velocity on salt concentration. Increasing salt simultaneously raises the medium viscosity and drives a transition of micelles from spherical to rod-like or worm like morphologies. Using complementary experiments, we quantify the viscosity and micellar interaction lengthscale as functions of the salt to surfactant ratio and develop a theoretical model that consistently reproduces the measured propulsion speeds. Flow fields around the droplets are characterized by particle image velocimetry. Our results demonstrate that salt surfactant composition governs active droplet propulsion by jointly controlling micellar solute interaction lengthscales and medium viscosity.

Title: Batch-Fabricated PDMS Templates for the Robotic Transfer of 2D Materials
Authors: Zhili Lin, Luosha Han, Jinkun He, Xiaoxue Fan, Tongyao Zhang, Xiaoxi Li, Baojuan Dong, Kai Zhao
Abstract: Robotic stacking of van der Waals heterostructures has been at the verge thanks to the convergence between artificial intelligence (AI) and two-dimensional (2D) materials research. Key ingredients to fulfill this pursuit often include algorithms to identify layer compounds on chips, hard-wares to realize sophisticated operations of motion and/or rotation in a microscale, and, as importantly, highly-standardized and uniform transfer stamps that are often used in picking up layered materials under a microscope. Here, we report a hot-casted-droplet batch fabrication method for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) templates tailored for dry transfer of 2D materials. Controlled precursor formulation, degassing, and motorized-syringe dispensing produce dome-shaped PDMS templates with ultra-smooth surfaces (root-mean-square roughness about 0.3 nm at relatively low curing temperatures). By tuning the curing temperature, the reproducible and controllable apex curvature allows precisely defined contact area between the organic adhesive film and substrate, via thermal expansion. Our results further reveals thermalmechanical behaviors with different casting parameters of such PDMS domes. This scalable and parameterized fabrication protocol gives rise to uniform transfer-stamps with ultra-smooth surface, which may be beneficial for future AI-driven robotic assembly of 2D material heterostructures.

Title: Interface effects and dielectric mismatch in ultrathin silicon on insulator films
Authors: Andrea Pulici, Gabriele Seguini, Fabiana Taglietti, Roman Gumeniuk, Riccardo Chiarcos, Michele Laus, Johannes Heitmann, Marco Fanciulli, Michele Perego
Abstract: The role of interface states and dielectric mismatch is studied in ultrathin P-doped silicon-on-insulator (SOI) films with thickness of the device layer ($H_{SOI}$) varying from 30 to 8 nm and dopant concentration ($n_{D}$) ranging from 10$^{18}$ to nearly 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$. P concentration is determined by Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Sample resistivity ($\rho$), carrier concentration ($n_e$), and mobility ($\mu_e$) are extracted by combining sheet resistance and Hall measurements in van der Pauw configuration. When $H_{SOI}$ = 30 nm, transport properties at room temperature are fully compatible with those of a similarly doped bulk Si. Progressive 2D confinement by reduction of $H_{SOI}$ below 30 nm results in a reduction of the carrier concentration and a concomitant degradation of $\mu_e$. These effects, which are steadily enhanced decreasing $n_D$, are attributed to non-passivated interface states at the SiO$_2$/Si interface and can be significantly mitigated by high temperature rapid thermal oxidation (RTO). The effectiveness of this approach was verified by electron-paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements, which allowed the assessment of the quality of the RTO-SiO$_2$/Si interface and the correlation with observed electrical properties. After effective interface engineering, low temperature electrical characterization revealed a significant increase in P ionization energy in samples with $H_{SOI}$ <= 15 nm, a result directly related to the dielectric mismatch.

Title: Interactions of composite magnetic skyrmion-superconducting vortex pairs in ferromagnetic superconductors
Authors: Paul Leask, Calum Ross, Egor Babaev
Abstract: We study composite topological excitations in ferromagnetic superconductors consisting of bound states of magnetic spin textures (skyrmions) and superconducting vortices. Using a Ginzburg--Landau framework with Zeeman coupling between the magnetization and superconducting magnetic field, we demonstrate that skyrmion-vortex pairs (SVPs) form energetically stable bound states. By analyzing their asymptotic interactions, we identify regimes in which SVPs exhibit both short-range repulsion and long-range attraction, leading to clustering phenomena. Our results provide a field-theoretical basis for understanding suggest pathways for controlling hybrid topological matter through long-range interactions.

Title: Quasiparticle to local moment crossover in bad metals
Authors: A. Chen, F. B. Kugler, P. Doležal, Y. Saito, A. Kawamoto, A. Georges, A. Pustogow
Abstract: Non-Fermi-liquid charge transport in the vicinity of electronic instabilities has been intensely studied for decades. Deviations from $\rho_{\rm FL}=\rho_0+AT^2$ in bad and strange metals are commonly ascribed to a breakdown of Landau's quasiparticle (QP) concept. Yet, it remains unclear what mechanism drives the temperature dependence of $\rho(T)$ beyond $\rho_{\rm FL}$. Here, we examine the bad metal upon approaching the Mott metal-insulator transition via chemical pressure in $\kappa$-[(BEDT-STF)$_x$(BEDT-TTF)$_{1-x}$]$\rm _2 Cu_2 (CN)_3$. Through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transport experiments on the same single crystals, we directly link the onset of deviations from Korringa law $(T_1T)^{-1} = \mathrm{const.}$ with the rise of $\rho(T)$ beyond $\rho_{\rm FL}$. From the NMR relaxation rate, we can identify the gradual crossover between the QP-dominated regime at low $T$ to predominant local moments at higher $T$. By comparing our experimental findings with dynamical mean-field theory calculations, which accurately reproduce the transport data, we reveal how this crossover is reflected in $T$-dependent changes of the QP spectrum. Near the Mott insulator, where $d\rho/dT<0$ at high $T$, an Einstein-relation analysis shows that bad-metal behavior with $d\rho/dT>0$ is driven by the temperature dependence of the electronic compressibility rather than the diffusion constant.

Title: Topological connections between the 2D Quantum Hall problem and the 1D quasicrystal
Authors: Anuradha Jagannathan
Abstract: 1D quasicrystals such as the Fibonacci chain have been said to ``inherit" their topological properties from the 2D Quantum Hall problem. Yet, a direct way to see the connection was lacking until a common ancestor, the Fibonacci-Hall model, was introduced recently \cite{aj2025}. This 2D ancestor model relates the role of the external magnetic flux in the Hall problem and that of a geometric flux which describes the winding of the quasicrystal in 2D, in the cut-and-project method. Doing this enables us to extend the notion of Chern numbers as defined in 2D, to the energy bands of the 1D chain by adiabatic continuity. The older notion of gap labels in the 1D system are now seen to be derivable from the Chern numbers of the 2D bands. The Fibonacci-Hall model thus provides an important link between physics of two paradigmatic models, the Fibonacci quasicrystal and the quantum Hall insulator. The generalization to other 1D quasiperiodic models is expected to be relatively straightforward. The extension to 2D cut-and-project tilings is left for future studies.

Title: Structural Comparison of Error Mitigation Methods for Ising Machines: Penalty-Spin Model versus Stacked Model
Authors: Tetsuro Abe, Kanta Hino, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: Error-mitigation methods for Ising machines are reexamined not merely as noise-suppression techniques but as a structural design problem of replica-coupled Ising models. Using simulated annealing as a hardware-noise-free testbed, we systematically compare the penalty-spin (PS) model, which couples replicas through a centralized auxiliary layer, with the stacked model, which couples adjacent replicas directly. Numerical experiments on the quadratic assignment problem reveal that the ferromagnetically coupled stacked model stably maintains constraint satisfaction and improves solution quality over a broad parameter range, exhibiting favorable scalability with both the number of replicas and problem size. In contrast, the PS model suffers from cooperation collapse at large parallelism: many-replica averaging in the PS layer washes out sparse solution information, preventing effective inter-replica coordination. These findings demonstrate that the topology of inter-replica couplings decisively influences search robustness, and provide practical guidelines for model selection and parameter tuning in constrained optimization.

Title: Facets of Many Body Localization
Authors: Konrad Pawlik, Maksym Prodius, Pedro R. Nicácio Falcão, Jakub Zakrzewski
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) appears to be a robust example of ergodicity breaking in many-body interacting systems. Here, we review different aspects of MBL, concentrating on various ways the disorder may be introduced into the system studied. In particular, we consider both the random and quasiperiodic diagonal (i.e., on-site) disorder as well as bond disorder as realized in randomly distributed atoms interacting via long-range interactions. We also review the quantum sun model, which seems to be the ideal, albeit artificial, model exhibiting MBL.

Title: Ab initio study of carrier mobility in Bi$_2$O$_2$Se
Authors: Yubo Yuan, Ziye Zhu, Jiaming Hu, Wenbin Li
Abstract: Bi$_2$O$_2$Se is an emerging high-performance layered semiconductor with excellent stability. While experimental studies have explored carrier transport across various doping levels for both $n$-type and $p$-type conduction, a comprehensive theoretical understanding remains incomplete. In this work, we present parameter-free first-principles calculations of the electron and hole mobilities in Bi$_2$O$_2$Se, based on iterative solution of the Boltzmann transport equation that includes electron-phonon scattering and ionized impurity scattering on an equal footing. Intriguingly, we find that Bi$_2$O$_2$Se exhibits high electron mobilities in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, whereas the hole mobilities are only significant in the in-plane direction, displaying a unique three-dimensional (3D) electron transport and two-dimensional (2D) hole transport behavior. At 300~K, the calculated intrinsic electron and hole mobilities along the in-plane direction are 447~$\mathrm{cm^2\,V^{-1}\,s^{-1}}$ and 29~$\mathrm{cm^2\,V^{-1}\,s^{-1}}$, respectively, which are primarily affected by Fröhlich electron-phonon interactions. Due to its large static dielectric permittivity, Bi$_2$O$_2$Se exhibits an exceptionally high low-temperature electron mobilities above $1.0\times10^5~\mathrm{cm^2\,V^{-1}\,s^{-1}}$, and its electron mobilities above 50~K is robust against ionized impurity scattering over a wide range of impurity concentrations. By incorporating the Hall effect into our analysis, we predict an in-plane electron Hall mobility of 517~$\mathrm{cm^2\,V^{-1}\,s^{-1}}$ at 300~K, in excellent agreement with experimental data. These results provide valuable insights into the carrier transport mechanisms in Bi$_2$O$_2$Se, and offer predictive benchmarks for future theoretical and experimental investigations.

Title: Nanoscale Spatial Tuning of Superconductivity in Cuprate Thin Films via Direct Laser Writing
Authors: Irene Biancardi, Valerio Levati, Jordi Alcalà, Thomas Günkel, Nicolas Lejeune, Alejandro V. Silhanek, Valeria Russo, Narcís Mestres, Daniela Petti, Anna Palau, Edoardo Albisetti
Abstract: Cuprate high-temperature superconductors, such as Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO), are extremely promising for emerging technologies such as low-power computing, data storage, quantum sensors and superconducting electronics. However, the realization of high-performance functional nanostructures presents formidable challenges due to the difficulty of applying conventional nanofabrication methods to such sensitive materials, making the search for alternative methods a key enabling factor. Since YBCO's superconducting and normal-state properties are highly dependent on oxygen stoichiometry, precise nanoscale control of the oxygen content represents a highly appealing approach for creating advanced nanoengineered devices. In this work, we demonstrate the precise fabrication of sub-micrometer, grayscale patterns over large areas in epitaxial YBCO thin films, achieving finely tuned optical and superconducting transport properties by locally controlling the stoichiometry through maskless direct laser writing under ambient conditions. Cryogenic magneto-optical imaging and transport measurements in irradiated devices directly demonstrate the spatial tuning of the critical temperature and carrier density with the patterning conditions. Correlated Raman microscopy and reflectometry of the patterned regions indicate a laser-power dependent oxygen depletion in the irradiated regions. The proposed laser-controlled stoichiometry approach provides a direct and scalable method to navigate the phase diagram of high-Tc superconducting oxides, offering new possibilities for integrating functional nanostructures into superconducting devices.

Title: Is it possible to determine unambiguously the Berry phase solely from quantum oscillations?
Authors: Bogdan M. Fominykh, Valentin Yu. Irkhin, Vyacheslav V. Marchenkov
Abstract: The Berry phase, a fundamental geometric phase in quantum systems, has become a crucial tool for probing the topological properties of materials. Quantum oscillations, such as Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations, are widely used to extract this phase, but its unambiguous determination remains challenging. This work highlights the inherent ambiguities in interpreting the oscillation phase solely from SdH data, primarily due to the influence of the spin factor $R_S$, which depends on the Landé $g$-factor and effective mass. While the Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) theory provides a framework for analyzing oscillations, the unknown g-factor introduces significant uncertainty. For instance, a zero oscillation phase could arise either from a nontrivial Berry phase or a negative $R_S$. We demonstrate that neglecting $R_S$ in modern studies, especially for topological materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, can lead to doubtful conclusions. Through theoretical analysis and numerical examples, we show how the interplay between the Berry phase and Zeeman effect complicates phase determination. Additionally, we also discuss another underappreciated mechanism - the magnetic field dependence of the Fermi level. Our discussion underscores the need for complementary experimental techniques to resolve these ambiguities and calls for further research to refine the interpretation of quantum oscillations in topological systems.

Title: Lattice fermion simulation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking in a helical Luttinger liquid
Authors: V. A. Zakharov, J. Sánchez Fernán, C. W. J. Beenakker
Abstract: We extend a recently developed "tangent fermion" method to discretize the Hamiltonian of a helical Luttinger liquid on a one-dimensional lattice, including two-particle backscattering processes that may open a gap in the spectrum. The fermion-doubling obstruction of the sine dispersion is avoided by working with a tangent dispersion, preserving the time-reversal symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The numerical results from a tensor network calculation on a finite lattice confirm the expectation from infinite-system analytics, that a gapped phase with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry emerges when the Fermi level is tuned to the Dirac point and the Luttinger parameter crosses a critical value.

Title: Dynamical Stabilization of Inverted Magnetization and Antimagnons by Spin Injection in an Extended Magnetic System
Authors: Emir Karadza, Hanchen Wang, Niklas Kercher, Paul Noel, William Legrand, Richard Schlitz, Pietro Gambardella
Abstract: Dynamical perturbations can modify the energy landscape of a physical system, such that unstable equilibrium configurations become stable when subject to an external drive. The magnetic analog of such dynamical stabilization corresponds to saturation of the magnetization against an external field. Here we report dynamical stabilization of the magnetization in thin film bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet by spin current injection from an adjacent Pt layer. Magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements demonstrate magnetization reversal against magnetic fields up to 3000 times larger than the film's coercivity once the spin injection surpasses a critical threshold associated with negative damping. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that this process is mediated by the excitation of a large population of incoherent magnons with non-zero wave vector, leading to a transient shortening and subsequent stabilization of the inverted magnetization. The elementary excitations of the high-energy inverted magnetization state are shown to be antimagnons, quasi-particles carrying opposite energy and spin relative to magnons. Our results further reveal how the system's size and minimization of nonlinear magnon scattering processes play a key role in dynamical stabilization, opening new avenues for magnetic state control beyond conventional magnetization switching. Dissipation-driven phase transitions in large-area magnetic systems provide a solid-state platform to study magnonic analogs of relativistic phenomena, such as Klein tunneling and black holes, as well as spin-wave amplification and lasing.

Title: Brownian motion with soft constraints in soft matter systems
Authors: Sophie Marbach, Adam Carter, Miranda Holmes-Cerfon
Abstract: Stiff forces, which bind objects together or otherwise confine motion, are found widely in soft-matter systems - colloids with short range attractions, ligand-receptor contacts, particles in optical traps, fibres that resist stretching, etc. To assess the long-term effect of these stiff forces on dynamics and structure, it is useful to consider the limit where they are treated as constraints, so the system evolves strictly within allowed configurations. Efforts to derive equations involving both constraints, and the stochastic motion appropriate at the scales of soft matter, began around 50 years ago, yet, we are still lacking a straightforward way to extract the projected equations and apply them in modern formulations of mesoscale dynamics. Here, we address this gap with two key contributions: (1) a practical summary of the constrained Brownian dynamics equations with ``soft'' constraints, i.e. constraints imposed by stiff forces, which is illustrated through several representative examples, taking care to highlight the nontrivial effects of the constraints; and (2) a novel derivation using singular perturbation theory, establishing the validity of these equations over timescales exceeding the relaxation of stiffly constrained degrees of freedom. We further extend our approach to ``soft soft'' constraints, where mobility varies on lengthscales comparable to the restraining forces - a scenario typical for particles in fluids experiencing hydrodynamic interactions. We hope our results will be useful for soft matter research, as a robust toolkit for studying tethered or confined systems.

Title: Submicrometer tunnel ferromagnetic Josephson junctions with transmon energy scale
Authors: R. Satariano, R. Ferraiuolo, F. Calloni, H. G. Ahmad, D. Gatta, F. Tafuri, A. Bruno, D. Massarotti
Abstract: We have realized submicron tunnel ferromagnetic Al/AlO$_x$/Al/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$/Al Josephson junctions (JJs) in Manhattan-style configuration for qubit applications. These junctions have been designed to lie within the energy range of transmons. The current-voltage characteristics of these junctions are comparable with those of standard JJs implemented in state-of-the-art transmons, thus confirming the high quality of the devices and marking a significant step toward the realization of the ferrotransmon. Low-frequency characterization confirms that our junctions operate in the quantum phase diffusion limit, as tunnel JJs in conventional transmons with similar characteristic energies. Ultimately, mitigation of quantum phase fluctuations will represent a key for advancing the entire field of superconducting quantum circuit architectures.

Title: Ferroelectric polarization mapping through pseudosymmetry-sensitive EBSD reindexing
Authors: Claire Griesbach, Tizian Scharsach, Morgan Trassin, Dennis M. Kochmann
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials exhibit a switchable, spontaneous polarization at the unit cell level--an attractive property utilized in many emerging technologies including, among others, high-density memory storage, low-power transistors, and high-speed fiber optic communication. Understanding the local polarization switching behavior, through domain nucleation and evolution, is critical to advancing these technologies and requires characterization of the local domain microstructure. However, in application-relevant polycrystalline materials exhibiting a distribution of grain orientations, a direct mapping of the polarization direction in three dimensions has remained inaccessible using conventional experimental approaches. Here, taking barium titanate single crystals and lead zirconium titanate polycrystals as our bulk model systems, we map the local polarization directions using a new electron backscatter diffraction indexing technique based on simulated pattern-matching. Through improved pre-processing techniques (including optimized pattern processing, a new pseudosymmetry-sensitive neighbor pattern averaging method, and DIC-based global sample-detector geometry calibration) and a new pseudosymmetry confidence index (which considers not only pattern similarity but pattern dissimilarity trends with other domain variant patterns), we successfully distinguish between the six polarization directions, despite the challengingly small unit cell aspect ratio of the selected materials. The methods developed in this work are not only applicable to ferroelectrics but any material which exhibits close crystallographic pseudosymmetries--extending the current capabilities of EBSD.

Title: Light-induced Magnetization by Quantum Geometry
Authors: Hiroki Yoshida, Takehito Yokoyama
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for the inverse Faraday and the inverse Cotton--Mouton effects arising from quantum geometry, characterized by the quantum metric quadrupole and the weighted quantum metric. Within a semiclassical framework based on the Boltzmann transport theory, we establish a general formalism describing light-induced magnetization in electronic systems as a second-order response to the electric field of light. Using continuum and tight-binding models, we discuss the symmetry constraints on these effects and estimate the magnitudes of the resulting magnetizations. Our results highlight a direct manifestation of quantum-geometric quantities in nonlinear magneto-optical responses and suggest a viable pathway for experimental detection.

Title: Geometric dependence of exchange bias in tilted three-dimensional CoFe/IrMn microwires
Authors: Balram Singh, Aman Singh, Stefan Mikulik, Jakub Jurczyk, Volker Neu, Amalio Fernández-Pacheco
Abstract: The exchange bias (EB) effect, arising from interfacial coupling between ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) layers, induces a unidirectional magnetic anisotropy and underpins a wide range of spintronic functionalities. Extending the EB effect to three-dimensional (3D) architectures enables investigation of interfacial coupling in non-planar structures, which is a key step toward realizing spintronic functionalities beyond planar systems. Achieving this requires the fabrication of FM/AF bilayers with smooth interfaces and well-defined thicknesses on non-planar scaffolds, together with suitable characterization methods. In this work, we realize exchange-biased 3D FM/AF microwires by combining two-photon lithography with magnetron sputtering. CoFe/IrMn bilayers are deposited on microwire scaffolds with inclination angles of 0 deg, 30 deg, 45 deg relative to the substrate, and their magnetization reversal is probed using dark-field magneto-optical Kerr effect (DF-MOKE) magnetometry. We find that the EB and coercive fields vary in a characteristic way with the inclination angle, consistent with the systematic reduction in film thickness expected from inclined directional deposition. In addition, the EB magnitude is influenced by the combined effects of surface roughness of non-planar geometries and the directional growth of the bilayer, highlighting the importance of 3D scaffold surface quality for integrating magnetic multilayers. These results provide insight into the growth and magnetic behavior of sputter-deposited magnetic multilayers with functional interfaces on 3D geometries.

Title: Controlling thermal conductivity in harmonic chains with correlated mass and bond disorder: Analytical approach
Authors: I. F. Herrera-González
Abstract: We investigate heat transport in one-dimensional harmonic chains with mass disorder and weak bond disorder, coupled at both ends to oscillator heat baths through weak impedance mismatches. The model incorporates correlations in mass disorder, in bond disorder, and between the two. We find that the scaling of thermal conductivity $\kappa$ with system size $N$ is determined solely by either mass disorder or bond disorder. This indicates that cross-correlations between the two types of disorder play no important role in the scaling behavior of $\kappa$. Consequently, by tuning the self-correlations, it is possible to control how the thermal conductivity scales with the system size. Such control could have potential applications in thermoelectric devices and thermal insulation technologies.

Title: Disorder-induced strong-field strong-localization in 2D systems
Authors: Yi Huang, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: A recent STM experiment in 2D bilayer graphene [Y.-C. Tsui, et al., Nature 628, 287 (2024)], under a strong perpendicular magnetic field, has made a direct observation of the existence of three distinct filling-factor-dependent quantum phases in the lowest Landau level: the incompressible fractional quantum Hall liquid, a crystalline compressible hexagonal Wigner crystal with long-range order and rotational symmetry-breaking, and a random localized solid phase with no spatial order. We argue that the spatially random localized phase at low filling is the recently proposed disorder-dominated strongly localized amorphous "Anderson solid" phase [A. Babber, et al., arXiv:2601.03521], which appears generically at a sample-dependent filling factor.

Title: Electronic structure and elasticity of the Ta-W solid solution
Authors: Kareem Abdelmaqsoud, John R. Kitchin, Michael Widom
Abstract: The brittleness or ductility of metals has long been attributed to their elastic constants, with high Poisson ratio, or equivalently high Pugh ratio, favoring greater ductility. Growing evidence links ductility with their electronic structure. Consequently, it is desirable to understand how the electronic structure affects the elastic constants. Here, we examine the Ta-W binary alloy system, which evolves from ductile character at Ta-rich compositions to brittleness at high W. We show that a change in slope of the composition-dependent shear modulus near the equiatomic composition coincides with an abrupt change in the Fermi level density of states. We relate the behaviors of the elastic constants to the characters of occupied electronic orbitals close to the Fermi level. Finally, we consider additional alloy systems from groups V and VI and show that qualitatively similar behavior occurs more broadly.

Title: Revisiting Jahn--Teller Transitions in Correlated Oxides with Monte Carlo Modeling
Authors: Liam A. V. Nagle-Cocco, Andrew L. Goodwin, Clare P. Grey, Siân E. Dutton
Abstract: Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $\rho$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.

Title: A melonic quantum mechanical model without disorder
Authors: Anna Biggs, Loki Lin, Juan Maldacena
Abstract: We consider a quantum mechanical model involving interacting fermions without disorder that has the same low energy physics as the supersymmetric SYK model. The model is $SU(2)$ invariant, and the supercharge involves the $ SU(2) $ 3j symbol. We analyze various solvable corners, conceptually explain why it has a melonic expansion, and perform an exact diagonalization for small values of $N$. Expanded around the states with maximal angular momentum, the model is approximated by a two dimensional CFT. The BPS states have a simple description in that regime.

Title: Observation of Unidirectional s-p Orbital Topological Edge States in Driven Photonic Lattices
Authors: Gayathry Rajeevan, Sebabrata Mukherjee
Abstract: Time-periodic modulation of a static system is a powerful method for realizing robust unidirectional topological states. So far, all such realizations have been based on interactions among $s$ orbitals, without incorporating inter-orbital couplings. Here, we demonstrate higher-orbital Floquet topological insulators by introducing periodically modulated couplings between the optical $s$ and $p$ orbitals in a square lattice. The staggered phase of the $s$-$p$ couplings gives rise to a synthetic uniform $\pi$ magnetic flux per plaquette of the lattice, and periodic driving of the couplings opens a topological bandgap, characterized by the Floquet winding number. We image topological edge modes of $s$-$p$ orbitals traveling unidirectionally around a corner. Here, the topological phases are realized by a combined effect of the periodic driving and synthetic magnetic flux. Consequently, when the synthetic flux is turned off, the system becomes trivial over a range of driving parameters. Our results open a promising pathway for exploring topological phenomena by introducing the orbital degree of freedom.

Title: Casimir effect with dielectric matter in salted water and implications at the cell scale
Authors: Larissa Inácio, Felipe S. S. Rosa, Astrid Lambrecht, Paulo A. Maia Neto, Serge Reynaud
Abstract: The Casimir interaction in salted water contains a universal contribution of electromagnetic fluctuations that makes it of a longer range than previously thought. The universal contribution dominates non universal ones at the distances relevant for actin fibers inside the cell. We discuss universal and non-universal contributions with a model mimicking biological matter. We also show that the universal Casimir effect should have important implications at the cell scale.

Title: Probabilistic Computers for MIMO Detection: From Sparsification to 2D Parallel Tempering
Authors: M Mahmudul Hasan Sajeeb, Corentin Delacour, Kevin Callahan-Coray, Sanjay Seshan, Tathagata Srimani, Kerem Y. Camsari
Abstract: Probabilistic computers built from p-bits offer a promising path for combinatorial optimization, but the dense connectivity required by real-world problems scales poorly in hardware. Here, we address this through graph sparsification with auxiliary copy variables and demonstrate a fully on-chip parallel tempering solver on an FPGA. Targeting MIMO detection, a dense, NP-hard problem central to wireless communications, we fit 15 temperature replicas of a 128-node sparsified system (1,920 p-bits) entirely on-chip and achieve bit error rates significantly below conventional linear detectors. We report complete end-to-end solution times of 4.7 ms per instance, with all loading, sampling, readout, and verification overheads included. ASIC projections in 7 nm technology indicate about 90 MHz operation with less than 200 mW power dissipation, suggesting that massive parallelism across multiple chips could approach the throughput demands of next-generation wireless systems. However, sparsification introduces sensitivity to the copy-constraint strength. Employing Two-Dimensional Parallel Tempering (2D-PT), which exchanges replicas across both temperature and constraint dimensions, we demonstrate over 10X faster convergence without manual parameter tuning. These results establish an on-chip p-bit architecture and a scalable algorithmic framework for dense combinatorial optimization.

Title: Mechanistic principles of exciton-polariton relaxation
Authors: Ian Haines, Arshath Manjalingal, Logan Blackham, Saeed Rahamanian Koshkaki, Arkajit Mandal
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons are light-matter hybrid quasi-particles that have emerged as a flexible platform for developing quantum technologies and engineering material properties. However, the fundamental mechanistic principles that govern their dynamics and relaxation remain elusive. In this work, we provide the microscopic mechanistic understanding of the exciton-polariton relaxation process that follows from an excitation in the upper polariton. Using both mixed quantum-classical simulations and analytical analysis, we reveal that phonon-induced upper-to-lower polariton relaxation proceeds via two steps: the first step is a vertical inter-band transition from the upper to the lower polariton, which is followed by a second step that is a phonon-induced Fröhlich scattering within the lower polariton. We find that in materials of finite thickness (which include filled cavities), phonon-induced polaritonic intraband Fröhlich scattering is significantly suppressed. We show that the microscopic origin of this suppression is phonon-fluctuations synchronization (or self-averaging) due to the polaritonic spatial delocalization in the quantization direction. Finally, we show that the same phonon fluctuation-synchronization effect plays a central role across polaritonic relaxation pathways, and we derive simple analytical expressions that relate a material's finite thickness to the corresponding relaxation rate constants.

Title: A theory of state-to-state transitions based on the framework of classical reaction dynamics
Authors: Kento Kasahara, Ryo Okabe, Chia-en A. Chang, Toshifumi mori, Nobuyuki Matubayasi
Abstract: We propose a new method to describe the population dynamics of distinct configurational states based on a continuous-time description of state-to-state transitions. According to classical reaction dynamics theory, the probability density associated with a given state obeys the Liouville equation, the probability density associate d with a given state obeys the Li ouville equation, including influx from and efflux to neighboring states. By introducing a Markov approximation for the crossing of boundaries separating the states, tractable integral equations governing the state populations are derived. Once the time-dependent quantities appearing in these equations are evaluated, the population dynamics on long timescales can be obtained. Because these quantities depend only on a few states in the local neighborhood of a given state, they can be computed using a set of short-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We apply the present method to the binding and unbinding kinetics of CH$_4$/CH$_4$, Na$^+$/Cl$^-$, and 18-crown-6-ether (crown ether)/K$^+$ in water. For both kinetics, the time constants estimated from the present method are almost comparable to those obtained from brute-force MD simulations. The required timescale of each MD trajectory in the present method is approximately two orders of magnitude shorter than that in the brute-force MD approach in the crown ether/K$^+$ system. This reduction in the trajectory timescale enables applications to complex binding and unbinding sy stems whose characteristic timescales a re far beyond those directly acce ssible by brute-force MD simulati ons.

Title: Matrix product operator representations for the local conserved quantities of the spin-$1/2$ XYZ chain
Authors: Kohei Fukai, Kyoichi Yamada
Abstract: We present explicit matrix product operator (MPO) representations for the local conserved quantities of the spin-$1/2$ XYZ chain. Through these MPO representations, we simplify the coefficients appearing in the local conserved quantities originally derived by one of the authors, and reveal their combinatorial meaning: the coefficients prove to be a polynomial generalization of the Catalan numbers, defined via weighted monotonic lattice paths. Furthermore, we obtain a new simple $3 \times 3$ Lax operator for the XYZ chain that, unlike Baxter's R-matrix, does not involve elliptic functions.

Title: Scale Invariance Breaking and Discrete Phase Invariance in Few-Body Problems
Authors: Satoshi Ohya
Abstract: Scale invariance in quantum mechanics can be broken in several ways. A well-known example is the breakdown of continuous scale invariance to discrete scale invariance, whose typical realization is the Efimov effect of three-body problems. Here we discuss yet another discrete symmetry to which continuous scale invariance can be broken: discrete phase invariance. We first revisit the one-body problem on the half line in the presence of an inverse-square potential -- the simplest example of nontrivial scale-invariant quantum mechanics -- and show that continuous scale invariance can be broken to discrete phase invariance in a small window of coupling constant. We also show that discrete phase invariance manifests itself as circularly distributed simple poles on Riemann sheets of the S-matrix. We then present three examples of few-body problems that exhibit discrete phase invariance. These examples are the one-body Aharonov-Bohm problem, a two-body problem of nonidentical particles in two dimensions, and a three-body problem of nonidentical particles in one dimension, all of which contain a codimension-two ``magnetic'' flux in configuration spaces.

Title: Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models for Metal-Organic Frameworks Structure Prediction
Authors: Mianzhi Pan, JianFei Li, Peishuo Liu, Botian Wang, Yawen Ouyang, Yiming Rong, Hao Zhou, Jianbing Zhang
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials with broad applications such as carbon capture and drug delivery, yet accurately predicting their 3D structures remains a significant challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MOF-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art denoising-based and LLM-based methods while exhibiting superior sampling efficiency.

Title: Relaxation Process During Complex Time Evolution In Two-Dimensional Integrable and Chaotic CFTs
Authors: Chen Bai, Weibo Mao, Masahiro Nozaki, Mao Tian Tan, Xueda Wen
Abstract: We investigate the complex time evolution of a vacuum state with the insertion of a local primary operator in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2d CFTs). This complex time evolution can be considered as a composite process constructed from Lorentzian time evolution and a Euclidean evolution induced by a post-selected measurement. Our main finding is that in the spatially-compact system, this complex time evolution drives the state of the subsystems to those of the primary state with the same conformal dimensions of the inserted operator. Contrary to the compact system, the subsystems of the spatially non-compact system evolve to states that depend on the non-unitary process during a certain time regime. In holographic systems with a compact spatial direction, this process induced by a heavy local operator can correspond to the relaxation from a black hole with an inhomogeneous horizon to that with a uniform one, while in the ones with a non-compact spatial direction, it can correspond to the relaxation to that with a horizon depending on the non-unitary process.

Title: Eigenstate Thermalization and Spectral Imprints of the Hamiltonian in Local Observables
Authors: Shivam Mishra, C Jisha, Ravi Prakash
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis explains thermalization in isolated quantum systems through the statistical properties of observables in the energy eigenbasis. We investigate the crossover from integrability to chaos in the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain, establishing a direct correspondence between the spectral correlations of the Hamiltonian and local observables expressed in the energy eigenbasis as a signature of ergodicity breaking. By introducing a local perturbation that drives the system from integrability to chaos, we track the standard ETH indicators and the eigenstate entanglement entropy. We introduce a submatrix-based framework for analyzing local observables in the energy eigenbasis. By extracting real-symmetric blocks along the diagonal of the local observables represented in eigenbasis, we show that these submatrices exhibit both the short-range and long-range spectral features of the Hamiltonian. Remarkably, this correspondence persists even in a partially ergodic regime, indicating that the emergence of chaos is already encoded locally within the observables' matrix structure and that small blocks are sufficient to capture the underlying spectral correlations.

Title: Genuine multipartite Rains entanglement
Authors: Hailey S. Murray, Sagnik Bhattacharya, M. Cerezo, Liuke Lyu, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: We introduce the genuine multipartite Rains entanglement (GMRE) as a measure of genuine multipartite entanglement that can be computed using semi-definite programming. Similar to the Rains relative entropy (its bipartite counterpart), the GMRE is monotone under selective quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of the partial transpose, implying that it is a multipartite entanglement monotone. As a consequence, we show that the GMRE bounds both the one-shot standard and probabilistic approximate GHZ-distillable entanglement from above. We also develop a generalization of this quantity that incorporates other entropies, including quantum Renyi relative entropies.

Title: Characterization of Silicon-Membrane TES Microcalorimeters for Large-Format X-ray Spectrometers with Integrated Microwave SQUID Readout

Ullom, Evan P. Jahrman, Thomas C. Allison, Sasawat Jamnuch, John Vinson, Charles J. Titus, Cherno Jaye, Daniel A. Fischer, Galen C. O'Neil
Abstract: We present the electro-thermal characterization of transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors suspended on Si membranes fabricated using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. The use of an all-silicon fabrication platform, in contrast to the more commonly used silicon nitride membranes, is compatible with monolithic fabrication of integrated TES and SQUID circuits. The all-silicon architecture additionally allows efficient use of focal plane area; the readout circuitry may be positioned out of the focal plane by bending a thinned portion of the chip. Compatibility with integrated fabrication and efficient use of focal plane area provide a path to an efficient soft X-ray spectrometer. This work is motivated by our goal to develop a 10,000-pixel TES spectrometer to overcome critical measurement limitations in catalysis research. The characterization of fragile, carbon-based intermediates via techniques like Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) is often precluded by the slow, high-flux nature of existing technologies. The new instrument will allow for fast RIXS measurements to be made without causing sample damage. We verify the detector models and measure the energy resolution using a pulsed optical laser, demonstrating the viability of this approach for the final instrument to be deployed at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II).

Title: Thermodynamic and ordering kinetics in asymmetric PS-b-PMMA block copolymer thin films
Authors: Gabriele Seguini, Fabio Zanenga, Gianluca Cannetti, Michele Perego
Abstract: The ordering kinetics of standing cylinder-forming polystyrene-block-poly (methyl methacrylate) block copolymers (molecular weight: 39 kg/mol) close to the order-disorder transition is experimentally investigated following the temporal evolution of the correlation length at different annealing temperatures. The grow exponent of the grain coarsening process is determined to be 1/2, signature of a curvature driven ordering mechanism. The measured activation enthalpy and the resulting Meyer-Neldel temperature for this specific copolymer along with the data already known for PS-b-PMMA block copolymers in strong segregation limit, allows investigating the interplay between the ordering kinetics and the thermodynamic driving force during the grain coarsening. These findings unveil various phenomena concomitantly occurring during the thermally activated ordering kinetics at segmental, single chain, and collective level.

Title: The interplay of phase fluctuations and nodal quasiparticles: ubiquitous Fermi arcs in two-dimensional d-wave superconductors
Authors: Xu-Cheng Wang, Xiao Yan Xu, Yang Qi
Abstract: We propose that the pseudogap and Fermi arcs can universally emerge due to thermal (static) phase fluctuations in the normal state of 2D nodal superconductors. By considering a minimal phenomenological model with spatially fluctuating superconducting pairings, we theoretically investigate the role of superconducting phase fluctuations in generic 2D superconductors with disorder-average technique. It is shown for nodal d-wave superconductors that phase fluctuations mediate the scattering of d-wave quasiparticles, smearing out the nodal quasiparticle gap and further leading to pseudogap and Fermi arcs. Moreover, the evolution of Fermi arcs is quantitatively described by two emergent characteristic length scales of the system: one is the finite superconducting correlation length $\xi(T)$, and another the nodal BCS coherence length $\xi_\text{BCS}(k)$. To support our theoretical findings, we numerically report the observation of Fermi arcs in a Hubbard-like model, proposed originally by X. Y. Xu and T. Grover in Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{126}$, 217002 (2021), with sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) calculations. As far as we noticed, it is the first time in a correlated model that phase-fluctuating Fermi arcs are identified with unbiased simulations. The numerical results for the scattering rate $\Gamma_\text{pf}$ of Cooper pairs exhibit excellent agreements with our theoretical predictions, where $\Gamma_\text{pf}$ is expected to scale linearly with the inverse superconducting correlation length $\xi(T)^{-1}$. This convergence of theory and numerics thereby strongly validates the universal connection between phase fluctuations and Fermi arcs in 2D nodal superconductors.

Title: GenL: An extensible fitting program for Laue oscillations and whole pattern fitting
Authors: Anna L. Ravensburg, Johan Bylin, Vassilios Kapaklis, Gunnar K. Pálsson
Abstract: GenL is a flexible program that can be used to simulate and/or fit X-ray reflectivity and X-ray diffraction data from epitaxial thin films exhibiting, for example, Laue oscillations. It utilizes a differential evolution within a genetic algorithm for fitting data and uses a modular approach based on either the kinematic theory of diffraction or the dynamic theory. Effects of polarization, absorption, the Lorentz factor, as well as instrumental resolution and lattice vibrations are taken into account. Useful parameters that can be extracted after fitting include atomic interplanar spacings, number of coherently scattering atomic planes, strain profiles along the film thickness, and crystal roughness. The program has been developed in MATLAB and employs a graphical user interface. The deployment strategy is twofold, whereby the software can either be obtained in source code form and executed within the MATLAB environment, or as a pre-compiled binary for those who prefer not to run it within MATLAB. Finally, GenL can be easily extended to simulate multilayered film systems, superlattices, and films with atomic steps. The program is released under the GNU General Public License.

Title: Machine learning aided parameter analysis in Perovskite X-ray Detector
Authors: Bobo Zhang, Endai Huang, Xinyi Du, Lu Zhang, Xiaokang Ma, Jiaxue You
Abstract: Many factors in perovskite X-ray detectors, such as crystal lattice and carrier dynamics, determine the final device performance (e.g., sensitivity and detection limit). However, the relationship between these factors remains unknown due to the complexity of the material. In this study, we employ machine learning to reveal the relationship between 15 intrinsic properties of halide perovskite materials and their device performance. We construct a database of X-ray detectors for the training of machine learning. The results show that the band gap is mainly influenced by the atomic number of the B-site metal, and the lattice length parameter b has the greatest impact on the carrier mobility-lifetime product ({\mu}{\tau}). An X-ray detector (m-F-PEA)2PbI4 were generated in the experiment and it further verified the accuracy of our ML models. We suggest further study on random forest regression for X-ray detector applications.

Title: Measurable geometric indicators of local plasticity in glasses
Authors: Amelia C. Y. Liu, Huyen Pham, Arabinda Bera, Timothy C. Petersen, Timothy W. Sirk, Stephen T. Mudie, Rico F. Tabor, Juan Nunez-Iglesias, Alessio Zaccone, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: The notion of defects in crystalline phases of matter has been extremely powerful for understanding crystal growth, deformation and melting. Many of these discontinuities in the periodic order of crystals are well described by the Burgers vector, derived from the particle displacements, which encapsulates the direction and magnitude of slip relative to the undeformed state. Since the reference structure of the crystal is known a priori, the Burgers vector can be determined experimentally using both imaging and diffraction methods to measure the final lattice distortion, and thus infer the particle displacements. Glasses have structures that lack the periodicity of crystals, and thus a well-defined reference state. Yet, measurable structural parameters can still be obtained from diffraction from a glass. Here we examine the usefulness of these parameters to probe deformation in glasses. We find that co-ordinated transformations in the centrosymmetry of local particle arrangements are a strong marker of plastic events. For a glass, determining the local distortions corresponding to these plastic events requires measurements before and after deformation. We investigate two geometric indicators that can be derived from these distortions, namely the continuous Burgers vector and the quadrupolar strain. We find that the Burgers vector again emerges as a robust and sensitive metric for understanding local structural transformations due to mechanical deformation, even in disordered glasses.

Title: Interplay of Unidirectional Quantum Strings in Kagome Rydberg Atom Array
Authors: Wei Xu, Xue-Feng Zhang
Abstract: Leveraging the rapid development of quantum simulators, the intriguing phenomena of quantum string are observed across various quantum simulation platforms. However, the complex interplay between the quantum strings cannot be well analyzed due to the limited system size in real quantum simulators. Here, with the help of a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo method, we can simulate a larger-scale Kagome Rydberg atom array, providing an ideal playground for studying quantum strings. By introducing a novel edge pinning method, the ends of a quantum string can be attached to edges so that the flexible manipulation of the quantum string becomes possible. Due to the geometric constraint, the quantum strings are unidirectional, which strongly complicates their interplay. To quantitatively describe the quantum string, we built a one-dimensional effective model. With both analytic and numerical methods, rich physics can be found, including ``geometric breaking", heart-like superposition state of quantum strings, and the attractive inter-string interactions. This work can benefit the comprehension of quantum strings and may also shed light on the simulation of high-energy physics.

Title: Revisiting the Ratchet Principle: When Hidden Symmetries Prevent Steady Currents
Authors: Jessica Metzger, Sunghan Ro, Julien Tailleur
Abstract: The "ratchet principle", which states that non-equilibrium systems violating parity symmetry generically exhibit steady-state currents, is one of the few generic results outside thermal equilibrium. We study exceptions to this principle observed in active and passive systems with spatially varying fluctuations sources. For dilute systems, we show that a hidden time-reversal symmetry prevents the emergence of ratchet currents. At higher densities, pairwise forces break this symmetry but an emergent conservation law for the momentum field may nevertheless prevent steady currents. We show how the presence of this conservation law can be tested analytically and characterize the onset of ratchet currents in its absence. Our results show that the ratchet principle should be amended to preclude parity symmetry, time-reversal symmetry, and bulk momentum conservation.

Title: A Cold Tracer in a Hot Bath: In and Out of Equilibrium
Authors: Amer Al-Hiyasat, Sunghan Ro, Julien Tailleur
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a zero-temperature overdamped tracer in a bath of Brownian particles. As the bath density is increased, numerical simulations show the tracer to transition from an active dynamics, characterized by boundary accumulation and ratchet currents, to an effective equilibrium regime. To account for this analytically, we eliminate the bath degrees of freedom under the assumption of linear coupling to the tracer and show convergence, in the large density limit, to an equilibrium dynamics at the bath temperature. We then develop a perturbation theory to characterize the tracer's departure from equilibrium at large but finite bath densities, revealing an intermediate time-reversible yet non-Boltzmann regime, followed by a fully irreversible one. Finally, we show that when the bath particles are connected as a lattice, mimicking a gel or a soft active solid, the cold tracer drives the entire bath out of equilibrium, leading to a long-ranged suppression of bath fluctuations.

Title: Spin-degenerate bulk bands and topological surface states associated with Dirac nodal lines in RuO2

Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel platform to realize exotic electromagnetic properties distinct from those of conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We report results of micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on RuO2, in which its altermagnetic nature has been under fierce debate in connection with crystal-orientation-dependent spintronic functionalities. By elucidating the band structure of the (100), (110) and (101) surfaces of a bulk single crystal using micro-ARPES, we found that, irrespective of the surface orientation, the experimental band structures show a good agreement with the bulk-band calculations for the nonmagnetic phase, but display a severe disagreement with those for the antiferromagnetic phase. Moreover, spin-resolved ARPES signifies a negligible spin polarization in the bulk bands, suggesting the absence of antiferromagnetism and altermagnetic spin splitting. In addition, we identified a nearly flat surface band and a dispersive one near the Fermi level at the (100)/(110) and (101) surfaces, respectively. Our first-principles calculations and analysis of Berry phase attribute these states to the topological surface bands emerging from the bulk Dirac nodal lines around the Fermi level. Our results indicate that such topological surface/interface states must be considered to understand the spintronic functionalities of RuO2, and may provide new insights into its catalytic characteristics.

Title: Measurement of the Casimir force between superconductors
Authors: Matthijs H. J. de Jong, Evren Korkmazgil, Louise Banniard, Mika A. Sillanpää, Laure Mercier de Lépinay
Abstract: The Casimir force follows from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and yields a nonlinear attractive force between closely spaced conductive objects. Its magnitude depends on the conductivity of the objects up to optical frequencies. Measuring the Casimir force in superconductors should allow to isolate frequency-specific contributions to the Casimir effect, as frequencies below the superconducting gap energy are expected to contribute differently than those above it. There is significant interest in this contribution as it is suspected to contribute to an unexplained discrepancy between predictions and measurements of the Casimir force between normal metals, which questions the basic principles on which estimates of the magnitude are based. Here, we observe the Casimir force between superconducting objects through the nonlinear dynamics it imparts to a superconducting drum resonator in a microwave optomechanical system. There is excellent agreement between the experiment and the Casimir force magnitude computed for this device across three orders of magnitude of displacement. Furthermore, the Casimir nonlinearity is intense enough that, with a modified design, this device type should operate in the single-phonon nonlinear regime. Accessing this regime has been a long-standing goal that would greatly facilitate quantum operations of mechanical resonators.

Title: Limits of Information Flow Between Classically Interacting Particles
Authors: Miles Miller-Dickson, Christopher Rose
Abstract: Pinning down a precise understanding of information flow within physical interactions remains a central concern to fields like stochastic thermodynamics and quantum information science. In both spheres a careful accounting of bits (or qubits) enables a deeper understanding of the physical nature of information. In this work we propose a measure of information flow as a saddle-point solution of the mutual information. This approach places a lower bound on the channel capacity between a particle and an interacting environment. The measure is given by P/2E in nats/sec, with P the average power flux between the particle and its environment, and E the initial average energy of the particle, all computed in a frame where the particle has zero average momentum. We use a communication theory lens to suggest an associated channel analogy, in which this bound is interpreted as a signal-to-noise ratio. We find that this measure can also quantify early-time information flow for a particle interacting with a thermal bath.

Title: Generalized $η$-pairing theory and anomalous localization in quantum many-body non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Kai Lieta
Abstract: Describing and understanding the physical properties of quantum many-body non-Hermitian systems is a challenging task. In this work, we generalize the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices and find many novel phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be possible even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, for example, new types of eta-pairing operators (e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators) and the anomalous localization (e.g., the skin effect) of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we first propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. Then, we generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstates can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Finally, a general two-sublattice model is constructed to realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena. This work provides a new and rigorous theoretical framework for studying novel physical phenomena (e.g., the skin effect) in interacting non-Hermitian many-body systems, even in arbitrary spatial dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry.

Title: Universal whirling magnetic orders in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type quasicrystal approximants
Authors: Farid Labib, Kazuhiro Nawa, Yusuke Nambu, Hiroyuki Takakura, Yoichi Ikeda, Kazuhiko Deguchi, Masato Matsuura, Asuka Ishikawa, Ryoichi Kajimoto, Kazuhiko Ikeuchi, Taku J. Sato, Ryuji Tamura
Abstract: Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.

Title: Statistical mechanics of a cold tracer in a hot bath
Authors: Amer Al-Hiyasat, Sunghan Ro, Julien Tailleur
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a zero-temperature particle interacting linearly with a bath of hot Brownian particles. Starting with the most general model of a linearly-coupled bath, we eliminate the bath degrees of freedom exactly to map the tracer dynamics onto a generalized Langevin equation, allowing for an arbitrary external potential on the tracer. We apply this result to determine the fate of a tracer connected by springs to $N$ identical bath particles or inserted within a harmonic chain of hot particles. In the former "fully-connected" case, we find the tracer to transition between an effective equilibrium regime at large $N$ and an FDT-violating regime at finite $N$, while in the latter "loop" model the tracer never satisfies an FDT. We then study the fully-connected model perturbatively for large but finite $N$, demonstrating signatures of irreversibility such as ratchet currents, non-Boltzmann statistics, and positive entropy production. Finally, we specialize to harmonic external potentials on the tracer, allowing us to exactly solve the dynamics of both the tracer and the bath for an arbitrary linear model. We apply our findings to show that a cold tracer in a hot lattice suppresses the fluctuations of the lattice in a long-ranged manner, and we generalize this result to linear elastic field theories.

Title: Exceptions to the Ratchet Principle in active and passive stochastic dynamics
Authors: Jessica Metzger, Sunghan Ro, Julien Tailleur
Abstract: The "ratchet principle" asserts that non-equilibrium systems which violate parity symmetry generically exhibit steady-state currents. As recently shown, there are exceptions to this principle, due to the existence of hidden time-reversal symmetry or bulk momentum conservation. For underdamped and overdamped Brownian dynamics, we show how thermal fluctuations cannot power the momentum sources required to sustain steady ratchet currents, even when time-reversal symmetry is broken due to an inhomogeneous temperature field. While Active Brownian and Run-and-Tumble particles display interaction-induced ratchet currents in asymmetric activity landscapes, we show that this is not the case for Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles: not all inhomogeneous active fluctuations lead to net momentum sources. For each of the systems considered in this article, we numerically test for the emergence of interaction-induced ratchet currents. We then characterize time-reversal (a)symmetry in position space using a combination of path-integral and operator methods. When the existence of effective momentum conservation is ruled out, we develop perturbation theories to characterize the onset of interaction-induced currents.

Title: Designing semiconductor-electrochemical junctions for bioinspired energy transduction
Authors: Jonathon L. Yuly
Abstract: Long ago, life discovered how to efficiently push electrons thermodynamically uphill to lower potential by harnessing energy released by an equal number of electrons moving downhill. Known as electron bifurcation, this form of energy transduction has never been observed in the absence of natural enzymes. To successfully bifurcate electrons, a system must block short-circuit electron transfers that allow all electrons to flow downhill, while maintaining productive reactions. It is difficult to design systems that catalyze these highly-selective electron flows while minimizing free energy dissipation. Using theories of electron transfer and charge transport, I introduce semiconductor-electrolyte junctions that spontaneously bifurcate electrons analogously to natural enzymes (bifurcating junctions). I simulate a simple but illustrative bifurcating junction with typical material properties, and discuss how more complicated designs could achieve higher performance.

Title: Emulation of quantum correlations by classical dynamics in a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain
Authors: Chaebin Kim, Martin Mourigal
Abstract: We simulate the dynamical spin structure factor (DSSF) $\mathcal{S}({q},\omega)$ of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain using classical simulations. By employing Landau-Lifshitz Dynamics, we emulate quantum correlations through temperature-dependent corrections, including rescaling of magnetic dipoles and renormalization of exchange interactions. Our results closely match Quantum Monte-Carlo calculations for $k_{\rm B}T/J\!\gtrsim\!1$, extending the applicability of classical dynamics to the challenging case of gapless excitations. At higher temperatures, our simulations comply with general predictions for uncorrelated paramagnetic fluctuations in the infinite temperature limit. Entanglement witnesses derived from the quantum-equivalent DSSF act as sensitive diagnostics for the quantum-to-classical crossover. Their reliability stems from their dependence on spectral features alone, enabling classical dynamics to emulate quantum thresholds without genuine entanglement. This framework also reproduces transverse spin correlations in finite magnetic fields, in agreement with quantum simulations. Together, our results establish quantum-corrected classical dynamics as a scalable and predictive tool for interpreting scattering experiments and exploring quantum correlations in strongly correlated spin systems.

Title: Quantifying the Phase Diagram and Hamiltonian of $S=1/2$ Kagome Antiferromagnets: Bridging Theory and Experiment
Authors: Shengtao Jiang, Arthur C. Campello, Wei He, Jiajia Wen, Daniel M. Pajerowski, Young S. Lee, Hong-Chen Jiang
Abstract: Spin-$1/2$ kagome antiferromagnets are leading candidates for realizing quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground states. While QSL ground states are predicted for the pure Heisenberg model, understanding the robustness of the QSL to additional interactions that may be present in real materials is a forefront question in the field. Here we employ large-scale density-matrix renormalization group simulations to investigate the effects of next-nearest neighbor exchange couplings $J_2$ and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions $D$, which are relevant to understanding the prototypical kagome materials herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite. By utilizing clusters as large as XC12 and extrapolating the results to the thermodynamic limit, we precisely delineate the scope of the QSL phase, which remains robust across an expanded parameter range of $J_2$ and $D$. Direct comparison of the simulated static and dynamic spin structure factors with inelastic neutron scattering reveals the parameter space of the Hamiltonians for herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite, and, importantly, provides compelling evidence that both materials exist within the QSL phase. These results establish a powerful convergence of theory and experiment in this most elusive state of matter.

Title: Charge order-driven nematicity in the nickel-pnictide superconductor Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$As$_2$
Authors: Thomas Johnson, Camille Bernal-Choban, Sangjun Lee, Xuefei Guo, Stella Sun, John Collini, Christopher Eckberg, Johnpierre Paglione, Rafael M. Fernandes, Eduardo Fradkin, Peter Abbamonte
Abstract: Nematic order refers to the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry while preserving translational symmetry. First identified in classical liquid crystals, nematic order arises from the collective alignment of anisotropic molecules. Its quantum counterpart, electronic nematicity, has been observed in a variety of quantum materials, ranging from unconventional superconductors to kagome metals. Despite its prevalence, there is no universal understanding of the conditions under which nematic order occurs. Electronic nematicity is most firmly established in iron-based superconductors, where it is understood to be a consequence of vestigial spin density wave (SDW) order. However, direct evidence for nematicity arising from other types of order are lacking. Here, we report direct evidence for charge-order-driven electronic nematicity in Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$As$_2$, a nickel-based analog of the iron pnictides known to exhibit charge density wave (CDW) order. Using x-ray diffraction under applied uniaxial strain, we observe a pronounced symmetry-breaking response-up to $\sim 50 \%$-in the intensity of incommensurate CDW Bragg peaks, even at small strain levels ($\epsilon_{xy} \sim 10^{-3}$). This effect occurs within the same region of the phase diagram where a giant nematic susceptibility is observed in transport measurements. These results provide direct evidence that long-range CDW order can drive nematic behavior in quantum materials.

Title: Two-dimensional flat band on the (011) surface of UTe$_2$: Implication for STM measurements with a superconducting tip
Authors: Jushin Tei, Takeshi Mizushima, Satoshi Fujimoto
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements have been extensively performed on the easily cleavable (011) surface of UTe$_2$, using both normal-metal and superconducting tips. Motivated by these experiments, we theoretically investigate the topological surface states on the (011) surface of UTe$_2$. We find that a two-dimensional nearly flat band emerges in the $B_{3u}$ state, giving rise to a pronounced zero-energy peak in the surface density of states. This flat band is supported by two key mechanisms: (i)~nontrivial Berry phases defined at multiple momenta give rise to low-energy in-gap states, and (ii)~weak spin conservation allows the gap function to acquire phase winding. Furthermore, to investigate the relation between the zero-bias peak observed in recent STM experiments with a superconducting tip and the topological surface states, we calculate the nonequilibrium dc tunneling current in a junction between an $s$-wave superconductor and the (011) surface of UTe$_2$. Our results provide crucial insights into the superconducting pairing symmetry realized in UTe$_2$.

Title: Enhanced reversible barocaloric effect at low pressure in neopentyl plastic crystal solid solutions
Authors: Frederic Rendell-Bhatti, Melony Dilshad, Celine Beck, Markus Appel, Alba Prats, Eamonn T. Connolly, Claire Wilson, Lewis Giannelli, Pol Lloveras, Xavier Moya, David Boldrin, Donald A. MacLaren
Abstract: The discovery of colossal barocaloric effects in neopentyl glycol (NPG) makes plastic crystals promising candidates for solid-state refrigerants with lower environmental impact than vapour compression fluids. Optimising operational temperatures and low-pressure operability remains challenging without compromising thermodynamic parameters. Here, we implement a strategy to improve the viability of NPG derivatives as barocaloric refrigerants. We blend pentaglycerine (PG) with NPG to lower the phase transition temperature, then dope the blend with 2% pentaerythritol (PE) to improve transition reversibility. In comparison with NPG under the same conditions, this ternary system has a seven-fold increase in reversible isothermal entropy change (|$\Delta S_{(it,rev)}$ | = 13.4 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$) and twenty-fold increase in operational temperature span ($\Delta T_{span}$ = 18 K) at pressures of 1 kbar. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction and quasielastic neutron scattering reveal structural and dynamical effects that broaden the temperature range of the first-order phase transition due to intermolecular hydrogen bond network disruption by the molecular dopants. We propose that exploiting the compositional phase space of multi-component molecular blends is effective for designing practicable molecular BCs.

Title: Shot noise in strongly correlated double quantum spin Hall edges
Authors: Andreas Tsantilas, Trithep Devakul, Julian May-Mann
Abstract: We consider the effects of interactions on the edges of ``double" quantum spin Hall insulators (DQSHIs), motivated by recent experiments on moiré twisted metal dichalcogenides. Without interactions, a DQSHI can be understood as two copies of a conventional quantum spin Hall insulator. If interactions are present and $s^z$-spin is conserved, we show that there are two possible phases for the DQSHI edge. First is a weakly correlated edge which has two pairs of helical modes and is adiabatically equivalent to two conventional quantum spin Hall edges. Second is a strongly correlated edge with only one pair of helical modes. The strongly correlated edge also has a gap to single electrons, but is gapless to pairs of electrons. In a quantum point contact geometry, this single-electron gap leads to a Fano factor of $2$ in shot noise measurements, compared to a Fano factor of $1$ for a weakly correlated edge.

Title: Impurity dynamics in a zero-temperature gas
Authors: Umesh Kumar, Abhishek Dhar, P. L. Krapivsky
Abstract: If energy is suddenly released in a localized region of space uniformly filled with identical stationary hard spheres, the outcome is a blast with an asymptotically spherical shock wave separating moving and stationary hard spheres. The radius $R(t)$ of the region filled with the moving spheres grows as $t^{2/(d+2)}$, where $d$ is the spatial dimension. The simplest way to inject energy is to kick a few `impurity' particles. Using hydrodynamics and kinetic theory, we argue that the typical displacement of an impurity scales as $R_{\rm imp} \sim \lambda (R/\lambda)^{(4+3d^2)/(8+3d^2)}$, where $\lambda$ is the mean-free path in the initial state. The number of collisions experienced by each impurity grows as $(R/\lambda)^{(8+2d^2)/(8+3d^2)}$, while its average speed decreases as $t^{-d(8-2d+3d^2)/[(2+d)(8+3d^2)]}$. In $2D$, the predictions for impurity displacement, collision numbers, and speed are $t^{2/5},~t^{2/5}$ and $t^{-2/5}$, respectively. These predictions are in reasonable agreement with the results of molecular dynamics simulations.

Title: Beyond the Electric Dipole Approximation: Electric and Magnetic Multipole Contributions Reveal Biaxial Water Structure from SFG Spectra at the Air-Water Interface
Authors: Louis Lehmann, Maximilian R. Becker, Lucas Tepper, Alexander P. Fellows, Álvaro Díaz Duque, Martin Thämer, Roland R. Netz
Abstract: The interpretation of sum-frequency-generation (SFG) spectra has been severely limited by the absence of quantitative theoretical predictions of higher-order multipole contributions. Magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contributions are determined by bulk properties but appear in all experimental SFG spectra, obscuring the connection between measured spectra and interfacial structure. We present the simulation-based framework to predict the full set of multipole spectral contributions. This framework also yields depth-resolved spectra, enabling the precise spatial localization of spectroscopic features. Applied to the air-water interface, our approach achieves quantitative agreement with experimental spectra for different polarization combinations in both the bending and stretching regions. Higher-order multipole contributions are crucial for correctly interpreting SFG spectra: in the bending band, the electric dipole and the magnetic dipole contributions have similar intensities, while the electric quadrupole contribution is significantly larger. In the OH-stretch region, the electric quadrupole contribution is found to be in large part responsible for the characteristic shoulder at 3600/cm. Crucially, subtracting the quadrupole and magnetic contributions isolates the second-order electric dipole susceptibility, which is a quantitative probe for interfacial molecular orientational anisotropy. This electric-dipole susceptibility reveals a pronounced biaxial ordering of water at the air-water interface. By resolving a fundamental limitation of the interpretation of SFG spectroscopy, our framework allows for the detailed extraction of interfacial water ordering from SFG spectra.

Title: Spin-Chain Multichannel Kondo Model via Image Impurity Boundary Condition
Authors: Jordan Gaines, Guangjie Li, Jukka Väyrynen
Abstract: One of the signature observables for the electronic multichannel Kondo model is the impurity entropy, which was found in $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chains with the open boundary condition (OBC) and periodic boundary condition (PBC), for the one-channel and two-channel cases respectively. However, it is not clear how to generalize OBC and PBC in Heisenberg chains to find the multichannel Kondo impurity entropy with more than two channels. In this paper, we demonstrate that the correct boundary condition for realizing multichannel Kondo physics in Heisenberg chains is the image impurity boundary condition (IIBC) which preserves reflection symmetry and yields the expected impurity entropy, $\ln[(\sqrt{5}+1)/2]$ for the three-channel case and $\ln\sqrt{3}$ for the four-channel case. Moreover, the IIBC reduces to OBC for the one-channel case and to PBC for the two-channel case. With IIBC, the finite-size scaling of the impurity entropy and the total impurity spin match the finite-temperature corrections in the electronic multichannel Kondo model. Additionally, we show dependence of the impurity entropy, the total impurity spin, and their scaling behaviors on the XXZ anisotropy $\Delta$ (equivalently the Luttinger liquid parameter), revealing impurity physics in a multichannel Luttinger liquid.

Title: Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state

Abstract: Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials, the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover small amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.

Title: Data-Driven Review and Machine Learning Prediction of Diamond Vacancy Center Synthesis
Authors: Zhi Jiang, Marco Peres, Carlo Bradac, Gil Gonçalves
Abstract: Diamond and diamond color centers have become prime hardware candidates for solid state-based technologies in quantum information and computing, optics, photonics and (bio)sensing. The synthesis of diamond materials with specific characteristics and the precise control of the hosted color centers is thus essential to meet the demands of advanced applications. Yet, challenges remain in improving the concentration, uniform distribution and quality of these centers. Here, we perform a review and meta-analysis of some of the main diamond synthesis methods and their parameters for the synthesis of N-, Si-, Ge- and Sn-vacancy color-centers. We extract quantitative data from over 60 experimental papers and organize it in a large database (170 data sets and 1692 entries). We then use the database to train two machine learning algorithms to make robust predictions about the fabrication of diamond materials with specific properties from careful combinations of synthesis parameters. We use traditional statistical indicators to benchmark the performance of the algorithms and show that they are powerful and resource-efficient tools for researchers and material scientists working with diamond color centers and their applications.

Title: Pressure and doping control of magnetic order and metallization in Ruddlesden-Popper La2NiO4
Authors: Han-Yu Wang, Shu-Hong Tang, Xiao-Teng Huang, Ya-Min Quan, XianLong Wang, Yan-Ling Li, Da-Yong Liu, H.-Q. Lin, Zhi Zeng, Liang-Jian Zou
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in multilayer nickelates under pressure has intensified interest in understanding the magnetic and electronic properties of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates. Using density functional theory with Hubbard corrections, we investigate the magnetic ground state, electronic structure evolution under pressure, and Sr-doping effects in La$_2$NiO$_4$. We find that at ambient pressure, tetragonal La$_2$NiO$_4$ exhibits G-type antiferromagnetic order with negligible interlayer magnetic coupling. Under hydrostatic pressure, the system undergoes a continuous insulator-metal transition at ~50 GPa while maintaining robust magnetic order up to 75 GPa, contrasting sharply with the rapid magnetic suppression in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Sr doping induces a systematic evolution from G-type to A-type, to striped antiferromagnetic orders, and eventually to ferromagnetic order, accompanied by metallization. Furthermore, LaSrNiO$_4$ displays weak charge and orbital orders. These results reveal the unique pressure and doping effects of single-layer nickelates and provide insights into the magnetic mechanisms underlying nickelate superconductivity.

Abstract: We report on all-optical generation and detection of high-frequency (up to about 30 GHz) surface acoustic waves (SAWs) in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures with short-period Au gratings on top. A highly sensitive method for SAW detection is demonstrated using a polarization-resolved pump-probe technique that exploits the narrow exciton resonance in high-quality GaAs. The elastic strain of the SAW modulates the exciton energy in the time domain. As a result, even a small deformation produces a noticeable change in the dielectric function at the detection wavelength leading to an order of magnitude increase in the detection sensitivity as compared to off-resonant conditions. A theoretical model is developed that considers two detection schemes: one accounting for probe light diffraction and one corresponding to a non-diffractive situation.

Title: Dislocation-Driven Nucleation Type Switching Across Repeated Ultrafast Magnetostructural Phase Transition
Authors: Jan Hajduček, Antoine Andrieux, Jon Ander Arregi, Martin Tichý, Paolo Cattaneo, Beatrice Ferrari, Fabrizio Carbone, Vojtěch Uhlíř, Thomas LaGrange
Abstract: Controlling magnetic order on ultrafast timescales, driven by spintronic and recording applications, is one of the main directions of current research in magnetism. Despite major advances in understanding the temporal evolution of magnetic order upon its emergence or quenching, experimental demonstration of the local link between microstructure and dynamic nucleation is missing. Here, taking advantage of the high structural and magnetic resolution of in situ transmission electron microscopy, we observe that cumulative laser irradiation significantly alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition of FeRh thin films, causing the transition to switch from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation. This leads to a decrease of 20 K in transition temperature and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices as preferential nucleation motifs. These vortices are pinned in the film by underlying dislocation networks. We observe that the dislocation networks are formed and rearranged upon repeated crossing of the phase transition using femtosecond and picosecond laser pulses. Our results establish a direct link between defect formation, nucleation energetics, and the microscopic morphology of the nucleated ferromagnetic phase, with broad implications for ultrafast stroboscopic experiments and defect-mediated phase transitions in functional materials.

Title: Spin-resolved quasiparticle interference patterns on altermagnets via non-spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy
Authors: Eric Petermann, Kristian Mæland, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: We investigate quasiparticle interference on an altermagnetic Lieb-like lattice and show how a non-spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy measurement can yield effectively spin-resolved information. Within a four-site tight-binding model, which can be tuned between an antiferromagnetic and a Lieb-type altermagnetic state, we introduce on-site impurities at distinct sublattice sites and compute the real space local density of states (LDOS) via a Green's function approach. A Fourier transformation of the impurity-induced LDOS yields the characteristic $d$-wave spin-split Fermi surface contours of the altermagnetic phase. Notably, by choosing which sublattice the impurity is placed upon, we show that the scattering amplitudes effectively encode spin-dependent contrasts: Impurities on one of the magnetic sublattices highlights predominantly spin-up contributions along one crystallographic direction, while impurities on the other one favor the complementary spin-down channel and orientation.

Title: Topological Defect Formation Beyond the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism in Crossover Transitions with Approximate Symmetries
Authors: Peng Yang, Chuan-Yin Xia, Sebastian Grieninger, Hua-Bi Zeng, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: The formation of topological defects during continuous second-order phase transitions is well described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). However, when the spontaneously broken symmetry is only approximate, such transitions become smooth crossovers, and the applicability of KZM in these scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing both a weakly coupled Ginzburg-Landau model and a strongly coupled holographic setup, each featuring pseudo-spontaneous breaking of a global U(1) symmetry. In the slow quench regime, we observe a breakdown of the universal power-law scaling predicted by the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism. Specifically, the defect density acquires an exponential correction dependent on the quench rate, following a universal form dictated by the source of explicit symmetry breaking. Although these dynamics extend beyond the scope of the traditional KZM, we demonstrate that a generalized framework, that incorporates the effects of explicit symmetry breaking into the dynamical correlation length, remains valid and accurately captures the non-equilibrium defect formation across the entire range of quench rates.

Title: About carrier's self-trapping and dynamical Rashba splitting in the two-dimensional hybrid perovskite (BA)$_2$(MA)$_2$Pb$_3$I$_{10}$

Abstract: Time- and Angle-Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) is employed to monitor photoexcited electrons in the two-dimensional hybrid perovskite (BA)$_2$(MA)$_2$Pb$_3$I$_{10}$. Photoelectron intensity maps are in good agreement with ab-initio calculations of the band structure. The effective mass is $-0.18 \pm 0.02 m_e$ and $0.12 \pm 0.02 m_e$ for holes and electrons, respectively. In the photoexcited state, spin-orbit splitting of the conduction band cannot be resolved. This sets the upper bound of photoinduced Rashba coupling to $\alpha_C<2.5$ eVÅ. The correlated electron-hole plasma evolves in Wannier excitons with Bohr radius of 2.8 nm, while no sign of self-trapping in small polarons is found within the investigated time window of up to 120 ps following photoexcitation.

Title: Linear approximations of large deviations: Cubic diffusion test
Authors: Pelerine Tsobgni Nyawo, Hugo Touchette
Abstract: We propose a method for approximating the large deviation rate function of time-integrated observables of diffusion processes, used in statistical physics to characterize the fluctuations of nonequilibrium systems. The method is based on linearizing the effective process associated with the large deviations of the process and observable considered, and is tested for a simple one-dimensional nonlinear diffusion model involving a cubic drift. The results show that the linear approximation compares well with the exact rate function, especially in the large fluctuation regime, and that its accuracy is related to the way the linearized process localizes in space. Possible extensions and applications to more complex diffusion models are proposed for future work.

Title: Optical Voltammetry of redox processes inside a nanohole with opto-iontronic microscopy
Authors: Zhu Zhang, Haolan Tao, Cheng Lian, René van Roij, Sanli Faez
Abstract: Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) is the most commonly used method in electrochemistry to characterize electrochemical reactions, usually involving macroscopic electrodes. Here we demonstrate an optical CV technique called Opto-iontronic Microscopy, which is capable of monitoring electrochemical processes at the nanoscale. By integrating optical microscopy with nanohole electrodes, we enhance sensitivity in detecting redox reactions within volumes as small as an attoliter ($(100 \text{~nm})^{3}$). This technique uses total internal reflection illumination, Electric-double-layer modulation, cyclic voltammetry, and lock-in detection, to probe ion dynamics inside nanoholes. We applied this method to study EDL (dis)charging coupled to ferrocenedimethanol (Fc(MeOH)$_2$) redox reactions. Experimental results were validated against a theoretical Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Butler-Volmer model, providing insights into ion concentration changes of reaction species that contribute to the optical contrast. This work opens up opportunities for high-sensitivity, label-free analysis of electrochemical reactions in nanoconfined environments, with potential applications in pure nanocrystal growth and monitoring.

Title: Coordinate space representation of a one-dimensional odd-parity pseudopotential
Authors: Marc Camus-Sais, Abel Rojo-Francàs, Grigori E. Astrakharchik, Bruno Juliá-Díaz
Abstract: We propose a discrete-space representation of a one-dimensional zero-range odd-parity pseudopotential. The proposed representation is validated by applying it to the analytically solvable case of two fermions in a harmonic trap and successfully recovering the exact energy spectrum and eigenfunctions. Furthermore, we use the square-well and modified Pöschl--Teller potentials as finite-range representations of the odd-parity interaction and study their convergence to the contact interaction when the range tends to zero. Finally, we perform natural orbital analysis and compute the eigenvalues of the one-body density matrix for different particle numbers, examining their dependence on the one-dimensional scattering length and identifying distinct physical regimes.

Title: Current-induced molecular dissociation: Topological insulators as robust reaction platforms
Authors: Erika L. Mehring, Amparo Figueroa, Matias Berdakin, Hernán L. Calvo
Abstract: The growing interest in topological materials with symmetry-protected surface states as catalytic platforms has sparked the emerging field of topocatalysis. As robust transport is one of the key features of topological insulators, here we explore current-induced molecular dissociation in a transport setup. Using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we compare how the occupancies of bonding and antibonding levels, as well as the associated electronic forces in a diatomic molecule, are affected when the molecule is coupled to either a metallic (graphene) or a topological (Kane-Mele) substrate. We find a greater dissociative capability in the topological substrate than in graphene, a difference mainly attributed to the localized nature of the edge states. The inclusion of vacancy disorder within the substrate further enhances this disparity in the dissociative force. Our findings highlight the role of topological protection in molecular dissociation under non-equilibrium conditions, pointing to new opportunities for robust catalysis in topological materials.

Title: Euler band topology in superfluids and superconductors
Authors: Shingo Kobayashi, Manabu Sato, Akira Furusaki
Abstract: Real band topology often appears in systems with space-time inversion symmetry and is characterized by invariants such as the Euler and second Stiefel-Whitney classes. Here, we examine the generic band topology of Bogoliubov de-Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians with $C_{2z}T$ symmetry, where $C_{2z}$ and $T$ are twofold rotation about the $z$ axis and time-reversal symmetries, respectively. We discuss the Euler band topology of superfluids and superconductors in the DIII and CI Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, where the Euler class serves as an integer-valued topological invariant of the $4\times4$ BdG Hamiltonian. Using expressions for the Euler class under $n$-fold rotational symmetry, we derive formulas relating the Euler class to previously known topological invariants of class DIII and CI systems. We demonstrate that three-dimensional class DIII topological phases with an odd winding number, including the B phase of superfluid Helium 3, are topological superconductors or superfluids with a nontrivial Euler class. We refer to these as Euler superconductors or superfluids. Specifically, the $^3$He-B superfluid in a magnetic field is identified as an Euler superfluid. Three-dimensional class CI topological phases with twice an odd winding number are also Euler superconductors or superfluids. When spatial inversion symmetry is present, class CI superconductors with a nontrivial Euler class exhibit superconducting nodal lines with a linking structure. This phenomenon is demonstrated using a model of a three-dimensional $s_\pm$-wave superconductor. These findings provide a unified framework for exploring Euler band topology in superfluids and superconductors, connecting various phenomena associated with $T$-breaking perturbations, including Majorana Ising susceptibility and higher-order topology.

Title: Data-Driven Stochastic Modeling of Schooling Fish: From Collective Dynamics to Individual Fluctuations
Authors: Elena G. de Lamo, M. Carmen Miguel, Romualdo Pastor-Satorras
Abstract: Collective motion in animal groups emerges from the interplay between individual variability and social coordination, yet connecting these scales quantitatively has remained a major this http URL high-resolution trajectories of schooling fish, we infer a data-driven stochastic framework that reproduces with remarkable accuracy the behavior of real fish schools. We decompose motion into two coupled components: the dynamics of the school's center of mass (or centroid), modeled as an active Brownian particle confined by the tank, and individual motions relative to that center, described by stochastic equations with data-inferred mean-field potentials and multiplicative noise. Simulations of these equations produce synthetic schools that quantitatively match real ones across multiple observables, including burst-and-coast dynamics, polarization, and spatial cohesion. This minimal, predictive framework bridges experiment and theory, showing that the collective dynamics of animal groups can be faithfully reconstructed from first principles directly from data.

Title: Bosonic realization of SU(3) chiral Haldane phases
Authors: Linpu Zhang, Junjun Xu
Abstract: We give a bosonic realization of the SU(3) antiferromagnetic Heisenberg (AFH) chain in the alternating conjugate representation, and study its phase diagram as a function of staggered interactions and anisotropy along the $T^3$ and $T^8$ directions. Unlike the SU(2) case, we observe a chiral-reversed quantum phase transition, where each competing phase is adiabatically connected to one of the chiral Haldane phases predicted in the SU(3) AFH chain with local adjoint representation. In the vicinity of the Heisenberg point, we identify a symmetry-protected topological state that appears at the first excited energy level. We also study the spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry breaking of the system, and provide a variational wavefunction that captures the transition from the topological phase to the trivial phase. Finally, we propose an experimental realization of our bosonic model by two spin-1/2 bosons in an optical lattice.

Title: Bond percolation in distorted square and triangular lattices
Authors: Bishnu Bhowmik, Sayantan Mitra, Robert M. Ziff, Ankur Sensharma
Abstract: This article presents a Monte Carlo study on bond percolation in distorted square and triangular lattices. The distorted lattices are generated by dislocating the sites from their regular positions. The amount and direction of the dislocations are random, but can be tuned by the distortion parameter $\alpha$. Once the sites are dislocated, the bond lengths $\delta$ between the nearest neighbors change. A bond can only be occupied if its bond length is less than a threshold value called the connection threshold $d$. It is observed that when the connection threshold is greater than the lattice constant (assumed to be $1$), the bond percolation threshold $p_\mathrm{b}$ always increases with distortion. For $d\le 1$, no spanning configuration is found for the square lattice when the lattice is distorted, even very slightly. On the other hand, the triangular lattice not only spans for $d\le 1$, it also shows a decreasing trend for $p_\mathrm{b}$ in the low-$\alpha$ range. These variation patterns have been linked with the average coordination numbers of the distorted lattices. A critical value $d_\mathrm{c}$ for the connection threshold has been defined as the value of $d$ below which no spanning configuration can be found even after occupying all the bonds satisfying the connection criterion $\delta\le d$. The behavior of $d_\mathrm{c}(\alpha)$ is markedly different for the two lattices.

Title: Measuring pulse heating in Si quantum dots with individual two-level fluctuators
Authors: Feiyang Ye, Lokendra S. Dhami, John M. Nichol
Abstract: To encode quantum information in semiconductor spin qubits, voltage pulses are necessary for initialization, gate operation, and readout. However, these pulses dissipate heat, shifting spin-qubit frequencies and reducing gate fidelities. The cause of this pulse heating in quantum-dot devices is unknown. Here, we measure pulse heating using charged two-level fluctuators (TLFs) in Si/SiGe quantum dots. Specifically, we observe that voltage pulses on nearby gates tend to increase TLF switching rates and occupation biases. The amount of heating depends on the pulse amplitude and frequency, but not on the distance between the pulsed gates and the TLFs. The amount of heating also generally depends on the idling voltage of the pulsed gates, suggesting that electrons accumulated under or near the gates contribute to the heating. We hypothesize that reducing the area of the gates with electrons nearby could mitigate the heating.

Title: Néel vector and Rashba SOC effects on RKKY interaction in 2D $d$-wave altermagnets
Authors: Hou-Jian Duan, Miao-Sheng Fang, Ming-Xun Deng, Ruiqiang Wang
Abstract: Altermagnets possess two key features: non-relativistic alternating spin splitting (i.e., altermagnetism) and a material-dependent Néel vector. The former naturally coexists with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in real materials on substrates, prompting the question of how SOC affects the magnetic properties of altermagnets. The latter is crucial for information storage, making it essential to determine its orientation. To address these issues, we study the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in two-dimensional (2D) $d$-wave altermagnets by independently varying the Néel vector orientation and the SOC strength. Our results demonstrate that the Néel vector orientation can be accurately determined via the Ising term without SOC, or qualitatively inferred via the DM terms with SOC. Moreover, we observe a novel Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) component distinct from previous reports, whose emergence is attributed to the synergy between altermagnetism and SOC. Additionally, through tuning SOC strength, we reveal the evolution of the RKKY spin models governed by five distinct mechanisms: the spin model may be determined solely by altermagnetism, solely by SOC, or solely by the kinetic term; alternatively, altermagnetism may coincidentally yield the same moderately anisotropic spin model as SOC, or compete with SOC to produce a spin model with maximal anisotropy. Beyond SOC strength, which mechanism operates also relies on the Néel vector orientation and impurity configurations. All results are numerically verified. These findings -- which were inaccessible in prior studies due to the limitations of first-order SOC expansion and fixed Néel vector orientation -- provide important new insights into the magnetic properties of altermagnets.

Title: Investigating Anharmonicities in Polarization-Orientation Raman Spectra of Acene Crystals with Machine Learning
Authors: Paolo Lazzaroni, Shubham Sharma, Mariana Rossi
Abstract: We present a first-principles machine-learning computational framework to investigate anharmonic effects in polarization-orientation (PO) Raman spectra of molecular crystals, focusing on anthracene and naphthalene. By combining machine learning models for interatomic potentials and polarizability tensors, we enable efficient, large-scale simulations that capture temperature-dependent vibrational dynamics beyond the harmonic approximation. Our approach reproduces key qualitative features observed experimentally. We show, systematically, what are the fingerprints of anharmonic lattice dynamics, thermal expansion, and Raman tensor symmetries on PO-Raman intensities. However, we find that the simulated polarization dependence of Raman intensities shows only subtle deviations from quasi-harmonic predictions, failing to capture the pronounced temperature-dependent changes that have been reported experimentally in anthracene. We propose that part of these inconsistencies stem from the impossibility to deconvolute certain vibrational peaks when only experimental data is available. This work therefore provides a foundation to improve the interpretation of PO-Raman experiments in complex molecular crystals with the aid of theoretical simulations.

Title: Variational optimization of projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice
Authors: Jan Naumann, Jens Eisert, Philipp Schmoll
Abstract: We introduce a general corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm tailored to projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice. By integrating automatic differentiation, our approach enables direct variational energy minimization on this lattice geometry. In contrast to conventional approaches that map the triangular lattice onto a square lattice with diagonal next-nearest-neighbour interactions, our native formulation yields improved variational results at the same bond dimension. This improvement stems from a more faithful and physically informed representation of the entanglement structure in the tensor network and an increased number of variational parameters. We apply our method to the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour Heisenberg model on the triangular and kagome lattice, and benchmark our results against previous numerical studies.

Title: Spin-spiral instability of the Nagaoka ferromagnet in the crossover between square and triangular lattices
Authors: Darren Pereira, Erich J. Mueller
Abstract: We study the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model in the crossover between square and triangular lattices near half-filling. As was recognized by Nagaoka in the 1960s, on the square lattice the presence of a single hole leads to ferromagnetic spin ordering. On the triangular lattice, geometric frustration instead leads to a spin-singlet ground state, which can be associated with a 120-degree spiral order. On lattices which interpolate between square and triangular, there is a phase transition at which the ferromagnetic order becomes unstable to a spin spiral. We model this transition, finding the exact location of the spin-spiral instability.

Title: Nonequilibrium DC Current Generation in a Driven Dissipative Haldane Model
Authors: Konrad Koenigsmann, Sankha Subhra Bakshi, Peter Schauss, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: The interplay of topology with nonequilibrium driving and dissipation in open quantum systems has recently attracted significant interest in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate a driven, dissipative Haldane model using large-scale numerical simulations of Lindblad dynamics. We show that the system evolves into a time-periodic quasi-steady state when subjected to driving and dissipation, with the ground-state topological invariant, the Chern number, no longer being quantized. Nevertheless, remnants of the underlying band topology persist in this state. To quantify this regime, we introduce an occupation-weighted Chern number that captures the topology of this nonequilibrium steady state. We further analyze charge transport in the presence of simultaneous driving and damping and demonstrate that a finite DC bulk current emerges when inversion symmetry is broken by a staggered sublattice potential. The magnitude and direction of this current are controlled by the driving amplitude, revealing a tunable nonequilibrium transport response rooted in broken symmetries and residual topology.

Title: Dislocation-point defect interaction on plasticity across the length scale in SrTiO3
Authors: Chukwudalu Okafor, Kohei Takahara, Svetlana Korneychuk, Isabel Huck, Sebastian Bruns, Ruoqi Li, Yan Li, Karsten Durst, Atsutomo Nakamura, Xufei Fang
Abstract: Point defect engineering is widely used to tailor the electronic and transport properties of complex oxides, yet its influence on dislocation plasticity remains poorly understood. Here, we establish how donor (Nb) doping modifies dislocation nucleation, multiplication, and mobility in single-crystal SrTiO3 by bridging nano-, meso-, and macroscale deformation. Using a combinatorial approach involving nanoindentation, cyclic Brinell indentation, and bulk uniaxial compression, we show that 0.5 wt% Nb doping consistently suppresses room-temperature plasticity. Nanoindentation reveals increased pop-in stresses, increased lattice friction stress, and reduced creep rates, indicating inhibited dislocation nucleation and motion with Nb doping. Mesoscale Brinell indentation exhibits discrete, widely spaced slip traces reflecting more difficult dislocation multiplication. Bulk uniaxial compression confirms ~50% higher yield stress in Nb-doped (0.5 wt%) SrTiO3 samples. Comparison with Fe-doped SrTiO3 (equivalent doping concentration) isolates the role of defect chemistry: oxygen vacancies promote incipient plasticity, whereas Sr vacancies dominate in Nb-doped SrTiO3, strongly hindering dislocation motion. This length-scale bridging approach consistently reveals suppressed dislocation nucleation, multiplication, and motion in the 0.5 wt% Nb-doped samples. These insights underline the importance of dislocation-defect chemistry on the mechanical behavior of functional oxides.

Title: Instabilities of a Generalized Gross-Neveu Quantum Criticality
Authors: Jaewon Kim
Abstract: We study the instabilities to the conformal critical point of an exactly solvable family of Gross-Neveu models. Using conformal field theory techniques, we construct the zero-temperature phase diagram and identify the superconducting and charge neutral ordered phases that destabilize the critical point. Both instabilities appear only when the fermions are strongly renormalized, above a critical anomalous dimension. A higher fermion anomalous dimension also raises the critical degree of time-reversal-symmetry breaking required to suppress superconductivity, indicating that pairing becomes more robust with stronger renormalization.

Title: Trichome entanglement enhances damage tolerance in microstructured biocomposites
Authors: Israel Kellersztein, Mathieu Desgranges, Chiara Daraio
Abstract: Achieving damage tolerance in composite materials remains a central challenge in materials science. Conventional strategies often rely on filler incorporation or chemical modification, which can limit energy dissipation and constrain structural stability. Here, we leverage the unique morphology of Spirulina trichomes to investigate a reinforcement mechanism based on physical filament entanglement. By comparing helical trichomes with their morphologically straightened counterparts, we isolate filament geometry as the key parameter governing mechanical performance. Trichome-based suspensions exhibit enhanced viscoelastic response and a threefold increase in yield stress. When processed via extrusion-based 3D printing using hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) as a matrix, entangled trichomes yield a 290% improvement in bending strength and a 15-fold enhancement in work of fracture. Fracture surface analysis reveals a transition from interfacial debonding and pull-out (in filaments) to crack propagation through the entangled network, indicating structure-mediated toughening. These findings establish trichome entanglement as a scalable, physically driven mechanism for enhancing damage tolerance through microstructural architecture.

Title: Generalized Finite-time Optimal Control Framework in Stochastic Thermodynamics
Authors: Atul Tanaji Mohite, Heiko Rieger
Abstract: Optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics are a frontier for understanding the control and design of non-equilibrium systems, with broad practical applications in biology, chemistry, and nanoscale/mesoscale systems. Optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry have emerged as optimal control methodology, but they are based on slow-driving and close to equilibrium assumptions. An optimal control framework in stochastic thermodynamics for finite time driving is still elusive. Therefore, we solve in this paper an optimal control problem for changing the control parameters of a discrete-state far-from-equilibrium process from an initial to a final value in finite-time. Optimal driving protocols are derived that minimize the total finite-time dissipation cost for the driving process. Our framework reveals that discontinuous endpoint jumps are a generic, model-independent physical mechanism that minimizes the optimal driving entropy production, whose importance is further amplified for far-from-equilibrium systems. The thermodynamic and dynamic physical interpretation and understanding of discontinuous endpoint jumps is formulated. An exact mapping between the finite-time to slow driving optimal control formulation is elucidated, developing the state-of-the-art of optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry, which has been the current paradigm for studying optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics that relies on slow driving assumptions. Our framework opens up a plethora of applications to the thermodynamically efficient control of a far-from-equilibrium system in finite-time, which opens up a way to their efficient design principles.

Title: Partition function and magnetization of two-dimensional Ising models in non-zero magnetic field: A semi-empirical approach
Authors: M V Vismaya, M V Sangaranarayanan
Abstract: The partition functions of ferromagnetic Ising models of square lattices in a finite magnetic field is deduced using topological considerations within a heuristic graph-theoretical approach. These equations are derived separately for low and high temperature regimes while the exact solution of Onsager is obtained therefrom when the magnetic field is zero. The derived partition function equations here are almost similar to those given by Onsager, thus indicating a straight-forward protocol, even when the magnetic field is present. The spontaneous magnetization derived here using the Helmholtz free energy is identical with that arising from the exact solution. The partition functions lead to the known series expansions of the magnetization and zero-field susceptibility.

Title: Effects of electron-electron interaction and spin-orbit coupling on Andreev pair qubits in quantum dot Josephson junctions
Authors: Teodor Iličin, Rok Žitko
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting Anderson impurity model for interacting quantum dot Josephson junctions with spin-orbit coupling and a term accounting for tunnelling through higher-energy orbitals. These elements establish the conditions required for spin polarization in the absence of external magnetic field at finite superconducting phase bias. This Hamiltonian has been previously used to model the Andreev spin qubit, where quantum information is encoded in spinful odd-parity subgap states. Here we instead analyse the even-parity sector, i.e., the Andreev pair qubit based on Andreev bound states (ABS). The model is solved using the zero-bandwidth approximation and the numerical renormalization group, with further insight from variational calculations. Electron-electron interaction admixes single-occupancy Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) components into the ABS states, thereby strongly enhancing spin transitions in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The ABS states can thus become sensitive to local magnetic field fluctuations, which has implications for decoherence in Andreev pair qubits. For strong interaction $U$, especially in the cross-over region between the ABS and YSR regimes for $U \sim 2\Delta$, charge, spin, and inductive transitions can all become strong, offering avenues for spin control and quantum transduction.

Title: Universal and Experiment-calibrated Prediction of XANES through Crystal Graph Neural Network and Transfer Learning Strategy
Authors: Zichang Lin, Wenjie Chen, Yitao Lin, Xinxin Zhang, Yuegang Zhang
Abstract: Theoretical simulation is helpful for accurate interpretation of experimental X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra that contain rich atomic and electronic structure information of materials. However, current simulation methods are usually too complex to give the needed accuracy and timeliness when a large amount of data need to be analyzed, such as for in-situ characterization of battery materials. To address these problems, artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed for XANES prediction. However, instead of using experimental XANES data, the existing models are trained using simulated data, resulting in significant discrepancies between the predicted and experimental spectra. Also, the universality across different elements has not been well studied for such models. In this work, we firstly establish a crystal graph neural network, pre-trained on simulated XANES data covering 48 elements, to achieve universal XANES prediction with a low average relative square error of 0.020223; and then utilize transfer learning to calibrate the model using a small experimental XANES dataset. After calibration, the edge energy misalignment error of the predicted S, Ti and Fe K edge XANES is significantly reduced by about 80%. The method demonstrated in this work opens up a new way to achieve fast, universal, and experiment-calibrated XANES prediction.

Title: Learning About Learning: A Physics Path from Spin Glasses to Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Denis D. Caprioti, Matheus Haas, Constantino F. Vasconcelos, Mauricio Girardi-Schappo
Abstract: The Hopfield model, originally inspired by spin-glass physics, occupies a central place at the intersection of statistical mechanics, neural networks, and modern artificial intelligence. Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability -- from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems -- it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society.

Title: Unavoidable Canonical Nonlinearity Induced by Gaussian Measures Discretization
Authors: Koretaka Yuge
Abstract: When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map phi from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems. In addition, we confirm that this W2-KL equivalence admits a natural generalization beyond Gaussian families, provided that the transport cost is aligned with the Fisher metric of an underlying statistical submanifold and the discretization scale induces infinitesimal parameter variations.

Title: Squeezing light to get nonclassical work in quantum engines
Authors: A. Tejero, D. Manzano, P.I. Hurtado
Abstract: Light can be squeezed by reducing the quantum uncertainty of the electric field for some phases. We show how to use this purely quantum effect to extract net mechanical work from radiation pressure in a simple quantum photon engine. Along the way, we demonstrate that the standard definition of work in quantum systems does not capture the extractable mechanical work, as it does not reflect the energy leaked to these quantum degrees of freedom. We use these results to design an Otto engine able to produce mechanical work from squeezing baths, in the absence of a thermal gradient. Interestingly, while work extraction from squeezing generally improves for low temperatures, there exists a nontrivial squeezing-dependent temperature for which work production is maximal, demonstrating the complex interplay between thermal and squeezing effects.

Title: A Classifying Space for Phases of Matrix Product States
Authors: Daniel D. Spiegel, Marvin Qi, David T. Stephen, Michael Hermele, Markus J. Pflaum, Agnes Beaudry
Abstract: We construct a topological space $\mathcal{B}$ consisting of translation invariant injective matrix product states (MPS) of all physical and bond dimensions and show that it has the weak homotopy type $K(\mathbb{Z}, 2) \times K(\mathbb{Z}, 3)$. The implication is that the phase of a family of such states parametrized by a space $X$ is completely determined by two invariants: a class in $H^2(X; \mathbb{Z})$ corresponding to the Chern number per unit cell and a class in $H^3(X; \mathbb{Z})$, the so-called Kapustin-Spodyneiko (KS) number. The space $\mathcal{B}$ is defined as the quotient of a contractible space $\mathcal{E}$ of MPS tensors by an equivalence relation describing gauge transformations of the tensors. We prove that the projection map $p:\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ is a quasifibration, and this allows us to determine the weak homotopy type of $\mathcal{B}$. As an example, we review the Chern number pump-a family of MPS parametrized by $S^3$-and prove that it generates $\pi_3(\mathcal{B})$.

Title: General theory of slow non-Hermitian evolution
Authors: Parveen Kumar, Yuval Gefen, Kyrylo Snizhko
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems are widespread in both classical and quantum physics. The dynamics of such systems has recently become a focal point of research, showcasing surprising behaviors that include apparent violation of the adiabatic theorem and chiral topological conversion related to encircling exceptional points (EPs). These have both fundamental interest and potential practical applications. Yet the current literature features a number of apparently irreconcilable results. Here we develop a general theory for slow evolution of non-Hermitian systems and resolve these contradictions. We prove an analog of the adiabatic theorem for non-Hermitian systems and generalize it in the presence of uncontrolled environmental fluctuations (noise). The effect of noise turns out to be crucial due to inherent exponential instabilities present in non-Hermitian systems. Disproving common wisdom, the end state of the system is determined by the final Hamiltonian only, and is insensitive to other details of the evolution trajectory in parameter space. Our quantitative theory, leading to transparent physical intuition, is amenable to experimental tests. It provides efficient tools to predict the outcome of the system's evolution, avoiding the need to follow costly time-evolution simulations. Our approach may be useful for designing devices based on non-Hermitian physics and may stimulate analyses of classical and quantum non-Hermitian-Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as that of quantum Lindbladian and hybrid-Liouvillian systems.

Title: A Magnetic-like Model for Chemotactic Navigation in Ants
Authors: Rosa Flaquer-Galmés, Daniel Campos, Javier Cristín
Abstract: We propose a physical framework for ant navigation of chemical trails. For this, we use controlled experiments in which individuals follow narrow pheromone trails, for which ants display oscillatory motion, as previously reported in the literature. We model this behavior by treating chemotaxis as an effective magnetic interaction between the ant velocity and the local chemical gradient. Under suitable approximations, the model yields an analytical expression for the velocity correlations in the direction perpendicular to the trail, predicting an underdamped oscillatory decay. This theoretical prediction is in qualitative agreement with our experimental measurements, indicating that the model captures the essential dynamical features of ant trail following. We fit the model parameters to individual trajectories in order to assess the consistency of the underlying assumptions, finding the same parameter relationship in both theory and experiment. Our results contribute to the characterization of chemotactic navigation in ants and illustrate how physical modeling can provide mechanistic insights into complex biological dynamics.

Title: Scaling intra-urban climate fluctuations
Authors: Marc Duran-Sala, Martin Hendrick, Gabriele Manoli
Abstract: Urban-induced changes in local microclimate, such as urban heat islands and air pollution, are known to vary with city size, leading to distinctive relations between average climate variables and city-scale quantities (e.g., total population). However, these approaches suffer from biases related to the choice of city boundaries and they neglect intra-urban variations of urban characteristics. Here, we use high-resolution data of urban temperatures, air quality, population, and street networks from 142 cities worldwide and show that their marginal and joint probability distributions collapse onto a set of general scaling functions. Using a logarithmic relation between urban spatial features and climate variables, we find that average street network properties are sufficient to characterize the entire variability of the temperature and air pollution fields observed within and across cities. These findings provide a unified statistical framework for characterizing intra-urban climate variability, with important implications for climate modeling and urban planning.

Title: 't Hooft Anomalies and Defect Conformal Manifolds: Topological Signatures from Modulated Effective Actions
Authors: Christian Copetti
Abstract: Symmetry breaking of continuous symmetries by extended dynamical defects entails the existence of defect families, which form conformal manifolds in a critical setup. In the presence of bulk 't Hooft anomalies, defects are in fact required to break the symmetry: defect conformal manifolds are anomaly-enforced. We show that, by coupling the system to a modulated deformation parameter, the geometric structure of the conformal manifold is sensitive to the 't Hooft anomaly. This leads to measurable effects in the presence of a boundary/defect: in (1+1)d the anomaly predicts a quantized boundary charge pumping, while in higher dimensions it gives rise to non-dissipative boundary Hall currents.

Title: DDNet: A Unified Physics-Informed Deep Learning Framework for Semiconductor Device Modeling
Authors: Roberto Riganti, Matteo G. C. Alasio, Enrico Bellotti, Luca Dal Negro
Abstract: The accurate modeling of semiconductor devices plays a critical role in the development of new technology nodes and next-generation devices. Semiconductor device designers largely rely on advanced simulation software to solve the drift-diffusion equations, a coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations that describe carrier transport in semiconductor devices. While these tools perform well for forward modeling, they are not suitable to address inverse problems, for example, determining doping profiles, material, and geometrical parameters given a desired device performance. Meanwhile, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have grown in popularity in recent years thanks to their ability to efficiently and accurately solve inverse problems at minimal computational cost compared to forward problems. In this study, we introduce the Drift-Diffusion Network (DDNet), a unified physics-informed deep learning solver for the forward and inverse mesh-free solutions of the drift-diffusion equations of semiconductor device modeling. Using prototypical device configurations in one- and two spatial dimensions, we show that DDNet achieves low absolute and relative error compared to traditional simulation software while additionally solving user-defined inverse problems with minimal computational overhead. We expect that DDNet will benefit semiconductor device modeling by facilitating exploration and discovery of novel device structures across comprehensive parameter sets in a fully automated way.

Abstract: The robust diagnosis of thermodynamic conditions in warm dense matter experiments remains a central challenge. We report angle-resolved femtosecond x-ray Thomson scattering measurements of shock-compressed aluminum at approximately 50 GPa over a wide range of scattering wavevectors at the European XFEL. The measured plasmon dispersion and line shape demonstrate that the standard analysis of x-ray Thomson scattering spectra based on uniform electron gas models systematically overestimates the plasmon resonance energy by up to 8 eV. In contrast, an analysis based on ab initio calculations reproduces both the dispersion and spectral shape within experimental uncertainty. Our results show that shock-induced disorder plays a critical role in the interpretation of x-ray Thomson scattering from compressed solids and provide direct evidence that ab initio approaches are required for reliable inference of thermodynamic conditions in warm dense aluminum.

Title: Exact Relation Between Wehrl-Rényi Entropy and Many-Body Entanglement
Authors: Pengfei Zhang, Chen Xu, Peng Zhang
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is key to understanding correlations and emergent phenomena in quantum many-body systems. For $N$ qubits (distinguishable spin-$1/2$ particles) in a pure quantum state, many-body entanglement can be characterized by the purity of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem, defined as the trace of the square of this reduced density matrix. Nevertheless, this approach depends on the choice of subsystem. In this letter, we establish an exact relation between the Wehrl-Rényi entropy (WRE) $S_W^{(2)}$, which is the 2nd Rényi entropy of the Husimi function of the entire system, and the purities of all possible subsystems. Specifically, we prove the relation $e^{-S_W^{(2)}} = (6\pi)^{-N} \sum_A \mathrm{Tr}({{\hat \rho}_A}^2)$, where $A$ denotes a subsystem with reduced density matrix ${\hat \rho}_A$, and the summation runs over all $2^N$ possible subsystems. Furthermore, we show that the WRE can be experimentally measured via a concrete scheme. Therefore, the WRE is a subsystem-independent and experimentally measurable characterization of the overall entanglement in pure states of $N$ qubits. It can be applied to the study of strongly correlated spin systems, particularly those with all-to-all couplings that do not have a natural subsystem division, such as systems realized with natural atoms in optical tweezer arrays or superconducting quantum circuits. We also analytically derive the WRE for several representative many-body states, including Haar-random states, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and the W state.

The main objective is to explore the potential of underutilized biomass resources, such as spent coffee grounds (SCG) and date seeds (DS), for sustainable hydrogen production. Specifically, it aims to optimize the pyrolysis process while evaluating the performance of these resources both individually and as blends. Proximate, ultimate, fibre, TGA/DTG, kinetic, thermodynamic, and Py-Micro GC analyses were conducted for pure DS, SCG, and blends (75% DS - 25% SCG, 50% DS - 50% SCG, 25% DS - 75% SCG). Blend 3 offered superior hydrogen yield potential but had the highest activation energy (Ea: 313.24 kJ/mol), while Blend 1 exhibited the best activation energy value (Ea: 161.75 kJ/mol). The kinetic modelling based on isoconversional methods (KAS, FWO, Friedman) identified KAS as the most accurate. These approaches provide a detailed understanding of the pyrolysis process, with particular emphasis on the integration of artificial intelligence. An LSTM model trained with lignocellulosic data predicted TGA curves with exceptional accuracy (R^2: 0.9996-0.9998).

Title: Casimir interactions between two parallel graphene sheets carrying steady-state drift currents
Authors: Modi Ke, Dai-Nam Le, Lilia M. Woods
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuation-induced Casimir interactions between two parallel graphene sheets carrying steady-state drift currents. The graphene properties are modeled based on the shifted Fermi disk model to capture the non-equilibrium optical response of the system. We find that the drift current introduces a repulsive correction to the perpendicular to the layers Casimir interaction, thereby reducing the overall attractive force. Although the correction is repulsive, it does not overcome the underlying attraction between the layers. It also generates a lateral force that opposes the carrier flow direction. Both contributions are studied in terms of distance and drift velocity functionalities showing pathways for Casimir force control.

Title: The Topological Origin of Bohm Resistivity in Magnetic Reconnection
Authors: Magnus F Ivarsen
Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta~\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation in the model: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, consistent with magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.

Title: Bridging Elastic and Active Turbulence
Authors: Vedad Dzanic, Sumesh P. Thampi, Julia M. Yeomans
Abstract: Remarkably, even under negligible inertia, the addition of microstructural agents can generate chaotic flow fields. Such behavior can arise in polymer solutions, leading to elastic turbulence, or from active, self-driven particles, which generate active turbulence. Here, we demonstrate a close and hitherto unrecognized connection between these two classes of turbulence. Specifically, we reveal that their continuum descriptions are analogous at the macroscopic level, such that polymeric fluids can be interpreted as a deformable analogue of contractile active matter. Moreover, our numerical results for Kolmogorov flow demonstrate that the transition into the well-known traveling arrowhead structures in elastic turbulence is marked by the emergence of $\pm 1/2$ topological defects, long recognized as a defining feature of active turbulence, in the polymer director field. Importantly, these coherent structures originate from a transverse instability driven by activity-like gradients generated by anisotropically stretched, contractile polymers. At sufficiently strong activity, the system undergoes a transition into a flow-suppressed state characterized by weak polymer stretching and ordering, a behavior that can be explained by analogy with the spontaneous-flow transition observed in channel-confined active nematics.
