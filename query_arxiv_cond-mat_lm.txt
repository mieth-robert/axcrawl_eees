Title: How to Incorporate External Fields in Analog Ising Machines
Authors: Robbe De Prins, Jacob Lamers, Peter Bienstman, Guy Van der Sande, Guy Verschaffelt, Thomas Van Vaerenbergh
Abstract: Ising machines (IMs) are specialized devices designed to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). They consist of artificial spins that evolve towards a low-energy configuration representing a problem's solution. Most realistic COPs require both spin-spin couplings and external fields. In IMs with analog spins, these interactions scale differently with the continuous spin amplitudes, leading to imbalances that affect performance. Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate this issue, but their performance has not been benchmarked. We address this gap through a numerical analysis. We evaluate the time-to-solution of these methods across three distinct problem classes with up to 500 spins. Our results show that the most effective way to incorporate external fields is through an approach where the spin interactions are proportional to the spin signs, rather than their continuous amplitudes.

Title: Estimation of oil recovery due to wettability changes in carbonate reservoirs
Authors: A.C. Alvarez, H. Bruining, D. Marchesin
Abstract: Low salinity waterflooding (LSWF) enhances oil recovery at low cost in carbonate reservoirs, but its effectiveness requires precise control of injected water chemistry and interaction with reservoir minerals. This study develops an integrated reactive transport model coupling geochemical surface complexation modeling (SCM) with multiphase compositional dynamics to quantify wettability alteration during LSWF. The framework combines PHREEQC-based equilibrium calculations of the Total Bond Product (TBP), a wettability indicator derived from oil-calcite ionic bridging, with Corey-type relative permeability interpolation, resolved via COMSOL Multiphysics. Core flooding simulations, compared with experimental data from calcite systems at 100 degrees Celsius and 220 bar, reveal that magnesium and sulfate concentrations modulate TBP, reducing oil-rock adhesion under controlled low-salinity conditions. Parametric analysis demonstrates that acidic crude oils (TAN higher than 1 mg KOH per gram) exhibit TBP values approximately 2.5 times higher than sweet crudes, due to carboxylate-calcite bridging, while pH elevation (above 7.5) amplifies wettability shifts by promoting deprotonated carboxyl interactions. The model further identifies synergistic effects between magnesium (50 to 200 millimoles per kilogram of water) and sulfate (above 500 millimoles per kilogram of water), which reduce calcium-mediated oil adhesion through competitive mineral surface binding. By correlating TBP with fractional flow dynamics, this framework could support the optimization of injection strategies in carbonate reservoirs, suggesting that ion-specific adjustments are more effective than bulk salinity reduction.

Title: Higher-order Topological Parity Anomaly and Half-integer Hall Effect in High-dimensional Synthetic Lattices
Authors: Xian-Hao Wei, Xi-Wang Luo, Guang-Can Guo, Zheng-Wei Zhou
Abstract: Recent advances in constructing synthetic dimension provide a powerful tool for exploring exotic topological states of matter in high dimensions. Here we report that the parity anomaly and associated \textit{half-integer} quantized Hall conductance, arising in 2$j$+1 (space-time) dimensions with a single or odd number of Dirac cones, can be realized by the boundary states of $n$-th order topological insulators in (2$j$+$n$)-dimensional synthetic lattices. We establish a general bulk-boundary correspondence by integrating the ``nested" Wilson loop theory with the time-reversal polarization at highly-symmetric momenta, a set of $Z_2$ topological invariants are extracted which determines the number of higher-order-boundary Dirac cones and their locations. We develop a general construction procedure for Hamiltonians supporting such higher-order topological parity anomaly. Moreover, we propose an experimental implementation scheme based on photonic synthetic dimensions and provide a method for probing the associated half-integer Hall conductance by the transmission spectra. Our work offers the realization and characterization of parity anomaly in general high-dimensional higher-order topological insulators and opens an avenue for exploring fundamental physics and possible device applications enabled by manipulating Dirac cones.

Title: The Two-Fluid Theory for Superfluid Hydrodynamics and the Fountain Pressure Paradox
Authors: Phil Attard
Abstract: The two-fluid theory for superfluid hydrodynamics is derived from the fountain pressure result that condensed bosons move at constant entropy, and that therefore steady superfluid flow connects regions of equal chemical potential. The paradox of the fountain pressure equation is resolved with a quantitative prediction.

Title: Propagation of Spin Waves in Doubly Periodic Magnonic Crystals
Authors: Adam G. Whitney, Joshua M. Lewis, Justin Dickovick, Vijay Kalappattil, Lincoln D. Carr, Mingzhong Wu
Abstract: Towards the development of strategies for tailoring spin-wave band gaps in magnonic crystals, this work examines the band gap properties in a one-dimensional magnonic crystal with double periodicity. A long and narrow yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film strip is etched with an array of transverse groove lines separated by alternating distances, where the second distance is twice the first. This double periodicity in the magnonic crystal translates into dissimilar band gaps in the frequency domain, with the third and sixth band gaps being more pronounced than others. These band gaps are more pronounced because the corresponding wavenumbers simultaneously satisfy the Bragg scattering conditions for the periods equal to the two groove separations as well as their sum. Experimental observations are reproduced by numerical simulations. Together, the experimental and numerical results demonstrate how multiple periodicities could be an effective design parameter for creating magnonic crystals with desired band gaps.

Title: Majorana Edge Modes as Quantum Memory for Topological Quantum Computing
Authors: Jasmin Bedow, Dirk K. Morr
Abstract: We demonstrate that a combination of Majorana edge modes (MEMs) and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) located in the vortex cores of two-dimensional topological superconductors represent a new platform for the efficient implementation of fault-tolerant quantum gates. By calculating the full many-body dynamics of the system, we demonstrate the successful simulation and visualization of $Z$-, $X$- and Hadamard gates, with MEMs being functionalized as quantum memory. Our results open a new platform for the efficient implementation of fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Title: Probing time-reversal symmetry breaking at microwave frequencies
Authors: T. Chouinard, D. M. Broun
Abstract: Motivated by experiments carried out in the near infrared using zero-loop-area Sagnac interferometers, we explore electromagnetic signatures of time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) at microwave frequencies, using as a prototypical example a semiclassical conductor in a magnetic field. TRSB is generically accompanied by a skew-symmetric term in the electrodynamic response tensors (permittivity, conductivity, surface impedance), imparting a nonreciprocal phase shift to left- and right-circularly polarized electromagnetic waves reflected from the surface of such a material. We show that TRSB manifests as a difference in the surface reactance experienced by circularly polarized waves, and can be detected using a doubly degenerate resonator mode, such as the TE$_{111}$ mode of a cylindrical cavity. In addition to the frequency splitting induced by TRSB we show that, when interrogated by circularly polarized microwaves, the forward and reverse transmission responses of such a resonator break reciprocity, providing a crucial signature that distinguishes true Faraday effects (i.e., circular birefringence) from non-TRSB effects such as linear birefringence. In the limit that the sample is larger than the spot size (i.e., larger than the diameter of the microwave cavity) we show that the TRSB resonator has sensitivity to polar Kerr angle comparable to that of the zero-loop-area Sagnac, and should provide complementary insights into unconventional superconductors such as UPt$_3$ and Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ that have been observed to spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry.

Title: Epitaxial growth of gold films on the elemental superconductors V(100), Nb(100) and Nb(110)

Abstract: Quantum technologies require a new generation of superconducting electronic devices and circuitry. However, the superconducting materials used to construct them are restricted to a class of bulk superconductors. Gold films grown in contact with superconducting materials can exhibit superconducting correlations through the proximity effect, with various possible implementations in quantum technology. Here, we study the growth of flat Au films on various surfaces of the elemental superconductors vanadium and niobium through a combination of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In particular, we investigate the growth morphology and composition as a function of temperature and coverage. We find that gold films can grow flat and oxygen-free when annealed to sufficiently high temperatures; however, they are also susceptible to partial intermixing with the substrate elements. Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements elucidate the emergence of a proximitized superconducting gap at the gold surface. Additionally, we demonstrate the survival of the magnetic state of FeTPP-Cl molecules on the surface of these gold films, proving that they behave as a good support for probing molecular magnetism. We found that the exchange interaction between the molecular spin and the superconducting condensate can be inferred by the measurement of sub-gap Yu-Shiva-Rusinov states. Our work shows that proximitised Au films constitute a promising platform to explore on-superconducting-surface synthesis and the interaction between superconductivity and magnetism in a large spin-orbit coupling environment.

Title: Physics-informed machine learning applied to the identification of high-pressure elusive phases from spatially resolved X-ray diffraction large datasets

Abstract: Multi-technique high resolution X-ray mapping enhanced by the recent advent of 4th generation synchrotron facilities can produce colossal datasets, challenging traditional analysis methods. Such difficulty is clearly materialized when probing crystal structure of inhomogeneous samples, where the number of diffraction patterns quickly increases with map resolution, making the identification of crystal phases within a vast collection of reflections unfeasibly challenging by direct human inspection. Here we develop a novel analysis approach based on unsupervised clustering algorithms for identifying independent phases within a diffraction spatial map, which allowed us to identify the material distribution across a high-pressure cerium hydride. By investigating the specific compound, we also contribute to the understanding of synthesis inhomogeneities among the superhydrides, a prominent superconductor class in condensed matter physics whose characterization is highly challenging even for state-of-the-art materials techniques. The analysis framework we present may be readily extended to any correlated set of curves whose features are tied to specific entities, such as structural phases.

Title: Ten-valley excitonic complexes in charge-tunable monolayer WSe$_2$

Abstract: The optical response of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors such as monolayer WSe$_2$ is dominated by excitons. Enhanced interactions result in the formation of many-body excitonic complexes, which provide a testing ground for excitons and quantum many-body theories. In particular, correlated many-body excitonic complexes could constitute a limiting case that puts competing exciton descriptions to the test. Here, we report a hitherto unobserved many-body excitonic complex that emerges upon electrostatically doping both the $K$ and $Q$ valleys with charge carriers. We optically probe the WSe$_2$ exciton landscape using charge-tunable devices with unusually thin gate dielectrics that facilitate doping up to several $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this previously unexplored regime, we observe the emergence of the thermodynamically stable state in the presence of as many as 10 filled valleys. We gain insight into the physics of this complex using magneto-optical measurements. Our results are well-described by a model where the behavior of the formed exciton complex depends on the number of distinguishable Fermi seas with which the photoexcited electron-hole pair interacts. In addition to expanding the repertoire of excitons in 2D semiconductors, the extremal nature of this complex could probe the limit of exciton models and could help answer open questions about the screened Coulomb interaction in low-dimensional semiconductors.

Title: Collective excitations and stability of a non-Fermi liquid state near a quantum-critical point of a metal
Authors: Yasha Gindikin, Dmitrii L. Maslov, Andrey V. Chubukov
Abstract: We examine the spectral properties of collective excitations with finite angular momentum $l$ for a system of interacting fermions near a Pomeranchuk quantum critical point, both in the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid regimes. Previous studies found that deep in the Fermi liquid regime, the spectral functions for even and odd $l$ behave differently - the latter is suppressed compared to the former because of kinematic constraints on scattering processes. The main focus of our paper is to understand how the spectral functions for even and odd $l$ evolve as the system enters the non-Fermi liquid regime. We obtain the full scaling function for the electron polarization bubble at arbitrary $l$, which interpolates between the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid regimes. We show that collective excitations for all $l$ remain stable and causal throughout the crossover and right at the quantum critical point.

Title: Effective synchronization amid noise-induced chaos
Authors: Benjamin Sorkin, Thomas A. Witten
Abstract: Two remote agents with synchronized clocks may use them to act in concert and communicate. This necessitates some means of creating and maintaining synchrony. One method, not requiring any direct interaction between the agents, is exposing them to a common, environmental, stochastic forcing. This "noise-induced synchronization" only occurs under sufficiently mild forcing; stronger forcing disrupts synchronization. We investigate the regime of strong noise, where the clocks' phases evolve chaotically. Using a simple realization of disruptive noise, we demonstrate effective synchronization. Namely, although the phases of the two clocks vary erratically, their probability distributions at a given moment become identical. We exploit this statistical synchrony to define an effective phase for an agent that closely agrees with the other's phase. We discuss how this synchronization of ensembles broadens the range in which noise-induced synchronization can be used, and how it might be exploited in living systems.

Title: Stacking-Selective Epitaxy of Rare-Earth Diantimonides
Authors: Reiley Dorrian, Jinwoong Kim, Adrian Llanos, Veronica Show, Mizuki Ohno, Nicholas Kioussis, Joseph Falson
Abstract: Deterministic control of the layering configuration of two-dimensional quantum materials plays a central role in studying their emergent electronic properties. Here we demonstrate in-situ control over competing stacking configurations in thin film crystals of the rare-earth diantimonides by synthesizing in proximity to competing structural orders. A crossover between the epitaxially stabilized monoclinic structure and the orthorhombic structure commonly observed in bulk crystals is navigated through three axes; the relative cation/anion ratio, growth temperature, and choice of lanthanide ion, culminating with a comparative magnetotransport study of single-yet-distinct phase CeSb2 films. These results set the stage for an expanded search for hidden stacking configurations in layered compounds which have evaded detection.

Title: Tuning the magnetic properties of spin-split antiferromagnet MnTe through pressure
Authors: Edison P. Carlisle, George Yumnam, Stuart Calder, Bianca Haberl, Jia-Xin Xiong, Michael A. McGuire, Alex Zunger, Raphaël P. Hermann, Benjamin A. Frandsen
Abstract: The hexagonal antiferromagnet MnTe has attracted enormous interest as a prototypical example of a spin-compensated magnet in which the combination of crystal and spin symmetries lifts the spin degeneracy of the electron bands without the need for spin-orbit coupling, a phenomenon called non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS). Subgroups of NRSS are determined by the specific spin-interconverting symmetry that connects the two opposite-spin sublattices. In MnTe, this symmetry is rotation, leading to the subgroup with spin splitting away from the Brillouin zone center, often called altermagnetism. MnTe also has the largest spontaneous magnetovolume effect of any known antiferromagnet, implying strong coupling between the magnetic moment and volume. This magnetostructural coupling offers a potential knob for tuning the spin-splitting properties of MnTe. Here, we use neutron diffraction with $\textit{in situ}$ applied pressure to determine the effects of pressure on the magnetic properties of MnTe and further explore this magnetostructural coupling. We find that applying pressure significantly increases the Néel temperature but decreases the ordered magnetic moment. We explain this as a consequence of strengthened magnetic exchange interactions under pressure, resulting in higher $T_\mathrm{N}$, with a simultaneous reduction of the local moment of individual Mn atoms, described here via density functional theory. This reflects the increased orbital hybridization and electron delocalization with pressure. These results show that the magnetic properties of MnTe can be controlled by pressure, opening the door to improved properties for spintronic applications through tuning via physical or chemical pressure.

Title: Fractional Chern insulator states in an isolated flat band of zero Chern number
Authors: Zuzhang Lin, Wenqi Yang, Hongyu Lu, Dawei Zhai, Wang Yao
Abstract: A flat band with zero Chern number, and well isolated from the rest of Hilbert space by a gap much larger than interaction strength, is a context that has not been regarded as relevant for fractional quantum Hall physics. In this work, we present a numerical study to demonstrate the emergence of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in such isolated flat band with zero Chern number, which is hosted by a fluxed dice lattice with anisotropic hopping strength. While being topologically trivial, this flat band features an intriguing quantum geometry: the difference between the trace of quantum metric tensor and the Berry curvature is a constant. We consider nearest-neighbor repulsion that is weak enough to ensure that the isolated band limit is always satisfied, where band renormalization by interaction leaves the flat band quantum geometry unchanged and introduce a tiny band width only. At $2/3$ filling of the isolated flat band, our exact diagonalization calculations show unambiguous evidences for the FCI states, both from the many-body spectra and the many-body Chern number that demonstrates a fractionally quantized Hall conductance of $e^2/3h$. And the 3-fold ground state degeneracy on torus suggests that band-folding Hall crystal scenario is not compatible with the observed $1/3$ quantized Hall conductance at $2/3$ filling. We find the finite dispersion acquired from interaction renormalization, albeit tiny in the isolated band limit, is necessary for FCI to emerge. With anisotropy getting stronger towards the disconnected-chains limit, the FCI undergoes a topological phase transition to inter-chain charge density wave.

Title: Composition-Dependent Thermoelectric Properties of Hybrid Tin Perovskites (CH3NH3)xCs1-xSnI3: Insights into Electrical and Thermal Performance
Authors: Alexandra Ivanova, Olga Kutsemako, Aleksandra Khanina, Pavel Gorbachev, Margarita Golikova, Irina Shamova, Olga Volkova, Lev Luchnikov, Pavel Gostishchev, Danila Saranin, Vladimir Khovaylo
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive investigation of the thermoelectric properties of bulk hybrid perovskites with the general formula MAxCs1-xSnI3 (0 < x < 1). A series of bulk samples were synthesized and systematically characterized to explore the relationship between composition, microstructure, and thermoelectric performance. Compositions with intermediate MA+ content (x = 0.2 and x = 0.5) show an optimal balance between electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, yielding high power factor values (0.6 - 0.7 muW/cmK2 at 423 K) and favorable thermoelectric performance with zT values up to 0.06. In contrast, compositions with MA+ contents (x = 0, x = 0.6, and x = 0.8) exhibit lower thermoelectric performance due to reduced Seebeck coefficients or suppressed conductivity. MASnI3 shows promising low-temperature thermoelectric performance with a maximum $zT$ of 0.10 at 423 K, attributed to its rapidly increasing Seebeck coefficient. These findings highlight the importance of microstructural control and composition optimization in the development of hybrid perovskites for thermoelectric applications.

Title: Magnetically Modulated Electrical Switching in an Antiferromagnetic Transistor
Authors: Chung-Tao Chou, Eugene Park, Josep Ingla-Aynes, Julian Klein, Kseniia Mosina, Jagadeesh S. Moodera, Zdenek Sofer, Frances M. Ross, Luqiao Liu
Abstract: A spin version of transistor, where magnetism is used to influence electrical behaviors of the semiconductor, has been a long-pursued device concept in spintronics. In this work, we experimentally study a field-effect transistor with CrSBr, a van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnetic semiconductor, as the channel material. Unlike the weak magnetic tunability of in-plane currents previously reported in vdW magnets, the channel current of our transistor is efficiently tuned by both gate voltage and magnetic transitions, achieving a magnetoresistance ratio as high as 1500%. Combining measurement and theoretical modeling, we reveal magnetically modulated carrier concentration as the origin of the large magnetoresistance. The strategy of using both magnetic ordering and electric field in the same device to control ON/OFF states of a transistor opens a new avenue of energy-efficient spintronics for memory, logic and magnetic sensing applications.

Title: Polarization switching in sliding ferroelectrics: the roles of fluctuation and domain wall
Authors: Ziwen Wang, Shuai Dong
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity is highly attractive for its low energy barriers and fatigue resistance. As the origin of these exotic properties, its unconventional switching dynamics remains poorly understood: how an electric field drives a perpendicular sliding? Taking $h$-BN bilayer as a model system, its switching dynamics is studied using \textit{ab initio} calculations. The off-diagonal Born effective charge leads to the perpendicular relationship between the electric field and ionic movements. Interestingly, the rules of intrinsic coercive field are distinct between $h$-BN bilayer and conventional ferroelectrics. For $h$-BN bilayer, any perturbation breaking the in-plane symmetry plays a key role to assist the avalanche-like switching dynamics. Moreover, the exotic large off-diagonal Born effective charge near the $P=0$ intermediate state results in a wriggling motion of domain walls in $h$-BN bilayer. Our results reveal the key factors in the ferroelectric switching of sliding ferroelectrics at room temperature.

Title: Benchmarking Energy Calculations Using Formal Proofs
Authors: Ejike D. Ugwuanyi, Colin T. Jones, John Velkey, Tyler R. Josephson
Abstract: Traditional approaches for validating molecular simulations rely on making software open source and transparent, incorporating unit testing, and generally employing human oversight. We propose an approach that eliminates software errors using formal logic, providing proofs of correctness. We use the Lean theorem prover and programming language to create a rigorous, mathematically verified framework for computing molecular interaction energies. We demonstrate this in LeanLJ, a package of functions, proofs, and code execution software that implements Lennard Jones energy calculations in periodic boundaries. We introduce a strategy that uses polymorphic functions and typeclasses to bridge formal proofs (about idealized Real numbers) and executable programs (over floating point numbers). Execution of LeanLJ matches the current gold standard NIST benchmarks, while providing even stronger guarantees, given LeanLJ's grounding in formal mathematics. This approach can be extended to formally verified molecular simulations, in particular, and formally verified scientific computing software, in general. Keywords: Formal verification, Lean 4, molecular simulations, functional programming.

Title: Extended Dynamical Kubo-Toyabe Relaxation for $μ$SR study of Ion Dynamics: An Introduction
Authors: Takashi U. Ito, Ryosuke Kadono
Abstract: In the analysis of the ion diffusion in metal oxides based on muon spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR), the dynamical Kubo-Toyabe (dKT) function has been routinely used to deduce the jump frequency of ions. This is based on the two beliefs: (1) the fluctuations of the internal magnetic field ${\bm H}(t)$ are determined solely by the relative motion of the muons to the surrounding ions, and (2) the muons are immobile due to bonding to the oxygen. However, these are not necessarily trivial, and we addressed their credibility by developing an extended dKT function corresponding to the realistic situation that only a part of the ions surrounding muon are involved in a single fluctuation of ${\bm H}(t)$ in the ion diffusion, and investigated its behavior in detail. The results show that the new function exhibits qualitatively different behavior from the dKT function, and that it provides a way to determine whether muons or ions are in motion, as well as a means for quantitative analysis based on the assumption of immobile muons. As a typical example, we examine the earlier $\mu^\pm$SR results on Na$_x$CoO$_2$ and demonstrate that the internal field fluctuations observed in $\mu^+$SR are dominated by muon self-diffusion, in contrast to previous interpretations.

Title: Bridging Theory and Experiment in Materials Discovery: Machine-Learning-Assisted Prediction of Synthesizable Structures
Authors: Yu Xin, Peng Liu, Zhuohang Xie, Wenhui Mi, Pengyue Gao, Hong Jian Zhao, Jian Lv, Yanchao Wang, Yanming Ma
Abstract: Even though thermodynamic energy-based crystal structure prediction (CSP) has revolutionized materials discovery, the energy-driven CSP approaches often struggle to identify experimentally realizable metastable materials synthesized through kinetically controlled pathways, creating a critical gap between theoretical predictions and experimental synthesis. Here, we propose a synthesizability-driven CSP framework that integrates symmetry-guided structure derivation with a Wyckoff encode-based machine-learning model, allowing for the efficient localization of subspaces likely to yield highly synthesizable structures. Within the identified promising subspaces, a structure-based synthesizability evaluation model, fine-tuned using recently synthesized structures to enhance predictive accuracy, is employed in conjunction with ab initio calculations to systematically identify synthesizable candidates. The framework successfully reproduces 13 experimentally known XSe (X = Sc, Ti, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn) structures, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting synthesizable structures. Notably, 92,310 structures are filtered from the 554,054 candidates predicted by GNoME, exhibiting great potential for promising synthesizability. Additionally, eight thermodynamically favorable Hf-X-O (X = Ti, V, and Mn) structures have been identified, among which three HfV$_2$O$_7$ candidates exhibit high synthesizability, presenting viable candidates for experimental realization and potentially associated with experimentally observed temperature-induced phase transitions. This work establishes a data-driven paradigm for machine-learning-assisted inorganic materials synthesis, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between computational predictions and experimental realization while unlocking new opportunities for the targeted discovery of novel functional materials.

Title: Nonlinearity-induced reversal of electromagnetic non-Hermitian skin effect
Authors: Junyao Wu, Rui-Chang Shen, Li Zhang, Fujia Chen, Bingbing Wang, Hongsheng Chen, Yihao Yang, Haoran Xue
Abstract: The interplay between band topology and material nonlinearity gives rise to a variety of novel phenomena, such as topological solitons and nonlinearity-induced topological phase transitions. However, most previous studies fall within the Hermitian regime, leaving the impact of nonlinearity on non-Hermitian topology seldom explored. Here, we investigate the effects of nonlinearity on the non-Hermitian skin effect, a well-known non-Hermitian phenomenon induced by the point-gap topology unique to non-Hermitian systems. Interestingly, we discover a nonlinearity-induced point-gap topological phase transition accompanied by a reversal of the skin mode localization, which is distinct from previous nonlinearity-induced line-gap topological phases. This phenomenon is experimentally demonstrated in a nonlinear microwave metamaterial, where electromagnetic waves are localized around one end of the sample under a low-intensity pump, whereas at a high-intensity pump, the waves are localized around the other end. Our results open a new route towards nonlinear topological physics in non-Hermitian systems and are promising for reconfigurable topological wave manipulation.

Title: Wavefunction-Free Approach for Predicting Nonlinear Responses in Weyl Semimetals

Abstract: By sidestepping the intractable calculations of many-body wavefunctions, density functional theory (DFT) has revolutionized the prediction of ground states of materials. However, predicting nonlinear responses--critical for next-generation quantum devices--still relies heavily on explicit wavefunctions, limiting computational efficiency. In this letter, using the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals as a representative example, we realize a 1000-fold computational speedup by eliminating the explicit dependence on wavefunctions. Our approach leverages the one-to-one correspondence between free parameters of Weyl fermions and the associated responses to obtain precise wavefunction-free formulations. Applying our methodology, we systematically investigated known Weyl semimetals and revealed that Ta$_3$S$_2$ exhibits photocurrents an order of magnitude greater than those observed in TaAs, with potential for an additional order-of-magnitude enhancement under strain. Our work paves the way for substantially more efficient screening and optimization of nonlinear electromagnetic properties of topological quantum materials.

Title: Study of magneto-thermal resistance effect in a Co50Fe50/Cu multilayer through the analysis of electron and lattice thermal conductivities
Authors: Fuya Makino, Takamasa Hirai, Takuma Shiga, Hirofumi Suto, Hiroshi Fujihisa, Koichi Oyanagi, Satoru Kobayashi, Taisuke Sasaki, Takashi Yagi, Ken-ichi Uchida, Yuya Sakuraba
Abstract: This study investigates the giant magneto-thermal resistance (GMTR) effect in a fully-bcc epitaxial Co50Fe50/Cu multilayer through both experimental and theoretical approaches. The applied magnetic field results in a giant change of the cross-plane thermal conductivity ({\Delta}\k{appa}) of 37 W m-1 K-1, which reaches 1.5 times larger than the previously reported value for a magnetic multilayer and record the highest value at room temperature among the other solid-state thermal switching materials working on different principles. We investigated the electron thermal conductivity for exploring the remarkable {\Delta}\k{appa} by the two-current-series-resistor model combined with the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law. However, the result shows the electron contribution accounts for only 35% of the {\Delta}\k{appa}, indicating the presence of additional spin-dependent heat carriers. Further investigation of the lattice thermal conductivity, which is expected to be spin-independent, using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations suggests a striking contrast: the additional spin-dependent heat carrier contribution is significantly enhanced in the parallel magnetization configuration but nearly negligible in the antiparallel configuration. These findings provide a fundamental insight into the origin of large GMTR effect and highlight its potential of active thermal management technologies for future electronic devices.

Title: InvDesFlow-AL: Active Learning-based Workflow for Inverse Design of Functional Materials
Authors: Xiao-Qi Han, Peng-Jie Guo, Ze-Feng Gao, Hao Sun, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: Developing inverse design methods for functional materials with specific properties is critical to advancing fields like renewable energy, catalysis, energy storage, and carbon capture. Generative models based on diffusion principles can directly produce new materials that meet performance constraints, thereby significantly accelerating the material design process. However, existing methods for generating and predicting crystal structures often remain limited by low success rates. In this work, we propose a novel inverse material design generative framework called InvDesFlow-AL, which is based on active learning strategies. This framework can iteratively optimize the material generation process to gradually guide it towards desired performance characteristics. In terms of crystal structure prediction, the InvDesFlow-AL model achieves an RMSE of 0.0423 Å, representing an 32.96% improvement in performance compared to exsisting generative models. Additionally, InvDesFlow-AL has been successfully validated in the design of low-formation-energy and low-Ehull materials. It can systematically generate materials with progressively lower formation energies while continuously expanding the exploration across diverse chemical spaces. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active learning-driven generative model in accelerating material discovery and inverse design. To further prove the effectiveness of this method, we took the search for BCS superconductors under ambient pressure as an example explored by InvDesFlow-AL. As a result, we successfully identified Li\(_2\)AuH\(_6\) as a conventional BCS superconductor with an ultra-high transition temperature of 140 K. This discovery provides strong empirical support for the application of inverse design in materials science.

Abstract: Perovskite-based nanoscintillators, such as CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs), are emerging as promising candidates for ionizing radiation detection, thanks to their high emission efficiency, rapid response, and facile synthesis. However, their nanoscale dimensions - smaller than the mean free path of secondary carriers - and relatively low emitter density per unit volume, limited by their high molecular weight and reabsorption losses, restrict efficient secondary carrier conversion and hamper their practical deployment. In this work, we introduce a strategy to enhance scintillation performance by organizing NCs into densely packed domains within porous SiO2 mesospheres (MSNs). This engineered architecture achieves up to a 40-fold increase in radioluminescence intensity compared to colloidal NCs, driven by improved retention and conversion of secondary charges, as corroborated by electron release measurements. This approach offers a promising pathway toward developing next-generation nanoscintillators with enhanced performance, with potential applications in high-energy physics, medical imaging, and space technologies.

Title: Coexistence of Rashba and Dirac dispersions on the surface of centrosymmetric topological insulator decorated with transition metals
Authors: Giuseppe Cuono, Rajibul Islam, Amar Fakhredine, Carmine Autieri
Abstract: The Dirac cone originates from the bulk topology, yet its primary contribution comes from the surface since spatially, the Dirac state emerges at the boundary between the trivial and topological phases. At the same time, the Rashba states emerge in regions where inversion symmetry is broken. On the surface of the centrosymmetric topological insulators, both Rashba and Dirac bands are present and their hybridization produces the giant Rashba effect, modifying both Rashba's and Dirac's bands. Therefore, pure Rashba and Dirac fermions are inherently incompatible on the surface of centrosymmetric topological insulators if the material is homogeneous. Inspired by recent experiments, we focused on the (111) polar surface of PbSe, which becomes a topological crystalline insulator under compressive strain, and we established the conditions under which a topological system can simultaneously host pure Rashba and Dirac surface states close to the Fermi level. The coexistence of pure Dirac and Rashba dispersions is only possible in a non-homogeneous centrosymmetric topological insulator, where the spatial origins of the two bands are effectively separated. In the experimentally observed case of PbSe, we demonstrate that a metallic overlayer induces a strong electrostatic potential gradient in the subsurface region, which in turn generates the electric field responsible for Rashba splitting in the subsurface layers. Consequently, in PbSe(111), the Rashba states arise from subsurface layers, while the Dirac states live mainly on the surface layers. Finally, we compare the properties of the Rashba in the trivial and topological phases; the calculated Rashba coefficient agrees qualitatively with the experimental results.

Title: Deterministic Quantum Dot Cavity Placement Using Hyperspectral Imaging with High Spatial Accuracy and Precision
Authors: Quirin Buchinger, Constantin Krause, Aileen Zhang, Giora Peniakov, Mohamed Helal, Yorick Reum, Andreas Theo Pfenning, Sven Höfling, Tobias Huber-Loyola
Abstract: Single emitters in solid state are great sources of single and entangled photons. To boost their extraction efficiency and tailor their emission properties, they are often incorporated in photonic nanostructures. However, achieving accurate and reproducible placement inside the cavity is challenging but necessary to ensure the highest mode overlap and optimal device performance. For many cavity types -- such as photonic crystal cavities or circular Bragg grating cavities -- even small displacements lead to a significantly reduced emitter-cavity coupling. For circular Bragg grating cavities, this yields a significant reduction in Purcell effect, a slight reduction in efficiency and it introduces polarization on the emitted photons. Here we show a method to achieve high accuracy and precision for deterministically placed cavities on the example of circular Bragg gratings on randomly distributed semiconductor quantum dots. We introduce periodic alignment markers for improved marker detection accuracy and investigate overall imaging accuracy achieving $(9.1 \pm 2.5) nm$ through image correction. Since circular Bragg grating cavities exhibit a strong polarization response when the emitter is displaced, they are ideal devices to probe the cavity placement accuracy far below the diffraction limit. From the measured device polarizations, we derive a total spatial process accuracy of $(33.5 \pm 9.9) nm$ based on the raw data, and an accuracy of $(15 \pm 11) nm$ after correcting for the system response, resulting in a device yield of $68 \%$ for well-placed cavities.

Title: High Chern Number Quantum Anomalous Hall States in Haldane-Graphene Multilayers
Authors: Yuejiu Zhao, Long Zhang, Fu-Chun Zhang
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) systems with high Chern number ($|C|>1$) are rare. This Letter introduces a Haldane-graphene multilayer heterostructure hosting QAH states with arbitrary Chern number. In a rhombohedral-stacked graphene $N$-layer, the Dirac points at $K_{\pm}$ become $N^\text{th}$-order zeros of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian. When an extra layer of Haldane model is stacked on top of the multilayer, the high-order Dirac points are gapped out and the heterostructure enters QAH phases with $|C|=N+1$. Therefore, gapping out high-order Dirac points paves a new way to high Chern number QAH states.

Title: Functional approach to superfluid stiffness: Role of quantum geometry in unconventional superconductivity
Authors: Maximilian Buthenhoff, Tobias Holder, Michael M. Scherer
Abstract: Non-trivial quantum geometry of electronic bands has been argued to facilitate superconductivity even for the case of flat dispersions where the conventional contribution to the superfluid weight is suppressed by the large effective mass. However, most previous work focused on the case of conventional superconductivity while many contemporary superconducting quantum materials are expected to host unconventional pairing. Here, we derive a generalized expression for the superfluid weight employing mean-field BCS theory for systems with time-reversal symmetry in the normal state and arbitrary unconventional superconducting order with zero-momentum intraband pairing. Our derivation reveals the necessity of incorporating functional derivatives of the grand potential with respect to the superconducting gap function. Through perturbative analysis in the isolated narrow-bands limit, we demonstrate that this contribution arises from quantum geometrical effects, specifically due to a non-trivial Wilczek-Zee connection. Utilizing the newly obtained expressions for the superfluid weight, we apply our framework to an extended Kane-Mele model, contrasting conventional $s$-wave superconductivity with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.

Title: Recent progress on electron- and magnon-mediated torques
Authors: Jia-Min Lai, Bingyue Bian, Zhonghai Yu, Kaiwei Guo, Yajing Zhang, Pengnan Zhao, Xiaoqian Zhang, Chunyang Tang, Jiasen Cao, Zhiyong Quan, Fei Wang, Xiaohong Xu
Abstract: The growing demand for artificial intelligence and complex computing has underscored the urgent need for advanced data storage technologies. Spin-orbit torque (SOT) has emerged as a leading candidate for high-speed, high-density magnetic random-access memory due to its ultrafast switching speed and low power consumption. This review systematically explores the generation and switching mechanisms of electron-mediated torques (including both conventional SOTs and orbital torques) and magnon-mediated torques. We discuss key materials that enable these effects: heavy metals, topological insulators, low-crystal-symmetry materials, non-collinear antiferromagnets, and altermagnets for conventional SOTs; 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals for orbital torques; and antiferromagnetic insulator NiO- and multiferroic BiFeO3-based sandwich structures for magnon torques. We emphasize that although key components of SOT devices have been demonstrated, numerous promising materials and critical questions regarding their underlying mechanisms remain to be explored. Therefore, this field represents a dynamic and rapidly evolving frontier in spintronics, offering significant potential for advancing next-generation information storage and computational technologies.

Title: Current Conservation in the Self-Consistent Josephson Junction
Authors: Simon Krekels, Vukan Levajac, Kristof Moors, George Simion, Bart Sorée
Abstract: Conventional treatments of Josephson junctions (JJs) are generally not current-conserving. We introduce a numerical method for the self-consistent treatment of quasi-1D JJs with current conservation, with phase gradient of the order parameter in the leads matching the Josephson current through the weak link. We compare our method to standard methods and calculate the current-phase relationship (CPR) for superconductor--normal metal--superconductor JJs with different gate voltages applied to the normal metal. We show that our approach can weaken or even reverse forward skewedness of the CPR.

Title: Spin phase detection by spin current in a chiral helimagnet
Authors: Nan Jiang, Shota Suzuki, Issei Sasaki, Kazuki Yamada, Ryoma Kawahara, Shintaro Takada, Yusuke Shimamoto, Hiroki Shoji, Yusuke Kousaka, Jun-ichiro Ohe, Yoshihiko Togawa, Yasuhiro Niimi
Abstract: Helimagnets, characterized by a helical arrangement of magnetic moments, possess unique internal degrees of freedom, including the spin phase, defined by the phase of the helical magnetic structure. Electrical detection of the spin phase is essential for both practical applications and fundamental research in helimagnets. Here, we demonstrate the electrical detection of the spin phase in a van der Waals nanoscale chiral helimagnet CrNb$_3$S$_6$ using nonlocal spin valve measurements. Due to the short spin diffusion length in CrNb$_3$S$_6$ ($\sim5$~nm), the surface magnetic moment direction, which corresponds to the spin phase, can be detected via spin currents. The experimentally observed magnetic field dependence of the nonlocal spin valve signal is consistent with that of the surface magnetic moment in the helical magnetic structure, as supported by micromagnetic simulations. Our results establish spin currents as a powerful tool for detecting the spin phase in helimagnets, opening avenues for utilizing the spin phase as a novel internal degree of freedom in nanoscale spintronic devices.

Title: One-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity
Authors: Taiga Nakamoto, Kazuaki Takasan, Naoto Tsuji
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity, which describes an interplay of the effect of vacuum fluctuation of light and the quantum phase transition between the charge- and spin-density-wave phases. The ground state and excitation spectrum of the model are calculated by numerically exact tensor-network methods. We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.

Title: Tunable Hilbert space fragmentation and extended critical regime
Authors: Mateusz Lisiecki, Janez Bonča, Marcin Mierzejewski, Jacek Herbrych, Patrycja Łydżba
Abstract: Systems exhibiting the Hilbert-space fragmentation are nonergodic, and their Hamiltonians decompose into exponentially many blocks in the computational basis. In many cases, these blocks can be labeled by eigenvalues of statistically localized integrals of motion (SLIOM), which play a similar role in fragmented systems as local integrals of motion in integrable systems. While a nonzero perturbation eliminates all nontrivial conserved quantities from integrable models, we demonstrate for the $t$-$J_z$ chain that an appropriately chosen perturbation may gradually eliminate SLIOMs (one by one) by progressively merging the fragmented subspaces. This gradual recovery of ergodicity manifests as an extended critical regime characterized by multiple peaks of the fidelity susceptibility. Each peak signals a change in the number of SLIOMs and blocks, as well as an ultra-slow relaxation of local observables.

Title: Measuring superconducting arcs by ARPES
Authors: Andrii Kuibarov, Susmita Changdar, Alexander Fedorov, Rui Lou, Oleksandr Suvorov, Vera Misheneva, Luminita Harnagea, Iryna Kovalchuk, Sabine Wurmehl, Bernd Büchner, Sergey Borisenko
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is the leading tool for studying the symmetry and structure of the order parameter in superconductors. The recent improvement of the technique made it possible to detect the superconducting energy gap at the surface of topological t-PtBi2 via observation of the record-breaking narrow line shapes. The promising new physics uncovered requires further investigation of the spectral and gap functions of t-PtBi2, but the challenging experimental conditions severely limit the application of conventional ARPES setups. In this work, we use synchrotron-based measurements and show that the gap at the surface Fermi arc in t-PtBi2 can be detected even with more relaxed experimental conditions than in our previous laser-based studies. At the same time, using simple model of ARPES spectra, we identify the minimum requirements to detect the gap and consider cases where the gap cannot be resolved.

Title: Field-induced electronic correlations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$ beyond 40~T

Abstract: Several superconducting phases have been discovered close to a metamagnetic transition in the heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$, unveiling a close relation between its superconducting and magnetic properties. Although suspected to be of magnetic nature, the mechanisms stabilizing these superconducting phases remain mysterious. Here, we present electrical-resistivity measurements on UTe$_2$, with a current $\mathbf{I}\parallel\mathbf{a}$ and under pulsed magnetic fields up to 60~T rotating in the ($\mathbf{b}$,$\mathbf{c}$) plane. The Fermi-liquid coefficient $A$ of the electrical resistivity reaches its maximal values at the metamagnetic transition in fields tilted by $30-40~^\circ$ from $\mathbf{b}$ to $\mathbf{c}$, and it becomes asymmetric with higher values above the metamagnetic field than below. The enhancement of $A$ is interpreted as resulting from enhanced magnetic fluctuations, in a regime which coincides with a domain of stabilization of superconductivity beyond $40$~T. These results show that the magnetic fluctuations probed here probably play a key role in stabilizing high-field superconductivity in UTe$_2$ and may provide further insight into the superconducting mechanisms.

Title: Optoelectronic properties and performance optimization for photovoltaic applications of R3m-RbGeX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskites: A combined DFT and SCAPS-1D study
Authors: Piyush Kumar Dash, Palash Banarjee, Anupriya Nyayban, Subhasis Panda
Abstract: In pursuit of an all-inorganic non-toxic perovskite solar cell (PSC) with enhanced performance, we have investigated the rhombohedral phase of the germanium-based rubidium halide perovskites RbGeX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I). The structural analysis followed by an in-depth study of the electronic and optical properties of these materials is performed within the framework of density functional theory (DFT). A detailed investigation of the electronic properties is carried out by examining the band structure and partial density of states (PDOS). PBE and TB-mBJ exchange-correlation functionals are used with and without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), thereby obtaining accurate predictions of the band gaps. The key optical properties such as the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, absorption coefficient and refractive index are studied using PBE functional and compared among the three halides. RbGeI$_3$ exhibits the lowest band gap of 0.96 eV with the TB-mBJ + SOC functional, along with the most favorable optical properties, hence, it was identified as the most suitable candidate for the absorber layer (AL) of the PSC. SCAPS-1D simulation is performed using various input parameters for the AL such as the band gap, the effective densities of states for the conduction and valence bands and the electron and hole mobilities extracted from the DFT calculation. Performance optimization is done by exploring the impact of different inorganic hole transport layers (HTLs) and electron transport layers (ETLs). The impact of different layer thicknesses, doping densities, defect densities at the AL, ETL/AL, and AL/HTL interfaces, various back contacts, and the influence of series and shunt resistance on the overall device performance are studied. The optimized all-inorganic device demonstrated a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of $25.76\%$ with a fill factor (FF) of $79.81\%$.

Title: Imaging domain boundaries of rubrene thin crystallites by photoemission electron microscopy
Authors: Moha Naeimi, Katharina Engster, Waqas Pervez, Ingo Barke, Sylvia Speller
Abstract: The progress of designing organic semiconductors is extensively dependent on the quality of prepared organic molecular assemblies, since the charge transport mechanism is strongly efficient in highly ordered crystals compared to amorphous domains. Here we present a comprehensive photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and time-of-flight (TOF) spectroscopic study of rubrene ($\mathrm{C}_{48}\mathrm{H}_{24}$) thin crystals focusing on recently developed orthorhombic crystalline morphologies applied in organic electronic devices. Using femtosecond pulsed lasers with photon energies between 3-6 eV, we explore the interplay between photoemission processes, crystal morphology, and defect states. In a 2-photon photoemission process (2PPE), the PEEM images reveal dominant emission localized at domain boundaries, indicating strong contributions from trap states. In contrast, in 1PPE nm excitation uniform emission across the crystal surface is observed, highlighting a fundamental difference in photoemission mechanisms. Furthermore, in the intermediate photon energy range, we identify a nonlinear, non-integer photon order, where mostly the triclinic morphology contributes to the emission, distinguishing it from the orthorhombic phase. These findings provide a new framework for assessing the quality and internal structure of organic semiconductor thin films via wavelength-dependent photoemission imaging and spectroscopy.

Title: A unified bonding entropy model to determine magnetic properties in graphene nanoflakes
Authors: Chang-Chun He, Jiarui Zeng, Yu-Jun Zhao, Xiao-Bao Yang
Abstract: Graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) exhibit rich magnetic behaviors arising from two primary mechanisms: geometry frustration in non-Kekulé structures and electron delocalization-driven aromatic stabilization in Kekulé-type systems. Herein, we develop a unified bonding entropy model (BEM) to quantitatively characterize the magnetic properties in GNFs within a statistical framework, providing an entropy-based criterion for understanding and predicting bond occupancy numbers and unpaired electron distributions. While non-Kekulé systems naturally favor high-spin configurations due to topological frustration, the BEM reveals that even Kekulé-type GNFs can exhibit magnetic character when the entropy gain from unpaired electrons outweighs the loss of aromatic stabilization. The model predictions show excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations in terms of spin density distributions and unpaired electron counts. Our results establish bonding entropy as a general guiding principle for designing carbon-based magentic materials with tunable magnetic properties.

Title: The meaning of Li diffusion in cathode materials for the cycling of Li-ion batteries: A case study on LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 thin films
Authors: Erwin Hüger, Harald Schmidt
Abstract: We demonstrate that for polycrystalline LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 c-axis textured thin film cathodes of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, the kinetics of Li storage and release including maximum specific capacity is determined by Li diffusion. The C-rate capability and long-term cycling behavior were investigated. The films exhibited up to 30% of the expected practical capacity even at low C-rates. However, 100% capacity was achieved at very low cycling rates below 0.01C. The capacity showed a reversible behaviour with changing current density, indicating no film degradation. The C-rate capability experiment showed a square root dependence of capacities on current density, which corresponds to a diffusion-controlled process. The estimated diffusivities from the cycling experiments are independent of the current density. The Li chemical and tracer diffusivities were measured using standard electrochemical and non-electrochemical diffusion measurement techniques. Chemical diffusivities, thermodynamic factor, and hence Li tracer diffusivities were determined from potentiostatic intermittent titration (PITT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments as a function of electrode potential and state of charge (SOC). The diffusivities were found to be approximately independent of potential, SOC and cycle number. The Li tracer diffusivities were validated by 6Li tracer diffusion experiments with secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The diffusivities obtained by PITT and SIMS were found to be more reliable for Li uptake and release than those obtained by EIS. Based on the diffusion results, a C-rate limit for full film delithiation below 0.01 C was calculated due to slow Li diffusion.

Title: Spin Nernst and thermal Hall effects of topological triplons in quantum dimer magnets on the maple-leaf and star lattices
Authors: Nanse Esaki, Yutaka Akagi, Karlo Penc, Hosho Katsura
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the topological properties of triplon excitations in spin-1/2 dimer-singlet ground states defined on the maple leaf and star lattices. Our analysis is based on a model that includes Heisenberg interactions, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, and an external magnetic field. In the absence of an in-plane DM vector, we demonstrate that the triplon Hamiltonian maps onto the magnon Hamiltonian of the Kagome lattice, inheriting its nontrivial topological characteristics, including Berry curvature and topological invariants such as the Z2 invariant and Chern numbers. This correspondence enables us to derive analytical expressions for the spin Nernst and thermal Hall conductivities at low temperatures. Furthermore, we explore the effects of realistic finite in-plane DM interactions, uncovering multiple topological transitions and a complex thermal Hall conductivity behavior, including potential sign reversals as functions of magnetic field and temperature. Using layer groups, we also provide a symmetry classification of the star and maple leaf lattices.

Title: Using Dopants as Agents to Probe Key Electronic Properties of Organic Semiconductors
Authors: Artem Fediai, Franz Symalla, Tobias Neumann, Wolfgang Wenzel
Abstract: In organic electronics, conductivity doping is used primarily to eliminate charge injection barriers in organic light-emitting diodes, organic photovoltaics and other electronic devices. Therefore, research on conductivity doping is primarily focused on understanding and enhancing the properties of these doped layers. In contrast, this work shifts the focus from optimizing doped layers to leveraging the doping process as a tool for investigating fundamental material properties. Specifically, the dopant is used as an "agent" to enable the measurement of three critical parameters: ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), and Coulomb interaction energy (VC) - that govern dopant ionization and play central roles in organic electronic devices in general. While these parameters can be measured experimentally, conventional approaches often involve intricate or indirect methods, such as spectral deconvolution, which may introduce ambiguities or fail to represent bulk properties. Here it is shown how consolidating the experimental data and simulations on the dopant ionization fraction and doped-induced conductivity can be used to estimate the mean IP or EA of the embedded organic molecule, and VC of the embedded charge-transfer complex. These results illustrate how measuring and simulating doped materials can provide access to the fundamental design parameters of organic electronic devices

Title: Vortex and fractional quantum Hall phases in a rotating anisotropic Bose gas
Authors: Umut Tanyeri, Ahmed Kallushi, Rıfat Onur Umucalılar, Ahmet Keleş
Abstract: Realizing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in ultracold atomic systems remains a major goal despite numerous experimental advances in the last few decades. Recent progress in trap anisotropy control under rapid rotation has renewed interest in ultracold atomic FQH physics, enabling experiments that impart much larger angular momentum per particle and offer in-situ imaging with resolution finer than the cyclotron orbit size. In this paper, we present a theoretical investigation of a rapidly rotating anisotropic Bose gas. By projecting the full Hamiltonian, including both kinetic and interaction terms, onto the lowest Landau level, we derive a compact two-parameter model that captures the effects of interaction strength, rotation rate, and anisotropy. Using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group, we obtain a phase diagram that features broken-symmetry phases and topologically ordered quantum Hall states, while also highlighting the distinctive physics arising from the system's edges. Our results demonstrate the potential for future theoretical and experimental exploration of anisotropic quantum fluids, offering a unified framework for weakly interacting Bose condensates, vortex matter, and strongly correlated topological phases.

Title: Nonmonotonic diffusion in sheared active suspensions of squirmers
Authors: Zhouyang Ge, John F. Brady, Gwynn J. Elfring
Abstract: We investigate how shear influences the dynamics of active particles in dilute to concentrated suspensions. Specifically, we focus on apolar active suspensions of squirmers, which are individually immotile but display activity-induced hydrodynamic diffusion. Under shear, the instantaneous particle velocities fluctuate more rapidly, similar to passive suspensions; however, surprisingly, the long-time diffusive dynamics can slow down and exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on the shear rate. We show that this behavior arises from an interplay between the activity-induced persistent motion and shear-induced negative velocity autocorrelation, both of which are more pronounced at lower volume fractions. Simulations of self-propelled particles with tunable persistence support this explanation and further offer a simple mechanism to understand the observed coupling. Our results reveal a generic effect of shear on diffusion in active suspensions, elucidate how internal and external forcing interact, and provide new possibilities to modulate transport in active fluids.

Title: Natural layered phlogopite dielectric for ultrathin two-dimensional optoelectronics
Authors: Thomas Pucher, Julia Hernandez-Ruiz, Guillermo Tajuelo-Castilla, José Ángel Martín-Gago, Carmen Munuera, Andres Castellanos-Gomez
Abstract: The integration of high-dielectric-constant (high-$\kappa$) materials with two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is promising to overcome performance limitations and reach their full theoretical potential. Here we show that naturally occurring phlogopite mica, exfoliated into ultrathin flakes, can serve as a robust high-$\kappa$ dielectric layer for transition metal dichalcogenide-based 2D electronics and optoelectronics. Phlogopite's wide bandgap (~4.8 eV), high dielectric constant (~11), and large breakdown field (10 MVcm$^{-1}$) enable transistors with subthreshold swings down to 100 mVdec$^{-1}$, minimal hysteresis (30-60 mV) and interface trap densities comparable to state-of-the-art oxide dielectrics. Moreover, phototransistors built upon monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) and phlogopite exhibit responsivities up to 3.3x10$^{4}$ AW$^{-1}$ and detectivities near 10$^{10}$ Jones, surpassing devices based on conventional gate insulators. We further demonstrate the versatility of this natural dielectric by integrating phlogopite/MoS$_2$ heterostructures into NMOS inverters, showcasing robust voltage gains and low-voltage operation. Our findings establish phlogopite as a promising, earth-abundant dielectric for next-generation 2D transistor technologies and high-performance photodetection.

Title: Dynamics of charge states at the surface of a ferroelectric nanoparticle in a liquid crystal

Abstract: The liquid crystal with suspended ferroelectric nanoparticles is an interesting object for fundamental research of the long-range dipole-dipole interactions; as well as it is promising for optical, optoelectronic and electrochemical applications. Such suspensions can serve as basic elements for advanced nonvolatile memory cells and energy storage devices. The work studies the cells filled with a nematic liquid crystal 5CB and the cells containing 5CB with 0.5 wt.% and 1 wt.% of BaTiO3 nanoparticles with an average size of 24 nm. We analyzed the time dependences of the current flowing through the cells at constant applied voltage and the voltage dynamics in the no-load mode. The time dependences of the current and voltage show a slowing down decay rate. For the cells with BaTiO3 nanoparticles, the decrease in the decay time is characteristic. A possible physical reason for the retarding decay time rate is the indirect effect of screening charges, which cover ferroelectric nanoparticles, and slow ionic transport in the liquid crystal. To explain the dynamics of current and voltage, the finite element modeling of the polarization distribution, domain structure dynamics, and charge state of nanoparticles in a liquid crystal is performed using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach. Theoretical results confirmed the leading role of screening charges, because the surface of a ferroelectric nanoparticle adsorbs an ionic-electronic charge that partially screens its spontaneous polarization in single-domain and/or poly-domain states. When an electric field is applied to the liquid crystal with nanoparticles, it can release part of the screening charge (mainly due to the change in the polarization of the nanoparticle), which will lead to a decrease in decay time rate of the current and voltage dependences.

Title: Origin of local magnetic exchange interaction in infiite-layer nickelates
Authors: Yanbing Zhou, Dan Zhao, Boyun Zeng, Chengliang Xia, Yu Wang, Hanghui Chen, Tao Wu, Xianhui Chen
Abstract: Significant magnetic exchange interactions have been observed in infinite-layer nickelates RNiO2 (R = La, Pr, Nd), which exhibit unconventional superconductivity upon hole doping. Despite their structural and Fermi surface similarities to cuprates, infinite-layer nickelates possess a larger charge transfer gap, which influences their magnetic exchange interactions via oxygen. In this work, we performed 17O nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on LaNiO2 and Sr-doped LaNiO2, revealing glassy spin dynamics originating from Ni-O planes. This indicates that infinite-layer nickelates are in proximity to magnetic ordering and that magnetic correlations play a crucial role in their physics. More importantly, our analysis of the Knight shift and hyperfine coupling of 17O nuclei revealed that the Ni-Ni superexchange interaction, mediated by the {\sigma} bond between the Ni-dx2-y2 and O-p orbitals, is one order of magnitude weaker than that in cuprates. This alone cannot account for the total magnetic exchange interaction observed in nickelates. First-principles many-body calculations indicate that an interstitial s orbital near the Fermi level, coupled with the Ni-d3z2-r2 orbital, significantly enhances the superexchange interaction. This contrasts with cuprates, where magnetic interactions are predominantly governed by Cu-dx2-y2 superexchange via oxygen. Our findings provide new insights into the distinct magnetic interactions in infinite-layer nickelates and their potential role in unconventional superconductivity.

Title: Glassy dynamics and a growing structural length scale in supercooled nanoparticles
Authors: Weikai Qi, Shreya Tiwary, Richard K. Bowles
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics simulation to study the relationship between structure and dynamics in supercooled binary Lennard--Jones nanoparticles over a range of particle sizes. The glass transition temperature of the nanoparticles is found to be significantly lowered relative to the bulk, decreasing as $N^{-1/3}$ with decreasing particle size. This allows the nanoparticles to sample low energy states on the potential energy landscape and we are able to study their relaxation times, measured in terms of the intermediate scattering function, and their structure, measured in terms of locally favoured structures, to low temperatures. Our work shows that the growing relaxation times in the supercooled nanoparticles are coupled with the growth of physical clusters formed from favoured local structures in a way that is well described by the Random First Order Transition entropic droplet model, but with exponents that are dependent on the nanoparticle size.

Title: Universal or not: Domain walls in inhomogeneous asymmetric exclusion processes with finite resources
Authors: Sourav Pal, Abhik Basu
Abstract: We study the domain walls (DW) in an asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) with finite resources and a bottleneck. For large values of $\alpha,\,\beta$, which parametrize the entry and exit rates of the TASEP lane, and with {sufficiently large} resources, the DWs are independent of these parameters, revealing a {\em hitherto unknown universality}. Unusually, these are accompanied by boundary layers in the TASEP lane. These universal DWs replace the maximal current phases in TASEPs. For smaller values of $\alpha,\,\beta$, the DWs depend upon them, and hence are nonuniversal. Our studies show that both universal and nonuniversal DWs can appear for reservoirs with finite or unlimited capacity.

Title: Transients and multiperiodic responses: a hierarchy of material bits
Authors: Colin M. Meulblok, Martin van Hecke
Abstract: When cyclically driven, certain disordered materials exhibit transient and multiperiodic responses that are difficult to reproduce in synthetic materials. Here, we show that elementary multiperiodic elements with period T=2, togglerons, can serve as building blocks for such responses. We experimentally realize metamaterials composed of togglerons with tunable transients and periodic responses - including odd periods. Our approach suggests a hierarchy of increasingly complex elements in frustrated media, and opens a new strategy for rational design of sequential metamaterials.

Title: Experimental demonstration of an analogy between optical non-coherence and irreversibility of heat transport
Authors: Aleksandr Meilakhs, Claudio Pastorino, Miguel Larotonda
Abstract: We probe experimentally a connection between coherence in the context of optical physics and the irreversibility present in heat transfer through an interface separating two media. The robustness of the experiment on the one hand, and the theoretical description taken from the statistical-mechanics treatment of the heat transfer problem, on the other hand, allows for the study of the arrow of time's problem within the clean and precise framework of experimental optical physics. The central aspect of the experiment is a light beam incident and split at an interface to produce a second common interaction point again at the interface. The experiment was carried out with two light sources that only differ in their coherence length. In the case of the highly coherent light source, we were able to combine the previously split parts of the light back into a single beam. This is indicative of the reversibility of the process of coherent light transmission through the interface. The light source with low coherence length, on the contrary, does not allow for such a recombination, thus producing an irreversible process. We explain how the latter case is analogous to the process of interfacial heat transport, thus establishing an important connection between optical non-coherence and irreversibility of transport phenomena. Our finding paves the way for the study of fundamental processes in heat transfer and the surge of irreversibility in the realm of optical physics.

Title: Mechanical work extraction from an error-prone active dynamic Szilard engine
Authors: Luca Cocconi, Paolo Malgaretti, Holger Stark
Abstract: Isothermal information engines operate by extracting net work from a single heat bath through measurement and feedback control. In this work, we analyze a realistic active Szilard engine operating on a single active particle by means of steric interaction with an externally controlled mechanical element. In particular, we provide a comprehensive study of how finite measurement accuracy affects the engine's work and power output, as well as the cost of operation. Having established the existence of non-trivial optima for work and power output, we study the dependence of their loci on the measurement error parameters and identify conditions for their positivity under one-shot and cyclic engine operation. By computing a suitably defined information efficiency, we also demonstrate that this engine design allows for the violation of Landauer's bound on the efficiency of information-to-work conversion. Notably, the information efficiency for one-shot operation exhibits a discontinuous transition and a non-monotonic dependence on the measurement precision. Finally, we show that cyclic operation improves information efficiency by harvesting residual mutual information between successive measurements.

Title: Super Gaussian Self-Consistent method for systems with a two-body Hamiltonian
Authors: Edward G. Timoshenko
Abstract: A new kinetic self-consistent method is presented based on the proposed Gaussian Superposition Principle for computation of ensemble averaged observables of a macromolecule interacting via two-body forces. The latter leads to the derivation of a natural functional closure relation for the 3-point distribution functions (DF), thereby truncating a hierarchy of kinetic equations obtained from the original Langevin equation. The resulting Super Gaussian Self-Consistent (SGSC) equations for the 2-point distribution functions acquire a sufficiently tractable integro-differential form. The SGSC theory strives to yield realistic shapes of various distribution functions for any macromolecule with a generic Hamiltonian involving 2-body interaction potentials, both at equilibrium and during kinetics.

Title: Unconventional magnetic glassiness in non-centrosymmetric Sm$_7$Pd$_3$: Interplay of magnetic frustration, long-range order, and frozen domains
Authors: Ajay Kumar, Anis Biswas, Yaroslav Mudryk
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the intricate spin dynamics in the non-centrosymmetric compound Sm$_7$Pd$_3$, revealing the coexistence of spin glass, domain glass, and ferromagnetic (FM) behaviors. Magnetic field-dependent measurements indicate large coercivity, suggesting ferromagnetic domain formation below the Curie temperature ($T_C \sim 173$ K), while temperature-dependent magnetization data point to antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling, highlighting the competition between FM and AFM interactions. Detailed ac susceptibility, isothermal remanent magnetization, and aging effect measurements demonstrate the presence of two distinct types of glassiness in the sample, and their possible origins are discussed extensively. Magnetization measurements reveal the mixing of the J = 5/2 ground state of Sm$^{3+}$ with the excited J = 7/2 multiplet, lying 965 K above. The specific heat data show further crystalline electric field splitting of the J = 5/2 state into a ground-state doublet and a fourfold-degenerate excited state.

Title: Learned Free-Energy Functionals from Pair-Correlation Matching for Dynamical Density Functional Theory
Authors: Karnik Ram, Jacobus Dijkman, René van Roij, Jan-Willem Van de Meent, Bernd Ensing, Max Welling, Daniel Cremers
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (cDFT) and dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) are modern statistical mechanical theories for modelling many-body colloidal systems at the one-body density level. The theories hinge on knowing the excess free-energy accurately, which is however not feasible for most practical applications. Dijkman et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056103 (2025)] recently showed how a neural excess free-energy functional for cDFT can be learned from inexpensive bulk simulations via pair-correlation matching. In this Letter, we demonstrate how this same functional can be applied to DDFT, without any retraining, to simulate non-equilibrium overdamped dynamics of inhomogeneous densities. We evaluate this on a 3D Lennard-Jones system with planar geometry under various complex external potentials and observe good agreement of the dynamical densities with those from expensive Brownian dynamic simulations, up to the limit of the adiabatic approximation. We further develop and apply an extension of DDFT to a grand-canonical system modeled after breakthrough gas adsorption studies, finding similarly good agreement. Our results demonstrate a practical route for leveraging learned free-energy functionals in DDFT, paving the way for accurate and efficient modeling of non-equilibrium systems.

Title: Bulk superinsulation and polar nematic order in nanopatterned NbTiN
Authors: A. Yu. Mironov, C. A. Trugenberger, M. C. Diamantini, D. A. Nasimov, V. M. Vinokur
Abstract: We present an experimental evidence of 3D superinsulation in a nanopatterned slab of NbTiN, given by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) scaling of the conductance when approaching the critical temperature from above and by the vanishing of the conductance below the transition. In the electric Meissner state, we find polar nematic order arising from ferroelectric alignement of short electric strings excited by external electromagnetic fields. Our results prove that superinsulation appears also in ordered structures provided that these are large enough, thereby confirming the origin of superinsulation as electric confinement, independent of disorder.

Title: Phase domain walls in coherently driven Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: S. S. Gavrilov
Abstract: We consider coherent states of weakly interacting bosons under the conditions of external resonant excitation, with a focus on a two-dimensional polariton fluid driven by a plane electromagnetic wave near the ground state. The coherent driving breaks the U(1) symmetry explicitly, which prevents the occurrence of quantum vortices in a uniform scalar condensate. Surprisingly, a spinor (two-component) system of the same kind admits topological excitations, such as domain walls of relative phase or confined half-vortex molecules, typical of a freely evolving spinor Bose system. Opposite-phase domains arise from the spontaneous breakdown of the spin symmetry $(\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Domain walls form with time even when the initial state of the system is uniform or completely disordered; they fall into different topological types distinguished by the total phase variation in the transverse direction.

Title: Long-tailed dissipationless hydromechanics: weak thermalization and ergodicity breaking
Authors: Giuseppe Procopio, Chiara Pezzotti, Massimiliano Giona
Abstract: We analyze the dynamic properties of dissipationless Generalized Langevin Equations in the presence of fluid inertial kernels possessing power-law tails, $k(t) \sim t^{-\kappa}$. While for $\kappa >1$ the dynamics is manifestly non ergodic, no thermalization occurs, and particle motion is ballistic, new phenomena arise for $0 < \kappa <1$. In this case, a form of weak thermalization appears in the presence of thermal/hydrodynamic fluctuations and attractive potentials. However, the absence of dissipation clearly emerges once an external constant force is applied: an asymptotic settling velocity cannot be achieved as the expected value of the particle velocity diverges.

Title: Analytical and Scale-Free Phase-Field Studies of $α$ to $ω$ Phase Transformation in Single Crystal Zirconium under Nonhydrostatic Loadings
Authors: Raghunandan Pratoori, Hamed Babaei, Valery I. Levitas
Abstract: Zirconium (Zr) is an important engineering material with numerous practical applications. It undergoes martensitic $\alpha$ to $\omega$ phase transformation (PT) at pressures that vary from 0.67 GPa to 17 GPa under different loading conditions. Despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies, the effect of the nonhydrostatic stresses is not well understood. To separate the effect of nonhydrostatic stresses from the plastic deformation, a scale-free phase field approach (PFA) for multivariant $\alpha$ to $\omega$ PT in a single crystal Zr under general nonhydrostatic loadings is presented. Explicit conditions for the direct and reverse PTs between austenite and martensitic variants and between martensitic variants under general stress tensor are derived and analyzed. In particular, the effect of the deviatoric stresses on the PT pressures is elucidated. It is shown that their effect cannot explain much larger reduction in the transformation pressure observed during plastic flow, i.e., specific mechanisms of strain-induced phase transformations should be involved. Under assumption of the homogeneous fields in the sample, complete analytical solutions that include stress-strain curves during the PT, PT start and finish stresses (i.e., stress hysteresis), and volume fraction of the variants, are determined for different loadings. Finite element method (FEM) solutions are found for the phase field simulations of the microstructure evolution for the same loadings, as well as for two grains of the polycrystalline sample. Macroscopic averaged characteristics of the PFA solutions are well described by an analytical solution, which also simplifies their interpretations. Obtained results are in good qualitative agreement with existing experiments. In addition, some controversies of the previous approaches are analysed.

Title: Al$_2$MnCu: A magnetically ordered member of the Heusler alloy family despite having a valence electron count of 24
Authors: Soumya Bhowmik, Santanu Pakhira, Renu Choudhary, Ravi Kumar, Rajashri Urkude, Biplab Ghosh, D. Bhattacharyya, Maxim Avdeev, Chandan Mazumdar
Abstract: The magnetic property of the Heusler alloys can be predicted by the famous Slater-Pauling (S-P) rule, which states the total magnetic moment ($m_t$) of such materials can be expressed as $m _t\,=\,(N_V-24)\,\mu_B/f.u.$, where $N_V$ is the total valence electron count (VEC). Consequently, no Heusler alloys having VEC = 24 are theoretically expected as well as experimentally reported to have any magnetic ordering. Recently, a special class of Heusler alloys with 50\% concentration of $p$-block elements (anti-Heusler) have been identified, although none of such reported compounds belong to the VEC 24 category. Here, we report a new anti-Heusler alloy, Al$_2$MnCu, that undergoes long-range ferromagnetic (FM) ordering with $T_{\rm C}\sim$315 K and a large magnetic moment of $\sim$1.8 $\mu_B$/f.u. despite having VEC 24. A phenomenological model based on molecular orbital hybridization is also proposed to understand the magnetism and unusual deviation from the standard S-P rule.

Title: Three regimes of a picosecond magnetoacoustics in ferromagnetic structures
Authors: P. I. Gerevenkov, Ia. A. Mogunov, Ia. A. Filatov, N. S. Gusev, M. V. Sapozhnikov, N. E. Khokhlov, A. M. Kalashnikova
Abstract: The development of magnonic devices requires energy-efficient methods for generating spin waves and controlling their parameters. Acoustic waves are known to excite spin waves resonantly with magneto-elastic wave formation or to drive non-resonantly forced magnetization oscillations. Short acoustic wavevpackets enable another resonant interaction regime - Cherenkov radiation of spin waves. This poses a question on the criteria and signatures of transitions between these three regimes of a picosecond magnetoacoustic. Here, we use the scanning magneto-optical pump-probe technique to directly reveal all three regimes of interactions of laser-driven acoustic and magnetostatic wave packets in a thin permalloy film and a waveguide on top of a (011)-Si substrate. Direct measurements of the phase velocities revealed the transition from coupled magneto-elastic wavepacket to Cherenkov-like radiation and non-resonant regime controlled by the detuning between magnon and phonon group velocities. Acoustic pulse is found to be affected by the excited magnetization dynamics only in the magneto-elastic regime.

Title: On-surface Synthesis of a Ferromagnetic Molecular Spin Trimer

Abstract: Triangulenes are prototypical examples of open-shell nanographenes. Their magnetic properties, arising from the presence of unpaired $\pi$ electrons, can be extensively tuned by modifying their size and shape or by introducing heteroatoms. Different triangulene derivatives have been designed and synthesized in recent years, thanks to the development of on-surface synthesis strategies. Triangulene-based nanostructures with polyradical character, hosting several interacting spin units, can be challenging to fabricate but are particularly interesting for potential applications in carbon-based spintronics. Here, we combine pristine and N-doped triangulenes into a more complex nanographene, \textbf{TTAT}, predicted to possess three unpaired $\pi$ electrons delocalized along the zigzag periphery. We generate the molecule on an Au(111) surface and detect direct fingerprints of multi-radical coupling and high-spin state using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. With the support of theoretical calculations, we show that its three radical units are localized at distinct parts of the molecule and couple via symmetric ferromagnetic interactions, which result in a $S=3/2$ ground state, thus demonstrating the realization of a molecular ferromagnetic Heisenberg-like spin trimer

Title: Comparative Analysis of GFN Methods in Geometry Optimization of Small Organic Semiconductor Molecules: A DFT Benchmarking Study
Authors: Steve Cabrel Teguia Kouam, Jean-Pierre Tchapet Njafa, Raoult Dabou Teukam, Patrick Mvoto Kongo, Jean-Pierre Nguenang, Serge Guy Nana Engo
Abstract: This study benchmarks the geometric, frequency, non-covalent (GFN) semi-empirical methods, GFN1-xTB, GFN2-xTB, GFN0-xTB, and GFN-FF, against density functional theory (DFT) for the geometry optimization of small organic semiconductor molecules. Two datasets are evaluated: a QM9-derived subset of small organic molecules and the Harvard Clean Energy Project (CEP) database of extended $\pi$-systems relevant to organic photovoltaics. Structural agreement is quantified using heavy-atom RMSD, equilibrium rotational constants, bond lengths, angles, and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps. Computational efficiency is assessed via CPU time and scaling behavior. GFN1-xTB and GFN2-xTB demonstrate the highest structural fidelity, while GFN-FF offers an optimal balance between accuracy and speed, particularly for larger systems. The results indicate that GFN-based methods are suitable for high-throughput molecular screening of small organic semiconductors, the choice of the method depending on the accuracy-cost trade-offs. The findings support the deployment of GFN approaches in computational pipelines for the discovery of organic electronics and materials, providing information on their strengths and limitations relative to established DFT methods.

Title: Exchange-driven giant magnetoelastic coupling in Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$
Authors: Carolina A. Marques, Luke C. Rhodes, Weronika Osmolska, Harry Lane, Izidor Benedičič, Masahiro Naritsuka, Rosalba Fittipaldi, Mariateresa Lettieri, Antonio Vecchione, Peter Wahl
Abstract: The interplay of electronic and structural degrees of freedom is at the heart of some of the most astonishing phenomena found in condensed matter physics, for example, the condensation of electron pairs into a macroscopically coherent ground state in superconductors. In magnetic materials, magnetic interactions couple to lattice degrees of freedom resulting in magnetoelastic coupling - an effect that is typically small and only detectable on macroscopic samples. Here, we demonstrate giant magnetoelastic coupling in the correlated itinerant ferromagnet Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$. We establish control of the magnetism in the surface layer and use this control to probe the impact of the magnetism on its electronic and structural properties. By using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we reveal subtle changes in the electronic structure dependent on ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic alignment between the surface and subsurface layers. We determine the consequences of the exchange force on the relaxation of the surface layer, exhibiting a giant magnetostriction. Our results provide a direct measurement of the impact of exchange interactions and correlations on structural details in a quantum material, reveal how electronic correlations result in strong electron-lattice coupling and establish Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$ as a system to study magnetism in 2D.

Title: Increasing the Hardness of Posiform Planting Using Random QUBOs for Programmable Quantum Annealer Benchmarking
Authors: Elijah Pelofske, Georg Hahn, Hristo Djidjev
Abstract: Posiform planting is a method for constructing QUBO problems with a single unique planted solution that can be tailored to arbitrary connectivity graphs. In this study we investigate making posiform planted QUBOs computationally harder by fusing many smaller random discrete coefficient spin-glass Ising models, whose global minimum energy is computed classically using classical binary integer programming optimization software, with posiform-planted QUBOs. The single unique ground-state solution of the resulting QUBO problem is the concatenation of (exactly one of) the ground-states of each of the smaller problems. We apply these modified posiform planted QUBOs to the task of benchmarking programmable D-Wave quantum annealers. The proposed method enables generating binary variable combinatorial optimization problems that cover the entire quantum annealing processor hardware graph, have a unique solution, are entirely hardware-graph-native, and can have tunable computational hardness. We benchmark the capabilities of three D-Wave superconducting qubit quantum annealing processors, having from 563 up to 5627 qubits, to sample the optimal unique planted solution of problems generated by our proposed method and compare them against simulated annealing and Gurobi. We find that the D-Wave QPU ground-state sampling success rate does not change with respect to the size of the random QUBOs we employ. Surprisingly, we find that some of these classes of QUBOs are solved at very high success rates at short annealing times compared to longer annealing times for the Zephyr connectivity graph QPUs.

Title: Biased Degenerate Ground-State Sampling of Small Ising Models with Converged QAOA
Authors: Elijah Pelofske
Abstract: The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, a generalization of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), is a quantum algorithm used for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA typically uses the Transverse field mixer as the driving Hamiltonian. One of the interesting properties of the Transverse-field driving Hamiltonian is that it results in non-uniform sampling of degenerate ground states of optimization problems. In this study we numerically examine the fair sampling properties transverse field mixer QAOA, and Grover Mixer QAOA (GM-QAOA) which provides theoretical guarantees of fair sampling of degenerate optimal solutions, up to large enough p such that the mean expectation value converges to an optimal approximation ratio of 1. This comparison is performed with high quality heuristically computed, but not necessarily optimal, QAOA angles which give strictly monotonically improving solution quality as p increases. These angles are computed using the Julia based numerical simulation software JuliQAOA. Fair sampling of degenerate ground-states is quantified using Shannon entropy of the ground-state amplitudes distribution. The fair sampling properties are reported on several quantum signature Hamiltonians from previous quantum annealing fair sampling studies. Small random fully connected spin glasses are shown which exhibit exponential suppression of some degenerate ground-states with transverse field mixer QAOA. The transverse field mixer QAOA simulations show that some problem instances clearly saturate the Shannon entropy of 0 with a maximally biased distribution that occurs when the learning converges to an approximation ratio of 1 while other problem instances never deviate from a maximum Shannon entropy (uniform distribution) at any p step.

Title: Emerging axion detection in artificial magnetoelectric materials
Authors: Runyu Lei, Chen-Hui Xie, Jiayi Liu, Zhong Liu, Xin Liu, Yu Gao, Sichun Sun, Jinxing Zhang
Abstract: The origin of dark matter is a fundamental problem in physics. Axions are considered a key component of dark matter, characterized by very weak Chern-Simons couplings to electromagnetism, gravity, and fermions. We propose a novel symmetry-breaking detection mechanism in magnetoelectric materials, allowing for a linear axionic coupling between magnetism and ferroelectric polarization. We focus on strain gradient Sr2IrO4, where the breaking of space-inversion symmetry results in an emergent polar phase and out-of-plane magnetic moment, exhibiting a flexomagnetoelectric effect. In this material, the linear P||M enables direct coupling between the external axion field and the intrinsic axion-like field within the material. This mechanism amplifies the weak electromagnetic signals induced by axions, paving the way for pioneering axion detection. These signals can be detected by monitoring changes in macroscopic physical quantities, such as the magnetoelectric and magnetic responses. In contrast to conventional detection techniques, this mechanism significantly enhances the sensitivity of the axion-electron and axion-photon coupling, providing a novel platform for axion detection and advancing the study of dark matter through the magnetoelectric effect.

Title: Enhanced Performance of Highly Activated Carbon and Surface-Treated Porous Polymers as Physical Adsorbents for Chemical Warfare Agents
Authors: Sanghyeon Park, Yuseung Hong, Hyunseo Choi
Abstract: The use of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) in modern warfare cannot be disregarded due to their ease of use and potential for large-scale incapacitation. An effective countermeasure involves the physical adsorption of these agents, preventing their entry through the respiratory tract by non-specific adsorption. In this study, we investigate the physical interaction between potential adsorbents and model gases mimicking CWAs, thereby identifying sufficient conditions for higher physical adsorption performance. Our findings reveal that the physical adsorption capacity is highly sensitive to the surface properties of the adsorbents, with uniform development of micropores, rather than solely high surface area, emerging as a critical factor. Additionally, we identified the potential of porous organic polymers as promising alternatives to conventional activated carbon-based adsorbents. Through a facile introduction of polar sulfone functional groups on the polymer surface, we demonstrated that these polar surface polymers exhibit physical adsorption capabilities for formaldehyde under ambient conditions comparable to high-performance activated carbons. Notably, the superior activated carbon possessed a high BET surface area of 2400 m^2/g and an exceptionally uniform micropore structure with an average pore size of approximately 11 Angstroms. This research paves the way for designing adsorbents with high physical adsorption capacities tailored for CWAs protection, offering a significant advancement in developing next-generation protective materials.

Title: Total Variation-Based Image Decomposition and Denoising for Microscopy Images
Authors: Marco Corrias, Giada Franceschi, Michele Riva, Alberto Tampieri, Karin Föttinger, Ulrike Diebold, Thomas Pock, Cesare Franchini
Abstract: Experimentally acquired microscopy images are unavoidably affected by the presence of noise and other unwanted signals, which degrade their quality and might hide relevant features. With the recent increase in image acquisition rate, modern denoising and restoration solutions become necessary. This study focuses on image decomposition and denoising of microscopy images through a workflow based on total variation (TV), addressing images obtained from various microscopy techniques, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our approach consists in restoring an image by extracting its unwanted signal components and subtracting them from the raw one, or by denoising it. We evaluate the performance of TV-$L^1$, Huber-ROF, and TGV-$L^1$ in achieving this goal in distinct study cases. Huber-ROF proved to be the most flexible one, while TGV-$L^1$ is the most suitable for denoising. Our results suggest a wider applicability of this method in microscopy, restricted not only to STM, AFM, and SEM images. The Python code used for this study is publicly available as part of AiSurf. It is designed to be integrated into experimental workflows for image acquisition or can be used to denoise previously acquired images.

Title: High-throughput Screening of the Mechanical Properties of Peptide Assemblies
Authors: Sarah K. Yorke, Zhenze Yang, Aviad Levin, Alice Ray, Jeremy Owusu Boamah, Tuomas P. J. Knowles, Markus J. Buehler
Abstract: Peptides are recognized for their varied self-assembly behaviors, forming a wide array of structures and geometries, such as spheres, fibers, and hydrogels, each presenting a unique set of material properties. The functionalities of these materials hold exceptional interest for applications in biology, medicine, photonics, nanotechnology and the food industry. In specific, the ability to exploit peptides as viable and sustainable mechanical materials requires sequence design that enables superior performance, notably a high Young's modulus. As the peptide sequence space is vast, however, even a slight increase in sequence length leads to an exponential increase in the number of potential peptide sequences to be characterized. Here, we combine coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, atomic force microscopy experiments and machine learning models to correlate the sequence length and composition with the mechanical properties of self-assembled peptides. We calculate the Young's modulus for all possible amino acid sequences of di- and tripeptides using high-throughput coarse-grained methods, and validate these calculations through in-situ mechanical characterization. For pentapeptides, we select and calculate properties for a subset of sequences to train a machine learning model, which allows us to predict the modulus for other sequences. The combined workflow not only identifies promising peptide candidates with exceptional mechanical performances, but also extends current understanding of the sequence-to-function relationships for peptide materials, for specific applications.

Title: The Migdal effect in solid crystals and the role of non-adiabaticity
Authors: Angelo Esposito, Andrea Rocchi
Abstract: We systematically apply the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to show that the Migdal effect in a solid crystal is entirely due to non-adiabatic effects, namely the deviation of the wave function from exact factorization of the electronic and nuclear contributions. The matrix element obtained this way matches exactly the result found by means of a previously derived low energy effective theory.

Title: Symmetry properties of pair correlations in heavy deformed nuclei
Authors: G. Palkanoglou, A. Gezerlis
Abstract: Nucleons are known to form pairing correlations with various types of spin-symmetries. Spin-singlet neutron-neutron and proton-proton pairing is abundant in the nuclear chart but spin-triplet and mixed-spin proton-neutron pairing correlations have also been predicted to form at least in the ground states of certain nuclei. A realistic candidate region is that of the lightest Lanthanides where it was recently demonstrated that the nuclear deformation expected to emerge enhances spin-triplet pairing correlations. In this paper we provide the details of the deformed multimodal Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov theory that lead to this conclusion, as well as the details of the effects identified. We present in detail the response of different pairing correlations to various deformation modes and calculate their signatures in the odd-even staggering of masses. This paper provides a detailed discussion, and some resolutions, on the long-standing question ``what is the effect of nuclear deformation on the various pairing correlations?''

Title: An Analytical Characterization of Sloppiness in Neural Networks: Insights from Linear Models
Authors: Jialin Mao, Itay Griniasty, Yan Sun, Mark K. Transtrum, James P. Sethna, Pratik Chaudhari
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that training trajectories of multiple deep neural networks with different architectures, optimization algorithms, hyper-parameter settings, and regularization methods evolve on a remarkably low-dimensional "hyper-ribbon-like" manifold in the space of probability distributions. Inspired by the similarities in the training trajectories of deep networks and linear networks, we analytically characterize this phenomenon for the latter. We show, using tools in dynamical systems theory, that the geometry of this low-dimensional manifold is controlled by (i) the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix of the training data, (ii) the relative scale of the ground-truth output to the weights at the beginning of training, and (iii) the number of steps of gradient descent. By analytically computing and bounding the contributions of these quantities, we characterize phase boundaries of the region where hyper-ribbons are to be expected. We also extend our analysis to kernel machines and linear models that are trained with stochastic gradient descent.

Title: Spectral Gap Bounds for Quantum Markov Semigroups via Correlation Decay
Authors: Angelo Lucia, David Pérez-García, Antonio Pérez-Hernández
Abstract: Starting from an arbitrary full-rank state of a lattice quantum spin system, we define a "canonical purified Hamiltonian" and characterize its spectral gap in terms of a spatial mixing condition (or correlation decay) of the state. When the state considered is a Gibbs state of a local, commuting Hamiltonian at positive temperature, we show that the spectral gap of the canonical purified Hamiltonian provides a lower bound to the spectral gap of a large class of reversible generators of quantum Markov semigroup, including local and ergodic Davies generators. As an application of our construction, we show that the mixing condition is always satisfied for any finite-range 1D model, as well as by Kitaev's quantum double models.

Title: Quantum dynamics in frustrated Ising fullerenes
Authors: Alejandro Lopez-Bezanilla, William Bernoudy, Kelly Boothby, Jack Raymond, Alberto Nocera, Andrew D. King
Abstract: The complex energy landscapes exhibited by frustrated magnetic systems undergoing quantum fluctuations are a challenge to accurately simulate, and thus of great interest for testing diverse qubit platforms in the field of quantum simulation. This study experimentally demonstrates quantum fluctuations lifting the degenerate ground-state manifold of classical magnetic configurations in fullerene Ising models with resonating dimers. The interplay between degeneracy and quantum fluctuations makes these boundary-free models a suitable benchmark for quantum simulators. Indeed, we observe significant performance improvement across generations of superconducting quantum annealers, showing the potential of highly symmetric, frustrated systems for assessing the precision of quantum-simulation technologies.

Title: Discrete time quasi-crystal in Rydberg atomic chain
Authors: Xiaofan Luo, Yaoting Zhou, Zhongxiao Xu, Weilun Jiang
Abstract: Discrete time quasi-crystals are non-equilibrium quantum phenomena with quasi-periodic order in the time dimension, and are an extension of the discrete time-crystal phase. As a natural platform to explore the non-equilibrium phase of matter, the Rydberg atomic array has implemented the quantum simulation of the discrete-time crystal phase, associated with quantum many-body scar state. However, the existence of discrete time quasi-crystal on the Rydberg cold atom experiment platform has yet to be conceived. Here, we propose a method to generate the discrete time quasi-crystal behavior by coupling two discrete time-crystals, where associated two external driving frequencies have the maximum incommensurability. While we analysis its robustness and compute the phase diagram of corresponding observables. We significantly calculate the entanglement entropy between two parts of the system. Remarkably, we find the emergence of the aperiodic response is indeed caused by interaction between systems via Rydberg blockade effect. Our method thus offers the possibilities to explore the novel phases in quantum simulator.

Title: Spatial Offset of Excited States in Non-Hermitian Lattices
Authors: Xiaohan Jiang, Yuanyuan Pan, Yang Zhang, Ye Xiong
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of light-wave packets injected into non-Hermitian microcavity lattices under highly dissipative conditions. While all eigenstates of the lattice exhibit exponential decay, a specifically excited state maintains coherent propagation. In a one-dimensional lattice, this state undergoes a spatial displacement shift away from the injection position, which is a fundamental property of non-Hermitian systems with a point gap when the spectrum encircles a finite region in the complex plane. Extending such a shift to two-dimensional lattices reveals a geometrically anomalous V-shaped wave packet formation with orientation-tunable arms. Notably, this geometric control mechanism enables all-optical steering of non-Hermitian photonic states without requiring structural modifications.

Title: Quotient Complex Transformer (QCformer) for Perovskite Data Analysis
Authors: Xinyu You, Xiang Liu, Chuan-Shen Hu, Kelin Xia, Tze Chien Sum
Abstract: The discovery of novel functional materials is crucial in addressing the challenges of sustainable energy generation and climate change. Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have gained attention for their exceptional optoelectronic properties in photovoltaics. Recently, geometric deep learning, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown strong potential in predicting material properties and guiding material design. However, traditional GNNs often struggle to capture the periodic structures and higher-order interactions prevalent in such systems. To address these limitations, we propose a novel representation based on quotient complexes (QCs) and introduce the Quotient Complex Transformer (QCformer) for material property prediction. A material structure is modeled as a quotient complex, which encodes both pairwise and many-body interactions via simplices of varying dimensions and captures material periodicity through a quotient operation. Our model leverages higher-order features defined on simplices and processes them using a simplex-based Transformer module. We pretrain QCformer on benchmark datasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS, and fine-tune it on HOIP datasets. The results show that QCformer outperforms state-of-the-art models in HOIP property prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness. The quotient complex representation and QCformer model together contribute a powerful new tool for predictive modeling of perovskite materials.

Title: Optimal randomized measurements for a family of non-linear quantum properties
Authors: Zhenyu Du, Yifan Tang, Andreas Elben, Ingo Roth, Jens Eisert, Zhenhuan Liu
Abstract: Quantum learning encounters fundamental challenges when estimating non-linear properties, owing to the inherent linearity of quantum mechanics. Although recent advances in single-copy randomized measurement protocols have achieved optimal sample complexity for specific tasks like state purity estimation, generalizing these protocols to estimate broader classes of non-linear properties without sacrificing optimality remains an open problem. In this work, we introduce the observable-driven randomized measurement (ORM) protocol enabling the estimation of ${\rm Tr}(O\rho^2)$ for an arbitrary observable $O$ -- an essential quantity in quantum computing and many-body physics. ORM achieves this by decomposing the observable $O$ into dichotomic observables and extracting the information of each eigenspace through randomized measurements with block-diagonal unitaries. We establish an upper bound for ORM's sample complexity and prove its optimality for all Pauli observables, closing a gap in the literature. Furthermore, we develop simplified variants of ORM for local Pauli observables and introduce a braiding randomized measurement protocol for fidelity estimation, both of which significantly reduce circuit complexities in practical applications. Numerical experiments validate that ORM requires substantially fewer state samples to achieve the same precision compared to classical shadows.

Title: Disentanglement-induced superconductivity
Authors: Eyal Buks
Abstract: The current study is motivated by a difficulty to reconcile between particle number conservation and superconductivity. An alternative modeling, which is based on the hypothesis that disentanglement spontaneously ocuurs in quantum systems, is explored. The Fermi-Hubbard mode is employed to demonstrate a disentanglement-induced quantum phase transition into a state having a finite superconducting order parameter. Moreover, the effect of disentanglement on Josephson junction's current phase relation is explored.

Title: Remarkable universalities in distributions of dynamical observables in chaotic systems
Authors: Lucianno Defaveri, Naftali R. Smith
Abstract: The study of chaotic systems, where rare events play a pivotal role, is essential for understanding complex dynamics due to their sensitivity to initial conditions. Recently, tools from large deviation theory, typically applied in the context of stochastic processes, have been used in the study of chaotic systems. Here, we study dynamical observables, $A = \sum_{n=1}^N g(\textbf{x}_n)$, defined along a chaotic trajectory $\{\textbf{x}_1, \textbf{x}_2, \ldots, \textbf{x}_N\}$. For most choices of $g(\textbf{x})$, $A$ satisfies a central limit theorem: At large sequence size $N \gg 1$, typical fluctuations of $A$ follow a Gaussian distribution with a variance that scales linearly with $N$. Large deviations of $A$ are usually described by the large deviation principle, that is, $P(A) \sim e^{- N I(A/N)}$, where $I(a)$ is the rate function. We find that certain dynamical observables exhibit a remarkable statistical universality: even when constructed with distinct functions $g_1(\textbf{x})$ and $g_2(\textbf{x})$, different observables are described by the same rate function. We provide a physical interpretation for this striking universality by showing that $g_1(\textbf{x})-g_2(\textbf{x})$ belongs to a class of functions that we call ``derived''. Furthermore, we show that if $g(\textbf{x})$ itself is ``derived'', then the distribution of $A$ becomes independent of $N$ in the large-$N$ limit, and is generally non-Gaussian (although it is mirror-symmetric). We demonstrate that the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) for the logistic map is of this derived form, thus providing a simple explanation for some existing results.

Title: Enhanced Spin Pumping and Magnetization dynamics in Ni80Fe20/MoS2 stack via interface modification
Authors: Mahammad Tahir, Somya Diwakar, Subhakanta Das, Mukul Gupta, Rohit Medwal, Soumik Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: Materials with strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) are essential for realizing spin orbit torque (SOT) based magnetic memory devices. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for such appli cations because of their inherently high SOC strength. In this study, we investigate the spin pumping effect at the interface between a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide (ML-MoS2) and Ni80Fe20 (Py) thin films using broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. FMR measurements reveal a notable enhancement in the effective Gilbert damping factor for the ML-MoS2/Py (Pt = 0 nm) interface compared to the reference Py thin films, attributed to spin pumping across the ML-MoS2/Py interface. To further quantify spin pumping efficiency, we introduce a high SOC platinum (Pt) interlayer at the ML-MoS2/Py interface and systematically vary its thickness. This allows us to evaluate key spin transport parameters, including the enhancement in the effective Gilbert damping parameter, the effective spin mixing conductance that reflects the transfer of spin angular momentum from Py to ML-MoS2 and the effective spin current density.

Title: High-Fidelity Control of a Strongly Coupled Electro-Nuclear Spin-Photon Interface

Abstract: Long distance quantum networking requires combining efficient spin-photon interfaces with long-lived local memories. Group-IV color centers in diamond (SiV, GeV, and SnV) are promising candidates for this application, containing an electronic spin-photon interface and dopant nuclear spin memory. Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in spin-photon coupling and spin-spin entanglement. However, coupling between the electron and nuclear spins introduces a phase kickback during optical excitation that limits the utility of the nuclear memory. Here, we propose using the large hyperfine coupling of SnV-117 to operate the device at zero magnetic field in a regime where the memory is insensitive to optical excitation. We further demonstrate ground state spin control of a SnV-117 color center integrated in a photonic integrated circuit, showing 97.8% gate fidelity and 2.5 ms coherence time for the memory spin level. This shows the viability of the zero-field protocol for high fidelity operation, and lays the groundwork for building quantum network nodes with SnV-117 devices.

Title: Dephasing in Rydberg Facilitation Due to State-Dependent Dipole Forces
Authors: Tom Schlegel, Evangelia Konstantinidou, Michael Fleischhauer, Daniel Brady
Abstract: Rydberg atoms allow for the experimental study of open many-body systems and nonequilibrium phenomena. High dephasing rates are a generic feature of these systems, and therefore they can often be described by rate equations, i.e. in the classical limit. In this work, we analyze one potential origin of the decoherence in Rydberg atoms: dipole-force induced dephasing. As the wave function of the Rydberg (spin-up) state is repelled in the presence of another nearby Rydberg atom, while the ground (spin-down) state diffuses in place, the Franck-Condon overlap between the two spin components quickly decays causing a decoherence of the spin transition. With an analytic approach we obtain a simple expression for the dephasing rate of the Rydberg state depending on atomic and laser parameters, which agrees with numerical findings.

Title: Spins extracted from fermionic states and their entanglement properties
Authors: Filippo Troiani, Andrea Secchi, Stefano Pittalis
Abstract: We investigate the spin states obtained by extracting $n$ electrons from closed-shell fermionic states. A partition of the system is defined through the introduction of the extraction modes. We derive the expression of the $n$-body reduced density matrices, which represent the extracted spin states. We show that these states exhibit different forms of spin entanglement, whose detection is discussed in terms of the spin squeezing inequalities.

Title: Unraveling spin entanglement using quantum gates with scanning tunneling microscopy-driven electron spin resonance
Authors: Eric D. Switzer, Jose Reina-Gálvez, Géza Giedke, Talat S. Rahman, Christoph Wolf, Deung-Jang Choi, Nicolás Lorente
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource for quantum information processing, and its controlled generation and detection remain key challenges in scalable quantum architectures. Here, we numerically demonstrate the deterministic generation of entangled spin states in a solid-state platform by implementing quantum gates via electron spin resonance combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (ESR-STM). Using two titanium atoms on a MgO/Ag(100) substrate as a model, we construct a two-qubit system whose dynamics are coherently manipulated through tailored microwave pulse sequences. We generate Bell states by implementing a Hadamard gate followed by a controlled-NOT gate, and evaluate its fidelity and concurrence using the quantum-master equation-based code TimeESR. Our results demonstrate that ESR-STM can create entangled states with significant fidelity. This study paves the way for the realization of atom-based quantum circuits and highlights ESR-STM as a powerful tool for probing and engineering entangled states on surfaces.

Title: Production-ready double-side fabrication of dual-band infrared meta-optics using deep-UV lithography
Authors: Kai Sun, Xingzhao Yan, Jordan Scott, Jun-Yu Ou, James N. Monks, Otto L. Muskens
Abstract: Meta-optics, the application of metasurfaces into optical systems, is seeing an accelerating development owing to advantages in size, weight and cost and the ability to program optical functions beyond traditional refractive optics. The transition of meta-optics from the laboratory into applications is enabled by scalable production methods based on highly reproducible semiconductor process technology. Here, we introduce a novel method for fabrication of double-sided metasurfaces through deep-UV lithography as a production-ready method for achieving high-quality meta-optics. We achieve patterning of a silicon wafer on both sides with mutual alignment of around 25 $\mu$m based on tool accuracy, without requiring through-wafer alignment markers other than the wafer notch. A first novel application highlighting the benefits of double-sided design is demonstrated in the form of a dual-band metalens with independent control over focal lengths in mid- and long-wave infrared bands. Using multi-reticle stitching we demonstrate a 40 mm diameter, large-area metalens with excellent broadband imaging performance, showing partial cancelling of chromatic dispersion when used in a hybrid configuration with a BaF$_2$ refractive lens. Our work opens new avenues for infrared meta-optics designs and double-side meta-optics fabrication through a production-ready technique which can be directly translated into scalable technology for real-world applications.

Title: Ultraviolet interband plasmonics down to the vacuum UV with ultrathin amorphous silicon nanostructures
Authors: Johann Toudert, Rosalía Serna, Javier Martín Sánchez, Juan I. Larruquert, Lorenzo Calvo-Barrío
Abstract: Silicon dominates electronics, optoelectronics, photovoltaics and photonics thanks to its suitable properties, abundance, and well-developed cost-effective manufacturing processes. Recently, crystalline silicon has been demonstrated to be an appealing alternative plasmonic material, both for the infrared where free-carrier plasmons are enabled by heavy doping, and for the ultraviolet where plasmonic effects are induced by interband transitions. Herein, we demonstrate that nanostructured amorphous silicon exhibits such so-called interband plasmonic properties in the ultraviolet, as opposed to the expectation that they would only arise in crystalline materials. We report optical plasmon resonances in the 100-to-300 nm wavelength range in ultrathin nanostructures. These resonances shift spectrally with the nanostructure shape and the nature of the surrounding matrix, while their field enhancement properties turn from surface plasmonic to epsilon-near-zero plasmonic. We present a vacuum ultraviolet wavelength- and polarization-selective ultrathin film absorber design based on deeply-subwavelength anisotropically-shaped nanostructures. These findings reveal amorphous silicon as a promising material platform for ultracompact and room-temperature-processed ultraviolet plasmonic devices operating down to vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths, for applications including anticounterfeiting, data encryption and storage, sensing and detection. Furthermore, these findings raise a fundamental question on how plasmonics can be based on amorphous nanostructures.

Title: Resonant cavity-QED with chiral flat bands
Authors: E. M. Broni, A. M. C. Souza, M. L. Lyra, F. A. B. F. de Moura, G. M. A. Almeida
Abstract: Flat bands exhibit high degeneracy and intrinsic localization, offering a promising platform for enhanced light-matter interactions. Here, we investigate the resonant interaction between a two-level emitter and a chiral flat band hosted by a photonic lattice. In the weak coupling regime, the emitter undergoes Rabi oscillations with a lifted photonic mode whose spatial structure reflects the nature of compact localized states and the onset of Anderson localization. We illustrate our approach using selected chiral quasi-1D lattices. Our findings provide a route to flat band state preparation via quench dynamics while preserving the structure of the flat band.

Title: Intermittent fluctuations determine the nature of chaos in turbulence
Authors: Aikya Banerjee, Ritwik Mukherjee, Sugan Durai Murugan, Subhro Bhattacharjee, Samriddhi Sankar Ray
Abstract: We adapt recent ideas for many-body chaos in nonlinear, Hamiltonian fluids [Murugan \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 124501 (2021)] to revisit the question of the Reynolds number Re dependence of the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda\propto{\rm Re}^\alpha$ in fully developed turbulence. The use of such decorrelators allow us to investigate the interplay of the competing effects of viscous dissipation and nonlinearity. We obtain a precise value of $\alpha = 0.59 \pm 0.04$ and show that departure from the Kolmogorov mean field result $\lambda \propto \sqrt{\rm Re}$ is a consequence of the intermittent fluctuations in the velocity-gradient tensor. The robustness of our results are further confirmed in a local, dynamical systems model for turbulence.

Title: Experimental study of the distributions of off-diagonal scattering-matrix elements of quantum graphs with symplectic symmetry
Authors: Jiongning Che, Nils Gluth, Simon Köhnes, Thomas Guhr, Barbara Dietz
Abstract: We report on experimental studies of the distribution of the off-diagonal elements of the scattering matrix of open microwave networks with symplectic symmetry and a chaotic wave dynamics. These consist of two geometrically identical subgraphs with unitary symmetry described by complex conjugate Hamiltonians, that are coupled by a pair of bonds. The results are compared to random-matrix theory predictions obtained on the basis of the Heidelberg approach for the scattering matrix of open quantum-chaotic systems. We demonstrate that deviations from random-matrix theory predictions observed in the distributions may be attributed to the fact that the subgraphs are not fully connected.

Title: Quantum simulation of bubble nucleation across a quantum phase transition
Authors: De Luo, Federica Maria Surace, Arinjoy De, Alessio Lerose, Elizabeth R. Bennewitz, Brayden Ware, Alexander Schuckert, Zohreh Davoudi, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Or Katz, Christopher Monroe
Abstract: The liquid-vapor transition is a classic example of a discontinuous (first-order) phase transition. Such transitions underlie many phenomena in cosmology, nuclear and particle physics, and condensed-matter physics. They give rise to long-lived metastable states, whose decay can be driven by either thermal or quantum fluctuations. Yet, direct experimental observations of how these states collapse into a stable phase remain elusive in the quantum regime. Here, we use a trapped-ion quantum simulator to observe the real-time dynamics of ``bubble nucleation'' induced by quantum fluctuations. Bubbles are localized domains of the stable phase which spontaneously form, or nucleate, and expand as the system is driven across a discontinuous quantum phase transition. Implementing a mixed-field Ising spin model with tunable and time-dependent interactions, we track the microscopic evolution of the metastable state as the Hamiltonian parameters are varied in time with various speeds, bringing the system out of equilibrium. Site-resolved measurements reveal the emergence and evolution of finite-size quantum bubbles, providing direct insight into the mechanism by which the metastable phase decays. We also identify nonequilibrium scaling behavior near the transition, consistent with a generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our results demonstrate the power of quantum simulators to probe out-of-equilibrium many-body physics, including quantum bubble nucleation, a key feature of discontinuous quantum phase transitions, with application to studies of matter formation in the early universe.

Title: Emergent SU(2)$_1$ conformal symmetry in the spin-1/2 Kitaev-Gamma chain with a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
Authors: Wang Yang, Alberto Nocera, Chao Xu, Arnab Adhikary, Ian Affleck
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional spin-1/2 Kitaev-Gamma model with a bond-dependent Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, which can be induced by an electric field applied in the third direction where the first and second directions refer to the two bond directions in the model. By a combination of field theory and symmetry analysis, an extended gapless phase with an emergent SU(2)$_1$ conformal symmetry is found in the phase diagram of the spin-1/2 Kitaev-Gamma-DM chain. The analytic predictions are in good agreements with numerical results obtained from density matrix renormalization group simulations.

Title: Topological phase locking in stochastic oscillators
Authors: Michalis Chatzittofi, Ramin Golestanian, Jaime Agudo-Canalejo
Abstract: The dynamics of many nanoscale biological and synthetic systems such as enzymes and molecular motors are activated by thermal noise, and driven out-of-equilibrium by local energy dissipation. Because the energies dissipated in these systems are comparable to the thermal energy, one would generally expect their dynamics to be highly stochastic. Here, by studying a thermodynamically-consistent model of two coupled noise-activated oscillators, we show that this is not always the case. Thanks to a novel phenomenon that we term topological phase locking (TPL), the coupled dynamics become quasi-deterministic, resulting in a greatly enhanced average speed of the oscillators. TPL is characterized by the emergence of a band of periodic orbits that form a torus knot in phase space, along which the two oscillators advance in rational multiples of each other. The effectively conservative dynamics along this band coexists with the basin of attraction of the dissipative fixed point. We further show that TPL arises as a result of a complex, infinite hierarchy of global bifurcations. Our results have implications for understanding the dynamics of a wide range of systems, from biological enzymes and molecular motors to engineered nanoscale electronic, optical, or mechanical oscillators.

Title: Localization with non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder
Authors: Aitijhya Saha, Debraj Rakshit
Abstract: In this work, we discuss a non-Hermitian system described via a one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, where the non-Hermiticity is governed by random nearest-neighbour tunnellings, such that the left-to-right and right-to-left hopping strengths are unequal. A physical situation of completely real eigenspectrum arises owing to the Hamiltonian's tridiagonal matrix structure under a simple sign conservation of the product of the conjugate nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms. The off-diagonal disorder leads the non-Hermitian system to a delocalization-localization crossover in finite systems. The emergent nature of the crossover is recognized through a finite-size spectral analysis. The system enters into a localized phase for infinitesimal disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit. We perform a careful scaling analysis of localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy splitting and report the corresponding scaling exponents. Noticeably, in contrast to the diagonal disorder, the density of states (DOS) has a singularity at E=0 in the presence of the off-diagonal disorder and the corresponding wavefunction remains delocalized for any given disorder strength.

Title: Thermodynamics of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore magnet Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_{7}$ in applied magnetic fields
Authors: Anish Bhardwaj, Victor Porée, Han Yan, Nicolas Gauthier, Elsa Lhotel, Sylvain Petit, Jeffrey A. Quilliam, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy, Romain Sibille, Hitesh J. Changlani
Abstract: The recently discovered dipole-octupole pyrochlore magnet Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ is a promising three-dimensional quantum spin liquid candidate which shows no signs of ordering at low temperature. The low energy effective pseudospin-1/2 description in a magnetic field is characterized by the XYZ Hamiltonian and a Zeeman term where the dipolar local $z$-component of the pseudospin couples to the local $z$-component of the applied magnetic field, while the local $x$- and $y$-components of the pseudospin remain decoupled as a consequence of their octupolar character. Using effective Hamiltonian parameters determined in V. Poree et al., arXiv:2305.08261 (2023), remarkable experimental features can be reproduced, as for instance the specific heat and magnetization data as well as the continuum of states seen in neutron scattering. Here we investigate the thermodynamic response to magnetic fields applied along the global [110] direction using specific heat measurements and fits using numerical methods, and solve the corresponding magnetic structure using neutron diffraction. Specific heat data in moderate fields are reproduced well, however, at high fields the agreement is not satisfactory. We especially observe a two-step release of entropy, a finding that demands a review of both theory and experiment. We address it within the framework of three possible scenarios, including an analysis of the crystal field Hamiltonian not restricted to the two-dimensional single-ion doublet subspace. We conclusively rule out two of these scenarios and find qualitative agreement with a simple model of field misalignment with respect to the crystalline direction. We discuss the implications of our findings for [111] applied fields and for future experiments on Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ and its sister compounds.

Title: Quantum size effects on Andreev transport in Nb/Au/Nb Josephson junctions: A combined ab-initio and experimental study
Authors: Hiroki Yamazaki, Gabor Csire, Nora Kucska, Nic Shannon, Balazs Gyorffy, Hidenori Takagi, Balazs Ujfalussy
Abstract: We have measured the critical current density, superconducting coherence length, and superconducting transition temperature of single-domain, epitaxially-grown Nb(110)/Au(111)/Nb(110) trilayers, all of which show a non-monotonic dependence on the thickness of the Au layer. These results are compared with the predictions of a relativistic, ab-initio theory, which incorporates superconducting correlations. We find good agreement with experiment, coming from a rich interplay between superconducting proximity - and quantum size effects, mediated by Andreev bound states. These results suggest that quantum size effects could provide a systematic method of controlling the transport properties of superconducting multilayers.

Title: Ineffectiveness of Formamidine in Suppressing Ultralow Thermal Conductivity in Cubic Hybrid Perovskite FAPbI3
Authors: Jiongzhi Zheng, Zheng Chang, Changpeng Lin, Chongjia Lin, Yanguang Zhou, Baoling Huang, Ruiqiang Guo, Geoffroy Hautier
Abstract: Fundamentally understanding the lattice dynamics and microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites remains elusive, primarily due to their strong anharmonicity and frequent phase transitions. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the thermal transport behavior in cubic hybrid perovskite FAPbI3, integrating first principles-based anharmonic lattice dynamics with a linearized Wigner transport formula. The Temperature Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP) technique allows us to stabilize the negative soft modes, primarily dominated by organic cations, at finite temperatures in cubic FAPbI3. We then predict an ultra-low thermal conductivity of ~0.63 Wm^(-1) K^(-1) in cubic FAPbI3 at 300 K, with a temperature dependence of T^(-0.740), suggesting a good crystalline nature of phonon transport. Notably, the ultra-low thermal conductivity in cubic FAPbI3 is primarily attributed to the [PbI3]1- units, challenging the conventional focus on organic FA+ cations. This shift in focus is due to the presence of Pb(s)-I(p) anti-bonding sates within the [PbI3]1- units. Furthermore, thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 is predominantly governed by the particle-like phonon propagation channel across the entire temperature range of 300-500 K, a result of diminished suppression of low-frequency phonons by FA+ cations and large inter-branch spacings. Finally, our findings underscore that the anharmonic force constants are highly temperature-sensitive, leading to underestimations of thermal conductivity when relying on 0-K anharmonic force constants. Our study not only elucidates the microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 but also provides a crucial framework for the discovery, design, and understanding of hybrid organic-inorganic compounds with ultra-low thermal conductivity.

Title: Quantum Hall edges beyond the plasma analogy
Authors: Per Moosavi, Blagoje Oblak, Bastien Lapierre, Benoit Estienne, Jean-Marie Stéphan
Abstract: We demonstrate that the widely used plasma analogy is unreliable at predicting edge properties of quantum Hall states. This discrepancy arises from a fundamental difference between quantum Hall droplets and plasmas (Coulomb gases): the former are incompressible liquids subject to area-preserving deformations, while the latter are governed by electrostatics and thus involve conformal transformations. Consequently, the plasma analogy fails at the edge, except in fine-tuned geometries, as it does not account for the emergent local edge velocity. We quantitatively show how the analogy's failure affects physical quantities, such as fluctuations of local observables and absorption rates in microwave spectroscopy, measurable in both solid-state experiments and quantum simulators.

Title: Experimental realization of an analog of entanglement between two Brownian particles
Authors: Lakshmanan Theerthagiri, Sergio Ciliberto
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the statistical properties of a classical analog of quantum entanglement considering two Brownian particles connected by an elastic force and maintained at different temperatures through separate heat reservoirs. Uncertainty relations between coordinates and coarse-grained velocity can produce a phenomenon similar to quantum entanglement, where temperature plays the role of Planck's constant. The theoretical analysis matches the experimental results, confirming that the interconnected particles exhibit Brownian quantum-inspired classical correlation entanglement. This effect arises from a coarse-grained description of Brownian motion and vanishes at a finer resolution. The coarsening scales range is measured too.

Title: Parafermionic representation of Potts-based cluster chain
Authors: Tigran Hakobyan, Raffi Varosyan
Abstract: The cluster chain with $\mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order is decomposed into two distinct bilinear parafermionic chains, each possessing intrinsic topological order. These chains are formed by standard parafermions and time-reversal parafermions, respectively. Each subsystem retains its own $\mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetry component, which characterizes the total parity of constituent particles. Their topological orders are inherited from the two SPT orders of the cluster model. The transformations of particles under reflection, translation, and time reversal are derived. In the open chain, four zero-energy parafermionic edge modes are identified, and their structure is analyzed. For the closed system, the boundaries are twisted by the total parafermion parity. It is shown that the open chain is reflection-invariant when the number of spins is even, and $\mathcal{PT}$-invariant when the number of spins is odd. Meanwhile, the closed model exhibits a symmetry characterized by an antiunitary analog of the dihedral group.

Title: Mechanistic rules for de novo design of enzymes
Authors: Michalis Chatzittofi, Jaime Agudo-Canalejo, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: Enzymes are nano-scale machines that have evolved to drive chemical reactions out of equilibrium in the right place at the right time. Given the complexity and specificity of enzymatic function, bottom-up design of enzymes presents a daunting task that is far more challenging than making passive molecules with specific binding affinities or building nano-scale mechanically active devices. We present a thermodynamically-consistent model for the operation of such a fuelled enzyme, which uses the energy from a favourable reaction to undergo non-equilibrium conformational changes that in turn catalyze a chemical reaction on an attached substrate molecule. We show that enzymatic function can emerge through a bifurcation upon appropriate implementation of momentum conservation on the effective reaction coordinates of the low dimensional description of the enzyme, and thanks to a generically present dissipative coupling. Our results can complement the recently developed strategies for de novo enzyme design based on machine learning approaches.

Title: Sensitivity of Multislice Electron Ptychography to Point Defects: A Case Study in SiC
Authors: Aaditya Bhat, Colin Gilgenbach, Junghwa Kim, Michael Xu, Menglin Zhu, James M. LeBeau
Abstract: Here, we evaluate multislice electron ptychography as a tool to carry out depth-resolved atomic resolution characterization of point defects, using silicon carbide as a case study. Through multislice electron scattering simulations and multislice ptychographic reconstructions, we investigate the phase contrast arising from individual silicon vacancies, antisite defects, and a wide range of substitutional transition metal dopants (V\textsubscript{Si} to W\textsubscript{Si}) and potential detectability. Simulating defect types, positions, and microscope conditions, we show that isolated point defects can be located within a unit cell along the sample's depth. The influence of electron energy, dose, defocus, and convergence semi-angle is also explored to determine their role in governing defect contrast. These results guide experiments aiming to analyze point defects with multislice electron ptychography.

Title: Fluctuation Dissipation Relations for Active Field Theories
Authors: Martin Kjøllesdal Johnsrud, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: Breakdown of time-reversal symmetry is a defining property of non-equilibrium systems, such as active matter, which is composed of units that consume energy. We employ a formalism that allows us to derive a class of identities associated with the time-reversal transformation in non-equilibrium field theories, in the spirit of Ward-Takahashi identities. We present a generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem valid for active systems as a particular realization of such an identity, and consider its implications and applications for a range of active field theories. The field theoretical toolbox developed here helps to quantify the degree of non-equilibrium activity of complex systems exhibiting collective behavior.

Title: High-efficiency quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for extracting entanglement entropy in interacting fermion systems
Authors: Weilun Jiang, Gaopei Pan, Zhe Wang, Bin-Bin Mao, Heng Shen, Zheng Yan
Abstract: The entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo has made great achievements in large-scale interacting spin/boson systems. In contrast, the numerical exploration in interacting fermion systems is rare, even though fermion systems attract more attentions in condensed matter. The fundamental restrictions is that the computational cost of fermion quantum Monte Carlo ($\sim \beta N^3$) is much higher than that of spin/boson ($\sim \beta N$). Here, $N$ is the total number of sites and $\beta$ is the inverse temperature or projection length. To tackle this problem, we propose a fermionic quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the incremental technique along physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency of extracting entanglement entropy. We benchmark the developed algorithm by calculating the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model. The obtained phase diagram including Fermi surface and Goldstone modes validates the correctness of the algorithm. Remarkably, our method shows the high-efficiency with respect to the existing algorithms, while keeping the high computation precision. We proceed to apply this algorithm to explore the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy and particularly its derivative at Gross-Neveu criticality. Our results elucidate that such critical behavior can be quantified by the correlation length exponent.

Title: Praseodymium doping effect on the superconducting properties of FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ bulks under ambient and high-pressure growth conditions
Authors: Priya Singh, Manasa Manasa, Mohammad Azam, Tatiana Zajarniuk, Svitlana Stelmakh, Taras Palasyuk, Jan Mizeracki, Tomasz Cetner, Andrzej Morawski, Cezariusz Jastrzębski, Michał Wierzbicki, Shiv J. Singh
Abstract: A series of Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 (Fe1-xPrxSe0.5Te0.5; x = 0 to 0.3) bulks are prepared by conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), and high gas pressure and high temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) methods. These bulks are well characterized by structural and microstructural analysis, Raman spectroscopy, transport, and magnetic measurements. The HP-HTS process of the parent bulks has enhanced the onset transition temperature (Tconset) by 1.5 K and the critical current density (Jc) by two orders of magnitude compared to the CSP method. Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 up to 10% doping content prepared, either CSP or HP-HTS, slightly increases the unit cell volume, and high-pressure growth produces an almost pure superconducting phase, which confirms the successful Pr-doping at Fe sites. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations suggest the substitution of Pr-atoms in the interlayer spacing of Fe(Se,Te) lattice. High-pressure growth of Fe1-xPrxSe0.5Te0.5 also makes the sample less dense compared to the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Transport and magnetic measurements depict that Tconset is almost unaffected by Pr-doping, whereas Jc of Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 is enhanced by one order of magnitude relative to the parent sample developed by CSP but lower than that of the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Hence, Pr- doping at Fe sites preserves Tconset and improves Jc of FeSe0.5Te0.5 regardless of the doping contents and growth conditions. These results are promising for the practical application of iron-based superconductors to improve Jc properties without affecting Tconset through CSP process and congruent with discoveries from other superconductors, like cuprates and MgB2.

Title: Permutation Entropy for the Characterization of the Attractive Hamiltonian Mean-Field Model
Authors: Melissa Fuentealba, Danilo M. Rivera, Roberto E. Navarro
Abstract: The Hamiltonian Mean-Field (HMF) model is a long-range interaction model that exhibits quasi-stationary states associated with a phase transition. Its quasi-stationary states with a lifetime diverging with the number of particles in the system. These states are characterized by homogeneous or non-homogeneous structures in phase-space. There exists a phase-transition between these states that have been traditionally characterized by the their mean magnetization. However, the magnetization also exhibits fluctuations in time around its mean value, that can be an indicator of the kind of quasi-stationary state. Thus, we want to characterize the quasi-stationary states of the HMF model through the time-series of the magnetization and its fluctuations through a measure of information, i.e. the permutation entropy and the complexity-entropy plane. Permutation entropy is a measure for characterizing chaotic time series, especially in the presence of dynamic and observational noise, as it is computationally and conceptually simple. For non-homogeneous states, the permutation entropy shows that the HMF model tends towards order, while the magnetizacion fluctuations reveal reduced structures in time. On the contrary, homogeneous states tend to disorder and the structures of the magnetization fluctuations increase as the initial magnetization is larger. In all the study cases of this thesis, the HMF model is characterized by low entropy values but the highest possible complexity value. Thus, the HMF model can be described as a chaotic, deterministic and intermitent system. This aligns with previous studies of the model in the phase space. The results demonstrate that the HMF model can be understood and interpreted from the fluctuations of magnetization using permutation entropy and the complexity-entropy plane.

Title: Exploration of stable atomic configurations in graphene-like BCN systems by Bayesian optimization
Authors: Taichi Hara, Akira Kusaba, Yoshihiro Kangawa, Tetsuji Kuboyama, David Bowler, Karol Kawka, Pawel Kempisty
Abstract: The h-BCN is an intriguing material system where the bandgap varies considerably depending on the atomic configuration, even at a fixed composition. Exploring stable atomic configurations in this system is crucial for discussing the energetic formability and controllability of desirable configurations. In this study, this challenge is tackled by combining first-principles calculations with Bayesian optimization. An encoding method that represents the configurations as vectors, while incorporating information about the local atomic environments, is proposed for the search. Although the optimization did not function with the conventional one-hot encoding that had been effective in other material systems, the proposed encoding proved efficient in the search. As a result, two interesting semiconductor configurations were discovered. These configurations exhibit qualitatively similar patterns to conventional models, and one of the two is more stable than the conventional ones with the same periodicity. Furthermore, the optimization behavior is discussed through principal component analysis, confirming that the ordered BN network and the C configuration features are well embedded in the search space. The proposed encoding method, which is easy to implement, is expected to expand the applicability of atomic configuration search using Bayesian optimization to a broader range of material systems.

Title: Switchable Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Bogoliubov Modes
Authors: Hsuan Lo, You Wang, Rimi Banerjee, Baile Zhang, Y. D. Chong
Abstract: Interacting or nonlinear lattices can host emergent particle-like modes, such as Bogoliubov quasiparticles, whose band topology and other properties are potentially highly tunable. Despite originating in the study of superconducting materials, Bogoliubov quasiparticles can also occur in synthetic metamaterials. Here, we implement a nonlinear driven-dissipative circuit whose fluctuations are Bogoliubov modes possessing nontrivial non-Hermitian band topology. We show experimentally that the system exhibits a switchable non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which abruptly appears when the on-site driving voltage amplitude exceeds a threshold. In contrast to earlier realizations of the NHSE and related phenomena in circuit models, the switchable NHSE in our system occurs in Bogoliubov modes, which are strongly affected by how the system is driven. Moreover, unlike other experimental platforms hosting non-Hermitian Bogoliubov modes, our system does not contain unconventional asymmetric hopping nonlinearities, only a local Kerr-type nonlinearity.

Title: Copper delocalization leads to ultralow thermal conductivity in chalcohalide CuBiSeCl2
Authors: Yuzhou Hao, Junwei Che, Xiaoying Wang, Xuejie Li, Turab Lookman, Jun Sun, Xiangdong Ding, Zhibin Gao
Abstract: Mixed anion halide-chalcogenide materials have attracted considerable attention due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, making them promising candidates for various applications. Among these, CuBiSeCl_2 has recently been experimentally identified with remarkably low lattice thermal conductivity (k_L). In this study, we employ Wigner transport theory combined with neuroevolution machine learning potential (NEP)-assisted self-consistent phonon calculations to unravel the microscopic origins of this low k_L. Our findings reveal that the delocalization and weak bonding of copper atoms are key contributors to the strong phonon anharmonicity and wavelike tunneling (random walk diffusons). These insights deepen our understanding of the relationship between bonding characteristics, anharmonicity, delocalization, and vibrational dynamics, paving the way for the design and optimization of CuBiSeCl_2 and analogous materials for advanced phonon engineering applications.

Title: Stoichiometry and Thickness of Epitaxial SrTiO$_{3}$ on Silicon (001): an Investigation of Physical, Optical and Electrical Properties
Authors: Andries Boelen, Marina Baryshnikova, Anja Ulrich, Kamal Brahim, Joris Van de Vondel, Christian Haffner, Clement Merckling
Abstract: Strontium titanate (SrTiO$_{3}$, STO) stands out as a promising material for various electronic applications thanks to its exceptional dielectric properties. Molecular beam epitaxy is one of the few techniques which allows epitaxial growth of STO directly on industry-relevant silicon substrates. However, maintaining precise stoichiometry and high crystalline quality in this process remains a significant challenge. Establishing this is essential to obtain STO with bulk-like dielectric properties and to minimize leakage current and optical absorbance. In this study, the importance of cationic stoichiometry and the effect of thickness are investigated for STO thin films epitaxially grown on silicon. We employed real-time reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) as a feedback loop mechanism to counteract Sr source oxidation and maintain a constant flux. Additionally, high-temperature post-growth annealing treatments in O$_{2}$ were investigated to promote layer relaxation and reduce oxygen vacancy concentration, thereby improving the physical, electrical, and optical properties of stoichiometric STO. As a result, high-quality STO thin films exceeding 100 nm were successfully fabricated featuring a bulk-like out-of-plane lattice parameter and refractive index, as well as rocking curve full width at half maximum below 0.2°, smooth surface (R$_{q}$ < 0.2 nm) and a leakage current density below 1E-7 A/cm$^{2}$.

Title: Bending-strain effects in conventional superconductors and superconducting junctions
Authors: Kjell S. Heinrich, Henning G. Hugdal, Morten Amundsen, Sol H. Jacobsen
Abstract: We consider the effect of bending-strain in thin films of clean, conventional superconductors (S), and the proximity-induced effect of this strain in SN bilayers with a normal metal (N), and SNS junctions with equal curvatures in each superconductor. We find that the effective spin-orbit coupling due to strain in the superconductor induces both spin-polarized and unequal-spin even-frequency p-wave triplet pairings throughout the superconductor. When interfaced with a normal metal, additional odd-frequency pairings are induced, and their magnitudes can be tuned with the strain. In SNS junctions, the strain alone can induce a superconducting spin current in the junction. The spin-polarized current can undergo a $0-\pi$-transition, resulting in an in-plane, strain-induced magnetization that switches sign as a function of the strain. We discuss the underlying physics and its implications for superconducting spintronics.

Title: Multifractal-enriched mobility edges and emergent quantum phases in Rydberg atomic arrays
Authors: Shan-Zhong Li, Yi-Cai Zhang, Yucheng Wang, Shanchao Zhang, Shi-Liang Zhu, Zhi Li
Abstract: Anderson localization describes disorder-induced phase transitions, distinguishing between localized and extended states. In quasiperiodic systems, a third multifractal state emerges, characterized by unique energy and wave functions. However, the corresponding multifractal-enriched mobility edges and three-state-coexisting quantum phases have yet to be experimentally detected. In this work, we propose exactly-solvable one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models that simultaneously host three-state-coexisting quantum phases, with their phase boundaries analytically derived via Avila's global theorem. Furthermore, we propose experimental protocols via Rydberg atom arrays to realize these states. Notably, we demonstrate a spectroscopic technique capable of measuring inverse participation ratios across real-space and dual-space domains, enabling simultaneous characterization of localized, extended, and multifractal quantum phases in systems with up to tens of qubits. Our work opens new avenues for the experimental exploration of Anderson localization and multifractal states in artificial quantum systems.

Title: Stacking disorder in novel ABAC-stacked brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$
Authors: Aswathi Mannathanath Chakkingal, Chloe Fuller, Maxim Avdeev, Roman Gumeniuk, Kaushick K. Parui, Marein C. Rahn, Falk Pabst, Yiran Wang, Sergey Granovsky, Artem Korshunov, Dmitry Chernyshov, Dmytro S. Inosov, Darren C. Peets
Abstract: In geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, weak interactions or slight changes to the structure can tip the delicate balance of exchange interactions, sending the system into a different ground state. Brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$, has a copper sublattice composed of distorted triangles, making it a likely host for frustrated magnetism, but exhibits stacking disorder. The lack of synthetic single crystals has limited research on the magnetism in brochantite to powders and natural mineral crystals. We grew crystals which we find to be a new polytype with a tendency toward ABAC stacking and some anion disorder, alongside the expected stacking disorder. Comparison to previous results on natural mineral specimens suggests that cation disorder is more deleterious to the magnetism than anion and stacking disorder. Our specific heat data suggest a double transition on cooling into the magnetically ordered state.

Title: Platforms for the realization and characterization of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids
Authors: Isabelle Bouchoule, Roberta Citro, Tim Duty, Thierry Giamarchi, Randall G. Hulet, Martin Klanjsek, Edmond Orignac, Bent Weber
Abstract: The concept of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) has been established as a fundamental theory for the understanding of one-dimensional quantum systems. Originally formulated as a replacement for Landau's Fermi-liquid theory, which accurately predicts the behaviour of most 3D metals but fails dramatically in 1D, the TLL description applies to a even broader class of 1D systems,including bosons and anyons. After a certain number of theoretical breakthroughs, its descriptive power has now been confirmed experimentally in different experimental platforms. They extend from organic conductors, carbon nanotubes, quantum wires, topological edge states of quantum spin Hall insulators to cold atoms, Josephson junctions, Bose liquids confined within 1D nanocapillaries and spin chains. In the ground state of such systems, quantum fluctuations become correlated on all length scales, but, counter-intuitively, no long-range order exists. In this respect, this review will illustrate the validity of conformal field theory for describing real-world systems, establishing the boundaries for its application and, on the other side will discuss the spectacular demonstration of how the quantum-critical TLL state governs the properties of many-body systems in one dimension.

Title: High-temperature superconductivity in Li$_2$AuH$_6$ mediated by strong electron-phonon coupling under ambient pressure
Authors: Zhenfeng Ouyang, Bo-Wen Yao, Xiao-Qi Han, Peng-Jie Guo, Ze-Feng Gao, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: We used our developed AI search engine~(InvDesFlow) to perform extensive investigations regarding ambient stable superconducting hydrides. A cubic structure Li$_2$AuH$_6$ with Au-H octahedral motifs is identified to be a candidate. After performing thermodynamical analysis, we provide a feasible route to experimentally synthesize this material via the known LiAu and LiH compounds under ambient pressure. The further first-principles calculations suggest that Li$_2$AuH$_6$ shows a high superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) $\sim$ 140 K under ambient pressure. The H-1$s$ electrons strongly couple with phonon modes of vibrations of Au-H octahedrons as well as vibrations of Li atoms, where the latter is not taken seriously in other previously similar cases. Hence, different from previous claims of searching metallic covalent bonds to find high-$T_c$ superconductors, we emphasize here the importance of those phonon modes with strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC). And we suggest that one can intercalate atoms into binary or ternary hydrides to introduce more potential phonon modes with strong EPC, which is an effective approach to find high-$T_c$ superconductors within multicomponent compounds.

Title: Topology Optimization of Pneumatic Soft Actuators Based on Porohyperelasticity
Authors: Sumit Mehta, Konstantinos Poulios
Abstract: This paper introduces a new nonlinear topology optimization framework which employs porohyperelasticity for providing computational design of pneumatic soft actuators. Density-based topology optimization is used with the objective of maximizing the bending response in a soft actuator made of an elastomer, for given actuation pressure and external resistance. Pressurization of interconnected cavities is modeled via an extension of the Darcy flow theory that is valid for large deformations. Essential for the good performance of the framework is a carefully chosen interpolation scheme for the permeability between void and solid regions, as well as a suitable definition of a drainage term in the solid regions. Results are shown for a variety of actuation pressure and maximum allowable strain energy density levels, covering a wide range of system responses from small to rather large deformations.

Title: Non-Hermitian linear perturbation to a Hamiltonian with a constant electromagnetic field and Hall conductivity
Authors: Jorge A. Lizarraga, Kenan Uriostegui
Abstract: The stationary Schrödinger equation for an electron in a constant electromagnetic field with a non-Hermitian linear perturbation is studied. The wave function and the spectrum of the system are derived analytically, with the spectrum consisting of Landau levels modified by an additional term associated with the linear Stark effect, proportional to a complex constant $\lambda$. It is shown that this constant arises from an operator $\hat{\Pi}$ that commutes with the Hamiltonian, i.e., $\hat{\Pi}$ is a symmetry of the system. Finally, the Hall conductivity for the lowest Landau level is calculated, showing that it remains exactly equal to the inverse of Klitzing's constant despite the perturbation.

Title: Thermodynamic correlation inequalities for finite times and transients
Authors: Cai Dieball, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: Recently, a thermodynamic bound on correlation times was formulated in [A. Dechant, J. Garnier-Brun, S.-i. Sasa, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 167101 (2023)], showing how the decay of correlations in Langevin dynamics is bounded by short-time fluctuations and dissipation. Whereas these original results only address very long observation times in steady-state dynamics, we here generalize the respective inequalities to finite observations and general initial conditions. We utilize the connection between correlations and the fluctuations of time-integrated density functionals and generalize the direct stochastic calculus approach from [C. Dieball and A. Godec, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 087101 (2023)] which paves the way for further generalizations. We address the connection between short and long time scales, as well as the saturation of the bounds via complementary spectral-theoretic arguments. Motivated by the spectral insight, we formulate all results also for complex-valued observables.

Title: DC-driven separation of fractional flux quanta in two-band superconductors
Authors: Anton O. Pokusinkyi, Oleksandr V. Dobrovolskiy
Abstract: Two-band superconductors host vortices from superfluid condensates of different electron bands. These vortices carry a fractional flux quantum and attract each other, coalescing to form a composite vortex with the whole flux quantum $\phi_0$. However, due to the differences in viscosity and flux of the vortices across different bands, composite vortices may dissociate into fractional components. Here, we theoretically explore an approach to control the dissociation of composite vortices into fractional components and their separation into stationary and fast-moving ones through dc current and pinning strength variation. To this end, we numerically solve the dynamic equation of motion for a single dc-driven composite vortex in a periodic pinning potential. As the pinning strength increases, we observe a transition from depinning followed by dissociation in the weak-pinning regime to dissociation from the pinned state in the strong-pinning regime. Under moderately strong pinning, fractional vortices from one condensate may become immobile while those from the other may even move faster than the original composite vortex just before the dissociation. The predicted pinning- and dc-controlled separation of fractional flux quanta appeals for experimental investigation and potential application in fluxonic devices.

Title: KTaO3(001) Preparation Methods in Vacuum: Effects on Surface Stoichiometry, Crystallography, and in-gap States
Authors: Andrea M. Lucero Manzano, Esteban D. Cantero, Emanuel A. Martínez, F. Y. Bruno, Esteban A. Sánchez, Oscar Grizzi
Abstract: KTaO3 single crystals with different orientations are used as substrates for the epitaxial growth of thin films and/or as hosts for two-dimensional electron gases. Due to the polar nature of the KTaO3(001) surface, one can expect difficulties and challenges to arise in its preparation. Maintaining good insulating characteristics without adding undesirable in-gap electronic states, obtaining good crystalline order up to the top surface layer, a sufficiently flat surface, and complete cleanliness of the surface (without water, C or OH contaminants), are in general difficult conditions to accomplish simultaneously. Cleaving in vacuum is likely the best option for obtaining a clean surface. However, since KTaO3 is cubic and lacks a well-defined cleavage plane, this method is notsuitable for sample growth or reproducible device fabrication. Here, we systematically evaluate the effect of typical preparation methods applied on the surfaces of KTaO3(001) single crystals. In particular, we used annealing in vacuum at different temperatures, light sputtering with Ar+ ions at low energy (500 eV) followed by annealing, heavy Ar+ ion bombardment and annealing, and grazing Ar+ ion bombardment under continuous azimuthal rotation combined with both annealing in vacuum and in O2 atmosphere. Possible side effects after each treatment are evaluated by a combination of techniques, including low-energy ion scattering at forward angles, Auger electron spectroscopy, low-energy electron energy loss, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and time of flightsecondary ion mass spectrometry. Advantages and shortcomings of each preparation method are discussed in detail.

Title: Finite temperature phase diagram of the extended Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of disorder
Authors: Madhumita Kabiraj, Raka Dasgupta
Abstract: We study the finite and non-zero temperature phase diagram of the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model for both pure and disordered systems. Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid (NF). In contrast, the insulating phases that survive at high temperatures in the presence of disorder are the Bose glass and the normal fluid. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.

Title: Coarse-grained graph architectures for all-atom force predictions
Authors: Sungwoo Kang
Abstract: We introduce a machine-learning framework termed coarse-grained all-atom force field (CGAA-FF), which incorporates coarse-grained message passing within an all-atom force field using equivariant nature of graph models. The CGAA-FF model employs grain embedding to encode atomistic coordinates into nodes representing grains rather than individual atoms, enabling predictions of both grain-level energies and atom-level forces. Tested on organic electrolytes, CGAA-FF achieves root-mean-square errors of 4.96 meV atom-1 for energy and 0.201 eV A-1 for force predictions. CGAA-FF significantly reduces computational costs, achieving about 22- and 14-fold improvements in simulation speed and memory efficiency, respectively, compared to the all-atom potential (SevenNet-0). Since this CGAA framework can be integrated into any equivariant architecture, we believe this work opens the door to efficient all-atom simulations of soft-matter systems.

Title: Symmetry constrained field theories for chiral spin liquid to spin crystal transitions
Authors: Anjishnu Bose, Andrew Hardy, Naren Manjunath, Arun Paramekanti
Abstract: We consider the spin rotationally invariant Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (CSL) in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry and explore symmetry constraints on possible conventional spin crystal states accessible via a direct transition. These constraints provide a framework to identify topological invariants of the magnetically ordered state. We show that the existence of a direct transition from a CSL requires a precise compatibility condition between the topological invariants of the ordered state and the anomaly of the CSL. The lattice symmetries also constrain the functional form of the low-energy theory to describe these transitions. This allows us to construct explicit Chern-Simons-matter field theories for the transition into a class of noncoplanar orders identified as candidates directly accessible from the CSL, including the octahedral spin crystal on the kagomé lattice, and the tetrahedral order on the triangular and honeycomb lattice. These transitions can either be described using coupled fractionalized $ \mathbb{CP}^1 $ theories or fractionalized matrix principal chiral models. We also discuss extensions to more general magnetic ordering transitions out of the CSL.

Title: Accelerated escape dynamics in non-Markovian stochastic feedback
Authors: Francesco Coghi, Romain Duvezin, John S. Wettlaufer
Abstract: We study the escape dynamics of a non-Markovian stochastic process with time-averaged feedback, which we model as a one-dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process wherein the drift is modified by the empirical mean of its trajectory. This process maps onto a class of self-interacting diffusions. Using weak-noise large deviation theory, we derive the most probable escape paths and quantify their likelihood via the action functional. We compute the feedback-modified Kramers rate and its inverse, which approximates the mean escape time, and show that the feedback accelerates escape by storing finite-time fluctuations thereby lowering the effective energy barrier, and shifting the optimal escape time from infinite to finite. Although we identify alternative mechanisms, such as slingshot and ballistic escape trajectories, we find that they remain sub-optimal and hence do not accelerate escape. These results show how memory feedback reshapes rare event statistics, thereby offering a mechanism to potentially control escape dynamics.

Title: Finite Membrane Thickness Influences Hydrodynamics on the Nanoscale
Authors: Zachary G. Lipel, Yannick A. D. Omar, Dimitrios Fraggedakis
Abstract: Many lipid membrane-mediated transport processes--such as mechanically-gated channel activation and solute transport--involve structural and dynamical features on membrane thickness length scales. Most existing membrane models, however, tend to adopt (quasi-)two-dimensional descriptions that neglect thickness-dependent phenomena relevant to internal membrane mechanics, and thus do not fully account for the complex coupling of lipid membranes with their surrounding fluid media. Therefore, explicitly incorporating membrane thickness effects in lipid membrane models will enable a more accurate description of the influence of membrane/fluid coupling on transport phenomena in the vicinity of the bilayer surfaces. Here, we present a continuum model for membrane fluctuations that accounts for finite membrane thickness and resolves hydrodynamic interactions between the bilayer and its surrounding fluid. By applying linear response analysis, we observe that membrane thickness-mediated effects, such as bending-induced lipid reorientations, can generate shear flows close to the membrane surface that slow down the relaxation of nanometer scale shape fluctuations. Additionally, we reveal the emergence of pressure inversion and flow reversal near the membrane interfaces, accompanied by localized stagnation points. Among these, extensional stagnation points give rise to a novel mode of bulk dissipation, originating from bending-induced compression and expansion of the membrane surfaces and their coupling to shear stresses in the fluid. Our findings identify membrane thickness as a key factor in nanoscale hydrodynamics and suggest that its effects may be detectable in fluctuation spectra and can be relevant to interfacial processes such as solute permeability and contact with solid boundaries or other membranes.

Title: Inverse Bauschinger Effect in Active Ultrastable Glasses
Authors: Rashmi Priya, Smarajit Karmakar
Abstract: Memory effects in amorphous materials have been widely studied because of their possible widespread future applications. We show here that ultrastable glasses can exhibit a transient reversible memory effect when subjected to both a local driving force via Run-and-tumble active particles and global shear. We investigate the system's response across different yielding regimes by selectively switching the shear direction at different strains. We analyze how changes in shear direction influence yielding, post-yield behavior, and structural evolution in active amorphous solids. Our model active system exhibits an enhanced anisotropic response, displaying both conventional and inverse Bauschinger effects, depending on the deformation history. The results indicate that activity-induced shear band networks create structural memory, enabling the system to heal upon shear reversal due to the transient nature of this phenomenon. Additionally, we observe that shear softening under cyclic loading produces an irreversible, stable, and less branched network structure with increasing cycles. These findings provide novel insights into how activity and shear collectively contribute to mechanical response, including memory formation in ultrastable disordered systems.

Title: Weyl group symmetry of q-characters
Authors: Edward Frenkel, David Hernandez
Abstract: We define an action of the Weyl group W of a simple Lie algebra g on a completion of the ring Y, which is the codomain of the q-character homomorphism of the corresponding quantum affine algebra U_q(g^). We prove that the subring of W-invariants of Y is precisely the ring of q-characters, which is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the category of finite-dimensional representations of U_q(g^). This resolves an old puzzle in the theory of q-characters. We also identify the screening operators, which were previously used to describe the ring of q-characters, as the subleading terms of simple reflections from W in a certain limit. Our results have already found applications to the study of the category O of representations of the Borel subalgebra of U_q(g^) in arXiv:2312.13256 and to the categorification of cluster algebras in arXiv:2401.04616.

Title: Quantum Simulation of Two-Dimensional $\mathrm{U(1)}$ Gauge Theory in Rydberg and Rydberg-Dressed Atom Arrays
Authors: Zheng Zhou, Zheng Yan, Changle Liu, Yan Chen, Xue-Feng Zhang
Abstract: Simulating $\mathrm{U(1)}$ quantum gauge theories with spatial dimension greater than one is of great physical significance yet has not been achieved experimentally. Here we propose a simple realization of $\mathrm{U(1)}$ gauge theory on triangular lattice Rydberg atom arrays. Within experimentally accessible range, we find that the effective model well simulates various aspects of the $\mathrm{U(1)}$ gauge theory, such as emergence of topological sectors, incommensurability, and the deconfined Rokhsar-Kivelson point. Our proposal is easy to implement experimentally and exhibits pronounced quantum dynamics compared with previous proposals realizing $\mathrm{U(1)}$ and $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theories.

Title: Phase transitions in in vivo or in vitro populations of spiking neurons belong to different universality classes
Authors: Braden A. W. Brinkman
Abstract: The "critical brain hypothesis" posits that neural circuitry may be tuned close to a "critical point" or "phase transition" -- a boundary between different operating regimes of the circuit. The renormalization group and theory of critical phenomena explain how systems tuned to a critical point display scale invariance due to fluctuations in activity spanning a wide range of time or spatial scales. In the brain this scale invariance has been hypothesized to have several computational benefits, including increased collective sensitivity to changes in input and robust propagation of information across a circuit. However, our theoretical understanding of critical phenomena in neural circuitry is limited because standard renormalization group methods apply to systems with either highly organized or completely random connections. Connections between neurons lie between these extremes, and may be either excitatory (positive) or inhibitory (negative), but not both. In this work we develop a renormalization group method that applies to models of spiking neural populations with some realistic biological constraints on connectivity, and derive a scaling theory for the statistics of neural activity when the population is tuned to a critical point. We show that the scaling theories differ for models of in vitro versus in vivo circuits -- they belong to different "universality classes" -- and that both may exhibit "anomalous" scaling at a critical balance of inhibition and excitation. We verify our theoretical results on simulations of neural activity data, and discuss how our scaling theory can be further extended and applied to real neural data.

Title: MultiCarroll dynamics
Authors: P.-M. Zhang, H-X. Zeng, P. A. Horvathy
Abstract: Unlike a single Carroll particle, a multiparticle Carroll system can move under suitable conditions, as we demonstrate it explicitly for two particles with a momentum-dependent interaction: the center-of-mass remains fixed, however relative motion is possible, confirming previous statements made by Bergshoeff, Casalbuoni, and their collaborators. Analogous results are obtained for electric dipoles with the roles of the center-of-mass and the relative position interchanged.

Title: The allosteric lever: towards a principle of specific allosteric response
Authors: Maximilian Vossel, Bert L. de Groot, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: Allostery, the phenomenon by which the perturbation of a molecule at one site alters its behavior at a remote functional site, enables control over biomolecular function. Allosteric modulation is a promising avenue for drug discovery and is employed in the design of mechanical metamaterials. However, a general principle of allostery, i.e. a set of quantitative and transferable "ground rules", remains elusive. It is neither a set of structural motifs nor intrinsic motions. Focusing on elastic network models, we here show that an allosteric lever -- a mode-coupling pattern induced by the perturbation -- governs the directional, source-to-target, allosteric communication: a structural perturbation of an allosteric site couples the excitation of localized hard elastic modes with concerted long range soft-mode relaxation. Perturbations of non-allosteric sites instead couple hard and soft modes uniformly. The allosteric response is shown to be generally non-linear and non-reciprocal, and allows for minimal structural distortions to be efficiently transmitted to specific changes at distant sites. Allosteric levers exist in proteins and "pseudoproteins" -- networks designed to display an allosteric response. Interestingly, protein sequences that constitute allosteric transmission channels are shown to be evolutionarily conserved. To illustrate how the results may be applied in drug design, we use them to successfully predict known allosteric sites in proteins.

Title: Bi-Hamiltonian in Semiflexible Polymer as Strongly Coupled System
Authors: Heeyuen Koh, Shigeo Maruyama
Abstract: The memory effect, which quantifies the interconnection between the target system and its environment, correlates states between distinct Hamiltonians. In this paper, we propose the diffusion process derived from Smoluchowski equation that can manifest the evolution of memory effect integration in non Markovian regime. The master equation from the Smoluchowski picture, within the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics, justifies the use of the diffusion process. The numerical experiments using collision between semiflexible polymers like single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) confirm the derivation and the justification of the usage of the heat diffusion to compensate the correlated momentum between two Hamiltonians that compose coarse grained system of SWCNT. The diffusion process governs the nonlinear motion in both equilibrium and far from equilibrium states.

Title: Considerations in the use of ML interaction potentials for free energy calculations
Authors: Orlando A. Mendible, Jonathan K. Whitmer, Yamil J. Colón
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) promise to accurately describe the potential energy surface of molecules at the ab initio level of theory with improved computational efficiency. Within MLFFs, equivariant graph neural networks (EQNNs) have shown great promise in accuracy and performance and are the focus of this work. The capability of EQNNs to recover free energy surfaces (FES) remains to be thoroughly investigated. In this work, we investigate the impact of collective variables (CVs) distribution within the training data on the accuracy of EQNNs predicting the FES of butane and alanine dipeptide (ADP). A generalizable workflow is presented in which training configurations are generated with classical molecular dynamics simulations, and energies and forces are obtained with ab initio calculations. We evaluate how bond and angle constraints in the training data influence the accuracy of EQNN force fields in reproducing the FES of the molecules at both classical and ab initio levels of theory. Results indicate that the model's accuracy is unaffected by the distribution of sampled CVs during training, given that the training data includes configurations from characteristic regions of the system's FES. However, when the training data is obtained from classical simulations, the EQNN struggles to extrapolate the free energy for configurations with high free energy. In contrast, models trained with the same configurations on ab initio data show improved extrapolation accuracy. The findings underscore the difficulties in creating a comprehensive training dataset for EQNNs to predict FESs and highlight the importance of prior knowledge of the system's FES.

Title: Viscoelastic Worthington jets & droplets produced by bursting bubbles
Authors: Ayush K. Dixit, Alexandros Oratis, Konstantinos Zinelis, Detlef Lohse, Vatsal Sanjay
Abstract: Bubble bursting and subsequent collapse of the open cavity at free surfaces of contaminated liquids can generate aerosol droplets, facilitating pathogen transport. After film rupture, capillary waves focus at the cavity base, potentially generating fast Worthington jets that are responsible for ejecting the droplets away from the source. While extensively studied for Newtonian fluids, the influence of non-Newtonian rheology on this process remains poorly understood. Here, we employ direct numerical simulations to investigate the bubble cavity collapse in viscoelastic media, such as polymeric liquids. We find that the jet and drop formation are dictated by two dimensionless parameters: the elastocapillary number $Ec$ (the ratio of the elastic modulus and the Laplace pressure) and the Deborah number $De$ (the ratio of the relaxation time and the inertio-capillary timescale). We show that for low values of $Ec$ and $De$, the viscoelastic liquid adopts a Newtonian-like behavior, where the dynamics are governed by the solvent Ohnesorge number $Oh_s$ (the ratio of visco-capillary and inertio-capillary timescales). In contrast, for large values $Ec$ and $De$, the enhanced elastic stresses completely suppress the formation of the jet. For some cases with intermediate values of $Ec$ and $De$, smaller droplets are produced compared to Newtonian fluids, potentially enhancing aerosol dispersal. By mapping the phase space spanned by $Ec$, $De$, and $Oh_s$, we reveal three distinct flow regimes: (i) jets forming droplets, (ii) jets without droplet formation, and (iii) absence of jet formation. Our results elucidate the mechanisms underlying aerosol suppression versus fine spray formation in polymeric liquids, with implications for pathogen transmission and industrial processes involving viscoelastic fluids.

Title: Fast quantum gates for exchange-only qubits using simultaneous exchange pulses
Authors: Irina Heinz, Felix Borjans, Matthew J. Curry, Roza Kotlyar, Florian Luthi, Mateusz T. Mądzik, Fahd A. Mohiyaddin, Nathaniel Bishop, Guido Burkard
Abstract: The benefit of exchange-only qubits compared to other spin qubit types is the universal control using only voltage controlled exchange interactions between neighboring spins. As a compromise, qubit operations have to be constructed from non-orthogonal rotation axes of the Bloch sphere and result in rather long pulsing sequences. This paper aims to develop a faster implementation of single-qubit and two-qubit gates using simultaneous exchange pulses. We introduce pulse sequences in which single-qubit gates could be executed faster and show that subsequences on three spins in two-qubit gates could be implemented in fewer steps. Our findings can particularly speed up gate sequences for realistic idle times between sequential pulses and we show that this advantage increases with more interconnectivity of the quantum dots. We further demonstrate how a phase operation can introduce a relative phase between the computational and some of the leakage states, which can be advantageous for the construction of two-qubit gates. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we experimentally demonstrate and characterize a simultaneous exchange implementation of $X$ rotations in a SiGe quantum dot device and compare to the state of the art with sequential exchange pulses.

Title: Quantifying world geography as seen through the lens of Soviet propaganda
Authors: M.V. Tamm, M. Oiva, K.D. Mukhina, M. Mets, M. Schich
Abstract: Cultural data typically contains a variety of biases. In particular, geographical locations are unequally portrayed in media, creating a distorted representation of the world. Identifying and measuring such biases is crucial to understand both the data and the socio-cultural processes that have produced them. Here we suggest to measure geographical biases in a large historical news media corpus by studying the representation of cities. Leveraging ideas of quantitative urban science, we develop a mixed quantitative-qualitative procedure, which allows us to get robust quantitative estimates of the biases. These biases can be further qualitatively interpreted resulting in a hermeneutic feedback loop. We apply this procedure to a corpus of the Soviet newsreel series 'Novosti Dnya' (News of the Day) and show that city representation grows super-linearly with city size, and is further biased by city specialization and geographical location. This allows to systematically identify geographical regions which are explicitly or sneakily emphasized by Soviet propaganda and quantify their importance.

Title: Anderson Localization in Photonic Time Crystals
Authors: Karthik Subramaniam Eswaran, Ali Emami Kopaei, Krzysztof Sacha
Abstract: Solutions of the wave equations for time-independent disordered media can exhibit Anderson localization where instead of wave propagation we observe their localization around different points in space. Photonic time crystals are spatially homogeneous media in which the refractive index changes periodically in time, leading to the formation of bands in the wave number domain. By analogy to Anderson localization in space, one might expect that the presence of temporal disorder in photonic time crystals would lead to Anderson localization in the time domain. Here, we show that indeed periodic modulations of the refractive index with the addition of temporal disorder lead to Anderson localization in time, where an electromagnetic field can emerge from the temporally modulated medium at a certain moment in time and then decay exponentially over time. Thus, we are dealing with a situation where, in a fluctuating three-dimensional medium, the birth and death of waves can occur, and the mechanism of this phenomenon corresponds to Anderson localization.

Title: Efficient Detection of Strong-To-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking via the Rényi-1 Correlator
Authors: Zack Weinstein
Abstract: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) has recently emerged as a universal feature of quantum mixed-state phases of matter. While various information-theoretic diagnostics have been proposed to define and characterize SWSSB phases, relating these diagnostics to observables which can be efficiently and scalably probed on modern quantum devices remains challenging. Here we propose a new observable for SWSSB in mixed states, called the Rényi-1 correlator, which naturally suggests a route toward scalably detecting certain SWSSB phases in experiment. Specifically, if the canonical purification (CP) of a given mixed state can be reliably prepared, then SWSSB in the mixed state can be detected via ordinary two-point correlation functions in the CP state. We discuss several simple examples of CP states which can be efficiently prepared on quantum devices, and whose reduced density matrices exhibit SWSSB. The Rényi-1 correlator also satisfies several useful theoretical properties: it naturally inherits a stability theorem recently proven for the closely related fidelity correlator, and it directly defines SWSSB as a particular pattern of ordinary spontaneous symmetry breaking in the CP state.

Title: On the non-hermitian Kitaev chain
Authors: Eddy Ardonne, Viktor Kurasov
Abstract: We study the non-hermitian Kitaev chain model, for arbitrary complex parameters. In particular, we give a concise characterisation of the curves of eigenvalues in the complex plane in the infinite size limit, using a novel method which can be applied to other non-hermitian systems. Using this solution, we characterise under which conditions the skin effect is absent, and for which eigenstates this is the case. We also fully determine the region in parameter space for which the model has a zero mode.

Title: Properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states
Authors: Sahel Ashhab, Mohammad Ayyash
Abstract: We analyze the properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states. We find that, in stark contrast to displacement and two-photon squeezing, higher-order squeezing leads to oscillatory dynamics. The state is squeezed in the initial stages of the dynamics but the squeezing reverses at later stages, and the state reverts almost completely back to the initial state. We analyze various quantities to verify that the oscillatory dynamics is physical and not a mathematical artefact. We also show that the maximum squeezing diminishes with increasing squeezing order, rendering the squeezing mechanism increasingly ineffective. Our results provide important rules that can help guide the development of more effective higher-order squeezing techniques.

Title: Toolkit for General 2d Scalar Potential in LCT
Authors: A. Liam Fitzpatrick, Emanuel Katz, Yuan Xin
Abstract: We present efficient algorithms for obtaining the Hamiltonian in Lightcone Conformal Truncation (LCT) for a 2d scalar field with a generic potential. We apply this method to the sine-Gordon and sinh-Gordon models in $1+1d$, and find precise agreement with integrability results when the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the deforming cosine/cosinh potential is in the range $ \Delta \leq 1$. The agreement provides additional evidence for a recent conjecture for how to compute the effective lightcone Hamiltonian in this class of models. In addition, to high precision, we provide the first direct confirmation for the conjectured self-duality of the sinh-Gordon model ($\Delta < 0)$, which relates $\Delta \leftrightarrow 4/\Delta$. As the dimension approaches the upper limit $\Delta=1$ from below, we show analytically that the Hamiltonian matrix elements exactly reproduce those of a free Majorana fermion, demonstrating how bosonization is manifested in the LCT basis. We comment on the possible extension of the approach to $\Delta > 1$.

Title: Critical properties in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark model
Authors: Ji-Long Dong, En-Wen Liang, Shi-Yang Liu, Guo-Qing Zhang, Ling-Zhi Tang, Dan-Wei Zhang
Abstract: We explore the critical properties of the localization transition in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark (AAS) model with quasiperiodic and Stark potentials, where the non-Hermiticity comes from the nonreciprocal hopping. The localization length, the inverse participation ratio and the energy gap are adopted as the characteristic quantities. We perform the scaling analysis to derive the scaling functions of the three quantities with critical exponents in several critical regions, with respect to the quasiperiodic and Stark potentials and the nonreciprocal strength. We numerically verify the finite-size scaling forms and extract the critical exponents in different situations. Two groups of new critical exponents for the non-Hermitian AAS model and its pure Stark limit are obtained, which are distinct to those for the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre model and their Hermitian counterparts. Our results indicate that the Hermitian and non-Hermitian AAS, Aubry-Andre, and Stark models belong to different universality classes. We demonstrate that these critical exponents are independent of the nonreciprocal strength, and remain the same in different critical regions and boundary conditions. Furthermore, we establish a hybrid scaling function with a hybrid exponent in the overlap region between the critical regions for the non-Hermitian AAS and Stark models.

Title: Explicit Pfaffian Formula for Amplitudes of Fermionic Gaussian Pure States in Arbitrary Pauli Bases
Authors: M. A. Rajabpour, M. A. Seifi Mirjafarlou, Reyhaneh Khasseh
Abstract: The explicit computation of amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics, with significant implications for quantum tomography, experimental studies, and quantum dynamics. These calculations are essential for analyzing complex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation probabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in non-standard bases, where exact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In addition to these physical applications, having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem 1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a matrix whose structure reflects the qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a recursive relation (Theorem 2) that connects amplitudes for systems with varying qubit numbers, enabling scalable computations for large systems. Together, these results provide a versatile framework for studying global entanglement, Shannon-Rényi entropies, formation probabilities, and performing efficient quantum tomography, thereby significantly expanding the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems. Finally, we utilize our formalism to determine the post-measurement entanglement entropy, reflecting how local measurements alter entanglement, and compare the outcomes with conformal field theory predictions.

Title: Quantum complexity in gravity, quantum field theory, and quantum information science
Authors: Stefano Baiguera, Vijay Balasubramanian, Pawel Caputa, Shira Chapman, Jonas Haferkamp, Michal P. Heller, Nicole Yunger Halpern
Abstract: Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state or implementing a unitary transformation with limited resources. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. We seek to bridge the approaches of these fields, which define and study complexity using different frameworks and tools. We describe several definitions of complexity, along with their key properties. In quantum information theory, we focus on complexity growth in random quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), we discuss a geometric definition of complexity in terms of geodesics on the unitary group. In dynamical systems, we explore a definition of complexity in terms of state or operator spreading, as well as concepts from tensor-networks. We also outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models, and QFTs including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we explain the proposed relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the holographic anti-de Sitter (AdS)/CFT correspondence.

Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) are the key element of many devices operating at cryogenic temperatures. Development of time-efficient wafer-scale JJ characterization for process optimization and control of JJ fabrication is essential. Such statistical characterization has to rely on room temperature techniques since cryogenic measurements typically used for JJs are too time consuming and unsuitable for wafer-scale characterization. In this work, we show that from room temperature capacitance and current-voltage measurements, with proper data analysis, we can independently obtain useful parameters of the JJs on wafer-scale, like oxide thickness, tunnel coefficient, and interfacial defect densities. Moreover, based on detailed analysis of current vs voltage characteristics, different charge transport mechanisms across the junctions can be distinguished. We exemplary demonstrate the worth of these methods by studying junctions fabricated on 200 mm wafers with an industrially scale-able concept based on subtractive processing using only CMOS compatible tools. From these studies, we find that our subtractive fabrication approach yields junctions with quite homogeneous average oxide thickness across the full wafers, with a spread of less then 3$\,$%. The analysis also revealed a variation of the tunnel coefficient with oxide thickness, pointing to a stoichiometry gradient across the junctions' oxide width. Moreover, we estimated relatively low interfacial defect densities in the range of 70 - 5000$\,$defects/cm$^2$ for our junctions and established that the density increased with decreasing oxide thickness, indicating that the wet etching process applied in the JJs fabrication for oxide thickness control leads to formation of interfacial trap state

Title: Beyond Robertson-Schrödinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs
Authors: Gen Kimura, Aina Mayumi, Hiromichi Ohno, Jaeha Lee, Dariusz Chruściński
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.

Title: Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes
Authors: G.E. Volovik
Abstract: In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordström black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.
