Title: Metastability in the parallel Ising model
Authors: Franco Bagnoli, Tommaso Matteuzzi
Abstract: In this short paper we present some considerations about some parallel implementations of the dynamic (Monte Carlo) version of the Ising model. In some cases the equilibrium distribution of the parallel version does not present the symmetry breaking phenomenon in the low-temperature phase, i.e., the stochastic trajectory originated by the Monte Carlo simulation can jump between the distributions corresponding to both kinds of magnetization, or the lattice can break into two disjoint sublattices, each of which goes into a different asymptotic distribution. In this latter case, by introducing a small asynchronism, we can have a transition towards the standard ferromagnetic (or antiferromagnetic) distribution, with metastable transients.

Title: Central Limit Behavior at the Edge of Chaos in the z-Logistic Map
Authors: Abbas Ali Saberi, Ugur Tirnakli, Constantino Tsallis
Abstract: We focus on the FeigenbaumCoulletTresser point of the dissipative one-dimensional z logistic map. We show that sums of iterates converge to q Gaussian distributions, which optimize the nonadditive entropic functional Sq under simple constraints. We derive a closedform prediction for the entropic index, and validate it numerically via data collapse for typical z values. The formula captures how the limiting law depends on the nonlinearity order and implies finite variance for z larger than 2 and divergent variance for z in between 1 and 2. These results extend edge of chaos central limit behavior beyond the standard case and provide a simple predictive law for unimodal maps with varying maximum order.

Title: Fast hydrogen atom diffraction through monocrystalline graphene
Authors: Pierre Guichard, Arnaud Dochain, Raphaël Marion, Pauline de Crombrugghe de Picquendaele, Nicolas Lejeune, Benoît Hackens, Paul-Antoine Hervieux, Xavier Urbain
Abstract: We report fast atom diffraction through single-layer graphene using hydrogen atoms at kinetic energies from 150 to 1200 eV. High-resolution images reveal overlapping hexagonal patterns from coexisting monocrystalline domains. Time-of-flight tagging confirms negligible energy loss, making the method suitable for matter-wave interferometry. The diffraction is well described by the eikonal approximation, with accurate modeling requiring the full 3D interaction potential from DFT. Simpler models fail to reproduce the data, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of diffraction patterns to atom-surface interactions and their potential for spectroscopic applications.

Title: The Rise of Generative AI for Metal-Organic Framework Design and Synthesis
Authors: Chenru Duan, Aditya Nandy, Shyam Chand Pal, Xin Yang, Wenhao Gao, Yuanqi Du, Hendrik Kraß, Yeonghun Kang, Varinia Bernales, Zuyang Ye, Tristan Pyle, Ray Yang, Zeqi Gu, Philippe Schwaller, Shengqian Ma, Shijing Sun, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Seyed Mohamad Moosavi, Robert Wexler, Zhiling Zheng
Abstract: Advances in generative artificial intelligence are transforming how metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are designed and discovered. This Perspective introduces the shift from laborious enumeration of MOF candidates to generative approaches that can autonomously propose and synthesize in the laboratory new porous reticular structures on demand. We outline the progress of employing deep learning models, such as variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and large language model-based agents, that are fueled by the growing amount of available data from the MOF community and suggest novel crystalline materials designs. These generative tools can be combined with high-throughput computational screening and even automated experiments to form accelerated, closed-loop discovery pipelines. The result is a new paradigm for reticular chemistry in which AI algorithms more efficiently direct the search for high-performance MOF materials for clean air and energy applications. Finally, we highlight remaining challenges such as synthetic feasibility, dataset diversity, and the need for further integration of domain knowledge.

Title: Magnetic and Mossbauer studies of Ca$_x$Zn$_{1-x}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ nanoferrites
Authors: Kemi Y. Adewale, Itegbeyogene P. Ezekiel
Abstract: A one-step synthesis of Ca$_x$Zn$_{1-x}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ (x=0, 0.5 and 1) nanoferrites and nanocomposites by the glycol-thermal method is reported. The structural, morphological and magnetic properties were studied using XRD, HRTEM, HRSEM, Mossbauer spectroscopy and VSM. The XRD patterns show a single phase cubic spinel structure for x=0. A composite phase of a spinel and hematite-like structure was observed for x=0.5, and for x=1, CaFe$_2$O$_4$ has the same structure as hematite. The superparamagnetic nature of the samples was confirmed from the Mossbauer and magnetization results.

Title: Synthesis and Characterization of Mg doped ZnFe$_2$O$_4$
Authors: Kemi Y. Adewale, Itegbeyogene P.Ezekiel
Abstract: Single-phase Mg-doped ZnFe$_2$O$_4$ nanoparticles with x= 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 have been prepared by the glycol-thermal method without any subsequent calcination. The crystallite size, microstructure and magnetic properties of the prepared nanoparticles were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution scanning electron microscope (TEM), Mossbauer spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometer at room temperature. The XRD results revealed the production of a sharp single cubic spinel structure in all the synthesized samples without any impurity peak with the average crystallite size of about 19-28 nm. It was noticed that the lattice parameter varies as the Mg$^{2+}$ ion concentration increases. 57 Mossbauer measurement showed that the nano ferrites exhibit ferrimagnetic and superparamagnetic states. Magnetization measurements confirmed the superparamagnetic behaviour of the samples. The highest coercivity and saturation magnetization were observed at x=0.3. The saturation magnetization (MS) decreases while coercivity (HC) varies with an increase in the concentration of Mg$^{2+}$ ion.

Title: Towards Capacitive In-Memory-computing: A perspective on the future of AI hardware
Authors: Kapil Bhardwaj, Ella Paasio, Sayani Majumdar
Abstract: The quest for energy-efficient, scalable neuromorphic computing has elevated compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures to the forefront of hardware innovation. While memristive memories have been extensively explored for synaptic implementation in CIM architectures, their inherent limitations, including static power dissipation, sneak-path currents, and interconnect voltage drops, pose significant challenges for large-scale deployment, particularly at advanced technology nodes. In contrast, capacitive memories offer a compelling alternative by enabling charge-domain computation with virtually zero static power loss, intrinsic immunity to sneak paths, and simplified selector-less crossbar operation, while offering superior compatibility with 3D Back-end-of-Line (BEOL) integration. This perspective highlights the architectural and device-level advantages of emerging non-volatile capacitive synapses. We examine how material engineering and interface control can modulate synaptic behavior, capacitive memory window and multilevel analog storage potential. Furthermore, we explore critical system-level trade-offs involving device-to-device variation, charge transfer noise, dynamic range, and effective analog resolution.

Title: When Does a Single Repulsive Dirac Cone Superconduct?
Authors: Omid Tavakol, Thomas Scaffidi
Abstract: Superconductivity in a single two-dimensional Dirac cone offers a natural route to topological superconductivity. While usually considered extrinsic -- arising from proximity to a conventional superconductor -- we investigate when a doped Dirac cone can spontaneously develop superconductivity from a short-range repulsive interaction $U$ via the Kohn--Luttinger mechanism. We show that an ideal, linear Dirac cone is immune to pairing at leading order in $U^2$. Superconductivity instead emerges only through higher-order in $k$ corrections to the dispersion, which are unavoidable in any lattice realization and crucially dictate the pairing symmetry. The form of the pairing thus reflects how the well-known obstruction to realizing a single Dirac cone on a lattice is circumvented. When a Dirac cone arises from broken time-reversal symmetry -- for instance, at a transition between Chern insulators or in a valley-polarized phase -- we find a topological $p - ip$ state whose chirality is opposite to that of the parent chiral metal above $T_c$. By contrast, for a surface Dirac cone of a 3D topological insulator, superconductivity is stabilized by anisotropies in the dispersion. For $C_{3v}$-symmetric warping, as in $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{3}$, pairing is strongest when the Fermi surface becomes hexagonal, leading to order in the $(d \pm id)\times(p+ip)$ channel with accidental near-nodes. In the highly anisotropic limit $v_x \gg v_y$, relevant to side surfaces of layered materials, the Fermi surface splits into two branches, and nesting favors a pairing symmetry $\Delta \sim \mathrm{sgn}(k_x)\cos(k_y)$ reminiscent of organic superconductors.

Title: Generalized Brillouin Zone Fragmentation
Authors: Haiyu Meng, Yee Sin Ang, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: The Generalized Brillouin Zone (GBZ) encodes how lattice momentum is complex-deformed due to non-Hermitian skin accumulation, and has proved essential in restoring bulk-boundary correspondences. However, we find that generically, the GBZ is neither unique nor well-defined if more than one skin localization direction or strength exists, even in systems with no asymmetric hoppings. Instead, open boundary condition (OBC) eigenstates become complicated superpositions of multiple competing skin modes from "fragments" of all possible GBZs solutions. We develop a formalism that computes the fragmented GBZ in a scalable manner, with fragmentation extent quantified through our newly-defined composition IPR and spectral relative entropy. GBZ fragmentation is revealed to fundamentally challenge the notion of discontinuous phase transitions, since topological winding contributions from different GBZ fragments can "melt away" at different rates. Phenomenologically, GBZ fragmentation also leads to edge localization in all observables in energetically weighted ensembles such as thermal ensembles. This contrasts with conventional GBZs where the skin localization completely cancels in biorthogonal expectations. Occurring universally in multi-mode non-Hermitian media, as we concretely demonstrate with photonic crystal simulations, GBZ fragmentation points towards a new paradigm that is essential for understanding the band structure and the topological and dynamical properties of diverse generic non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Numerical Simulation of Lead-Free Absorbers in 2D Dion-Jacobson Phase Perovskite Solar Cells Using SCAPS-1D: Towards 41% Efficiency
Authors: Md. Meraz Hasan, Pallab Chakraborty, Fahim Tanvir, Subah Tahsin, Mostafizur Rahaman
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of photovoltaic science, there has been an increasing focus on the development of environment-friendly and structurally advanced perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this context, this study investigates an architectural configuration employing 2D Dion-Jacobson phase perovskites as both electron and hole transport layers within a 2D/absorber/2D structure. The primary objective is to identify optimal absorber materials and enhance the overall efficiency of the device. While the reduction of lead content remains a significant challenge in PSC development, the present work focuses on the evaluation of seven lead-free absorber materials: MASnBr3, Sr3PI3/Sr3SbI3, p-CuBi2O4, p-Si, CH3NH3SnI3, Sb2Se3, and CZTSSe. These materials were assessed in the context of an FTO/PeDAMA8Pb6I19/IDL1/absorber/IDL2/PeDAMA2Pb3I10/C architecture utilizing SCAPS-1D simulation software. The study includes a comprehensive analysis of band alignment, pre-optimization screening, and performance optimization through the adjustment of absorber thickness, doping levels, and defect densities. Additionally, the temperature sensitivity and the substitution of the FTO layer with ITO, IZO, and MZO were also investigated. The simulation results indicated that Sb2Se3 and CZTSSe achieved the highest efficiencies of 41.00% and 41.19%, respectively. Furthermore, MZO was identified as a strong candidate for replacing FTO, maintaining consistent performance across all absorber types analyzed. Overall, this study provides a comparative framework for the material selection within layered PSC architectures and significantly contributes to the advancement of stable, efficient, and lead-free photovoltaic technologies.

Title: Persistence of charge density wave fluctuations in the absence of long-range order in a hole-doped kagome metal
Authors: Terawit Kongruengkit, Andrea N. Capa Salinas, Ganesh Pokharel, Brenden R. Ortiz, Stephen D. Wilson, John W. Harter
Abstract: The kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) exhibit a complex interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. In this study, we use ultrafast coherent phonon spectroscopy to probe the evolution of CDW order in hole-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$ across a broad range of compositions ($0 \leq x \leq 0.68$). While thermodynamic and diffraction measurements show long-range CDW order vanishes above $x \approx 0.05$, we observe persistent signatures of CDW fluctuations up to the highest doping levels, with correlation times on the order of several picoseconds. These results indicate the presence of robust fluctuating charge order that survives well beyond the established CDW phase boundary. Furthermore, these fluctuations are enhanced near a doping-tuned quantum phase transition at $x^* \approx 0.15$, which coincides with a local minimum in the superconducting $T_\mathrm{c}$ double-dome. Additional measurements on Ti- and K-substituted samples confirm that this behavior is intrinsic to hole doping and not tied to disorder. Overall, our findings suggest that CDW fluctuations play a central role in the electronic phase diagram of $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and may mediate or compete with superconductivity.

Title: PBPU Elastomer Network Architecture Determination via Corresponding States Analysis of Mechanical Behavior
Authors: Sushanta Das (Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India Defence Research and Development Organization, New Delhi, India), Hari Ramakrishna Sudhakar (Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India), Hemant Nanavati (Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India)
Abstract: In this work we examine the effect of R=[NCO]/[OH] in the R=<1 regime, on the resultant structural topology of polybutadiene polyurethane (PBPU) elastomer networks based on hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB). We employ stress-elongation behavior and its modeling, as a tool. We examine this property via a combination of our model for the finite chain phantom networks incorporating the HTPB structural information, with the slip-tube model from the literature, suitably modified phenomenologically. We implement a further normalized Mooney-Rivlin (MR) representation (corresponding deformation states plots), to remove any magnitude bias on the model parameters. The now revealed curvatures of all the MR plots, in turn, reveals the non-correlation between the chain size and crosslink density. This discrepancy occurs due to the R-dependent majority presence of network defects due to sol effects (as obtained from swelling experiments) and non-load bearing pendant branches on the load-bearing network chains.

Title: Engineering Hubbard models with gated two-dimensional moiré systems
Authors: Yiqi Yang, Yubo Yang, Miguel A. Morales, Shiwei Zhang
Abstract: Lattice models are powerful tools for studying strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, but their general lack of exact solutions motivates efforts to simulate them in tunable platforms. Recently, a promising new candidate has emerged for such platforms from two-dimensional materials. A subset of moiré systems can be effectively described as a two-dimensional electron gas (2D EG) subject to a moiré potential, with electron-electron interactions screened by nearby metallic gates. In this paper, we investigate the realization of lattice models in such systems. We show that, by controlling the gate separation, a 2D EG in a square moiré potential can be systematically tuned into a system whose ground state exhibits orders analogous to those of the square lattice Hubbard model, including the stripe phase. Furthermore, we study how variations in gate separation and moiré potential depth affect the ground-state orders. A number of antiferromagnetic phases, as well as a ferromagnetic phase and a paramagnetic phase, are identified. We then apply our quantitative downfolding approach to triangular moiré systems closer to current experimental conditions, compare them with the square lattice parameters studied, and outline routes for experimental realization of the phases.

Title: Generalized Algebra Grounded on Nonadditive Entropies
Authors: Leandro Lyra Braga Dognini, Constantino Tsallis
Abstract: A $N$-body system is simple if all associated physically relevant space-time correlations are short-ranged, meaning that their momenta of all orders are finite. Such systems typically have a total number $W$ of admissible microscopic configurations which grows with $N$ as $W(N) \sim \mu^N\;(\mu >1, \, N\to\infty)$. Their thermostatistical properties are known to be satisfactorily handled within Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics. In contrast, a system is complex if one or more associated correlations are long-ranged. The simplest examples of such systems are those for which $W(N) \sim N^\rho\;\;(\rho>0)$. A generalized statistical mechanics grounded on the nonadditive entropic functional $S_q(\{p_{i}\})=k\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \ln_q \frac{1}{p_i} \;\;(q\in \mathbb{R}, \;S_1=S_{BG})$ with $\ln_q z =\frac{z^{1-q}-1}{1-q}$ ($\ln_1 z=\ln z$) satisfactorily handles such systems. Indeed, for equiprobabilities, $S_{q=1-1/\rho}(\{1/W(N)\})=k\ln_{1-1/\rho} W(N) \propto N$. Furthermore, for complex systems, the size of the corresponding phase spaces can be related to the property $\ln_q (x\otimes_q y) =\ln_q x + \ln_q y$, $x,y\geq1$, $q\leq 1$, where $x\otimes_q y=[x^{1-q}+y^{1-q}-1]^{\frac{1}{1-q}}_{+}\;\;(x\otimes_1 y=xy)$, and the $q$-product $\otimes_q$ grounds the definition of a $q$-generalized algebra. Another class of complex systems corresponds to $W(N) \sim \nu^{N^\gamma}\;\;(\nu >1, \,\gamma > 0)$, which appears to be the case of black holes and other cosmological phenomena. This class can be handled with $S_\delta(\{p_{i}\}) = k\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \Bigl(\ln \frac{1}{p_i} \Bigr)^\delta \;\;(\delta>0)$. Finally, we can define $S_{q,\delta}(\{p_{i}\})=k\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \Bigl(\ln_q \frac{1}{p_i} \Bigr)^\delta$ $(q\in\mathbb{R},\delta>0)$, which unifies all the above ones. In this paper, we generalize the $q$-algebra to a new, promising one, namely the $(q,\delta)$-algebra.

Title: A Haldane-Anderson Hamiltonian Model for Hyperthermal Hydrogen Scattering from a Semiconductor Surface
Authors: Xuexun Lu, Nils Hertl, Reinhard J. Maurer
Abstract: Collisions of atoms and molecules with metal surfaces create electronic excitations in the metal, leading to nonadiabatic energy dissipation, inelastic scattering, and sticking. Mixed quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulation methods, such as molecular dynamics with electronic friction, are able to capture nonadiabatic energy loss during dynamics at metal surfaces. Hydrogen atom scattering on semiconductors, on the other hand, exhibits strong adsorbate-surface energy transfer only when the projectile kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the substrate. Electronic friction fails to describe this effect. Here, we report a first-principles parameterization of a simple Haldane-Anderson Hamiltonian model of hydrogen atom gas-surface scattering on $c(2\times8)$Ge(111), for which hyperthermal scattering experiments have been reported. We subsequently perform independent electron surface hopping and Ehrenfest dynamics simulations on this model. Whereas mean-field dynamics yield weak nonadiabatic energy loss that is independent of the initial kinetic energy, independent electron surface hopping simulations qualitatively agree with the experimental observation that nonadiabatic energy dissipation only occurs if the initial kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the surface. We further show how nonadiabatic energy loss affects sticking, which is yet to be experimentally measured.

Title: Fiber bundle model of thermally activated creep failure
Authors: Stefan Hiemer, Paolo Moretti, Stefano Zapperi, Michael Zaiser
Abstract: An equal load sharing fiber bundle model for thermally activated breakdown is developed using transition state theory to describe the rate of elementary failures. The lifetime distribution, average, variance and their asymptotic limits for uniform fiber failure thresholds are derived and found to be in excellent agreement with simulations. The asymptotic scaling with regards to the number of fibers matches analytical approximations in the low temperature limit derived by Roux and co-workers for a model of thermal breakdown by stationary Gaussian noise. For the case of randomly distributed fiber failure strengths, the lifetime distribution is derived as a multidimensional integral with no closed form solution. Simulations with different fiber strength distributions indicate that, in the limit of large fiber numbers, the statistics of bundle lifetimes shows a similar asymptotic scaling for distributed and for uniform thresholds. Fiber breakage by thermal activation occurs in avalanches triggered by individual thermally activated failure events, and the asymptotic avalanche size distribution obtained from the simulations matches earlier theoretical results derived for quasistatic loading.

Title: Expanding the search space of high entropy oxides and predicting synthesizability using machine learning interatomic potentials
Authors: Oliver A. Dicks, Solveig S. Aamlid, Alannah M. Hallas, Joerg Rottler
Abstract: We propose an efficient computational methodology for predicting the synthesizability of high entropy oxides (HEOs) in a large space of possible candidate compounds. HEOs are a growing field with an enormous potential chemical composition space, and yet the discovery of new HEOs is slow and driven by experimental trial-and-error. In this work, we attempt to speed up this process by using a machine learned interatomic potential offering DFT-level accuracy. Our methodology starts by identifying a set of crystal structures and elements for screening, building a large random unit cell of each composition and structure, then relaxing this structure. The most promising candidates are distinguished based on the variance of the individual cation energies, which we introduce as our entropy descriptor, and the enthalpy of mixing, which is used as the enthalpy descriptor. The approach is applied to tetravalent HEOs, and its validity is confirmed by comparison to alternative descriptors and DFT calculations for a set of 7 elements. The search is then extended to a set of 14 elements and three crystal structures, where it successfully identifies the only known stable 4-component HEO in the $\alpha$-PbO$_2$ structure, as well as predicting several new 5-component candidate systems. This approach can straightforwardly be applied to new sets of elements and structures, allowing for the accelerated discovery of new HEOs.

Title: $p$-orbital self-organization of ultracold atoms coupled to optical cavities
Authors: Hui Tan, Pengfei Zhang, Jianmin Yuan, Yongqiang Li
Abstract: Atoms coupled to optical cavities provide a novel platform for understanding high-orbital exotic phenomena in strongly correlated materials. In this study, we investigate strongly correlated ultracold bosonic gases that are coupled to two orthogonally arranged optical cavities and driven by a blue-detuned running-wave laser field. Our results demonstrate that atoms initially in the $s$-orbital state can be scattered into $p_x$- and $p_y$-orbital states in either a symmetric or asymmetric manner, depending on the frequencies of the two cavities. For the symmetric configuration, we observe that atoms are scattered into the $p_x$- and $p_y$-orbitals equally. In the asymmetric case, photons emitted into one cavity mode suppress the scattering into the orthogonal mode. Notably, the coupling of atoms with multiple cavity modes leads to the emergence of high-orbital self-organized phases, accompanied by orbital-density waves that break different symmetries.

Title: Josephson diode effect in nanowire-based Andreev molecules
Authors: Shang Zhu, Yiwen Ma, Jiangbo He, Xiaozhou Yang, Zhongmou Jia, Min Wei, Yiping Jiao, Jiezhong He, Enna Zhuo, Xuewei Cao, Bingbing Tong, Ziwei Dou, Peiling Li, Jie Shen, Xiaohui Song, Zhaozheng Lyu, Guangtong Liu, Dong Pan, Jianhua Zhao, Bo Lu, Li Lu, Fanming Qu
Abstract: Superconducting systems exhibit non-reciprocal current transport under certain conditions of symmetry breaking, a phenomenon known as the superconducting diode effect. This effect allows for perfect rectification of supercurrent, and has received considerable research interest. We report the observation of the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in nanowire-based Andreev molecules, where the time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries of a Josephson junction (JJ) can be nonlocally broken by coherently coupling to another JJ. The JDE can be controlled using both non-local phase and gate voltages. Notably, the non-local phase can induce a sign reversal of the diode efficiency, a manifestation of regulating the probabilities of double elastic cotunneling and double-crossed Andreev reflection. Additionally, the diode efficiency can be further modulated by local and non-local gate voltages, exhibiting a central-peak feature in the gate-voltage space. Our theoretical calculations of the energy spectrum and the Josephson currents align well with the experimental results. These results demonstrate the non-local regulation of the JDE in Andreev molecules, offering significant implications for the control of multi-JJ devices and the development of advanced superconducting devices.

Title: Dislocation-mediated short-range order evolution during thermomechanical processing
Authors: Mahmudul Islam, Killian Sheriff, Rodrigo Freitas
Abstract: Thermomechanical processing alters the microstructure of metallic alloys through coupled plastic deformation and thermal exposure, with dislocation motion driving plasticity and microstructural evolution. Our previous work showed that the same dislocation motion both creates and destroys chemical short-range order (SRO), driving alloys into far-from-equilibrium SRO states. However, the connection between this dislocation-mediated SRO evolution and processing parameters remains largely unexplored. Here, we perform large-scale atomistic simulations of thermomechanical processing of equiatomic TiTaVW to determine how temperature and strain rate control SRO via competing creation ($\Gamma$) and annihilation ($\lambda$) rates. Using machine learning interatomic potentials and information-theoretic metrics, we quantify that the magnitude and chemical character of SRO vary systematically with these parameters. We identify two regimes: a low-temperature regime with weak strain-rate sensitivity, and a high-temperature regime in which reduced dislocation density and increased screw character amplify chemical bias and accelerate SRO formation. The resulting steady-state SRO is far-from-equilibrium and cannot be produced by equilibrium thermal annealing. Together, these results provide a mechanistic and predictive link between processing parameters, dislocation physics, and SRO evolution in chemically complex alloys.

Title: Charge Ordering and Magnetic Exchange in the Ladder-Type Compound NH$_4$V$_2$O$_5$
Authors: Dm. M. Korotin
Abstract: The low-temperature electronic and magnetic properties of NH$_4$V$_2$O$_5$, an isoelectronic analog of the spin-ladder compound $\alpha'$-NaV$_2$O$_5$, are investigated using DFT+$U$ calculations. Two charge-ordering patterns - zigzag and linear chains of V$^{4+}$/V$^{5+}$ ions - are considered. The zigzag configuration is found to be energetically preferred and exhibits insulating behavior with a band gap of 1.7 eV. In this state, magnetic V$^{4+}$ (d$^1$) ions form antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. Calculated exchange interactions reveal strong diagonal (intrarung) and interladder couplings, indicating a complex spin-ladder network. These results suggest that NH$_4$V$_2$O$_5$ retains essential spin-ladder characteristics while displaying new structural and magnetic features arising from the larger size and non-spherical geometry of the NH$_4^+$ ion compared to Na$^+$.

Title: Unified description of spin-lattice coupling: application to thermodynamic properties of the pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet
Authors: Masaki Gen, Hidemaro Suwa, Shusaku Imajo, Chao Dong, Hiroaki Ueda, Makoto Tachibana, Akihiko Ikeda, Koichi Kindo, Yoshimitsu Kohama
Abstract: We present an extended model to describe the spin-lattice coupling, incorporating individual vibrations of bonds and atomic sites alongside distance-dependent exchange interactions. The proposed spin Hamiltonian can be effectively considered as an interpolation between two well-established minimum models, the bond-phonon model and the site-phonon model. The extended model well reproduces successive field-induced phase transitions as well as the thermodynamic properties of a 3-up-1-down state in the pyrochlore-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, including negative thermal expansion, an enhanced magnetocaloric effect, and a sharp specific-heat peak. Our approach is broadly applicable to various spin models, providing a framework for identifying the primary phonon modes responsible for spin-lattice coupling and for understanding complex magnetic phase diagrams.

Title: Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Programmable Origami Metamaterials with Controlled Deployment
Authors: Sukheon Kang, Youngkwon Kim, Jinkyu Yang, Seunghwa Ryu
Abstract: Origami-inspired structures provide unprecedented opportunities for creating lightweight, deployable systems with programmable mechanical responses. However, their design remains challenging due to complex nonlinear mechanics, multistability, and the need for precise control of deployment forces. Here, we present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for both forward prediction and inverse design of conical Kresling origami (CKO) without requiring pre-collected training data. By embedding mechanical equilibrium equations directly into the learning process, the model predicts complete energy landscapes with high accuracy while minimizing non-physical artifacts. The inverse design routine specifies both target stable-state heights and separating energy barriers, enabling freeform programming of the entire energy curve. This capability is extended to hierarchical CKO assemblies, where sequential layer-by-layer deployment is achieved through programmed barrier magnitudes. Finite element simulations and experiments on physical prototypes validate the designed deployment sequences and barrier ratios, confirming the robustness of the approach. This work establishes a versatile, data-free route for programming complex mechanical energy landscapes in origami-inspired metamaterials, offering broad potential for deployable aerospace systems, morphing structures, and soft robotic actuators.

Title: Chiral Phonons in a Cubic Lattice
Authors: Hirokazu Tsunetsugu, Hiroaki Kusunose
Abstract: We have developed a theory for the energy dispersion of chiral phonons in a simplest cubic lattice. Among all the phonon modes, only the optical triplet modes exhibit the intrinsic characteristics of chiral phonons near k=0, and we examine their energy splitting in detail by analyzing the dynamical matrix. To first order in k, the splitting is described by a spin-1 Weyl Hamiltonian, and helicity becomes a good quantum number. It asymptotically coincides with the crystal angular momentum for k parallel <111> up to a global sign. The Hamiltonian incorporates a pseudoscalar coupling constant associated with electric toroidal monopoles, determined by the spatial configuration of the stiffness tensors.

Title: Realization and characterization of an all-bands-flat electronic lattice
Authors: Noah Lape, Simon Diubenkov, L.Q. English, P.G. Kevrekidis, Alexei Andreanov, Yeongjun Kim, Sergej Flach
Abstract: We construct an electronic all-bands-flat (ABF) lattice and experimentally generate compact localized states (CLSs) therein. The lattice is a diamond (rhombic) chain and implemented as a network of capacitors and inductors, as well as voltage inverters (using operational amplifiers) in order to introduce a \(\pi\)-phase flux within each diamond. The network's normal modes split into three flat bands, and the corresponding CLSs can be excited in isolation via a two-node driving at the flat band frequencies. We also examine the role of the lattice edges and their interaction with the CLSs. Finally, we compare the experimental results to tight-binding predictions and obtain very good agreement. This analysis paves the way for further experimental implementations of ABF systems in electric networks, especially with an eye towards exploring their interplay with nonlinearity.

Title: Overcoming Quantum Resistivity Scaling in Nanoscale Interconnects Using Delafossite PdCoO2
Authors: Seoung-Hun Kang, Youngjun Lee, Sangmoon Yoon, JongMok Ok, Mina Yoon, Ho Nyung Lee, Young-Kyun Kwon
Abstract: Continued scaling into the sub 7 nm regime exacerbates quantum limited resistivity in Cu interconnects. We evaluated layered PdCoO2 and explicitly benchmarked it against Cu to identify mechanisms that maintain conductivity under confinement. Using a momentum resolved relaxation time formalism derived from the conductivity tensor, we link k and energy resolved velocities, life times, and mean free paths (MFPs) to thickness dependent resistivity for films and wires. PdCoO2 exhibits quasi 2D transport with high inplane velocities and strongly anisotropic MFPs (15 nm inplane, 3 nm outofplane near EF), whereas Cu shows an isotropic 22 nm MFP. Under identical boundary conditions including a realistic 2 nm liner/diffusion barrier for Cu, PdCoO2 displays suppressed boundary scattering and a much slower resistivity increase from bulk down to sub 30 nm, preserving near bulk conductivity and remaining viable at 2 nm. Thickness trends reveal dual slope changes in PdCoO2 (35 nm and 7 nm) set by anisotropic MFPs, contrasting with the single characteristic scale of Cu (40 nm). The calculated bulk values and scaling curves track available measurements for both materials. These results establish PdCoO2 as a scalable interconnect that outperforms Cu under quantum confinement and provide a quantitative framework to screen layered conductors for next generation nanoelectronic interconnects.

Title: Deterministic N'eel vector switching of altermagnets via magnetic multipole torque
Authors: Seungyun Han, Kyoung-Whan Kim, Hyun-Woo Lee, Suik Cheon
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently emerged as promising materials for next-generation spintronic devices. For their device applications, realizing a single-domain configuration is essential but remains challenging. We theoretically consider injecting magnetic multipoles into altermagnets, which can be achieved by applying an in-plane current to an altermagnet/normal metal bilayer. We demonstrate for $d$-wave altermagnets that the torque generated by the magnetic octupole injection can achieve magnetic-field-free deterministic switching of the altermagnets' Néel vector and transform their multidomain configurations into a single domain. This method allows the switching in diverse altermagnets, thereby facilitating their device applications and fundamental studies. This work also exemplifies the usefulness of magnetic multipole currents.

Title: Experimental Confirmation of Hyperuniformity of torque fluctuations in Frictional Matter
Authors: Jin Shang, Jie Zhang, Itamar Procaccia
Abstract: A recent purely theoretical prediction stated that in frictional granular packings, mechanical balance and material isotropy constrain the stress auto-correlation matrix to be fully determined by two spatially isotropic functions: the pressure and torque auto-correlations. Moreover, and unexpectedly, the torque fluctuations were predicted to be hyperuniform, a condition for the stress auto-correlation to decay as the elastic Green's function. In this Letter we present first experimental evidence for the hyperuniformity of the stress fluctuations. We propose that quite generally the variance of torque fluctuations in a d-dimensional ball of radius R will increase exactly like $R^{d-1}$, satisfying the definition of hyperuniformity.

Title: Unlocking reversible and nonvolatile anomalous valley Hall control through multiferroic van der Waals heterostructures
Authors: Ankita Phutela, Saswata Bhattacharya
Abstract: Achieving external control over the anomalous valley Hall (AVH) effect is essential for advancing valleytronic applications. However, many of the existing approaches suffer from limitations such as irreversibility or volatility. In this work, we propose a general strategy for enabling nonvolatile electrical tuning of the AVH effect by utilizing multiferroic van der Waals heterostructures. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that a heterostructure composed of a ferromagnetic monolayer VSSe and a ferroelectric monolayer Al$_2$S$_3$ permits fine control of valley transport properties. The AVH response in VSSe can be reversibly and nonvolatility switched by reversing the polarization of Al$_2$S$_3$ via an applied electric field. This ferroelectric mechanism ensures a stable valley state even without continuous energy input. Furthermore, the valley polarization can also be inverted through the same polarization switching process, providing a dual degree of control over valley-dependent phenomena. These findings establish a promising pathway toward intrinsically switchable and energy-efficient valleytronic devices.

Title: Real-time bubble nucleation and growth for false vacuum decay on the lattice
Authors: Daan Maertens, Jutho Haegeman, Karel Van Acoleyen
Abstract: We revisit quantum false vacuum decay for the one-dimensional Ising model, focusing on the real-time nucleation and growth of true vacuum bubbles. Via matrix product state simulations, we demonstrate that for a wide range of parameters, the full time-dependent quantum state is well described by a Gaussian ansatz in terms of domain wall operators, with the associated vacuum bubble wave function evolving according to the linearized time-dependent variational principle. The emerging picture shows three different stages of evolution: an initial nucleation of small bubbles, followed by semi-classical bubble growth, which in turn is halted by the lattice phenomenon of Bloch oscillations. Furthermore, we find that the resonant bubble only plays a significant role in a certain region of parameter-space. However, when significant, it does lead to an approximately constant decay rate during the intermediate stage. Moreover, this rate is in quantitative agreement with the analytical result of Rutkevich (Phys. Rev. B 60, 14525) for which we provide an independent derivation based on the Gaussian ansatz.

Title: Unravelling disorder in kagome Yb$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$
Authors: A. Korshunov, C. A. Fuller, C.-Y. Lim, A. Kar, S. Roychowdhury, D. Chernyshov, C. Shekhar, A. Bosak, C. Felser, S. Blanco-Canosa
Abstract: The presence of phonon instabilities that leads to the formation of charge modulated states in kagome metals has allowed their classification based on the atomic displacements. Here, we use diffuse and inelastic x-ray scattering, backed by Monte Carlo simulations to describe a type-I instability in the kagome metal Yb$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$. We find that the in-plane distortion of Co in the kagome plane drives a structural transition with the appearance of new Bragg peaks at odd $L$, which are surrounded by a hexagonal diffuse signal. The anisotropic diffuse scattering, characteristic of a highly frustrated triangular lattice was simulated following a combination of Ising hamiltonian and Lennard-Jones potential, and demonstrate that the structural phase transition in Yb$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$ is of an order-disorder transformation type. The inelastic spectra reveals no softening but an anomalous broadening of the $\Gamma-A$ low energy acoustic mode. Our results highlight the critical role of the geometric frustration in promoting ordering from disorder in kagome lattices and power of diffuse scattering to disentangle the internal atomic displacements and correlated disorder.

Title: Evidence for single variant in altermagnetic RuO2(101) thin films
Authors: Cong He, Zhenchao Wen, Jun Okabayashi, Yoshio Miura, Tianyi Ma, Tadakatsu Ohkubo, Takeshi Seki, Hiroaki Sukegawa, Seiji Mitani
Abstract: Altermagnetism presents intriguing possibilities for spintronic devices due to its unique combination of strong spin-splitting and zero net magnetization. However, realizing its full potential hinges on fabricating single-variant altermagnetic thin films. In this work, we present definitive evidence for the formation of single-variant altermagnetic RuO2(101) thin films with fully epitaxial growth on Al2O3(1-102) r-plane substrates, confirmed through rigorous structural analyses using X-ray diffraction, atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray magnetic linear dichroism. The mutual correspondence of the occupancy of oxygen atoms on the surfaces of RuO2(101)[010] and Al2O3(1-102)[11-20] plays a decisive role in the formation of the single-variant RuO2, which is also supported by our first-principles density functional theory calculations. We further observed spin-splitting magnetoresistance in the single-variant RuO2(101)/CoFeB bilayers, highlighting the characteristic effect of single variant on spin transport. The demonstration of single-variant RuO2(101) films marks a significant advancement in the field of altermagnetism and paves the way for exploring their potential applications.

Title: The properties of the nitrogen-vacancy center in milled chemical vapor deposition nanodiamonds

Abstract: Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) containing negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers are vital for many emerging quantum sensing applications from magnetometry to intracellular sensing in biology. However, developing a scalable fabrication method for FNDs hosting color centers with consistent bulk-like photoluminescence (PL) and spin coherence properties remains a highly desired but unrealized goal. Here, we investigate optimized ball milling of single-crystal diamonds produced via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and containing 2 ppm of substitutional nitrogen and 0.3 ppm of NV- to achieve this goal. The NV charge state, PL lifetime, and spin properties of bulk CVD diamond samples are directly compared to milled CVD FNDs and commercial high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) FNDs. We find that on average, the relative contribution of the NV- charge state to the total NV PL is lower and the NV PL lifetime is longer in CVD FNDs compared to HPHT FNDs, both likely due to the lower Ns0 concentration in CVD FNDs. The CVD bulk and CVD FNDs on average show similar average T1 spin relaxation times of 3.2 $\pm$ 0.7 ms and 4.7 $\pm$ 1.6 ms, respectively, compared to 0.17 $\pm$ 0.01 ms for commercial HPHT FNDs. Our results demonstrate that ball milling of CVD diamonds enables the large-scale fabrication of NV ensembles in FNDs with bulk-like T1 spin relaxation properties.

Title: Uniform electron benchmark for the first-principles $GW_{0}$-Eliashberg theory
Authors: Ryosuke Akashi, Hiroshi Shinaoka
Abstract: We investigate the numerical behavior of the Eliashberg equations for phonon-mediated superconductivity, incorporating normal-state self-energy calculations within the consistent $GW_{0}$ approximation. We account for the full wavenumber and frequency dependences of both the screened Coulomb interaction and phonon-mediated attraction. We present results for the prototypical uniform electron gas system with model Einstein phonons at temperatures of a few kelvin. At extremely low temperatures, we efficiently execute the required convolutions of Green's functions and interactions in Matsubara frequency and wavenumber using intermediate representation and Fourier convolution techniques. In particular, we elucidate the interplay between electron-phonon $\omega$-mass and $k$-mass renormalizations of the electronic self-energy in determining the normal-state effective mass, spectral weight and the superconducting transition temperature. The electron density regimes where the plasmon effect enhances or suppresses the phonon-mediated superconductivity on top of the static Coulomb effect are revealed. We compare our comprehensive Eliashberg calculation results with those from density functional theory for superconductors, where the functionals have been constructed with reference to Eliashberg theory. Our model, methods, and results provide a valuable benchmark for first-principles superconducting calculations that treat screened Coulomb interaction effects non-empirically.

Title: Many-body theory of false vacuum decay in quantum spin chains
Authors: Christian Johansen, Alessio Recati, Iacopo Carusotto, Alberto Biella
Abstract: In this work we theoretically investigate the false vacuum decay process in a ferromagnetic quantum spin-1/2 chain. We develop a many-body theory describing the nucleation and the coherent dynamics of true-vacuum bubbles that is analytically tractable and agrees with numerical matrix product state calculations in all parameter regimes up to intermediate times. This bosonic theory allows us to identify different regimes in the parameter space and unravel the underlying physical mechanisms. In particular, regimes that closely correspond to the cosmological false vacuum decay picture are highlighted and characterized in terms of observable quantities.

Title: Magnetic brightening of light-like excitons in a monolayer semiconductor
Authors: A. Delhomme, T. Amit, P. Ji, C. Faugeras, S. Refaely-Abramson, J.J. Finley, A.V. Stier
Abstract: Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, such as WSe$_2$, are direct gap, multi-valley semiconductors. Long-range electron-hole exchange interactions mix the valleys, yielding dispersion relations for massive ($\propto Q^2$) as well as light-like ($\propto Q$) excitons. We report magneto-photoluminescence spectroscopy of excitons in the monolayer semiconductor WSe$_2$ to $B = \pm25$T. The magnetic field-dependent line shape of the neutral exciton reveals the emergence of a new blue-detuned emission peak in both field orientations. Analyzing the distinct magnetic field-dependent shifts of both peaks facilitates the identification of the emergent feature as a spin-singlet with a significantly smaller reduced exciton mass as compared to the neutral exciton. The intensity of the emergent feature increases with magnetic field according to $\propto B^2$, as expected for a linear dispersion relation. The density-dependent diamagnetic shift ratios of both features follow the expected density dependence of the electron-hole exchange interactions. We interpret our observations within a picture of magnetic-field-induced coupling between the bright massive and quasi dark light-like exciton, leading to its brightening.

Title: Random cubic graph embedded in a hypercube: Entanglement spectrum and many-body localization
Authors: Frantisek Slanina
Abstract: The schematic model of interacting spins is introduced, which combines the symmetry of hypercube with the simplicity of random regular graph with degree three, i.e. the random cubic graph. We study the localization transition in this model, which shares essential characteristics with the systems exhibiting many-body localization. Namely, we investigate the transition in terms of the entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum. We also show that the most significant indicator of the localization transition is the failure of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, when the distribution of matrix elements of local operators changes from Gasussian to bimodal. It also provides good estimate for the critical disorder strength.

Title: Large-scale cooperative sulfur vacancy dynamics in two-dimensional MoS2 from machine learning interatomic potentials
Authors: Aaron Flötotto, Benjamin Spetzler, Rose von Stackelberg, Martin Ziegler, Erich Runge, Christian Dreßler
Abstract: The formation of extended sulfur vacancies in MoS2 monolayers is closely associated with catalytic activity and may also be the basis for its memristive behavior. Nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations using machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) reveal key mechanisms of cooperative vacancy transport, including incorporation of vacancies into clusters of arbitrary size. The simulations provide a coherent atomistic explanation for irradiation-induced vacancy patterns observed experimentally, especially the formation of line defects spanning tens of nanometers. Results and performance are compared of two MLIP frameworks: (i) on-the-fly learning with Gaussian approximation potential, and (ii) fine-tuning of an equivariant foundation model.

Title: Elementary Monte Carlo model of the anisotropic recrystallization and antiripening under intensive stirring and high supersaturations
Authors: Serhii Abakumov, Eugen Rabkin, Andriy Gusak
Abstract: Known method of fibrous oxides production (first of all, V2O5) by intensive stirring in water is treated in the frame of driven systems approach developed in 80s by Georges Martin et al for systems under irradiation or severe plastic deformation. Instead of ballistic diffusion, the ballistic detachments of atoms from the oxide surface under stirring are introduced. Simplified Monte Carlo scheme is suggested for crystal evolution within TLK model, taking into account anisotropy and additional athermal detachment probabilities. Individual cluster in limited volume becomes elongated in steady-state or dissolve. For the ensemble of clusters, the number is decreasing (as in common ripening), but the mean length of fibers grows, as well as the total surface energy (contrary to common ripening).

Title: Extraction of the self energy and Eliashberg function from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy using the \textsc{xARPES} code
Authors: Thomas P. van Waas, Christophe Berthod, Jan Berges, Nicola Marzari, J. Hugo Dil, Samuel Poncé
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is a powerful experimental technique for studying anisotropic many-body interactions through the electron spectral function. Existing attempts to decompose the spectral function into non-interacting dispersions and electron-phonon, electron-electron, and electron-impurity self-energies rely on linearization of the bands and manual assignment of self-energy magnitudes. Here, we show how self-energies can be extracted consistently for curved dispersions. We extend the maximum-entropy method to Eliashberg-function extraction with Bayesian inference, optimizing the parameters describing the dispersions and the magnitudes of electron-electron and electron-impurity interactions. We compare these novel methodologies with state-of-the-art approaches on model data, then demonstrate their applicability with two high-quality experimental data sets. With the first set, we identify the phonon modes of a two-dimensional electron liquid on TiO$_2$-terminated SrTiO$_3$. With the second set, we obtain unprecedented agreement between two Eliashberg functions of Li-doped graphene extracted from separate dispersions. We release these functionalities in the novel Python code \textsc{xARPES}.

Title: Atomistic mechanisms of phase transitions in all-temperature barocaloric material KPF$_6$
Authors: Jiantao Wang, Yi-Chi Zhang, Yan Liu, Hongkun Deng, Mingfeng Liu, Yan Sun, Bing Li, Xing-Qiu Chen, Peitao Liu
Abstract: Conventional barocaloric materials typically exhibit limited operating temperature ranges. In contrast, KPF$_6$ has recently been reported to achieve an exceptional all-temperature barocaloric effect (BCE) via pressure-driven phase transitions. Here, we elucidate the atomistic mechanisms underlying the phase transitions through first-principles calculations and machine-learning potential accelerated molecular dynamics simulations. We identify four distinct phases: the room-temperature cubic (C) plastic crystal characterized by strong fluorine orientational disorder (FOD) and anharmonicity, the intermediate-temperature monoclinic (M-II) phase with decreasing FOD, the low-temperature monoclinic (M-I) phase with suppressed FOD, and the fully ordered rhombohedral (R) phase under pressure. Phonon calculations confirm the dynamic stability of the M-II, M-I, and R phases at 0 K, whereas the C phase requires thermal fluctuations for stabilization. Under pressure, all the C, M-II, and M-I phases transform to the R phase, which are driven by cooperative PF$_6$ octahedral rotations coupled with lattice modulations. These pressure-induced phase transitions result in persistent isothermal entropy changes across a wide temperature range, thereby explaining the experimentally observed all-temperature BCE in this material. Hybrid functional calculations reveal wide-bandgap insulating behavior across all phases. This work deciphers the interplay between FOD, anharmonicity, and phase transitions in KPF$_6$, providing important insights for the design of BCE materials with broad operational temperature spans.

Title: Phase Separation Kinetics in a Polar Active Field Model
Authors: Massimiliano Semeraro, Leticia F. Cugliandolo, Giuseppe Gonnella, Adriano Tiribocchi
Abstract: A milestone of phase separation kinetics is the emergence of universal power laws $\sim t^{1/z}$ governing the domain growth evolution. We investigate a phase-separating polar active model comprising a scalar density field with an advective coupling to a polarization field. Our analysis reveals a novel $\sim t^{0.6}$ regime, which agrees well with the accelerated growth recently observed in simulations of polar active particles. We provide analytical arguments to explain how advection facilitates the creation of topological defects and compresses the domains leading to faster growth. We also show that the $\sim t^{0.6}$ regime is robust to several model generalizations.

Title: Order-Disorder Transitions and Thermal Pathways in Frustrated 2D Colloidal Crystals
Authors: Alexandre Vargas, Thiago Puccinelli, José Rafael Bordin
Abstract: We employ extensive NPT molecular dynamics simulations to explore the thermal transitions of two-dimensional colloidal crystals interacting via a core-softened potential with competing length scales. The system stabilizes three distinct solid phases, namely low-density triangular (LDT), stripe, and kagome, which exhibit markedly different responses to heating and cooling. Our simulations reveal that the LDT and kagome phases melt via first-order transitions, but only the former recrystallizes smoothly. The kagome phase displays strong hysteresis and metastability, while the stripe phase undergoes a continuous and nearly reversible transformation. These results highlight the role of lattice geometry and frustration in shaping non-universal melting and freezing pathways in 2D soft matter.

Title: Observation of relativistic domain wall motion in amorphous ferrimagnets
Authors: Pietro Diona, Luca Maranzana, Sergey Artyukhin, Giacomo Sala
Abstract: Domain walls in magnetic materials are sine-Gordon solitons characterized by relativistic kinematics, with the maximum spin-wave group velocity setting a limit for the domain wall speed and hence the highest operation frequency of magnetic devices. This relativistic regime has been observed only in crystalline iron-garnet ferrimagnets but is in general expected in many magnetic materials. In particular, amorphous rare-earth -- transition metal ferrimagnets should exhibit relativistic effects because of their ultrafast magnetic dynamics. However, no evidence for these effects has been reported in these technologically relevant materials. Here, we show that the relativistic regime can be attained in easy-to-engineer amorphous ferrimagnetic alloys. In GdFeCo we observe a saturation of the current-induced domain wall velocity that is indicative of a maximum spin-wave speed of the order of 2 km/s. Our observations indicate that relativistic dynamics are not exclusive to ferrimagnetic garnets but also exist in rare-earth -- transition-metal ferrimagnets, which provide a robust material platform for future magnetic devices operating at the ultimate speed limit.

Title: Piezomagnetism-driven magnetoelectric coupling in altermagnetic multiferroic K3Cr2F7
Authors: Ying Zhou, Hui-Min Zhang, Cheng-Ao Ji, Hongjun Xiang, Shuai Dong, James M. Rondinelli, Xue-Zeng Lu
Abstract: Ferroelectric control of altermagnetism in momentum space has been studied widely, while the control of magnetism in real space of altermagnets are still rare. We present a design rule to identify multiferroicity in n=2 Ruddlesden-Popper halides. Our results show that a Jahn-Teller distortion can cooperate with oxygen octahedral rotations to break inversion symmetry, which we demonstrate in K3Cr2F7 and cation-ordered KAg2Cu2Cl7, and leads to a ferrielectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition in K3Cr2F7. Altermagnetic spin order in the ferrielectric phase of K3Cr2F7 transforms into a conventional antiferromagnetic order in the ferroelectric phase, at which strain/pressure engineered sizable changes of weak ferromagnetism can occur. Our study is not only conducive to realize strong magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroics, but also reveals more functionalities in altermagnetic materials.

Title: A first-principles theoretical study on two-dimensional MX and MX$_2$ metal halides: bandgap engineering, magnetism, and catalytic descriptors
Authors: Yu-Hsiu Lin, Daniel Maldonado-Lopez, Jose L. Mendoza-Cortes
Abstract: Metal halides, particularly MX and MX$_2$ compounds (where M represents metal elements and X = F, Cl, Br, I), have attracted significant interest due to their diverse electronic and optoelectronic properties. However, a comprehensive understanding of their structural and electronic behavior, particularly the evolution of these properties from bulk to low-dimensional forms, remains limited. To address this gap, we performed first-principles calculations to develop a database of 60 MX and MX$_2$ metal halides, detailing their structural and electronic properties in both bulk and slab configurations. Calculations were performed using the advanced \texttt{HSE06-D3} hybrid functional for density functional theory (DFT), ensuring high precision in predicting material properties despite the associated computational cost. The results reveal that these materials are predominantly semiconductors, but their bandgaps range from 0 to 9 eV. A detailed analysis of the transition from bulk to slab structures highlights notable shifts in electronic properties, including bandgap modifications. Upon dimensional reduction, 9 materials exhibit an indirect-to-direct bandgap transition, enhancing their potential for energy conversion. Beyond structural dimensionality, the influence of chemical composition on bandgap variations was also examined. To further assess their practical applicability, the catalytic and magnetic properties of these metal halides were systematically evaluated. These findings not only illuminate previously underexplored MX and MX$_2$ metal halides but also identify promising candidates for electronic, optoelectronic, catalytic and spintronic applications. This database serves as a valuable resource for guiding future research and technology development in low-dimensional materials.

Title: Originality of resonance and locking phenomena in $φ_{0}$ junction
Authors: M. Nashaat, Yu. M. Shukrinov
Abstract: We demonstrate the realization and interplay of two ferromagnetic resonances in the SFS $\varphi_0$ Josephson junction. One of the resonances that is realized under microwave radiation is the famous Kittel ferromagnetic resonance. The other is the Buzdin ferromagnetic resonance appearing as a result of interaction of superconducting current and ferromagnetic interlayer magnetization. Transformations of one type of resonance to another under variation in the parameters of external radiation and the parameters of the $\varphi_0$ junction open the way to manipulation of the features of ferromagnetic resonances. The combined ferromagnetic resonance that exhibits the features of both resonances is demonstrated too. The 2D-diagrams $\omega_R-I$ for the maximal magnetization component $m_y$ have an interesting intersection points of the Kittel and Buzdin resonances, where the value of $m^{max}_y$ is strongly increased. The obtained results demonstrate reach physics and unique opportunities for various applications.

Title: Electrochemical response of biological membranes to localized currents and external electric fields
Authors: Joshua B. Fernandes, Hyeongjoo Row, Kranthi K. Mandadapu, Karthik Shekhar
Abstract: Electrochemical phenomena in biology often unfold in confined geometries where micrometer- to millimeter-scale domains coexist with nanometer-scale interfacial diffuse charge layers. We analyze a model lipid membrane-electrolyte system where an ion channel-like current flows across the membrane while parallel electrodes simultaneously apply a step voltage, emulating an extrinsic electric field. Matched asymptotic expansions of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations show that, under physiological conditions, the diffuse charge layers rapidly reach a quasi-steady state, and the bulk electrolyte remains electroneutral. As a result, all free charge is confined to the nanometer-scale screening layers at the membrane and electrode interfaces. The bulk electric potential satisfies Laplace's equation, and is dynamically coupled to the interfacial layers through time-dependent boundary conditions. This multiscale coupling partitions the space-time response into distinct regimes. At sufficiently long times, we show that the system can be represented by an equivalent circuit analogous to those used in classical cable theory. We derive closed-form expressions of the transmembrane potential within each regime, and verify them against nonlinear numerical simulations. Our results show how electrode-induced screening and confinement effects influence the electrochemical response over multiple length and time scales in biological systems.

Title: Machine Learning H-theorem
Authors: Ruben Lier
Abstract: H-theorem provides a microscopic foundation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and is therefore essential to establishing statistical physics, but at the same time, H-theorem has been subject to controversy that in part persists till this day. To better understand H-theorem and its relation to the arrow of time, we study the equilibration of randomly oriented and positioned hard disks with periodic boundary conditions. Using a model based on the DeepSets architecture, which imposes permutation invariance of the particle labels, we train a model to capture the irreversibility of the H-functional.

Title: Photoinduced Frustration Modulation in $κ$-type Quantum Spin Liquid Candidates
Authors: M. Tepie, F. Glerean, J. Ovčar, S. Priya, K. Miyagawa, H. Taniguchi, K. Kanoda, I. Lončarić, M. Dressel, M. Mitrano
Abstract: Geometric frustration is a key parameter controlling electronic and magnetic properties of quantum spin liquid systems, yet remains challenging to tune. Here, we coherently drive molecular vibrations with midinfrared pulses in two organic quantum spin liquid candidates, the insulating $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ and the metallic $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_4$Hg$_{2.89}$Br$_8$, and probe their electronic response through ultrafast reflectivity measurements. We observe a nonlinear coupling between local molecular vibrations and nonlocal phonons, which is expected to directly modulate the geometric frustration of their triangular lattice. Our findings establish a promising route to dynamically control frustration in nonbipartite quantum materials.

Title: Fine-Tuning Hydrophilic-Hydrophobic Balance in Stimuli-Responsive PEGPNIPAM Micelles for Controlled Drug Delivery
Authors: Ghazal Jamirad, Mahdi Seif, Abbas Montazeri
Abstract: Temperature-responsive polymeric micelles have great potential in drug delivery, enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity. This study investigates the self-assembly of poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PEG-PNIPAM) block copolymers as nanocarriers for Doxorubicin (DOX) using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations. We systematically examined the effects of polymer chain length and hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance on micelle formation, stability, and drug encapsulation efficiency. PEG-PNIPAM copolymers self-assembled above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), forming stable micelles with varying morphologies. Our findings revealed that PEG enhances micelle hydration and stability, while PNIPAM improves drug retention but may hinder controlled release. Increasing PNIPAM or PEG length significantly increased micelle size, with DOX preferentially localizing in the PEG-rich outer shell, enhancing solubility and preventing aggregation. The DOX diffusion coefficient ranged from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-9}$ cm$^{2}$s$^{-1}$, reflecting drug release dynamics. Structural and thermodynamic analyses confirmed spontaneous DOX encapsulation, with PEG-PNIPAM micelles providing a favorable environment for drug loading. Mean square displacement (MSD), radial distribution function (RDF), and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) analyses highlighted the role of PEG in controlled drug release and PNIPAM in drug binding. These molecular-level insights underscore the potential of fine-tuning PEG-PNIPAM compositions for enhanced drug delivery, paving the way for precision cancer therapies.

Abstract: In photocatalysis, the reusability limit of catalysts can contribute to secondary pollution, posing ecological risks. Addressing this, the present study explores the integration of additive manufacturing with photocatalysis by decorating Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ onto a 3D-printed hematite scaffold (Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$@3DH) for the degradation of cresols. The 3D-printed hematite grid, fabricated via direct ink writing, exhibited excellent rheological behavior ($\tau\gamma = 24$ Pa), allowing precise shape retention. The sintered Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ was subsequently immobilized via a facile dip-coating method. Under optimized conditions, the composite achieved 99.78\% degradation of 20 mg/L p-cresol within 240 min of irradiation. Notably, hematite served as a porous substrate and contributed to photocatalytic activity. Density functional theory simulations with Hubbard correction (DFT+U) indicated an interfacial charge transfer of approximately -0.9 electrons from hematite to Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$, confirming a S-scheme heterojunction between hematite and Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ semiconductors, validating experimental observations. The composite demonstrated strong performance across varied water matrices and in the presence of other cresol isomers. It also retained 84.28\% degradation efficiency after 10 cycles, with negligible catalyst leaching. Furthermore, in vitro and in silico ecotoxicity analyses revealed reduced toxicity of the degradation products. The current work presents a novel and scalable strategy, advancing the use of earth-abundant hematite minerals in sustainable environmental remediation.

Title: "DIVE" into Hydrogen Storage Materials Discovery with AI Agents
Authors: Di Zhang, Xue Jia, Tran Ba Hung, Seong Hoon Jang, Linda Zhang, Ryuhei Sato, Yusuke Hashimoto, Toyoto Sato, Kiyoe Konno, Shin-ichi Orimo, Hao Li
Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures. We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30% relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000 entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials discovery.

Title: Towards Routine Condensed Phase Simulations with Delta-Learned Coupled Cluster Accuracy: Application to Liquid Water
Authors: Niamh O'Neill, Benjamin X. Shi, William Baldwin, William C. Witt, Gábor Csányi, Julian D. Gale, Angelos Michaelides, Christoph Schran
Abstract: Simulating liquid water to an accuracy that matches its wealth of available experimental data requires both precise electronic structure methods and reliable sampling of nuclear (quantum) motion. This is challenging because applying the electronic structure method of choice - coupled cluster theory with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] - to condensed phase systems is currently limited by its computational cost and complexity. Recent tour-de-force efforts have demonstrated that this accuracy can indeed bring simulated liquid water into close agreement with experiment using machine learning potentials (MLPs). However, achieving this remains far from routine, requiring large datasets and significant computational cost. In this work, we introduce a practical approach that combines developments in MLPs with local correlation approximations to enable routine CCSD(T)-level simulations of liquid water. When combined with nuclear quantum effects, we achieve agreement to experiments for structural and transport properties. Crucially, this approach extends beyond constant volume to constant pressure simulations, allowing fundamental properties such as the density to now be predicted by MLP-based CCSD(T) models. Importantly, the approach also handles constant pressure simulations, enabling MLP-based CCSD(T) models to predict isothermal-isobaric bulk properties, such as water's density maximum in close agreement with experiment. Encompassing tests across electronic structure, datasets and MLP architecture, this work provides a practical blueprint towards routinely developing CCSD(T)-based MLPs for the condensed phase.

Title: Autoregressive Typical Thermal States
Authors: Tarun Advaith Kumar, Leon Balents, Timothy H. Hsieh, Roger G. Melko
Abstract: A variety of generative neural networks recently adopted from machine learning have provided promising strategies for studying quantum matter. In particular, the success of autoregressive models in natural language processing has motivated their use as variational ansätze, with the hope that their demonstrated ability to scale will transfer to simulations of quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we introduce an autoregressive framework to calculate finite-temperature properties of a quantum system based on the imaginary-time evolution of an ensemble of pure states. We find that established approaches based on minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) have numerical instabilities when an autoregressive recurrent neural network is used as the variational ansätz. We show that these instabilities can be mitigated by evolving the initial ensemble states with a unitary operation, along with applying a threshold to curb runaway evolution of ensemble members. By comparing our algorithm to exact results for the spin 1/2 quantum XY chain, we demonstrate that autoregressive typical thermal states are capable of accurately calculating thermal observables.

Title: A blueprint for experiments exploring the Poincaré quantum recurrence theorem
Authors: Bayan Karimi, Xuntao Wu, Andrew N. Cleland, Jukka P. Pekola
Abstract: The quantum form of the Poincaré recurrence theorem stipulates that a system with a time-independent Hamiltonian and discrete energy levels returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a finite time. Qubit systems, being highly isolated from their dissipative surroundings, provide a possible experimental testbed for studying this theoretical construct. Here we investigate a $N$-qubit system, weakly coupled to its environment. We present quantitative analytical and numerical results on both the revival probability and time, and demonstrate that the system indeed returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a time exponential in the number of qubits $N$. The revival times become astronomically large for systems with just a few tens of qubits. Given the lifetimes achievable in present-day superconducting multi-qubit systems, we propose a realistic experimental test of the theory and scaling of Poincaré revivals.

Title: Asymptotic freedom of dephased charging
Authors: Chayan Purkait, B. Prasanna Venkatesh, Gentaro Watanabe
Abstract: Quantum batteries, small-scale energy storage devices based on quantum systems, offer the potential for enhanced charging performance through quantum effects such as coherence and collectivity. In this work, we study the collective charging of a quantum battery consisting of N qubits, coupled to a driven qubit charger in a star configuration, with controlled pure dephasing acting on the charger. We investigate how an "asymptotic freedom"-like behavior, in which all the energy deposited into the battery can be extracted as work, resulting in the ergotropy-to-energy ratio approaching unity, can emerge in the steady state of the battery. We show that the ergotropy-to-energy ratio increases with the number of qubits and approaches unity asymptotically as 1 - O(1/N). In the large-N limit, the emergence of approximate ground-state degeneracy of the collective battery system leads to this asymptotic freedom behavior, despite the battery state remaining mixed. We also discuss the scaling behavior of the charging time of the battery with N.

Title: Coupling of radial multiple SLE with Gaussian free field, and the hydrodynamic limit
Authors: Makoto Katori, Shinji Koshida, Chizuru Soukejima, Raian Suzuki
Abstract: Schramm--Loewner evolution (SLE) has been one of the central topics in the probabilistic study of two-dimensional critical systems. It is a random curve in two dimensions to which a cluster interface in a critical lattice system is supposed, or has been proved, to converge. The most archetypical setting for SLE is called chordal, where a random curve evolves in a simply-connected domain from a boundary point to another, whereas in its variant called radial, a random curve evolves from a boundary point to a distinguished interior point. Multiple SLE is a variant to another direction; it deals with multiple random curves, and it is a natural direction as there are certainly multiple cluster interfaces found in critical lattice systems. In this paper, we study multiple SLE in the radial setting, namely, radial multiple SLE. We report two main results. One is regarding coupling between radial multiple SLE and Gaussian free field (GFF). Coupling between SLE and GFF has been extensively studied in the chordal setting, and serves as a foundation for many recent developments. We show that coupling between radial multiple SLE and GFF occurs if and only if the radial multiple SLE is driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motions. The circular Dyson Brownian motions is a typical example of stochastic log-gas. This fact motivates us to study the hydrodynamic limit of the corresponding radial multiple SLE, which refers to the dynamical law of large numbers, when the number of curves tends to infinity. In our other main result, we provide explicit description of the hydrodynamic limit.

Title: Diffuse-Layer Capacitance at the Potential of Zero Charge in Binary Mixtures
Authors: Yuki Uematsu
Abstract: The capacitance of the electric double layer has potential applications in supercapacitors, and theoretical investigations of the double-layer capacitance in binary mixtures are important. In this work, we develop the theory of the electric double layer in binary mixtures, and the diffuse-layer capacitance at the potential of zero charge is obtained analytically. Furthermore, we observe a divergence of the capacitance in the phase diagram, suggesting a surface instability. The obtained capacitance is different from that derived using single-liquid approximation unless the preferential solvation energies of cations and anions are the same. When the system is close to the surface instability line, the capacitance strongly deviates from the results of single-liquid approximation.

Title: Statistical-Mechanical Theory on the Probability Distribution Function for the Net Charge of an Electrolyte Droplet
Authors: Yuki Uematsu, Keiju Suda
Abstract: Droplets of electrolyte solutions in an insulating medium are ubiquitous in nature. The net charges of these droplets are normally nonzero, and they fluctuate. However, a theory on the probability distribution function for the net charge of droplets is lacking, so far. Thus, a statistical-mechanical theory of a charged droplet is developed with including the effect of the electrostatic energy of charging as well as the random distribution of ions. Then, the probability distribution function for the net charge of an electrolyte droplet is calculated assuming that it is generated from a macroscopic solution with the different cation and anion concentrations. Using the Gaussian approximation and Stirling's formula, the analytic results for the average and variance of the net charge of a droplet are obtained.

Title: The Hidden Role of Anisotropies in Shaping Structure Formation in Cosmological N-Body Simulations
Authors: Francesco Sylos Labini
Abstract: Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically generated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a correlated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the Zel'dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point statistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces subtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These anisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through directional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances. Analyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with varying resolutions, initial redshifts, and box sizes, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but are amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that persist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our findings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts -- emerging from the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice -- not genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model. These results underscore the importance of critically reassessing how initial conditions are constructed, particularly when probing the large-scale, quasi-linear regime of structure formation.

Title: Stochastic synaptic dynamics under learning
Authors: Jakob Stubenrauch, Naomi Auer, Richard Kempter, Benjamin Lindner
Abstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which drives and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored. We conclude with a discussion of the many directions in which our framework can be extended.

Title: Modification of adhesion between microparticles and engineered silicon surfaces
Authors: Fabian Resare, Somiya Islam Soke, Witlef Wieczorek
Abstract: A key challenge in performing experiments with microparticles is controlling their adhesion to substrates. For example, levitation of a microparticle initially resting on a surface requires overcoming the surface adhesion forces to deliver the microparticle into a mechanical potential acting as a trap. By engineering the surface of silicon substrates, we aim to decrease the adhesion force between a metallic microparticle and the silicon surface. To this end, we investigate different methods of surface engineering that are based on chemical, physical, or physio-chemical modifications of the surface of silicon. We give quantitative results on the detachment force, finding a correlation between the water contact angle and the mean detachment force, indicating that hydrophobic surfaces are desired for low microparticle adhesion. We develop surface preparations decreasing the mean detachment force by more than a factor of three, or the force at which 50% of particles move by more than a factor of six, the compared to an untreated silicon surface. Our results will enable reliable levitation of microparticles and are relevant for experiments requiring low adhesion between microparticles and a surface.

Title: Analytical phase boundary of a quantum driven-dissipative Kerr oscillator from classical stochastic instantons
Authors: Théo Sépulcre
Abstract: The framework of Keldysh path integral concisely describes quantum systems driven away from thermal equilibrium, such as the two-photon driven Kerr oscillator. Within the thermodynamic limit of diverging photon occupation, we map it to a Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis path integral, and obtain a purely classical, stochastic equivalent where photon self-interaction plays the role of temperature. This perspective sheds light on the difficulties encountered in the search for an effective thermodynamic potential to describe the bistability of the model. It allows us to estimate the bistable tunneling rates using a real-time instanton technique leading to an analytical expression of the phase boundary, the first-ever to our knowledge. It opens the way to powerful semi-analytical techniques to be applied to various quantum optics models displaying bistability.

Title: Quantum Chaos Diagnostics for Open Quantum Systems from Bi-Lanczos Krylov Dynamics
Authors: Matteo Baggioli, Kyoung-Bum Huh, Hyun-Sik Jeong, Xuhao Jiang, Keun-Young Kim, Juan F. Pedraza
Abstract: In Hermitian systems, Krylov complexity has emerged as a powerful diagnostic of quantum dynamics, capable of distinguishing chaotic from integrable phases, in agreement with established probes such as spectral statistics and out-of-time-order correlators. By contrast, its role in non-Hermitian settings, relevant for modeling open quantum systems, remains less understood due to the challenges posed by complex eigenvalues and the limitations of standard approaches such as singular value decomposition. Here, we demonstrate that Krylov complexity, computed via the bi-Lanczos algorithm, effectively identifies chaotic and integrable phases in open quantum systems. The results align with complex spectral statistics and complex spacing ratios, highlighting the robustness of this approach. The universality of our findings is further supported through studies of both the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles.

Title: Circulation Fluctuations of Elementary Turbulent Vortices
Authors: L. Moriconi, R.M. Pereira
Abstract: Thin vortex tubes, with core sizes within the dissipation range, profuse in a homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow. Their intersections with an arbitrary plane define, as a mathematical construct, a dilute gas of localized, intermittently distributed, two-dimensional vortex spots. While their planar density fluctuations are described by a field-theoretical extension of log-normal single-point statistics, known as Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC), they carry circulations which are Gaussian-correlated throughout the inertial range. It is puzzling, then, to find that the circulations of individual vortices are fat-tailed distributed, an apparent paradox that we fix within the GMC framework. The solution, validated through the examination of direct numerical simulation data for a broad range of Reynolds numbers, unveils, as a surprising phenomenological result, an existing coupling between the circulation of vortex structures and the short-distance properties of their spatial distribution fluctuations at sub-Taylor microscales.

Title: Programmable Anyon Mobility through Higher Order Cellular Automata
Authors: Jie-Yu Zhang, Peng Ye
Abstract: Controlling anyon mobility is critical for robust quantum memory and understanding symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases with subsystem symmetries (e.g., line-like, fractal, chaotic, or mixed supports). However, a unified framework for anyon mobility in SET phases with such diverse geometric patterns of symmetry supports has remained a major challenge. In this Letter, by introducing higher-order cellular automata (HOCA) -- a powerful computer science tool -- to SET physics, we establish a unified approach for complete characterization of anyon mobility induced by the complexity of subsystem symmetries. First, we design finite-depth HOCA-controlled unitary quantum circuits, yielding exactly solvable SET models with Abelian anyons and all possible locally generated subsystem symmetries. Then, we present a theorem that precisely programs all excitation mobilities (fractons, lineons, or fully mobile anyons) directly from the HOCA rule, representing the first complete characterization of anyon mobility in SET phases. As a corollary, this theorem yields symmetry-enriched fusion rules which govern mobility transmutation during fusion. Fusion rules with multiple channels are identified, exhibiting non-Abelian characteristics in Abelian anyon systems. Leveraging HOCA, this Letter opens new avenues for characterization of SET phases of matter and programmability of topological quantum codes.

Title: Universal optical polarizability for plasmonic nanostructures
Authors: Tigran V. Shahbazyan
Abstract: We develop an analytical model for calculation of optical spectra for metal nanostructures of arbitrary shape supporting localized surface plasmons (LSPs). For plasmonic systems with characteristic size below the diffraction limit, we obtain an explicit expression for optical polarizability that describes the lineshape of optical spectra solely in terms of the metal dielectric function and LSP frequency. The amplitude of the LSP spectral band is determined by the effective system volume that, for long-wavelength LSPs, can significantly exceed the physical volume of metal nanostructure. Within the quasistatic approach, we derive the exact LSP Green's function and establish general spectral properties of LSPs, including the distribution and oscillator strength of the LSP states. These results can be used to model or interpret the experimental spectra of plasmonic nanostructures and to tune their optical properties for various applications.

Title: Phantom Networks of Finite Chains
Authors: Hemant Nanavati (Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India), Sushanta Das (Defence Research and Development Organization, New Delhi, India)
Abstract: Molecular chains of elastomer networks are modeled as ideal, finite, Freely Jointed Chains (FJCs). We first develop a compact, closed-form, mathematically accurate representation of this model. We begin with the closed form of the Pade-like approximations for the Inverse Langevin Function, modified by the method by Slater (2003), to map to the ideal FJC model. We fit the generalized form of this expression to exact the series expression by Treloar (1975) for the probability density function. The resulting fit yields the exact expression with respect to the Treloar expression. We verify this exact fit from the precise correlation of the moments from the fitted probability distribution with the analytical FJC distribution moments. These expressions are incorporated into the 8-chain geometry, to yield the affine network elasticity expression. We extend the exact and compact expression of an ideal FJC to determine the fluctuation distribution (about its mean position), of the junction between two ideal FJCs. The fluctuation is the conditional probability of the junction, given the separation of the distal points of the connected FJCs. The fluctuation distribution corresponds to an ideal FJC, whose effective number of segments, decreases linearly with the distal end separation. Finally, we develop the elasticity relationship for such an ideal network whose junctions can fluctuate to reduce the strain energy density. However, this reduction itself decreases with deformation, which is incorporated in developing the elasticity expression for a phantom network of finite chains.

Title: Emergence of spin-phonon coupling in a Gd-doped Y$_2$CoMnO$_6$ double perovskite oxide: a combined experimental and ab-initio study
Authors: Anasua Khan, Debdatta Banerjee, Divya Rawat, T.K Nath, Ajay Soni, Swastika Chatterjee, A.Taraphder
Abstract: We present Raman spectroscopy results backed by first-principles calculations and investigate the nature of possible spin-phonon coupling (SPC) in a Gd-doped Y$_2$CoMnO$_6$ (YGCMO) double perovskite oxide. The influence of Gd substitution, A-site ordering, and anti-site disorder is also studied. YGCMO exhibits anti-site disorder leading to both ferromagnetic (between Co and Mn) and antiferromagnetic interactions (Co-Co, Mn-Mn, Gd-Co/Mn), making the SPC quite intriguing. An analysis of the temperature-dependent phonon frequencies for the stretching modes of YGCMO indicates that SPC here possibly emerges from the simultaneous presence of competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. The SPC strength comes out to be 0.29 cm$^{-1}$. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that Phonon modes shifted towards lower frequency with Gd doping. Similarly, A-site ordring and anti-site disorder significantly alter the Raman spectra. Experimental findings are also corroborated by first-principles DFT calculations, which indicate that anti-site disorder and Gd doping enhances SPC in YGCMO. This implies a strong influence of A-site cationic radii, and B-site (Co/Mn) ordering on SPC in the bulk double perovskite systems. The phonon dynamics of YGCMO are, therefore, correlated with magnetic ordering, indicating potential applications in spintronics devices.

Title: Origin of unexpected weak Gilbert damping in the LSMO/Pt bilayer system
Authors: Pritam Das, Pushpendra Gupta, Seung-Cheol Lee, Subhankar Bedanta, Satadeep Bhattacharjee
Abstract: This study presents a first-principles and semiclassical analysis of the puzzling observation that a La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) thin film exhibits larger Gilbert damping than an LSMO/Pt bilayer, contrary to conventional spin-pumping expectations. Density functional theory with Wannier interpolation yields an intrinsic damping of $\alpha_{\mathrm{int}}^{\mathrm{LSMO}}\!\approx\!1.4\times10^{-3}$, supporting an extrinsic origin of the high experimental value. Guided by the self-induced inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) demonstrated in LSMO [Gupta et al., this http URL. B 109, 014437 (2024)], we argue that the large spin Hall angle $|\theta_{\mathrm{SH}}|\simeq 0.093$ and low longitudinal conductivity of LSMO enable an efficient conversion of spin current to charge current boosting the effective damping. In the LSMO/Pt heterostructure the Pt cap shunts the charge current, raising $\sigma_{xx}$ and reducing the interfacial $|\theta_{\mathrm{SH}}|$ to~0.007. A Valet-Fert analysis for layer-resolved ab-initio spin accumulation gives the Pt spin-diffusion length and a non-negligible antidamping SOT coefficient, qualitatively accounting for the observed damping reduction under current bias. The seemingly anomalous damping hierarchy is thus reconciled without invoking additional interfacial mechanisms. The distinct length scales governing spin-pumping normalization, namely, the short absorption depth relevant to self-pumping in a single LSMO film versus the full magnetic thickness applicable to an LSMO/Pt bilayer, are crucial in this context. This observation suggests a practical design strategy: by simultaneously tuning the spin Hall-to-longitudinal conductivity ratio and the spin-diffusion length, one can engineer heterostructures with minimized magnetic losses for spin-orbitronics applications.

Title: Entanglement in dual unitary quantum circuits with impurities
Authors: Shachar Fraenkel, Colin Rylands
Abstract: Bipartite entanglement entropy is one of the most useful characterizations of universal properties in a many-body quantum system. Far from equilibrium, there exist two highly effective theories describing its dynamics -- the quasiparticle and membrane pictures. In this work we investigate entanglement dynamics, and these two complementary approaches, in a quantum circuit model perturbed by an impurity. In particular, we consider a dual unitary quantum circuit containing a spatially fixed, non-dual-unitary impurity gate, allowing for differing local Hilbert space dimensions to either side. We compute the entanglement entropy for both a semi-infinite and a finite subsystem within a finite distance of the impurity, comparing exact results to predictions of the effective theories. We find that for a semi-infinite subsystem, both theories agree with each other and the exact calculation. For a finite subsystem, however, both theories qualitatively differ, with the quasiparticle picture predicting a non-monotonic growth in contrast to the membrane picture. We show that such non-monotonic behavior can arise even in random chaotic circuits, shedding light on the range of validity of the membrane picture in such systems.

Title: Current density distribution for the quantum Hall effect
Authors: Serkan Sirt, Stefan Ludwig
Abstract: Our microscopic understanding of the integer quantum Hall effect is still incomplete. For decades, there has been a controversial discussion about "where the current flows" if the Hall resistance is quantized. Here, we qualitatively analyze the current density distribution in a Hall bar based on the screening properties of a two-dimensional electron system in the quantum Hall regime. Beyond previous publications, we include a closed loop persistent current that exists inside a Hall bar if the Hall resistance is quantized. We find, that the persistent current density decreases with increasing Hall voltage. Accounting for this dependence, we find, that the current flows in the opposite directions along opposite edges of the Hall bar, while the imposed current flows unidirectionally and only on the side of the Hall bar connected with its higher electrical potential edge.

Title: mumax+: extensible GPU-accelerated micromagnetics and beyond
Authors: Lars Moreels, Ian Lateur, Diego De Gusem, Jeroen Mulkers, Jonathan Maes, Milorad V. Milošević, Jonathan Leliaert, Bartel Van Waeyenberge
Abstract: We present mumax+, an extensible GPU-accelerated micromagnetic simulator with a Python user interface, to address the challenges posed by current magnetism research into systems with complex magnetic ordering and interfaces. It is a general solver for the space- and time-dependent evolution of the magnetization and related vector quantities, using finite difference discretization. Here, we present its application and design and discuss features not available in \mumaxthree{}, such as the modeling of antiferromagnets with magnetoelastic coupling. As an illustration of its capabilities, we use \mumaxp{} to simulate state of the art magnetic systems. Specifically, we demonstrate the current induced domain wall motion in a polycrystalline antiferromagnet, we simulate the working principle of a strain-driven antiferromagnetic racetrack memory and we reproduce experimentally observed domain structures in a non-collinear antiferromagnet.

Title: Quantum phases and transitions of bosons on a comb lattice
Authors: Leo Radzihovsky, Emil Pellett
Abstract: Motivated to elucidate the nature of quantum phases and their criticality when entangled with a correlated quantum bath, we study interacting bosons on a "comb lattice" -- a one-dimensional backbone (system) coupled at its sites to otherwise independent one-dimensional "teeth" chains (bath). We map out the corresponding phase diagram, detailing the nature of the phases and phase transitions. Controlled by the backbone and teeth hopping amplitudes, on-site interaction and chemical potential, phases include a Mott-insulator (MI), backbone (LLb) and teeth (LLp) Luttinger liquids, and the long-range ordered incoherent superfluid (iSF). We explore their properties and potential realizations in condensed matter and cold-atom experiments and simulations.

Title: Tunable superconducting diode effect in a topological nano-SQUID
Authors: Ella Nikodem, Jakob Schluck, Max Geier, Michal Papaj, Henry F. Legg, Junya Feng, Mahasweta Bagchi, Liang Fu, Yoichi Ando
Abstract: A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect marks the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI-nanowire-based Josephson junction.

Title: Thermodynamics of a compressible lattice gas crystal: Generalized Gibbs-Duhem equation and adsorption
Authors: Michiel Sprik
Abstract: Compressible lattice gas models are used in material science to understand the coupling between composition and strain in alloys. The seminal work in this field is the 1973 Larché-Cahn paper (Acta Metall. 21, 1051-1063). Single-phase crystals in Larché-Cahn theory are stable under open constant pressure, constant temperature conditions. The Gibbs free energy does not have to match the product $\mu N$ of the number of particles $N$ and their chemical potential $\mu$. Similarly, the grand potential and the product $pV$ of pressure and volume $V$ may not add up to zero. Discrepancies already arise under hydrostatic stress. The elastic energy is not proportional to volume and the Gibbs-Duhem relation valid for liquids is violated. Extensivity is recovered by treating the number of lattice sites $M$ as an additional thermodynamic variable. The difference $ G-\mu N $ can be identified with $\nu M$ where $\nu$ is the thermodynamic force conjugate to $M$. The reinstated Gibbs-Duhem equation can be cast in the form of an adsorption equation and applied to quantify the tendency to vacancy creation under isothermal isobaric conditions. We have worked this out for a uniform one-component compressible lattice gas crystal. Shear stress is omitted. The coupling between composition and strain is implemented by decomposing pressure in a mechanical component depending on deformed density $N/V$ and an elastic term linear in the volume strain as determined by $V/M$. Various $\left( \mu, p, T \right) $ response functions are compared to the $\left( \mu, V, T \right) $ counterparts.

Title: Detecting Many-Body Scars from Fisher Zeros
Authors: Yuchen Meng, Songtai Lv, Yang Liu, Zefan Tan, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of certain interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra, and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e., the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$ plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the return amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate the key difference between QMBS and strong ergodicity breaking including their distinctive renormalization group flows on the complex $\beta$ plane. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of spotting scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.

Title: Absence of orbital current torque in Ta/ferromagnet bilayers
Authors: Qianbiao Liu, Lijun Zhu
Abstract: It has become a heated debate as to whether the orbital Hall effect of a material could generate a non-local orbital current and a non-zero spin-orbit torque on an adjacent magnetic layer. Here, we report unambiguous evidence that, regardless of the ferromagnets (FMs) (e.g., Ni, Ni81Fe19, Fe, Fe60Co20B20, and FePt), the spin-orbit torque generated by an adjacent Ta, which is predicted to have a 50 times greater positive orbital Hall conductivity than the negative spin Hall conductivity, has essentially the same, negative efficiency, in agreement with the spin Hall effect of Ta being the only source of the interfacial torque. We identify that the constant, positive estimate of the torque of the Ta/FM samples from spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) analysis in a specific FM thickness range (>2 nm for Ni), that was heavily cited in the literature to signify an orbital current torque but strongly disagrees with the fairly long relaxation length in other orbital current torque claims, results from the overlook of a significant thick-dependent self-induced ST-FMR signal of the FM. These results indicate the absence of orbital current torque in Ta/ferromagnet systems, regardless of the type and the layer thickness of the ferromagnets.

Title: Ultra-stretchable and Self-Healable Vitrimers with Tuneable Damping and Mechanical Response
Authors: Jiaxin Zhao, Nicholas J. Warren, Richard Mandle, Peter Hine, Daniel J Read, Andrew J. Wilson, Johan Mattsson
Abstract: Vitrimers are a relatively new class of polymer materials with unique properties offered by cross-links that can undergo associative exchange dynamics. We here present a new class of vitrimers based on poly(methyl acrylate) with cross-links utilising dioxaboralane metathesis. These vitrimers demonstrate a combination of ultra-stretchability (up to $\sim$ 80 times their own length), mechanical toughness ($\sim$ 40 MJ/m$^3$), and thermal stability up to $T\sim$ 250 °C; moreover, the vitrimers demonstrate excellent mechanical damping characterised by a loss factor ($\tan(\delta)$) with a maximum of $\sim$ 2-3 and an effective value $>$0.3 across five decades in frequency (0.001-100 Hz), or correspondingly across a $T$-range of $\sim$ 35 °C near room temperature (for a probe frequency of 1 Hz). The vitrimers can be successfully re-processed using both a thermo-mechanical and a chemical processing route, and can for low cross-link density self-heal at room temperature, making them suitable for sustainable applications. The material properties are directly tuneable by variation of both the amount of cross-linker and by the degree of curing. Thus, this class of vitrimers are promising for applications where stretchability combined with mechanical toughness and/or a high mechanical dissipation is required.

Title: Revisiting LaMnO3: A density functional theory study
Authors: Ju Hyeon Lee, Bongjae Kim
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has been widely applied to a variety of realistic materials but often struggles to explain the properties of correlated systems. The DFT + U method, which introduces a Hubbard U correction to the DFT, has been instrumental in providing the treatment of systems such as transition metal oxide. The methodological details of DFT + U and their specifics on the electronic structures and magnetic properties of the correlated systems remain incompletely understood. In this study, taking the prototypical transition metal oxide system, LaMnO3, as an example, we systematically assess the performance of the two distinct DFT + U methods, spin-polarized DFT (SDFT + U) and spin-un-polarized DFT (CDFT + U). We found that while Coulomb U acts similarly for the two approaches, Hund JH plays a fundamentally different role, particularly in the determination of the magnetic phases. Our investigation shows the active role of Hund JH on the exchange splitting, leading to distinct magnetic ground configurations in the two methods. We further investigate the associated magnetic exchange interactions and compare our results with so-called beyond-DFT methods.

Authors: Ivan N. Burenev, Daniël W. H. Cloete, Vansh Kharbanda, Hugo Touchette
Abstract: These notes are based on the lectures that one of us (HT) gave at the Summer School on the "Theory of Large Deviations and Applications", held in July 2024 at Les Houches in France. They present the basic definitions and mathematical results that form the theory of large deviations, as well as many simple motivating examples of applications in statistical physics, which serve as a basis for the many other lectures given at the school that covered more specific applications in biophysics, random matrix theory, nonequilibrium systems, geophysics, and the simulation of rare events, among other topics. These notes extend the lectures, which can be accessed online, by presenting exercises and pointer references for further reading.

Title: Impact of Nonlocal Coulomb Repulsion on Superconductivity and Density-Wave Orders in Bilayer Nickelates
Authors: Jun Zhan, Congcong Le, Xianxin Wu, Jiangping Hu
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and its thin films has generated significant interest in uncovering the underlying pairing mechanisms and correlated electronic states. While earlier theoretical studies have mainly focused on onsite Coulomb interactions, the role of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of nonlocal Coulomb interactions, in the presence of onsite interactions, on both superconducting and density-wave instabilities using the functional renormalization group (FRG) approach. We find that the interlayer intraorbital repulsion suppresses the interlayer intraorbital $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing and spin-density-wave (SDW) order, while promoting a transition to an interlayer interorbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state and a mirror-symmetry-breaking charge order. Remarkably, the critical scale of the interorbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is significantly lower than that of the intraorbital $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity, indicating that the former is unlikely to account for the observed high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Moreover, the interlayer interorbital repulsion suppresses this $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing but enhances the $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing through strengthened interlayer charge fluctuations. In addition, the intralayer nearest-neighbor repulsion favors an in-plane charge-density-wave (CDW) order with wave vector $(\pi,\pi)$. Our findings reveal the profound impact of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion and underscore the robustness of interlayer pairing rooted in the bilayer structure and multi-orbital nature, thereby advancing the understanding of the intricate correlation effects in bilayer nickelates.

Title: Measurement-induced phase transitions for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential
Authors: Toranosuke Matsubara, Kazuki Yamamoto, Akihisa Koga
Abstract: We study the dynamics under continuous measurements for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential by using the Aubry-André-Harper model with hopping rate $J$ and potential strength $V$. On the basis of the quantum trajectory method, we obtain the phase diagram for the steady-state entanglement entropy and demonstrate that robust logarithmic system-size scaling emerges up to a critical potential strength $V_c/J \sim 2.3$. Moreover, we find that the measurement induces entanglement phase transitions from the logarithmic-law phase to the area-law phase for the potential strength $V< V_c$, while any finite measurement stabilizes the area-law phase for $V>V_c$. This result is distinct from the entanglement scaling in the unitary limit, where volume-law and area-law phases undergo a transition at $V/J=2$. To further support the phase diagram, we analyze the connected correlation function and find that it shows algebraic decay in the logarithmic-law phase, while it decays quickly in the area-law phase. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by introducing quasiperiodic potentials and continuously monitoring the local occupation number with an off-resonant probe light.

Title: Evaluation of Circular Complex Permeability in Single-Crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet at Cryogenic Temperatures
Authors: Junta Igarashi, Shota Norimoto, Hiroyuki Kayano, Noriyoshi Hashimoto, Makoto Minohara, Nobu-Hisa Kaneko, Tomonori Arakawa
Abstract: The operation of superconducting qubits requires a sensitive readout circuit at cryogenic temperatures, driving the demand for cryogenic non reciprocal microwave components such as circulators. However, evaluating these components at low temperatures presents significant challenges for companies and institutions without specialized measurement systems. In the development of such cryogenic non reciprocal components, the temperature dependence of ferrite's magnetic properties is the most critical factor. Therefore, an evaluation technique for accurately assessing these properties at cryogenic temperatures is essential. In this study, we develop a measurement method to characterize low loss ferrite materials over a temperature range of 300 K to 2 K. The use of the circularly polarized resonance mode \( \text{TE}_{11n} \) enables the direct estimation of circular complex permeability and the determination of key material parameters, including saturation magnetization and damping constant both essential for assessing the performance of ferrite materials in circulator applications. To validate the reliability of our measurement method, we selected single crystal YIG as the test material, as its magnetic properties at cryogenic temperatures are relatively well known. This demonstration confirms that our method is effective for characterizing various low loss ferrite materials that are potential candidates for compact cryogenic non reciprocal devices.

Title: Exchange interactions in itinerant magnets: the effects of local particle-hole irreducible vertex corrections and SU(2) symmetry of Hund interaction
Authors: A. A. Katanin
Abstract: We study exchange interactions in iron and nickel within the DFT+DMFT approach with density-density and SU(2) symmetric Coulomb interaction. In particular, we analyze the representation of exchange interactions through the electron non-local Green's functions, connecting the local particle-hole (ph) irreducible interaction vertices. While the neglect of the local ph-irreducible vertex corrections, suggested previously within the dual fermion approach [E. A. Stepanov, this http URL., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 121}, 037204 (2018)], yields the result corresponding to the generalization of the magnetic force theorem approach, we argue that these vertex corrections are in fact less important for strong localized magnets, such as iron, but become more essential for weak itinerant magnets, such as nickel. At the same time, the overall account of the local vertex and self-energy corrections in the so-called renormalized magnetic force theorem approach is essential for iron, and less important for nickel. The difference of the results of density-density and SU(2) symmetric Coulomb interaction is found to be relatively small, in contrast to the Curie temperature and the value of the local magnetic moment.

Title: Non-Hermitian Hopf insulators
Authors: Daichi Nakamura, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: Hopf insulators represent a unique class of topological insulators that exist exclusively in two-band systems and are inherently unstable upon the inclusion of additional bands. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that non-Hermiticity gives rise to distinctive complex-energy gap structures, known as point gaps, and associated topological phases with no analogs in Hermitian systems. However, non-Hermitian counterparts of Hopf insulators have remained largely elusive. Here, we generally classify topological phases of two-band non-Hermitian systems based on the homotopy theory and uncover Hopf-type point-gap topology present only for two bands. Specifically, we reveal such Hopf-type point-gap topology for three-dimensional systems with chiral symmetry (class AIII) and four-dimensional systems with no symmetry (class A). Explicitly constructing prototypical models from the Hermitian Hopf insulator, we further demonstrate that these non-Hermitian topological phases lead to anomalous point-gapless boundary states spectrally detachable from the bulk bands.

Title: Role of On-site and Inter-site Coulomb Interactions in KV$_3$Sb$_5$: A first-principles DFT+$U$+$V$ study
Authors: Indukuru Ramesh Reddy, Sayandeep Ghosh, Bongjae Kim, Chang-Jong Kang
Abstract: Nonlocal Coulomb interactions play a crucial role in stabilizing distinct electronic phases in kagome materials. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of on-site ($U$) and inter-site ($V$) Coulomb interactions on the electronic structure and stability of charge-density-wave (CDW) phases in the kagome metal KV$_3$Sb$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT+$U$+$V$) calculations. We demonstrate that $V$ promotes the formation and stability of CDW phases, whereas $U$ suppresses these phases, highlighting a fundamental competition between local and nonlocal Coulomb interactions. By directly comparing our theoretical results with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data, we identify realistic values of $U$ and $V$ that accurately describe the electronic band structure of KV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our findings establish a detailed $U$-$V$ phase diagram for KV$_3$Sb$_5$, offering valuable insights into the correlated electronic states in kagome metals and serving as a foundation for future explorations of correlation-driven phenomena in related materials.

Title: Unveiling the thermal transport properties of Biphenylene nanotubes: A molecular dynamics study
Authors: Jhionathan de Lima, Cristiano F. Woellner
Abstract: Biphenylene nanotubes (BPNNTs) represent a novel class of carbon-based nanomaterials, constructed by rolling a biphenylene network (BPN) monolayer into a one-dimensional tubular structure. In this study, the thermal transport properties of BPNNTs are investigated using reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. At room temperature, the lattice thermal conductivity of armchair and zigzag BPNNTs is found to be approximately 100 W/m.K and 90 W/m.K, respectively. These values are at least one order of magnitude lower than those reported for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). This significant reduction is attributed to the unique atomic arrangement of BPNNTs, which leads to a substantially lower phonon group velocity. Furthermore, the effects of nanotube length, diameter, and temperature on thermal transport are systematically analyzed. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the geometry- and temperature-dependent thermal behavior, a comprehensive analysis of phonon dispersion relations, vibrational density of states, and phonon group velocities is conducted. This study offers valuable insight into the thermal transport properties of BPNNTs, with implications for thermal management and energy-related applications.

Title: Ab initio study of strain-driven vacancy clustering in aluminum
Authors: Sayan Bhowmik, Abhiraj Sharma, Andrew J. Medford, John E. Pask, Phanish Suryanarayana
Abstract: We present a first principles investigation of strain-driven vacancy clustering in aluminum. Specifically, we perform Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations to study the influence of hydrostatic strains on clustering in tri-, quad-, and heptavacancies. We find that compressive strains are a key driving force for vacancy aggregation, particularly for collapse of clusters on the (111) plane, consistent with prior experimental observations of vacancy clusters on this plane. Notably, we find that the heptavacancy on the (111) plane collapses to form a prismatic dislocation loop for hydrostatic compressive strains exceeding 5\%, highlighting the critical role of such strains in prismatic dislocation loop nucleation in aluminum.

Title: Theory of spin Seebeck effect activated by acoustic chiral phonons
Authors: Naoki Nishimura, Takumi Funato, Mamoru Matsuo, Takeo Kato
Abstract: We theoretically explore the generation of spin current driven by a temperature gradient in a junction between a chiral insulator and a normal metal. Based on the gyromagnetic response induced by microscopic acoustic-phonon-mediated lattice rotation, we derive a formula for the spin current when a finite temperature difference is imposed between two ends of the sample. We clarify how the phonon-mediated spin current depends on the sample geometry, the thermal conductivity, the heat conductance at the interface, and the average temperature. Our formulation provides a microscopic foundation for the chiral-phonon-activated spin Seebeck effect without relying on magnetism or spin-orbit interactions.

Title: Cross-Modal Characterization of Thin Film MoS$_2$ Using Generative Models
Authors: Isaiah A. Moses, Chen Chen, Joan M. Redwing, Wesley F. Reinhart
Abstract: The growth and characterization of materials using empirical optimization typically requires a significant amount of expert time, experience, and resources. Several complementary characterization methods are routinely performed to determine the quality and properties of a grown sample. Machine learning (ML) can support the conventional approaches by using historical data to guide and provide speed and efficiency to the growth and characterization of materials. Specifically, ML can provide quantitative information from characterization data that is typically obtained from a different modality. In this study, we have investigated the feasibility of projecting the quantitative metric from microscopy measurements, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), using data obtained from spectroscopy measurements, like Raman spectroscopy. Generative models were also trained to generate the full and specific features of the Raman and photoluminescence spectra from each other and the AFM images of the thin film MoS$_2$. The results are promising and have provided a foundational guide for the use of ML for the cross-modal characterization of materials for their accelerated, efficient, and cost-effective discovery.

Title: Coherent phonon motions and ordered vacancy compound mediated quantum path interference in Cu-poor CuIn$_{x}$Ga$_{(1-x)}$Se$_2$ (CIGS) with attosecond transient absorption
Authors: Hugo Laurell, Jonah R. Adelman, Elizaveta Yakovleva, Carl Hägglund, Kostiantyn Sopiha, Axel Stenquist, Han K. D. Le, Peidong Yang, Marika Edoff, Stephen R. Leone
Abstract: In this study, coherent phonon motion is observed in bandgap excited CuIn$_{x}$Ga$_{(1-x)}$Se$_2$ (CIGS) utilizing extreme ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy across the Se M$_{4,5}$ absorption edge. Two frequencies of coherent phonon motion are resolved, a low frequency mode attributed through Raman measurements to the $A_{1g}$ phonon motion of a Cu-deficient ordered vacancy compound (OVC), while the high frequency mode originates from the $A_{1g}$ phonon motion in the chalcopyrite phase. The two oscillations lead to modulations in the XUV differential absorption $\Delta A(\epsilon,\tau)$ due to energy shifts of the Se M$_{4,5}$ edge, with a minima occuring approximately 1 ps after the band gap excitation. The hot carrier cooling time of holes and electrons are disentangled and the observed slower cooling of holes is attributed to the higher density of hole states in the valence band. We also observe fast oscillations (18.6(3) fs period) across the Se absorption edge, which are interpreted to originate from quantum path interference between the electronic conduction bands of the chalcopyrite CIGS and OVC phases, opening the possibility towards quantum coherent metrology in photovoltaics on the femtosecond timescale. The complex interplay between the chalcopyrite and OVC phases are revealed in this investigation through both coherent vibrational and electronic motions.

Title: Observation of terahertz spin-Hall magnetoresistance in the model system $Y_3Fe_5O_{12}|Pt$

Abstract: We report the observation of spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in prototypical bilayers of ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and platinum in the frequency range from 0 THz to as high as 1.5 THz. The effect exhibits a strong low-pass behavior: It decreases by approximately 75% from 0 THz to 0.2 THz and vanishes at 1.5 THz. Based on a dynamic model of SMR, we can consistently explain the measured frequency dependence by a competition of the transverse coherent and longitudinal incoherent spin-torque contributions to the spin current. Our analysis suggests that the nonzero response time of the magnon chemical potential is responsible for the increased out-flow of incoherent magnons through the YIG|Pt interface at high frequencies and, consequently, for the dramatic spectral decay of the SMR. These results establish THz SMR as a powerful probe of ultrafast interfacial spinmagnon coupling.

Title: A minimal model with stochastically broken reciprocity
Authors: Z. C. Tu
Abstract: We introduce a minimal model consisting of a two-body system with stochastically broken reciprocity (i.e., random violation of Newton's third law) and then investigate its statistical behaviors, including fluctuations of velocity and position, time evolution of probability distribution functions, energy gain, and entropy production. The effective temperature of this two-body system immersed in a thermal bath is also derived. Furthermore, we heuristically present an extremely minimal model where the relative motion adheres to the same rules as in classical mechanics, while the effect of stochastically broken reciprocity only manifests in the fluctuating motion of the center of mass.

Title: Light-induced ultrafast magnetization dynamics in van der Waals antiferromagnetic CrSBr
Authors: Ali Kefayati, Yafei Ren
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of semiconducting antiferromagnetic CrSBr using real-time time-dependent density functional theory. In zero magnetic field, laser excitation modifies only the magnetization along the easy axis, leaving transverse components unaffected. We find that below-gap, low-fluence pulses enhance the local magnetic moments via spin transfer from nonmagnetic to magnetic atoms, increasing the Neel vector. In contrast, high-fluence pulses drive interlayer spin transfer between magnetic atoms, producing strong demagnetization and reducing the Neel vector, while S and Br atoms exhibit primarily charge transfer with weak opposite contribution to the demagnetization. An applied magnetic field qualitatively alters the response, enabling both magnitude changes and ultrafast reorientation of the magnetization. We show that the resulting layer-resolved reorientation respects a twofold rotation about the x-axis, exciting coherent optical magnons even under this symmetry, which modulate the relative angle between neighboring layers and periodically tune electronic properties. These results reveal a microscopic pathway for coherent magnon excitation in van der Waals magnets and establish a framework for controlling their coupled spin-charge dynamics on femtosecond timescales.

Title: Chern-Simons-matter conformal field theory on fuzzy sphere: Confinement transition of Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid
Authors: Zheng Zhou, Chong Wang, Yin-Chen He
Abstract: Gauge theories compose a large class of interacting conformal field theories in 3d, among which an outstanding category is critical Chern-Simons-matter theories. In this paper, we focus on one of the simplest instances: one complex critical scalar coupled to $\mathrm{U}(1)_2$ Chern-Simons gauge field. It is theoretically interesting as it is conjectured to exhibit dualities between four simple Lagrangian descriptions, but also practically important as it describes the transition between Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (or $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state) and trivially gapped phase. Using the fuzzy sphere regularisation, we realise this theory as a transition on the spherical lowest Landau level between a $\nu_f=2$ fermionic integer quantum Hall state and a $\nu_b=1/2$ bosonic fractional quantum Hall state. We show that this transition is continuous and has emergent conformal symmetry. By studying the operator spectrum, we show that there exists only one relevant singlet with scaling dimension $\Delta_S=1.52(18)$. We also discuss other higher operators and the consequences of our results.

Title: Universal relations between thermoelectrics and noise in mesoscopic transport across a tunnel junction
Authors: Andrei I. Pavlov, Mikhail N. Kiselev
Abstract: We develop a unified theory of weakly probed differential observables for currents and noise in transport experiments. Our findings uncover a set of universal transport relations between thermoelectric and noise properties of a system probed through a tunnel contact, with the Wiedemann-Franz law being just one example of such universality between charge and heat currents. We apply this theory to various quantum dot systems, including multichannel Kondo, quantum Hall and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev quantum dots, and demonstrate that each of the microscopic theories is characterized by a set of universal relations connecting conductance and thermoelectrics with noise. Violations of these relations indicate additional energy scales emerging in a system.

Title: Observing Differential Spin Currents by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering

Abstract: Controlling spin currents, i.e., the flow of spin angular momentum, in small magnetic devices is the principal objective of spin electronics, a main contender for future energy efficient information technologies. Surprisingly, a pure spin current has never been measured directly since the associated electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection methods optimized for charge transport. Here we report that resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current carried by magnons -- the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic order -- in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator. This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics.

Title: Design Rules and Discovery of Face-Sharing Hexagonal Perovskites
Authors: M. J. Swamynadhan, Gwan Yeong Jung, Pravan Omprakash, Rohan Mishra
Abstract: Hexagonal perovskites with face-sharing octahedral connectivity are an underexplored class of materials. We propose quantitative design principles for stabilizing face-sharing ABX3 hexagonal perovskites based on a comparative analysis of oxides and sulfides. By mapping structural preferences across a phase-space defined by an electronegativity-corrected tolerance factor and the Shannon radius of the A-site cations, we identify distinct thresholds that separate hexagonal phases from competing cubic polymorphs having corner-sharing octahedral connectivity. Our analysis reveals that sulfides differ significantly from oxides due to the increased covalency of the transition metal-sulfur bonds, which enables broader compositional flexibility. Applying these principles, we predict a set of thermodynamically formable ABO3 and ABS3 compounds that are likely to adopt face-sharing octahedral connectivity. These findings establish a predictive framework for designing hexagonal perovskites, highlighting sulfides as promising candidates for obtaining quasi-one-dimensional materials having transition-metal cations for novel ferroic phenomena.

Title: Edgetronics in 2D Altermagnet via Real-Space-Spin Coupling
Authors: Shibo Fang, Zongmeng Yang, Jianhua Wang, Xingyue Yang, Jing Lu, Xiaotian Wang, Yee Sin Ang
Abstract: The coupling between real-space coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states - energetically isolated within the bulk band gap - emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr2Se2O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the Neel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.

Title: Colloidal hydrodynamic interactions in viscoelastic fluids
Authors: Dae Yeon Kim, Sachit G. Nagella, Saksham Malik, Nayeon Park, Jaewook Nam, Eric S.G. Shaqfeh, Sho C. Takatori
Abstract: The motion of suspended colloidal particles generates fluid disturbances in the surrounding medium that create interparticle interactions. While such colloidal hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) have been extensively studied in viscous Newtonian media, comprehensive understanding of HIs in viscoelastic fluids is lacking. We develop a framework to quantify HIs in viscoelastic fluids with high spatiotemporal precision by trapping colloids and inducing translation-rotation hydrodynamic coupling. Using solutions of wormlike micelles (WLMs) as a case study, we discover that HIs are strongly time-dependent and depend on the structural memory generated in the viscoelastic fluid, in contrast to "instantaneous" HIs in viscous Newtonian fluids. We directly measure time-dependent HIs between a stationary probe and a driven particle during transient start-up, developing on the WLM relaxation timescale. Following the sudden cessation of the driven particle, we observe an intriguing flow reversal in the opposing direction, lasting for a time about ten times larger than the WLM relaxation time. We corroborate our observations with analytical microhydrodynamic theory, direct numerical solutions of a continuum model, and particle-based Stokesian dynamics simulations. We find that the structural recovery of the WLMs from a nonlinear strain can generate anisotropic and heterogeneous stresses that produce flow reversals and hydrodynamic attraction among colloids. Measured heterogeneities indicate a breakdown of standard continuum models for constitutive relations when the size of colloids is comparable to the length scales of the polymeric constituents and their entanglement lengths.

Title: Generalized invariants meet constitutive neural networks: A novel framework for hyperelastic materials
Authors: Denisa Martonová, Alain Goriely, Ellen Kuhl
Abstract: The major challenge in determining a hyperelastic model for a given material is the choice of invariants and the selection how the strain energy function depends functionally on these invariants. Here we introduce a new data-driven framework that simultaneously discovers appropriate invariants and constitutive models for isotropic incompressible hyperelastic materials. Our approach identifies both the most suitable invariants in a class of generalized invariants and the corresponding strain energy function directly from experimental observations. Unlike previous methods that rely on fixed invariant choices or sequential fitting procedures, our method integrates the discovery process into a single neural network architecture. By looking at a continuous family of possible invariants, the model can flexibly adapt to different material behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using popular benchmark datasets for rubber and brain tissue. For rubber, the method recovers a stretch-dominated formulation consistent with classical models. For brain tissue, it identifies a formulation sensitive to small stretches, capturing the nonlinear shear response characteristic of soft biological matter. Compared to traditional and neural-network-based models, our framework provides improved predictive accuracy and interpretability across a wide range of deformation states. This unified strategy offers a robust tool for automated and physically meaningful model discovery in hyperelasticity.

Title: Dynamic-Kinetic Duality of Particulate and Multiphase Systems
Authors: Carlos E. Colosqui
Abstract: The evolution of particulate and multiphase systems can transition from dynamic regimes, governed by classical transport equations with well-defined damping coefficients, to anomalously slow relaxation described by rate equations when the system is critically close to equilibrium. This regime crossover has been both theoretically predicted and experimentally observed in diverse multiphase systems relevant to numerous technological applications, including nanoparticle adhesion at interfaces and liquid imbibition under microscale confinement, and it is attributed to the presence of small nanoscale features of physical or chemical nature at liquid-solid interfaces. This article presents a theoretical framework to more accurately predict and control, advancing or delaying, the dynamic-to-kinetic regime crossover, and highlights strategies for harnessing this phenomenon to enhance or suppress different transport processes in confined multiphase systems.

Title: Structural contribution to light-induced gap suppression in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$
Authors: Zijing Chen, Chenhang Xu, Chendi Xie, Weichen Tang, Qiaomei Liu, Dong Wu, Qing Xu, Tao Jiang, Pengfei Zhu, Xiao Zou, Jun Li, Zhiwei Wang, Nanlin Wang, Dong Qian, Alfred Zong, Dao Xiang
Abstract: An excitonic insulator is a material that hosts an exotic ground state, where an energy gap opens due to spontaneous condensation of bound electron-hole pairs. Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is a promising candidate for this type of material, but the coexistence of a structural phase transition with the gap opening has led to a long-standing debate regarding the origin of the insulating gap. Here we employ MeV ultrafast electron diffraction to obtain quantitative insights into the atomic displacements in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ following photoexcitation, which has been overlooked in previous time-resolved spectroscopy studies. In conjunction with first-principles calculations using the measured atomic displacements, we find that the structural change can largely account for the photoinduced reduction in the energy gap without considering excitonic effects. Our work illustrates the importance of a quantitative reconstruction of individual atomic pathways during nonequilibrium phase transitions, paving the way for a mechanistic understanding of a diverse array of phase transitions in correlated materials where lattice dynamics can play a pivotal role.

Title: Bulk photovoltaic effects in the Haldane model
Authors: Bo-Xin Lin, Hsiu-Chuan Hsu
Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) refers to the direct current generation in a noncentrosymmetric material under illumination and can be applied to solar energy technology. BPVE includes injection and shift currents, led by the change of velocity and displacement of wave packet during optical transitions, respectively. We derive the constraints on the conductivity tensors imposed by mirror-time ($\mathcal{MT}$) symmetry for two-dimensional systems. For the Haldane model, we show that linearly polarized light can induce shift and injection currents, which vanish under circularly polarized light as constrained by the three-fold rotation and $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry. Additionally, due to the presence of $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry, a separation of responses is observed in the Haldane model: one direction exhibits a time-reversal symmetry-allowed response, whereas another manifests a parity-time symmetry-allowed response. Across the topological phase transition, the injection current does not change sign, whereas shift current shows a sign flip. The vector field of the Hermitian connection in the Brillouin zone possesses vortices in the topological phase, but not in the trivial phase. Furthermore, we calculate the related quantum geometry, including Berry curvature, quantum metric and Hermitian connection, and demonstrate the microscopic quantum origin of the BPVE.

Title: A Robust Large-Period Discrete Time Crystal and its Signature in a Digital Quantum Computer
Authors: Tianqi Chen, Ruizhe Shen, Ching Hua Lee, Bo Yang, Raditya Weda Bomantara
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states of matter which break time translational symmetry. DTCs have been extensively realized in experiments, particularly their subclass that is characterized by period-doubling dynamics due to its natural occurrence in a system of periodically driven two-level, e.g., spin-1/2, particles. The realization of DTCs beyond period-doubling, including their generalizations termed discrete quasicrystals has also been made in recent years, though such experiments typically involve higher spin particles. Constructing and observing DTCs beyond period-doubling in systems of two-level particles are generally still considered an open challenge due to the latter's $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that natively only leads to period-doubling. In this work, we developed an intuitive interacting system of two-level particles (qubits) that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs). Remarkably, by utilizing a variational algorithm, we are able to observe clear signatures of such $4T$-DTCs in a quantum processor despite the presence of considerable noise and the small number of available qubits. Our findings extend the landscape of time crystalline behavior by demonstrating a distinct realization of time crystallinity beyond standard period-doubling dynamics with qubits (two-level particles) on a NISQ-era digital quantum computer, as well as the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.

Title: Simultaneous symmetry breaking in spontaneous Floquet states: temporal Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone modes, Floquet thermodynamics, and the time operator
Authors: Juan Ramón Muñoz de Nova, Fernando Sols
Abstract: We study simultaneous symmetry breaking in spontaneous Floquet states, focusing on the specific case of an atomic condensate. We first describe the quantization of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes for a stationary state simultaneously breaking several symmetries of the Hamiltonian by invoking the generalized Gibbs ensemble, which enables a thermodynamical description of the problem. The quantization procedure involves a Berry-Gibbs connection, which depends on the macroscopic conserved charges associated to each broken symmetry and whose curvature is not invariant under generalized gauge transformations. We extend the formalism to Floquet states, where Goldstone theorem translates into the emergence of Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone (FNG) modes with zero quasi-energy. In the case of a spontaneous Floquet state, there is a genuine temporal FNG mode arising from the continuous time-translation symmetry breaking, whose quantum amplitude provides a rare realization of a time operator in Quantum Mechanics. Furthermore, since they conserve energy, spontaneous Floquet states can be shown to possess a conserved Floquet charge. Conventional Floquet systems also admit a thermodynamic description in terms of the Floquet enthalpy, the Legendre transform of the energy with respect to the Floquet charge, as these operate at fixed frequency. We apply our formalism to a particular realization of spontaneous Floquet state, the CES state, which breaks $U(1)$ and time-translation symmetries, representing a time supersolid. We numerically compute its density-density correlations, predicted to be dominated by the temporal FNG mode at long times, observing a remarkable agreement between simulation and theory. Based on these results, we propose a feasible experimental scheme to observe the temporal FNG mode of the CES state.

Title: Non-Markovian Quantum Heat Statistics with the Reaction Coordinate Mapping

Abstract: The definition of heat in quantum mechanics is ambiguous. Complications arise in particular when the coupling between a quantum system and a thermal environment is non-negligible, as the boundary between the two becomes blurred, making the distinction between system and environment difficult to draw. The reaction coordinate mapping can be used in such regimes to redraw the boundary between the system and environment. In this paper we combine the reaction coordinate technique with a two-point measurement protocol to compare two different definitions of heat: energetic changes with respect to the full environment Hamiltonian (prior to the mapping), and energetic changes with respect to the residual environment Hamiltonian (after the mapping). We find that the latter definition displays behaviour more expected of a heat bath in the highly non-Markovian regime considered.

Title: Quantum Thermal Analogs of Electric Circuits: A Universal Approach
Authors: Devvrat Tiwari, Samyadeb Bhattacharya, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: In this work, we develop a panoramic schematic of quantum thermal analogs of electric circuits in the steady state regime. We establish the foundations of said premise by defining the analogs of Kirchhoff's laws for heat currents and temperature gradients, as well as a quantum thermal step transformer. Using this, we develop two novel quantum thermal circuits, viz., quantum thermal super Wheatstone bridge and quantum thermal adder circuit, paving the way for the corresponding integrated circuits. We further show that our approach encompasses various circuits like thermal diode, transistor, and Wheatstone bridge. This sheds new light on the present architecture of quantum device engineering.

Title: Modern Approach to 2D Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Yuya Kusuki
Abstract: The primary aim of these lecture notes is to introduce the modern approach to two-dimensional conformal field theory (2D CFT). The study of analytical methods in two-dimensional conformal field theory has developed over several decades, starting with BPZ. The development of analytical methods, particularly in rational conformal field theory (RCFT), has been remarkable, with complete classifications achieved for certain model groups. One motivation for studying CFT comes from its ability to describe quantum critical systems. Given that realistic quantum critical systems are fundamentally RCFTs, it is somewhat natural that the analytical methods of RCFT have evolved significantly. CFTs other than RCFTs are called irrational conformal field theories (ICFTs). Compared to RCFTs, the study of ICFTs has not progressed as much. Leaving aside whether there is physical motivation or not, ICFTs inherently possess a difficulty that makes them challenging to approach. However, with the development of quantum gravity, the advancement of analytical methods for ICFTs has become essential. The reason lies in the AdS/CFT correspondence. AdS/CFT refers to the relationship between $d+1$ dimensional quantum gravity and $d$ dimensional CFT. Within this correspondence, the CFT appears as a non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity. Except in special cases, this CFT belongs to ICFT. Against this backdrop, the methods for ICFTs have developed rapidly in recent years. Many of these ICFT methods are indispensable for modern quantum gravity research. Unfortunately, these cannot be learned from textbooks on 2D CFTs, such as Yellow book. These lecture notes aim to fill this gap. Specifically, we will cover techniques that have already been applied in many studies, such as HHLL block and monodromy method, and significant results that have become proper nouns, such as Hellerman bound and HKS bound.

Title: Orthogonal projections of hypercubes
Authors: Yoshiaki Horiike, Shin Fujishiro
Abstract: Projections of hypercubes have been applied to visualize high-dimensional binary state spaces in various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate us to explore theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA-projected hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the hypercubic state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, which characterize the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems, specifically finite artificial spin-ice systems, including those with geometric frustration. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. We confirm that the time-integrated probability flux exhibits patterns consistent with the pathways identified in the projected hypercubic energy landscapes. Using the mean-field model, we show that dominant state transition pathways tend to emerge around the periphery of the projected hypercubes. Our work provides a better understanding of how PCA discovers hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.

Title: Efficient Construction of Feasible Solutions in Column Generation using Quantum Annealing
Authors: Taisei Takabayashi, Naoki Maruyama, Takuma Yoshihara, Renichiro Haba, Masayuki Ohzeki
Abstract: Column generation (CG) has been used to solve constrained 0-1 quadratic programming problems. The pricing problem, which is iteratively solved in CG, can be reduced to an unconstrained 0-1 quadratic programming problem, allowing for the efficient application of quantum annealing (QA). The solutions obtained by CG are continuous relaxations, which cannot be practically used as feasible 0-1 solutions. In this paper, we propose a postprocessing method for constructing feasible 0-1 solutions from the continuous relaxations obtained through CG. The proposed technique consists of two phases: (i) mapping the continuous CG solution to a feasible 0-1 solution and (ii) applying a constraint-aware local search to improve that solution's quality. Numerical experiments on randomly generated problems demonstrate that CG with the proposed postprocessing yields solutions comparable to commercial solvers with significantly reduced computation time. Consequently, the postprocessing enables CG with QA to obtain high-quality approximate solutions faster.

Title: Dynamical quantum phase transition, metastable state, and dimensionality reduction: Krylov analysis of fully connected spin models
Authors: Kazutaka Takahashi
Abstract: We study quenched dynamics of fully-connected spin models. The system is prepared in a ground state of the initial Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian is suddenly changed to a different form. We apply the Krylov subspace method to map the system onto an effective tridiagonal Hamiltonian. The state is confined in a potential well and is time-evolved by nonuniform hoppings. The dynamical singularities for the survival probability can occur when the state is reflected from a potential barrier. Although we do not observe any singularity in the spread complexity, we find that the entropy exhibits small dips at the singular times. We find that the presence of metastable state affects long-time behavior of the spread complexity, and physical observables. We also observe a reduction of the state-space dimension when the Hamiltonian reduces to a classical form.

Title: Deterministic Mechanical Wigner Negativity via Nonlinear Cavity Quantum Optomechanics in the Unresolved-Sideband Regime
Authors: Jack Clarke, Pascal Neveu, Ewold Verhagen, Michael R. Vanner
Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states of mechanical motion exhibiting Wigner negativity offer promising capabilities for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Within the field of cavity quantum optomechanics, deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states with such Wigner negativity is a highly sought goal but is challenging as the intracavity interaction Hamiltonian is linear in mechanical position. Here, we show that, despite this form of interaction, by utilizing the nonlinearity of the cavity response with mechanical position, mechanical Wigner negativity can be prepared deterministically in the unresolved-sideband regime, without additional nonlinearities, nonclassical drives, or conditional measurements. In particular, we find that Wigner negativity can be prepared with an optical pulse, even without single-photon strong coupling, and the negativity persists in the steady state of a continuously driven system. Our results deepen our understanding of cavity-enhanced radiation pressure and establish a pathway for deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states in the unresolved sideband regime.

Title: Correlation Functions and Chaotic Behavior of the SYK Chain Model in Pure States
Authors: Seyyed M.H. Halataei
Abstract: Recent investigations of Rényi entanglement entropy in the SYK chain of Majorana fermions have indicated that the model exhibits slow thermalization when initialized in certain states. The extent to which the heavy modes -- believed to underlie this behavior -- affect other aspects of the model remains an open question. In this work, I study thermalization and scrambling of information in individual energy eigenstates of the SYK chain using exact diagonalization. I show that two-point correlation functions in finite-energy eigenstates closely match their thermal counterparts and that information scrambling occurs efficiently within these pure states. These results suggest that the slow thermalization observed in entanglement dynamics does not extend to all probes of thermalization and scrambling, even in pure states. I discuss the implications of these findings for thermal states in a potential holographic dual theory.

Title: Observation of Purcell Effect in Electrically Coupled Cavity-Magnet System
Authors: Italo L. Soares Andrade, Kleber Pirota, Amir O. Caldeira, Francisco Rouxinol
Abstract: We report the observation of the Purcell effect in a cavity-metallic magnet hybrid system using electric-field-mediated coupling. In this configuration, microwave-induced axial currents in the microwire induce circular magnetic fields that drive the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of the magnetized microwire. Field-dependent transmission and reflection spectroscopies reveal a clear cavity perturbation consistent with the Purcell regime, in which the magnetic loss rate exceeds the light-matter coupling strength. Despite the small magnetic volume ($\sim 10^{-13}\,\text{m}^3$), measurements performed at both room temperature and $T = 7$ mK show coupling rates as high as $g/2pi = 56$ MHz, one order of magnitude stronger than the one expected from conventional coupling at the magnetic antinode. Time-domain ringdown measurements directly show the magnetic-field-dependent modification of the cavity photon lifetime, in agreement with theoretical predictions. These results establish a versatile approach for coupling microwave fields to metallic magnets via geometric and electric-field-mediated interactions, opening new opportunities for hybrid cavity-magnet systems.

Title: Information Transport in Classical-Quantum Hybrid System
Authors: Julian Rapp, Radhika H. Joshi, Alwin van Steensel, Yuli V. Nazarov, Mohammad H. Ansari
Abstract: Many important quantities in quantum information science, such as entropy and entanglement, are non-linear functions of the density matrix and cannot be expressed as operator observables. Standard open-system approaches evolve only a single copy of the density matrix, making it impossible to track the dynamics of such quantities. A formalism proposed by some of the present authors addressed this challenge by evolving multiple virtual replicas, but was limited to the weak-coupling regime. Here, we extend this approach to strong coupling between a quantum system and classical environments. The resulting multi-replica master equation enables direct evaluation of entropy flow and related metrics in strongly hybridized quantum-classical systems. Our results show that quantum coherence and hybridization jointly suppress net entropy transfer, creating a thermodynamic bottleneck. This framework provides a general tool for studying entropy dynamics and guiding the design of more robust, resource-efficient quantum hardware.

Title: Extending fusion rules with finite subgroups: For a general understanding of quotient or gauging
Authors: Yoshiki Fukusumi, Shinichiro Yahagi
Abstract: We introduce a general method for realizing simple current extensions of the conformal field theories. We systematically obtain the $Z_{N}$ symmetry extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\subset Z_{N})$. The bulk (or nonchiral) fusion ring provides fundamental algebraic data for conformal bootstrap, and the chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the graded symmetry topological field theories. The latter also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick to the resultant coupled theories, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures. This work opens new research directions in studying the classification of conformal field theories and the corresponding topological quantum field theories (or topological orders) by establishing the traditional methods in abstract algebra and modular form.
