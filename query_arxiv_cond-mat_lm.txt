Title: Doping lattice non-abelian quantum Hall states
Authors: Zhengyan Darius Shi, Carolyn Zhang, T. Senthil
Abstract: We study quantum phases of a fluid of mobile charged non-abelian anyons, which arise upon doping the lattice Moore-Read quantum Hall state at lattice filling $\nu = 1/2$ and its generalizations to the Read-Rezayi ($\mathrm{RR}_k$) sequence at $\nu = k/(k+2)$. In contrast to their abelian counterparts, non-abelian anyons present unique challenges due to their non-invertible fusion rules and non-abelian braiding structures. We address these challenges using a Chern-Simons-Ginzburg-Landau (CSGL) framework that incorporates the crucial effect of energy splitting between different anyon fusion channels at nonzero dopant density. For the Moore-Read state, we show that doping the charge $e/4$ non-abelion naturally leads to a fully gapped charge-$2$ superconductor without any coexisting topological order. The chiral central charge of the superconductor depends on details of the interactions determining the splitting of anyon fusion channels. For general $\mathrm{RR}_k$ states, our analysis of states obtained by doping the basic non-abelion $a_0$ with charge $e/(k+2)$ reveals a striking even/odd pattern in the Read-Rezayi index $k$. We develop a general physical picture for anyon-driven superconductivity based on charge-flux unbinding, and show how it relates to the CSGL description of doped abelian quantum Hall states. Finally, as a bonus, we use the CSGL formalism to describe transitions between the $\mathrm{RR}_k$ state and a trivial period-$(k+2)$ CDW insulator at fixed filling, driven by the gap closure of the fundamental non-abelian anyon $a_0$. Notably, for $k=2$, this predicts a period-4 CDW neighboring the Moore-Read state at half-filling, offering a potential explanation of recent numerical observations in models of twisted MoTe$_2$.

Title: Upper bound on $T_c$ in a strongly coupled electron-boson superconductor
Authors: Nikolay V. Gnezdilov, Rufus Boyack
Abstract: Migdal-Eliashberg theory (METh) of boson-mediated superconductivity contains a $\sqrt{\lambda}$ divergence in the critical temperature $T_c$ at strong electron-boson coupling $\lambda$. In conventional METh, the strong-coupling regime can be accessed only in the limit that $\lambda_E = \lambda \, \omega_D/\varepsilon_F\ll1$, where $\omega_D$ is the Debye frequency and $\varepsilon_F$ is the Fermi energy. Here we go beyond this restriction in the context of the two-dimensional Yukawa-SYK (Y-SYK) model, which is solvable for arbitrary values of $\lambda_E$. We find that $T_c\approx 0.18 \,\omega_D \sqrt{\lambda}$ for large $\lambda$, provided $\lambda_E$ remains small, and crosses over to a universal value of $T_c \approx 0.04\, \varepsilon_F$ for large $\lambda_E$. The saturation of $T_c$ is due to a self-consistent account of the boson dynamics for large $\lambda_E$ and is arguably qualitatively valid beyond the Y-SYK framework. These results demonstrate how the $\sqrt{\lambda}$ growth of $T_c$ in METh saturates to a universal value independent of $\lambda$ and $\omega_D$, providing an upper bound on the critical temperature at strong electron-boson coupling.

Title: XDiag: Exact Diagonalization for quantum many-body systems
Authors: Alexander Wietek, Luke Staszewski, Martin Ulaga, Paul L. Ebert, Hannes Karlsson, Siddhartha Sarkar, Henry Shackleton, Aritra Sinha, Rafael D. Soares
Abstract: Exact diagonalization (ED) is a cornerstone technique in quantum many-body physics, enabling precise solutions to the Schrödinger equation for interacting quantum systems. Despite its utility in studying ground states, excited states, and dynamical behaviors, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size presents significant computational challenges. We introduce XDiag, an open-source software package designed to combine advanced and efficient algorithms for ED with and without symmetry-adapted bases with user-friendly interfaces. Implemented in C++ for computational efficiency and wrapped in Julia for ease of use, XDiag provides a comprehensive toolkit for ED calculations. Key features of XDiag include the first publicly accessible implementation of sublattice coding algorithms for large-scale spin system diagonalizations, efficient Lin table algorithms for symmetry lookups, and random-hashing techniques for distributed memory parallelization. The library supports various Hilbert space types (e.g., spin-1/2, electron, and t-J models), facilitates symmetry-adapted block calculations, and automates symmetry considerations. The package is complemented by extensive documentation, a user guide, reproducible benchmarks demonstrating near-linear scaling on thousands of CPU cores, and over 20 examples covering ground-state calculations, spectral functions, time evolution, and thermal states. By integrating high-performance computing with accessible scripting capabilities, XDiag allows researchers to perform state-of-the-art ED simulations and explore quantum many-body phenomena with unprecedented flexibility and efficiency.

Title: Chiral Gravitons on the Lattice
Authors: Hernan B. Xavier, Zeno Bacciconi, Titas Chanda, Dam Thanh Son, Marcello Dalmonte
Abstract: Chiral graviton modes are elusive excitations arising from the hidden quantum geometry of fractional quantum Hall states. It remains unclear, however, whether this picture extends to lattice models, where continuum translations are broken and additional quasiparticle decay channels arise. We present a framework in which we explicitly derive a field theory incorporating lattice chiral graviton operators within the paradigmatic bosonic Harper-Hofstadter model. Extensive numerical evidence suggests that chiral graviton modes persist away from the continuum, and are well captured by the proposed lattice operators. We identify geometric quenches as a viable experimental probe, paving the way for the exploration of chiral gravitons in near-term quantum simulation experiments.

Title: Quantum geometry and dipolar dynamics in the orbital magneto-electric effect
Authors: James H. Cullen, Daniel P. Arovas, Roberto Raimondi, Dimitrie Culcer
Abstract: We show that the orbital magneto-electric effect (OME) -- the generation of a steady-state orbital angular momentum density -- is partly the result of a nonequilibrium dipole moment generated via Zitterbewegung and proportional to the quantum metric. For tilted massive Dirac fermions this dipole gives the only contribution to the OME in the insulating case, while the intrinsic and extrinsic OMEs occur for different electric field orientations, yielding an experimental detection method. Our results suggest quantum metric engineering as a route towards maximizing orbital torques.

Title: The Physics of Local Optimization in Complex Disordered Systems
Authors: Mutian Shen, Gerardo Ortiz, Zhiqiao Dong, Martin Weigel, Zohar Nussinov
Abstract: Limited resources motivate decomposing large-scale problems into smaller, "local" subsystems and stitching together the so-found solutions. We explore the physics underlying this approach and discuss the concept of "local hardness", i.e., complexity from the local solver perspective, in determining the ground states of both P- and NP-hard spin-glasses and related systems. Depending on the model considered, we observe varying scaling behaviors in how errors associated with local predictions decay as a function of the size of the solved subsystem. These errors stem from global critical threshold instabilities, characterized by gapless, avalanche-like excitations that follow scale-invariant size distributions. Away from criticality, local solvers quickly achieve high accuracy, aligning closely with the results of the more computationally intensive global minimization. These findings shed light on how Nature may operate solely through local actions at her disposal.

Title: Electronic structure and exchange interactions in altermagnetic MnGeP$_2$ in the quasiparticle-self-consistent $GW$ approach
Authors: Ilteris K. Turan, Walter R L. Lambrecht, Jerome Jackson
Abstract: The QS$GW$ method is used to study the electronic band structure, optical dielectric function, and exchange interactions in chalcopyrite, $I\bar{4}2d$, structure MnGeP$_2$. The material is found to be an antiferromagnetic semiconductor with lowest direct gap of 2.44 eV at the $\Gamma$ point and an indirect gap of 2.16 eV. The spin splittings along a low symmetry line like $PN$ are sizable, while at {\bf k}-points on the diagonal mirror planes or on the twofold symmetry axes the spin splitting is zero. The exchange interactions are calculated using a linear response approach. The antiferromagnetic exchange-interaction between nearest neighbors in the primitive unit cell is dominating and found to be slightly decreasing upon carrier doping. The transverse spin susceptibilities, which provide interatomic site exchange interactions after averaging over the muffin-tin spheres, are calculated from the $GW$ band structure and wave functions. From these exchange interactions, the spin wave spectra are obtained along the high symmetry lines and the Néel temperature is calculated using the mean-field, and Tyablikov estimations. The dielectric function and the optical absorption spectra are calculated including excitonic effects using the Bethe Salpeter equation. The exchange interactions around Mn$_{\rm Ge}$ defect sites is also studied. While we find it can generate ferromagnetic interactions with neighboring spins, we did not find evidence of producing an overall ferromagnetic phase. If Mn antisites are introduced by exchanging Mn with a nearby Ge, the interactions stay largely antiferromagnetic. Adding Mn antisites leads to a metallic band structure.

Title: Doping-induced Spin Reorientation in Kagome Magnet TmMn6Sn6
Authors: Mohamed El Gazzah, Po-Hao Chang, Y. Lee, Hari Bhandari, Resham Regmi, Xiuqan Zhou, John F. Mitchell, Liqin Ke, Igor I. Mazin, Nirmal J. Ghimire
Abstract: The kagome-lattice compounds RMn6Sn6 (R is a rare earth element), where the Mn atoms form a kagome net in the basal plane, are currently attracting a great deal of attention as they have been shown to host complex magnetic textures and electronic topological states strongly sensitive to the choice of the R atom. Among the magnetic R atoms, TmMn6Sn6 orders with the easy-plane magnetization forming a complex magnetic spiral along the c-axis. Previous neutron studies, carried on polycrystalline, samples found that Ga doping changes the magnetic anisotropy from easy-plane to easy-axis. Here we present magnetic and magnetotransport measurements on a single crystal and first principles calculations in the doping series of TmMn6Sn6-xGax. We find that the magnetic properties are highly sensitive even to a small concentration of Ga. With minimal Ga substitution, the easy-plane anisotropy is maintained, which gradually changes to the easy-axis anisotropy with increasing Ga. We discuss these observations with respect to the effect of Ga doping on magnetocrystalline anisotropy and Tm crystal field

Title: Multi-channel second-order topological states in 3D Dirac semimetal Bi$_{0.97}$Sb$_{0.03}$
Authors: Biplab Bhattacharyya, Stijn R. de Wit, Zhen Wu, Yingkai Huang, Mark S. Golden, Alexander Brinkman, Chuan Li
Abstract: Second-order topological insulating (SOTI) states in three-dimensional materials are helical dissipation-less one-dimensional (1D) hinges, which are of great interest for fundamental physics and potential topological quantum computing. Here, we report the discovery of SOTI states in Bi$_{0.97}$Sb$_{0.03}$ nano-flakes by tuning junction length, flake thickness, and temperature. We identify signatures of higher-order topology from a strong correlation between the fractional Shapiro step, a signature of 4$\pi$-periodic supercurrent, and the presence of the hinge states. Tight-binding simulations confirm the presence of multiple hinge modes, supporting our interpretation of Bi$_{0.97}$Sb$_{0.03}$ as a prototypical SOTI platform with tunable superconducting properties.

Title: Probing Vortex Dynamics in 2D Superconductors with Scanning Quantum Microscope
Authors: Sreehari Jayaram, Malik Lenger, Dong Zhao, Lucas Pupim, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Ruoming Peng, Marc Scheffler, Rainer Stöhr, Mathias S. Scheurer, Jurgen Smet, Jörg Wrachtrup
Abstract: The visualization of the magnetic responses of a two-dimensional (2D) superconducting material on the nanoscale is a powerful approach to unravel the underlying supercurrent behavior and to investigate critical phenomena in reduced dimensions. In this study, scanning quantum microscopy is utilized to explore the local magnetic response of the 2D superconductor 2H-NbSe2. Our technique enables both static and dynamic sensing of superconducting vortices with high sensitivity and a spatial resolution down to 30 nm, unveiling unexpected phenomena linked to the intrinsic 2D nature of the superconductor, which are challenging to detect with more conventional local probes. Vortices do not arrange in a hexagonal lattice, but form a distorted vortex glass with expanding vortex size. A vortex can exhibit strong local dynamics due to thermal excitation. As the critical temperature is approached, a clear melting of the vortex glass is identified, leading to distinct configurations under different cooling conditions. Vortex fluctuations can also be probed through spin Hahn-echo measurements, which reveal the spin decoherence even well below the critical temperature -- and, intriguingly, enhanced decoherence at lower temperatures. Spatiotemporal microscopy of the magnetic dynamics associated with vortex excitations and fluctuations provides direct evidence of 2D superconducting phenomena at the nanoscale.

Title: Ferroelectric Nematic and Smectic Liquid Crystals with Sub-Molecular Spatial Correlations
Authors: Parikshit Guragain, Arjun Ghimire, Manisha Badu, Netra Prasad Dhakal, Pawan Nepal, James T. Gleeson, Samuel Sprunt, Robert J. Twieg, Antal Jákli
Abstract: A number of highly polar three ring rod-shaped compounds with a terminal thiophene ring have been synthesized and the physical properties of a subset are reported in detail. On cooling from the isotropic fluid, they directly transition to a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (NF) phase that shows the strongest spatial correlations corresponding to 1/3 of the molecular length (L/3). The set of thiophene compounds reported here have ferroelectric polarizations about 20% larger than that of usual ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal materials. Such large polarization values are due to the ~20% larger mass densities of these thiophene compounds compared to most of the NF materials with short terminal chains. These unusual properties are consequences of tighter molecular packing due to the lack of flexible terminal chains. Below the NF phase, compounds with a single nitro or two cyano polar groups on the terminal benzene ring exhibit a so far never observed smectic phase with periodicity ~1/3 the molecular length. Based on our experimental results, we propose a model of this phase featuring antipolar packing of the molecules within the layers.

Title: Interplay of quantum and real-space geometry in the anomalous Landau levels of singular flat bands
Authors: Xuanyu Long, Feng Liu
Abstract: Quantum geometry of electronic state in momentum space, distinct from real-space structural geometry, has attracted increasing interest to shed light on understanding quantum phenomena. An interesting recent study [Nature 584, 59-63 (2020)] has numerically solved a 2-band effective Hamiltonian to show the anomalous Landau level (ALL) spreading $\mathit{\Delta}$ of a singular flat band (SFB), such as hosted in a kagome lattice, in relation to the maximal quantum distance $d$ of the SFB, $\mathit{\Delta}(d)$, which enables a direct measure of quantum geometry. Here, we investigate the ALLs of SFB by studying both the 2-band Hamiltonian and a diatomic kagome lattice hosting two SFBs mirrored by particle-hole symmetry. We derive an exact analytical solution of the 2-band Hamiltonian to show there are two branches of $\mathit{\Delta}(d)$. Strikingly, for the diatomic kagome lattice, $\mathit{\Delta}$ depends on not only $d$ but also $r$, the real-space diatomic distance. As $r$ increases, $\mathit{\Delta}$ shrinks toward zero while $d$ remains intact, which can be intuitively understood from the magnetic-field-induced disruption of destructive interference of the SFB compact localized states. Based on semiclassical theory, we derive rigorously the dependence of $\mathit{\Delta}$ on $r$ that originates from the tuning of the non-Abelian orbital moment of the two SFBs by real-space geometry.

Title: Neighbor-induced damage percolation
Authors: Lorenzo Cirigliano, Claudio Castellano
Abstract: We consider neighbor-induced damage percolation, a model describing systems where the inactivation of some elements may damage their neighboring active ones, making them unusable. We present an exact solution for the size of the giant usable component (GUC) and the giant damaged component (GDC) in uncorrelated random graphs. We show that, even for strongly heterogeneous distributions, the GUC always appears at a finite threshold and its formation is characterized by homogeneous mean-field percolation critical exponents. The threshold is a nonmonotonic function of connectivity: robustness is maximized by networks with finite optimal average degree. We also show that, if the average degree is large enough, a damaged phase appears, characterized by the existence of a GDC, bounded by two distinct percolation transitions. The birth and the dismantling of the GDC are characterized by standard percolation critical exponents in networks, except for the dismantling in scale-free networks where new critical exponents are found. Numerical simulations on regular lattices in D = 2 show that the existence of a GDC depends not only on the spatial dimension but also on the lattice coordination number.

Title: Atom-by-atom Imaging of Moiré Phasons using Electron Ptychography
Authors: Yichao Zhang, Ballal Ahammed, Sang Hyun Bae, Chia-Hao Lee, Jeffrey Huang, Mohammad Abir Hossain, Tawfiqur Rakib, Arend van der Zande, Elif Ertekin, Pinshane Y. Huang
Abstract: Twisted 2D materials exhibit unique vibrational modes called moiré phonons, which arise from the moiré superlattice. Here, we demonstrate atom-by-atom imaging of phasons, an ultrasoft class of moiré phonons in twisted bilayer WSe2. Using ultrahigh-resolution (<15 pm) electron ptychography, we image the size and shape of each atom to extract time-averaged vibrational amplitudes as a function of twist angle and position. We observe several signature properties of moiré phasons, such as increased vibrational amplitudes at solitons and AA-stacked regions. By correlating experiments with molecular dynamics simulations and lattice dynamics calculations, we show phasons dominate the thermal vibrations in low-angle twisted bilayers. These results represent a powerful route to image thermal vibrations at atomic resolution, unlocking experimental studies of a thus-far hidden branch of moiré phonon physics.

Title: Proper Orthogonal Decomposition of a Superfluid Turbulent Wake
Authors: Sota Yoneda, Hiromitsu Takeuchi
Abstract: Superfluid turbulent wakes behind a square prism are studied theoretically and numerically by proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). POD is a data science approach that can efficiently extract the principal vibration modes of a physical system, and is widely used in hydrodynamics, including applications in wake structure analysis. It is not straightforward to apply the conventional POD method to superfluid wake systems, as the superfluid velocity field diverges at the center of a vortex whose circulation is quantized. We successfully established a POD method by applying appropriate blurring to the vorticity distribution in a two-dimensional superfluid wake. It is shown that a coherent structure corresponding to two parallel arrays of alternating quantum vortex bundles, called the "quasi-classical" Kármán vortex street, is latent as a distinctive major mode in the superfluid turbulent wakes that were naively thought to be "irregular". Since our method is also effective for fluid density, it can be applied to the experimental data analysis for ultra-cold atomic gases.

Title: Analytic Expressions for Most $f^n$ Valence Multiplet Eigenvalues
Authors: Thomas P. Devereaux
Abstract: It is well know that many full atomic multiplet codes are available for experimentalists to check x-ray absorption or emission spectra against known valence materials to identify effect valence configuration of transition metal ions as well as their ligands. This has grown recently with the continued development of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering as a general tool that can characterize orbital, spin, charge, and lattice excitations in quantum materials. In this note, I show that all multiplet eigenstates for most $f^n$ configurations can be obtained analytically. I correct prior misprints in the literature and present new results for $f$-electrons. These results can serve as checks against new and developed numerical codes, and further provide experimentalists with deeper insights into the many configurations probed by advanced x-ray spectroscopies.

Title: Enhancing Contrast and Resolution for Electron-beam Lithography on Insulating Substrates
Authors: Deepak Kumar, Cooper Meyers, RJ Smith, J. Todd Hastings
Abstract: We report on the effect of ambient gas on the contrast and the resolution of electron beam lithography (EBL) in gaseous environments on insulating substrates. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films were exposed in an environmental scanning electron microscope using a 30 keV electron-beam under 1 mbar pressure of helium, water, nitrogen and argon. We found that the choice of ambient gas results in significant variations in contrast, and the clearing dose increases with the gases molecular weight and proton number, consistent with the increase in scattering cross-section. Significantly higher contrast values are obtained for exposure under helium and are accompanied by improved sensitivity. Despite higher sensitivity, helium exhibited the best resolution with 20-nm half-pitch dense lines and spaces. However, water vapor offered a larger process window, particularly on fused silica substrates. We also demonstrate that higher sensitivity results from effective charge dissipation. Thus, for EBL on insulating substrates, helium and water vapor may be desirable choices for charge dissipation depending on the substrate and process conditions.

Title: The unidirectional Seebeck detection of the Néel vector in the two-dimensional tetragonal $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic materials
Authors: Ya-Ting Xiao, Ying-Li Wu, Jia-Liang Wan, Xiao-Qin Yu
Abstract: The efficient detection of the reversal (180$^{\circ}$ rotation) of the Néel vector is one of the crucial tasks in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a thermal approach to detect the reversal of the Néel vector in the tetragonal $\mathcal{PT}$ antiferromagnetic materials through the unidirectional Seebeck effect (USE). Being different from the previous works in which USE stems from the global Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or asymmetric magnon scattering, we find that the USE originates from the coupling of the hidden Rashba SOC and the Néel vector in the tetragonal $\mathcal{PT}$ antiferromagnetic materials in the absence of the global Rashba SOC. Using a generic minimal model, we analyse the behaviors of the USE for the two-dimensional tetragonal lattice $\mathcal{PT}$ antiferromagnet. Importantly, It's found that when the Néel vector is reversed, the sign of the USE changes, which can be utilized to detect the reversal of the Néel vector.

Title: Finite-temperature properties of the prototypical perovskite CaTiO$_3$ from second-principles effective interatomic potential
Authors: Huazhang Zhang, Michael Marcus Schmitt, Louis Bastogne, Xu He, Philippe Ghosez
Abstract: We introduce a second-principles effective interatomic potential for the perovskite $\rm CaTiO_3$ (CTO), relying on a Taylor polynomial expansion of the Born-Oppenheimer energy surface around the cubic reference structure, in terms of atomic displacements and macroscopic strains. This model captures various phases of CTO, in particular successfully reproducing the structure, energy, and dynamical properties of the nonpolar $Pbnm$ ground state as well as the ferroelectric $R3c$ phase. The finite-temperature simulations suggest that the sequence of structural phase transitions over heating of CTO is: $Pbnm \ (a^-a^-c^+) \rightarrow C2/m \ (a^-b^-c^0) \rightarrow I4/mcm \ (a^-c^0c^0) \rightarrow Pm\bar{3}m \ (a^0a^0a^0)$, during which the oxygen octahedral rotations around the three pseudocubic axes vanish progressively. The model also provides the opportunity of investigating the properties of the ferroelectric $R3c$ phase, which is a metastable phase free of lattice instability at zero Kelvin. Our model-based simulations confirm that the $R3c$ phase remains stable below a certain finite temperature. Additionally, we find that the minimum energy path connecting the $Pbnm$ and $R3c$ phases involves localized layer-by-layer flipping of octahedral rotations. A similar mechanism is also observed in the thermal destabilization process of the $R3c$ phase toward the $Pbnm$ ground state in our simulation.

Title: Ultrafast dynamics of atomic correlated disordering in photoinduced VO$_2$
Authors: Wen-Hao Liu, Feng-Wu Guo, Lin-Wang Wang, Jun-Wei Luo
Abstract: Recent experiments suggest that atomic disordering dynamics are more universal than conventional coherent processes in photoinduced phase transitions (PIPTs), yet its mechanism remains unclear. Using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT), we find that, at lower photoexcitation, higher lattice temperature accelerates atomic disordering, which thereby lowers the threshold for phase transition, by thermally exciting more phonons to randomize the lattice vibrations in VO$_2$. Above this threshold, however, we observe that the transition timescale and atomic disordering become temperature-independent since thermally excited lattice vibrations induce a similar evolution of photoexcited holes. Additionally, we show that photoexcitation initially elongates the V-V dimers followed by a rotation with tangential displacements (along the z-axis) mediated by O atoms, resulting in strongly correlated motion along the z-axis. Consequently, atomic disordering is more dominant along the x direction, attributed to the relatively unrestricted motion of V-V dimers along this direction. The motion of V atoms along the z-axis is more constrained, leading to less disorder along the z-axis, which results in a "correlated disorder" phenomenon. This anisotropic disordering in VO$_2$ offers new insights into PIPTs mechanisms, guiding future studies on photoinduced disordered transitions.

Title: Scaling of Quantum Geometry Near the Non-Hermitian Topological Phase Transitions
Authors: Y R Kartik, Jhih-Shih You, H. H. Jen
Abstract: The geometry of quantum states can be an indicator of criticality, yet it remains less explored under non-Hermitian topological conditions. In this work, we unveil diverse scalings of the quantum geometry over the ground state manifold close to different topological phase transitions in a non-Hermitian long-range extension of the Kitaev chain. The derivative of the geometric phase, as well as its scaling behavior, shows that systems with different long-range couplings can belong to distinct universality classes. Near certain criticalities, we further find that the Wannier state correlation function associated with extended Berry connection of the ground state exhibits spatially anomalous behaviors. Finally, we analyze the scaling of the quantum geometric tensor near phase transitions across exceptional points, shedding light on the emergence of novel universality classes.

Title: Enhanced Patterned Fluorescence from Polystyrene through Focused Electron Beam Irradiation under Various Gases
Authors: Deepak Kumar, Joseph W. Brill, J. Todd Hastings
Abstract: We report on a novel method for tuning and enhancing fluorescence from irradiated polystyrene through electron-beam exposure in gaseous environments. We describe the effect of electron dose and ambient gas on the photoluminescence spectra and yield of irradiated PS films on insulating and conductive substrates. PS films were exposed in an environmental scanning electron microscope using a 20 keV electron beam, ambient gas pressures from high vacuum to 3 mbar, and electron doses from 1.8 to 45 mC cm-2. Irradiated PS films were characterized using confocal microscopy, TEM, EDS and FTIR spectroscopy. From emission spectra collected using confocal microscopy we found that the emission wavelength and photon yield of the irradiated film can be tuned by both dose and gas pressure. The emission wavelength blue-shifts with increasing pressure and red-shifts with increasing dose enabling an overall tuning range of 451 - 544 nm. Significant enhancement in the PL intensity, up to 18 times on sapphire substrates under helium when compared to high vacuum, are observed. Overall, the highest PL yield is observed on soda lime glass substrates under argon. Also, the photon-yield on conductive substrates is significantly smaller than that yield from insulating substrates. TEM images revealed e-beam irradiated PS is amorphous in nature and elemental mapping EDS revealed no signs of film oxidation. FTIR spectroscopy revealed that under gaseous environments the decay of aromatic and aliphatic C-H stretches is reduced compared to the high vacuum exposure; in all cases, features associated with the phenyl rings are preserved. Localized e-beam synthesis of fluorophores in PS can be controlled by both dose and by ambient gas pressure. This technique could enable new approaches to photonics where fluorophores with tunable emission properties can be locally introduced by e-beam patterning.

Title: Computational Analysis of Interface-Driven Spin-Orbit Coupling in Molecular Adsorbates on Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Zihao Wang, Wan-Lu Li, Shaowei Li
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) lifts molecular orbital degeneracy, enabling bi-level electronic platforms suitable for next-generation digital devices. However, common light-atom molecular feedstocks exhibit weak SOC due to the absence of heavy elements. To enhance SOC without synthesizing new materials, we leverage interfacial interactions between molecules and transition-element-based solid-state materials. This computational study investigates SOC splitting in metal-phthalocyanine adsorbed on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) using density functional theory (DFT). The enhanced SOC splitting is attributed to strong orbital hybridization at the molecule-substrate interface. Specifically, Zn-phthalocyanine (ZnPC) on monolayer MoS2 achieves a notable SOC splitting of ~8 meV. Furthermore, when ZnPC forms self-assembled chains on MoS2, the splitting increases to ~20 meV, driven by the formation of hybrid bands modulated by molecular periodicity. These findings highlight the role of interfacial and intermolecular interactions in inducing and enhancing SOC in surface-adsorbed molecules, providing a new strategy for molecular spintronic materials without complex synthetic efforts.

Title: Mitigating parasitic contributions in measured piezoresponse for accurate determination of piezoelectric coefficients in Sc-alloyed-AlN thin films using piezo-response force microscopy
Authors: Ch Kishan Singh, K. Rajalakshmi, N. Balamurugan, Rakesh kumar, Mukul Gupta, R. Ramaseshan, Kiran Baraik
Abstract: We present a methodology to mitigate the effect of the parasitic electrostatic contribution usually present in piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) measurement for quantitative characterization of polycrystalline piezoelectric thin films using a case study on a set of Al1-xScxN thin films. It involves minimizing the voltage sensitivity of the measured piezoresponse by optimizing the optical lever sensitivity using the laser positioning of the beam-bounce system. Additionally, applying a dc-voltage offset (determined through Kelvin probe force microscopy) during PFM scans and positioning the probe over the interior or edge portion of the specimen are explored to minimize the local and non-local electrostatic tip-sample interaction. The results shows that the effective piezoelectric coefficient (d33-eff) of our c-axis oriented wurtzite (wz)-Al1.0Sc0.0N thin film is 4.9 pm per Volt. The highest enhancement in the d33-eff value occurred in the wz-Al0.58Sc0.42N thin film. Above x = 0.42, the d33-eff reduces due to phase-mixing of the wz-Al1-xScxN phase with cubic-Sc3AlN phase till the piezoelectricity finally disappear at x = 0.51

Title: Photocurrent generation from spin dynamics in antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetals
Authors: Kohei Hattori, Hikaru Watanabe, Ryotaro Arita
Abstract: Using real-time simulations, we explore the photocurrent induced by localized spin dynamics in antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetals. These materials exhibit strong spin-charge coupling because the energy scales of the electronic and spin systems are of the same order. The photocurrent response exhibits a pronounced peak reflecting the presence of the Dirac point at the resonance frequency of the localized spin system. This contribution plays a crucial role in the photocurrent generation when the electronic filling is set around the Dirac nodes in the Dirac semimetal. We also reveal that the photocurrent response exhibits a low-frequency divergence due to the modulation of the resonance frequency of the localized spin system. Our findings clarify that the photocurrent response arising from the spin dynamics reflects the band topology of the Dirac semimetals, and the localized spin dynamics plays an important role in the photocurrent generation.

Title: Stable partial dislocation complexes in GaN as charge carrier lifetime modifiers for terahertz device applications by molecular dynamics and first-principle simulations
Authors: Andrey Sarikov, Ihor Kupchak
Abstract: Wurtzite GaN is a promising material for applications in photoconductive THz radiation sources. For this purpose, the photogenerated charge carriers lifetime of the order of tenths of picoseconds is required. A controllable lifetime reduction may be considered to achieve by creating recombination active stable dislocation complexes formed by mobile basal-plane Shockley partial dislocations (PDs). In this work, formation pathways and stability of PD complexes in basal planes of wurzite GaN are studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The simulations reveal the formation of stable complexes by attractive interaction of two 30° or two 90° PDs with opposite Burgers vectors located in consecutive (0001) planes. Ones formed, these complexes change neither their positions, not the atomic configurations during simulated anneal at 1500 K up to the times of 5 ns. The MD results are used as an input for density functional theory calculations to refine the atomic structures of the complex cores and to investigate their electronic properties. The calculated band structures of GaN with 30°-30° and 90°-90° dislocation complexes indicate localized energy levels in the band gap near the top of the valence band and the conduction band bottom. The calculations of the partial electronic states density confirm the possibility of electron-hole recombination between the states localized at the PD complex cores. These recombination characteristics are distinctly reflected in the calculated absorption spectra. We conclude that creating such PD complexes in required concentration may be a tool for tailoring the recombination properties of wurtzite GaN for THz radiation generation applications.

Abstract: We present a thorough analysis of the linearized stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE) describing finite temperature in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Our study reveals an optimal choice for the cut-off that divides the Bose gas into a low energy coherent region forming a classical wave and a high energy thermal cloud acting as a reservoir. Moreover, it highlights the relevance of energy damping, the number conserving scattering between thermal and coherent atoms. We analyze the equilibrium properties and near equilibrium relaxation of a homogeneous BEC in one, two and three dimensions at high phase space density, and calculate the autocorrelation function and power spectrum of the density and phase fluctuations. Simulations of the full non-linear SPGPE are in close agreement, and extend our arguments beyond the linear regime. Our work suggests the need for a re-examination of decay processes in BECs studied under the neglect of energy damping.

Title: Proximity Induced Non-collinear Magnetic States in Planar Superconductor/Ferromagnet Hybrids
Authors: A. A. Kopasov, S. V. Mironov, A. S. Mel'nikov
Abstract: The proximity induced superconducting (S) correlations in ferromagnetic (F) layers of planar S/F hybrids are shown to be responsible for the appearance of a nonlinear interaction between the magnetic moments of the F layers. This interaction originates from the combined influence of the orbital and exchange phenomena and can result in the spontaneous formation of non-collinear magnetic states in these systems. The proposed nonlinear coupling mechanism and resulting changes of magnetic textures are crucial for the design of the superconducting spintronics devices exploiting the long-range spin triplet proximity effect.

Title: Multilayer Crystal Field states from locally broken centrosymmetry
Authors: Owen Moulding, Makoto Shimizu, Amit Pawbake, Yingzheng Gao, Sitaram Ramakrishnan, Gaston Garbarino, Nubia Caroca-Canales, Jérôme Debray, Clément Faugeras, Christoph Geibel, Youichi Yanase, Marie-Aude Méasson
Abstract: Local charge, spin, or orbital degrees of freedom with intersite interactions are oftentimes sufficient to construct most quantum orders. This is conventionally true for f-electron systems, where the extent of the f-electrons and their associated crystal-electric-field (CEF) states are strongly localized. Here, polarized Raman spectroscopy measurements of a locally non-centrosymmetric compound, CeCoSi, unveil more CEF excitations than expected in the local model. We interpret this as experimental evidence for the entanglement of CEF states between cerium layers. This composite sublattice, spin, and orbital degree of freedom provides an unconsidered means to form novel orders, not only in this system, but in any system exhibiting globally preserved yet locally broken centrosymmetry.

Title: Constraints on magnetism and correlations in RuO$_2$ from lattice dynamics and Mössbauer spectroscopy
Authors: George Yumnam, Parul R. Raghuvanshi, John D. Budai, Dipanshu Bansal, Lars Bocklage, Douglas Abernathy, Yongqiang Cheng, Ayman Said, Igor I. Mazin, Haidong Zhou, Benjamin A. Frandsen, David S. Parker, Lucas R. Lindsay, Valentino R. Cooper, Michael E. Manley, Raphaël P. Hermann
Abstract: We provide experimental evidence for the absence of a magnetic moment in bulk RuO$_2$, a candidate altermagnetic material, by using a combination of Mössbauer spectroscopy, nuclear forward scattering, inelastic X-ray and neutron scattering, and density functional theory calculations. Using complementary Mössbauer and nuclear forward scattering we determine the $^{99}$Ru magnetic hyperfine splitting to be negligible. Inelastic X-ray and neutron scattering derived lattice dynamics of RuO$_2$ are compared to density functional theory calculations of varying flavors. Comparisons among theory with experiments indicate that electronic correlations, rather than magnetic order, are key in describing the lattice dynamics.

Title: Sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell with efficiency of 18.2% enabled by a hole transport layer
Authors: Taowen Wang, Longfei Song, Saeed Bayat, Michele Melchiorre, Nathalie Valle, Adrian-Marie Philippe, Emmanuel Defay, Sebastjan Glinsek, Susanne Siebentritt
Abstract: Reducing the thickness of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells is a key objective in order to reduce production cost and to improve sustainability. The major challenge for sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 cells is the recombination at the backside. In standard Cu(In,Ga)Se2 backside recombination is suppressed by a bandgap gradient, acting as a back surface field. This gradient is difficult to maintain in sub-micron thick absorbers. In this study, a hole transport layer passivates the back contact and enables efficient sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells without the need of a Ga gradient. The backside passivation by the hole transport layer is as effective as an optimized Ga gradient, resulting in a significant increase in open-circuit voltage by 80 mV in comparison to the reference sample without passivation. Moreover, the hole transport layer exhibits good transport properties, leading to a fill factor as high as 77%. Photoluminescence quantum yield of 0.15% and solar cell efficiency above 18% are demonstrated in sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorbers.

Title: Quasi-bound layer breathing phonons inside perfect dislocations of lattice-relaxed twisted bilayers
Authors: V. V. Enaldiev
Abstract: Using multiscale modelling we investigate layer breathing phonons in MX$_2$ bilayers (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se) containing dislocations specific for lattice-relaxed moiré superlattices. Spatial modulation of interlayer distance, caused by the dislocations, generates effective potentials that promote emergence of one-dimensional quasi-bound bands of layer breathing modes inside perfect dislocations forming in the bilayers with parallel and antiparallel alignment of layers. We show that for parallel MX$_2$ bilayers perfect dislocations host several quasi-bound bands, with frequencies above layer breathing mode in rhombohedral-stacked domains, whereas for antiparallel bilayers only a single quasi-bound band arises near the edge dislocation type, having frequencies above the layer breathing mode in 2H-stacked domains.

Title: Displacement and Stress Analysis of an Elastic Hollow Disk: Comparison with Strength of Materials' Prediction
Authors: Ken Okamura, Yosuke Sato, Satoshi Takada
Abstract: This paper analyzes the stress distribution in a two-dimensional elastic disk under diametric loading, with a focus on enhancing the understanding of concrete and rock materials' mechanical behavior. The study revisits the Brazilian test and addresses its high shear stress issue near loading points by exploring the ring test, which introduces a central hole in the disk. Using dynamic elasticity theory, we derive stress distributions over time and extend the analysis to static conditions. This approach distinguishes between longitudinal and transverse wave effects, providing a detailed stress field analysis. By drawing parallels with curved beam theories, we demonstrate the applicability of dynamic elasticity theory to complex stress problems, offering improved insights into the stress behavior in elastic disks.

Title: Synthesis and characterization of a $π$-extended Clar's goblet
Authors: Shantanu Mishra, Manuel Vilas-Varela, Igor Rončević, Fabian Paschke, Florian Albrecht, Leo Gross, Diego Peña
Abstract: Concealed non-Kekulé polybenzenoid hydrocarbons have no sublattice imbalance yet cannot be assigned a classical Kekulé structure, leading to an open-shell ground state with potential application in organic spintronics. They constitute an exceedingly small fraction of the total number of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons that can be constructed for a given number of benzenoid rings, and their synthesis remains challenging. The archetype of such a system is Clar's goblet (C$_{38}$H$_{18}$), a diradical proposed by Erich Clar in 1972 and recently synthesized on a Au(111) surface. Here, we report the synthesis of a pi-extended Clar's goblet (C$_{76}$H$_{26}$), a tetraradical concealed non-Kekulé polybenzenoid hydrocarbon, by a combined in-solution and on-surface synthetic approach. By means of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy, we characterized individual molecules adsorbed on a Cu(111) surface. We provide insights into the electronic properties of this elusive molecule, including the many-body nature of its ground and excited states, by mean-field and multiconfigurational quantum chemistry calculations.

Title: Competitive Adsorption in Polymer Nanocomposites: The Molecular Weight and End-Group Effect Revealed by SANS and MD Simulations
Authors: Tae Yeon Kong, WooJin Kim, YongJoo Kim, So Youn Kim
Abstract: Understanding polymer adsorption at interfaces is essential for designing advanced polymer-based nanomaterials with tailored interfacial properties. Although adsorption significantly influences the macroscopic properties of polymer composites and thin films, a comprehensive understanding of molecular weight (MW)-dependent adsorption remains challenging and controversial, particularly in polydisperse polymer systems, due to the limitations of experimental approaches. We investigate competitive adsorption in bidisperse poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) melts and find that shorter chains preferentially adsorb onto nanoparticle surfaces. Experiments and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the high density of terminal hydroxyl groups in short PEG chains strengthens hydrogen bonding at the interface, driving enthalpy-driven adsorption despite identical polymer backbones. This leads to a densely packed interfacial layer that alters the conformation of longer chains. These findings highlight the critical role of end-group functionality in interfacial polymer behavior and provide new insights for tailoring nanocomposite properties.

Title: Defect-Bound Excitons in Topological Materials
Authors: Roni Majlin Skiff, Sivan Refaely-Abramson, Raquel Queiroz, Roni Ilan
Abstract: Excitons, bound states of electrons and holes, are affected by the properties of the underlying band structure of a material. Defects in lattice systems may trap electronic defect states, to which an electron can be excited to form defect-bound excitons. Here, we examine the effect of band topology on excitons in systems with a single-site defect. We show that in the topological phase, when robust, in-gap, ring-shaped electronic states appear around defects, excitons inherit the properties of these ring states: The excitons' binding energies are lowered as a result of the wide spatial profile of the defect state, and their wave functions have complex shapes and order due to the mixed orbital character of the topological bands. Our study advances the understanding of the role of topology in modifying and controlling defect-bound excitons in quantum materials.

Title: Density of States Proportion on Charge Transfer Kinetics in Breathing Fermionic Systems of Molecules and Materials: A Perspective of Entropy-Ruled Method
Authors: Karuppuchamy Navamani
Abstract: Conceptualization, theory, method developments and implementations are always of great importance and an interesting task to explore a new dimension in science and technology, which is highly solicited for various functional-driven potential applications (e.g., electronic devices, charge storage devices). Numerous experimental and theoretical studies urge the necessity of a new theory or method to quantify the exact value of charge transport (CT) calculations (e.g., mobility and conductivity) through the appropriate process and methods. With this motivation, the entropy-ruled charge dynamics method has been recently proposed, which unifies band and hopping transport mechanism via quantum-classical transition analogy. Here, the energy (in terms of chemical potential) scaled entropy has a direct proportion with the density of states (DOS); and hence it is termed as DOS proportion. This proportion principally acts as a key descriptor for charge transport calculations in both molecular and materials systems, which is directly connected with all CT quantities like mobility, conductivity, current density etc. This perspective explains a unique nature of entropy-ruled method for the entire transport range from delocalized band to localization (or hopping) transport. The validity and limitations of Einstein relation and Boltzmann approach are discussed with different limits and physical conditions for disordered molecules and periodic systems. Finally, the futuristic scope and expected progress is addressed for correlated electron dynamical systems and devices. It is well-noted that the new DOS proportion and related entropy-ruled transport formalism are fundamentally more important for nurturing semiconducting science and technology towards a new era.

Title: Parametrically amplified Josephson plasma waves in YBa_2Cu_3O_(6+x): evidence for local superconducting fluctuations up to the pseudogap temperature $T^*$
Authors: Marios H. Michael, Eugene Demler, Patrick Lee
Abstract: A number of experiments have reported evidence for the existence of the lower Josephson plasmon mode in underdoped YBCO up to the pseudogap temperature scale when the sample is subject to intense terahertz pulses. Evidences include the observation of a reflectivity edge that resembles that of the superconducting state, and the second harmonic generation of a probe optical pulse that is modulated at a frequency similar the reflectivity feature. Since the lower Josephson plasmon mode is often associated with coherent oscillations between bilayers in the YBCO structure, these experiments have led to the suggestion that the intense pump has created pair coherence up to 350K. In this paper, we propose an alternative explanation of these experiments based on the model of short ranged superconducting correlations in the equilibrium state and using the Floquet perspective to analyze optical responses of the photoexcited state. Our model only requires local pairing with phase correlations that can be very short ranged when the system is at equilibrium at a temperature above Tc but below the pseudo-gap temperature T*. Within this assumption there is no phase coherence between bilayers. On the other hand the relative phase between members of the bilayer has a longer in-plane correlation which leads locally to a finite Josephson current. We show that the nonlinearity afforded by the local intra-bilayer Josephson current is sufficient to explain both the reflectivity and second harmonic generation data. The key point is that in the lower Josephson plasmon, the coupling between bilayers is mainly capacitive: the Josepson current between bilayers can be set to zero without affecting the parametric amplification process. The implication is that while superconducting coherence may not be created by the pump, the pseudogap phase must possess a local pairing amplitude at equilibrium.

Title: Surface Grafting of Graphene Flakes with Fluorescent Dyes: A Tailored Functionalization Approach
Authors: Ylea Vlamidis, Carmela Marinelli, Aldo Moscardini, Paolo Faraci, Stefan Heun, Stefano Veronesi
Abstract: The controlled functionalization of graphene is critical for tuning and enhancing its properties, thereby expanding its potential applications. Covalent functionalization offers a deeper tuning of the geometric and electronic structure of graphene compared to non-covalent methods; however, the existing techniques involve side reactions and spatially uncontrolled functionalization, pushing research toward more selective and controlled methods. A promising approach is 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, successfully utilized with carbon nanotubes. In the present work, this method has been extended to graphene flakes with low defect concentration. A key innovation is the use of a custom-synthesized ylide with a protected amine group (Boc), facilitating subsequent attachment of functional molecules. Indeed, after Boc cleavage, fluorescent dyes (Atto 425, 465, and 633) were covalently linked via NHS ester derivatization. This approach represents a highly selective method of minimizing structural damage. Successful functionalization was demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and confocal microscopy, confirming the effectiveness of the method. This novel approach offers a versatile platform, enabling its use in biological imaging, sensing, and advanced nanodevices. The method paves the way for the development of sensors and devices capable of anchoring a wide range of molecules, including quantum dots and nanoparticles. Therefore, it represents a significant advancement in graphene-based technologies.

Title: Effective Field Theory of Superconductivity
Authors: Yoonbai Kim, SeungJun Jeon, Hanwool Song
Abstract: A field theory of a Schrödinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair, a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a neutral scalar field of gapless acoustic phonon is proposed for superconductivity of s-waves. Presence of the gapless neutral scalar field is justified as low energy residual acoustic phonon degrees in the context of effective field theory. The critical coupling of quartic self-interaction of complex scalar field is computed from a 1-loop level interaction balance between the repulsion mediated by massive degree of the U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by massive Higgs degree, in the static limit. The obtained net attraction or repulsion in perturbative regime matches the type I or II superconductivity, respectively. We find the new critical coupling of cubic Yukawa type interaction between the neutral and complex scalar fields from another tree level interaction balance between the Coulomb repulsion mediated by massless degree of the U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by the gapless neutral scalar field, in the static limit. Superconducting phase is realized at or in the vicinity of this critical coupling. A huge discrepancy between the propagation speeds of photon and phonon gives a plausible explanation on low critical temperatures in conventional superconductors.

Title: Design principles of deep translationally-symmetric neural quantum states for frustrated magnets
Authors: Rajah P. Nutakki, Ahmedeo Shokry, Filippo Vicentini
Abstract: Deep neural network quantum states have emerged as a leading method for studying the ground states of quantum magnets. Successful architectures exploit translational symmetry, but the root of their effectiveness and differences between architectures remain unclear. Here, we apply the ConvNext architecture, designed to incorporate elements of transformers into convolutional networks, to quantum many-body ground states. We find that it is remarkably similar to the factored vision transformer, which has been employed successfully for several frustrated spin systems, allowing us to relate this architecture to more conventional convolutional networks. Through a series of numerical experiments we design the ConvNext to achieve greatest performance at lowest computational cost, then apply this network to the Shastry-Sutherland and J1-J2 models, obtaining variational energies comparable to the state of the art, providing a blueprint for network design choices of translationally-symmetric architectures to tackle challenging ground-state problems in frustrated magnetism.

Title: Robust quantum anomalous Hall effect with spatially uncorrelated disorder
Authors: Kristof Moors, Gen Yin
Abstract: In magnetic topological insulators, a phase transition between quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) and Anderson localization insulating phases can be triggered by the rotation of an applied magnetic field. Without the scattering paths along magnetic domains, this phase transition is governed by scattering induced by nonmagnetic disorder. We show that the QAH phase is strikingly robust in the presence of spatially uncorrelated disorder. The robustness is attributed to a resilience of the topological band gap against disorder, induced by quantum confinement. The critical behavior near the phase transition suggests that the scattering is distinct from quantum percolation. This provides new insights on the robustness of the QAH effect in magnetic topological insulators with atomic defects, impurities, and dopants.

Title: Intrinsic Attractive and Repulsive Interactions: From Classical to Quantum Gases in the Generalized Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution
Authors: Maryam Seifi, Zahra Ebadi, Hamzeh Agahi, Hossein Mehri-Dehnavi, Hosein Mohammadzadeh
Abstract: The thermodynamic parameter space is flat for an ideal classical gas with non-interacting particles. In contrast, for an ideal quantum Bose (Fermi) gas, the thermodynamic curvature is positive (negative), indicating intrinsic attractive (repulsive) interactions. We generalize the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution by employing a generalized form of the exponential function, proposing the Mittag-Leffler Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution within the framework of superstatistics. We demonstrate that the generalization parameter, $\alpha$, quantifies the statistical interaction. When $\alpha = 1$, the distribution coincides with the standard classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, where no statistical interaction is present. For $0 < \alpha < 1$ ($\alpha > 1$), the statistical interaction is repulsive (attractive), corresponding to a negative (positive) thermodynamic curvature of the system.

Title: Clarification of the Spontaneous Polarization Direction in Crystals with Wurtzite Structure
Authors: Simon Fichtner, Mohamed Yassine, Chris van de Walle, Oliver Ambacher
Abstract: The wurtzite structure is one of the most frequently found crystal structures in modern semiconductors and its inherent spontaneous polarization is a defining materials property. Despite this significance, confusion has been rampant in the literature with respect to the orientation of the spontaneous polarization inside the unit cell of the wurtzite structure, especially for the technologically very relevant III-N compounds (AlN, GaN, InN). In particular, the spontaneous polarization has been reported to either point up or down for the same unit cell orientation, depending on the literature source - with important implications for, e.g., the carrier type and density expected at interfaces of heterostructures involving materials with wurtzite-structure. This perspective aims to resolve this ambiguity by reviewing available reports on the direction of the energetically preferred polarization direction in the presence of external electric fields, as well as atomically resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy images. While we use ferroelectric wurtzite AlScN as a key example, our conclusions are generalizable to other compounds with the same crystal structure. We demonstrate that a metal-polar unit cell must be associated with an upward polarization vector - which is contrary to long-standing conventional wisdom.

Title: Defect analysis of the $β$- to $γ$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ phase transition
Authors: Umutcan Bektas, Maciej O. Liedke, Huan Liu, Fabian Ganss, Maik Butterling, Nico Klingner, René Hübner, Ilja Makkonen, Andreas Wagner, Gregor Hlawacek
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the ion-irradiation-induced phase transition in gallium oxide (Ga2O3) from the $\beta$ to the $\gamma$ phase, the role of defects during the transformation, and the quality of the resulting crystal structure. Using a multi-method analysis approach including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode (RBS/c), Doppler broadening variable energy positron annihilation spectroscopy (DB-VEPAS) and variable energy positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (VEPALS) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have characterized defects at all the relevant stages before, during, and after the phase transition. Reduction in backscattering yield was observed in RBS/c spectra after the transition to the $\gamma$ phase. This is corroborated by a significant decrease in the positron trapping center density due to generation of embedded vacancies intrinsic for the $\gamma$-Ga2O3 but too shallow in order to trap positrons. A comparison of the observed positron lifetime of $\gamma$-Ga2O3 with different theoretical models shows good agreement with the three-site $\gamma$ phase approach. A characteristic increase in the effective positron diffusion length and the positron lifetime at the transition point from $\beta$-Ga2O3 to $\gamma$-Ga2O3 enables visualization of the phase transition with positrons for the first time. Moreover, a subsequent reduction of these quantities with increasing irradiation fluence was observed, which we attribute to further evolution of the $\gamma$-Ga2O3 and changes in the gallium vacancy density as well as relative occupation in the crystal lattice.

Title: Crystal structural evolution of Ru$_3$Sn$_7$ under pressure and its implication on possible electronic changes
Authors: K. A. Irshad, P. Anees, Hrudananda Jena, Boby Joseph
Abstract: Ru$_3$Sn$_7$, an intermetallic compound with advanced catalytic properties, exhibits a complex crystal structure and intriguing electronic properties, making it an attractive candidate for investigations under high-pressure (HP). The structural, vibrational and electronic band structure of this compound were investigated at HP up to ~ 20 GPa using synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction, micro-Raman, and density functional theory (DFT), respectively. Despite the local structural changes implied by a discernible reduction in the compressibility and distinct slope changes in the pressure evolution of the symmetric stretching vibrations of the Ru and Sn atoms around 8 GPa, the cubic structure is found to be stable throughout the pressure range. In support, our calculated phonon dispersion relation confirmed the stability of the cubic phase till the highest pressures. A comprehensive analysis of the Raman spectrum reveals the signatures of the pressure induced sudden strengthening of electron-phonon coupling as early as 3 GPa which is backed by a bounce in the phonon and electron density of states (DoS). Electronic structure calculations demonstrate that the metallic nature of Ru$_3$Sn$_7$ is preserved in the studied pressure range with a minor redistribution of electronic DoS across the Fermi level (EF). The band structure calculations predict intriguing changes in the electronic structure, revealing the pressure induced dp hybridization through the high symmetry point of the Brillouin zone which is largely responsible for the observed reduction in the compressibility and enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling in Ru$_3$Sn$_7$.

Title: Computational assessment of non-polar and polar GaP terminations for photoelectrochemical water splitting
Authors: Sofia Apergi, Sreejith Pallikkara Chandrasekharan, Charles Cornet, Laurent Pedesseau
Abstract: With photoelectrochemical water splitting being one of the most promising approaches for clean energy production and storage, the search for efficient photoelectrode materials is greater than ever. Gallium phosphide (GaP) is a well-established semiconductor with suitable band edge positions that has already been successfully employed in photoelectrochemical solar cells. However, to utilize it as efficiently as possible, a proper understanding of its properties when interfaced with water is required, and this is currently lacking. In this work we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to study the properties of the aqueous interfaces of various GaP non-polar (110) and polar (001) terminations. We calculate their band alignment with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode potential and investigate their interfacial structural properties. Based on these properties we assess the capability of the various terminations to catalyze the reactions associated with water splitting and propose approaches for improving the performance of GaP for application in PECs.

Title: Self-Organized Three-Dimensional Superstructures, Spinodal Decomposition, and Mechanical Response of Epitaxial Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N Thin Films
Authors: M. Lorentzon, N. Takata, T. Zhu, G. Greczynski, R. Hahn, A. Zubayer, J. Palisaitis, H. Riedl, D. Kim, L. Hultman, J. Birch, N. Ghafoor
Abstract: Transition metal aluminum nitrides are a technologically important class of multifunctional ceramics. While the HfAlN system is to a large extent unexplored, we study phase stability, nanostructure design, and mechanical properties of rocksalt cubic (c-) phase and wurtzite-hexagonal (h-) phase Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$ thin films grown on MgO(001) substrates using ion-assisted reactive magnetron sputtering. Single-crystal c-Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$ films were obtained with $x < 0.30$. Spinodal decomposition taking place during film deposition resulted in a three-dimensional checkerboard superstructure of AlN-rich and HfN-rich nanodomains, as opposed to a metastable cubic solid solution. Lattice-resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy and x-ray and electron diffraction reveals that the superstructure period is along all three <100> directions and scales almost linearly between 9-13 A with increasing Al content. For $x > 0.41$, however, nanocrystalline h-Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$ consisting of segregated Hf- and Al-rich nanodomains in a (0001) fiber texture forms. The nanoindentation hardness of these films increases sharply with x, from 26 GPa for HfNy, to 38 GPa for c-Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$, due to dislocation pinning at the superstructure strain fields. The hardness drops to 22 GPa for the softer h-Hf1-xAlxNy, still remaining considerably higher than that of a binary AlN. In micropillar compression testing, c-Hf$_{0.93}$Al$_{0.07}$N$_{1.15}$ exhibits a linear elastic response up until strain burst, with brittle fracture occurring at a much higher yield stress compared to HfN$_y$, on {110}<011> slip systems, which is attributed to superstructure inhibited dislocation motion. In contrast, h-Hf$_{0.59}$Al$_{0.41}$N$_{1.23}$ exhibits limited plasticity and a high yield stress followed by strain burst, attributed to the nanocrystalline structure.

Title: Interparticle heterostructures by spontaneous formation of Dirac nodal arc semimetal PtSn4 domains in nanoparticles produced by Supersonic Cluster Beam Deposition
Authors: Marc Heggen, José Enrique Martinez Medina, Emanuele Barborini
Abstract: In this study, we report on the spontaneous formation of highly ordered 2D layered domains of intermetallic phase PtSn4 in Sn nanoparticles of dimensions of the order of 10 nm during the gas aggregation process occurring in Supersonic Cluster Beam Deposition. Phase identification is based on High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy and on X-ray emission analysis coupled with Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy. We propose that PtSn4-ordered domains precipitate inside Sn nanoparticles once the temperature drops below 520°C upon collisional cooling with room temperature Argon, while the nanoparticles persist longer in a liquid state. Sn matrix eventually solidifies upon the sudden temperature drop due to the supersonic expansion. 2D-layered PtSn4 domains create interparticle heterostructures that disrupt the spherical symmetry typical of gas aggregation processes and separate the Sn particle into distinct parts. The Dirac nodal arc semimetal character of PtSn4 makes it particularly interesting for studying the transport mechanisms in nanogranular films obtained by the soft-assembling of such nanoparticles, which feature a network of heterostructures showing sequences of alternate PtSn4 2D domains and metallic \b{eta}-Sn necks.

Title: Active Learning for Predicting Polymer/Plasticizer Phase Behaviour
Authors: Lois Smith, Jessica Steele, Hossein Ali Karimi-Varzaneh, Paola Carbone
Abstract: Plasticisers (PLs) are small additives commonly incorporated into polymer composites to enhance processability and improve mechanical properties. Their effectiveness depends heavily on their miscibility within the polymer melt, yet isolating the influence of plasticiser properties, such as flexibility and geometry, remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the time consuming nature of experimental work and also from the presence of impurities and inconsistencies that often arise during synthesis and testing. Atomistic simulations face similar difficulties as phase separation can occur over microsecond timescales, which can be computationally expensive. In this work, we use a coarse-grained bead-and-spring model to screen plasticisers of varying flexibilities and geometries to build a pool-based active learning procedure which characterizes their design space and its effect on polymer/plasticiser miscibility. We perform an active learning cycle with a random forest model and an uncertainty/random hybrid query strategy to determine the miscibility behaviour of queried molecules. This is evaluated through computationally expensive, coarse-grained polymer/plasticiser simulations of a cis-(1,4)-polyisoprene melt filled with small hydrocarbon additives of varying sizes and rigidities. Through this, we are able to efficiently improve model performance in order to make predictions on the entire PL design space. Such findings enable us to determine a new set of general plasticiser design rules, suitable for non-polar molecules, which expands on our previous work. To further prove this, we perform atomistic simulations of polyisoprene/plasticiser systems which are approximately back-mapped from their coarse-grained equivalents. Our findings indicate that the polyisoprene/plasticiser phase behaviour, observed using the coarse-grained model for PLs in the absence of side chains, is valid.

Title: Accelerating the development of oxynitride thin films: A combinatorial investigation of the Al-Si-O-N system
Authors: Stefanie Frick (1), Oleksandr Pshyk (1), Arnold Müller (2), Alexander Wieczorek (1), Kerstin Thorwarth (1), Sebastian Siol (1) ((1) Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Dübendorf, Switzerland (2) Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics, ETH Zurich, Zürich, Switzerland)
Abstract: Oxynitrides are used in a variety of applications including photocatalysts, high-k dielectrics or wear-resistant coatings and often show intriguing multi-functionality. To accelerate the co-optimization of the relevant material properties of these compositionally complex oxynitride systems, high-throughput synthesis and characterization methods are desirable. In the present work, three approaches were investigated to obtain orthogonal anion and cation gradients on the same substrate by magnetron sputtering. The different approaches included varying positions of the local reactive gas inlets and different combinations of target materials. The best performing approach was applied to screen a large two-dimensional area of the quaternary phase space within the Al-Si-O-N system. This material system is a promising candidate for transparent protective coatings with variable refractive indices. With only five depositions of combinatorial libraries, an anion composition range of 2-46% O/(N+O) and a cation composition range of 4-44% Si/(Al+Si) is covered. For lower oxygen and silicon contents, a region with hardness of up to 25 GPa is observed, where the material exhibits either wurtzite AlN or a composite microstructure. By increasing the deposition temperature to 400 °C, an extension of this region can be achieved. At higher oxygen and silicon contents, the structure of the samples is X-ray amorphous. In this structural region, an intimate correlation between hardness and refractive index is confirmed. The results of this study introduce a practical approach to perform high-throughput development of mixed anion materials, which is transferable to many materials systems and applications.

Title: Leveraging high fluence and low pressure for pulsed laser deposition of high-mobility $γ$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructure growth
Authors: Thor Hvid-Olsen, Christina Hoegfeldt, Amit Chanda, Alessandro Palliotto, Dae-Sung Park, Thomas Sand Jespersen, Felix Trier
Abstract: High-mobility oxide heterostructures could be applied for high-frequency devices, transparent conductors, and spin-orbit logic devices. SrTiO$_3$ is one of the most studied oxide substrate materials for heterostructures. To date, the highest SrTiO3-based charge carrier mobility at 2 K was measured in the interfacial 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$. The formation mechanism and origin of the high electron mobility are not yet fully understood. This investigation presents a successful growth protocol to synthesise high mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces, and a description of the underlying growth optimisation. Furthermore, indicative features of high-mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$, including the room-temperature sheet resistance, are presented. Signs of epitaxial and crystalline growth are found in a high-mobility sample ($\mu^{10K} = 1.6 \times 10^4 \mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{Vs}$). Outlining the growth mechanisms and comparing 40 samples, indicates that high-fluence ($F > 3\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{cm}^2$) and low pressure ($P \approx 1 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{mbar}$) are essential growth parameters for high-mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces.

Title: Bridging constrained random-phase approximation and linear response theory for computing Hubbard parameters

Abstract: The predictive accuracy of popular extensions to density-functional theory (DFT) such as DFT+U and DFT plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) hinges on using realistic values for the screened Coulomb interaction U. Here, we present a systematic comparison of the two most widely used approaches to compute this parameter, linear response theory (LRT) and the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA), using a unified framework based on the use of maximally localized Wannier functions to define the underlying basis sets. We demonstrate good quantitative agreement between LRT and cRPA in cases where the strongly interacting subspace corresponds to an isolated set of bands. Differences can be assigned to neglecting the response of the exchange-correlation potential in cRPA and the presence of additional screening channels in LRT. Moreover, we show that in cases with strong hybridization between interacting and screening subspaces, the application of cRPA becomes ambiguous and can lead to unrealistically small U values, while LRT remains well-behaved. Our work clarifies the relation between both methods, sheds light on their strengths and limitations, and emphasizes the importance of using a consistent set of Wannier orbitals to ensure transferability of U values between different implementations.

Title: Large Topological Magnetic Optical Effects and Imaging of Antiferromagnetic Octupole Domains of an Altermagnet-like Weyl Semimetal
Authors: Xingyue Han, Xiaoran Liu, Mikhail Kareev, Jak Chakhalian, Liang Wu
Abstract: Pyrochlore iridates have attracted significant interest due to their complex phase behavior arising from the interplay among electron correlations, quantum metric in flat bands, geometrically frustrated lattices, and topology induced by strong spin-orbit coupling. In this study, we focus on Eu$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ thin films oriented along the (111) crystallographic direction. This quantum material, identified as an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal, exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect in transport experiments. Here we employ optical circular dichroism microscopy, to directly image ferroic octupole order and resolve all-in--all-out and all-out--all-in antiferromagnetic domains below the Néel temperature. Remarkably, despite the absence of a detectable net magnetic moment at zero applied magnetic field, we detected a large magnetic circular dichroism signal ($\sim 10^{-4}$) and Kerr effect ($\sim 10^{-4}$ radians) in zero magnetic field attributable to Berry curvature effects from Weyl nodes. Eu$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ is a non-collinear magnet with vanishing net moment and magnetic octupole order, similar to the recently proposed collinear d-wave altermagnets, allowing for magneto-optical responses and anomalous Hall effect. This finding likely represents the first demonstration of magnetic circular dichroism and Kerr effect in a topologically non-trivial quantum antiferromagnet with a vanishing net magnetization. Our work opens up the possibility of ultrafast domain switching in the terahertz frequency and the domain wall dynamics in the magnetic Weyl systems, which establishes the foundation for topological antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Title: Nematic ordering via vertical stratification in drying clay nanotube suspensions
Authors: Arun Dadwal, Meenu Prasher, Nitin Kumar
Abstract: Evaporative self-assembly offers a simple, cost-effective method for producing functional nanostructured materials. However, achieving tunable and ordered assemblies remains challenging, especially when working with complex building blocks like nanoparticles that exhibit significant shape and size polydispersity. In this study, starting from an aqueous suspension of a polydisperse sample of rod-like Halloysite nanotubes, we present a physical protocol for producing a high degree of orientational ordering in the final dried deposit. By placing a sessile droplet on a substrate heated to 50°C, self-induced Marangoni flows suppress the coffee-ring effect, enabling more uniform deposition of colloidal rods. Subsequently, the vertical stratification during evaporation leads to the segregation of particles by aspect ratio, with longer rods (aspect ratio>=6.5) preferentially migrating to the top layers over the entire deposit. Since rods exceeding this threshold exhibit nematic ordering at high densities, the resulting top layer, spanning an area of the order of mm^2, displays a high degree of orientational order. Thus, our results highlight a robust strategy for engineering ordered structures from disordered colloidal suspensions despite the overall polydispersity of the system.

Title: Anomalous proximity effect under Andreev and Majorana bound states
Authors: Eslam Ahmed, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: We theoretically study the anomalous proximity effect in a ballistic normal metal/diffusive normal metal/superconductor junction based on Rashba semiconductor nanowire model. The system hosts two distinct phases: a trivial helical phase with zero-energy Andreev Bound States and a topological phase with Majorana Bound States. We analyze the local density of states and induced pair correlations at the edge of the normal metal region. We investigate their behavior under scalar onsite disorder and changing the Superconductor and diffusive regions lengths in the trivial helical and topological phases. We find that both phases exhibit a zero-energy peak in the local density of states and spin-triplet pair correlations in the clean limit, which we attribute primarily to odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs. Disorder rapidly splits the zero-energy peak in the trivial helical phase regardless of the lengths of the superconductor and diffusive normal regions. The zero-energy peak in the topological phase show similar fragility when the superconductor region is short. However, for long superconductor regions, the zero-energy peak in the topological phase remain robust against disorder. In contrast, spin-singlet correlations are suppressed near zero energy in both phases. Our results highlight that the robustness of the zero-energy peak against scalar disorder, contingent on the Superconductor region length, serves as a key indicator distinguishing trivial Andreev bound states from topological Majorana bound states.

Title: Critical habitat size of organisms diffusing with stochastic resetting
Authors: Luiz Menon, Pablo de Castro, Celia Anteneodo
Abstract: The persistence of populations depends on the minimum habitat area required for survival, known as the critical patch size. While most studies assume purely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly alter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are affected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to a common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or movement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total population growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are validated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings demonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the critical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external environmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation shapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling and conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in deforested regions.

Title: Many-Body Quantum Optics in a Bose-Hubbard Waveguide
Authors: Federico Roccati
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between quantum emitters and guided photons in one-dimension. When the waveguide hosts interacting photons, it becomes a platform to explore many-body quantum optics. However, the influence of photonic correlations on emitter dynamics remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the collective decay and coherent interactions of quantum emitters coupled to a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard waveguide, an array of coupled photonic modes with repulsive on-site interactions that supports superfluid and Mott insulating phases. We show that photon-photon interactions alone can trigger a superradiant burst, independent of emitter spacing and transition frequency. In the off-resonant regime, emitters exhibit two distinct types of mediated interactions: delocalized superfluid excitations yield distance-independent couplings, while Mott-insulator quasiparticles generate short-range interactions mediated by doublons and holons. Our work bridges many-body physics and waveguide QED, revealing how photonic many-body states shape emitter dynamics.

Title: Universality of the microcanonical entropy at large spin
Authors: Sridip Pal, Jiaxin Qiao, Balt C. van Rees
Abstract: We consider rigorous consequences of modular invariance for two-dimensional unitary non-rational CFTs with $c > 1$. Simple estimates for the torus partition function can lead to remarkably strong results. We show in particular that the spectral density of spin-$J$ operators must grow like $\exp\left( \pi \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}(c-1) J} \right)/\sqrt{2J}$ in any twist interval at or above $(c-1)/12$, with a known twist-dependent prefactor. This proves that the large $J$ spectrum becomes dense even without averaging over spins. For twists below $(c-1)/12$ we establish that the growth must be strictly slower. Finally, we estimate how fast the maximal gap between two spin-$J$ operators must go to zero as $J$ becomes large.

Title: Probing mixed-state phases on a quantum computer via Renyi correlators and variational decoding
Authors: Yuxuan Zhang, Timothy H. Hsieh, Yong Baek Kim, Yijian Zou
Abstract: Recent advances have defined nontrivial phases of matter in open quantum systems, such as many-body quantum states subject to environmental noise. In this work, we experimentally probe and characterize mixed-state phases on Quantinuum's H1 quantum computer using two measures: Renyi correlators and the coding performance of a quantum error-correcting code associated with the phase. As a concrete example, we probe the low-energy states of the critical transverse field Ising model under different dephasing noise channels. First, we employ shadow tomography to observe a newly proposed Renyi correlator in two distinct phases: one exhibiting power-law decay and the other long-ranged. Second, we investigate the decoding fidelity of the associated quantum error-correcting code using a variational quantum circuit, and we find that a shallow circuit is sufficient to distinguish the above-mentioned two mixed-state phases through the decoding performance quantified by entanglement fidelity. Our work is a proof of concept for the quantum simulation and characterization of mixed-state phases.

Title: Sequential Generation of Two-dimensional Super-area-law States with Local Parent Hamiltonian
Authors: Wucheng Zhang
Abstract: We construct examples of highly entangled two-dimensional states by exploiting a correspondence between stochastic processes in $d$ dimensions and quantum states in $d+1$ dimensions. The entanglement structure of these states, which we explicitly calculate, can be tuned between area law, sub-volume law, and volume law. This correspondence also enables a sequential generation protocol: the states can be prepared through a series of unitary transformations acting on an auxiliary system. We also discuss the conditions under which these states have local, frustration-free parent Hamiltonians.

Title: Stabilizer-Accelerated Ground-State Estimation of Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Caroline E. P . Robin
Abstract: We investigate how the stabilizer formalism, in particular highly-entangled stabilizer states, can be used to describe the emergence of many-body shape collectivity from individual constituents, in a symmetry-preserving and classically efficient way. The method that we adopt is based on determining an optimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a residual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground state is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer tableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods.

Title: A Data-Driven Method for Modeling Creep-Fatigue Stress-Strain Behavior Using Neural ODEs
Authors: Hao Deng, Mark C. Messner
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a data-driven machine learning approach for modeling one-dimensional stress-strain behavior under cyclic loading, utilizing experimental data from the nickel-based Alloy 617. The study employs uniaxial creep-fatigue test data acquired under various loading histories and compares two distinct neural network-based ODE models. The first model, known as the black-box model, comprehensively describes the strain-stress relationship using a Neural ODE equation. To interpret this black-box model, we apply the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy) technique, transforming the black-box model into an equation-based model using symbolic regression. The second model, the Neural flow rule model, incorporates Hooke's Law for the linear elastic component, with the nonlinear part characterized by a Neural ODE. Both models are trained with experimental data to accurately reflect the observed stress-strain behavior. We conduct a detailed comparison with the standard Chaboche model, which includes three back stresses. Our results demonstrate that the neural network-based ODE models precisely capture the experimental creep-fatigue mechanical behavior, exceeding the standard Chaboche model's accuracy. Furthermore, an interpretable model derived from the black-box neural ODE model through symbolic regression achieves accuracy comparable to the Chaboche model, enhancing its interpretability. The results highlight the potential of neural network-based ODE models to depict complex creep-fatigue behavior, eliminating the necessity for experts to define a specific, material-focused model form.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping many aspects of materials science and chemistry research, enabling advances in molecular property prediction, materials design, scientific automation, knowledge extraction, and more. Recent developments demonstrate that the latest class of models are able to integrate structured and unstructured data, assist in hypothesis generation, and streamline research workflows. To explore the frontier of LLM capabilities across the research lifecycle, we review applications of LLMs through 34 total projects developed during the second annual Large Language Model Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry, a global hybrid event. These projects spanned seven key research areas: (1) molecular and material property prediction, (2) molecular and material design, (3) automation and novel interfaces, (4) scientific communication and education, (5) research data management and automation, (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation, and (7) knowledge extraction and reasoning from the scientific literature. Collectively, these applications illustrate how LLMs serve as versatile predictive models, platforms for rapid prototyping of domain-specific tools, and much more. In particular, improvements in both open source and proprietary LLM performance through the addition of reasoning, additional training data, and new techniques have expanded effectiveness, particularly in low-data environments and interdisciplinary research. As LLMs continue to improve, their integration into scientific workflows presents both new opportunities and new challenges, requiring ongoing exploration, continued refinement, and further research to address reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility.

Title: Hyperchaos and complex dynamical regimes in $N$-dimensional neuron lattices
Authors: Brandon B. Le, Dima Watkins
Abstract: We study the dynamics of $N$-dimensional lattices of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons coupled with a flow of electrical current. We consider both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, homogeneous and heterogeneous neurons, and small and large lattices over a wide range of electrical coupling strengths. As the coupling strength is varied, the neurons exhibit a number of complex dynamical regimes, including unsynchronized chaotic spiking, local quasi-bursting, synchronized chaotic bursting, and synchronized hyperchaos. For lattices in higher spatial dimensions, we discover dynamical effects arising from the ``destructive interference'' of many connected neurons and miniature ``phase transitions'' from coordinated spiking threshold crossings. In large two- and three-dimensional neuron lattices, we observe emergent dynamics such as local synchronization, quasi-synchronization, and lag synchronization. These results illustrate the rich dynamics that emerge from coupled neurons in multiple spatial dimensions, highlighting how dimensionality, connectivity, and heterogeneity critically shape the collective behavior of neuronal systems.

Title: Fabrication-Directed Entanglement for Designing Chiral and Anisotropic Metamaterial Foams
Authors: Daniel Revier, Jeffrey Ian Lipton
Abstract: Entangled networks are fundamental in various systems, from biological structures to engineered materials. Current techniques for programming entanglement often rely on intricate chemistry or result in statistically homogeneous networks, limiting the ability to create spatially patterned structures with precisely engineered functions. Thus, a key challenge remains in developing approaches to program complex mechanical behaviors, such as anisotropy and chirality, within monolithic entangled structures. This work introduces Fabrication-Directed Entanglement (FDE), a methodology integrating viscous thread printing (VTP) and topology optimization (TO) to program the entanglement of a single homogeneous filament. By spatially adjusting VTP parameters (deposition height, speed), we control local coiling density, creating quasi-two-phase (dense/sparse) regions within a monolithic entangled foam. Topology optimization guides the placement of these regions to achieve target macroscopic mechanical properties. Here we show foam-like mechanical metamaterials with tunable compliance, rigidity, and chirality. Experimental testing and simulation confirm that FDE expands the achievable material property space compared to homogeneous VTP foams, enabling properties like tunable directional stiffness, Poisson's ratios from $\nu\approx0.06~\text{to}~0.56$, and novel significant normal-shear coupling ($\eta_{212}\approx0.72$) from a single base material. This approach offers a viable new pathway for designing complex, functional entangled foam structures with tailored mechanical behaviors.

Title: Annealing Approximation in Master-Node Network Model
Authors: M. O. Hase, Anderson A. Ferreira, André C. R. Martins, Fernando F. Ferreira
Abstract: This paper investigates absorbing-state phase transitions in opinion dynamics through a master-node network model analyzed using annealing approximation. We develop a theoretical framework examining three fundamental regimes: systems converging to complete disagreement, complete consensus, or both states depending on initial conditions. The phase behavior is governed by two key chiral parameters - R measuring right-oriented influence and L measuring left-oriented influence in the network interactions. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram featuring both continuous and discontinuous transitions between disordered and ordered phases. The discontinuous transition emerges in systems with two absorbing states, where the final configuration depends critically on initial opinion distributions. The annealing approximation provides fundamental insights into how asymmetric social influences (chirality) shape collective opinion formation, acting as a symmetry-breaking element that drives the system toward polarization or consensus.

Title: Observation of optical vortex generation via magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering
Authors: Ryusuke Hisatomi, Alto Osada, Kotaro Taga, Haruka Komiyama, Takuya Takahashi, Shutaro Karube, Yoichi Shiota, Teruo Ono
Abstract: Exploration of physics involving orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, first recognized in 1992, is essential for deepening our understanding of the interaction between light and matter and that opens up new applications. In systems with rotational symmetry, it is known that OAM can be exchanged between light and matter. One of the most common applications of such a phenomenon is manipulating the optical OAM through the exchange of OAM between light and a nematic liquid crystal-based spatial light modulator (SLM). It is already being used as a tool in many studies related to the optical OAM. However, the operation bandwidth is limited by the response speed 100 Hz of the liquid crystal, which hinders the applications of the optical OAM to spatial division multiplexing, quantum communication, and optical microscopy. The generation of optical vortex beams with the optical OAM in inelastic scattering by elementary excitations with gigahertz-order resonance may solve this problem, although it has not been studied so far. Here, we demonstrate the generation of the optical vortex beams using magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering. We observe scattering rules in the Brillouin light scattering which can be explained by conservation of total angular momentum including spins and orbits with photons and magnons. This work serves as a starting point for research into the interaction between optical vertices and magnons. It opens up devices with the novel mechanism of optical OAM generation together with high operation bandwidth.

Title: Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy on dry Poly(vinyl alcohol)/Poly(vinylidene fluoride) blends reinforced with Nano-Graphene Platelets at combined pressure and temperature
Authors: Eirini Kolonelou, Anthony N. Papathanassiou
Abstract: Poly(vinyl alcohol)/Poly(vinylidene fluoride) blends at mass ratio 3:1 with Nano - Graphene Platelet fillers constitute mechanically and thermally stable systems, which are used for developing piezoelectric devices. Blends host a fraction of water molecules absorbed by the poly(vinyl alcohol) phase. Dc conductivity and dielectric relaxation occur via fluctuation induced tunneling of electrons. Electric charge transport is affected by the glass transition of the polymer matrix and the rotational and translational dynamics of absorbed water molecules. In the present work, absorbed water was subtracted by annealing and pumping and, subsequently, dry blends were characterized by employing Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy at combined temperature and pressure states. Conductivity and relaxation obey fluctuation induced tunneling temperature dependencies. The corresponding activation energies and activation volumes reveal the role of absorbed polar water molecules on the tunneling current for macroscopic or localized electron transport.

Title: Chess variation entropy and engine relevance for humans
Authors: Marc Barthelemy
Abstract: Modern chess engines significantly outperform human players and are essential for evaluating positions and move quality. These engines assign a numerical evaluation $E$ to positions, indicating an advantage for either white or black, but similar evaluations can mask varying levels of move complexity. While some move sequences are straightforward, others demand near-perfect play, limiting the practical value of these evaluations for most players. To quantify this problem, we use entropy to measure the complexity of the principal variation (the sequence of best moves). Variations with forced moves have low entropy, while those with multiple viable alternatives have high entropy. Our results show that, except for experts, most human players struggle with high-entropy variations, especially when $|E|<100$ centipawns, which accounts for about $2/3$ of positions. This underscores the need for AI-generated evaluations to convey the complexity of underlying move sequences, as they often exceed typical human cognitive capabilities, reducing their practical utility.

Title: Understanding Decoherence of the Boron Vacancy Center in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: András Tárkányi, Viktor Ivády
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a significant material for quantum sensing, particularly due to its ability to host spin active defects, such as the negatively charged boron vacancy (V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center). The optical addressability of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center and hBN's 2D structure enable high spatial resolution and integration into various platforms. However, decoherence due to the strong magnetic noise in hBN imposes fundamental limitations on the sensitivity of V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center-based applications. Understanding the phenomena behind decoherence and identifying parameter settings that provide the highest performance are essential for advancing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ sensors. This study employs state-of-the-art computational methods to investigate the decoherence of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center in hexagonal boron nitride across a wide range of magnetic field values from 0 T up to 3 T. The provided in-depth numerical and analytical analysis reveals an intricate interplay of various decoherence mechanisms. This study identifies five distinct magnetic field regions governed by different types of magnetic interactions with and within the abundant nuclear spin bath. In addition to magnetic field, the effects of zero-field splitting, nuclear polarization, and different hyperfine coupling terms are studied, representing an important step forward in utilizing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles in sensing. In particular, this study proposes operation in the moderate $180-350$ mT magnetic field range in chemically pure h$^{11}$B$^{15}$N samples, where the coherence time can reach $1-20$ $\mu$s, significantly exceeding the $\mathcal{O}( 100~\text{ns})$ low-field $T_2$ values.

Title: O(5) multicriticality in the 3D two flavor SU(2) lattice gauge Higgs model
Authors: Claudio Bonati, Ivan Soler Calero
Abstract: We numerically investigate the multicritical behavior of the three dimensional lattice system in which a SU(2) gauge field is coupled to two flavors of scalar fields transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. In this system a multicritical point is present, where the global symmetry O(2)$\oplus$O(3) gets enlarged to O(5). Such a symmetry enlargement is hindered for generic systems by the instability of the O(5) multicritical point, but the SU(2) gauge symmetry prevents the appearance of the term triggering the instability. All the numerical results obtained in this lattice gauge model fully support the expectations coming from the O(2)$\oplus$O(3) multicritical Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\phi^4$ theory, and we discuss possible implications of these results for some models of deconfined quantum criticality.

Title: Narrowline cooling of dysprosium atoms in an optical tweezer array
Authors: Giulio Biagioni, Britton Hofer, Nathan Bonvalet, Damien Bloch, Antoine Browaeys, Igor Ferrier-Barbut
Abstract: We perform narrowline cooling of single dysprosium atoms trapped in a 1D optical tweezers array, employing the narrow single-photon transition at 741 nm. At the trapping wavelength of 532 nm, the excited state is less trapped than the ground state. To obtain efficient cooling performances, we chirp the frequency of the cooling beam to subsequently address the red sidebands of different motional states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the cooling protocol through Raman thermometry, which we characterize for our experimental conditions. We obtain an array of 75 atoms close to the motional ground state in the radial direction of the tweezers. Our results demonstrate the possibility to manipulate the motional degree of freedom of dysprosium in optical tweezers arrays, a key ingredient to exploit the potential of lanthanide-based tweezers platforms for quantum science.

Title: Barrier induced stalemate-consensus transition of self-propelled participants subject to majority rule
Authors: Yan-Wen Xiao, Wei-Chen Guo, Bao-Quan Ai, Liang He
Abstract: Natural or artificial barriers, such as the Himalayas, the Berlin Wall, or the Korean Demilitarized Zone, can significantly impede human migration. As a consequence, they may also hinder the dissemination of opinions within society, thereby contributing to divergent geopolitical landscapes and cultural developments. This raises a fundamental question: how do such barriers influence the opinion dynamics of mobile agents, such as human beings? In particular, can a barrier induce transitions in collective opinion states among spatially segregated groups? Here, we investigate the opinion dynamics governed by majority rule in a minimal model comprising self-propelled agents with binary opinions performing random walks within a closed space divided by a barrier. We focus on the conditions under which initially segregated clusters of agents with opposing opinions can reach consensus. Our results reveal the existence of a critical barrier size that marks a transition between stalemate and consensus states. Near this critical point, the relaxation time to reach consensus from an initial stalemate exhibits a power-law divergence. This barrier-induced stalemate-consensus transition in a simple agent-based model offers new insights into the role of physical or social barriers in shaping opinion dynamics and social structures.

Title: Generalized Epsilon-Near-Zero Polaritons on Uniaxial Metasurfaces
Authors: Francisco Javier Alfaro-Mozaz, Iñigo Liberal
Abstract: Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) thin films facilitate strong light-matter interactions with a widespread impact in nonlinear, quantum and thermal photonics. Here, we extend the scope of thin film ENZ modes by elucidating the generalized polaritonic modes emerging from anisotropy and near-zero permittivity. Through a theoretical investigation of generalized ENZ polaritons on silicon carbide (SiC) metasurfaces, we reveal a complex polaritonic landscape, consisting of a seven-region phase diagram. We show that the complex interplay between material properties and geometry changes the nature of the modes, and we clarify when ENZ modes with closed and open isofrequency curves (IFCs) can be observed, and how they coexist with surface phonon-polaritons and hyperbolic modes. The associated photonic topological transitions are accompanied by phase velocity sign reversals and induce dramatic modifications of near-field profiles and Purcell enhancement factors. Our work merges insights from anisotropic and ENZ effects, enabling enhanced control over polariton behavior with broad implications for subwavelength optics, material design, nonlinear effects, thermal emission, and quantum technologies.

Title: Information-theoretic reduction of deep neural networks to linear models in the overparametrized proportional regime
Authors: Francesco Camilli, Daria Tieplova, Eleonora Bergamin, Jean Barbier
Abstract: We rigorously analyse fully-trained neural networks of arbitrary depth in the Bayesian optimal setting in the so-called proportional scaling regime where the number of training samples and width of the input and all inner layers diverge proportionally. We prove an information-theoretic equivalence between the Bayesian deep neural network model trained from data generated by a teacher with matching architecture, and a simpler model of optimal inference in a generalized linear model. This equivalence enables us to compute the optimal generalization error for deep neural networks in this regime. We thus prove the "deep Gaussian equivalence principle" conjectured in Cui et al. (2023) (arXiv:2302.00375). Our result highlights that in order to escape this "trivialisation" of deep neural networks (in the sense of reduction to a linear model) happening in the strongly overparametrized proportional regime, models trained from much more data have to be considered.

Title: Direct integration of atomic precision advanced manufacturing into middle-of-line silicon fabrication

Abstract: Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure, and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance, and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance, and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology, and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.

Title: Expedited thermalization dynamics in incommensurate systems
Authors: Mingdi Xu, Zijun Wei, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Lei Pan
Abstract: We study the thermalization dynamics of a quantum system embedded in an incommensurate potential and coupled to a Markovian thermal reservoir. The dephasing induced by the bath drives the system toward an infinite-temperature steady state, erasing all initial information-including signatures of localization. We find that initially localized states can relax to the homogeneous steady state faster than delocalized states. Moreover, low-temperature initial states thermalize to infinite temperature more rapidly than high-temperature states-a phenomenon reminiscent of the Mpemba effect, where hotter liquids freeze faster than warmer ones. The slowest relaxation mode in the Liouvillian plays critical role in the expedited thermalization for localized or cold initial states. Our results reveal that the combination of disordered structure and environmental dissipation may lead to non-trivial thermalization behavior, which advances both the conceptual framework of the Mpemba effect and the theoretical understanding of nonequilibrium processes in dissipative disordered systems.

Title: Ultrafast Non-Hermitian Skin Effect
Authors: Barbara Schneider, Alexander Dikopoltsev, Markus Bestler, Philipp Täschler, Mattias Beck, David Burghoff, Oded Zilberberg, Jérome Faist
Abstract: Topological phases of matter commonly feature protected states at their boundaries. Transferring this protection to time-metamaterials is extremely challenging, as it requires the generation of an abrupt interface between two topologically distinct bulks. Here, we realize and measure an ultrafast topological non-Hermitian skin mode bound to an interface circulating within the cavity of a fast-gain semiconductor laser. The nonlinear stationary state generated in such devices features a jump in the instantaneous frequency. We show that this discontinuity gives rise to a topological interface for the field fluctuations in the system. Using direct intensity sampling, we experimentally measure the skin modes and their positioning at the frequency jump of the stationary state. Analysis of these isolated modes reveals an ultrashort full-width at half-maximum of 583 $\pm$ 16 fs. Furthermore, we show that we can tune the shape and relative timing shift of the skin modes via external bias modulation. Finally, both numerical and experimental analysis of the noise in the system reveal that field fluctuations are funneled into the topological interface. Our findings reveal a new way to generate topologically protected states of light in time, which paves the way for novel time-varying physics as well as metrological applications.

Title: The response of a quantum system to a collision: an autonomous derivation of Kubo's formula
Authors: Samuel L. Jacob, John Goold
Abstract: We study the response of a quantum system induced by a collision with a quantum particle, using the time-independent framework of scattering theory. After deriving the dynamical map for the quantum system, we show that the unitary contribution to the dynamics defines a non-perturbative response function obeying a general fluctuation-dissipation relation. We show that Kubo's formula emerges autonomously in the Born approximation, where the time-dependent perturbation is determined by particle's evolution through the potential region.

Abstract: We consider ensembles of pure Gaussian states parametrized by single-mode marginals and (optionally) specific mode-mode correlations. Such ensembles provide a model for the final states when isolated quantum systems thermalize, as they can reproduce thermal properties locally, while being globally pure. By an analysis using real replicas and the coherent state representation of Gaussian states we show that the average entanglement entropy of a small subsystem is the same as the von Neumann entropy of a mixed Gaussian state with the same marginals, but no correlations. Finally, we discuss how these ensembles provide a model for Hawking radiation assuming unitary evolution, and discuss some of their properties in relations to the Page curve of Hawking radiation.

Title: Incremental universality of Wigner random matrices
Authors: Giovanni M. Cicuta, Mario Pernici
Abstract: Properties of universality have essential relevance for the theory of random matrices usually called the Wigner ensemble. The issue was analysed up to recent years with detailed and relevant results. We present a slightly different view and compare the large-$n$ limit of connected correlators of distinct ensembles: universality has steps or degrees, precisely counted by the number of probability moments of the matrix entries, which match among distinct ensembles.

Title: Projection Optimization Method for Open-Dissipative Quantum Fluids and its Application to a Single Vortex in a Photon Bose-Einstein Condensate
Authors: Joshua Krauß, Marcos Alberto Gonçalves dos Santos Filho, Francisco Ednilson Alves dos Santos, Axel Pelster
Abstract: Open dissipative systems of quantum fluids have been well studied numerically. In view of a complementary analytical description we extend here the variational optimization method for Bose-Einstein condensates of closed systems to open-dissipative condensates. The resulting projection optimization method is applied to a complex Gross-Pitaevski equation, which models phenomenologically a photon Bose-Einstein condensate. Together with known methods from hydrodynamics we obtain an approximate vortex solution, which depends on the respective open system parameters and has the same properties as obtained numerically in the literature.

Title: Altermagnetism from coincident Van Hove singularities: application to $κ$-Cl
Authors: Yue Yu, Han-Gyeol Suh, Mercè Roig, Daniel F. Agterberg
Abstract: Realizing two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets is important for spintronics applications. Here we propose a microscopic template for stabilizing 2D altermagnetism through Van Hove singularities that are coincident in both energy and momentum. These coincident Van Hove singularities are a generic consequence of non-symmorphic symmetries in nine 2D space groups. Due to nontrivial symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian, these coincident Van Hove singularities allow new hopping interactions between the Van Hove singularities that do not appear in analogous Van Hove singularity based patch models for cuprates and graphene. We show these new interactions can give rise to various weak coupling, and BCS-based instabilities, including altermagnetism, nematicity, inter-band d-wave superconductivity, and orbital altermagnetic order. We apply our results to quasi-2D organic $\kappa$-Cl in which altermagnetism is known to appear.

Title: Multiphysics Modeling of Surface Diffusion Coupled with Large Deformation in 3D Solids
Authors: Jaemin Kim, Keon Ho Kim, Nikolaos Bouklas
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and computational model that explores the behavior of a thin hydrated film bonded to a non-hydrated / impermeable soft substrate in the context of surface and bulk elasticity coupled with surface diffusion kinetics. This type of coupling can manifests as an integral aspect in diverse engineering processes encountered in optical interference coatings, tissue engineering, soft electronics, and can prove important in design process for the next generation of sensors and actuators, especially as the focus is shifted to systems in smaller lengthscales. The intricate interplay between solvent diffusion and deformation of the film is governed by surface poroelasticity, and the viscoelastic deformation of the substrate. While existing methodologies offer tools for studying coupled poroelasticity involving solvent diffusion and network deformation, there exists a gap in understanding how coupled poroelastic processes occurring in a film attached to the boundary of a highly deformable solid can influence its response. In this study, we introduce a non-equilibrium thermodynamics formulation encompassing the multiphysical processes of surface poroelasticity and bulk viscoelasticity, complemented by a corresponding finite element implementation. Our approach captures the complex dynamics between the finite deformation of the substrate and solvent diffusion on the surface. This work contributes valuable insights, particularly in scenarios where the coupling of surface diffusion kinetics and substrate elasticity is an important design factor.

Title: Pair density waves in the strong-coupling two-dimensional Holstein-Hubbard model: A variational Monte Carlo study
Authors: Jiucai Wang, Wen Sun, Hao-Xin Wang, Zhaoyu Han, Steven A. Kivelson, Hong Yao
Abstract: A robust theory of the mechanism of pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity (i.e. where Cooper pairs have nonzero center of mass momentum) remains elusive. Here we explore the triangular lattice $t$-$J$-$V$ model, a low-energy effective theory derived from the strong-coupling limit of the Holstein-Hubbard model, by large-scale variational Monte Carlo simulations. When the electron density is sufficiently low, the favored ground state is an s-wave PDW, consistent with results obtained from previous studies in this limit. Additionally, a PDW ground state with nematic d-wave pairing emerges in the intermediate range of electron densities and phonon frequencies. For these s-wave and d-wave PDWs arising in states with spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries, PDW formation derives from valley-polarization and intra-pocket pairing.

Title: Recoverable strain in amorphous materials: the role of ongoing plastic events following initial elastic recoil
Authors: Henry A. Lockwood, Suzanne M. Fielding
Abstract: Recoverable strain is the strain recovered once a stress is removed from a body, in the direction opposite to that in which the stress had acted. To date, the phenomenon has been understood as being elastic in origin: polymer chains stretched in the direction of an imposed stress will recoil after the stress is removed, for example. Any unrecoverable strain is instead attributed to irreversible plastic deformations. Here we study theoretically strain recovery within the soft glassy rheology model, aimed at describing the rheology of elastoplastic yield stress fluids and amorphous soft solids. We consider a material subject to the switch-on of a shear stress that is held constant before later being set back to zero, after which the strain recovery is observed. After an initially fast recoil that is indeed elastic in nature, significant further strain recovery then occurs more slowly via the plastic yielding of elements with negative local stresses, opposite to that of the original shear. We elucidate the mechanism that underlies this behaviour, in terms of the evolution of the SGR model's population of elastoplastic elements. In particular, we show that the initial fast elastic recoil brings to a state of negative local stress those elements that had yielded during the forward straining while the load was applied. The subsequent delayed plastic yielding of these elements with negative stress is the origin of the slow ongoing strain recovery. In this way, counterintuitively, elements that had yielded plastically while the load was applied still contribute significantly to strain recovery after the sample is unloaded. This finding has important consequences for constitutive modeling, because such behaviour can only arise in a constitutive model that evolves a full distribution of local stresses (or multiple moments of such a distribution), rather than a single average stress.

Title: Continuous Transition between Bosonic Fractional Chern Insulator and Superfluid
Authors: Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Bin-Bin Chen, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of the FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of the Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta M or $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF(M) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous, and the bipartite entanglement entropy at the critical point with the area-law scaling is consistent with the critical theories. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$ 0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$ 0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class within numerical uncertainty and possibly more exotic beyond-Landau ones. This letter thence presents a direct numerical demonstration of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topologically ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of the Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.

Title: Skyrmion-vortex hybrid and spin wave solutions in superconducting ferromagnets
Authors: Shantonu Mukherjee, Amitabha Lahiri
Abstract: The coexistence of Ferromagnetism and superconductivity in so called ferromagnetic superconductors is an intriguing phenomenon which may lead to novel physical effects as well as applications. Here in this work we have explored the interplay of topological excitations, namely vortices and skyrmions, in ferromagnetic superconductors using a field theoretic description of such systems. In particular, numerical solutions for the continuous spin field compatible to a given vortex profile are determined in absence and presence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) term. The solutions show that the spin configuration is like a skyrmion but intertwined with the vortex structure -- the radius of the the skyrmion-like solution depends on the penetration depth and also the polarity of the skyrmion depends on the sign of the winding number. Thus our solution describes a novel topological structure -- namely a skyrmion-vortex composite. We have also determined the spin wave solutions in such systems in presence and absence of a vortex. In absence of vortex frequency and wave vector satisfy a cubic equation which leads to various interesting features. In particular, we have shown that in the low frequency regime the minimum in dispersion relation shifts from $k=0$ to a non zero $k$ value depending on the parameters. We also discuss the nature of spin wave dispersion in the $\omega \sim \Tilde{m}$ regime which shows a similar pattern in the dispersion curve. The group velocity of the spin wave would change it's sign across such a minimum which is unique to FMSC. Also, the spin wave modes around the local minimum looks like roton mode in superfluid and hence called a magnetic roton. In presence of a vortex, the spin wave amplitude is shown to vary spatially such that the profile looks like that of a Néel Skyrmion. Possible experimental signature of both solutions are also discussed.

Title: Magnons from time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory and nonempirical Hubbard functionals
Authors: Luca Binci, Nicola Marzari, Iurii Timrov
Abstract: Spin excitations play a fundamental role in understanding magnetic properties of materials, and have significant technological implications for magnonic devices. However, accurately modeling these in transition-metal and rare-earth compounds remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present a fully first-principles approach for calculating spin-wave spectra based on time-dependent (TD) density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), using nonempirical Hubbard functionals. This approach is implemented in a general noncollinear formulation, enabling the study of magnons in both collinear and noncollinear magnetic systems. Unlike methods that rely on empirical Hubbard $U$ parameters to describe the ground state, and Heisenberg Hamiltonians for describing magnetic excitations, the methodology developed here probes directly the dynamical spin susceptibility (efficiently evaluated with TDDFPT throught the Liouville-Lanczos approach), and treats the linear variation of the Hubbard augmentation (in itself calculated non-empirically) in full at a self-consistent level. Furthermore, the method satisfies the Goldstone condition without requiring empirical rescaling of the exchange-correlation kernel or explicit enforcement of sum rules, in contrast to existing state-of-the-art techniques. We benchmark the novel computational scheme on prototypical transition-metal monoxides NiO and MnO, showing remarkable agreement with experiments and highlighting the fundamental role of these newly implemented Hubbard corrections. The method holds great promise for describing collective spin excitations in complex materials containing localized electronic states.

Title: Deriving the Forces of Nonequilibria from Two Laws
Authors: Ying-Jen Yang, Ken A. Dill
Abstract: Non-EQuilibrium (NEQ) statistical physics has not had the same general foundation as that of EQuilibrium (EQ) statistical physics, where forces are derived from potentials such as $1/T = \partial S/\partial U$, and from which other key mathematical relations follow. Here, we show how general NEQ principles can be derived from two corresponding laws. Maximizing path entropy replaces maximizing state entropy. Whereas EQ can entail observables $(U, V, N)$, dynamics has (node populations, edge traffic, cycle flux). We derive forces of NEQ, fluctuation-susceptibility equalities, Maxwell-Onsager-like symmetry relations, and we generalize to ``cost-benefit'' relations beyond just work and heat dissipation.

Title: Nonequilibrium Force-Flow Relations in Networks
Authors: Ying-Jen Yang, Ken A. Dill
Abstract: In a companion paper [arXiv:2410.09277], we outlined a general theory for nonequilibrium (NEQ) network statistical physics, $\textit{Caliber Force Theory}$, (CFT). It resembles the "First and Second Laws" basis of Equilibrium (EQ) Thermodynamics, except that dynamics requires maximization of $\textit{path entropy}$ ($\mathfrak{S}_\text{path}$), not $\textit{state entropy}$. Here, we elaborate the mathematics of the forces $(\text{d} \mathfrak{S}_\text{path}/\text{d}{\textbf{x}})$, the fluctuation-respond relations, and the Maxwell-Onsager-like symmetry relations. And we give applications beyond thermal baths -- such as networks in ecology, biochemistry, vehicle traffic, and other force-flow networks. Beyond past work on inequalities, it gives equalities; and it gives forces, which allows for studies of optimization, conflicts, congestion and network design; and it gives a third Kirchhoff-like relation that applies to networks that have fluctuating flows.

Title: Competing charge density wave phases in YNiC2
Authors: Marta Roman, Simone Di Cataldo, Berthold Stöger, Lisa Reisinger, Emilie Morineau, Kamil K. Kolincio, Herwig Michor
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) orders in YNiC2 are studied by means of combined experimental and computational techniques. On the experimental side, single crystals grown by the floating-zone method were examined by means of X-ray diffraction, as well as transport and thermal techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations founded on the experimentally determined parent and CDW-modified crystal structures provide details of electronic and phononic structures as well as electron-phonon coupling and resolve changes inflicted upon entering the different CDW phases. Thereby, contrasting effects of subsequently emerging CDW states characterized by incommensurate q_{1ic} and commensurate q_{2c} modulation vectors are revealed. The former state, on-setting below T_{1ic}~ 305 K, weakly modifies the electronic structure by opening an almost isotropic gap on a minor part of the Fermi surface (FS). The latter phase, which takes over below T_{2c}~ 272 K has a more pronounced impact on physical properties via a decomposition of larger parts of the FS. These dissimilar behaviors are directly reflected in the electronic transport anisotropy, which is significantly weakened in the q_{2c}-type CDW state. As revealed by our DFT studies, CDW phases are very close in energy and their origin is directly related to the anisotropy of electron-phonon coupling, which is linked to a specific orbital character of related FS sheets. Specific heat and thermal expansion studies reveal a nearly reversible first-order phase transition at around T_{2c}~ 272 K, where both CDW phases co-exist within a T-interval of about 10 K.

Title: Multifunctional 2d infrared photodetectors enabled by asymmetric singular metasurfaces
Authors: Valentin Semkin, Aleksandr Shabanov, Kirill Kapralov, Mikhail Kashchenko, Alexander Sobolev, Ilya Mazurenko, Vladislav Myltsev, Egor Nikulin, Alexander Chernov, Ekaterina Kameneva, Alexey Bocharov, Dmitry Svintsov
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials offering ultrafast photoresponse suffer from low intrinsic absorbance, especially in the mid-infrared wavelength range. Challenges in 2d material doping further complicate the creation of light-sensitive $p-n$ junctions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a graphene-based infrared detector with simultaneously enhanced absorption and strong structural asymmetry enabling zero-bias photocurrent. A key element for those properties is an asymmetric singular metasurface (ASMS) atop graphene with keen metal wedges providing singular enhancement of local absorbance. The ASMS geometry predefines extra device functionalities. The structures with connected metallic wedges demonstrate polarization ratios up to 200 in a broad range of carrier densities at a wavelength of 8.6 $\mu$m. The structures with isolated wedges display gate-controlled switching between polarization-discerning and polarization-stable photoresponse, a highly desirable yet scarce property for polarized imaging.

Title: Integrable fishnet circuits and Brownian solitons
Authors: Žiga Krajnik, Enej Ilievski, Tomaž Prosen, Benjamin J. A. Héry, Vincent Pasquier
Abstract: We introduce classical many-body dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice comprising local two-body maps arranged on discrete space-time mesh that serve as discretizations of Hamiltonian dynamics with arbitrarily time-varying coupling constants. Time evolution is generated by passing an auxiliary degree of freedom along the lattice, resulting in a `fishnet' circuit structure. We construct integrable circuits consisting of Yang-Baxter maps and demonstrate their general properties, using the Toda and anisotropic Landau-Lifschitz models as examples. Upon stochastically rescaling time, the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations and we observe solitons undergoing Brownian motion.

Title: Modular Autonomous Virtualization System for Two-Dimensional Semiconductor Quantum Dot Arrays
Authors: Anantha S. Rao, Donovan Buterakos, Barnaby van Straaten, Valentin John, Cécile X. Yu, Stefan D. Oosterhout, Lucas Stehouwer, Giordano Scappucci, Menno Veldhorst, Francesco Borsoi, Justyna P. Zwolak
Abstract: Arrays of gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots are among the leading candidates for building scalable quantum processors. High-fidelity initialization, control, and readout of spin qubit registers require exquisite and targeted control over key Hamiltonian parameters that define the electrostatic environment. However, due to the tight gate pitch, capacitive crosstalk between gates hinders independent tuning of chemical potentials and interdot couplings. While virtual gates offer a practical solution, determining all the required cross-capacitance matrices accurately and efficiently in large quantum dot registers is an open challenge. Here, we establish a modular automated virtualization system (MAViS) -- a general and modular framework for autonomously constructing a complete stack of multilayer virtual gates in real time. Our method employs machine learning techniques to rapidly extract features from two-dimensional charge stability diagrams. We then utilize computer vision and regression models to self-consistently determine all relative capacitive couplings necessary for virtualizing plunger and barrier gates in both low- and high-tunnel-coupling regimes. Using MAViS, we successfully demonstrate accurate virtualization of a dense two-dimensional array comprising ten quantum dots defined in a high-quality Ge/SiGe heterostructure. Our work offers an elegant and practical solution for the efficient control of large-scale semiconductor quantum dot systems.

Title: Why Grain Growth is Not Curvature Flow
Authors: Caihao Qiu, David J. Srolovitz, Gregory S. Rohrer, Jian Han, Marco Salvalaglio
Abstract: Grain growth in polycrystals is traditionally considered a capillarity-driven process, where grain boundaries (GBs) migrate toward their centers of curvature (i.e., mean curvature flow) with a velocity proportional to the local curvature (including extensions to account for anisotropic GB energy and mobility). Experimental and simulation evidence shows that this simplistic view is untrue. We demonstrate that the failure of the classical mean curvature flow description of grain growth mainly originates from the shear deformation naturally coupled with GB motion (i.e., shear coupling). Our findings are built on large-scale microstructure evolution simulations incorporating the fundamental (crystallography-respecting) microscopic mechanism of GB migration. The nature of the deviations from curvature flow revealed in our simulations is consistent with observations in recent experimental studies on different materials. This work also demonstrates how to incorporate the mechanical effects that are essential to the accurate prediction of microstructure evolution.

Title: Accuracy of time-dependent GGE under weak dissipation
Authors: Luca Lumia, Gianni Aupetit-Diallo, Jérôme Dubail, Mario Collura
Abstract: Unitary integrable models typically relax to a stationary Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), but in experimental realizations dissipation often breaks integrability. In this work, we use the recently introduced time-dependent GGE (t-GGE) approach to describe the open dynamics of a gas of bosons subject to atom losses and gains. We employ tensor network methods to provide numerical evidence of the exactness of the t-GGE in the limit of adiabatic dissipation, and of its accuracy in the regime of weak but finite dissipation. That accuracy is tested for two-point functions via the rapidity distribution, and for more complicated correlations through a non-Gaussianity measure. We combine this description with Generalized Hydrodynamics and we show that it correctly captures transport at the Euler scale. Our results demonstrate that the t-GGE approach is robust in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous settings.

Title: Copper delocalization leads to ultralow thermal conductivity in chalcohalide CuBiSeCl2
Authors: Yuzhou Hao, Junwei Che, Xiaoying Wang, Xuejie Li, Jun Sun, Xiangdong Ding, Turab Lookman, Zhibin Gao
Abstract: Mixed anion halide-chalcogenide materials have attracted considerable attention due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, making them promising candidates for various applications. Among these, CuBiSeCl_2 has recently been experimentally identified with remarkably low lattice thermal conductivity (k_L). In this study, we employ Wigner transport theory combined with neuroevolution machine learning potential (NEP)-assisted self-consistent phonon calculations to unravel the microscopic origins of this low k_L. Our findings reveal that the delocalization and weak bonding of copper atoms are key contributors to the strong phonon anharmonicity and wavelike tunneling (random walk diffusons). These insights deepen our understanding of the relationship between bonding characteristics, anharmonicity, delocalization, and vibrational dynamics, paving the way for the design and optimization of CuBiSeCl_2 and analogous materials for advanced phonon engineering applications.

Title: In-poor IGZO: superior resilience to hydrogen in forming gas anneal and PBTI
Authors: A. Kruv, M. J. van Setten, A. Chasin, D. Matsubayashi, H. F. W. Dekkers, A. Pavel, Y. Wan, K. Trivedi, N. Rassoul, J. Li, Y. Jiang, S. Subhechha, G. Pourtois, A. Belmonte, G. Sankar Kar
Abstract: Integrating In-Ga-Zn-oxide (IGZO) channel transistors in silicon-based ecosystems requires the resilience of the channel material to hydrogen treatment. Standard IGZO, containing 40% In (metal ratio) suffers from degradation under forming gas anneal (FGA) and hydrogen (H) driven positive bias temperature instability (PBTI). We demonstrate scaled top-gated ALD transistors with an In-poor (In $\le$ 17%) IGZO channel that show superior resilience to hydrogen compared to the In-rich (In=40%) counterpart. The devices, fabricated with a 300-mm FAB process with dimensions down to $W_\mathrm{CH} \times L_\mathrm{TG} = 80 \times 40 \mathrm{nm}^2$, show excellent stability in 2-hour 420$^\circ$C forming gas anneal ($0.06 \le \left| \Delta V_{\mathrm{TH}} \right| \le 0.33\mathrm{V}$) and improved resilience to H in PBTI at 125$^\circ$C (down to no detectable H-induced $V_{\mathrm{TH}}$ shift) compared to In-rich devices. We demonstrate that the device degradation by H in the FGA is different from the H-induced VTH instability in PBTI, namely oxygen scavenging by H and H release from a gate-dielectric into the channel, respectively, and that resilience to H in one process does not automatically translate to resilience to H in the other one. This significant improvement in IGZO resilience to H enables the use of FGA treatments during fabrication needed for silicon technology compatibility, as well as further scaling and 3D integration, bringing IGZO-based technologies closer to mass production.

Title: Néel vector-dependent anomalous transport in altermagnetic metal CrSb
Authors: Tianye Yu, Ijaz Shahid, Peitao Liu, Xing-Qiu Chen, Yan Sun
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a recently proposed class of collinear magnetism that combines the characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite the promising potential of altermagnetic materials for realizing these unique transport properties, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, using first-principles calculations. Our findings indicate that CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, allowing for the manipulation of the Néel vector through an external electric field. We explored the anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities as functions of the Néel vector orientation, finding that both effects reach their maximum when the Néel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution in the Brillouin zone. Our results illustrate the Néel vector-dependent anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in an altermagnetic metal, offering an additional metallic altermagnetic platform to investigate anomalous transport properties, thereby complementing the widely studied RuO$_2$.

Title: Mathematical analysis of a flux-jump model in superconductivity
Authors: Jean-Guy Caputo, Nathan Rouxelin
Abstract: Type II superconductors can trap a transient magnetic field and become "cryomagnets" that are very useful for applications. During this process, flux jumps i.e. sudden jumps of the total magnetization occur and hinder the properties of these magnets. To understand the electrodynamics of these systems and in particular flux jumps, we analyzed mathematically a model based on Maxwell's equations and temperature in a 1D configuration. When a magnetic pulse is applied to a superconductor, three effects occur, from fastest to slowest: Joule heating, magnetic relaxation and temperature diffusion. Adimensionalising the problem, we obtain a nonlinear diffusion for the magnetic field coupled to a forced diffusion equation for the temperature with only two parameters. Two regimes occur, depending on temperature: for medium temperature the heat capacity of a sample can be assumed constant while for low temperature it depends on temperature causing a nonlinear temperature evolution. Flux jumps can be explained using the fixed points of the equations. We found that they occur for pulses of duration close to the magnetic relaxation time and mostly at low temperature because of the nonlinear dependance. Flux trapping is maximal for medium amplitude long duration pulses and low to medium temperatures, so these conditions are optimal to produce better cryomagnets.

Title: Controlled polymorphic competition -- a path to tough and hard ceramics
Authors: D.G. Sangiovanni, A. Kjellén, F. Trybel, L.J.S. Johnson, M. Odén, F. Tasnádi, I.A. Abrikosov
Abstract: From nanoscale devices including sensors, electronics, or biocompatible coatings to macroscale structural, automotive or aerospace components, fundamental understanding of plasticity and fracture can guide the realization of materials that ensure safe and durable performance. Identifying the role of atomic-scale plasticity is crucial, especially for applications relying on brittle ceramics. Here, stress-intensity-controlled atomistic simulations of fracture in cubic Ti$_{1-x}$Al$_{x}$N model systems demonstrate how $\overset{\lower.5em\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$-scale plasticity - manifested as lattice distortions, phase transformation, nucleation and emission of dislocations - substantially affects the macroscale fracture toughness (K$_{Ic}$) and fracture strength (${\sigma}$$_{f}$) of brittle ceramics. The extent of plastic deformation in Ti$_{1-x}$Al$_{x}$N increases monotonically with the Al content (x), due to a corresponding decrease in cubic $\rightarrow$ hexagonal polymorph transition energies and unstable stacking fault energies. Overall, plasticity positively affects the mechanical properties, resulting in optimal combinations of strength and toughness for x~0.6. However, for x exceeding ~0.7, the benefits of plasticity diminish. The initial rise followed by a decline in K$_{Ic}$(x) and ${\sigma}$$_{f}$(x) is explained based on the interplay between phase transformation, shear-induced faulting, and tensile cleavage on the easiest fracture plane. The results highlight the impact of atomic-scale plasticity on observable properties and point to strategies for toughening ceramics through control of polymorph competition.

Title: Reduced Wannier representation for topological bands
Authors: Trey Cole, David Vanderbilt
Abstract: Bands with non-trivial topological indices have a topological obstruction preventing them from being represented by exponentially localized Wannier states. Here, we propose a procedure to construct exponentially localized Wannier functions that span a subspace of topologically obstructed bands through the use of the projection method. These Wannier functions form what we refer to as a "reduced Wannier representation," indicating that the Wannier functions necessarily do not span the full topological manifold. By constructing supercells, we obtain reduced Wannier functions that break the primitive translational symmetry while capturing a substantial portion of the topologically obstructed manifold. This approach effectively decomposes the topological manifold into two subspaces: an itinerant subspace inheriting the topology and a localized trivial subspace represented by reduced Wannier functions. We consider the Haldane and Kane-Mele tight-binding models as the platforms for our investigation.

Title: Universality in the microwave shielding of ultracold polar molecules
Authors: Joy Dutta, Bijit Mukherjee, Jeremy M. Hutson
Abstract: Microwave shielding is an important technique that can suppress the losses that arise from collisions of ultracold polar molecules. It has been instrumental in achieving molecular Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) for NaCs [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. We demonstrate that microwave shielding is universal, in the sense that the 2-body collision properties of different molecules are very similar when expressed in suitable reduced units of length and energy. This applies to rate coefficients for inelastic scattering and loss, to scattering lengths, and to the properties of 2-molecule bound states. We also explore the small deviations from universality that arise at very large Rabi frequencies. In general, the collision properties are near-universal except when the Rabi frequency exceeds a few percent of the molecular rotational constant. The universality extends to elliptically polarized microwaves and to combinations of multiple fields. Our results indicate that the methods that have been used to achieve BEC for NaCs can be transferred directly to most other polar molecules.

Title: Deterministic and Scalable Quantum Light Generation in DNA Origami-Programmed Organic Molecule-MoS$_2$ Monolayer Hybrids
Authors: Shen Zhao, Zhijie Li, Elisabeth Erber, Anna Altunina, Christoph Sikeler, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Anvar S. Baimuratov, Tim Liedl, Alexander Högele, Irina V. Martynenko
Abstract: The functionalization of atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with organic molecules is a promising approach for realizing nanoscale optoelectronic devices with tailored functionalities, such as quantum light generation or p-n junctions. However, achieving precise control over the molecules' positioning on the 2D material remains a significant challenge. Here, we overcome the limitations of solution- and vapor-deposition methods and use a DNA origami placement technique to spatially arrange thiol molecules on a chip surface at the single-molecule level with high assembly yields. We successfully integrated MoS$_2$ monolayers with micron-scale thiol-origami patterns, achieving single-photon emission from thiol-induced localized excitons in MoS$_2$. Our work lays a foundation for the chemical control of quantum emitters in atomically-thin semiconductors and enables the design and production of ultracompact 2D devices for quantum technologies.

Title: Deep Neural Network for Phonon-Assisted Optical Spectra in Semiconductors
Authors: Qiangqiang Gu, Shishir Kumar Pandey, Zhanghao Zhouyin
Abstract: Ab initio based accurate simulation of phonon-assisted optical spectra of semiconductors at finite temperatures remains a formidable challenge, as it requires large supercells for phonon sampling and computationally expensive high-accuracy exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. In this work, we present an efficient approach that combines deep learning tight-binding and potential models to address this challenge with ab initio fidelity. By leveraging molecular dynamics for atomic configuration sampling and deep learning-enabled rapid Hamiltonian evaluation, our approach enables large-scale simulations of temperature-dependent optical properties using advanced XC functionals (HSE, SCAN). Demonstrated on silicon and gallium arsenide across temperature 100-400 K, the method accurately captures phonon-induced bandgap renormalization and indirect/direct absorption processes which are in excellent agreement with experimental findings over five orders of magnitude. This work establishes a pathway for high-throughput investigation of electron-phonon coupled phenomena in complex materials, overcoming traditional computational limitations arising from large supercell used with computationally expensive XC-functionals.

Title: Benchmarking a magnon-scattering reservoir with modal and temporal multiplexing
Authors: Christopher Heins, Joo-Von Kim, Lukas Körber, Jürgen Fassbender, Helmut Schultheiss, Katrin Schultheiss
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing has emerged as a powerful framework for exploiting the inherent nonlinear dynamics of physical systems to perform computational tasks. Recently, we presented the magnon-scattering reservoir, whose internal nodes are given by the fundamental wave-like excitations of ferromagnets called magnons. These excitations can be geometrically-quantized and, in response to an external stimulus, show transient nonlinear scattering dynamics that can be harnessed to perform memory and nonlinear transformation tasks. Here, we test a magnon-scattering reservoir in a single magnetic disk in the vortex state towards two key performance indicators for physical reservoir computing, the short-term memory and parity-check tasks. Using time-resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy, we measure the evolution of the reservoir's spectral response to an input sequence consisting of random binary inputs encoded in microwave pulses with two distinct frequencies. Two different output spaces of the reservoir are defined, one based on the time-averaged frequency spectra and another based on temporal multiplexing. Our results demonstrate that the memory and nonlinear transformation capability do not depend on the chosen read-out scheme as long as the dimension of the output space is large enough to capture all nonlinear features provided by the magnon-magnon interactions. This further shows that solely the nonlinear magnons in the physical system, not the read-out, determine the reservoir's capacity.

Title: Antiferromagnetic diamond network as an efficient spin filter: Proposition of a spin-specific semi-conducting behavior
Authors: Debjani Das Gupta, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: We propose, for the first time, that an array of diamond plaquettes, each possessing vanishing net magnetization, can achieve complete spin polarization over a broad bias window. Furthermore, this system can be utilized to realize spin-specific semiconducting behavior. We describe the antiferromagnetic diamond network within a tight-binding framework, where spin-dependent scattering arises due to the interaction between itinerant electrons and local magnetic moments at different lattice sites. The mechanism underlying spin filtration relies on the specific arrangement of magnetic moments within individual plaquettes. We systematically investigate the spin polarization phenomenon under various input conditions, examining its dependence on network size, system temperature, and the magnetic flux threading each plaquette. Due to the network's geometry, we identify a sharply localized, highly degenerate energy level coexisting with conducting states. By tuning physical parameters, a small energy gap can be established between these degenerate localized states and the conducting energy band, enabling spin-specific $p$-type and $n$-type semiconducting behavior. Our findings offer a novel approach for designing future spintronic devices based on similar antiferromagnetic networks.

Title: Observation of a zero-energy excitation mode in the open Dicke model
Authors: Anton Bolian, Phatthamon Kongkhambut, Christoph Georges, Roy D. Jara Jr., José Vargas, Jens Klinder, Jayson G. Cosme, Hans Keßler, Andreas Hemmerich
Abstract: Approaching phase boundaries in many-body systems can give rise to intriguing signatures in their excitation spectra. Here, we explore the excitation spectrum of a Bose-Einstein condensate strongly coupled to an optical cavity and pumped by an optical standing wave, which simulates the famous Dicke-Hepp-Lieb phase transition of the open Dicke model with dissipation arising due to photon leakage from the cavity. For weak dissipation, the excitation spectrum displays two strongly polaritonic modes. Close to the phase boundary, we observe an intriguing regime where the lower-energetic of these modes, instead of showing the expected roton-type mode softening, is found to approach and persist at zero energy, well before the critical pump strength for the Dicke-Hepp-Lieb transition boundary is reached. Hence, a peculiar situation arises, where an excitation is possible at zero energy cost, but nevertheless no instability of the system is created.

Title: Structural and mechanical characterisation of nylon fibre aggregates
Authors: L. Gey, R. Guenin, P. Le Gal, G. Verhille
Abstract: The study of fibre networks is of great importance due to their appearance in a wide range of natural and industrial processes. These networks are particularly complex because their properties depend not only on the characteristics of individual fibres but also on their collective arrangements within the network. In this study, we investigate the case of nylon fibre aggregates that were generated in a turbulent von Karman flow. The key properties of these aggregates are characterized, including their three-dimensional structures, analysed through X-ray tomography, and their mechanical responses. The results are compared with those observed for aegagropilae, a natural fibre aggregate commonly found on the Mediterranean sea shore

Title: Colossal Dielectric Response and Electric Polarization in Lithium Nitrate
Authors: Na Du, Yan Zhao, Enting Xu, Jianwei Han, Peng Ren, Fei Yen
Abstract: Lithium nitrate LiNO$_3$ is identified to possess a dielectric constant $\epsilon$' larger than 6x10$^6$ at 1 kHz in powder samples above the critical temperature $T$$_W$ = 306 K. For single crystalline samples, $\epsilon$' can be sustained to remain above 10$^5$ and the dissipation factor below 10 in the temperature region of 280-340 K after a simple 'activation' process. Moreover, pyroelectric current measurements show LiNO$_3$ to be ferroelectric with an electric polarization of $P$ = 1,200 $\mu$C/cm$^2$. Both $\epsilon$' and $P$ are amongst one of the highest in all known materials. We propose a model suggesting the mechanism underlying the colossal magnitudes of $\epsilon$' and $P$ to stem from a gearing-ungearing process of the planar NO$_3$$^-$ at the macroscopic level. Our results potentially push the boundaries of ceramic capacitors.

Title: Role of seed layer in growing atomically flat TiTe2/Sb2Te3 heterostructure thin films at the wafer scale
Authors: Chao Nie, Xueyang Shen, Junying Zhang, Chenyu Wen, Yuxin Du, Yazhi Xu, Riccardo Mazzarello, En Ma, Xiaozhe Wang, Wei Zhang, Jiang-Jing Wang
Abstract: Chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) are a leading candidate for advanced memory and computing applications. Epitaxial-like growth of chalcogenide thin films at the wafer scale is important to guarantee the homogeneity of the thin film but is challenging with magnetron sputtering, particularly for the growth of phase-change heterostructure (PCH), such as TiTe2/Sb2Te3. In this work, we report how to obtain highly textured TiTe2/Sb2Te3 heterostructure thin films with atomically sharp interfaces on standard silicon substrates. By combining atomic-scale characterization and ab initio simulations, we reveal the critical role of the Sb2Te3 seed layer in forming a continuous Si-Sb-Te mixed transition layer, which provides a wafer-scale flat surface for the subsequent epitaxial-like growth of TiTe2/Sb2Te3 thin film. By gradually reducing the thickness of the seed layer, we determine its critical limit to be ~2 nm. Non-negligible in-plane tensile strain was observed in the TiTe2 slabs due to the lattice mismatch with the adjacent Sb2Te3 ones, suggesting that the chemical interaction across the structural gaps in the heterostructure is stronger than a pure van der Waals interaction. Finally, we outline the potential choices of chalcogenides for atomically flat seed layers on standard silicon substrates, which can be used for wafer-scale synthesis of other high-quality PCM or PCH thin films.

Title: Majorana polarization in disordered heterostructures
Authors: Shubhanshu Karoliya, Sumanta Tewari, Gargee Sharma
Abstract: Recent studies propose Majorana polarization (MP) as a tool for identifying topological Majorana bound states (MBS). We analyze MP in two systems: a one-dimensional (1d) semiconducting nanowire and a quasi-1d system, both with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, proximity-induced superconductivity, and disorder. While MP reflects topological features, it does not always distinguish true MBS from partially separated Andreev bound states (psABS) or quasi-Majorana modes. True MBS are expected to satisfy $\mathcal{P}^*_\mathrm{left} \cdot \mathcal{P}_\mathrm{right} \sim -1$, but two additional criteria - a topological bandgap and edge-localized wavefunctions - are also necessary for their identification and use in topological quantum computation (TQC). We highlight cases where the polarization product condition holds without meeting these extra requirements. Our conclusions remain robust irrespective of the chosen definition of Majorana polarization, whether based on chiral or the particle-hole framework. Robust MBS identification for TQC demands combining MP with energy spectra and wavefunction localization, especially in disordered systems.

Title: Lessons from the trenches on evaluating machine-learning systems in materials science
Authors: Nawaf Alampara, Mara Schilling-Wilhelmi, Kevin Maik Jablonka
Abstract: Measurements are fundamental to knowledge creation in science, enabling consistent sharing of findings and serving as the foundation for scientific discovery. As machine learning systems increasingly transform scientific fields, the question of how to effectively evaluate these systems becomes crucial for ensuring reliable progress. In this review, we examine the current state and future directions of evaluation frameworks for machine learning in science. We organize the review around a broadly applicable framework for evaluating machine learning systems through the lens of statistical measurement theory, using materials science as our primary context for examples and case studies. We identify key challenges common across machine learning evaluation such as construct validity, data quality issues, metric design limitations, and benchmark maintenance problems that can lead to phantom progress when evaluation frameworks fail to capture real-world performance needs. By examining both traditional benchmarks and emerging evaluation approaches, we demonstrate how evaluation choices fundamentally shape not only our measurements but also research priorities and scientific progress. These findings reveal the critical need for transparency in evaluation design and reporting, leading us to propose evaluation cards as a structured approach to documenting measurement choices and limitations. Our work highlights the importance of developing a more diverse toolbox of evaluation techniques for machine learning in materials science, while offering insights that can inform evaluation practices in other scientific domains where similar challenges exist.

Title: Damped photonic modes in helical graphene
Authors: Abdullah Guvendi, Omar Mustafa, Abdulkerim Karabulut
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of spin-1 vector bosons in helical spacetime, focusing on photonic modes in helical graphene structures. We model the helical graphene surface as a smooth, continuous, and distortion-free manifold, effectively adopting the continuum approximation. By solving the fully covariant vector boson equation, we derive exact solutions that describe the quantum states of photons in a curved helical background, revealing their energy spectra, mode profiles, and decay dynamics. We find that the decay times of damped photonic modes range from \(10^{-16}\) to \(10^{-13}\) seconds as the helical pitch (\(a\)) varies from \(10^3\) nanometers to \(1\) nanometer, indicating that the structure efficiently absorbs all photonic modes. Additionally, the probability density functions exhibit time dependence, complementing their spatial variation. These findings provide a foundation for the design of ultrafast graphene photodetectors, graphene photodevices for high-speed optical communications, advanced photonic devices, and quantum materials based on helical graphene for various nanophotonic applications.

Title: $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$: An $\textit{ab-initio}$ python 3 code to calculate Berry Curvature dependent Anomalous Hall Conductivity in any material
Authors: Vivek Pandey, Sudhir K. Pandey
Abstract: The anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in materials has long been a topic of debate. Studies reveal that AHC originates from the Berry curvature ($\boldsymbol\Omega$) of Bloch states. Accurate computation of AHC is crucial for predicting material properties and guiding experimental studies in topological and spintronic applications. Traditional approaches often rely on wannier interpolation, which can introduce inaccuracies and computational overhead. Also, reliability of the wannierization technique becomes questionable when the bands are highly entangled and dispersive. This demands the calculation of AHC using the $\textit{first-principle}$ approach. Here, we present $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$, a Python 3 based code that directly computes $\boldsymbol\Omega$ and AHC using WIEN2k output. Since, WIEN2k employs an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method, $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$ provides highly accurate AHC results. The code efficiently handles large $\textbf{k}$-grids by parallelizing $\boldsymbol\Omega$ computations over $\textbf{k}$-points. Also, it stores band-resolved $\boldsymbol\Omega$ in a binary file, thereby greatly reducing the required storage memory and allowing fast post-processing to compute AHC. $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$ has been validated on well-known materials exhibiting AHC. These include- Fe, Fe$_3$Ge & Co$_2$FeAl. At 300 K, the calculated magnitude of $\sigma_{xy}$ for Fe & Fe$_3$Ge is found to be 744 $S/cm$ & 311 $S/cm$, respectively. For Co$_2$FeAl, the magnitude of $\sigma_{xy}$ is obtained to be $\sim$56 $S/cm$ and is found to be constant with the change in temperature from 0-300 K. These results are in good agreement with previously reported theoretical and experimental data. This ensures the accuracy, reliability and efficiency of the code. The code is also provided with a post-processing tool to visualize $\boldsymbol\Omega$.

Title: Twist-Induced Effects on Weyl Pairs in Magnetized Graphene Nanoribbons
Authors: Semra Gurtas Dogan, Kobra Hasanirokh, Omar Mustafa, Abdullah Guvendi
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical investigation into the dynamics of Weyl pairs within magnetized helicoidal graphene nanoribbons. By embedding a curved surface into flat Minkowski space-time, we derive a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation specific to this system. We begin by formulating a non-perturbative wave equation that governs the relative motion of the Weyl pairs and obtain exact solutions. Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.

Title: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice
Authors: Bastián Pradenas, Grigor Adamyan, Oleg Tchernyshyov
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of an overlooked symmetry structure in non-collinear antiferromagnets that gives rise to an emergent quantum number for magnons. Focusing on the triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we show that its spin order parameter transforms under an enlarged symmetry group, $\mathrm{SO(3)_L \times SO(2)_R}$, rather than the conventional spin-rotation group $\mathrm{SO(3)}$. Although this larger symmetry is spontaneously broken by the ground state, a residual subgroup survives, leading to conserved Noether charges that, upon quantization, endow magnons with an additional quantum number -- \emph{isospin} -- beyond their energy and momentum. Our results provide a comprehensive framework for understanding symmetry, degeneracy, and quantum numbers in non-collinear magnetic systems, and bridge an unexpected connection between the paradigms of symmetry breaking in non-collinear antiferromagnets and chiral symmetry breaking in particle physics.

Title: Textured growth and electrical characterization of Zinc Sulfide on back-end-of-the-line (BEOL) compatible substrates
Authors: Claire Wu, Mythili Surendran, Anika Tabassum Priyoti, Gokul Anilkumar, Cheng-Hsien Wu, Chun-Chen Wang, Cheng-Chen Kuo, Harish Kumarasubramanian, Kenta Lin, Amari Butler, Rehan Kapadia, Xinyu Bao, Jayakanth Ravichandran
Abstract: Scaling of transistors has enabled continuous improvements in logic device performance, especially through materials engineering. However, surpassing horizontal limitations in chip manufacturing requires a vertical, third dimension. Three-dimensional integration of high-performance logic demands solving the challenge of low-temperature (less than 450°C) synthesis of high-mobility n-type and p-type semiconductor thin films for back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible transistors. Metal oxides, particularly indium oxides alloyed with gallium and tungsten, are promising n-type channel materials, but suitable p-type materials for BEOL remain scarce. Zinc sulfide (ZnS), a wide band-gap semiconductor, shows room-temperature p-type conductivity when doped with copper and crystallizes below 400°C. Here, we report growth of crystalline ZnS thin films by pulsed laser deposition on amorphous and polycrystalline surfaces including silicon nitride, thermal silicon dioxide, yttrium oxide, hafnium dioxide, sapphire, platinum, and titanium nitride. X-ray diffraction reveals out-of-plane texturing across all surfaces, while grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering probes in-plane crystalline quality. Surface and interface properties are assessed using X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy. Electrical characterization via J-V measurements (ZnS on Pt) and metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (ZnS on silicon dioxide) measurements show low leakage current ($10^{-5} A/cm^2$ at 0.40 MV/cm) and bilayer capacitor behavior, suggesting ZnS is highly intrinsic with minimal electrically active defects. Further work on doping ZnS with copper or other p-type elements is needed to realize ZnS as a dopable wide band-gap semiconductor for BEOL integration. This work demonstrates a novel thin-film growth method for sulfide semiconductors under BEOL-compatible conditions.

Title: Emergent superconductivity and non-reciprocal transport in a van der Waals Dirac semimetal/antiferromagnet heterostructure
Authors: Saurav Islam, Max Stanley, Anthony Richardella, Seungjun Lee, Kalana D. Halanayake, Sandra Santhosh, Danielle Reifsnyder Hickey, Tony Low, Nitin Samarth
Abstract: We investigate emergent superconductivity and non-reciprocal transport (magnetochiral anisotropy, superconducting diode effect) at the heterointerface of two non-superconducting van der Waals (vdW) materials, the Dirac semimetal ZrTe$_2$ and the antiferromagnetic iron chalcogenide FeTe, grown using molecular beam epitaxy. We show from electrical transport measurements that two dimensional (2D) superconductivity arises at the heterointerface below temperature $T \sim 12$~K. When capped with a 2D ferromagnet (CrTe$_2$), these heterostructures show a superconducting diode effect with efficiency of about 30\%. With strong spin-orbit coupling in ZrTe$_2$, these epitaxial heterostructures provide an attractive epitaxial vdW platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity in Dirac semimetals and for developing non-reciprocal devices for superconducting electronics.

Title: Effect of interatomic repulsion on a Kitaev-transmon qubit based on double quantum dots
Authors: Clara Palacios, Armando A. Aligia
Abstract: We investigate the effect of interatomic Coulomb repulsion $V$ on the Kitaev-transmon system proposed by Pino \textit{et al.} \cite{pino} which consists of a Josephson junction between two double quantum dots (DQDs) modeled by the spinless Kitaev Hamiltonian. For an isolated DQD, we demonstrate that a "sweet spot" hosting "poor man's Majorana" states can still be achieved in the presence of $V$ by appropriately tuning the system parameters. This adjustment allows the extension of previous results to the case of finite Coulomb repulsion $V \neq 0$. However, we observe modifications in the microwave spectrum, due to the presence of previously overlooked states. Additionally, we find that at the sweet spot of both DQDs, all eigenstates of the transmon system exhibit exact double degeneracy.

Title: Electrons as intermediate charge carriers in ion transport through nanoscale channels
Authors: Baptiste Coquinot, Mathieu Lizée, Lydéric Bocquet, Nikita Kavokine
Abstract: The ionic conductivity of a nanofluidic channel is one of its most basic properties, which is systematically characterized in experiments. While most studies to date have focused on the DC conductivity, there has recently been a surge of interest in the behavior of nanochannels under AC voltages. Here, we show that in nanochannels with electrically conducting walls, electrons can contribute to transporting ionic current through the channel. We identify a critical frequency and lengthscale above which electrons in the channel walls become the main charge carriers, resulting in a strongly increased conductivity. Our findings open the way to the engineering of nanofluidic functionalities based on ion-electron coupling.

Title: Three-body universality in the B meson sector
Authors: Yong-Hui Lin, Erik Wilbring, Hai-Long Fu, Hans-Werner Hammer, Ulf-G. Meißner
Abstract: The charged exotic mesons Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) observed by the Belle collaboration in 2011 are very close to the B* Bbar and B* Bbar* thresholds, respectively. This suggests their interpretation as shallow hadronic molecules of B and B* mesons. Using the masses of the Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) as input, we rule out the possibility for universal bound states of three B and B* mesons arising from the Efimov effect based on their spin-isospin structure. As a consequence, we can predict the phase shifts for the scattering of B and B* mesons off the exotic mesons Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) to leading order in a non-relativistic effective field theory with contact interactions based on two-body information alone.

Title: Universal Acceleration of Quantum Relaxation by Reset-Induced Mpemba Effect
Authors: Ruicheng Bao, Zhonghuai Hou
Abstract: Slow relaxation processes spanning widely separated timescales pose fundamental challenges for probing steady-state properties and engineering functional quantum systems, such as quantum heat engines and quantum computing devices. We introduce a universal quantum reset protocol that enables exponential acceleration of relaxation in general Markovian open quantum systems. The protocol induces a quantum Mpemba effect, wherein systems initialized farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to it, and crucially, this acceleration persists even when the slowest decaying Lindbladian modes form complex-conjugate pairs. Unlike previous approaches, which typically target a single mode, our protocol eliminates multiple relaxation modes simultaneously. This framework provides a versatile and experimentally feasible tool for controlling quantum relaxation timescales, with broad implications for quantum thermodynamics, computation, and state preparation.

Title: Minimal Autocorrelation in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations using Exact Fourier Acceleration
Authors: Johann Ostmeyer, Pavel Buividovich
Abstract: The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is a ubiquitous method in computational physics with applications ranging from condensed matter to lattice QCD and beyond. However, HMC simulations often suffer from long autocorrelation times, severely reducing their efficiency. In this work two of the main sources of autocorrelations are identified and eliminated. The first source is the sampling of the canonical momenta from a sub-optimal normal distribution, the second is a badly chosen trajectory length. Analytic solutions to both problems are presented and implemented in the exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) method. It completely removes autocorrelations for near-harmonic potentials and consistently yields (close-to-) optimal results for numerical simulations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Ising models as well as in lattice gauge theory, in some cases reducing the autocorrelation by multiple orders of magnitude. EFA is advantageous for and easily applicable to any HMC simulation of an action that includes a quadratic part.

Title: Exact Spin Correlators of Integrable Quantum Circuits from Algebraic Geometry
Authors: Arthur Hutsalyuk, Yunfeng Jiang, Balazs Pozsgay, Hefeng Xu, Yang Zhang
Abstract: We calculate the correlation functions of strings of spin operators for integrable quantum circuits exactly. These observables can be used for calibration of quantum simulation platforms. We use algebraic Bethe Ansatz, in combination with computational algebraic geometry to obtain analytic results for medium-size (around 10-20 qubits) quantum circuits. The results are rational functions of the quantum circuit parameters. We obtain analytic results for such correlation functions both in the real space and Fourier space. In the real space, we analyze the short time and long time limit of the correlation functions. In Fourier space, we obtain analytic results in different parameter regimes, which exhibit qualitatively different behaviors. Using these analytic results, one can easily generate numerical data to arbitrary precision.

Title: Enhanced Laser Cooling of a Mechanical Resonator via Zero-Photon Detection
Authors: Evan A. Cryer-Jenkins, Kyle D. Major, Jack Clarke, Georg Enzian, Magdalena Szczykulska, Jinglei Zhang, Arjun Gupta, Anthony C. Leung, Harsh Rathee, Andreas Ø. Svela, Anthony K. C. Tan, Almut Beige, Klaus Mølmer, Michael R. Vanner
Abstract: Throughout quantum science and technology, measurement is used as a powerful resource for nonlinear operations and quantum state engineering. In particular, single-photon detection is commonly employed for quantum-information applications and tests of fundamental physics. By contrast, and perhaps counter-intuitively, measurement of the absence of photons also provides useful information, and offers significant potential for a wide range of new experimental directions. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate cooling of a mechanical resonator below its laser-cooled mechanical occupation via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes scattered optical field and verify this cooling through heterodyne measurements. Our measurements are well captured by a stochastic master equation and the techniques introduced here open new avenues for cooling, quantum thermodynamics, quantum state engineering, and quantum measurement and control.

Title: Theoretical framework for enhancing or enabling cooling of a mechanical resonator via the anti-Stokes or Stokes interaction and zero-photon detection
Authors: Jack Clarke, Evan A. Cryer-Jenkins, Arjun Gupta, Kyle D. Major, Jinglei Zhang, Georg Enzian, Magdalena Szczykulska, Anthony C. Leung, Harsh Rathee, Andreas Ø. Svela, Anthony K. C. Tan, Almut Beige, Klaus Mølmer, Michael R. Vanner
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to describe how zero-photon detection may be utilized to enhance laser cooling via the anti-Stokes interaction and, somewhat surprisingly, enable cooling via the Stokes interaction commonly associated with heating. Our description includes both pulsed and continuous measurements as well as optical detection efficiency and open-system dynamics. For both cases, we discuss how the cooling depends on the system parameters such as detection efficiency and optomechanical cooperativity, and we study the continuous-measurement-induced dynamics, contrasting to single-photon detection events. For the Stokes case, we explore the interplay between cooling and heating via optomechanical parametric amplification, and we find the efficiency required to cool a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection. This work serves as a companion article to the recent experiment [E. A. Cryer-Jenkins, K. D. Major, et al., arXiv:2408.01734 (2024)], which demonstrated enhanced laser cooling of a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes signal. The framework developed here provides new approaches for cooling mechanical resonators that can be applied to a wide range of areas including nonclassical state preparation, quantum thermodynamics, and avoiding the often unwanted heating effects of parametric amplification.

Title: Neural network distillation of orbital dependent density functional theory
Authors: Matija Medvidović, Jaylyn C. Umana, Iman Ahmadabadi, Domenico Di Sante, Johannes Flick, Angel Rubio
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) offers a desirable balance between quantitative accuracy and computational efficiency in practical many-electron calculations. Its central component, the exchange-correlation energy functional, has been approximated with increasing levels of complexity ranging from strictly local approximations to nonlocal and orbital-dependent expressions with many tuned parameters. In this paper, we formulate a general way of rewriting complex density functionals using deep neural networks in a way that allows for simplified computation of Kohn-Sham potentials as well as higher functional derivatives through automatic differentiation, enabling access to highly nonlinear response functions and forces. These goals are achieved by using a recently developed class of robust neural network models capable of modeling functionals, as opposed to functions, with explicitly enforced spatial symmetries. Functionals treated in this way are then called global density approximations and can be seamlessly integrated with existing DFT workflows. Tests are performed for a dataset featuring a large variety of molecular structures and popular meta-generalized gradient approximation density functionals, where we successfully eliminate orbital dependencies coming from the kinetic energy density, and discover a high degree of transferability to a variety of physical systems. The presented framework is general and could be extended to more complex orbital and energy dependent functionals as well as refined with specialized datasets.

Title: Neural Network Matrix Product Operator: A Multi-Dimensionally Integrable Machine Learning Potential
Authors: Kentaro Hino, Yuki Kurashige
Abstract: A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schrödinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range. Our Python implementation is available at this https URL.

Title: An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Peng Zhang, Jing-Yuan Chen
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by Lüscher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.

Title: Average mutual information for random fermionic Gaussian quantum states
Authors: Lucas Hackl, Mario Kieburg, Joel Maldonado
Abstract: Studying the typical entanglement entropy of a bipartite system when averaging over different ensembles of pure quantum states has been instrumental in different areas of physics, ranging from many-body quantum chaos to black hole evaporation. We extend such analysis to open quantum systems and mixed states, where we compute the typical mutual information in a bipartite system averaged over the ensemble of mixed Gaussian states with a fixed spectrum. Tools from random matrix theory and determinantal point processes allow us to compute arbitrary k-point correlation functions of the singular values of the corresponding complex structure in a subsystem for a given spectrum in the full system. In particular, we evaluate the average von Neumann entropy in a subsystem based on the level density and the average mutual information. Those results are given for finite system size as well as in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Why do financial prices exhibit Brownian motion despite predictable order flow?
Authors: Yuki Sato, Kiyoshi Kanazawa
Abstract: In financial market microstructure, there are two enigmatic empirical laws: (i) the market-order flow has predictable persistence due to metaorder splitters by institutional investors, well formulated as the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model. However, this phenomenon seems paradoxical given the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics; (ii) the price impact $I(Q)$ of a large metaorder $Q$ follows the square-root law, $I(Q)\propto \sqrt{Q}$. Here we theoretically reveal why price dynamics follows Brownian motion despite predictable order flow by unifying these enigmas. We generalize the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model to nonlinear price-impact dynamics, which is mapped to an exactly solvable Lévy-walk model. Our exact solution shows that the price dynamics remains diffusive under the square-root law, even under persistent order flow. This work illustrates the crucial role of the square-root law in mitigating large price movements by large metaorders, thereby leading to the Brownian price dynamics, consistently with the efficient market hypothesis over long timescales.

Title: Computing Canonical Averages with Quantum and Classical Optimizers: Thermodynamic Reweighting for QUBO Models of Physical Systems
Authors: Francesco Slongo, Cristian Micheletti
Abstract: We present a general method to compute canonical averages for physical models sampled via quantum or classical quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). First, we introduce a histogram reweighting scheme applicable to QUBO-based sampling constrained to specific intervals of an order parameter, e.g., physical energy. Next, we demonstrate that the scheme can accurately recover the density of states, which in turn allows for calculating expectation values in the conjugate ensemble, e.g., at a fixed temperature. The method can thus be used to advance the state-of-the-art characterization of physical systems that admit a QUBO-based representation and that are otherwise intractable with real-space sampling methods. A case in point are space-filling melts of lattice ring polymers, recently mapped in QUBO form, for which our method reveals that the ring catenation probability is non-monotonic with the bending rigidity.

Title: Three-local Conserved Charge Implies Quantum Integrability
Authors: Zhao Zhang
Abstract: It is shown that the conservation of a local charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This establishes Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture as a theorem, ending the folklore that the existence of higher conserved charges imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.

Title: Equivalence of effective actions
Authors: Kevin Falls
Abstract: For the same quantum field theory distinct effective actions can be obtained by coupling sources to different choices of field variables. This is the same as considering effective actions for theories related by a change of variables and thus differ only by the values of so called inessential couplings. The effective actions will appear quite different since they generate correlation functions of different operators. Here we show that the effective actions are related by an implicit change of variables of the mean field, i.e. the argument of the effective action. Conversely, one can go the other way: by making a change of variables of the mean variable we obtain a new effective action which generates correlation functions of an implicitly defined composite field. The existence of the implicit transformations in both cases rests on the existence of solutions to initial value problems where the ``time'' parameter is an inessential coupling. Non-perturbatively the solutions may only exist for some non-zero amount of this time. However, at each order in perturbation theory one obtains linear equations which implies that unique solutions exist. We then show that scattering amplitudes are independent of inessential couplings without use of perturbation theory. For gauge theories we expect our correspondence to extend to effective actions which differ by a choice of gauge.
