Title: Low-temperature Spark Plasma Sintering of fine refractory composite powders core-shell: A case of the powders W@Ni

Baykov Institute of Metallurgy and Materials Science of the Russian Academy of Sciences)
Abstract: The mechanisms of fast low-temperature Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) of W + 10% wt. Ni powders were investigated. The powder compositions were obtained in two methods: (i) by mixing W and Ni powders in a specified ratio (hereinafter referred to as W + Ni); (ii) by Ni deposition on the surface of submicron W particles allowing the formation of particles with a core W - shell Ni structure (hereinafter referred to as W@Ni). To reduce the concentrations of oxygen and oxides, the powders were annealed in hydrogen. The solid-phase sintering was performed at various temperatures (1000-1150°C), pressures (40-80 MPa), heating rates (50-500°C/min), and isothermal holding times (0-20 min). The sintering temperatures corresponded to the onset of intense dissolution of W in Ni. The samples had high relative density and small grain sizes. The activation energy of SPS of the mixed powders was close to the one of the grain boundary diffusion. The key mechanism for the compaction of W@Ni particles in the SPS process is Coble creep. The increasing of the sintering temperature was shown to lead to an increase in the solubility of W in Ni and, consequently, to an increase in the number of secondary Ni4W particles formed during cooling down. The grain growth has a minor effect on the mechanical properties of the W alloy compared to the changes in its phase composition.

Title: Geometric Spin Rotation in Triangular Antiferromagnets
Authors: Grigor Adamyan, Bastian Pradenas, Boris Ivanov, Oleg Tchernyshyov
Abstract: We describe a geometric phenomenon in which a traveling wave made of degenerate Goldstone modes leaves behind a transformed ground state. In a triangular Heisenberg antiferromagnet, a pulse of circularly polarized spin waves rotates the spins within their plane. An exact solution of the nonlinear equations of motion demonstrates that the accumulated rotation is a geometric phase related to parallel transport of the order parameter. We point out a curious analogy between the motion of the magnetic order parameter and that of a wobbling coin. This phenomenon opens a new route for controlling antiferromagnetic order by spin waves and may extend to other frustrated magnets as well as other physical systems with noncommuting broken-symmetry generators.

Title: Extraordinary boundary correlations at deconfined quantum critical points
Authors: Hao-Ran Cui, Hart Goldman
Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing appreciation for the effects of quantum critical fluctuations on gapless boundary degrees of freedom. Here we consider the boundary dynamics of the non-compact $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ (NCCP$^{N-1}$) model in two spatial dimensions, with $N$ complex boson species coupled to a fluctuating $\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge field. These models describe quantum phase transitions beyond the Landau paradigm, such as the deconfined quantum critical point between superconducting (SC) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) phases. We show that, in a large-$N$ limit and with the bulk tuned to criticality, boundaries of the NCCP$^{N-1}$ model display logarithmically decaying, or ``extraordinary-log,'' correlations. In particular, when monopole operators exhibit quasi-long-ranged order at the boundary, we find that the extraordinary-log exponent of the NCCP$^{N-1}$ model in the large-$N$ limit is $q=N/4$, signifying a new family of boundary universality classes parameterized by $N$. In the context of the QSH -- SC transition, the quantum critical point inherits helical edge modes from the QSH phase, and this extraordinary-log behavior manifests in their Cooper pair correlations.

Title: Low energy excitations in a long prism geometry: computing the lower critical dimension of the Ising spin glass
Authors: Massimo Bernaschi, Luis Antonio Fernández, Isidoro González-Adalid Pemartín, Víctor Martín-Mayor, Giorgio Parisi, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi
Abstract: We propose a general method for studying systems that display excitations with arbitrarily low energy in their low-temperature phase. We argue that in a rectangular right prism geometry, with longitudinal size much larger than the transverse size, correlations decay exponentially (at all temperatures) along the longitudinal dimension, but the scaling of the correlation length with the transverse size carries crucial information from which the lower critical dimension can be inferred. The method is applied in the particularly demanding context of Ising spin glasses at zero magnetic field. The lower critical dimension and the multifractal spectrum for the correlation function are computed from large-scale numerical simulations. Several technical novelties (such as the unexpectedly crucial performance of Houdayer's cluster method or the convenience of using open - rather than periodic - boundary conditions) allow us to study three-dimensional prisms with transverse dimensions up to $L=24$ and effectively infinite longitudinal dimensions down to low temperatures. The value that we find for the lower critical dimension turns out to be in agreement with expectations from both the Replica Symmetry Breaking theory and the Droplet model for spin glasses. We argue that our novel setting holds promise in clarifying which of the two competing theories more accurately describes three-dimensional spin glasses.

Title: Level 2.5 large deviations and uncertainty relations for non-Markov self-interacting dynamics
Authors: Francesco Coghi, Amarjit Budhiraja, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We address the general problem of formulating the dynamical large deviations of non-Markovian systems in a closed form. Specifically, we consider a broad class of ``self-interacting'' jump processes whose dynamics depends on the past through a functional of a state-dependent empirical observable. Exploiting a natural separation of timescales, we obtain the exact (so-called ``level 2.5'') large deviation joint statistics of the empirical measure over configurations and of the empirical flux of transitions. As an application of this general framework, we derive explicit general bounds on the fluctuations of trajectory observables, generalising to the non-Markovian case both thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations. We illustrate our theory with simple examples, and discuss potential applications of these results.

Title: Mechanism-based metamaterials with microstructurally invariant shape-change
Authors: Yingchao Peng, Asifur Rahman, Paolo Celli, Paul Plucinsky
Abstract: Metamaterials with low-energy floppy modes called mechanisms are a burgeoning template for shape-morphing systems and structures across scales. Here, we present a design recipe that transforms an arbitrary plane tiling into a 2D kirigami pattern with a single degree-of-freedom mechanism motion, greatly expanding the known library of mechanism-based designs. We reveal that these kirigami patterns, when deformed along their mechanism, have a bulk shape change invariant to the underlying microstructure of the pattern. Experimental observations confirm this unusual kinematic prediction in illustrative classes of designs. We also exploit this invariance to elicit different elastic responses in patterns with identical bulk shape change. Finally, we discuss generalizations to compact and non-planar kirigami, as well as 3D metamaterials, highlighting the broad applicability of our new approach to design.

Title: Boundary-Induced Drift and Negative Mobility in Constrained Stochastic Systems
Authors: Meitar Goldfarb, Stanislav Burov
Abstract: We study overdamped stochastic dynamics confined by hard reflecting boundaries and show that the combination of boundary geometry and an anisotropic diffusion tensor generically generates directed motion. At the level of individual trajectories, the no-flux condition enforces an oblique reflection at the boundary, which produces a systematic drift parallel to the surface. The resulting local velocity takes the general form $v_B(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{t}(\mathbf{x})^{\!\top}\mathbf{D}\,\mathbf{n}(\mathbf{x})$, determined by the diffusion tensor $\mathbf{D}$ and the local boundary geometry encoded in the normal $\mathbf{n}$ and tangent $\mathbf{t}$. While this boundary-induced drift is local, it can accumulate into a macroscopic response, depending on the statistics of boundary encounters. We illustrate how this local boundary-induced drift gives rise to macroscopic transport using a minimal one-dimensional dimer composed of two particles with unequal diffusion coefficients. The repeated collisions act as reflections in configuration space and lead to sustained center-of-mass motion, including regimes of absolute negative mobility under constant forcing.

Title: Multiscale Analysis of Plasma-Modified Silk Fibroin and Chitosan Films
Authors: Jordan Nashed, Tomasz Bartkowiak, Alexandru Horia Marin, Tine Curk, Viviana Marcela Posada-Perez
Abstract: Biological interactions with material surfaces span a wide range of length scales, yet conventional surface measurements often fail to account for scale, limiting the insights they provide for surface engineering. Here, we investigate how multiscale surface descriptors of plasma-modified silk fibroin and chitosan surfaces modify bacterial and immune cell response. Surface chemistry and topography were characterized using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), followed by sliding bandpass filtration and multiscale curvature tensor-based methods to measure scale-dependent topographic features. Macrophage response and biofilm growth were assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Correlation strength showed scale-dependence with respect to surface features and biological structure: individual bacteria and small colonies correlated more strongly with fine-scale topographic features, whereas macrophage morphology correlated more strongly with larger-scale surface features. Notably, measured surface chemical descriptors generally did not correlate strongly with biofilm formation; nonetheless, chitosan and silk fibroin showed distinct trends in bacterial support, suggesting that material identity was not captured by the measured surface properties and that prevention of biofilms likely benefits from combinatorial approaches as opposed to physical surface modification alone. These results show that different biological structures interact with material surfaces at distinct length scales, as well as demonstrate the utility of multiscale analysis in identifying scales of interest in biological interactions with surfaces. Moreover, the data suggests that tailoring topographic feature size to the characteristic scale of the targeted biological entity is a potential strategy for antibacterial wound-healing materials without incurring cytotoxicity.

Title: Chiral Two-Body Bound States from Berry Curvature and Chiral Superconductivity
Authors: Daniil Karuzin, Leonid Levitov
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of exotic superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene, we study the two-body problem in electronic bands endowed with Berry curvature and show that it supports chiral, non-$s$-wave bound states with nonzero angular momentum. In the presence of a Fermi sea, these interactions give rise to a chiral pairing problem featuring multiple superconducting phases that break time-reversal symmetry. These phases form a cascade of chiral topological states with different angular momenta, where the order-parameter phase winds by $2\pi m$ around the Fermi surface, with $m = 1,3,5,\ldots$, and the succession of phases is governed by the Berry-curvature flux through the Fermi surface area, $\Phi = b k_F^2/2$. As $\Phi$ increases, the system undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions between distinct chiral phases, occurring whenever $\Phi$ crosses integer values. This realizes a quantum-geometry analog of the Little--Parks effect -- oscillations in $T_c$ that provide a clear and experimentally accessible hallmark of chiral superconducting order.

Title: A Nonlinear Mechanism for Transient Anomalous Diffusion
Authors: Gabriel Barreiro, Vladimir Pérez-Veloz
Abstract: Diffusion is a fundamental physical phenomenon with critical applications in fields such as metallurgy, cell biology, and population dynamics. While standard diffusion is well-understood, anomalous diffusion often requires complex non-local models. This paper investigates a nonlinear diffusion equation where the diffusion coefficient is linearly dependent on concentration. We demonstrate through a perturbative analysis that this physically-grounded model exhibits transient anomalous diffusion. The system displays a clear crossover from an initial subdiffusive regime to standard Fickian behavior at long times. This result establishes an important mechanism for trasient anomalous diffusion that arises purely from local interactions, providing an intuitive alternative to models based on fractional calculus or non-local memory effects.

Title: Multi-level charge fluctuations in a Si/SiGe double quantum dot device
Authors: Dylan Albrecht, Feiyang Ye, N. Tobias Jacobson, John M. Nichol
Abstract: Discrete charge fluctuations, routinely observed in semiconductor quantum dot devices, may contribute significantly to device drift and errors resulting from qubit miscalibration. Understanding the nature and origins of these discrete charge fluctuations may provide insights into material improvements or means of mitigating charge noise in semiconductor quantum dot devices. In this work, we measure multi-level charge fluctuations present in a Si/SiGe double quantum dot device over a range of device operating voltages and temperatures. To characterize the parameter-dependent dynamics of the underlying fluctuating degrees of freedom, we perform a detailed analysis of the measured noise timeseries. We perform algorithmically assisted drift detection and change point detection to detrend the data and remove a slow fluctuator component, as a preprocessing step. We perform model comparison on the post-processed time series between different $n$-level fluctuator ($n$LF) factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs), finding that although at most sweep values the independent pair of 2LFs model would be preferred, in a particular region of voltage space the 4LF model outperforms the other models, indicating a conditional rate dependence between the two fluctuators. By tracking fluctuator transition rates, biases, and weights over a range of different device configurations, we estimate gate voltage and conductivity sensitivity. In particular, we fit a phenomenological, detailed balance model to the extracted independent 2LFs rate data, yielding lever arm estimates in the range of $-2 \mu$eV/mV up to $4 \mu$eV/mV between the two 2LFs and nearby gate electrodes. We expect that these characterization results may aid in subsequent spatial triangulation of the charge fluctuators.

Title: Spreading and absorption of silicone oil droplets on silicone elastomer films
Authors: Lauren Dutcher, Benjamin Baylis, John R. Dutcher, Elie Raphael, Kari Dalnoki-Veress
Abstract: When a liquid droplet completely wets a hard substrate, its spreading dynamics follow Tanner's law, with the droplet radius growing as the one-tenth power of time. Here, we investigate how these dynamics change when silicone oil droplets spread on soft silicone elastomer and gel films supported by a rigid silicon substrate. While the droplets fully wet the elastomer surface, they also simultaneously swell the elastomer film. By varying the film thickness, we observe deviations from the classical power-law scaling, which we interpret in terms of changes to the effective stiffness and the absorption potential of the system. We describe the spreading behavior using a phenomenological model that accounts for both absorption and mechanical contributions.

Title: Symmetry-aware Conditional Generation of Crystal Structures Using Diffusion Models
Authors: Takanori Ishii, Kaoru Hisama, Kohei Shinohara
Abstract: The application of generative models in crystal structure prediction (CSP) has gained significant attention. Conditional generation--particularly the generation of crystal structures with specified stability or other physical properties has been actively researched for material discovery purposes. Meanwhile, the generative models capable of symmetry-aware generation are also under active development, because space group symmetry has a strong relationship with the physical properties of materials. In this study, we demonstrate that the symmetry control in the previous conditional crystal generation model may not be sufficiently effective when space group constraints are applied as a condition. To address this problem, we propose the WyckoffDiff-Adaptor, which embeds conditional generation within a WyckoffDiff architecture that effectively diffuses Wyckoff positions to achieve precise symmetry control. We successfully generated formation energy phase diagrams while specifying stable structures of particular combination of elements, such as Li--O and Ti--O systems, while simultaneously preserving the symmetry of the input conditions. The proposed method with symmetry-aware conditional generation demonstrates promising results as an effective approach to achieving the discovery of novel materials with targeted physical properties.

Title: Magnetoelectric torque in polar magnetic bilayers
Authors: Zhong Shen, Jun Chen, Xiaoyan Yao, Shuai Dong
Abstract: Energy-efficient fast switching of spin orientations or textures is a core issue of spintronics, which is highly demanded but remains challenging. Different from the mainstream routes based on spin-transfer torque or spin-orbit torque, here we propose another mechanism coined as magnetoelectric torque to switch the magnetization in polar magnetic bilayers via pure electric field. In some magnetic van der Waals bilayers, when the electrostatic energy of polarization can compensate the interlayer magnetic coupling, a magnetoelectric torque is generated to fastly flip spins within a few picoseconds, which is demonstrated by combining the first-principles calculations, analytic model, as well as atomistic simulations. Such a magnetoelectric torque doesn't rely on the spin-orbit coupling and is generally active in polar magnetic homostructures and heterostructures. Our work provides an alternative route to switch magnetization in nanoscale, which may benefit the energy-saving and fast-response spintronic devices.

Title: Brownian motion of a rod threading through a ring with fixed ring-center
Authors: Zhongqiang Xiong, Shigeyuki Komura, Masao Doi
Abstract: We study the Brownian motion of a rigid rod threading through a small fixed ring while the ring can freely rotate. We derive the distribution function for the sliding displacement and the unit vector along the rod both at equilibrium and non-equilibrium. The equilibrium distribution is quadratic in the sliding displacement and is controlled by the moment of inertia (mass distribution). Applying the Onsager variational principle, we derive a Smoluchowski equation in which sliding and rotational diffusion are coupled. The mean square displacement (MSD) of sliding shows a metastable plateau in a certain time range before it approaches the final equilibrium value. The longest sliding relaxation time decreases as $\alpha^{-1/2}$ as the moment of inertia increases. The rotational relaxation time obtained from the orientational correlation function is longer than that of a rod with its center fixed but faster than a rod with one end fixed. These results may be useful in understanding the dynamics of polymers connected by sliding rings.

Title: Autonomous Materials Exploration by Integrating Automated Phase Identification and AI-Assisted Human Reasoning
Authors: Ming-Chiang Chang, Maximilian Amsler, Duncan R. Sutherland, Sebastian Ament, Katie R. Gann, Lan Zhou, Louisa M. Smieska, Arthur R. Woll, John M. Gregoire, Carla P. Gomes, R. Bruce van Dover, Michael O. Thompson
Abstract: Autonomous experimentation holds the potential to accelerate materials development by combining artificial intelligence (AI) with modular robotic platforms to explore extensive combinatorial chemical and processing spaces. Such self-driving laboratories can not only increase the throughput of repetitive experiments, but also incorporate human domain expertise to drive the search towards user-defined objectives, including improved materials performance metrics. We present an autonomous materials synthesis extension to SARA, the Scientific Autonomous Reasoning Agent, utilizing phase information provided by an automated probabilistic phase labeling algorithm to expedite the search for targeted phase regions. By incorporating human input into an expanded SARA-H (SARA with human-in-the-loop) framework, we enhance the efficiency of the underlying reasoning process. Using synthetic benchmarks, we demonstrate the efficiency of our AI implementation and show that the human input can contribute to significant improvement in sampling efficiency. We conduct experimental active learning campaigns using robotic processing of thin-film samples of several oxide material systems, including Bi$_2$O$_3$, SnO$_x$, and Bi-Ti-O, using lateral-gradient laser spike annealing to synthesize and kinetically trap metastable phases. We showcase the utility of human-in-the-loop autonomous experimentation for the Bi-Ti-O system, where we identify extensive processing domains that stabilize $\delta$-Bi$_2$O$_3$ and Bi$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, explore dwell-dependent ternary oxide phase behavior, and provide evidence confirming predictions that cationic substitutional doping of TiO$_2$ with Bi inhibits the unfavorable transformation of the metastable anatase to the ground-state rutile phase. The autonomous methods we have developed enable the discovery of new materials and new understanding of materials synthesis and properties.

Title: Nodal Superconductivity of UTe$_2$ Probed by Field-Angle-Resolved Specific Heat on a Crystal with $T_{\rm c}=2.1$ K
Authors: Kaito Totsuka, Yohei Kono, Yusei Shimizu, Ai Nakamura, Atsushi Miyake, Dai Aoki, Yasumasa Tsutsumi, Kazushige Machida, Shunichiro Kittaka
Abstract: Field-angle-resolved specific-heat measurements were performed on a clean single crystal of a spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}=2.1$ K and a low residual electronic specific heat. At low temperatures, the specific heat exhibits a linear dependence on the magnetic field when the field is applied precisely along the $b$ axis, in stark contrast to its rapid increase at low fields for other orientations. This pronounced anisotropy suggests the presence of nodal quasiparticle excitations with the Fermi velocity predominantly aligned along the $b$ axis. Considering the characteristic field-angle dependences of both the specific heat and the upper critical field, these observations are broadly compatible with theoretical models that assume a superconducting gap structure featuring either point nodes consistent with $B_{\rm 2u}$ symmetry, allowed in the infinitely strong spin-orbit coupling scheme, or line nodes confined to flat regions of the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface, consistent with $^3B_{\rm 3u}$ symmetry in the finite spin-orbit classification scheme. These results yield crucial hints for resolving the pairing symmetry of UTe$_2$, paving the way for a deeper understanding of its spin-triplet superconductivity.

Title: Pressure-Induced Martensitic Phase Transformation and Microstructure Evolution in nanograined $\text{Fe}\text{-}7\%\text{Mn}$ Alloy
Authors: Mrinmay Sahu, Sorb Yesudhas, Valery I. Levitas, Dean Smith
Abstract: The Fe-Mn-based alloys are receiving immense attention due to their applications in the third generation of advanced high-strength steels, owing to their high strength and ductility. A detailed in situ high-pressure structural phase transformation and microstructural evolution in nanograined $\text{Fe}\text{-}7\%\text{Mn}$ alloy has been performed using the axial synchrotron X-ray diffraction technique. The ambient BCC phase of $\text{Fe}\text{-}7\%\text{Mn}$ undergoes pressure-driven structural PT to the HCP phase at 11.4 GPa. Both BCC and HCP phases coexist up to 15.9 GPa; thereafter, they transform into a pure HCP phase, which remains stable up to the maximum pressure of 30.3 GPa. The XRD study reveals that the $(110)_{\mathrm{b}}$ dense crystallographic plane of the BCC lattice transforms into a densely packed $(002)_{\mathrm{h}}$ peak of the HCP lattice following the orientational relationship $(110)_{\mathrm{b}} \parallel (0001)_{\mathrm{h}}$ via diffusionless $ \mathrm{Burger's} $ martensitic crystallographic PT pathway. The evolution of crystallite size and microstrain with pressure shows a distinct change during the structural PT. The microstrain exhibits a sharp anomaly at around 10 GPa, suggesting that the microstructural changes precede the structural PT.

Title: Influence of Local Icosahedral Short-Range Order on the Magnetization Dynamics of Amorphous Cobalt-Iron Nanodisks
Authors: Erick Burgos-Parra, Matías Sepulveda-Macías
Abstract: The microscopic origin of soft magnetic properties in amorphous alloys is fundamentally linked to the interplay between local topological disorder and magnetic exchange interactions. In this work, we employ a multiscale Spin-Lattice Dynamics (SLD) approach to investigate the magnetostructural correlations in amorphous Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$ nanodisks ($x=35, 50, 65$). By integrating classical molecular dynamics with a generalized magnetic Hamiltonian, we capture the dynamic feedback loop between lattice vibrations and spin precession. Topological analysis via Voronoi tessellation reveals a persistent species-dependent structural heterogeneity: Cobalt atoms preferentially adopt "solid-like" icosahedral packing, forming a rigid structural backbone, whereas Iron atoms exhibit a higher propensity for "liquid-like" disordered environments. We demonstrate that this topological disparity dictates the macroscopic magnetic response. The Cobalt-driven structural stiffness preserves a robust exchange network that maximizes saturation magnetization, while the local disorder inherent to Iron-rich regions introduces exchange fluctuations that act as an intrinsic damping mechanism, delaying magnetic relaxation. These findings provide an atomistic explanation for the stability of ferromagnetic order in Co-Fe metallic glasses and offer a pathway for tuning damping parameters in amorphous spintronic devices through stoichiometric control.

Title: Large room temperature anomalous Nernst effect coupled with topological Nernst effect from incommensurate spin structure in a Kagome antiferromagnet
Authors: Jiajun Ma, Jiaxing Liao, Yazhou Li, Yuwei Zhang, Jialu Wang, Jinke Bao, Yan Sun, Shuang Jia, Yuke Li
Abstract: Kagome magnets exhibit a range of novel and nontrivial topological properties due to the strong interplay between topology and magnetism, which also extends to their thermoelectric applications. Recent advances in the study of magnetic topological materials have highlighted their intriguing anomalous Hall and thermoelectric effects, arising primarily from large intrinsic Berry curvature. Here, we report observation of a large room-temperature (RT) anomalous Nernst effects (ANE) of S_xy^A ~ 1.3 {\mu}V K^(-1) in the kagome antiferromagnet (AFM) ErMn6Sn6, which is comparable to the largest signals observed in known magnetic materials. Surprisingly, we further found that a significant topological Nernst signal at RT and peaking a maximum of approximately 0.2 {\mu}V K^(-1) at 180 K, exactly coupling with ANE in the spiral AFM state, originates from the real-space nonzero spin chirality caused by incommensurate spin structure. This study demonstrates a potential room-temperature thermoelectric application platform based on Nernst effect, and provides insights for discovering significant anomalous and topological transverse transport effects in the incommensurate AFM system.

Title: Designing topological edge states in bacterial active matter
Authors: Yoshihito Uchida, Daiki Nishiguchi, Kazumasa A. Takeuchi
Abstract: Topology provides a unifying framework for understanding robust transport through protected edge states arising from nontrivial wavenumber topology. Extending these concepts to active matter, however, remains largely unexplored experimentally, with realizations limited to systems composed of chiral active particles. Here, we realize topological edge states in dense bacterial suspension, which represents a prototypical active matter system, using microfabricated geometrical structures with nontrivial wavenumber topology. Inspired by previous theoretical studies, we constructed a directional kagome network composed of ratchet-shaped channels that induce unidirectional bacterial flow. In this network, we found clear edge localization of bacterial density. A steady-state analysis based on the bacterial transport model and experimentally measured velocity field reveals how the characteristic collective flow generates edge localization. The model also uncovers the topological origin of the observed edge states. By tuning the geometry of the microfabricated networks, we identified directional channel design and network chirality as the key design features essential for the emergence of the edge state. Our results pave the way for establishing a control and design principle of topological transport in such active matter systems.

Title: Giant Hole-doping in 2H-WSe2 via Ta Substitution
Authors: Minhee Kang, Woojin Choi, Choongyu Hwang, Jinwoong Hwang
Abstract: The family of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) has been regarded as promising candidates for future electronics, valleytronics, spintronics, and optoelectronics. While most of TMDCs are intrinsic n-type semiconductors due to electron donation from chalcogen vacancies, realizing intrinsic p-type TMDCs and achieving precise control over their electronic properties remain challenging. In this work, we introduce a powerful approach to obtain intrinsic hole doping by substituting Ta atom into 2H-WSe2. A combining study of molecular beam epitaxy growth and in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy characterization clearly reveals that Ta substitution induces a significant hole doping and provides a possible way of a semiconductor-to-metal transition in 2H-WSe2.

Title: A microscopic origin for the breakdown of the Stokes Einstein relation in ion transport
Authors: Zhenyu Wei, Mu Chen, Jun Ren, Pinyao He, Wei Xu, Wei Liu, Fei Zheng, Yin Zhang, Wei Si, Jinjie Sha, Zhonghua Ni, Yunfei Chen
Abstract: Ion transport underlies the operation of biological ion channels and governs the performance of electrochemical energy-storage devices. A long-standing anomaly is that smaller alkali metal ions, such as Li$^+$, migrate more slowly in water than larger ions, in apparent violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation. This breakdown is conventionally attributed to dielectric friction, a collective drag force arising from electrostatic interactions between a drifting ion and its surrounding solvent. Here, combining nanopore transport measurements over electric fields spanning several orders of magnitude with molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the time-averaged electrostatic force on a migrating ion is not a drag force but a net driving force. By contrasting charged ions with neutral particles, we reveal that ionic charge introduces additional Lorentzian peaks in the frequency-dependent friction coefficient. These peaks originate predominantly from short-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions within the first hydration layer and represent additional channels for energy dissipation, strongest for Li$^+$ and progressively weaker for Na$^+$ and K$^+$. Our results demonstrate that electrostatic interactions primarily act to tighten the local hydration structure, thereby amplifying short-range LJ interactions rather than directly opposing ion motion. This microscopic mechanism provides a unified physical explanation for the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation in aqueous ion transport.

Title: Nodal-line-enhanced quantum geometric effects: anomalous and nonlinear Hall effects in the parity-mixed antiferromagnet NbMnP
Authors: Ibuki Terada, Vu Thi Ngoc Huyen, Yuki Yanagi, Michi-To Suzuki
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect has been understood in terms of the geometric nature of Bloch bands and impurity scattering, and has been observed in a wide variety of magnetic materials such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Recently, a large anomalous Hall effect was reported in the noncollinear antiferromagnetic metal NbMnP whose magnetic order is a mixture of the even-parity and the odd-parity magnetic components. Such a magnetic structure is expected to exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and the nonlinear Hall effect from the symmetry breaking of the antiferromagnet ordering. Here, we theoretically investigate the intrinsic anomalous and nonlinear Hall effect of NbMnP induced by the quantum geometry of Bloch band using the first-principles calculation and the Wannier interpolation method. We found that the intrinsic Hall response of NbMnP is predominantly governed by the strongly enhanced Berry curvature and Berry-connection-polarization dipole on a specific mirror plane. These enhanced geometric quantities originate from the spin-orbit-coupling-induced gap openings along the nodal lines. Our results indicate that NbMnP serves as a model system for investigating transport phenomena originating from nodal-lines in parity-mixed antiferromagnets.

Title: From Lyotropic to Thermotropic Behavior: Solvent-Free Liquid Crystalline Phases in Polymer-Surfactant-Conjugated Rod-shaped Colloidal Viruses
Authors: Lohitha R. Hegde, Kamendra P. Sharma, Eric Grelet
Abstract: Filamentous bacteriophages fd are viral particles, highly monodisperse in size, that have been widely used as a model colloidal system for studying the self-assembly of rod-shaped particles as well as a versatile template in nanoscience. In aqueous suspensions, fd viruses exhibit lyotropic behavior, forming liquid crystalline phases as their concentration increases. Here, we report a solvent-free system displaying thermotropic phase behavior, achieved through covalent coupling of low molecular weight PEG-based polymer surfactant onto the fd virus surface. Upon lyophilization of aqueous suspensions of these polymer-grafted bacteriophages and subsequent thermal annealing, a solvent-free material is obtained, exhibiting both viscoelasticity and, notably, thermotropic liquid crystalline properties. A combination of small-angle X-ray scattering and optical microscopy experiments reveals the formation of an ordered hexagonal mesophase below 30 °C, which undergoes a melting transition into an isotropic liquid at higher temperatures. Our results demonstrate an efficient approach for converting lyotropic into thermotropic phase behavior in the columnar liquid crystalline phase of filamentous fd colloids. This approach paves the way for extending such functionalization to other technologically relevant rod-like systems, such as carbon nanotubes and cellulose nanocrystals, enabling the introduction of thermotropic properties in anhydrous colloidal materials.

Title: Critical quantum states and hierarchical spectral statistics in a Cantor potential
Authors: F. Iwase
Abstract: We study the spectral statistics and wave-function properties of a one-dimensional quantum system subject to a Cantor-type fractal potential. By analyzing the nearest-neighbor level spacings, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and the scaling behavior of the integrated density of states (IDS), we demonstrate how the self-similar geometry of the potential is imprinted on the quantum spectrum. The energy-resolved level spacings form a hierarchical, filamentary structure, in sharp contrast to those of periodic and random systems. The normalized level-spacing distribution exhibits a bimodal structure, reflecting the deterministic recurrence of spectral gaps. A multifractal analysis of eigenstates reveals critical behavior: the generalized fractal dimensions $D_q$ lie strictly between the limits of extended and localized states, exhibiting a distinct $q$-dependence. Consistently, the IPR indicates the coexistence of quasi-extended and localized features, characteristic of critical wave functions. The IDS shows anomalous power-law scaling at low energies, with an exponent close to the Hausdorff dimension of the underlying Cantor set, indicating that the geometric fractality governs the spectral dimensionality. At higher energies, this scaling crosses over to the semiclassical Weyl law. Our results establish a direct connection between deterministic fractal geometry, hierarchical spectral statistics, and quantum criticality.

Title: Effect of Interatomic Potential Choice on Fracture Modes of Graphene with Parallel Cracks
Authors: Suyeong Jin, Jung-Wuk Hong, Alexandre F. Fonseca
Abstract: Defect engineering via parallel cracks has been proposed as a route to tailor the fracture response of graphene. However, atomistic fracture predictions can be strongly sensitive to the interatomic potential. Here, we quantify the effect of potential choice by revisiting H-passivated graphene containing two parallel cracks separated by a gap $W_{\text{gap}}$ loaded in tension along the armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) directions. Molecular dynamics simulations using the AIREBO potential under the same geometry and loading protocol previously studied with ReaxFF, are employed, so enabling a direct comparison. Stress-strain responses, Young's modulus, an effective mode-I stress intensity factor, and energy absorption are evaluated as functions of $W_{\text{gap}}$. Compared with ReaxFF, AIREBO predicts lower peak stresses and earlier catastrophic softening, leading to reduced post-peak deformation capacity and energy absorption. Ductility and energy absorption are shown to be highly potential-dependent, underscoring the need for careful potential selection in defect-engineered graphene fracture simulations.

Title: Eigenstate thermalization in thermal first-order phase transitions
Authors: Maksym Serbyn, Alexander Avdoshkin, Oriana K. Diessel, David A. Huse
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) posits how isolated quantum many-body systems thermalize, assuming that individual eigenstates at the same energy density have identical expectation values of local observables in the limit of large systems. While the ETH apparently holds across a wide range of interacting quantum systems, in this work we show that it requires generalization in the presence of thermal first-order phase transitions. We introduce a class of all-to-all spin models, featuring first-order thermal phase transitions that stem from two distinct mean-field solutions (two ``branches'') that exchange dominance in the many-body density of states as the energy is varied. We argue that for energies in the vicinity of the thermal phase transition, eigenstate expectation values do not need to converge to the same thermal value. The system has a regime with coexistence of two classes of eigenstates corresponding to the two branches with distinct expectation values at the same energy density, and another regime with Schrodinger-cat-like eigenstates that are inter-branch superpositions; these two regimes are separated by an eigenstate phase transition. We support our results by semiclassical calculations and an exact diagonalization study of a microscopic spin model, and argue that the structure of eigenstates in the vicinity of thermal first-order phase transitions can be experimentally probed via non-equilibrium dynamics.

Title: Collinear Magnetic Structure in the Diamond Network Magnet EuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$
Authors: Masahiro Kawamata, Ryuji Higashinaka, Takeshi Matsumura, Maxim Avdeev, Kazuaki Iwasa, Hironori Nakao, Kazumasa Hattori, Tatsuma D. Matsuda
Abstract: The magnetic structure of EuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$, in which magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions form a diamond network, was investigated using neutron and resonant X-ray diffraction on powder and single-crystal samples. The propagation vector was determined to be $\textbf{\textit{q}}_{\rm m}=(1,0,0)$~r.l.u. from these diffraction measurements. All possible magnetic structures in the space group $Fd\bar{3}m$ with this propagation vector were examined using the irreducible representation method and magnetic space group analysis. This magnetic structure was identified as a collinear antiferromagnetic structure with the magnetic space group $P_Inna$ (\#52.320) or $P_Inn2$ (\#34.164) under zero magnetic field. In these magnetic structure, frustration arises from competing magnetic interactions on the diamond network. These findings provide a concrete experimental reference for assessing the role of competing interactions in diamond-network magnets and motivate further studies of interaction-driven quantum states.

Title: Unavoidable Canonical Nonlinearity Induced by Gaussian Measures Discretization
Authors: Koretaka Yuge
Abstract: When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems, with future potential applications to configurational thermodynamics.

Title: Fractional-Monolayer 2D-GaN/AlN Structures: Growth Kinetics and UVC-emitter Applications
Authors: V.N. Jmerik, D.V. Nechaev, E.A. Evropeitsev, E.M. Roginskii, A.N. Semenov, M.A. Yagovkina, P.A. Alekseev, V.I. Kozlovsky, M.M. Zverev, N.A. Gamov, Tao Wang, Xinqiang Wang, T.V. Shubina, A.A. Toropov
Abstract: The paper reports on fundamental properties of the GaN/AlN quantum wells (QWs) with nominal subcritical thicknesses of 0.75-2 monolayers (MLs). They are grown by plasma-activated molecular beam epitaxy, varying either the nominal thickness or the gallium-to-nitrogen flux ratio. In situ monitoring reveals difference in 2D nucleation and step-flow growth modes of the QWs. The emission charactestics of QWs with integer thicknesses of 1 and 2 MLs depend weakly on the growth mechanism. In contrast, the intensity and spectral position luminescence of QWs with fractional-ML thicknesses are determined by the growth mechanism. Using ab initio calculations, a phenomenological model is proposed that describes fractional-ML QWs either as arrays of 2D quantum disks or as arrays of 2D quantum ribbons, in cases where 2D nucleation or step-flow growth mechanisms predominate, respectively. This model is generally consistent with experimental data on photo- and cathodoluminescence of heterostructures with multiple (250) GaN/AlN QWs. These heterostructures, when pumped by electrom beam at an energy 12.5 keV with a maximum pulse current of 2 A, exhibit linear current dependences of optical peak powers up to 1 and 37 W for wavelengths of 228 and 256 nm, respectively, making them promising for use as powerfull ultraviolet-C emitters.

Title: Beyond uniform screening: electrostatic heterogeneity dictates solution structure of complex macromolecules
Authors: Fabrizio Camerin, Marco Polimeni, Letizia Tavagnacco, Jeffrey C. Everts, Szilard Saringer, Alessandro Gulotta, Nicholas Skar-Gislinge, Anna Stradner, Emanuela Zaccarelli, Peter Schurtenberger
Abstract: The complexity of biomolecular interactions necessitates advanced methodologies to accurately capture their behavior in solution. In this work, we focus on monoclonal antibodies and adopt a multi-scale coarse-graining strategy for their modeling, with particular emphasis on the role of electrostatic interactions. Using scattering experiments, theoretical analysis, and large-scale computer simulations, we explicitly compare two selected case studies-markedly different in their charge distributions. Through mutually corroborating lines of evidence, we demonstrate that conventional approaches relying on electrostatic screening and implicit charge representations fail to capture the structural and thermodynamic properties of antibody solutions when strong charge heterogeneity is present, even at a moderate (amino acid) level of coarse-graining. These findings highlight the importance of a correct treatment of electrostatic interactions and ion screening for heterogeneously- and oppositely-charged colloidal and protein systems. Such considerations are essential to move beyond descriptive models towards a truly predictive framework, with direct implications for the formulation of therapeutics and the treatment of other complex soft-matter systems.

Title: Linear Canonical-Ensemble Quantum Monte Carlo: From Dilute Fermi Gas to Flat-Band Ferromagnetism
Authors: Tu Hong, Kun Chen, Xiao Yan Xu
Abstract: We present a finite-temperature canonical-ensemble determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that enforces an exact fermion number and enables stable simulations of correlated lattice electrons. We propose a stabilized QR update that reduces the computational complexity from standard cubic scaling $O(\beta N^3)$ to linear scaling $O(\beta N N_e^2)$ with respect to the system size $N$, where $N_e$ is the particle number. This yields a dramatic speedup in dilute regimes ($N_e \ll N$), opening unbiased access to large-scale simulations of strongly correlated low-density phases. We validate the method on the dilute electron gas with onsite Hubbard interactions, observing the suppression of the fermion sign problem in the dilute limit. Furthermore, we apply this approach to an one-dimensional flat-band system, where the canonical ensemble allows for precise control over filling. We reveal a ferromagnetic instability at low temperatures in the half-filling regime. Our linear-scaling approach provides a powerful tool for investigating emergent phenomena in dilute quantum matter.

Title: Kinetic Blockade and Filamentary Pair Density Waves in Strain-Engineered Graphene
Authors: Tao Zhou
Abstract: We investigate superconductivity in strain-engineered graphene using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach. Challenging the paradigm that the high density of states in flat bands universally enhances pairing, we identify a "kinetic blockade" mechanism: strain-induced sublattice polarization segregates electronic states, rendering these singularities inert. Instead, superconductivity emerges as robust filaments at geometric nodes, forming a pair density wave. This state features a sign-reversing order parameter, detectable via impurity-induced zero-energy modes. Our findings reveal a unique geometric origin for filamentary superconductivity, offering new perspectives on strain-tuned quantum phases in Dirac materials.

Title: Magnetization reversal mechanism of double-helix nanowires probed by dark-field magneto-optical Kerr effect
Authors: Takeaki Gokita, Jakub Jurczyk, Naëmi Leo, Sabri Koraltan, Alberto Anadón, Miguel Ángel Cascales-Sandoval, Rachid Belkhou, Claas Abert, Dieter Suess, Claire Donnelly, Amalio Fernández-Pacheco
Abstract: Double-helix (DH) nanowires provide a platform to study the influence of geometric chirality on spin chirality. Their three-dimensional (3D) helical architecture and tunable inter-strand coupling enable control of spin chirality, including the stabilization of topological 3D magnetic states such as helical domains and domain walls, topological stray fields, and extended helical vortex/skyrmion tubes. So far, the study of these and other 3D nanostructures is usually confined to a limited number of magnetic microscopy experiments in large facilities. Here, we investigate the reversal mechanism of a single DH nanowire using Dark-Field magneto-optical Kerr effect (DF-MOKE) magnetometry under external 3D magnetic fields. By analyzing the angular dependence of the DF-MOKE signal, we fit the reversal process using established models for domain-wall nucleation and propagation, finding a characteristic behavior similar to that reported for cylindrical nanowires. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the reversal process goes through nucleation of the helical vortex tube in a curling manner while ptychographic X-ray magnetic circular dichroism data reveal that this helical vortex tube state forms through a mixed nucleation-propagation process. These observations provide a consistent microscopic picture of reversal mediated by a helical vortex tube extending along the nanowire. Our work provides a comprehensive characterization of magnetization reversal in DH nanowires and demonstrates that DF-MOKE magnetometry is effective for probing reversal mechanisms in single 3D nanostructures. This lab-based approach expands the range of accessible experiments beyond large-scale facilities, enabling extensive exploration of the rich spin states supported by 3D nano-geometries.

Title: Generalized cluster states in 2+1d: non-invertible symmetries, interfaces, and parameterized families
Authors: Kansei Inamura, Shuhei Ohyama
Abstract: We construct 2+1-dimensional lattice models of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with non-invertible symmetries and investigate their properties using tensor networks. These models, which we refer to as generalized cluster models, are constructed by gauging a subgroup symmetry $H \subset G$ in models with a finite group 0-form symmetry $G$. By construction, these models have a non-invertible symmetry described by the group-theoretical fusion 2-category $\mathcal{C}(G; H)$. After identifying the tensor network representations of the symmetry operators, we study the symmetry acting on the interface between two generalized cluster states. In particular, we will see that the symmetry at the interface is described by a multifusion category known as the strip 2-algebra. By studying possible interface modes allowed by this symmetry, we show that the interface between generalized cluster states in different SPT phases must be degenerate. This result generalizes the ordinary bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we construct parameterized families of generalized cluster states and study the topological charge pumping phenomena, known as the generalized Thouless pump. We exemplify our construction with several concrete cases, and compare them with known phases, such as SPT phases with $2\mathrm{Rep}((\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]})\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[0]})$ symmetry.

Title: Parameterized families of 2+1d $G$-cluster states
Authors: Shuhei Ohyama, Kansei Inamura
Abstract: We construct a $G$-cluster Hamiltonian in 2+1 dimensions and analyze its properties. This model exhibits a $G\times2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry, where the $2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ sector realizes a non-invertible symmetry obtained by condensing appropriate algebra objects in $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$. Using the symmetry interpolation method, we construct $S^1$- and $S^2$-parameterized families of short-range-entangled (SRE) states by interpolating an either invertible $0$-form or $1$-form symmetry contained in $G\times2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$. Applying an adiabatic evolution argument to this family, we analyze the pumped interface mode generated by this adiabatic process. We then explicitly construct the symmetry operator acting on the interface and show that the interface mode carries a nontrivial charge under this symmetry, thereby demonstrating the nontriviality of the parameterized family.

Title: Coupling of Klein-Andreev Resonant States in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$-graphene-Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ Devices
Authors: Sharadh Jois, Jose L. Lado, Genda Gu, Qiang Li, Ji Ung Lee
Abstract: Quantum devices require coherent coupling over macroscopic distances. Recently, resonances due to Klein tunneling and Andreev reflection states (KARS) have been observed in a naturally occurring p-n junction at the interface between Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (BSCCO), a high-Tc superconductor (HTS), and graphene. The resonances appear as conductance oscillations with gating. Here, we show coupling between the KARS in BSCCO-graphene-BSCCO devices of varying separation (L). The coupling is evidenced by a power-law decay of resonance period as L increases from tens of nanometers to single microns. These results demonstrate the long-distance coupling of KARS cavities in graphene-HTS junctions. The length dependence seen in experiments is supported by single-particle spectral functions which show KARS are coupled by transport modes in graphene. The strong coupling between KARS in BSCCO-graphene-BSCCO junctions showcases the novelty of HTS-graphene junctions for quantum circuits and unconventional Josephson junctions.

Title: Reduction of Ordered Spin Moments in Antiferromagnets of S = 5/2 Ions (Fe3+, Mn2+) Driven by Local Magnetic Excitation
Authors: Myung-Hwan Whangbo, Reinhard K. Kremer, Hyun-Joo Koo
Abstract: For antiferromagnets composed of spin five-half ions, the moments of these ions in the ordered antiferromagnetic state can be significantly smaller than 5 BM (i.e., 1.56 - 4.48 BM) if these ions form quantum fluctuating entities (QFEs), for example, quasi one-dimensional uniform antiferromagnetic chains or quasi zero-spin antiferromagnetic spin dimers. It is reasonable to suppose that the stronger the quantum fluctuation in such an antiferromagnet, the greater the reduction in its ordered moment would become, but this supposition has not yet been confirmed because quantifying the strength of quantum fluctuation is not a straightforward matter. Here we show that the local magnetic excitations involving the QFEs can be used to quantify the strength of quantum fluctuation by analyzing six antiferromagnets showing significant reduction in their ordered spin moments.

Title: Dynamical stability by spin transfer in nearly isotropic magnets
Authors: Hidekazu Kurebayashi, Joseph Barker, Takumi Yamazaki, Varun K. Kushwaha, Kilian D. Stenning, Harry Youel, Xueyao Hou, Troy Dion, Daniel Prestwood, Gerrit E. W. Bauer, Kei Yamamoto, Takeshi Seki
Abstract: Spin transfer torques (STTs) control magnetisation by electric currents, enabling a range of nano-scale spintronic applications. They can destabilise the equilibrium magnetisation state by counteracting magnetic relaxation. Here, we maximise the STT effect through a dedicated growth-annealing protocol for CoFeB thin films, such that magnetic anisotropies originating from the interface and shape almost cancel each other. The nearly isotropic magnets enable low-current dynamical stabilisation of the magnetisation in the direction opposite to an applied magnetic field, thereby realising a spintronic analogue of the Kapitza pendulum. In an intermediate current regime, the STT drives large magnetisation vector fluctuations that cover the entire Bloch sphere. The continuous variable associated with the stochastic magnetisation direction may serve as a resource for probabilistic computing and neuromorphic hardware. Our results establish isotropic magnets as a platform to study as-yet-uncharted, far-from-equilibrium spin dynamics including anti-magnonics, with promising implications for unconventional computing paradigms.

Title: Stochastic search with space-dependent diffusivity
Authors: Hwai-Ray Tung, Sean D Lawley
Abstract: The canonical model of stochastic search tracks a randomly diffusing "searcher" until it finds a "target." Owing to its many applications across science and engineering, this perennially popular problem has been thoroughly investigated in a variety of models. However, aside from some exactly solvable one-dimensional examples, very little is known if the searcher diffusivity varies in space. For such space-dependent or "heterogeneous" diffusion, one must specify the interpretation of the multiplicative noise, which is termed the Itô-Stratonovich dilemma. In this paper, we investigate how stochastic search with space-dependent diffusivity depends on this interpretation. We obtain general formulas for the probability distribution and all the moments of the stochastic search time and the so-called splitting probabilities assuming that the targets are small or weakly reactive. These asymptotic results are valid for general space-dependent diffusivities in general domains in any space dimension with targets of general shape which may be in the interior or on the boundary of the domain. We illustrate our theory with stochastic simulations. Our analysis predicts that stochastic search can depend strongly and counterintuitively on the multiplicative noise interpretation.

Title: Cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted phonon formalism within density functional perturbation theory
Authors: Abhiraj Sharma, Phanish Suryanarayana
Abstract: We present a first-principles framework for the calculation of phonons in nanostructures with cyclic and/or helical symmetry. In particular, we derive a cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted representation of the dynamical matrix at arbitrary phonon wavevectors within a variationally formulated, symmetry-adapted density functional perturbation theory framework. In so doing, we also derive the acoustic sum rules for cylindrical geometries, which include a rigid-body rotational mode in addition to the three translational modes. We implement the cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted formalism within a high-order finite-difference discretization. Using carbon nanotubes as representative systems, we demonstrate the accuracy of the framework through excellent agreement with periodic plane-wave results. We further apply the framework to compute the Young's and shear moduli of carbon nanotubes, as well as the scaling laws governing the dependence of ring and radial breathing mode phonon frequencies on nanotube diameter. The elastic moduli are found to be in agreement with previous density functional theory and experimental results, while the phonon scaling laws show qualitative agreement with previous atomistic simulations.

Title: Local Magnetometry from Measurement-Induced Dissipation
Authors: Rishith Reddy V, Parveen Kumar, Ankur Das
Abstract: Magnetic phases are commonly identified through macroscopic magnetization, yet many ordered states, including antiferromagnets and altermagnets, possess a vanishing net moment despite distinct local spin structure. We show that such an order can be accessed through the measurement-induced steady state of a single primary qubit locally coupled to a spin lattice. Using a controlled primary-ancillary qubit protocol, we derive analytically that the steady state \emph{encodes} a locally weighted exchange field in a signed observable that is linear in the weak-coupling regime. Numerical simulations demonstrate lattice-scale resolution of antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic textures and robustness against short-correlated noise. Our results establish measurement-induced dissipation as a resource for detecting magnetic order through microscopic structure rather than through global moments.

Title: Bayesian umbrella quadrature accelerates free-energy calculations across diverse molecular systems and processes
Authors: Eline K. Kempkes, Alberto Pérez de Alba Ortíz
Abstract: Biased sampling in molecular dynamics simulations overcomes timescale limitations and delivers free-energy landscapes, essential to understand complex atomistic phenomena. However, when applied across diverse systems and processes, biasing protocols often require time- and resource-consuming fine-tuning. In search for robustness, we boost a prominent biasing method, Umbrella Sampling. To estimate the value of an integral, i.e., the free energy, our Bayesian Umbrella Quadrature (BUQ) method iteratively selects gradient samples, i.e., bias locations, that most reduce the posterior integral variance based on a noise-tolerant Gaussian process model, which also effectively interpolates between samples. We validate the method for a conformational change in a small peptide, a water-to-ice phase transition, and a substitution chemical reaction; obtaining excellent accuracies and speedups. To ease adoption of this more automated and universal free-energy method, we interface BUQ with wide-spread simulation packages and share hyperparametrization guidelines.

Title: Universal Transport Theory for Paired Fractional Quantum Hall States in the Quantum Point Contact Geometry
Authors: Eslam Ahmed, Ryoi Ohashi, Hiroki Isobe, Kentaro Nomura, Yukio Tanaka
Abstract: Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states can be viewed as topological superconductors of composite fermions, supporting a charged chiral mode and $|\mathcal{C}_{cf}|$ neutral Majorana modes set by the Chern number $\mathcal{C}_{cf}$. Despite ongoing efforts, distinguishing the many competing paired phases remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a unified theory of charge transport across a quantum point contact (QPC) for general paired FQH states described by an $so(N)_1 \times u(1)$ conformal field theory. We derive the boundary effective action for an arbitrary number of Majorana fermions $N=|\mathcal{C}_{cf}|$ and develop a non-perturbative instanton approximation to describe tunneling processes. We establish a weak-strong duality relating strong quasiparticle tunneling to weak electron tunneling. We calculate the scaling dimensions of the tunneling operators and demonstrate that while the weak-coupling fixed point is generally unstable, the strong-coupling fixed point is stable for physically relevant filling fractions and number of Majorana fermions. These transport exponents provide a distinct experimental fingerprint to identify the topological phases of even-denominator FQH states.

Title: Forbidden second harmonics in centrosymmetric bilayer crystals
Authors: Haoning Tang, Zhitong Ding, Tianyi Ruan, Zeyu Hao, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Haozhe Wang, Ali Javey, Feng Wang, Yuan Cao
Abstract: Optical spectroscopy based on second-order nonlinearity is a critical technique for characterizing two-dimensional (2D) crystals as well as bioimaging and quantum optics. It is generally believed that second-harmonic generation (SHG) in centrosymmetric crystals, such as graphene and other bilayer 2D crystals, is negligible without externally breaking the inversion symmetry. Here, we show that with a new homodyne detection technique, we can apparently circumvent this symmetry-imposed constraint and observe robust SHG in pristine centrosymmetric crystals, without any symmetry-breaking field. With its exceptional sensitivity, we resolve polarization-resolved SHG in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), bilayer 2H-WSe$_2$, and remarkably, Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, allowing us to unambiguously identify the crystallographic orientation in these crystals via SHG for the first time. We also demonstrate that the new technique can be used to non-invasively detect uniaxial strain and optical geometric phase in these crystals. The observed SHG in our experiments is attributed to second-order nonlinearity in the quadrupole channel, which is controlled by the presence of the $C_2$ symmetry instead of the inversion symmetry. Our new technique expands the capability of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to encompass a large class of centrosymmetric materials that could never be measured before, and can be used for quantum sensing of moiré materials and twisted epitaxial films.

Title: Achieving Ultrahigh Resolution with High Efficiency: Optical Design of the 2D-RIXS Spectrometer at NanoTerasu BL02U
Authors: Jun Miyawaki
Abstract: A state-of-the-art Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) facility, composed of a dedicated beamline and a 2D-RIXS spectrometer, has been constructed and commissioned at BL02U in NanoTerasu, Japan. This paper reports the optical design and optimization of this spectrometer, aiming for an ultrahigh energy resolution of <10 meV in the soft X-ray range. Conventional RIXS spectrometers using monochromatic incident X-rays suffer from a severe trade-off between energy resolution and measurement efficiency, which makes achieving resolutions of <10 meV practically unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we adopted the $h\nu^2$ concept using dispersive incident X-rays, based on a comparative study. This approach decouples the energy resolution from the incident bandwidth. We estimate that our 2D-RIXS spectrometer improves efficiency by more than a factor of 10 compared to conventional spectrometers. The 2D-RIXS spectrometer has been successfully commissioned, demonstrating that sub-10 meV resolution measurement is achievable with practical throughput. While development continues towards the ultimate design resolution, the successful implementation validates the design strategy and offers a pathway for future high-performance RIXS instrumentation.

Title: Attention in Krylov Space
Authors: Zihao Qi, Christopher Earls
Abstract: The Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis formulates time evolution of operators through Lanczos coefficients. In practice, however, numerical instability and memory cost limit the number of coefficients that can be computed exactly. In response to these challenges, the standard approach relies on fitting early coefficients to asymptotic forms, but such procedures can miss subleading, history-dependent structures in the coefficients that subsequently affect reconstructed observables. In this work, we treat the Lanczos coefficients as a causal time sequence and introduce a transformer-based model to autoregressively predict future Lanczos coefficients from short prefixes. For both classical and quantum systems, our machine-learning model outperforms asymptotic fits, in both coefficient extrapolation and physical observable reconstruction, by achieving an order-of-magnitude reduction in error. Our model also transfers across system sizes: it can be trained on smaller systems and then be used to extrapolate coefficients on a larger system without retraining. By probing the learned attention patterns and performing targeted attention ablations, we identify which portions of the coefficient history are most influential for accurate forecasts.

Title: DataScribe: An AI-Native, Policy-Aligned Web Platform for Multi-Objective Materials Design and Discovery
Authors: Divyanshu Singh, Doguhan Sarıtürk, Cameron Lea, Md Shafiqul Islam, Raymundo Arroyave, Vahid Attari
Abstract: The acceleration of materials discovery requires digital platforms that go beyond data repositories to embed learning, optimization, and decision-making directly into research workflows. We introduce DataScribe, an AI-native, cloud-based materials discovery platform that unifies heterogeneous experimental and computational data through ontology-backed ingestion and machine-actionable knowledge graphs. The platform integrates FAIR-compliant metadata capture, schema and unit harmonization, uncertainty-aware surrogate modeling, and native multi-objective multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization, enabling closed-loop propose-measure-learn workflows across experimental and computational pipelines. DataScribe functions as an application-layer intelligence stack, coupling data governance, optimization, and explainability rather than treating them as downstream add-ons. We validate the platform through case studies in electrochemical materials and high-entropy alloys, demonstrating end-to-end data fusion, real-time optimization, and reproducible exploration of multi-objective trade spaces. By embedding optimization engines, machine learning, and unified access to public and private scientific data directly within the data infrastructure, and by supporting open, free use for academic and non-profit researchers, DataScribe functions as a general-purpose application-layer backbone for laboratories of any scale, including self-driving laboratories and geographically distributed materials acceleration platforms, with built-in support for performance, sustainability, and supply-chain-aware objectives.

Title: Disorder-Induced Coherence Enables Control of Wave Transport
Authors: Israel Kurtz, Yiming Huang, Zhou Shi, Azriel Z Genack
Abstract: Illuminating disordered samples with waveforms matched to transmission-matrix eigenchannels produces transmission ranging from complete to vanishing with strong variations in internal energy density, enabling the control of wave propagation for applications in imaging and communications. The origin of these departures from diffusive transport has remained a puzzle since phase coherence is rapidly lost due to scattering. We show here that coherence among waveguide modes grows with sample depth, shaping flux, energy density, and velocity in transmission eigenchannels throughout the sample.

Title: The Topological Origin of Bohm Resistivity in Magnetic Reconnection
Authors: Magnus F Ivarsen
Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta~\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, identifying magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.

Title: Dissipative ground-state preparation of a quantum spin chain on a trapped-ion quantum computer
Authors: Kazuhiro Seki, Yuta Kikuchi, Tomoya Hayata, Seiji Yunoki
Abstract: We demonstrate a dissipative protocol for ground-state preparation of a quantum spin chain on a trapped-ion quantum computer. As a first step, we derive a Kraus representation of a dissipation channel for the protocol recently proposed by Ding et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 033147 (2024)] that still holds for arbitrary temporal discretization steps, extending the analysis beyond the Lindblad dynamics regime. The protocol guarantees that the fidelity with the ground state monotonically increases (or remains unchanged) under repeated applications of the channel to an arbitrary initial state, provided that the ground state is the unique steady state of the dissipation channel. Using this framework, we implement dissipative ground-state preparation of a transverse-field Ising chain for up to 19 spins on the trapped-ion quantum computer Reimei provided by Quantinuum. Despite the presence of hardware noise, the dynamics consistently converges to a low-energy state far away from the maximally mixed state even when the corresponding quantum circuits contain as many as 4110 entangling gates, demonstrating the intrinsic robustness of the protocol. By applying zero-noise extrapolation, the resulting energy expectation values are systematically improved to agree with noiseless simulations within statistical uncertainties.

Title: Vacuum-dressed superconductivity in NbN observed in a high-$Q$ terahertz cavity
Authors: Hongjing Xu, Andrey Baydin, Qinyan Yi, I-Te Lu, Ningxu Zhu, T. Elijah Kritzell, Jacques Doumani, Dasom Kim, Fuyang Tay, Angel Rubio, Junichiro Kono
Abstract: Emerging theoretical frameworks suggest that physical properties of matter can be altered within an optical cavity by harnessing quantum vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations, even in the total absence of external driving fields. Among the most intriguing predictions is the potential to noninvasively manipulate superconductivity. Here, we experimentally observe modified superconductivity in niobium nitride (NbN) thin films within high-quality-factor ($Q$) terahertz cavities. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we characterize the NbN response both in free space and within a high-$Q$ photonic-crystal cavity. Our analysis reveals significant cavity-induced modifications to the optical conductivity. A theoretical model indicates that these changes originate from a substantial ($\sim13\,\%$) reduction in the superfluid density and a minor ($\sim2\,\%$) reduction in the superconducting gap, driven by cavity vacuum fluctuations. These results demonstrate a platform for engineering ground states via vacuum--matter coupling, opening frontiers in cavity materials science.

Title: A Preparation Nonstationarity Loophole in Superconducting-Qubit Bell Tests
Authors: Prosanta Pal, Shubhanshu Karoliya, Gargee Sharma, Ramakrishna Podila
Abstract: Bell or Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) tests on superconducting quantum processors are commonly interpreted under the assumption that repeated circuit executions sample a single, stationary preparation ensemble. Here we show that this assumption can be violated on contemporary hardware, with direct implications for the interpretation of observed Bell violations. We introduce an ensemble-divergence framework in which slow temporal drift of the preparation process induces context-dependent effective ensembles, even when measurement independence and locality are preserved. This leads to a relaxed Bell bound $|S| \le 2 + 6\delta_{\mathrm{ens}}$, where $\delta_{\mathrm{ens}}$ quantifies preparation nonstationarity. Because $\delta_{\mathrm{ens}}$ is not directly observable, we develop an operational witness $\delta_{\mathrm{op}}$ based on bin-resolved outcome statistics for fixed measurement channels. Using Pauli-axis measurements on IBM superconducting processors, we observe statistically significant operational drift that persists after full two-qubit readout mitigation, ruling out measurement artifacts. In contrast, drift extracted from CHSH-optimal measurements is eliminated by mitigation, demonstrating that such settings are unsuitable for diagnosing preparation nonstationarity. We further show that the observed Bell violations imply only modest ensemble divergences, comparable in scale to those required in Hall-type measurement-dependence models, but arising here solely from preparation drift combined with experimental scheduling. Our results identify a preparation-dependent loophole relevant to Bell tests on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and highlight the necessity of drift-aware protocols for reliable quantum certification.

Title: Bridging Elastic and Active Turbulence
Authors: Vedad Dzanica, Sumesh P. Thampi, Julia M. Yeomans
Abstract: Remarkably, even under negligible inertia, the addition of microstructural agents can generate chaotic flow fields. Such behavior can arise in polymer solutions, leading to elastic turbulence, or from active, self-driven particles, which generate active turbulence. Here, we demonstrate a close and hitherto unrecognized connection between these two classes of turbulence. Specifically, we reveal that their continuum descriptions are analogous at the macroscopic level, such that polymeric fluids can be interpreted as a deformable analogue of contractile active matter. Moreover, our numerical results for Kolmogorov flow demonstrate that the transition into the well-known traveling arrowhead structures in elastic turbulence is marked by the emergence of $\pm 1/2$ topological defects, long recognized as a defining feature of active turbulence, in the polymer director field. Importantly, these coherent structures originate from a transverse instability driven by activity-like gradients generated by anisotropically stretched, contractile polymers. At sufficiently strong activity, the system undergoes a transition into a flow-suppressed state characterized by weak polymer stretching and ordering, a behavior that can be explained by analogy with the spontaneous-flow transition observed in channel-confined active nematics.

Title: Large earthquakes follow highly unequal ones
Authors: Sudip Sarkar, Soumyajyoti Biswas
Abstract: It was conjectured for a long time that the tectonic plates are in a self-organized state of criticality and that the Gutenberg-Richter (power) law is a manifestation of that. It was recently shown that for a system near criticality, the inequality of their responses toward external driving could indicate proximity to the critical point. In this work, we show with numerical simulations and seismic data analysis that large earthquake events have a tendency to follow events that are highly unequal. We have applied this framework to various tectonically active regions, such as North America, Southern Japan, parts of South-East Asia and Indonesia.

Title: Optimal Discretization in Hour-Glass Molecular Clocks Driven by Oscillating Free Energy
Authors: Zhuangcheng Zhen, Kaiyue Shi, Qi Ouyang, Yuansheng Cao
Abstract: Hour-glass clocks do not free-run; they keep time by riding an external rhythm. Motivated by the primordial KaiBC system in cyanobacteria, we study a driven, finite-state molecular clock that advances through a small number of biochemical states under an intrinsic driving energy and a rotating energy landscape set by day-night metabolism. In the continuum limit, coherence is maximized at a resonant operating point where the intrinsic drift matches the driving frequency. In realistic clocks with a finite number of states, discreteness matters: as the rotating landscape sweeps over a lattice of states, it generates a small and high frequency vibration of the collective phase that makes timing inaccurate. Combining the resonant cost with this discreteness penalty yields a trade-off in the number of states: few states are energetically cheap but noisy; many states are precise but costly. The optimum lies at moderate discretization (typically five to fifteen states) and an environmental coupling that is strong enough for responsiveness yet weak enough to avoid large discrete-state vibrations. These design rules rationalize why KaiC's hexameric architecture falls near the predicted optimum and suggest a general principle for hour-glass clocks across organisms.

Title: Excitonic Landscape of Monolayer Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides: Experimental Discrepancies, Theoretical Advances, and Strain Dependence
Authors: Cem Sevik, Purushothaman Manivannan, Fulvio Paleari, Milorad V. Milosevic
Abstract: Excitons in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered significant attention because of their large binding energies due to weakly screened Coulomb interaction, and direct bandgap at the K/K$^\prime$ point in the hexagonal Brillouin zone featuring spin-polarised bands due to spin-orbit coupling and lack of inversion symmetry. This makes them prospective for next-generation optoelectronic and quantum devices. However, despite the intense research activity, the reported values for exciton binding energies, quasiparticle gaps, and spectral features exhibit substantial variation across both experimental and theoretical studies. In this article, we present a comprehensive and critical assessment of the current understanding of excitonic properties in single-layer TMDs, integrating results from the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), photoluminescence (PL) measurements, and other experimental techniques with first-principles theoretical insights. Special emphasis is placed on the comparison and reconciliation of discrepancies observed across different experimental setups and sample qualities. Furthermore, we highlight our state-of-the-art GW-BSE calculations, which include both equilibrium and laterally strained systems, to systematically analyse the behaviour of direct and indirect excitons. By evaluating the effect of strain as a tunable control variable, we demonstrate its potential to engineer excitonic properties, supported by cross-validation against prior theoretical predictions and experimental findings. In doing so, we clarify the sources of discrepancies in the literature and offer a unified perspective on excited-state engineering strategies in two-dimensional TMDs.

Title: Application of the theory of C*-algebras to the emergence of hydrodynamics in quantum many-body systems
Authors: Dimitrios Ampelogiannis
Abstract: This Ph.D. thesis reports on progress in rigorously establishing hydrodynamic principles from the microscopic Hamiltonian dynamics of quantum many-body systems in a general, non-model-specific manner. Using the C*-algebra framework of statistical mechanics, we treat systems directly in the thermodynamic limit, primarily focusing on quantum lattice models where tools such as Lieb-Robinson bounds yield rigorous statements. We thus provide a proof-of-principle that large-scale behaviours can indeed be seen as emerging from microscopic dynamics, with mathematical proof. We first report on ergodicity results in short-range models with exponentially decaying or finite-range interactions. We show that time-averaged observables converge to their ensemble averages and decorrelate from all other observables almost everywhere within the light-cone defined by Lieb-Robinson bounds. This relaxation property indicates the loss of information at large scales, from which we prove a Boltzmann-Gibbs principle: at the Euler scaling limit of large time and distance, observables project onto hydrodynamic modes (extensive conserved quantities), within correlation functions. These results hold independently of microscopic details, capturing the physical idea that such details are lost at large space-time scales. Regarding finer scales of hydrodynamics, we discuss rigorous lower bounds on the strength of diffusion. We establish a general result on the clustering of n-th order connected correlations within C* dynamical systems. These results are applied to obtain a strictly positive lower bound on the diffusion constant of chaotic open quantum spin chains with nearest-neighbor interactions. This thesis underlines the universality of hydrodynamic principles, provides a framework for establishing them rigorously, and sets the stage for future progress toward the goal of proving the hydrodynamic equations.

Title: Open quantum spin chains with non-reciprocity: a theoretical approach based on the time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble
Authors: Alice Marché, Hironobu Yoshida, Alberto Nardin, Hosho Katsura, Leonardo Mazza
Abstract: We study an open quantum spin chain with non-reciprocal dissipation using a theoretical approach known as time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble. In the regime of weak dissipation the system is fully characterized by its rapidity distribution and we derive a closed set of coupled differential equations governing their time evolution. We check the accuracy of this theory by benchmarking the results against numerical simulations. Using this framework we are able to compute both the magnetization density and current dynamics, identifying some relations between the two. The problem of the anomalous power-law exponents identified in a previous work is discussed. Our work constitutes a theoretical approach that is able to describe the physics of non-reciprocal open quantum spin chains beyond analyses based on non-interacting fermions.

Title: Collapse of statistical equilibrium in large-scale hydroelastic turbulent waves
Authors: Marlone Vernet, Eric Falcon
Abstract: At scales larger than the forcing scale, some out-of-equilibrium turbulent systems (such as hydrodynamic turbulence, wave turbulence, and nonlinear optics) exhibit a state of statistical equilibrium where energy is equipartitioned among large-scale modes, in line with the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. Key open questions now pertain to either the emergence, decay, collapse, or other nonstationary evolutions from this state. Here, we experimentally investigate the free decay of large-scale hydroelastic turbulent waves, initially in a regime of statistical equilibrium. Using space- and time-resolved measurements, we show that the total energy of these large-scale tensional waves decays as a power law in time. We derive an energy decay law from the theoretical initial equilibrium spectrum and the linear viscous damping, as no net energy flux is carried. Our prediction then shows a good agreement with experimental data over nearly two decades in time, for various initial effective temperatures of the statistical equilibrium state. We further identify the dissipation mechanism and confirm it experimentally. Our approach could be applied to other decaying turbulence systems, with the large scales initially in statistical equilibrium.

Title: Magnetic fluctuations and superconducting pairing in $\varepsilon$-iron
Authors: A. S. Belozerov, A. A. Katanin, V. Yu. Irkhin, V. I. Anisimov
Abstract: We study Coulomb correlation effects and their role in superconductivity of $\varepsilon$-iron under pressure from 12 to 33 GPa by using a combination of density functional and dynamical mean-field theory. Our results indicate a persistence of the Fermi-liquid behavior below the temperature $\sim$1000 K. The Coulomb correlations are found to substantially renormalize the density of states, reducing the distance from the peak to the Fermi level to 0.4 eV compared to 0.75 eV obtained in DFT calculations. We find significant antiferromagnetic correlations, which are accompanied by the formation of short-lived local magnetic moments. We use the obtained results as a starting point for construction of the multi-band Bethe-Salpeter equation, which eigenvalues indicate that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations may result in the superconducting pairing in $\varepsilon$-Fe. Moreover, the tendency to superconducting instability becomes weaker with the increase of pressure, which may explain the disappearance of superconductivity at $\sim$30 GPa.

Title: Multimode Objective Lens for Momentum Microscopy and XPEEM: Experiments

Odnodvorets, Y. Mairesse, T.-L. Lee, A. Kunin, K. Rossnagel, Z. X. Shen, H.-J. Elmers, S. Beaulieu, G. Schönhense
Abstract: A new type of objective lens has recently been proposed for use in X-ray photoemission electron microscopes (XPEEMs) and momentum microscopes. Adding a ring electrode concentric with the extractor allows the field in the gap between the sample and the extractor to be shaped. Forming a lens field in this gap reduces the field strength at the sample by up to an order of magnitude. This mitigates the risk of field emission, particularly for cleaved samples with sharp edges. A retarding field can redirect all slow electrons, thus eliminating the primary contribution to the space-charge interaction. Here we present the first experimental investigation of the new lens, examining its performance at photon energies ranging from the extreme ultraviolet produced by a high-harmonic generation (HHG)-based source to soft and hard X-rays at two synchrotron facilities. The gap lens in a region without electrodes enables large working distances up to 23 mm. Reduced aberrations allow for larger fields of view in both k-space and real-space imaging, with resolutions comparable to those of conventional cathode lenses. However, field strengths are an order of magnitude smaller. The zero-field mode enables the study of 3D structured objects and is therefore beneficial for small cleaved samples as well as for operando devices involving top electrodes. The repeller mode reduces space-charge effects, but results in a smaller k-field diameter. This reduction ranges from 10% at hard X-ray energies to 50% in the XUV range. The usable energy interval is also reduced by a factor of two. In time-of-flight XPEEM mode the raw data show a resolution of 250 nm, which can be improved to better than 100 nm through data processing.

Title: Mechanical Interactions Govern Self-Organized Ordering in Bacterial Colonies on Surfaces
Authors: Samaneh Rahbar, Ludger Santen, Reza Shaebani
Abstract: Bacterial colonies growing on surfaces are shaped by mechanical stresses transmitted through the community, governed by the balance between cell growth and steric and cell-substrate interactions. Using overdamped dynamics simulations of nonmotile, stress-responsive bacteria, we examine how purely mechanical interactions determine colony morphology and internal organization. Growth-induced extensile stresses compete with steric constraints, giving rise to the spontaneous formation of microdomains composed of highly aligned cells. We characterize this self-organization through the distribution of microdomain areas and a nematic order parameter that quantifies colony-wide alignment. Mechanosensitivity does not systematically alter domain structure, but increasing substrate friction reduces the mean domain size and broadens the diversity of orientations. Shifting the balance toward steric interactions, by lengthening the cell division size, slows the relaxation of colony shape toward isotropy and broadens the distribution of contact forces, producing a slower exponential decay. In dense colonies, strong forces are transmitted anisotropically through chains of aligned neighbors within microdomains. These findings demonstrate that colony-level morphology and stress organization can emerge from local mechanical interactions alone, even without requiring biochemical signaling. By linking microscopic force transmission to macroscopic growth dynamics, our study provides a physical framework for understanding how mechanical interactions shape the self-organization of bacterial communities under surface confinement.

Title: Chiral superconductivity from parent Chern band and its non-Abelian generalization
Authors: Yan-Qi Wang, Zhi-Qiang Gao, Hui Yang
Abstract: We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose--Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose--Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. The chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion becomes the nonabelian Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. We argue that a chiral (pseudo-)spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of this Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.

Title: Chemical master equation parameter exploration using DMRG
Authors: John P. Zima, Schuyler B. Nicholson, Todd R. Gingrich
Abstract: Well-mixed chemical reaction networks (CRNs) contain many distinct chemical species with copy numbers that fluctuate in correlated ways. While those correlations are typically monitored via Monte Carlo sampling of stochastic trajectories, there is interest in systematically approximating the joint distribution over the exponentially large number of possible microstates using tensor networks or tensor trains. We exploit the tensor network strategy to determine when the steady state of a seven-species gene toggle switch CRN model supports bistability as a function of two decomposition rates, both parameters of the kinetic model. We highlight how the tensor network solution captures the effects of stochastic fluctuations, going beyond mean field and indeed deviating meaningfully from a mean-field analysis. The work furthermore develops and demonstrates several technical advances that will allow steady-states of broad classes of CRNs to be computed in a manner conducive to parameter exploration. We show that the steady-state distributions can be computed via the ordinary density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm despite having a non-Hermitian rate operator with a small spectral gap, we illustrate how that steady-state distribution can be efficiently projected to an order parameter that identifies bimodality, and we employ excited-state DMRG to calculate a relaxation timescale for the bistability.

Title: Mutual Multilinearity of Nonequilibrium Network Currents
Authors: Sara Dal Cengio, Pedro E. Harunari, Vivien Lecomte, Matteo Polettini
Abstract: Continuous-time Markov chains have been successful in modelling systems across numerous fields, with currents being fundamental entities that describe the flows of energy, particles, individuals, chemical species, information, or other quantities. They apply to systems described by agents transitioning between vertices along the edges of a network (at some rate in each direction). It has recently been shown by the authors that, at stationarity, a hidden linearity exists between currents that flow along edges: if one controls the current of a specific "input" edge (by tuning transition rates along it), any other current is a linear-affine function of the input current [PRL 133, 047401 (2024)]. In this paper, we extend this result to the situation where one controls the currents of several edges, and prove that other currents are in linear-affine relation with the input ones. Two proofs with distinct insights are provided: the first relies on Kirchhoff's current law and reduces the input set inductively through graph analysis, while the second utilizes the resolvent approach via a Laplace transform in time. We obtain explicit expressions for the current-to-current susceptibilities, which allow one to map current dependencies through the network. We also verify from our expression that Kirchhoff's current law is recovered as a limiting case of our mutual linearity. Last, we uncover that susceptibilities can be obtained from fluctuations when the reference system is originally at equilibrium.

Title: Time-domain extreme ultraviolet diffuse scattering spectroscopy of nanoscale surface phonons

Abstract: We report the observation of dynamic fringe patterns in the diffuse scattering of extreme ultraviolet light from surfaces, following femtosecond optical excitation. At each point on the detector, the diffuse scattering intensity exhibits oscillations at well-defined frequencies that correspond to surface phonons with wave vectors determined by the scattering geometry, indicating that the optical excitation generates coherent surface phonons propagating in all directions and spanning a wavelength range from 60 to 300 nm. This phenomenon is observed on a variety of samples, including single-layer and multilayer metal films, as well as bulk semiconductors. The measured surface phonon dispersions show good agreement with theoretical calculations. By comparing signal amplitudes from samples with different surface morphologies, we find that the excitation mechanism is linked to the natural surface roughness of the samples. However, the signal is still detectable on extremely smooth surfaces with sub-nanometer roughness. Our findings demonstrate a simple and effective method for optically exciting coherent surface phonons with nanoscale wavelengths on a wide range of solid samples and establish a foundation for surface phonon spectroscopy in a wave vector range well beyond the limit of conventional surface Brillouin scattering.

Title: Stabilization of three-body resonances to bound states in a continuum
Authors: Lucas Happ, Pascal Naidon
Abstract: Three-body resonances are ubiquitous in quantum few-body physics and are characterized by a finite lifetime before decaying into continuum states of their composing subsystems. In this work we present a theoretical study on the possibility to stabilize three-body resonances to so-called bound states in a continuum: resonances with vanishing width that do not decay. Within a two-channel approach we unveil the underlying mechanism and show how the lifetime can be made infinitely long by a continuous tuning of system parameters. The validity of our theory is illustrated in two different examples: a mass-imbalanced system in one dimension and a system of three identical bosons in three dimensions, relevant to Efimov physics. Crucially, for the latter we find that one of the parameters that can be tuned to achieve a three-body bound state in a continuum is an external magnetic field, a common tunable variable in cold-atom experiments. Due to the generality of this stabilization effect, it is expected to be applicable to a wide range of unstable few-body systems, opening new perspectives for fundamental studies as well as technical applications.

Title: Revealing Superconducting Chiral Edge Modes via Resistance Distributions
Authors: Linghao Huang, Dongheng Qian, Jing Wang
Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states offers a promising route to realize topological superconductivity with chiral Majorana edge modes. However, the definitive identification of these modes is challenging. Here we propose detecting superconducting chiral edge modes via the probability distribution of the resistance, or equivalently the charge transmission of QAH-superconductor heterojunctions. Remarkably, the distribution for coherent edge exhibits distinct characteristics for different topological superconducting phases in sufficiently long junctions, and this difference remains robust against weak decoherence. These findings provide insights into transport phenomena beyond the clean limit and highlight the resistance distribution as a compelling signature for distinguishing topological superconducting phases.

Title: Forces and symmetry breaking of a living meso-swimmer
Authors: Rafael A. Lara, N. Sharadhi, Anna A. L. Huttunen, Lotta Ansas, Ensio J. G. Rislakki, Guilherme M. Bessa, Matilda Backholm
Abstract: Swimming is ubiquitous in nature and crucial for the survival of a wide range of organisms. The physics of swimming at the viscosity-dominated microscale and inertia-dominated macroscale is well studied. However, in between lies a complicated mesoscale with swimmers affected by non-linear and time-dependent fluid mechanics. The intricate motility strategies, combined with complex and periodically changing body shapes add extra challenges for accurate meso-swimming modelling. Here, we have further developed the micropipette force sensor to directly probe the swimming forces of the meso-organism Artemia. Through deep neural network-based image analysis, we show how Artemia achieves an increased propulsive force by increasing its level of time-reversal symmetry breaking. We present a universal force-based scaling law for a wide range of micro- to meso-organisms with different body shapes, swimming strategies, and level of inertia at the mesoscale. These results capture fundamental aspects of biological meso-swimming dynamics and provide guidance for future biomimicking meso-robot designs.

Title: Magnetic ground state of a Jeff = 1/2 based frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet
Authors: M. Barik, J. Khatua, Suyoung Kim, Eundeok Mun, Suheon Lee, Bassam Hitti, Gerald D. Morris, Kwang-Yong Choi, P. Khuntia
Abstract: The subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom, crystal electric fields, and spin correlations can lead to exotic quantum states in 4f ion-based frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnets. We present the crystal structure, thermodynamic and muon spin relaxation ({\mu}SR) studies of the 4f ion-based frustrated magnet Ba4YbReWO12, wherein Yb3+ ions constitute a triangular lattice. The magnetic susceptibility does not show any signature of spin freezing down to 1.9 K or long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.4 K. The low-temperature Curie-Weiss fit to the inverse magnetic susceptibility data reveals a weak antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, which is corroborated by the fit of magnetic specific heat data following the J1-J2 model with the nearest neighbor exchange interaction of J1 = -0.197 K between the Jeff = 1/2 states of the Yb3+ moments in the lowest Kramers doublet. The lowest Kramers ground state doublet is well separated from the first excited state with a gap of 278 K, as evidenced by our {\mu}SR experiments that support the realization of Jeff = 1/2 at low temperatures. The specific heat experiments do not detect a phase transition down to 56 mK. The magnetic specific heat shows a broad maximum 90 mK suggesting a disordered ground state with short range spin correlations. The associated magnetic entropy release at low temperatures is consistent with that expected for the Jeff = 1/2 state. The zero-field {\mu}SR measurements show neither the signature of spin freezing nor a phase transition, at least down to 43 mK. Our results suggest a dynamic, disordered ground state in this Jeff = 1/2 frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet. Ba4RReWO12 (R=rare earth) offers a viable platform to realize intriguing quantum states borne out of spin-orbit coupling and frustration

Abstract: A thorough spectroscopic characterisation of highly hydrogenated monolayer graphene transferred on nickel grids is herein reported. The hydrogen bonding was found to be favoured for a more distorted graphene lattice. With X ray photoemission spectroscopy on the C 1s core-level, a 100$\%$ $sp^3$ distortion was observed after the hydrogenation of a more $sp^3$-like defected graphene, while a flatter, more $sp^2$-arranged, graphene reached a 62$\%$ $sp^3$ saturation. Electron energy loss spectroscopy showed the $\pi$-plasmon excitation quenching for the 100$\%$ $sp^3$ sample and a significant reduction for the other one. The high loading levels of hydrogenation led to the opening of a wide optical band gap (6.3 and 6.2 eV). The C-H stretching vibrational mode was also observed, as a direct footprint of graphene hydrogenation. Finally, valence band measurements of the 62$\%$ saturated sample suggest the coexistence of one-side and two-side hydrogenation morphologies.

Title: Rare Trajectories in a Prototypical Mean-field Disordered Model: Insights into Landscape and Instantons
Authors: Patrick Charbonneau, Giampaolo Folena, Enrico M. Malatesta, Tommaso Rizzo, Francesco Zamponi
Abstract: For disordered systems within the random first-order transition (RFOT) universality class, such as structural glasses and certain spin glasses, the role played by activated relaxation processes is rich to the point of perplexity. Over the last decades, various efforts have attempted to formalize and systematize such processes in terms of instantons similar to the nucleation droplets of first-order phase transitions. In particular, Kirkpatrick, Thirumalai, and Wolynes proposed in the late '80s an influential nucleation theory of relaxation in structural glasses. Already within this picture, however, the resulting structures are far from the compact objects expected from the classical droplet description. In addition, an altogether different type of single-particle hopping-like instantons has recently been isolated in molecular simulations. Landscape studies of mean-field spin glass models have further revealed that simple saddle crossing does not capture relaxation in these systems. We present here a landscape-agnostic study of rare dynamical events, which delineates the richness of instantons in these systems. Our work not only captures the structure of metastable states, but also identifies the point of irreversibility, beyond which activated relaxation processes become a fait accompli. An interpretation of the associated landscape features is articulated, thus charting a path toward a complete understanding of RFOT instantons.

Title: Interferometric evidence of non-volatile anomalous phase shifts in exchange-spin-split Josephson supercurrent diodes
Authors: Kun-Rok Jeon, Jae-Keun Kim, Jiho Yoon, Jae-Chun Jeon, Hyeon Han, Audrey Cottet, Takis Kontos, Stuart S. P. Parkin
Abstract: The recent realization of zero-field, polarity-reversible supercurrent rectification in proximity-magnetized Rashba-type Pt Josephson junctions (JJs) enables the development of superconducting logic circuits and cryogenic memory applications. Here, we demonstrate a non-volatile anomalous phase shift {\phi}_0 directly probed via superconducting quantum interferometry, providing phase-sensitive evidence of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking in these Rashba-type systems. By replacing the Pt barrier with 5d or 4d element layers exhibiting different (para-)magnetic susceptibilities, spin-orbit coupling strengths, and electronic band structures, we elucidate the role of proximity effects in governing zero-field diode behavior. Ta (W) JJs exhibit zero-field diode efficiencies of ~17% (~5%) at 2 K, which are slightly (significantly) lower than those of Pt JJs. Notably, the diode polarity in Ta and W JJs is reversed relative to Pt JJs. Combined with the large zero-field diode efficiency (~15% at 2 K) observed in highly magnetic-susceptible Pd JJs, these results show that non-volatile {\phi}_0 and, consequently, zero-field diode performance can be tuned through proximity engineering of interfacial magnetic ordering and Rashba spin-orbit interaction.

Title: Screened superexchange mechanism for superconductivity applied to cuprates
Authors: Patrick Navez
Abstract: In 1965, Kohn and Luttinger published a note revealing that dynamical screening of the repulsive Coulomb interaction leads under certain conditions to an effective attraction necessary for the formation of Cooper pairs. We propose such a formalism adapted to the cuprates where the screening arises from the superexchange dynamics of virtual holes in the oxygen orbitals of the $Cu O_2$ plane. Using an adequate Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, the basic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) method and the {\it ab initio} data on orbitals (energy, hopping, interaction), we derive some predictions for the temperature-doping phase diagram (pseudo-gap, strange metal, antiferromagnetism, superconducting and normal states) and for the doping dependant band energy spectrum in semi-quantitative agreement with observations.

Title: Universal scaling of microwave dissipation in superconducting circuits
Authors: Thibault Charpentier, Anton Khvalyuk, Lev Ioffe, Mikhail Feigel'man, Nicolas Roch, Benjamin Sacépé
Abstract: Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries, from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the superconducting gap. Our findings identify an empirical coherence limit associated with intrinsic material properties and provide a data-driven basis for materials selection in future superconducting quantum circuits.

Title: Symmetry re-breaking in an effective theory of quantum coarsening
Authors: Federico Balducci, Anushya Chandran, Roderich Moessner
Abstract: We present a simple theory accounting for two central observations in a recent experiment on quantum coarsening and collective dynamics on a programmable quantum simulator [T. Manovitz et al., Nature \textbf{638}, 86 (2025)]: an apparent speeding up of the coarsening process as the phase transition is approached; and persistent oscillations of the order parameter after quenches within the ordered phase. Our theory, based on the Hamiltonian structure of the equations of motion in the classical limit of the quantum model, finds a speeding up already deep within the ordered phase, with subsequent slowing down as the domain wall tension vanishes upon approaching the critical line. Further, the oscillations are captured within a mean-field treatment of the order parameter field. For quenches within the ordered phase, small spatially-varying fluctuations in the initial mean-field lead to a remarkable long-time effect, wherein the system dynamically destroys its long-range order and has to coarsen to re-establish it. We term this phenomenon \emph{symmetry re-breaking}, as the resulting late-time magnetization can have a sign opposite to the initial magnetization.

Title: Twist-angle tunable Josephson junctions in three-dimensional superconductors
Authors: Tenta Tani, Takuto Kawakami, Mikito Koshino
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the superconducting phase and perpendicular Josephson supercurrent in twisted three-dimensional (3D) superconductors, where two layered 3D materials are stacked with a relative twist. We formulate the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and develop a self-consistent method to calculate the superconducting order parameter and the resulting supercurrent. Applying this framework to a toy model with Fermi surfaces located near the Brillouin zone corners, we demonstrate a phase discontinuity at the twisted interface, indicating that a Josephson junction is formed purely by the twist. Our calculations reveal that the interface supports a finite critical current even when the Fermi surfaces of the two superconductors are completely separated, unlike in the case of a twisted normal-metal interface. We further show that the critical current can be effectively controlled by the twist angle, transitioning from a high-transparency regime at small angles to a low-transparency regime at larger angles.

Title: Direct measurement of the attractive electrosolvation force between a pair of colloidal particles
Authors: Sida Wang, Angela Le, Rowan Walker-Gibbons, Madhavi Krishnan
Abstract: In solution, electrically like-charged particles can experience a strong and long-ranged attraction that leads to the formation of stable, slowly reorganizing clusters. The attractive force underpinning this spontaneous organization process has been shown to depend on both the sign of charge of the particle and the nature of the solvent medium. The origin of the attraction has been ascribed to the preferential orientation of solvent molecules at the object-electrolyte interface. Here, we use optical imaging to directly measure the spatial profile of the potential of mean force between isolated pairs of charged microspheres. Working with particles carrying a variety of surface chemistries we find that the range of the electrosolvation attraction is substantially longer than previously held. In particular we show that particles carrying strongly anionic surface coatings composed of DNA or phospholipid bilayers display long-range attraction. We further find that the length scale governing the decay of the attractive force can depend on the properties of the interacting particles. This contrasts with the canonical expectation that the screening length governing the interaction of charged particles in solution depends exclusively on the properties of the intervening electrolyte medium. The observations point to significant departures from current thinking, and the likely need for a model of interactions that accounts for the molecular nature of the solvent, its interfacial behaviour, and spatial correlations. Finally, a strong and long-ranged attraction mediated by anionic matter constituting lipid membranes and chromatin could carry far-reaching implications for biological organization and structure formation.

Title: Single-orientation Crystalline Domains of Active Brownian Particles Lead to Collective Motions
Authors: Cheng Yang, Qiandong Dai, Shun Xu, Xin Zhou
Abstract: Active Brownian particles, even without attractive and anisotropic inter-particle interactions, can form a high-density phase featuring structure-ordered domains as well as collective motion regions under thermal noise. However, the mechanism, particularly the relationship between the motion and structure, remains unclear. In this study, we show that the motion-correlation regions are spatially coincident with the single-orientation crystalline domains. Each domain translates or rotates as a whole due to the net active force or torque acting upon it, allowing relative motions between these crystalline domains. The particles at domain boundaries usually have the active forces pointing inward, which helps to stabilize these structure-ordered domains and their corresponding collective motion regions.

Title: Role of Ward-Takahashi identity in an electron-phonon coupled system -- Revisiting phonon shift current
Authors: Takahiro Morimoto, Naoto Nagaosa
Abstract: We study bulk photovoltaic effects in electron-phonon coupled systems. The conservation of current or gauge invariance, manifested as the Ward-Takahashi identity, plays an essential role in the analysis of the Feynman diagrams, and the leading order contribution to the phonon shift current is identified accordingly. The leading order contribution essentially arises from the electric polarization carried by optically excited phonons, where the shift current is generated due to a change of electric polarization in the steady state under the optical excitation of phonons.

Title: Dynamic structure factor of quantum hard rods from exact form-factors
Authors: Stanisław Kiedrzyński, Emilia Witkowska, Miłosz Panfil
Abstract: We study the quantum hard-rods model and obtain compact analytical expressions for density form factors, and a semi-analytical treatment for dynamic and static structure factors calculations, greatly reducing computational complexity. We identify conditions under which these form factors vanish and analyze real-space correlations, confirming the model's Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior. The results reveal universal features of low energy physics of a gapless quantum fluid and its relation to Luttinger liquid theory, providing precise benchmarks for numerical simulations. This work establishes quantum hard rods as an important testbed for theories of strongly correlated one-dimensional systems.

Title: Tailored Thermal Transport in Phase Change Materials-Based Nanocomposites through Interfacial Structuring
Authors: Viktor Mandrolko, Mykola Isaiev
Abstract: Interfacial thermal transport is a critical bottleneck in nanoscale systems, where heat dissipation and energy efficiency are strongly modulated by molecular ordering at solid-liquid boundaries. Here, using atomistic simulations of hexadecane confined by structured silica substrates, we reveal how interfacial geometry, specifically curvature, governs the density distribution and thermal transport across the interface. On flat and mildly curved surfaces, the liquid exhibits surface-templated layering, promoting efficient heat transfer, which is enhanced as the contact surface area increases. As curvature increases, this ordering breaks down, giving rise to interference-like density patterns, reduced molecular packing, and localized depletion zones. This structural reorganization leads to a systematic increase of up to 10 % in interfacial thermal resistance (ITR), even when the contact area is kept constant. By decomposing the interface into convex ("hills" of the solid) and concave ("valleys" of the solid) regions, we find that valleys consistently exhibit lower ITR. In contrast, hills act as bottlenecks to heat flow, leading to interfacial thermal resistance values up to 70% higher than those of valleys, depending on the surface configuration. Remarkably, we show that the work of adhesion and entropy-related energy gain upon liquid detachment scale non-trivially with curvature: while adhesion increases with contact area from 30 mJ*m^(-2) for a flat surface to 40 mJ*m^(-2) for a maximum curvaceous surface, the entropic penalty dominates the total energy change, reflecting curvature-induced frustration of molecular alignment.

Title: Quenched properties of the Spectral Form Factor
Authors: Dimitrios Charamis, Manas Kulkarni, Jorge Kurchan, Laura Foini
Abstract: The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.

Title: Selective reflection of light in glassforming ternary liquid crystalline mixtures
Authors: Aleksandra Deptuch, Zuzanna Zając, Marcin Piwowarczyk, Anna Drzewicz, Marcin Kozieł, Magdalena Urbańska, Ewa Juszyńska-Gałązka
Abstract: Two ternary liquid crystalline mixtures are formulated and investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and broadband dielectric spectroscopy. Paraelectric smectic A*, ferroelectric smectic C*, and antiferroelectric smectic C$_A$* phases are detected. The glass of the smectic C$_A$* phase is formed at moderate cooling rates. Vitrification prevents the approaching transition to a hexatic smectic phase. One mixture shows a strong thermochromic effect in the smectic C$_A$* phase and selectively reflects blue light in the glassy state. Both mixtures reflect either green or red light in the smectic C* phase, depending on temperature treatment: whether the sample is cooled or heated, or at which rate the temperature changes.

Title: Cooperation, competition and emergence of hierarchy: reconfigurable assembly of active colloids under combined electric and magnetic fields
Authors: Indira Barros, Sayanth Ramachandran, Indrani Chakraborty
Abstract: Field induced assembly of reconfigurable structures with complex hierarchical configurations has recently become an area of intense research with the promise for exciting applications in programmable self-assembly and nano/microstructure fabrication. While a wide variety of structures, from crystals to glasses, to chains and oligomers have been produced by activating colloidal particles with electric and magnetic fields, a combined approach utilizing the capabilities of multiple field types offers a richer parameter space, enabling precise structural control and a higher degree of reconfigurability. Here we demonstrate the assembly of complex hierarchical colloidal superstructures using an electric field (AC) and magnetic field (DC) combination. In our chosen frequency regime, dipolar (magnetic and electric) and electrohydrodynamic interactions are comparable, leading to a rich phase space with a wide number of configurations which are tunable by relatively small changes of the field parameters. This is in contrast to the existing small number of studies on multi-field induced assembly that work in size and frequency regimes where the dominant mechanism is dipolar interaction induced assembly. We show that depending upon the direction and frequency of the applied fields, there can be three possibilities in structure formation: a) a cooperation among the fields b) a competition among the fields and c) hierarchical reorganization in which micrometer-sized particles form chains that are part of larger clusters or 'domains' spanning tens of micrometers. This versatile, easy to set up and fully reconfigurable approach of multi-field induced structure formation opens up new opportunities for bottom-up fabrication of smart materials, switchable photonic crystals, and modular microswimmers for targeted drug delivery and environmental remediation.

Title: Rogue waves in extended Gross-Pitaevskii Models with a Lee-Huang-Yang correction
Authors: Sathyanarayanan Chandramouli, Simeon I. Mistakidis, Garyfallia C. Katsimiga, Daniel J. Ratliff, Dimitrios J. Frantzeskakis, Panayotis G. Kevrekidis
Abstract: We explore the existence and dynamical generation of rogue waves (RWs) within a one dimensional quantum droplet bearing environment. RWs are computed by deploying a spacetime fixed point scheme to the relevant extended Gross Pitaevskii equation (eGPE). Parametric regions where the ensuing RWs are different from their counterparts in the nonlinear Schroedinger equation are identified. To corroborate the controllable generation, relevant to ultracold atom experiments, of these rogue patterns we exploit two different protocols. The first is based on interfering dam break flows emanating from Riemann initial conditions and the second refers to the gradient catastrophe of a spatially localized waveform. A multitude of possible RWs are found in this system, spanning waveforms reminiscent of the Peregrine soliton, its spatially periodic variants, namely, the Akhmediev breathers, and other higher order RW solutions of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Key elements of the shape of the corresponding eGPE RWs traced back to nonintegrability and the presence of competing interactions are discussed. Our results set the stage for probing a multitude of unexplored rogue like waveforms in such mixtures with competing interactions and should be accessible to current ultracold atom experiments.

Title: Ultrathin bismuth-yttrium iron garnet films with tunable magnetic anisotropy
Authors: Hanchen Wang, William Legrand, Davit Petrosyan, Min-Gu Kang, Emir Karadža, Hiroki Matsumoto, Richard Schlitz, Michaela Lammel, Myriam H. Aguirre, Pietro Gambardella
Abstract: We report on the epitaxial growth of nm-thick films of bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG) by high-temperature off-axis radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. We demonstrate accurate control of the magnetic properties by tuning of the sputtering parameters and epitaxial strain on various (111)-oriented garnet substrates. BiYIG films with up to -0.80\% lattice mismatch with the substrate remain fully strained up to 60~nm-thick, maintaining a high crystalline quality. Transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm coherent epitaxial growth, the absence of defects, and limited interdiffusion at the BiYIG/substrate interface. Varying the tensile or compressive strain between -0.80\% and +0.56\% in BiYIG allows for accurate compensation of the total magnetic anisotropy through magneto-elastic coupling. The effective magnetic anisotropy of sputtered BiYIG films can be further tuned via the off-axis deposition angle and the oxygen flow during growth, which determine the cation stoichiometry. Under optimized growth conditions, a ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth of 1~mT at 10~GHz is reliably obtained even for thicknesses as low as 10~nm. We also report small FMR linewidths in ultrathin (2-5~nm) BiYIG films grown on diamagnetic substrate yttrium scandium gallium garnet. These findings highlight the promise of low-damping, strain-engineered nm-thick BiYIG films for implementing advanced functionalities in spin-orbitronic and magnonic devices. Specifically, the magnetic-anisotropy compensation and low damping enable large cone-angle magnetization dynamics immune to magnon-magnon nonlinear scattering.

Title: Ground-state phase diagram of S = 1/2 Heisenberg model on 2D square-hexagon-octagon lattice
Authors: Yumeng Luo, Yuehong Li, Mengfan Jiang, Muwei Wu, Jian-Jian Yang, Dao-Xin Yao, Han-Qing Wu
Abstract: Using stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo and density matrix renormalization group methods, we investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the two-dimensional square-hexagon-octagon (SHO) lattice. The model incorporates nearest-neighbor interactions $J_1$ (intrahexagon interaction) and $J_2$ (interhexagon), as well as a selected third-neighbor interaction $J_3$ along the $x$ direction. We identify five distinct phases in the parameter regime $0<\lambda_1=J_2/J_1<4, 0<\lambda_2=J_3/J_1<4$: a Néel antiferromagentic phase, two dimer phases (orthogonal and ladder staggered dimers), a hexagon singlet phase, and notably a Haldane-like symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. The topological nature of the Haldane-like phase is confirmed by the degeneracy of the ground-state energy under open boundary conditions and the twofold degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum. Phase boundaries are accurately determined using finite-size scaling of the spin stiffness and Binder cumulant. Data collapse analysis reveals that all transitions from nonmagnetic phases to the antiferromagnetic phase belong to the three-dimensional $O(3)$ Heisenberg universality class. In addition, we investigate the robustness of the SPT phase to other interactions, such as those that could arise in experimental materials. Our work establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding magnetic and topological phases on the SHO lattice.

Title: Generalized Finite-time Optimal Control Framework in Stochastic Thermodynamics
Authors: Atul Tanaji Mohite, Heiko Rieger
Abstract: Optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics are a frontier for understanding the control and design of non-equilibrium systems, with broad practical applications in biology, chemistry, and nanoscale/mesoscale systems. Optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry have emerged as optimal control methodology, but they are based on slow-driving and close to equilibrium assumptions. An optimal control framework in stochastic thermodynamics for finite time driving is still elusive. Therefore, we solve in this paper an optimal control problem for changing the control parameters of a discrete-state far-from-equilibrium process from an initial to a final value in finite-time. Optimal driving protocols are derived that minimize the total finite-time dissipation cost for the driving process. Our framework reveals that discontinuous endpoint jumps are a generic, model-independent physical mechanism that minimizes the optimal driving entropy production, whose importance is further amplified for far-from-equilibrium systems. The thermodynamic and dynamic physical interpretation and understanding of discontinuous endpoint jumps is formulated. An exact mapping between the finite-time to slow driving optimal control formulation is elucidated, developing the state-of-the-art of optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry, which has been the current paradigm for studying optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics that relies on slow driving assumptions. Our framework opens up a plethora of applications to the thermodynamically efficient control of a far-from-equilibrium system in finite-time, which opens up a way to their efficient design principles.

Title: Finding the stable mechanism of ring solitons in two-dimensional Fermi superfluids
Authors: Hao-Xuan Sun, Liu-Yang Cheng, Shi-Guo Peng, Yan-Qiang Li, Peng Zou
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the stable mechanism of a ring soliton in two-dimensional Fermi superfluids by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and their time-dependent counterparts. In the uniform situation, we discover that the ring soliton is always driven away from its initial location, and moves towards the edge due to a curvature-induced effective potential. The ring soliton is impossible to remain static at any location in the uniform system. To balance the density difference between the ring soliton's two sides, a harmonic trap is introduced, which can exert an effect to counterbalances the curvature-induced effective potential. This enables the ring dark soliton to become a stable state at a particular equilibrium position r_s, where the free energy of the ring dark soliton just reaches the maximum value. Once ring soliton is slightly deviated from r_s, some stable periodic oscillations of ring soliton around r_s will turn out. Some dissipation will possibly occur to ring soliton once its minimum radius is comparable to the healing length of soliton's Friedel oscillation. This dissipation will increase the oscillation amplitude and finally make the ring soliton decay into sound ripples. Our research lays the groundwork for a more in-depth understanding of the stable mechanism of a ring dark soliton in the future.

Title: Infinite-component $BF$ field theory: Nexus of fracton order, Toeplitz braiding, and non-Hermitian amplification
Authors: Bo-Xi Li, Peng Ye
Abstract: Building on the infinite-component Chern-Simons theory of three-dimensional fracton phases by Ma et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, 195124 (2022)] and the Toeplitz braiding of anyons by Li et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we show that stacking $(3+1)$D $BF$ topological field theories along a fourth spatial direction gives rise to an exotic class of four-dimensional fracton phases. Their low-energy physics is governed by a new field-theoretic framework -- infinite-component $BF$ (i$BF$) theories -- characterized by asymmetric integer Toeplitz $K$ matrices. Under open boundary conditions, i$BF$ theories exhibit a striking phenomenon: \textit{Toeplitz particle-loop braiding}, where a particle and a loop placed on opposite three-dimensional boundaries acquire a finite braiding phase even at infinite separation. This nonlocal braiding admits a geometric interpretation: transporting the particle induces a winding boundary trajectory on the opposite boundary that encircles the loop. We show that this robustness originates from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of Toeplitz $K$ matrices revealed by singular value decomposition (SVD), rather than from the eigenvalue zero modes responsible for previously known Toeplitz braiding of anyons. We analytically and numerically study representative i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger--type $K$ matrices, establishing a universal correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz particle-loop braiding. Our results identify boundary zero singular modes as the mechanism behind Toeplitz particle-loop braiding and establish infinite-component $BF$ theory as a predictive framework for higher-dimensional fracton topological orders.

Title: Control of Extraordinary Optical Transmission in Resonant Terahertz Gratings via Lateral Depletion in an AlGaN-GaN Heterostructure
Authors: Geofrey Nyabere, Hunter Ellis, Miguel Gomez, Wei Jia, Yizheng Liu, Karli Ann Higley, Sriram Krishnamoorthy, Steve Blair, Kai Fu, Berardi Sensale-Rodriguez
Abstract: Periodic metallic gratings on substrates can support a range of electromagnetic modes, such as leaky waveguide, guided-resonant, and Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity modes, which can strongly modulate optical transmission under resonant excitation. Here, we investigate how this coupling can be dynamically manipulated through charge-density control in a laterally patterned AlGaN/GaN heterostructure. The structure comprises metallic stripes separated by regions containing a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), forming a periodically modulated interface whose electromagnetic response is governed by the charge density between the stripes. In the unbiased state, the conductive 2DEG screens the incident terahertz field and suppresses excitation of guided modes. When the 2DEG is depleted, the change in boundary conditions allows efficient coupling into substrate resonances, producing a strong modulation at particular frequencies where extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) through the structure takes place. The results highlight the sensitive dependence of guided-mode-resonance (GMR) mediated EOT on inter-stripe charge distribution and demonstrate a direct interplay between carrier dynamics and resonant electromagnetic phenomena in the terahertz regime.

Title: On the uniqueness of the coupled entropy
Authors: Kenric P. Nelson
Abstract: The coupled entropy, $H_\kappa,$ is proven to uniquely satisfy the requirement that a generalized entropy be a measure of the uncertainty at the scale, $\sigma,$ for a class of non-exponential distributions. The coupled stretched exponential distributions, including the generalized Pareto and Student's t distributions, are uniquely parameterized to quantify linear uncertainty with the scale and nonlinear uncertainty with the tail shape for a broad class of complex systems. Thereby, the coupled entropy optimizes the representation of the uncertainty due to linear sources. Lemmas for the composability and extensivity of the coupled entropy are proven. The uniqueness of the coupled entropy is further supported by demonstrating consistent thermodynamic relationships, which correspond to a model used for the momentum of high-energy particle collisions. Applications of the coupled entropy in measuring statistical complexity, training variational inference algorithms, and designing communication channels are reviewed.

Title: Minimizing energy dissipation during programming of resistive switching memory devices using their dynamical attractor states
Authors: Valeriy A. Slipko, Alon Ascoli, Fernando Corinto, Yuriy V. Pershin
Abstract: Under certain conditions, applying a sequence of voltage pulses of alternating polarities across a resistive switching memory device induces a finite number of fixed-point attractors in its time-averaged dynamics, known as dynamical attractors. Remarkably, dynamical attractors can be used to program analog values into the device state without supervision. Because different pulse sequences can produce the same trajectory solution for the state in the phase space, there is strong potential for optimization, particularly regarding the energy cost of the programming phase, which this study addresses. The proposed theory-based energy minimization strategy is applied to the voltage threshold adaptive memristor (VTEAM) model, which is known for its predictive capability and adaptability in fitting a large number of resistive switching memory devices. The optimization design crafts ad-hoc pulse sequences that minimize the energy required to program the device into a desired dynamical attractor. The theoretical approach is also extended to cover situations where a fast programming scheme should be adopted to serve time-critical electronics applications.

Title: Spectral mechanism and nearly reducible transfer matrices for pseudotransitions in one-dimensional systems
Authors: Onofre Rojas
Abstract: While true phase transitions are forbidden in one-dimensional systems with short-range interactions, several models have recently been shown to exhibit sharp yet analytic thermodynamic anomalies that mimic thermal phase transitions. We show that this behavior arises from transfer matrices that are mathematically irreducible but possess a nearly block-diagonal structure due to the weak contribution of off-diagonal Boltzmann weights in the low-temperature regime. This results in weakly coupled competing sectors whose eigenvalue competition produces abrupt crossovers without nonanalyticity, a mechanism we term nearly block-diagonal irreducible. A key thermodynamic signature of such pseudotransitions is that the residual entropy at the interface remains bounded between the residual entropies of the competing sectors. We develop a general spectral framework to describe this behavior and apply it to two representative models: the Ising chain with internal degeneracy (Doniach model) and a hexagonal nanowire chain with mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 components. In the first case, we derive exact expressions for the pseudo-critical temperature and residual entropy. In the second, we reduce the full $1458\times1458$ transfer matrix via symmetry decomposition and construct a low-rank effective matrix that accurately captures the crossover between quasi-ferromagnetic and quasi-core-ferromagnetic regimes. Our results demonstrate that pseudotransitions can be understood as spectral phenomena emerging from irreducible but functionally decoupled structures within the transfer matrix.

Title: Structure factor realizability reveals the glass-dynamics onset temperature
Authors: Bowen Duan, Ge Zhang
Abstract: When liquids are cooled rapidly, they bypass crystallization and instead enter a supercooled state and then a glass state. Previous studies have shown that the static structure factors of high-temperature liquids, supercooled liquids, and glasses exhibit only subtle differences, leading to the conclusion that the glass transition cannot be predicted solely from structure factor changes. Our research challenges this limitation. Specifically, we studied the difficulty of generating configurations corresponding to target structure factors using stochastic gradient descent optimizations. While such optimizations easily converge when targeting the structure factors of higher temperature liquids, the difficulty significantly increases for lower temperature liquids and glasses. By quantifying this difficulty through the mean squared error achieved, we found a kink at the onset temperature of glass dynamics. Our results suggest that the onset of glass dynamics can be explained by a topological change in the realizability landscape of the structure factor, even though the structure factor itself only changes smoothly. Our results are currently based on computer simulations using original and modified Dzugutov interactions, and future work will determine whether our theory is applicable to other glass-forming systems.

Title: Stochastic Dynamics of Skyrmions on a Racetrack: Impact of Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Noise
Authors: Anton V. Hlushchenko, Mykhailo I. Bratchenko, Aleksei V. Chechkin
Abstract: Current-driven motion of domain walls and skyrmions is central to the operation of non-volatile magnetic memory devices. Racetrack memory requires current densities high enough to generate velocities above 50 m/s, but such conditions also enhance spin-current noise. We develop a theoretical framework based on the stochastic Thiele equation to analyze the effects of equilibrium (thermal) and nonequilibrium (spin-current) fluctuations on skyrmion dynamics. From this approach, we derive diffusion coefficients and mean-squared displacements that quantify stochastic motion under both noise sources. Micromagnetic simulations and analytical results demonstrate that spin-current noise dominates skyrmion dynamics in typical racetrack structures up to room temperature. We further address the first-passage-time problem, obtaining the mean first-passage time and its standard deviation along and across the racetrack. These results quantify how random displacements affect skyrmion propagation and detection, providing insights into error sources in high-speed racetrack memory devices.

Title: Response regimes in on-chip THz spectroscopy
Authors: Gunda Kipp, Marios H. Michael, Alexander M. Potts, Dorothee Herrmann, Toru Matsuyama, Guido Meier, Matthew W. Day, Hope M. Bretscher, James W. McIver
Abstract: On-chip THz spectroscopy enables quantitative measurements of the optical conductivity of sub-wavelength 2D materials by tightly confining THz fields in metallic transmission line structures interfaced to the material. However, because the probed structures are smaller than the THz wavelength, finite-size and environmental effects can strongly influence the measured response. Here, we identify the conditions under which a metallic sample exhibits a genuine Drude response and when finite-size and environmental effects must be considered. We further introduce and characterize an additional regime, the Phantom-Drude response, which mimics Drude behavior but instead originates from the superposition of multiple finite-momentum plasmonic resonances. If unrecognized, this regime can lead to misinterpretation of intrinsic material properties. We systematically show how the Phantom-Drude response can emerge and demonstrate its sensitivity to sample dimensions, transmission line geometry, material shape, and gate properties, providing practical guidelines to avoid this regime in future on-chip THz measurements.

Title: Disorder Suppression of Charge Density Wave in the Honeycomb Holstein Model
Authors: Guangchao Li, Lifei Zhang, Tianxing Ma, Qionglin Dai, Lufeng Zhang
Abstract: The formation of charge-density-wave order in Dirac fermion systems via electron-phonon coupling represents a significant topic in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon within the Holstein model on the honeycomb lattice, with a specific focus on the effect of disorder. While the interplay between electron-electron interactions and disorder has long been a central theme in the field, recent attention has increasingly turned to the combined influence of disorder and electron-phonon coupling. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \(\beta_c\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling. Additionally, we observed a suppression of electron kinetic energy and dc conductivity under disorder, highlighting the role of Anderson localization in the degradation of electronic transport. These findings offer significant theoretical insight into the stability and critical phenomena of correlated phases in disordered two-dimensional systems.

Title: Polaritonic Bloch's Theorem beyond the Long-Wavelength Approximation
Authors: Giovanna Bruno, Rosario Roberto Riso, Henrik Koch, Enrico Ronca
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics provides a powerful tool to manipulate material properties, yet it remains a matter of debate whether and how quantized fields affect the periodicity of crystals. Here, we extend Bloch's theorem to crystals under strong light-matter coupling, revealing that polariton quasiparticles preserve lattice periodicity. We introduce a general framework to incorporate multimode cavity fields in a simple and tractable way, showing that additional modes contribute small energy corrections noticeable only at low frequencies. Within the single-photon approximation, these contributions reduce to a spatially uniform effective field in the crystal plane, providing a formal justification for the single-mode and long-wavelength approximations commonly used in molecular polaritonics. Together, these results establish a rigorous framework for describing polaritonic states in crystalline solids.

Title: Optical Detection and Manipulation of Pseudospin Orders in Wigner Crystals
Authors: Yichen Dong, Eugene Demler, Zhiyuan Sun
Abstract: In Wigner-crystal states of two-dimensional electrons, the spin ordering remains poorly understood. The small energy differences between candidate spin orders make theoretical studies less reliable, and probing magnetic order at a nonzero wave vector is experimentally challenging. In modern realizations of Wigner crystals, the electronic spin degree of freedom is often replaced by a valley pseudospin associated with nonzero Berry curvature. The resulting anomalous velocity couples the electrons' pseudospin texture to their orbital vibration. We show that this mechanism enables optical detection of pseudospin orders in Wigner crystals by producing sharp signatures in the terahertz optical conductivity. For example, antiferromagnetic pseudospin order enables light to excite collective electronic vibrations at the ordering wave vector, generating a characteristic absorption peak. Based on the same principle, we further show that a strong optical drive generates an effective potential that reshapes the pseudospin energy landscape, inducing phase transitions to stripe antiferromagnetic states. These results point to a route for optical detection and control of spin order via its coupling to orbital motion.

Title: Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids
Authors: Subir Sachdev
Abstract: Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P.~W.~Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations: (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)). These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.

Title: Mixing, segregation, and collapse transitions of interacting copolymer rings
Authors: EJ Janse van Rensburg, E Orlandini, MC Tesi, SG Whittington
Abstract: A system of two self and mutual interacting ring polymers, close together in space, can display several competing equilibrium phases and phase transitions. Using Monte Carlo simulations and combinatorial arguments on a corresponding lattice model, we determine three equilibrium phases, two in which the rings segregate in space and are either extended (the segregated-expanded phase) or compact (the segregated-collapsed phase). The third is a mixed phase where the rings interpenetrate. The corresponding phase boundaries are located numerically and their critical nature is discussed. Finally, by looking at the topological properties of the three phases, we show that the two rings are likely to be linked in the mixed phase and knotted in the segregated-collapsed phase.

Title: Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses
Authors: Guglielmo Macrelli
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. This study investigates ion-exchange kinetics within silicate glasses, operating under the Nernst-Planck binary interdiffusion regime. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.

Abstract: Tantalum dioxide (TaO2) is a metastable tantalum compound. Here, we report the epitaxial stabilization of TaO2 on Al2O3 (1-102) (r-plane sapphire) substrates using suboxide molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) and thermal laser epitaxy (TLE), demonstrating single-oriented, monodomain growth of anisotropically strained thin films. Microstructural investigation is performed using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The tetravalent oxidation state of tantalum is confirmed using X-ray absorption and photoemission spectroscopy as well as electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Optical properties are investigated via spectroscopic ellipsometry and reveal a 0.3 eV Mott gap of the tantalum 5d electrons. Density-functional theory and group theoretical arguments are used to evaluate the limited stability of the rutile phase and reveal the potential to unlock a hidden metal-insulator transition concomitant with a structural phase transition to a distorted rutile phase, akin to NbO2. Our work expands the understanding of tantalum oxides and paves the way for their integration into next-generation electronic and photonic devices.

Title: Magnetic field decouples nodeless surface and nodal bulk orders in PdTe
Authors: Atanu Mishra, Ghulam Mohmad, Kiran Bansal, Mohd Monish, Pankaj Kumar, Chandrasekhar Yadav, Goutam Sheet
Abstract: Selective spectroscopic disentanglement of surface and bulk quantum orders remains an outstanding challenge in condensed matter physics. The candidate topological superconductor PdTe has recently been proposed to host a nodeless surface gap on top of a nodal bulk state, but their direct identification and mutual coupling remained experimentally elusive. Here, we employ magnetic-field-dependent Andreev reflection spectroscopy to spectroscopically disentangle these components. At zero magnetic field, the spectra exhibit a BCS-like gap structure, consistent with dominant transport through a fully gapped surface superconducting state. Strikingly, even a weak magnetic field leads to an abrupt suppression of the Andreev-enhanced conductance (AEC), while a residual AEC, attributable to the nodal bulk state, persists to much higher magnetic fields. The transition is accompanied by pronounced magnetic hysteresis pointing to the existence of vortex dynamics at low fields. Our findings suggest that the nodal bulk gap facilitates early vortex entry, which in turn disrupts the fragile surface superconductivity. These results establish a field-tunable decoupling of surface and bulk superconductivity and illustrate how distinct gap topologies can shape the global superconducting order in multichannel systems.

Title: Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivities in random site energy and associated random barrier model
Authors: Sven Lohmann, Quinn Emilia Fischer, Justus Leiber, Philipp Maass
Abstract: Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivity spectra in disordered solids has been explained by thermally activated hopping of noninteracting particles over random energy barriers. An open problem is whether the random barrier model accounts for site energy disorder in real materials. Through mapping many-particle hopping in a disordered site energy landscape to that of independent particles in a barrier landscape, we show that time-temperature scaling is correctly described by the associated barrier model in the low temperature limit. However, the site energy model displays good scaling behavior at substantially higher temperatures than the barrier model, in agreement with experimental observations. Extending the mapping to different types of mobile charge carriers allows us to understand why time-temperature superposition can be absent in mixed alkali glasses.

Title: Time-loops to spot torsion on bidimensional Dirac materials with dislocations
Authors: Alfredo Iorio, Pablo Pais
Abstract: Assuming that, with some care, dislocations could be meaningfully described by torsion, we propose here a scenario based on a previously unexplored role of time in the low-energy Dirac field theory description of two-space-dimensional Dirac materials. Our approach is based on the realization of an exotic time-loop that could be realized by oscillating particle-hole pairs, overcoming the well-known geometrical obstructions due to the lack of a third spatial dimension. General symmetry considerations allow concluding that the effects we are looking for can only be seen if we move to the nonlinear response regime.

Title: Magneto-optical-electric joint-measurement scanning imaging system for identification of two-dimensional vdW multiferroic
Authors: Yangliu Wu, Bo Peng
Abstract: As an advanced imaging system, the magneto-optical-electric joint-measurement scanning imaging system (MOEJSI) brings spectroscopic techniques with unmatched spatial resolution to very low temperature, high magnetic field and high electric field measurements. It was developed for investigating the magnetic and ferroelectric properties and their mutual control through magneto-optical-electric joint-measurements, besides Raman and photoluminescence features. In particular, the reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) loops and imaging, linear dichroism (LD) imaging and polarization-electric field hysteresis loop can be achieved when simultaneously applied high magnetic field (7 T) and electric field (100 V) at low temperature of 10 K.

Title: On the free energy of vector spin glasses with non-convex interactions
Authors: Hong-Bin Chen, Jean-Christophe Mourrat
Abstract: The limit free energy of spin-glass models with convex interactions can be represented as a variational problem involving an explicit functional. Models with non-convex interactions are much less well-understood, and simple variational formulas involving the same functional are known to be invalid in general. We show here that a slightly weaker property of the limit free energy does extend to non-convex models. Indeed, under the assumption that the limit free energy exists, we show that this limit can always be represented as a critical value of the said functional. Up to a small perturbation of the parameters defining the model, we also show that any subsequential limit of the law of the overlap matrix is a critical point of this functional. We believe that these results capture the fundamental conclusions of the non-rigorous replica method.

Title: Quantum theory of molecular orientations
Authors: Victor V. Albert, Eric Kubischta, Mikhail Lemeshko, Lee R. Liu
Abstract: We formulate a quantum phase space for rotational and nuclear-spin states of rigid molecules. For each nuclear spin isomer, we re-derive the isomer's admissible angular momentum states from molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, introduce its angular position states using quantization theory, and develop a generalized Fourier transform converting between the two. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We discuss two general features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, we quantify when and how an isomer's state space is completely rotation-spin entangled, meaning that it does not admit any separable states. Second, we identify isomers whose position states house an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline how the fiber can be used as a quantum error-correcting code and discuss scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed

Title: Classical periodic trajectories and quantum scars in many-spin systems
Authors: Igor Ermakov, Oleg Lychkovskiy, Boris V. Fine
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.

Title: On the phase diagram of the multiscale mean-field spin-glass
Authors: Francesco Camilli, Pierluigi Contucci, Emanuele Mingione, Daniele Tantari
Abstract: In this paper we study the phase diagram of a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model where the couplings are forced to thermalize at different time scales. Besides being a challenging generalization of the SK model, such settings may arise naturally in physics whenever part of the many degrees of freedom of a system relaxes to equilibrium considerably faster than the others. For this model we compute the asymptotic value of the second moment of the overlap distribution. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous sufficient condition for an annealed solution to hold, identifying a high temperature, or weak coupling, region. In addition, we also prove that for sufficiently strong couplings the solution must present a number of replica symmetry breaking levels at least equal to the number of time scales already present in the multiscale model. Finally, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of gaps in the support of the functional order parameters.

Title: Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States
Authors: Qiaofeng Liu, Ian Low, Zhewei Yin
Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer Rényi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\ln (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\ln (5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identify 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.

Title: Towards Efficient Quantum Thermal State Preparation via Local Driving: Lindbladian Simulation with Provable Guarantees
Authors: Dominik Hahn, S. A. Parameswaran, Benedikt Placke
Abstract: Preparing the thermal density matrix $\rho_{\beta} \propto e^{-\beta H}$ corresponding to a given Hamiltonian $H$ is a task of central interest across quantum many-body physics, and is particularly salient when attempting to study it with quantum computers. Although solved in principle by recent constructions of efficiently simulable Lindblad master equations -- that provably have $\rho_{\beta}$ as a steady state [C.-F.~Chen \emph{et al.}, Nature \textbf{646}, pp.~561--566 (2025)] -- the implementation of these ``exact Gibbs samplers'' requires large-scale quantum computational resources and is hence challenging \emph{in practice} on current or even near-term quantum devices. Here, we propose a scheme for approximately simulating an exact Gibbs sampler that only requires the repeated implementation of three readily available ingredients: (a) analog simulation of $H$; (b) strictly local but time-dependent couplings to ancilla qubits; and (c) reset of the ancillas. We give rigorous guarantees on the difference between the fixed point reached by our protocol and the exact thermal state, which only depend on parameters of the protocol and its \emph{mixing time}. The procedure is efficiently implementable on near-term devices if $H$ is local, and the mixing time scales mildly with both system size and protocol parameters. While guaranteeing the latter for Hamiltonians of interest remains an important problem for future work, here we lay the groundwork for developing fully efficient thermal state preparation protocols on quantum simulators.

Title: Hybrid thermalization in the large $N$ limit
Authors: Toshali Mitra, Sukrut Mondkar, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Alexander Soloviev
Abstract: Semi-holography provides a formulation of dynamics in gauge theories involving both weakly self-interacting (perturbative) and strongly self-interacting (non-perturbative) degrees of freedom. These two subsectors interact via their effective metrics and sources, while the full local energy-momentum tensor is conserved in the physical background metric. In the large $N$ limit, the subsectors have their individual entropy currents, and so the full system can reach a pseudo-equilibrium state in which each subsector has a different physical temperature. We first complete the proof that the global thermal equilibrium state, where both subsectors have the \textit{same} physical temperature, can be defined in consistency with the principles of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Particularly, we show that the global equilibrium state is the unique state with maximum entropy in the microcanonical ensemble. Furthermore, we show that in the large $N$ limit, a \textit{typical} non-equilibrium state of the full isolated system relaxes to the global equilibrium state when the average energy density is large compared to the scale set by the inter-system coupling. We discuss quantum statistical perspectives.

Title: Splitting of the three-body Förster resonance in Rb Rydberg atoms as a measure of dipole-dipole interaction strength
Authors: I.I.Ryabtsev, I.N.Ashkarin, I.I.Beterov, D.B.Tretyakov, E.A.Yakshina, V.M.Entin, P.Cheinet
Abstract: Three-body Förster resonances controlled by a dc electric field are of interest for the implementation of three-qubit quantum gates with single atoms in optical traps using their laser excitation into strongly interacting Rydberg states. In our recent theoretical paper [Zh. Eksper. Teor. Fiz. 168(1), 14 (2025)] it was found that the proposed earlier three-body Förster resonance $3\times nP_{3/2} \to nS_{1/2} +(n+1)S_{1/2} +nP_{1/2} $ in Rb Rydberg atoms has a splitting, with one of the split components having weaker dependence of the resonant electric field (and the corresponding dynamic shift) on the distance $R$ between the atoms. Here we study this effect in more detail, since such a resonance is the most suitable for performing experiments on observing coherent oscillations of populations of collective three-body states and implementing three-qubit quantum gates based on them. For a linear spatial configuration of three interacting Rydberg atoms, the physical mechanism of this phenomenon is revealed and analytical formulas are obtained that describe the behavior of split structure of the Förster resonance depending on $R$. It is found that the splitting is a measure of the energy of the resonant dipole-dipole exchange interaction with an excitation hopping between neighboring Rydberg states $S$ and $P$.

Title: Stochastic synaptic dynamics under learning
Authors: Jakob Stubenrauch, Naomi Auer, Richard Kempter, Benjamin Lindner
Abstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which affects and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored.

Title: Low-Power Control of Resistance Switching Transitions in First-Order Memristors
Authors: Valeriy A. Slipko, Alon Ascoli, Fernando Corinto, Yuriy V. Pershin
Abstract: In many cases, the behavior of physical memristive devices can be relatively well captured by using a single internal state variable. This study investigates the low-power control of first-order memristive devices to derive the most energy-efficient protocols for programming their resistances. A unique yet general approach to optimizing the switching transitions in devices of this kind is introduced. For pedagogical purposes, without loss of generality, the proposed control paradigm is applied to a couple of differential algebraic equation sets for voltage-controlled devices, specifically Kvatinsky's Voltage ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor mathematical description and Miranda's and Sune's dynamic balance model. It is demonstrated that, depending upon intrinsic physical properties of the device, captured in the model formulas and parameter setting, and upon constraints on programming time and voltages, the optimal protocol for either of the two switching scenarios may require the application of a single square voltage pulse of height set to a certain level within the admissible range across a fraction or entire given programming time interval, or of some more involved voltage stimulus of unique polarity, including analogue continuous waveforms that can be approximated by trains of square voltage pulses of different heights, over the entire programming time interval. The practical implications of these research findings are significant, as the development of energy-efficient protocols to program memristive devices, resolving the so-called voltage-time dilemma in the device physics community, is a subject under intensive and extensive studies across the academic community and industry.

Title: A microfluidic band-pass filter for flexible fiber separation
Authors: Li Zhibo, Bielinski Clément, Lindner Anke, Delmotte Blaise, du Roure Olivia
Abstract: The control of particle trajectories in structured microfluidic environments has significantly advanced sorting technologies, most notably through deterministic lateral displacement (DLD). While previous work has largely targeted rigid, near-spherical particles, the sorting of flexible, anisotropic objects such as fibers remains largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to demonstrate how tilted pillar arrays enable efficient, length-based separation of flexible fibers. We discover that these arrays act as band-pass filters, selectively inducing lateral migration in fibers whose lengths are close to the array period. Fibers significantly shorter or longer exhibit minimal lateral deviation. This migration arises from the interplay of fluid-structure interactions between fibers and the complex flow and steric interactions with the pillars. Depending on their length, fibers exhibit distinct transport regimes: short fibers zigzag in between pillars following the flow, intermediate length fibers exhibit wrapping and jumping from one pillar to another, leading to lateral displacement, and long fibers deform extensively, following mixed zigzag-jump trajectories with minimal lateral migration. We identify the mechanical tension that develops in the fiber when wrapped around the pillars as the driving mechanism of cross-streamline transport. Leveraging this band-pass effect, we designed a highly efficient separation device to collect monodisperse fiber suspensions. Our findings not only expand the functional scope of DLD-like systems but also open new avenues for understanding transport of anisotropic objects in porous media.

Title: Quantum open system description of a hybrid plasmonic cavity
Authors: Marco Vallone
Abstract: We present a unified quantum open system framework for lossy plasmonic cavities in which coherent dynamics, relaxation, dephasing, and irreversible absorption are treated on equal footing. The Dyson equation for the cavity photon propagator in the random-phase approximation yields a complex self-energy S that accounts for both the renormalization and the damping of hybrid plasmon-photon modes (polaritons, in a quasi-particle description). Tracing out the electronic and photonic environments leads to a Liouvillian for the upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritonic branches, incorporating leakage through the imaginary part of the self-energy, internal UP-LP scattering rates, and dephasing. Time evolution equations for polariton populations, interbranch coherence, and driven amplitudes in closed form also provide analytic expressions for their steady-state values, the quench rate of UP-LP oscillations and polaritonic lineshapes, valid in the limit of low polaritonic density, but covering light-matter ultrastrong coupling. The theory establishes a self-consistent description of dissipative polariton dynamics in plasmonic and nanophotonic cavities, directly applicable to response spectra, time-domain measurements, and dissipation engineering.

Title: Functional Percolation: Criticality of Form and Function
Authors: Galen J. Wilkerson
Abstract: Understanding how network structure constrains and enables information processing is a central problem in the statistical mechanics of interacting systems. Here we study random networks across the structural percolation transition and analyze how connectivity governs realizable input-output transformations under cascade dynamics. Using Erdos-Renyi networks as a minimal ensemble, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree. We find that the emergence of the giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow, quantified by transfer entropy, extends beyond local neighborhoods. We term this coincidence of structural, functional, and informational transitions functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the percolation threshold. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality may provide a general organizing principle of information processing capacity in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.

Title: Basis dependence of Neural Quantum States for the Transverse Field Ising Model
Authors: Ronald Santiago Cortes, Aravindh S. Shankar, Marcello Dalmonte, Roberto Verdel, Nils Niggemann
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are powerful tools used to represent complex quantum many-body states in an increasingly wide range of applications. However, despite their popularity, at present only a rudimentary understanding of their limitations exists. In this work, we investigate the dependence of NQS on the choice of the computational basis, focusing on restricted Boltzmann machines. Considering a family of rotated Hamiltonians corresponding to the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model, we discuss the properties of ground states responsible for the dependence of NQS performance, namely the presence of ground state degeneracies as well as the uniformity of amplitudes and phases, carefully examining their interplay. We identify that the basis-dependence of the performance is linked to the convergence properties of a cluster or cumulant expansion of multi-spin operators -- providing a framework to directly connect physical, basis-dependent properties, to performance itself. Our results provide insights that may be used to gauge the applicability of NQS to new problems and to identify the optimal basis for numerical computations.

Title: Not all Chess960 positions are equally complex
Authors: Marc Barthelemy
Abstract: We analyze strategic complexity across all 960 Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) starting positions. Stockfish evaluations show a near-universal first-move advantage for White ($\langle E \rangle = +0.30 \pm 0.14$ pawns), indicating that the advantage conferred by moving first is a robust structural feature of the game. To quantify decision difficulty, we introduce an information-based measure $S(n)$ describing the cumulative information required to identify optimal moves over the first $n$ plies. This measure decomposes into contributions from White and Black, $S_W$ and $S_B$, yielding a total opening complexity $S_{\mathrm{tot}} = S_W + S_B$ and a decision asymmetry $A=S_B-S_W$. Across the ensemble, $S_{\mathrm{tot}}$ varies by a factor of three, while $A$ spans from $-2.5$ to $+1.8$ bits, showing that some openings burden White and others Black. The mean $\langle A \rangle = -0.25$ bits indicates a slight tendency for White to face harder opening decisions. Standard chess (position \#518, \texttt{RNBQKBNR}) exhibits above-average asymmetry (91st percentile) but typical overall complexity (47th percentile). The most complex opening is \#226 (\texttt{BNRQKBNR}), whereas \#198 (\texttt{QNBRKBNR})is the most balanced, with both evaluation and asymmetry near zero. These results reveal a highly heterogeneous Chess960 landscape in which small rearrangements of the back-rank pieces can significantly alter strategic depth and competitive fairness. Remarkably, the classical starting position-despite centuries of cultural selection-lies far from the most balanced configuration.

Title: Classifying fusion rules of anyons or SymTFTs: A general algebraic formula for domain wall problems and quantum phase transitions
Authors: Yoshiki Fukusumi
Abstract: We propose a formula for the transformation law of anyons in topologically ordered phases or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) through a gapped or symmetry-preserving domain wall. Our formalism is based on the ring homomorphism between the $\mathbb{C}$-linear commutative fusion rings, also known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). The fundamental assumption in our formalism is the validity of the Verlinde formula, applicable to commutative fusion rings. By combining it with more specific data of the settings, our formula provides classifications of anyons compatible with developing categorical formulations. It also provides the massless renormalization group (RG) flows between conformal field theories (CFTs), or a series of measurement-induced quantum phase transitions, in the language of SymTFT, through the established correspondence between CFTs and TQFTs. Moreover, by studying the correspondence between the ideal structure in the massless RG and the module in the related massive RG, one can make the Nambu-Goldstone-type arguments for generalized symmetry. By combining our formula with orbifolding, extension, and similarity transformation, one can get a series of classifications for the corresponding extended models, or symmetry-enriched topological orders and quantum criticalities.

Title: Modeling phononic band gap in microstructured solids using the Riemann-Cartan geometric framework
Authors: Ilya Peshkov, Loïc Le Marrec
Abstract: This paper discusses the modeling of acoustic wave fields in microstructured elastic solids within the framework of Riemann-Cartan geometry. We consider a scenario in which microstructural deformations occur significantly faster than those of the bulk material. This time-scale separation creates apparent geometric incompatibilities at the macroscopic level, even in the absence of permanent inelastic deformation or damage. We formalize this phenomenon by using a non-holonomic frame field to represent macroscopic elastic deformations and an associated torsion field to characterize the resulting geometric incompatibilities. The spatial components of the torsion tensor quantify the instantaneous geometric incompatibility of the macroscopic deformations, while its temporal components capture the inertial effects arising from the reversible energy exchange between the micro- and macro-scales. A key finding is that the model's dispersion relation predicts a complete frequency band gap. Furthermore, the governing equations exhibit a mathematical analogy to Maxwell's equations, potentially bridging the modeling of phononic and photonic metamaterials.

Title: Obstructions to Unitary Hamiltonians in Non-Unitary String-Net Models
Authors: Hanshi Yang
Abstract: The Levin-Wen string-net formalism provides a canonical mapping from spherical fusion categories to local Hamiltonians defining Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\text{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations.

Title: Finite-Memory Extension of Tegmark's Decoherence Bound in Biological Media
Authors: Ramandeep Dewan
Abstract: Tegmark's decoherence bound is derived under the assumption of a strictly memoryless environment. We show that this result corresponds to the singular limit of a finite-memory theory. For exponentially correlated environments decoherence is generically quadratic at short times and the decoherence time scales as the square root of the bath correlation time. For the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bath we derive the exact non-Markovian coherence equation and verify the predicted scaling using an exact pseudomode mapping. Tegmark's bound is recovered only in the vanishing-memory limit.

Title: Computing quantum magic of state vectors
Authors: Piotr Sierant, Jofre Vallès-Muns, Artur Garcia-Saez
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, also known as ``magic,'' quantifies how far a quantum state departs from the stabilizer set. It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of quantum many-body states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods compute SRE and mana at cost $O(N d^{2N})$, providing an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, with substantial parallelism and straightforward GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package HadaMAG ( this https URL ), which provides a high-performance toolbox for computing SRE and mana with built-in support for multithreading, MPI-based distributed parallelism, and GPU acceleration. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems.
