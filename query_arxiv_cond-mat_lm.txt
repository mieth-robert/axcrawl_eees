Title: Nonlinear Dielectric Decrement of Electrolyte Solutions: an Effective Medium Approach
Authors: Yasuya Nakayama
Abstract: Hypothesis. The dielectric constant of an electrolyte solution, which determines electrostatic interactions between colloids and interfaces, depends nonlinearly on the salinity and also on the type of salt. The linear decrement at dilute solutions is due to the reduced polarizability in the hydration shell around an ion. However, the full hydration volume cannot explain the experimental solubility, which indicates the hydration volume should decrease at high salinity. Volume reduction of the hydration shell is supposed to weaken dielectric decrement and thus should be relevant to the nonlinear decrement. Simulations. According to the effective medium theory for the permittivity of heterogeneous media, we derive an equation which relates the dielectric constant with the dielectric cavities created by the hydrated cations and anions, and the effect of partial dehydration at high salinity is taken into account. Findings. Analysis of experiments on monovalent electrolytes suggests that weakened dielectric decrement at high salinity originates primarily from the partial dehydration. Furthermore, the onset volume fraction of the partial dehydration is found to be salt-specific, and is correlated with the solvation free energy. Our results suggest that while the reduced polarizability of the hydration shell determines the linear dielectric decrement at low salinity, ion-specific tendency of dehydration is responsible for nonlinear dielectric decrement at high salinity.

Title: Re-experiment Smart: a Novel Method to Enhance Data-driven Prediction of Mechanical Properties of Epoxy Polymers
Authors: Wanshan Cui, Yejin Jeong, Inwook Song, Gyuri Kim, Minsang Kwon, Donghun Lee
Abstract: Accurate prediction of polymer material properties through data-driven approaches greatly accelerates novel material development by reducing redundant experiments and trial-and-error processes. However, inevitable outliers in empirical measurements can severely skew machine learning results, leading to erroneous prediction models and suboptimal material designs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach to enhance dataset quality efficiently by integrating multi-algorithm outlier detection with selective re-experimentation of unreliable outlier cases. To validate the empirical effectiveness of the approach, we systematically construct a new dataset containing 701 measurements of three key mechanical properties: glass transition temperature ($T_g$), tan $\delta$ peak, and crosslinking density ($v_{c}$). To demonstrate its general applicability, we report the performance improvements across multiple machine learning models, including Elastic Net, SVR, Random Forest, and TPOT, to predict the three key properties. Our method reliably reduces prediction error (RMSE) and significantly improves accuracy with minimal additional experimental work, requiring only about 5% of the dataset to be this http URL findings highlight the importance of data quality enhancement in achieving reliable machine learning applications in polymer science and present a scalable strategy for improving predictive reliability in materials science.

Title: Anyon superconductivity and plateau transitions in doped fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulators
Authors: Pavel A. Nosov, Zhaoyu Han, Eslam Khalaf
Abstract: Recent experiments reported evidence of superconductivity and re-entrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) insulator upon doping the $\nu_e = 2/3$ fractional quantum anomalous Hall states (FQAH) in twisted MoTe${}_2$, separated by narrow resistive regions. Anyons of a FQAH generally have a finite effective mass, and when described by anyon-flux composite fermions (CF), experience statistical magnetic fields with a commensurate filling. Here, we show that most of the experimental observations can be explained by invoking the effects of disorder on the Landau-Hofstadter bands of CFs. In particular, by making minimal assumptions about the anyon energetics and dispersion, we show that doping anyons drives plateau transitions of CFs into integer quantum Hall states, which physically corresponds to either to a superconductor or to a RIQAH phase. We develop a dictionary that allows us to infer the response in these phases and the critical regions from the knowledge of the response functions of the plateau transitions. In particular, this allows us to relate the superfluid stiffness of the superconductor to the polarizability of CFs. As a first step towards a quantitative understanding, we borrow results from the celebrated integer quantum Hall plateau transitions to make quantitative prediction for the critical behavior of the superfluid stiffness, longitudinal and Hall conductivity, and response to out-of-plane magnetic field, all of which agree reasonably well with the experimental observations. Our results provide strong support for anyon superconductivity being the mechanism for the observed superconductor in the vicinity of the $\nu_e = 2/3$ FQAH insulator.

Title: Classical spin liquids from frustrated Ising models in hyperbolic space
Authors: Fabian Köhler, Johanna Erdmenger, Roderich Moessner, Matthias Vojta
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Ising models on frustrated lattices can realize classical spin liquids, with highly degenerate ground states and, possibly, fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. Motivated by the recent interest in many-body system in negatively curved space, we study hyperbolic frustrated Ising models. Specifically, we consider nearest-neighbor Ising models on tesselations with odd-length loops in two-dimensional hyperbolic space. For finite systems with open boundaries we determine the ground-state degeneracy exactly, and we perform extensive finite-temperature Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain thermodynamic data as well as correlation functions. We show that the shape of the boundary, constituting an extensive part of the system, can be used to control low-energy states: Depending on the boundary, we find ordered or disordered ground states. Our results demonstrate how geometric frustration acts in curved space to produce classical spin liquids.

Title: Anyon delocalization transitions out of a disordered FQAH insulator
Authors: Zhengyan Darius Shi, T. Senthil
Abstract: Motivated by the experimental discovery of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, we develop a theory of doping-induced transitions out of the $\nu = 2/3$ lattice Jain state in the presence of quenched disorder. We show that disorder strongly affects the evolution into the conducting phases described in our previous work. The delocalization of charge $2/3$ anyons leads to a chiral topological superconductor through a direct second order transition for a smooth random potential with long wavelength modulations. The longitudinal resistance has a universal peak at the associated quantum critical point. For short wavelength disorder, this transition generically splits into three distinct ones with intermediate insulating topological phases. If instead, the charge $1/3$ anyon delocalizes, then at low doping the result is a Reentrant Integer Quantum Hall state with $\rho_{xy} = h/e^2$. At higher doping this undergoes a second transition to a Fermi liquid metal. We show that this framework provides a plausible explanation for the complex phase diagram recently observed in twisted MoTe$_2$ near $\nu = 2/3$ and discuss future experiments that can test our theory in more detail.

Title: Line shapes in time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy explored by machine learning
Authors: Tami C. Meyer, Gesa-R. Siemann, Paulina Majchrzak, Thomas Seyller, Jennifer Rigden, Yu Zhang, Emma Springate, Charlotte Sanders, Philip Hofmann
Abstract: Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is a powerful technique for investigating the dynamics of excited carriers in quantum materials. Typically, data analysis proceeds via the inspection of time distribution curves (TDCs), which represent the time-dependent photoemission intensity in a region of interest -- often chosen somewhat arbitrarily -- in energy-momentum space. Here, we employ $k$-means, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to systematically investigate trends in TDC line shape for quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene and for a simple analytical model. Our analysis reveals how finite energy and time resolution can affect the TDC line shape. We discuss how this can be taken into account in a quantitative analysis, and under what conditions the time-dependent photoemission intensity after laser excitation can be approximated by a simple exponential decay.

Title: Microscopic mechanisms of Strong Electron Scattering and Giant Anomalous Hall Effect in high-Curie-temperature Fe3GaTe2 van der Waals Films
Authors: Zhengxiao Li, Xin Lin, Yu Zou, Fanjie Tan, Wenliang Zhu, Lijun Zhu
Abstract: Van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 with room-temperature perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and strong anomalous Hall effect has attracted considerable interest for their potential in spintronics. However, the microscopic mechanisms and manipulation of the electron scattering and the anomalous Hall effect of Fe3GaTe2 have remained unsettled. Here, we demonstrate strong tuning of the electron scattering and anomalous Hall effect of pattern-defined Fe3GaTe2 Hall-bar devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, high Curie temperature (340 K, as high as that of Fe3GaTe2 bulk), and giant anomalous Hall effect by varying the layer thickness and temperature. Temperature-dependent resistivity experiments reveal that the electron scattering of the high-quality Fe3GaTe2 is dominated by impurity scattering and phonon scattering, regardless of the thickness. Combined temperature- and thickness-dependent scaling analyses of the anomalous Hall resistivity reveal that the anomalous Hall effect of the Fe3GaTe2 is predominantly from the positive, temperature-independent skew-scattering contribution that competes with negative temperature-independent, side-jump contribution, and negative, temperature-dependent intrinsic Berry-curvature contribution. The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity decreases rapidly with increasing impurity scattering, which is consistent with the characteristic variation of intrinsic Hall conductivities in the dirty-metal regime. These findings advance the understanding of electron scattering and the anomalous Hall effect in van der Waals magnets and would benefit the application of the Fe3GaTe2 in spintronics.

Title: Tunable magnons in a dual-gated 2D antiferromagnet

Abstract: The layered antiferromagnet CrSBr features magnons coupled to other quasiparticles, including excitons and polaritons, enabling their easy optical accessibility. In this work, we investigate the tunability of magnons in few-layered devices in response to changes in carrier density and the application of a perpendicular electric field. We demonstrate an on-chip tunability of the in- and out-of-phase magnon frequencies by up to 2 GHz. While the frequencies of both modes increase with the electron density, we observe an asymmetric response with respect to the electric field in a dual-gated trilayer device. To understand the mechanism of this disparity, we develop a layer-resolved macrospin model describing the magnetic dynamics in thin, non-uniformly doped devices. Through this model we establish the doping- and electric-field-dependence of the exchange interaction, magnetic anisotropy, and magnetic moment of individual layers. Our results advance the applications of gate-tunable magnonic devices based on 2D materials.

Title: Impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice on topological magnons and edge states in ferromagnetic 2D skyrmion crystals
Authors: Doried Ghader, Bilal Jabakhanji
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the magnon band topology and associated topological edge states (TESs) in Neel-type ferromagnetic skyrmion crystals (SkXs) stabilized on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, using parameters relevant to monolayer CrI3. Employing stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations and discrete Holstein-Primakoff bosonization, we analyze the impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice structure on the magnonic spectrum, in contrast to the extensively studied triangular spin-lattice SkXs. Our analysis identifies topological features unique to the honeycomb lattice. In particular, certain characteristic magnon modes (e.g., elliptical distortion and triangular distortion modes) acquire nontrivial Chern numbers absent in triangular-based SkXs. Moreover, contrary to predictions based on triangular spin-lattice SkXs, we find that the counterclockwise (CCW)-breathing magnonic gap exhibits topological behavior only at large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI), losing its universality with decreasing DMI strength. Meanwhile, the second magnon gap consistently hosts robust TESs across the entire range of DMI and magnetic fields studied, closing at critical fields through field-induced topological phase transitions. The study further uncovers a remarkable richness in the magnon topology, identifying 65 distinct topological magnon phases generated by magnetic-field-driven skyrmion deformation. These findings underscore the profound role of lattice geometry in shaping magnon topology in non-collinear spin textures.

Title: Static vs dynamic rough energy landscapes: Where is diffusion faster?
Authors: Dmitrii E. Makarov, Peter Sollich
Abstract: Molecules in dense environments, such as biological cells, are subjected to forces that fluctuate both in time and in space. While spatial fluctuations are captured by Lifson-Jackson-Zwanzig's model of "diffusion in a rough potential", and temporal fluctuations are often viewed as leading to additional friction effects, a unified view where the environment fluctuates both in time and in space is currently lacking. Here we introduce a discrete-state model of a landscape fluctuating both in time and in space. Importantly, the model accounts for the back-reaction of the diffusing particle on the landscape. As a result we find, surprisingly, that many features of the observable dynamics do not depend on the temporal fluctuation timescales and are already captured by the model of diffusion in a rough potential, even though this assumes a static energy landscape.

Title: Nonequilibrium transport through the Hubbard dimer
Authors: Yaroslav Pavlyukh, Riku Tuovinen
Abstract: We apply a computationally efficient approach to study the time- and energy-resolved spectral properties of a two-site Hubbard model using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. By employing the iterative generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz ($i$GKBA) within a time-linear framework, we avoid the computational cost of solving the full two-time Kadanoff-Baym equations. Spectral information is extracted by coupling the system to multiple narrow-band leads, establishing a direct analogy to photoemission experiments. Our results reveal correlation-induced shifts and broadenings of spectral features, along with a suppression of transient current oscillations. This approach provides a promising avenue for analyzing correlated electron dynamics in open quantum systems.

Title: Discovery of the Type-II Superconductor Ta$_4$Rh$_2$C$_{1-δ}$ with a High Upper Critical Field
Authors: KeYuan Ma, Sara López-Paz, Karolina Gornicka, Harald O. Jeschke, Tomasz Klimczuk, Fabian O. von Rohr
Abstract: We report on the discovery of superconductivity in the previously unknown compound Ta$_4$Rh$_2$C$_{1-\delta}$. Ta$_4$Rh$_2$C$_{1-\delta}$ crystallizes in the $\eta$-carbide structure type, in the cubic space group $Fd\bar{3}m$ (No.227) with a unit cell parameter of $a = $ 11.7947 Å. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, and specific heat capacity measurements reveal that Ta$_4$Rh$_2$C$_{1-\delta}$ is a type-II bulk superconductor with a critical temperature of $T_{\rm c}$ = 6.4 K, and a normalized specific heat jump $\Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c}$ = 1.56. Notably, we find Ta$_4$Rh$_2$C$_{1-\delta}$ has a high upper critical field of $\mu_0 H_{\rm c2}{\rm (0)}$ = 17.4 T, which is exceeding the BCS weak coupling Pauli limit of $\mu_0 H_{\rm Pauli}$ = 11.9 T.

Title: First-Principles and Machine Learning Investigation of the Structural and Optoelectronic Properties of Dodecaphenylyne: A Novel Carbon Allotrope
Authors: Kleuton A. L. Lima, Jose A. S. Laranjeira, Nicolas F. Martins, Julio R. Sambrano, Alexandre C. Dias, Luiz A. Ribeiro Junior, Douglas S. Galvao
Abstract: We report the computational discovery and characterization of Dodecaphenylyne (DP), a novel carbon allotrope with a distinctive geometric arrangement. DP structural, thermodynamic, mechanical, electronic, and optical properties were evaluated using density functional theory and a machine learning interatomic potential trained explicitly for this material. The formation energy of -7.98 eV/atom indicates high thermodynamic stability, further supported by the absence of imaginary phonon modes and the preservation of structural integrity up to 1000 K in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Mechanical analysis reveals high in-plane stiffness with directional dependence: Young's modulus values of 469.09 GPa and 600.41 GPa along the x and y directions, respectively. Electronic band structure and projected density of states analyses confirm the DP semiconducting character. Calculations of carrier mobility using the deformation potential theory reveal pronounced anisotropy, with maximum values reaching up to $30.6 \times 10^4$ cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s (electrons, e) and $8.4 \times 10^4$ cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s (holes, h), much higher than the observed for other 2D materials. DP also exhibits anisotropic optical absorption in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum, highlighting its potential for optoelectronic applications.

Title: Atomic-scale mapping of interfacial phonon modes in epitaxial YBa2Cu3O7-δ / (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3 thin films: The role of surface phonons
Authors: Joaquin E. Reyes Gonzalez, Charles Zhang, Rainni K. Chen, John Y.T. Wei, Maureen J. Lagos
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of phonons at the epitaxial interface between YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} thin film and (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3 substrate using vibrational electron energy loss spectroscopy. Interfacial phonon modes with different degrees of scattering localization were identified. We find evidence that surface contributions from the surrounding environment can impose additional scattering modulation into local EELS measurements at the interface. A method to remove those contributions is then used to isolate the phonon information at the interface. This work unveils interfacial phonon modes in a high-Tc cuprate superconductor, that are not accessible with traditional phonon spectroscopy techniques, and provides a method for probing interfacial phonons in complex oxide heterostructures.

Title: A General Approach to the Shape Transition of Run-and-Tumble Particles: The 1D PDMP Framework for Invariant Measure Regularity
Authors: Leo Hahn
Abstract: Run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) have emerged as a paradigmatic example for studying nonequilibrium phenomena in statistical mechanics. The invariant measure of a wide class of RTPs subjected to a potential possesses a density, which is continuous when tumble rates are high and discontinuous when they are low. This key feature is known as shape transition. By comparison with the Boltzmann distribution characteristic of thermodynamic equilibrium, this constitutes a qualitative indicator of the relative closeness (continuous density) or strong deviation (discontinuous density) from the equilibrium setting. Furthermore, the points where the density diverges represent typical states where the system spends most of its time in the low tumble rate regime. Building on and extending existing results concerning the regularity of the invariant measure of one-dimensional piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), we show how to characterize the shape transition even in situations where the invariant measure cannot be computed explicitly. Our analysis confirms shape transition as a robust, general feature of RTPs subjected to a potential. We improve the qualitative picture of the degree to which general RTPs deviate from equilibrium and identify their typical states in the low tumble rate regime. We also refine the regularity theory for the invariant measure of one-dimensional PDMPs.

Title: Energy minima and ordering in ferromagnets with quenched randomness
Authors: D. A. Garanin
Abstract: Energy minimization at T=0 and Monte Carlo simulations at T>0 have been performed for 2D and 3D random-field and random-anisotropy systems of up to 100 million classical spins. The main finding is that 3D random-anisotropy systems magnetically order on lowering temperature, contrary to the theoretical predictions based on the Imry-Ma argument. If random-anisotropy is stronger than the exchange, which can be the case in sintered materials, the system still orders but the magnetization is strongly reduced and there is a large spin-glass component in the spin state, the heat capacity having a cusp instead of a divergence. 3D random-field systems do not magnetically order on lowering temperature but rather freeze into the correlated spin-glass state. Here, although magnetized local energy minima have lower energies than non-magnetized ones, magnetic ordering is prevented by singularities pinned by the random field.

Title: Ultrahigh-Q Torsional Nanomechanics through Bayesian Optimization
Authors: Atkin D. Hyatt, Aman R. Agrawal, Christian M. Pluchar, Charles A. Condos, Dalziel J. Wilson
Abstract: Recently it was discovered that torsion modes of strained nanoribbons exhibit dissipation dilution, giving a route to enhanced torque sensing and quantum optomechanics experiments. As with all strained nanomechanical resonators, an important limitation is bending loss due to mode curvature at the clamps. Here we use Bayesian optimization to design nanoribbons with optimal dissipation dilution of the fundamental torsion mode. Applied to centimeter-scale Si$_3$N$_4$ nanoribbons, we realize $Q$ factors exceeding 100 million and $Q$-frequency products exceeding $10^{13}$ Hz at room temperature. The thermal torque sensitivity of the reported devices is at the level of $10^{-20}\;\text{N}\,\text{m}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ and the zero point angular displacement spectral density is at the level of $10^{-10}\;\text{rad}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$; they are moreover simple to fabricate, have high thermal conductivity, and can be heavily mass-loaded without diminishing their $Q$, making them attractive for diverse fundamental and applied weak force sensing tasks.

Title: Sodium-Decorated P-C3N: A Porous 2D Framework for High-Capacity and Reversible Hydrogen Storage
Authors: Jose A. S. Laranjeira, Nicolas F. Martins, Kleuton A. L. Lima, Lingtao Xiao, Xihao Chen, Luiz A. Ribeiro Junior, Julio R. Sambrano
Abstract: The development of reversible hydrogen storage materials has become crucial for enabling carbon-neutral energy systems. Based on this, the present work investigates the hydrogen storage on the sodium-decorated P-C$_3$N (Na@P-C$_3$N), a porous carbon nitride monolayer recently proposed as a stable semiconductor. First-principles calculations reveal that Na atoms preferentially adsorb with an adsorption energy of -4.48~eV, effectively suppressing clusterization effects. Upon decoration, the system becomes metallic, while \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations confirm the thermal stability of Na@P-C$_3$N at 300~K. Hydrogen adsorption on Na@P-C$_3$N occurs through weak physisorption, with energies ranging from -0.18 to -0.28~eV, and desorption temperatures between 231 and 357~K. The system can stably absorb 16 H$_2$ molecules per unit cell, corresponding to a gravimetric storage capacity of 9.88~wt\%, surpassing the U.S. Department of Energy target. These results demonstrate that Na@P-C$_3$N is a promising candidate for lightweight, stable, and reversible hydrogen storage.

Title: OLi3-decorated Irida-graphene for High-capacity Hydrogen Storage: A First-principles Study
Authors: Jose A. S. Laranjeira, Warda Elaggoune, Nicolas F. Martins, Xihao Chen, Julio R. Sambrano
Abstract: Efficient hydrogen storage in solid-state materials is essential for next-generation energy systems, yet achieving a high gravimetric capacity with optimal adsorption characteristics remains a critical challenge. Although Li-decorated irida-graphene (IG) has shown promising hydrogen storage potential, its capacity is limited to $\sim$ 7wt\%, which, despite exceeding the U.S. DOE target, remains inadequate for large-scale applications. Additionally, Li clustering over extended cycles may compromise adsorption efficiency and structural stability. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the hydrogen storage potential of IG decorated with superalkali OLi$_3$ clusters, aiming to enhance the adsorption capacity and stability for advanced hydrogen storage technologies. Our findings show that the OLi$_3$ clusters exhibit a significant binding energy of -3.24 eV, which highlights its strong interaction with the IG. OLi$_3$@IG complex can host up to 12H$_2$ molecules, with optimal maximum storage capacity of 10.00 wt\%. Additionally, the release temperature (T$_R$) and \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations indicate that H$_2$ molecules can be efficiently released at operating temperatures under ambient conditions. These results highlight the potential of OLi$_3$-decorated irida-graphene as a promising candidate for reversible hydrogen storage.

Title: Cell-Scale Dynamic Modeling of Membrane Interactions with Arbitrarily Shaped Particles
Authors: Didarul Ahasan Redwan, Justin Reicher, Xin Yong
Abstract: Modeling membrane interactions with arbitrarily shaped colloidal particles, such as environmental micro- and nanoplastics, at the cell scale remains particularly challenging, owing to the complexity of particle geometries and the need to resolve fully coupled translational and rotational dynamics. Here, we present a force-based computational framework capable of capturing dynamic interactions between deformable lipid vesicles and rigid particles of irregular shapes. Both vesicle and particle surfaces are represented using triangulated meshes, and Langevin dynamics resolves membrane deformation alongside rigid-body particle motion. Adhesive interactions between the particle and membrane surfaces are modeled using two numerical schemes: a vertex-to-vertex mapping and a vertex-to-surface projection. The latter yields more accurate wrapping energetics, as demonstrated by benchmark comparisons against ideal spheres. The dynamic simulations reveal that lower particle-to-vesicle mass ratios facilitate frequent particle reorientation and complete membrane wrapping, while higher mass ratios limit orientation changes and stabilize partial wrapping. To illustrate the framework's versatility, we simulate interactions involving cubical, rod-like, bowl-shaped, and tetrahedral particles with spherical, cigar-shaped, or biconcave vesicles. This generalizable modeling approach enables predictive, cell-scale studies of membrane-particle interactions across a wide range of geometries, with applications in environmental biophysics and nanomedicine.

Title: Multi-mode cooling of a Bose-Einstein condensate with linear quantum feedback
Authors: Zain Mehdi, Matthew L. Goh, Matthew J. Blacker, Joseph J. Hope, Stuart S. Szigeti
Abstract: We theoretically investigate measurement-based feedback control over the motional degrees of freedom of an oblate quasi-2D atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) subject to continuous density monitoring. We develop a linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) model that describes the multi-mode dynamics of the condensate's collective excitations under continuous measurement and control. Crucially, the multi-mode cold-damping feedback control we consider uses a realistic state-estimation scheme that does not rely upon a particular model of the atomic dynamics. We present analytical results showing that collective excitations can be cooled to below single-phonon average occupation (ground-state cooling) across a broad parameter regime and identify the conditions under which the lowest steady-state phonon occupation is asymptotically achieved. Further, we develop multi-objective optimization methods that explore the trade-off between cooling speed and the final energy of the cloud and provide numerical simulations demonstrating the ground-state cooling of the lowest ten motional modes above the condensate ground state. Our investigation provides concrete guidance on the feedback control design and parameters needed to experimentally realize a feedback-cooled BEC.

Title: Spin-chain multichannel Kondo model via image impurity boundary condition
Authors: Jordan Gaines, Guangjie Li, Jukka Väyrynen
Abstract: One of the signature observables for the electronic multichannel Kondo model is the impurity entropy, which was claimed to be found in $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chain with open boundary condition (OBC) and periodic boundary condition (PBC), respectively for the one-channel and two-channel case. However, it is not clear how to generalize OBC and PBC in Heisenberg chains to find the multichannel Kondo impurity entropy with more than two channels. In this paper, we demonstrate that the correct boundary condition for realizing multichannel Kondo physics in Heisenberg chains is the image impurity boundary condition (IIBC), which yields the expected impurity entropy, $\ln[(\sqrt{5}+1)/2]$ for the three-channel case and $\ln\sqrt{3}$ for the four-channel case. Moreover, the IIBC reduces to OBC for the one-channel case and to PBC for the two-channel case. With IIBC, the finite-size scaling of the impurity entropy and the total spin both match the finite-temperature correction in the electronic multichannel Kondo model. Additionally, we show that the XXZ anisotropy reduces the impurity entropy through a power law of the effective Luttinger liquid parameter.

Title: Highly reliable, ultra-wideband, isolator-free quantum-dot mode-locked frequency combs for optical interconnects beyond 3.2Tb/s
Authors: Shujie Pan, Victoria Cao, Yiheng Feng, Dingyi Wu, Jie Yan, Junjie Yang, Chao Zhao, Xi Xiao, Siming Chen
Abstract: Quantum dot mode-locked laser-based optical frequency combs are emerging as a critical solution for achieving low-cost, high-efficiency, and large-capacity optical interconnects. The practical implementation of wavelength division multiplexing interconnects necessitates a temperature-stable OFC source with a minimum 100 GHz channel spacing to enable high-bandwidth modulation while mitigating the complexity of optical filtering and detection. By leveraging the advanced co-doping technique and a colliding pulse mode-locking scheme, here, we report a compact, ultra-wideband, highly reliable, isolator-free 100 GHz-spacing InAs/GaAs QD OFC source operating up to a record temperature of 140 °C. The comb source delivers a record 3 dB optical bandwidth of 14.312 nm, containing flat-top comb lines, each supporting 128 Gb/s PAM-4 modulation, which results in a total throughput of 3.328 Tb/s with an extremely low power consumption of 0.394 pJ/bit at 25°C. Performance remains stable at 85 °C, with negligible degradation of device critical metrics. Remarkably, accelerated aging tests under harsh conditions (85 °C with 8x threshold current injection) revealed a mean time to failure of approximately 207 years. The QD OFC source demonstrated in this work, for the first time, establishes a concrete link between fundamental research on comb sources and their practical deployment in next-generation, high-density optical interconnect systems.

Title: Revisiting the Mechanisms of Thermal Transport in Vacancy-Defective Silicon
Authors: Xueyan Zhu, Jin Yang, J. Shiomi, Cheng Shao
Abstract: Understanding heat conduction in defective silicon is crucial for electronics and thermoelectrics. Conventional understanding relies on phonon gas picture, treating defects as scattering centers that reduce phonon lifetimes without altering frequencies and group velocities. We go beyond phonon gas picture by employing Wigner transport equation to investigate heat conduction in vacancy-defected silicon. Our findings reveal that while thermal conduction in pristine silicon stems mainly from particle-like propagation of vibrational modes, wave-like tunnelling becomes increasingly significant in the presence of vacancies. Contrary to the conventional belief that defects only perturb mode lifetimes, we demonstrate that vacancies also diminish velocity operators, a dominant factor in thermal conductivity reduction, surpassing even the effect of lifetime shortening. Furthermore, incorporating anharmonic frequencies and interatomic force constants shows that while anharmonicity suppresses thermal conductivity in pristine silicon, this effect weakens with vacancy concentration and reverses to enhance conductivity. These findings challenge conventional knowledge and provide new insights into thermal conduction in defective materials.

Title: Reconstructing the wavefunction of magnetic topological insulators MnBi2Te4 and MnBi4Te7 using spin-resolved photoemission
Authors: Xue Han, Jason Qu, Hengxin Tan, Zicheng Tao, Noah M. Meyer, Patrick S. Kirchmann, Yanfeng Guo, Binghai Yan, Zhi-Xun Shen, Jonathan A. Sobota
Abstract: Despite their importance for exotic quantum effects, the surface electronic structure of magnetic topological insulators MnBi2Te4 and MnBi4Te7 remains poorly understood. Using high-efficiency spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we directly image the spin-polarization and orbital character of the surface states in both compounds and map our observations onto a model wavefunction to describe the complex spin-orbital texture, which solidifies our understanding of the surface band structure by establishing the single-band nature of the most prominent states. Most importantly, our analysis reveals a new mechanism for reducing the magnetic gap of the topological surface states based on the orbital composition of the wavefunction.

Title: Anisotropic superconducting gap probed by $^{125}$Te NMR in noncentrosymmetric Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = Fe, Co)
Authors: Kanako Doi, Hayase Takei, Yusaku Shinoda, Yoshihiko Okamoto, Daigorou Hirai, Koshi Takenaka, Taku Matsushita, Yoshiaki Kobayashi, Yasuhiro Shimizu
Abstract: The superconducting gap symmetry is investigated by $^{125}$Te NMR measurements on Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = Fe, Co) without spatial inversion symmetry. The spin susceptibility obtained from the Knight shift $K$ is suppressed below the superconducting transition temperature, while leaving a finite value down to the lowest temperature ($\simeq 0.4$ K). The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ follows a power law against temperature $T$ without showing a coherence peak characteristic of the isotropic gap. The result implies a pairing admixture or a residual density of states under magnetic field. The normal metallic state has a Korringa scaling relation between $1/T_1T$ and the Knight shift, reflecting a weak electron correlation.

Title: Identification of gapless phases by squaring a twist operator
Authors: Hang Su, Yuan Yao, Akira Furusaki
Abstract: We propose a general necessary condition for a spin chain with SO(3) spin-rotation symmetry to be gapped. Specifically, we prove that the ground state(s) of an SO(3)-symmetric gapped spin chain must be spin singlet(s), and the expectation value of the square of a twist operator asymptotically approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit, where finite-size corrections are inversely proportional to the square root of the system size. This theorem provides (i) supporting evidence for various conjectured gapped phases, and (ii) a sufficient criterion for identifying gapless spin chains. We verify our theorem by numerical simulations for a variety of spin models and show that it offers a novel efficient way to identify gapless phases in spin chains with spin-rotation symmetry.

Title: Electronic structures and magnetism in van der Waals flat-band material Ni$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$
Authors: Yuanji Xu, Xintao Jin, Haoyuan Tang, Fuyang Tian
Abstract: The study of magnetism in two-dimensional materials has garnered significant interest, driven by fundamental investigations into low-dimensional magnetic phenomena and their potential for applications in spintronic devices. Through dynamical mean-field theory calculations, we demonstrate that Ni$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$ exhibits flat-band characteristics resulting from the geometric frustration of its layered triangular lattice. These flat bands are further renormalized due to moderate electronic correlation. Our calculations reveal that the magnetic order of Ni atoms is significantly influenced by both the Coulomb interaction and Hund's coupling, indicating that the physics of Ni atoms is situated in an intermediate region between Hundness and Mottness. Additionally, our results show that Ni atoms experience significant spin fluctuations in their local moments, maintaining paramagnetism at low temperatures. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of vacancies, finding a substantial suppression of the density of states at the Fermi level. The physical mechanisms uncovered by our study provide a comprehensive understanding of the novel properties exhibited by this type of material.

Title: Sequential binding-unbinding based specific interactions highlight exchange dynamics and size distribution of condensates
Authors: Bhanjan Debnath, Parag Katira
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of formation of organelles and biomolecular condensates via liquid-liquid phase separation is a topic of great interest. It is reasonable to assume that the formation of protein-specific condensates inside a crowded, multicomponent cellular environment requires specific protein-protein interactions with lifetimes longer than non-specific protein-protein interactions. These longer-lived, specific interactions can arise through complex protein binding and unbinding pathways. In this work, we investigate single-step and sequential multi-step mechanisms for protein binding-unbinding interactions and model the lifetimes of such interactions in a heuristic manner. We show that while similar average interaction lifetimes can be achieved when binding-unbinding follows a single-step or a sequential multi-step process, the two processes result in two distinct lifetime distributions: exponential and truncated power-law, respectively. We then combine this model with Brownian dynamics simulations to elucidate the impact of these distinct lifetime distributions on condensate dynamics. Our model qualitatively captures important features of condensates, such as their fluidic nature, aging in protein interactions and its impact on the exchange dynamics, and the size distribution of condensates. In a nutshell, our model unravels how specificity in protein binding-unbinding interaction pathways, resulting in unique interaction lifetime distributions, is a key factor shaping the physical properties of biomolecular condensates.

Title: Navigating Phase Transitions with Path-Finding Algorithms: A Strategic Approach to Replica Exchange Monte Carlo
Authors: Akie Kowaguchi, Katsuhiro Endo, Kentaro Nomura, Shuichi Kurabayashi, Paul E. Brumby, Kenji Yasuoka
Abstract: The replica exchange method is a powerful tool for overcoming slow relaxation in molecular simulations, but its efficiency depends strongly on the choice of the number and interval of replicas and their exchange probabilities. Here, we propose a new optimization scheme based on the Dijkstra algorithm that constructs an optimal exchange path by representing replicas and their exchange probabilities as a graph. Inspired by path-finding techniques widely used in computer science, including applications in game algorithms, our approach ensures that transitions follow a minimum entropy gradient path and effectively speeds up sampling even in systems exhibiting slow relaxation near critical points or phase transition regions. The method provides a systematic way to improve replica exchange efficiency and offers new insights into the control of relaxation dynamics, as demonstrated through applications to the solid-liquid phase transition of the Lennard-Jones bulk system.

Title: Universal band center model for the HER activity of non-metal site
Authors: Ruixin Xu, Shiqian Cao, Tingting Bo, Yanyu Liu, Wei Zhou
Abstract: In this work, the hydrogen evolution reaction activities of non-metal sites in the transition metal dichalcogenides with the stoichiometry of MX2 are investigated using the first principles calculations. The trained machine learning model demonstrates that the pz band center, bandgap, and period effect are the key factors influencing the HER activity of MX2. Furthermore, it also reveals that the observed non-scaling law between the pz band center and HER activity in the semiconductor-like materials originates from the bandgap-induced downshift of bonding and antibonding states. In addition to the bandgap, the intrinsic p orbital energy level of the non-metal atoms also contributes to the periodic variation of pz band center. Extended calculations indicate that the descriptor is equally applicable to the other catalysts, suggesting its universality in predicting the HER activity of non-metal sites.

Title: Phonon-Induced Current Noise in Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes across the Ballistic-Diffusive Crossover
Authors: Aina Sumiyoshi, Takahiro Yamamoto
Abstract: We theoretically elucidate the system length ($L$) dependence of phonon-induced current noise in carbon nanotubes at room temperature over a broad range, encompassing the quantum ballistic and classical diffusive regimes. The power spectral density for the current noise is maximally enhanced when $L$ is comparable to the mean free path $L_0$ of an electron. In the ballistic limit of $L/L_0\ll 1$, the power spectral density increases in proportion to $L$, whereas in the diffusive limit of $L/L_0\gg 1$, it shows a power-law decay $L^{-\alpha}$ with a scaling parameter $\alpha=3.81$. The noise decay for single-walled carbon nanotubes is faster than that previously predicted based on a simple model because of the various electron-phonon scattering processes and the complex energy dependence of the phonon relaxation time.

Title: Confinement-induced resonances for the creation of quasi-1D ultra cold gases of alkali--alkaline-earth dimers
Authors: Lorenzo Oghittu, Premjith Thekkeppatt, Nirav P. Mehta, Seth T. Rittenhouse, Klaasjan van Druten, Florian Schreck, Arghavan Safavi-Naini
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the role of confinement-induced resonances (CIRs) in low-dimensional ultracold atomic mixtures for the formation of weakly bound dimers. To this end, we examine the scattering properties of a binary atomic mixture confined by a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) potential. In this regime, the interspecies two-body interaction is modeled as an effective 1D zero-range pseudopotential, with a coupling strength $g_\mathrm{1D}$ derived as a function of the three-dimensional scattering length $a$. This framework enables the study of CIRs in harmonically confined systems, with particular attention to the case of mismatched transverse trapping frequencies for the two atomic species. Finally, we consider the Bose-Fermi mixture of $^{87}$Rb and $^{87}$Sr, and identify values of the experimentally accessible parameters for which CIRs can be exploited to create weakly bound molecules.

Title: Emergent rigidity percolation of five-fold aggregates enables controllable glass properties
Authors: Wei Chu, Zheng Wang, Christopher Ness, Konrad Samwer, Alessio Zaccone, Lina Hu
Abstract: Metallic glasses possess outstanding mechanical and physical properties, making them promising candidates for advanced structural and functional applications; however, the lack of understanding and control over their glass transition and solidification processes remains a significant barrier to practical design. The glass transition from liquid to amorphous solid has remained an open problem in physics despite many theories and recent advances in computational efforts. The question of identifying a clear and well-defined diverging length scale accompanying the glass transition has remained unanswered, as has the nature of the transition and, indeed, the presence of a transition at all, as opposed to a mere dynamical crossover. Here we answer these questions using numerical results and theoretical analysis showing that, in atomic (metallic) glass formers, the glass transition coincides with, and is caused by, a continuous rigidity percolation transition from a liquid-like to a solid-like material. The transition occurs as five-fold symmetric atomic clusters progressively aggregate, forming a system-spanning rigid network that marks the onset of mechanical stability. This percolation-driven rigidity growth is accompanied by a sharp increase in the shear modulus G', indicating the emergence of macroscopic solid-like behavior. Beyond this point, which coincides with the Maxwell isostatic point of the percolating structure, dynamical arrest or "freezing-in" prevents further evolution. The long-sought diverging length scale is thus identified as the percolation-driven growth of rigid five-fold clusters, providing a direct link between local structural motifs and macroscopic mechanical properties at the glass transition. These insights offer practical routes to rationally engineer metallic glasses with targeted mechanical stiffness, hardness, and toughness.

Title: Steady state and relaxation dynamics of run and tumble particles in contact with a heat bath
Authors: R. K. Singh, Oded Farago
Abstract: We study the relaxation dynamics of a run and tumble particle in a one-dimensional piecewise linear potential $U(x)=b|x|$, from delta-function initial conditions at $x=0$ to steady state. In addition to experiencing active telegraphic noise, the particle is in contact with a heat bath at temperature $T$ that applies white thermal noise. We find that the position distribution of the RTP is described by a sum of two distributions ("modes"), each of which of the form $P(x,t\to\infty)\sim e^{-\lambda_i|x|}$ ($i=1,2$) at steady state. The two modes are dynamically coupled: At very short times ($t\to 0$), each mode stores half of the probability, and exhibits thermal diffusive spreading with a Gaussian profile. With progressing time and evolution toward steady state, the partition of probability between the modes becomes increasingly uneven and, depending on the model parameters, the mode with the smaller value of $\lambda_i$ may carry an overwhelming majority of the probability. Moreover, we identify that the characteristic relaxation time of each mode is $\tau_i=(\lambda_i^2T)^{-1}$, which implies that the minority mode also relaxes much faster than the dominant one. A more detailed analysis reveals that $\tau_i$ is characteristic of the mode relaxation only close to the origin at the core of the distribution, while further away it increases linearly with $|x|$ as if a relaxation front is propagating at constant speed $v_i^*=2\sqrt{T/\tau_i}$ in the system. The rate of non-equilibrium entropy production can be related to the two-mode splitting of the probability distribution and be expressed in terms of their correlation-lengths $\lambda_i$ and their contributions to the steady state distribution.

Title: Long-range electrical conductivity in non-$π$-conjugated organic molecular materials

Abstract: Electronic conductivity in organic materials is well-established. Moreover, semiconductive or metallic behavior in (quasi) 0-, 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional carbon-based materials has been demonstrated and understood and is nowadays widely applied in commercial devices. Despite the large structural variety, these materials commonly have an extended $\pi$-system, formed by sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, which is responsible for the conductivity. Here, we present a class of organic molecular materials that, despite the absence of an extended $\pi$-system, show a distinct direct current conductivity in quasi-1D supramolecular stacks of small organic molecules. Long-range conductivity takes place by removal of an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital, i.e. oxidation, followed by charge transfer between neighboring molecules. In thin-film devices, the resulting transport band becomes energetically accessible to charges from the contacts by interfacial dipoles stemming from a dipolar group in the molecule. Long-range order in the form of the supramolecular polymers with lengths exceeding several micrometers enhances the macroscopic conductivity but is not essential. The results presented herein show a new way to incorporate electronic functionality in organic materials and present a new class of organic conductors that lack the extended $\pi$-electron-system of conventional organic semiconductors.

Title: Reentrant localization in a quasiperiodic chain with correlated hopping sequences
Authors: Sourav Karmakar, Sudin Ganguly, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems are known to exhibit localization transitions in low dimensions, wherein all electronic states become localized beyond a critical disorder strength. Interestingly, recent studies have uncovered a reentrant localization (RL) phenomenon: upon further increasing the quasiperiodic disorder strength beyond the localization threshold, a subset of previously localized states can become delocalized again within a specific parameter window. While RL transitions have been primarily explored in systems with simple periodic modulations, such as dimerized or long-range hopping integrals, the impact of more intricate or correlated hopping structures on RL behavior remains largely elusive. In this work, we investigate the localization behavior in a one-dimensional lattice featuring staggered, correlated on-site potentials following the Aubry-André-Harper model, along with off-diagonal hopping modulations structured according to quasiperiodic Fibonacci and Bronze Mean sequences. By systematically analyzing the fractal dimension, inverse participation ratio, and normalized participation ratio, we demonstrate the occurrence of RL transitions induced purely by the interplay between quasiperiodic on-site disorder and correlated hopping. Our findings highlight the crucial role of underlying structural correlations in governing localization-delocalization transitions in low-dimensional quasiperiodic systems, where the correlated disorder manifests in both diagonal and off-diagonal terms.

Title: Chaotic magnetization dynamics in magnetic Duffing oscillator
Authors: Ryo Tatsumi, Takahiro Chiba, Takashi Komine, Hiroaki Matsueda
Abstract: We propose a magnetic analogy of the Duffing oscillator--magnetic Duffing oscillator--which is characterized by a double-well magnetic potential of a ferromagnet with a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Based on the linear stability analysis of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we show that an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the magnetic anisotropy field creates an anharmonicity on the magnetic potential, generating homoclinic orbits in the phase space. By evaluating the Lyapunov exponent, we demonstrate that the magnetic Duffing oscillator exhibits chaotic behaviors in the presence of periodically oscillating external forces: Oersted field and spin-orbit torque by considering the ferromagnet/heavy-metal bilayer. We also show that the external magnetic field can be adjusted to generate or modify homoclinic orbits, thereby controlling the parameter range of the oscillating external forces that induce chaos. This work deepens our understanding of chaotic magnetization dynamics by bridging the fields of nonlinear dynamics and spintronics.

Title: Spin-orbit interaction in square core-shell nanowires
Authors: Anna Sitek, Tudor Gabriel Dumitru, Sigurdur I. Erlingsson, Andrei Manolescu
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the spin-orbit interaction of electrons confined in the outer regions of square core-shell nanowires. The polygonal cross section leads to the accumulation of low-energy electrons in the corners and the formation of a significant energy gap that separates these corner-localized states from higher-energy states localized along the sides. We show that the low-energy states behave like the states of independent quantum wires, while the higher-energy states exhibit features characteristic of coupled wires.

Title: Probing the semiconductor-to-dirac semimetal transition in Na-Sb-Bi alloys with x-ray Compton scattering

Abstract: We discuss electron redistribution during the Semiconductor-to-Dirac Semimetal transition in Na-Sb-Bi alloys using x-ray Compton scattering experiments combined with first-principles electronic structure modeling. A robust signature of the semiconductor-to-Dirac semimetal transition is identified in the spherically averaged Compton profile. We demonstrate how the number of electrons involved in this transition can be estimated to provide a novel descriptor for quantifying the strength of spin-orbit coupling responsible for driving the transition. The associated theoretical deviation of the Born charge of Na in Na$_3$Bi from the expected ionic charge of +1 is found to be consistent with the corresponding experimental value of about 10%. Our study also shows the sensitivity of the Compton scattering technique toward capturing the spillover of Bi 6p relativistic states onto Na sites.

Title: Inertia-driven propulsion of asymmetric spinner-dimers at moderate Reynolds numbers
Authors: Zaiyi Shen, Dongfang Fu, Juho Lintuvuori
Abstract: We investigate the translational motion of rotating colloidal systems at moderate Reynolds numbers (Re), focusing on particle dimers in snowman-like configurations under three scenarios: (i) two co-rotating spheres driven by an external field, (ii) two counter-rotating spheres driven by an internal torque as a swimmer, and (iii) a single rotating spinner with a passive sphere for cargo delivery, using hydrodynamic simulations. In all the three cases, the particles are bound together hydrodynamically, and the purely rotational motion of the spinners produces a net propulsion of the dimers along the axis of rotation due to a symmetry breaking. We demonstrate tunable dynamics, where the propulsion direction of the co-rotating dimer can be reversed by tuning the aspect ratio and Reynolds number, as well as cargo transport where a dimer consisting of a single spinner and a passive cargo particle can have a sustained locomotion due to broken head-to-tail symmetry of the overall flow fields. These findings highlight the critical role of inertia in creating locomotion from rotational motion and offer new avenues for controlling and optimizing translational motion in colloidal assemblies through rotational degrees of freedom.

Title: Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation in Hybrid Normal-Superconducting Systems: The Role of superconducting coherence
Authors: Franco Mayo, Nahual Sobrino, Rosario Fazio, Fabio Taddei, Michele Governale
Abstract: We study the violation of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in hybrid superconducting systems consisting of one superconducting and two normal leads coupled to a central region containing localized levels, focusing on the role of quantum coherence. We first study the simplest setup yielding TUR violations, where the central region is a single-level quantum dot and only one normal lead is connected. In addition to the {\it classical} TUR, we consider an alternative formulation recently derived for coherent conductors. We find even the latter TUR is violated (although by a smaller extent) as a result of the macroscopic coherence related to the superconducting condensate. To support this conclusion, we connect the second normal lead as a dephasing probe, demonstrating that the violation is directly correlated with the superconducting coherence, as measured by the dot's pair amplitude. When the central region is a Cooper-pair splitter, crossed Andreev processes introduce nonlocal superconducting correlations that further enhance the quantum-TUR violation.

Title: Spatial correlations of charge density wave order across the transition in 2H-NbSe2
Authors: Seokjo Hong, Jaewhan Oh, Woohyun Cho, Soyoung Lee, Colin Ophus, Yeongkwan Kim, Heejun Yang, SungBin Lee, Yongsoo Yang
Abstract: Charge density waves (CDWs) involve coupled amplitude and phase degrees of freedom, but direct access to local amplitude correlations remains experimentally challenging. Here, we report cryogenic four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) measurements of CDW ordering in 2H-NbSe2, enabled by liquid helium-based cooling down to 20 K. By mapping the spatial distribution of CDW superlattice intensities at nanometer-scale resolution and analyzing their autocorrelations, we extract the temperature-dependent correlation length associated with the local amplitude of the CDW order parameter, independent of global phase coherence. Our results reveal that weak short-range amplitude correlations persist above the transition temperature, and grow significantly upon cooling, reaching approximately 150 nm at 20 K. These findings demonstrate clear deviations from mean-field expectations and establish 4D-STEM as a powerful tool for probing spatially inhomogeneous electronic order in quantum materials.

Title: Simplifying higher-order perturbation theory for ring-shaped Bose-Hubbard systems
Authors: Meret Preuß
Abstract: In this paper, higher-order perturbation theory is applied and tailored to one-dimensional ring-shaped Bose-Hubbard systems. Spectral and geometrical properties are used to structurally simplify the contributions and reduce computational effort without sacrificing accuracy. For this, a guide for the computation of the individual perturbational orders up to order nine is provided, alongside a both system-specific and parametrization-dependent convergence criterion. The simplification scheme described is found to be applicable to a wider class of Bose-Hubbard systems with different lattice geometries. An exemplary validation of these findings is included in the form of explicit calculations of ground state energies of the three-site Bose-Hubbard system with repulsive on-site interactions. These calculations are successfully checked against numerical computations of exact diagonalization results.

Title: Understanding Stability Mechanisms in Single-Atom Alloys with Theory-infused Deep Learning
Authors: Yang Huang, Shih-Han Wang, Shuyi Cao, Luke E. K. Achenie, Hongliang Xin
Abstract: We present an interpretable deep learning model that enhances the prediction of cohesive energy in transition metal alloys (TMAs) by incorporating cohesion theory into a graph neural network (GNN) framework. The model not only predicts the total cohesive energy-an indicator of crystal stability-but also disentangles its various contributing factors and underlying physical parameters. The physics insights extracted from the model clarify the stability trends of transition metal surfaces across the periodic table. Furthermore, by applying the model to single-atom alloys (SAAs), a class of catalytically significant next-generation TMAs, we analyze and explain the relative stability of monomer/dimer (in-plane symmetry breaking) and top-/sub-layer (out-of-plane symmetry breaking) configurations. These two types of symmetry breaking lead to distinct thermodynamic preferences in SAAs, governed by localized effects (e.g. d-orbital coupling) and delocalized effects (e.g. wavefunction renormalization). The model is thus positioned as a powerful tool for understanding and strategically designing TMAs, enabling the tailored development of materials with improved stability for advanced applications in catalysis and materials science.

Title: Subdiffusion from competition between multi-exponential friction memory and energy barriers
Authors: Anton Klimek, Benjamin A. Dalton, Roland R. Netz
Abstract: Subdiffusion is a hallmark of complex systems, ranging from protein folding to transport in viscoelastic media. However, despite its pervasiveness, the mechanistic origins of subdiffusion remain contested. Here, we analyze both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics, in the presence and absence of energy barriers, in order to disentangle the distinct contributions of memory-dependent friction and energy barriers to the emergence of subdiffusive behavior. Focusing on the mean squared displacement (MSD), we develop an analytical framework that connects subdiffusion to multiscale memory effects in the generalized Langevin equation (GLE), and derive the subdiffusive scaling behavior of the MSD for systems governed by multi-exponential memory kernels. We identify persistence and relaxation timescales that delineate dynamical regimes in which subdiffusion arises from either memory or energy barrier effects. By comparing analytical predictions with simulations, we confirm that memory dominates the overdamped dynamics for barrier heights up to approximately $2\,k_BT$, a regime recently shown to be relevant for protein folding. Overall, our results advance the theoretical understanding of anomalous diffusion and provide practical tools that are broadly applicable to fields as diverse as molecular biophysics, polymer physics, and active matter systems.

Title: Symmetry-protected electronic metastability in an optically driven cuprate ladder

M. Dean, Yao Wang, Matteo Mitrano
Abstract: Optically excited quantum materials exhibit nonequilibrium states with remarkable emergent properties, but these phenomena are usually transient, decaying on picosecond timescales and limiting practical applications. Advancing the design and control of nonequilibrium phases requires the development of targeted strategies to achieve long-lived, metastable phases. Here, we report the discovery of symmetry-protected electronic metastability in the model cuprate ladder Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$. Using femtosecond resonant x-ray scattering and spectroscopy, we show that this metastability is driven by a transfer of holes from chain-like charge reservoirs into the ladders. This ultrafast charge redistribution arises from the optical dressing and activation of a hopping pathway that is forbidden by symmetry at equilibrium. Relaxation back to the ground state is hence suppressed after the pump coherence dissipates. Our findings highlight how dressing materials with electromagnetic fields can dynamically activate terms in the electronic Hamiltonian, and provide a rational design strategy for nonequilibrium phases of matter.

Title: Mesoscopic Helices of Polar Domains in a Quadruple Perovskite
Authors: Yang Zhang, Mingyu Xu, Jie Li, Suk Hyun Sung, Sang-Wook Cheong, Weiwei Xie, Ismail El Baggari
Abstract: A significant effort in condensed matter physics is dedicated to the search for exotic arrangements of electric dipoles. Beyond collinear alignments of electric dipoles, more complex arrangements analogous to magnetic spin textures, such as polar vortices and skyrmions, have been realized. Here we report atomic-scale visualizations of a candidate for helical texture of electric dipoles, the lightly doped quadruple perovskite BiCu$_{x}$Mn$_{7-x}$O$_{12}$. Rather than forming a continuous incommensurate helical structure, this material exhibits a mesoscale ordering of ferroelastic and polar domains. Across domains, bismuth's polar displacement rotates discretely following a consistent handedness, giving rise to a mesoscale helical pattern. We observe both right-handed and left-handed chiralities associated with helical ordering. The mesoscopic helices of polar order observed in our work would provide an opportunity to realize emergent chiral-optical activity in ferroelectric crystals akin to supramolecular assemblies.

Title: Paramagnetism in spherically confined charged active matter
Authors: Balázs Németh, Ronojoy Adhikari
Abstract: The celebrated theorem of Bohr and van Leeuwen guarantees that a classical charged system cannot have a magnetization in thermal equilibrium. Quantum mechanically, however, a diamagnetic response is obtained. In contrast, we show here that a classical charged active system, consisting of a motile particle confined to the surface of a sphere, has a nonzero magnetization and a paramagnetic response. We numerically sample Langevin trajectories of this system and compare with limiting analytical solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation, at small and large temperatures, to find excellent agreement in the magnetic response. Our Letter suggests experimental routes to controlling and extracting work from charged active matter.

Title: Creating and melting a supersolid by heating a quantum dipolar system
Authors: Raúl Bombín, Jordi Boronat, Ferran Mazzanti, Juan Sánchez-Baena
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that rising the temperature of a dipolar gas under certain conditions leads to a transition to a supersolid state. Here, we employ the path integral Monte Carlo method, which exactly accounts for both thermal and correlation effects, to study that phenomenology in a system of $^{162}$Dy atoms in the canonical ensemble. Our microscopic description allows to quantitatively characterize the emergence of spatial order and superfluidity, the two ingredients that define a supersolid state. Our calculations prove that temperature on its own can promote the formation of a supersolid in a dipolar system. Furthermore, we bridge this exotic phenomenology with the more usual melting of the supersolid at a higher temperature. Our results offer insight into the interplay between thermal excitations, the dipole-dipole interaction, quantum statistics and supersolidity.

Title: Topology meets symmetry breaking: Hidden order, intrinsically gapless topological states and finite-temperature topological transitions
Authors: Reja H. Wilke, Henning Schlömer, Simon M. Linsel, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: Since the discovery of phase transitions driven by topological defects, the classification of phases of matter has been significantly extended beyond Ginzburg and Landau's paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In particular, intrinsic and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders have been discovered in (mostly gapped) quantum many-body ground states. However, these are commonly viewed as zero-temperature phenomena, and their robustness in a gapless ground state or against thermal fluctuations remains challenging to tackle. Here we introduce an explicit construction for SPT-type states with hidden order associated with SSB: They feature (quasi) long-range correlations along appropriate edges, but short-range order in the bulk; ground state degeneracy associated with SSB; and non-local string order in the bulk. We apply our construction to predict two types of finite-temperature SPT transitions, in the Ising and BKT class respectively, where the usual signs of criticality appear despite the absence of a diverging correlation length in the bulk. While the state featuring hidden Ising order is gapped, the other SPT state associated with the BKT-SPT transition has hidden $U(1)$, or XY-order and constitutes an intrinsically gapless SPT state, associated with a gapless Goldstone mode. Specifically, in this work we discuss spins with global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$ symmetry coupled to link variables constituting a loop gas model. By mapping this system to an Ising-gauge theory, we demonstrate that one of the SPT phases we construct corresponds to the Higgs-SPT phase at $T=0$ -- which we show here to remain stable at finite temperature. Our work paves the way for a more systematic search for hidden order SPT phases, including in gapless systems, and raises the question if a natural (finite-$T$) spin liquid candidate exists that realizes hidden order in the Higgs-SPT class.

Title: Crack Path Prediction with Operator Learning using Discrete Particle System data Generation
Authors: Elham Kiyani, Venkatesh Ananchaperumal, Ahmad Peyvan, Mahendaran Uchimali, Gang Li, George Em Karniadakis
Abstract: Accurately modeling crack propagation is critical for predicting failure in engineering materials and structures, where small cracks can rapidly evolve and cause catastrophic damage. The interaction of cracks with discontinuities, such as holes, significantly affects crack deflection and arrest. Recent developments in discrete particle systems with multibody interactions based on constitutive behavior have demonstrated the ability to capture crack nucleation and evolution without relying on continuum assumptions. In this work, we use data from Constitutively Informed Particle Dynamics (CPD) simulations to train operator learning models, specifically Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), which learn mappings between function spaces instead of finite-dimensional vectors. We explore two DeepONet variants: vanilla and Fusion DeepONet, for predicting time-evolving crack propagation in specimens with varying geometries. Three representative cases are studied: (i) varying notch height without active fracture; and (ii) and (iii) combinations of notch height and hole radius where dynamic fracture occurs on irregular discrete meshes. The models are trained on 32 to 45 samples, using geometric inputs in the branch network and spatial-temporal coordinates in the trunk network. Results show that Fusion DeepONet consistently outperforms the vanilla variant, with more accurate predictions especially in non-fracturing cases. Fracture-driven scenarios involving displacement and crack evolution remain more challenging. These findings highlight the potential of Fusion DeepONet to generalize across complex, geometry-varying, and time-dependent crack propagation phenomena.

Title: Luminescence thermometry based on time gates: highly sensitive approach for real time sensing and imaging
Authors: M. Szymczak, D. Szymanski, M. Piasecki, M. Brik, L. Marciniak
Abstract: Undoubtedly, one of the most significant advantages of luminescence thermometry is its ability to be used not only for spot temperature measurements but also for imaging temperature changes. Among the commonly proposed approaches, luminescence thermometry based on luminescence kinetics holds particular promise. However, most thermometric studies rely on the analysis of luminescence decay profiles, a method that significantly hinders, if not entirely precludes, real-time thermal imaging. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on the luminescence intensity ratio integrated over two temporal gates. Tests conducted on two representative phosphors, Ba2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+ and Ca2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+, demonstrate that the proposed method not only enables thermal imaging but also achieves substantially higher relative sensitivity, reaching SR=17.1 % K-1 for Ba2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+ and SR=9.4 % K-1 for Ca2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+, compared to the conventional lifetime-based approach (SR=4.2 % K-1 for Ba2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+ and SR=1.2 % K-1 for Ca2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+). Furthermore, careful selection of gate lengths allows optimization of the thermometric performance of the proposed luminescent thermometers. This approach enables expansion of the thermal operating range at the cost of relative sensitivity, providing versatility to adapt the thermometer for specific applications.

Title: DistMLIP: A Distributed Inference Platform for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Kevin Han, Bowen Deng, Amir Barati Farimani, Gerbrand Ceder
Abstract: Large-scale atomistic simulations are essential to bridge computational materials and chemistry to realistic materials and drug discovery applications. In the past few years, rapid developments of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have offered a solution to scale up quantum mechanical calculations. Parallelizing these interatomic potentials across multiple devices poses a challenging, but promising approach to further extending simulation scales to real-world applications. In this work, we present DistMLIP, an efficient distributed inference platform for MLIPs based on zero-redundancy, graph-level parallelization. In contrast to conventional space-partitioning parallelization, DistMLIP enables efficient MLIP parallelization through graph partitioning, allowing multi-device inference on flexible MLIP model architectures like multi-layer graph neural networks. DistMLIP presents an easy-to-use, flexible, plug-in interface that enables distributed inference of pre-existing MLIPs. We demonstrate DistMLIP on four widely used and state-of-the-art MLIPs: CHGNet, MACE, TensorNet, and eSEN. We show that existing foundational potentials can perform near-million-atom calculations at the scale of a few seconds on 8 GPUs with DistMLIP.

Title: 2D Entanglement from a Single Motzkin Spaghetto
Authors: Zhao Zhang
Abstract: While highly entangled ground states of gapless local Hamiltonians have been known to exist in one dimension, their 2D counterparts were only recently found, with rather sophisticated interactions involving at least 4 neighboring degrees of freedom. In this letter, a 2D lattice system interacting only between two nearest neighboring sites is proposed, which has a unique ground state with volume scaling of entanglement entropy. The system undergoes an entanglement phase transition with enhanced entanglement entropy at the critical point compared to the previous construction from coupling orthogonal arrays of one-dimensional chains, but the spectral gap in the highly entangled phase decays faster. A tensor network representation is composed of tensors with lower rank, and has a similar global geometry.

Authors: Joe Gibbs, Lukasz Cincio
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation on quantum computers is strongly constrained by gate counts, motivating techniques to reduce circuit depths. While tensor networks are natural competitors to quantum computers, we instead leverage them to support circuit design, with datasets of tensor networks enabling a unitary synthesis inspired by quantum machine learning. For a target simulation in the thermodynamic limit, translation invariance is exploited to significantly reduce the optimization complexity, avoiding a scaling with system size. Our approach finds circuits to efficiently prepare ground states, and perform time evolution on both infinite and finite systems with substantially lower gate depths than conventional Trotterized methods. In addition to reducing CNOT depths, we motivate similar utility for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms, with a demonstrated $5.2\times$ reduction in $T$-count to realize $e^{-iHt}$. The key output of our approach is the optimized unit-cell of a translation invariant circuit. This provides an advantage for Hamiltonian simulation of finite, yet arbitrarily large, systems on real quantum computers.

Title: Quantum Complexity and Chaos in Many-Qudit Doped Clifford Circuits
Authors: Beatrice Magni, Xhek Turkeshi
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.

Title: Quantum correlation beyond entanglement: Holographic discord and multipartite generalizations
Authors: Takato Mori
Abstract: While entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum theory and holography, quantum correlations arising from superposition, such as quantum discord, offer a broader perspective that has remained largely unexplored in holography. We construct gravity duals of quantum discord and classical correlation. In both holographic systems and Haar random states, discord exceeds entanglement, revealing an additional quantum correlation linked to the Markov gap and non-distillable entanglement, suggesting holographic states are intrinsically non-bipartite. In black hole setups, discord can increase despite decoherence and persists beyond the sudden death of distillable entanglement. Motivated by the holographic formula, we define reflected discord -- an optimization-free boundary quantity based on reflected entropy -- which remains effective even outside the holographic regime. We also propose several multipartite generalizations of discord, including a holography-inspired one based on multi-entropy. These results provide new tools for quantifying quantum correlations beyond entanglement in strongly coupled many-body systems and offer a novel approach to multipartite correlation measures.

Title: Kolmogorov-Arnold Wavefunctions
Authors: Paulo F. Bedaque, Jacob Cigliano, Hersh Kumar, Srijit Paul, Suryansh Rajawat
Abstract: This work investigates Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based wavefunction ansatz as viable representations for quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Through systematic analysis of one-dimensional model systems, we evaluate their computational efficiency and representational power against established methods. Our numerical experiments suggest some efficient training methods and we explore how the computational cost scales with desired precision, particle number, and system parameters. Roughly speaking, KANs seem to be 10 times cheaper computationally than other neural network based ansatz. We also introduce a novel approach for handling strong short-range potentials-a persistent challenge for many numerical techniques-which generalizes efficiently to higher-dimensional, physically relevant systems with short-ranged strong potentials common in atomic and nuclear physics.

Title: On the Discontinuous Breaking of Replica Symmetry and Shattering in Mean-Field Spin Glasses
Authors: Antonio Auffinger, Ahmed El Alaoui, Mark Sellke
Abstract: We show that in mean-field spin glasses, a discontinuous breaking of replica symmetry at the critical inverse temperature $\beta_c$ implies the existence of an intermediate shattered phase. This confirms a prediction from physics regarding the nature of random first order phase transitions. On the other hand, we give an example of a spherical spin glass which exhibits shattering, yet the transition is continuous at $\beta_c$.

Title: Analysis of in-vivo skin anisotropy using elastic wave measurements and Bayesian modelling
Authors: Matt Nagle, Susan Price, Antonia Trotta, Michel Destrade, Michael Fop, Aisling Ní Annaidh
Abstract: In vivo skin exhibits viscoelastic, hyper-elastic and non-linear characteristics. It is under a constant non-equibiaxial tension in its natural configuration and is reinforced with oriented collagen fibers, giving rise to anisotropic behaviour. Understanding the complex mechanical behaviour of skin has relevance across many sectors including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and surgery. However, there is a dearth of quality data characterizing human skin anisotropy in vivo. The available data is usually confined to limited population groups and/or limited angular resolution. Here, we use elastic waves travelling through the skin to obtain measurements from 78 volunteers from 3 to 93 years old. Using a Bayesian framework, we analyse the effect that age, gender and level of skin tension have on the skin anisotropy and stiffness. First, we propose a new measurement of anisotropy based on the eccentricity of angular data and conclude that it is a more robust measurement compared to the classic ``anisotropic ratio". We then find that in vivo skin anisotropy increases logarithmically with age, while the skin stiffness increases linearly along the direction of Langer Lines. We also conclude that gender does not significantly affect the skin anisotropy level, but does affect the overall stiffness, with males having stiffer skin on average. Finally, we find that skin tension significantly affects both the anisotropy and stiffness measurements, indicating that elastic wave measurements have promising applications in determining in vivo skin tension. In contrast to earlier studies, these results represent a comprehensive assessment of the variation of skin anisotropy with age and gender using a sizeable dataset and robust modern statistical analysis. This data has implications for the planning of surgical procedures and the adoption of universal cosmetic surgery practices for young or elderly patients.

Title: Energetics of self-organization in a dissipative two-site quantum system driven by single-photon pulses
Authors: Thiago Ganascini, Wendel Lopes da Silva, Daniel Valente
Abstract: Finding principles of nonequilibrium self-organization in dissipative quantum systems is an open problem. One example is the notion of quantum dissipative adaptation (QDA), that relates the transition probability between the ground states of a quantum system to the nonequilibrium work absorbed during the transition. However, QDA has been originally derived with three-level systems in lambda ({\Lambda}) configuration. Here, we consider a model consisting of a two-site system driven by single-photon pulses. We find that the absorbed work is generally related to the sum of {\Lambda}-type transition probabilities, instead of the direct transition probability between the two ground states. Although this is equivalent to standard QDA in most scenarios, we find an exception whereby optimal self-organization does not maximize work consumption. We show how quantum coherence leaves this kind of imprint in the energetics of self-organization in the present model.

Title: Bound excited states of Fröhlich polarons in one dimension
Authors: Jamie Taylor, Matija Čufar, David Mitrouskas, Robert Seiringer, Elke Pahl, Joachim Brand
Abstract: The one-dimensional Fröhlich model describing the motion of a single electron interacting with optical phonons is a paradigmatic model of quantum many-body physics. We predict the existence of an arbitrarily large number of bound excited states in the strong coupling limit and calculate their excitation energies. Numerical simulations of a discretized model demonstrate the complete amelioration of the projector Monte Carlo sign problem by walker annihilation in an infinite Hilbert space. They reveal the threshold for the occurrence of the first bound excited states at a value of $\alpha \approx 1.73$ for the dimensionless coupling constant. This puts the threshold into the regime of intermediate interaction strength. We calculate the spectral weight and the number density of the dressing cloud in the discretized model.

Title: Synthetic crystal rotation with spacetime metamaterials
Authors: Iñigo Liberal, Alejandro Manjavacas
Abstract: The interaction of light with rotating bodies has been historically limited to rotation frequencies much smaller than optical frequencies. Here, we investigate synthetic crystal rotations, i.e., spatiotemporal modulations mimicking the rotation of an anisotropic crystal, which grant access to large rotation frequencies. Spatiotemporal modulations change the fundamental symmetries of the electromagnetic field, breaking temporal and rotation symmetries, but preserving a spatiotemporal rotation symmetry that enforces the conservation of a combination of energy and spin angular momentum (SAM). The scattering of optical pulses by synthetically rotating crystals results in spatiotemporal light with intra-pulse SAM changes. The frequency-domain response reveals sidebands with frequency/SAM locking, and negative frequency sideband transitions for large enough rotation frequencies. Our results highlight the qualitatively different light-matter interaction regimes accessed by synthetic rotations.

Title: Polaromechanical cooling of multiple mechanical modes
Authors: Xuan Zuo, Zi-Xu Lu, Shi-Yao Zhu, Jie Li
Abstract: The strong coupling between light and matter gives rise to polaritons. Further coupling polaritons to phonons leads to the formation of hybrid polaromechanical systems. Recent experiments have achieved the strong coupling between polaritons and phonons in two different configurations, namely, the magnon-photon-phonon and exciton-photon-phonon systems, which makes it possible to prepare and control mechanical states via manipulating the polaritons. Here, we present a polaromechanical cooling theory and show how multiple mechanical modes can be simultaneously cooled by using polaritons with a single drive field. This is achieved by exploiting the great tunability of the polariton frequencies. Specifically, $N$ polaritons can be tuned to resonantly enhance the anti-Stokes scatterings associated with $N$ mechanical modes, leading to the cooling of all the mechanical modes at once. We explicitly show how such polaromechanical cooling can simultaneously cool two mechanical modes, and then discuss how to apply it to cool multiple mechanical modes and to various polaromechanical systems, such as magnon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaromechanical systems.

Abstract: Microwave quantum memory represents a critical component for the development of quantum repeaters and resource-efficient quantum processors. We report the experimental realization of a novel architecture of superconducting random access quantum memory with cycling storage time, achieved through pulsed control of an RF-SQUID coupling element. The device demonstrates a memory cycle time of 1.51 $\mu s$ and achieves 57.5\% fidelity with preservation of the input pulse shape during the first retrieval interval for near-single-photon level excitations, with subsequent exponential decay characterized by a time constant of 11.44 $\mu s$. This performance represents a several-fold improvement over previously reported implementations. Crucially, we establish that while the proposed active coupler realization introduces no measurable fidelity degradation, the primary limitation arises from impedance matching imperfections. These results highlight the potential of proposed architecture for quantum memory applications while identifying specific avenues for near-unity storage fidelity.

Title: Computational Thresholds in Multi-Modal Learning via the Spiked Matrix-Tensor Model
Authors: Hugo Tabanelli, Pierre Mergny, Lenka Zdeborova, Florent Krzakala
Abstract: We study the recovery of multiple high-dimensional signals from two noisy, correlated modalities: a spiked matrix and a spiked tensor sharing a common low-rank structure. This setting generalizes classical spiked matrix and tensor models, unveiling intricate interactions between inference channels and surprising algorithmic behaviors. Notably, while the spiked tensor model is typically intractable at low signal-to-noise ratios, its correlation with the matrix enables efficient recovery via Bayesian Approximate Message Passing, inducing staircase-like phase transitions reminiscent of neural network phenomena. In contrast, empirical risk minimization for joint learning fails: the tensor component obstructs effective matrix recovery, and joint optimization significantly degrades performance, highlighting the limitations of naive multi-modal learning. We show that a simple Sequential Curriculum Learning strategy-first recovering the matrix, then leveraging it to guide tensor recovery-resolves this bottleneck and achieves optimal weak recovery thresholds. This strategy, implementable with spectral methods, emphasizes the critical role of structural correlation and learning order in multi-modal high-dimensional inference.

Title: Expansion-contraction duality breaking in a Planck-scale sensitive cosmological quantum simulator
Authors: S. Mahesh Chandran, Uwe R. Fischer
Abstract: We propose the experimental simulation of cosmological perturbations governed by a Planck-scale induced Lorentz violating dispersion, aimed at distinguishing between early-universe models with similar power spectra. Employing a novel variant of the scaling approach for the evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate with both contact and dipolar interactions, we show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.

Title: A mesoscale phase-field model of intergranular liquid lithium corrosion of ferritic/martensitic steels
Authors: A. Lhoest, S. Kovacevic, D. Nguyen-Manh, J. Lim, E. Martínez-Pañeda, M. Wenman
Abstract: A phase-field model is developed to simulate intergranular corrosion of ferritic/martensitic steels exposed to liquid lithium. The chromium concentration of the material is used to track the mass transport within the metal and liquid (corrosive) phase. The framework naturally captures intergranular corrosion by enhancing the diffusion of chromium along grain boundaries relative to the grain bulk with no special treatment for the corrosion front evolution. The formulation applies to arbitrary 2D and 3D polycrystalline geometries. The framework reproduces experimental measurements of weight loss and corrosion depth for a 9 wt\% Cr ferritic/martensitic steel exposed to static lithium at 600 $^\circ$C. A sensitivity analysis, varying near-surface grain density, grain size, and chromium depletion thickness, highlights the microstructural influence in the corrosion process. Moreover, the significance of saturation is considered and evaluated. Simulation results show that near-surface grain density is a deciding factor, whereas grain size dictates the susceptibility to intergranular corrosion.

Title: Intrinsic Hamiltonian of Mean Force and Strong-Coupling Quantum Thermodynamics
Authors: Ignacio González, Sagnik Chakraborty, Ángel Rivas
Abstract: We present a universal thermodynamic framework for quantum systems that may be strongly coupled to thermal environments. Unlike previous approaches, our method enables a clear definition of thermostatic properties while preserving the same gauge freedoms as in the standard weak-coupling regime and retaining the von Neumann expression for thermodynamic entropy. Furthermore, it provides a formulation of general first and second laws using only variables accessible through microscopic control of the system, thereby enhancing experimental feasibility. We validate the framework by applying it to a paradigmatic model of strong coupling with a structured bosonic reservoir.

Title: Enhanced zeta potentials caused by surface ion mobilities
Authors: Evgeny S. Asmolov, Elena F. Silkina, Olga I. Vinogradova
Abstract: The electro-hydrodynamics near conducting walls is revisited. Attention is focused on the impact of an explicit diffuse Stern layer, which permittivity and viscosity differ from the bulk values, on the velocity of an electro-osmotic plug flow. To solve this problem we propose an approach of mapping the flow in the Stern layer to the surface dividing the Stern and diffuse layer, where an effective electro-hydrodynamic slip boundary condition is imposed. The latter implies that an effective surface charge is responding to the applied field and characterized by a mobility parameter $\mu \geq 1$. We derive analytic equations for $\mu$ and demonstrate that it is determined only by electrostatic properties of the electric double layer. These equations are then used to calculate electrokinetic (zeta) potentials of surfaces. We show that the zeta potential generally exceeds the surface one, which implies an amplification of the electro-osmotic flow. This effect is most pronounced if the hydrodynamic slip length is large and/or in concentrated solutions.

Title: Testing Variational Perturbation Theory for Effective Actions Using the Gaudin-Yang Model
Authors: Pranav Sharma, R. J. Furnstahl
Abstract: The background field formalism based on effective actions is a compelling framework for developing an effective field theory for nuclear density functional theory. Among the challenges in carrying out this development is handling both the particle-hole and pairing channels beyond the mean-field level, which includes how to incorporate collective degrees of freedom. Here we use the exactly solvable one-dimensional Gaudin-Yang model as a theoretical laboratory to explore candidate approaches. We compare Variational Perturbation Theory (VPT) to ordinary many-body perturbation theory and the inversion method, all to second order in their respective expansions, and verify issues with Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary fields. VPT outperforms the other approaches at this level over a wide range of densities. The next steps to extend this approach toward nuclei are outlined.

Title: Interior of a black hole in the framework of the scalar quasiparticle model
Authors: Sergey Bondarenko, Dima Cheskis, Raghvendra Singh
Abstract: We have developed an effective thermodynamic model for a black hole's interior composed of scalar quasiparticles. The proposed interior consists of a core and a crust; the properties of both depend on the kinetics of the quasiparticles. In the core, the quasiparticles possess zero classical kinetic energy; the total potential energy $U(N)$ of the core depends only on the number $N$ of quasiparticles inside it. The thermodynamic description of this state of matter requires the introduction of an inverse temperature $\beta$ inversely proportional to $U(N)$ that supplants the standard temperature in every thermodynamic relation inside the core, driving both the energy density and the pressure negative. The different states of the core, correspondingly, can be parametrized by an additional parameter, which is a mean occupation number $\eta$ of the quasiparticles in the core. Concerning the crust, there are quasiparticles in it that remain trapped by the gravitational potential at finite temperature. The no-escape condition for the quasiparticles in the crust is imposed through a truncation of the phase-space integrals, yielding a direct and analytical coupling between thermodynamics and gravity. The resulting framework unifies core and crust within a single quasiparticle description, highlights the role of negative energy and pressure in black hole interiors, and provides testable predictions for any semiclassical theory that aims to resolve the singularity problem.

Title: Integrals of motion as slow modes in dissipative many-body operator dynamics
Authors: Tian-Hua Yang, Dmitry A. Abanin
Abstract: We consider Lindbladian operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems with one or more integrals of motion (IOM), subject to weak local dissipation. We demonstrate that IOMs with small support become slow modes of these dynamics, in the sense that their Frobenius norm decays more slowly compared to generic operators. As a result, the eigenoperators of such Lindbladians with slowest decay rates have a large overlap with the IOMs of the underlying Hamiltonian. We demonstrate this correspondence between slow modes and IOMs numerically for a number of many-body models, and further corroborate it with perturbative arguments. These results open up a new method for the identification of IOMs, and provide insights into the dissipative many-body dynamics.

Title: Simulating dynamics of correlated matter with neural quantum states
Authors: Markus Schmitt, Markus Heyl
Abstract: While experimental advancements continue to expand the capabilities to control and probe non-equilibrium quantum matter at an unprecedented level, the numerical simulation of the dynamics of correlated quantum systems remains a pivotal challenge - especially in intermediate spatial dimensions. Neural quantum states are emerging as a new computational tool to investigate the time evolution of many-body quantum systems in previously inaccessible regimes. We review the recent progress in the field with a focus on the different time propagation methods, an overview of the reported applications, and a discussion of the major current challenges.

Title: Coherent and dissipative dynamics at quantum phase transitions
Authors: Davide Rossini, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: The many-body physics at quantum phase transitions shows a subtle interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations, emerging in the low-temperature limit. In this review, we first give a pedagogical introduction to the equilibrium behavior of systems in that context, whose scaling framework is essentially developed by exploiting the quantum-to-classical mapping and the renormalization-group theory of critical phenomena at continuous phase transitions. Then we specialize to protocols entailing the out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics, such as instantaneous quenches and slow passages across quantum transitions. These are mostly discussed within dynamic scaling frameworks, obtained by appropriately extending the equilibrium scaling laws. We review phenomena at first-order quantum transitions as well, whose peculiar scaling behaviors are characterized by an extreme sensitivity to the boundary conditions, giving rise to exponentials or power laws for the same bulk system. In the last part, we cover aspects related to the effects of dissipative interactions with an environment, through suitable generalizations of the dynamic scaling at quantum transitions. The presentation is limited to issues related to, and controlled by, the quantum transition developed by closed many-body systems, treating the dissipation as a perturbation of the critical regimes, as for the temperature at the zero-temperature quantum transition. We focus on the physical conditions giving rise to a nontrivial interplay between critical modes and various dissipative mechanisms, generally realized when the involved mechanism excites only the low-energy modes of the quantum transitions.

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms have been proven effective for essential quantum computation tasks such as quantum error correction and quantum control. Efficient hardware implementation of these algorithms at cryogenic temperatures is essential. Here, we utilize magnetic topological insulators as memristors (termed magnetic topological memristors) and introduce a cryogenic in-memory computing scheme based on the coexistence of the chiral edge state and the topological surface state. The memristive switching and reading of the giant anomalous Hall effect exhibit high energy efficiency, high stability, and low stochasticity. We achieve high accuracy in a proof-of-concept classification task using four magnetic topological memristors. Furthermore, our algorithm-level and circuit-level simulations of large-scale neural networks demonstrate software-level accuracy and lower energy consumption for image recognition and quantum state preparation compared with existing magnetic memristor and CMOS technologies. Our results not only showcase a new application of chiral edge states but also may inspire further topological quantum physics-based novel computing schemes.

Title: Hamiltonian transformation for accurate and efficient band structure interpolation
Authors: Kai Wu, Yingzhou Li, Wentiao Wu, Lin Lin, Wei Hu, Jinlong Yang
Abstract: Electronic band structure is a cornerstone of condensed matter physics and materials science. Conventional methods like Wannier interpolation (WI), which are commonly used to interpolate band structures onto dense k-point grids, often encounter difficulties with complex systems, such as those involving entangled bands or topological obstructions. We introduce the Hamiltonian transformation (HT) method, a novel framework that enhances interpolation accuracy by localizing the Hamiltonian. Using a pre-optimized transformation, HT produces a far more localized Hamiltonian than WI-SCDM (where Wannier functions are generated via the selected columns of the density matrix projection), achieving up to two orders of magnitude greater accuracy for entangled bands. Although HT utilizes a slightly larger, nonlocal numerical basis set, its construction is rapid and requires no optimization, resulting in significant computational speedups. These features make HT a more precise, efficient, and robust alternative to WI-SCDM for band structure interpolation, as verified by high-throughput calculations.

Title: Visualization of Strain-Induced Landau Levels in a Graphene - Black Phosphorus Heterostructure
Authors: Thi-Hai-Yen Vu, Pin Lyu, Na Hyun Jo, Chi Xuan Trang, Qile Li, Aaron Bostwick, Chris Jozwiak, Eli Rotenberg, Jiong Lu, Michael S. Fuhrer, Mark T. Edmonds
Abstract: Strain-induced pseudo magnetic fields offer the possibility of realizing zero magnetic field Quantum Hall effect in graphene, possibly up to room temperature, representing a promising avenue for lossless charge transport applications. Strain engineering on graphene has been achieved via random nanobubbles or artificial nanostructures on the substrate, but the highly localized and non-uniform pseudomagnetic fields can make spectroscopic probes of electronic structure difficult. Heterostructure engineering offers an alternative approach: By stacking graphene on top of another van der Waals material with large lattice mismatch at a desired twist angle, it is possible to generate large strain-induced pseudo magnetic fields uniformly over the entire heterostructure. Here, we report using nano-angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (nano-ARPES) to probe the electronic bandstructure of a graphene/black phosphorus heterostructure (G/BP). By directly measuring the iso-energy contours of graphene and black phosphorus we determine a twist angle of 20-degrees in our heterostructure. High-resolution nano-ARPES of the graphene bands near the Fermi level reveals the emergence of flat bands located within the Dirac cone. The spacing of the flat bands is consistent with Landau level formation in graphene, and corresponds to a pseudo-field of 11.36 T. Our work provides a new way to study quantum Hall phases induced by strain in 2D materials and heterostructures.

Title: Poisson-Nernst-Planck charging dynamics of an electric double layer capacitor: symmetric and asymmetric binary electrolytes
Authors: Ivan Palaia, Adelchi J. Asta, Megh Dutta, Patrick B. Warren, Benjamin Rotenberg, Emmanuel Trizac
Abstract: A parallel plate capacitor containing an electrolytic solution is the simplest model of a supercapacitor, or electric double layer capacitor. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for such a system, describing the mean-field charging dynamics of the capacitor, when a constant potential difference is abruptly applied to its plates. Working at constant total number of ions, we focus on the physical processes involved in the relaxation and, whenever possible, give its functional shape and exact time constants. We first review and study the case of a symmetric binary electrolyte, where we assume the two ionic species to have the same charges and diffusivities. We then relax these assumptions and present results for a generic strong (i.e. fully dissociated) binary electrolyte. At low electrolyte concentration, the relaxation is simple to understand, as the dynamics of positive and negative ions appear decoupled. At higher electrolyte concentration, we distinguish several regimes. In the linear regime (low voltages), relaxation is multi-exponential, it starts by the build-up of the equilibrium charge profile and continues with neutral mass diffusion, and the relevant time scales feature both the average and the Nernst-Hartley diffusion coefficients. In the purely nonlinear regime (intermediate voltages), the initial relaxation is slowed down exponentially due to increased capacitance, while bulk effects become more and more evident. In the fully nonlinear regime (high voltages), the dynamics of charge and mass are completely entangled and, asymptotically, the relaxation is linear in time. We finally discuss non-ideal behavior in real capacitors and provide conditions for which mean-field is expected to hold.

Title: Microscopic scales and mechanism of quantum phase transitions in two-dimensional superconducting systems
Authors: Andrey Rogachev, Samuel Feldman, Kevin Davenport
Abstract: The superconducting ground state in many two-dimensional materials can be created or destroyed through quantum phase transitions (QPTs) controlled by non-thermal parameters such as carrier density or magnetic field. While various mechanisms for these QPTs have been proposed, it remains unclear which, if any, are applicable to a specific two-dimensional superconducting system. Here, we find that a pair-breaking mechanism which suppresses the Cooper pair density gives a unifying description of magnetic-field-driven QPTs in amorphous MoGe, Pb and TaN films, and the high-temperature superconductor La$_{1.92}$Sr$_{0.08}$CuO$_{4}$. This transition occurs within the superconducting subsystem and is masked by the dominant non-critical contribution of normal electrons. The discovery was enabled by the development of a QPT model that goes beyond the conventional determination of the critical exponents and incorporates into the analysis a microscopic length scale characterizing the transitions. We found that in the materials studied, and MoGe nanowires, this scale corresponds to the size of a Cooper pair. The model has also been successfully applied to QPTs in Josephson junction arrays and various non-superconducting materials. The observation that microscopic scales are encoded in the scaled experimental data of QPTs likely extends beyond equilibrium condensed matter physics and may reveal underlying principles of critical phenomena in a wide variety of systems.

Title: Two-carrier description of cuprate superconductors from NMR
Authors: Daniel Bandur, Abigail Lee, Jakob Nachtigal, Stefan Tsankov, Juergen Haase
Abstract: Cuprates currently hold the record for the highest temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure, but the microscopic understanding of these materials remains elusive. Here we utilize nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data of planar oxygen and copper from essentially all hole-doped cuprates to provide a universal phenomenology relating the NMR spin shifts, which measure the electronic spin polarization at a given nucleus, with the superconducting dome and maximum critical temperature. We demonstrate that there are two separate contributions to the spin shift at planar copper, only one of which is seen at oxygen, and associate them with two different carrier types. Upon disentangling these two components, their relative size is shown to determine not only the doping dependence of the superconducting dome, but also the variation in maximum superconducting critical temperature, $T_\mathrm{c}$, between different families. One of these components is independent of family and resides in the hybridized planar orbitals. The second component, in contrast, has a more three-dimensional character and encodes the differences between the families. It is thus related to the charge transfer gap and planar hole sharing. Our findings offer a key, universal insight which should prove useful in the continuing development of a comprehensive theory of the cuprates, as well as an indication of how it may be possible to engineer materials with higher critical temperatures.

Title: Rigidity of Epithelial Tissues as a Double Optimization Problem
Authors: Sadjad Arzash, Indrajit Tah, Andrea J. Liu, M. Lisa Manning
Abstract: How do cells tune emergent properties at the scale of tissues? One class of such emergent behaviors are rigidity transitions, in which a tissue changes from a solid-like to a fluid-like state or vice versa. Here, we introduce a new way for a tissue described by a vertex model to tune its rigidity, by using ``tunable degrees of freedom." We use the vertex model elastic energy as a cost function and the cell stiffnesses, target shapes, and target areas as different sets of degrees of freedom describing cell-cell interactions that can be tuned to minimize the cost function. We show that the rigidity transition is unaffected when cell stiffnesses are treated as tunable degrees of freedom. When preferred shapes or areas are treated as tunable degrees of freedom, however, induced spatial correlations in target cell shapes or areas shift the rigidity transition. These observations suggest that tissues can coordinate changes in cell-scale properties, treated here as tunable degrees of freedom, to achieve desired tissue-scale behaviors.

Title: Active nematic liquid crystals under a quenched random field
Authors: Yutaka Kinoshita, Nariya Uchida
Abstract: Coupling between flow and orientation is a central issue in understanding the collective dynamics of active biofilaments and cells. Active stresses generated by motor activity destroy (quasi-)long-range orientational order and induce chaotic flows with many vortices. In cellular and subcellular environment, alignment is also hindered by heterogeneous filamentous structures in extracellular matrix and various intracellular organelles. Here we address the effects of a quenched random field on the flow patterns and orientational order in two-dimensional active nematic liquid crystals. We find that the director dynamics becomes frozen above a critical disorder strength. For sufficiently strong randomness, the orientational correlation function decays exponentially with distance, reproducing the behavior of passive random-field nematics. In contrast, the flow velocity decreases only gradually with increasing disorder, and exhibits a logarithmic spatial correlation under strong randomness. We identify the threshold between the activity- and disorder-dominated regimes and examine its dependence on the activity parameter.

Title: Universal limiting behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems with conservation laws
Authors: Joshua F. Robinson, Thomas Machon, Thomas Speck
Abstract: Making sense of complex inhomogeneous systems composed of many interacting species is a grand challenge that pervades basically all natural sciences. Phase separation and pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems have been largely studied as two separate paradigms. Here we show that in reaction-diffusion systems composed of many species, the presence of a conservation law constrains the evolution of the conserved quantity to be governed by a Cahn-Hilliard-like equation. This establishes a direct link with the paradigm of coexistence and recent "active" field theories. Hence, even for complex many-species systems a dramatically simplified but accurate description emerges over coarse spatio-temporal scales. Using the nullcline (the line of homogeneous steady states) as the central motif, we develop a geometrical framework which endows chemical space with a basis and suitable coordinates. This framework allows us to capture and understand the effect of eliminating fast non-conserved degrees of freedom, and to explicitly construct coefficients of the coarse field theory. We expect that the theory we develop here will be particularly relevant to advance our understanding of biomolecular condensates.

Title: Tunable $t-t'-U$ Hubbard models in twisted square homobilayers
Authors: P. Myles Eugenio, Zhu-Xi Luo, Ashvin Vishwanath, Pavel A. Volkov
Abstract: Square lattice Hubbard models with tunable hopping ratio $t'/t$ are highly promising for realizing a variety of quantum phases and for shedding light on key puzzles in correlated quantum materials, including higher-temperature superconductivity. We show that twisted square lattice homo-bilayers generically offer such tunability when the flat bands originate from the corner of the Brillouin zone. We reveal an emergent symmetry at low twist-angles, absent in single layers, that necessitates the vanishing of nearest neighbor hopping ($t=0$). This symmetry can be lifted by an inter-layer displacement field or by an in-plane magnetic field, introducing tunable $t$ and anisotropy, allowing access to a wide range of $t'/t$ ratios for correlated electrons on a moiré square lattice.

Title: Integrative Mobility Model For Grain-Boundary-Limited Transport In Thermoelectric Compounds
Authors: Gbadebo Taofeek Yusuf, Sukhwinder Singh, Alexandros Askounis, Zlatka Stoeva, Fideline Tchuenbou-Magaia
Abstract: Grain-boundary-limited charge transport remains a key bottleneck in polycrystalline thermoelectric materials, where reduced carrier mobility degrades electrical conductivity and suppresses the power factor. Here we present a semi-empirical mobility model that integrates three dominant grain-boundary mechanisms: (i) weighted mobility linked to carrier effective mass and concentration, (ii) thermionic emission across grain-boundary barriers, and (iii) geometric suppression arising from a finite mean free path ($\ell$). The model is validated against a diverse set of polycrystalline thermoelectric materials -- including Bi$_2$Te$_3$, PbTe, Mg$_2$Si, and SnSe -- showing excellent agreement with experiment ($R^2 = 0.93$--0.99) and yielding physically consistent parameters: $0 \lesssim \Phi_{\mathrm{GB}} \lesssim 0.15$ eV and $\ell \approx 15$--60 nm. The model captures the non-monotonic mobility trends produced by the interplay between barrier activation and phonon scattering. We further apply the model to Al-doped ZnO, revealing that combined grain-boundary passivation (reducing $\Phi_{\mathrm{GB}}$ from 0.15 eV to 0.05 eV) and moderate grain growth (increasing $\ell$ from 5 nm to 25 nm) can raise the power factor by $\sim 6\times$ (from $\sim 4$ to $\sim 26$ mW\,m$^{-1}$\,K$^{-2}$) and the electronic quality factor $B$ by nearly $7\times$ (from $\sim 0.15$ to $>1.0 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^2$\,V$^{-1}$\,s$^{-1}$\,kg$^{3/2}$), approaching values achieved in leading chalcogenide thermoelectrics. The model therefore provides a transparent and practical framework for grain-boundary engineering in oxide-based thermoelectrics.

Title: Holographic nature of critical quantum states of proteins
Authors: Eszter Papp, Gabor Vattay
Abstract: The Anderson metal-insulator transition is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics, describing the transition from a conducting (metallic) to a non-conducting (insulating) state driven by disorder in a material. At the critical point of the Anderson transition, wave functions exhibit multifractal behavior, and energy levels display a universal distribution, indicating non-trivial correlations in the eigenstates. Recent studies have shown that proteins, traditionally considered insulators, exhibit much higher conductivity than previously assumed. In this paper, we investigate several proteins known for their efficient electron transport properties. We compare their energy level statistics, eigenfunction correlation, and electron return probability to those expected in metallic, insulating, or critical states. Remarkably, these proteins exhibit properties of critically disordered metals in their natural state without any parameter adjustment. Their composition and geometry are self-organized into the critical state of the Anderson transition, and their fractal properties are universal and unique among critical systems. Our findings suggest that proteins' wave functions may fulfill ``holographic'' area laws, since their correlation fractal dimension is \(d_2\approx 2\).

Title: Fractionalization as an alternate to charge ordering in electronic insulators
Authors: Seth Musser, Meng Cheng, T. Senthil
Abstract: Incompressible insulating phases of electronic systems at partial filling of a lattice are often associated with charge ordering that breaks lattice symmetry. The resulting phases have an enlarged unit cell with an effective integer filling. Here we explore the possibility of insulating states - which we dub "Quantum Charge Liquids" (QCL) - at partial lattice filling that preserve lattice translation symmetry. Such QCL phases must necessarily either have gapped fractionally charged excitations and associated topological order or have gapless neutral excitations. We establish some general constraints on gapped fermionic QCL phases that restrict the nature of their topological order. We prove a number of results on the minimal topological order that is consistent with the lattice filling. In particular we show that at rational fillings $\nu = p/q$ with $q$ an even integer the minimal ground state degeneracy on a torus of the fermionic QCL is $4q^2$, 4 times larger than that of the bosonic QCL at the same filling. We comment on models and physical systems which may host fermionic QCL phases and discuss the phenomenology of these phases.

Title: Time-cost-error trade-off relation in thermodynamics: The third law and beyond
Authors: Tan Van Vu, Keiji Saito
Abstract: Elucidating fundamental limitations inherent in physical systems is a central subject in physics. For important thermodynamic operations such as information erasure, cooling, and copying, resources like time and energetic cost must be expended to achieve the desired outcome within a predetermined error margin. In the context of cooling, the unattainability principle of the third law of thermodynamics asserts that infinite ``resources'' are needed to reach absolute zero. However, the precise identification of relevant resources and how they jointly constrain achievable error remains unclear within the framework of stochastic and quantum thermodynamics. In this work, we introduce the concept of {\it separated states}, which consist of fully unoccupied and occupied states, and formulate the corresponding thermokinetic cost and error, thereby establishing a unifying framework for a broad class of thermodynamic operations. We then uncover a three-way trade-off relation between {\it time}, {\it cost}, and {\it error} for thermodynamic operations aimed at creating separated states, simply expressed as $\tau{C}\varepsilon_{\tau}\ge 1-\eta$. This fundamental relation is applicable to diverse thermodynamic operations, including information erasure, cooling, and copying. It provides a profound quantification of the unattainability principle in the third law of thermodynamics in a general form. Building upon this relation, we explore the quantitative limitations governing cooling operations, the preparation of separated states, and a no-go theorem for exact classical copying. Furthermore, we extend these findings to the quantum regime, encompassing both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics.

Title: Duality-preserving deformation of 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory with exact gapped ground states
Authors: Pranay Gorantla, Tzu-Chen Huang
Abstract: We propose and analyze a deformation of the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory that preserves the non-invertible Wegner duality symmetry at the self-dual point. We identify a frustration-free point along this deformation where there are nine exactly degenerate ground states (on a periodic cubic lattice) even at finite volume. One of these ground states is a trivial product state and the rest are the topologically-ordered ground states of the 3+1d toric code. We also prove that the frustration-free point is gapped in the thermodynamic limit. Our model, therefore, realizes a gapped phase with spontaneously broken Wegner duality symmetry. Furthermore, by imposing the Gauss law constraints energetically, all the above features can be realized on a tensor product Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss a generalization of this deformation to the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_N$ gauge theory and conjecture the possible phase diagram.

Title: Altermagnetic Weyl node-network semimetals protected by spin symmetry
Authors: Shuai Qu, Xiao-Yao Hou, Zheng-Xin Liu, Peng-Jie Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: Symmetry protected topology has been studied extensively in the past twenty years, but the topology protected by spin symmetry has just begun to be studied. In this work, based on spin symmetry analysis, we propose that a class of Weyl nodal line semimetals is protected by the spin symmetry. Then, by the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict that both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ are node-network semimetals protected by the spin symmetry. Moreover, both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ have nodal rings protected by the mirror symmetry and Dirac points protected by nonsymmorphic spin symmetry. Furthermore, both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ transform node-network semimetal phase into Weyl semimetal phase when considering spin-orbit coupling. Therefore, our work not only enriches the topological phases protected by spin symmetry, but also provides an excellent material platform to investigate the exotic physical properties of multiple altermagnetic topological semimetal phases in experiment.

Title: Magnon spectroscopy in the electron microscope

Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.

Title: Twist Angle Dependent Ultrafast Transient Dynamics of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals Heterostructures beyond the Exciton Mott Transition
Authors: Vikas Arora, Pramoda K Nayak, Victor S Muthu, A K Sood
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (HS) exhibit twist-angle ($\theta$) dependent interlayer charge transfer, driven by moiré potential that tunes the electronic band structure with varying $\theta$. Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.

Title: Density Matrix Renormalization Group simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard chain implementing the full SU(N) symmetry via Semi-Standard Young Tableaux and Unitary Group Subduction Coefficients
Authors: Pierre Nataf
Abstract: We have developed an efficient method for performing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard chain with open boundary conditions, fully leveraging the SU(N) symmetry of the problem. This method extends a previously developed approach for the SU(N) Heisenberg model and relies on the systematic use of the semi-standard Young tableaux (SSYT) basis in a DMRG algorithm `a la White. Specifically, the method aligns the site-by-site growth process of the infinite-size part of the DMRG, in its original formulation, with the site-by-site construction of the SSYT (or Gelfand-like) basis, based on the chain of unitary subgroups $U(1)\subset U(2) \subset U(3) \subset U(4)\cdots $. We give special emphasis to the calculation of the symmetry-resolved reduced matrix elements of the hopping terms between the left and the right block, which makes direct use of the basis of SSYT and of the Gelfand-Tsetlin coefficients, offering a computational advantage in scaling with N compared to alternative methods that rely on summing over Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Focusing on the model with homogeneous hopping between nearest neighbors, we have calculated the ground state energy as a function of U, i.e the atom-atom interaction amplitude, up to N=6 for filling 1/N (one particle per site in average), and for one atom (resp. hole) away from filling 1/N, alllowing us to compute the charge gaps, and to estimate in the thermodynamical limit, the critical value $U_c$, separating the Mott insulator from the metallic phase. Central charges c are extracted from the entanglement entropy using the Calabrese-Cardy formula, and are consistent with the theoretical predictions: c=N-1, expected from the $SU(N)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten CFTs in the spin sector for the Mott phase, and c=N in the metallic phase, reflecting the presence of one additional (charge) gapless critical mode.

Title: The SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard Model on two sites: Bethe Ansatz solution and Quantum Phase Transition of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model in the large-N limit
Authors: Pierre Nataf
Abstract: We show that the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on two sites, where N is the number of flavors of each fermion, corresponds to an exactly solvable two-level many-boson model that Richardson [J. Math. Phys. 9, 1327 (1968)] analytically solved long ago. We express the Bethe ansatz solutions as a function of the physical parameters of the SU(N) FHM, and recast its eigenvalues and eigenstates in terms of the Richardson pair energies and creation operators. In this context, the connection with the well-studied Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, known as equivalent to the Richardson model, is established and serves as a guideline to the prediction of some N-body physics phenomena in the two-site SU(N) FHM with N particles. In particular, the LMG second-order quantum phase transition (QPT) is shown to occur in the SU(N) FHM for an attractive density-density interaction U equal to U_c=-1/(2N), in units of the (absolute value of the) tunneling amplitude between the two sites. We show the finite-size energies, the gap, and the kinetic energy, which all reveal the transition, as a function of U for values of N from N = 3 to N = 36, suggesting that the QPT could be experimentally achieved with current technologies involving SU(N) ultracold atoms or molecules. Finally, we show the entanglement entropy of the first site with respect to the second, and it scales like N at the transition, in contrast with several two-mode models.

Title: Topological junction states in graphene nanoribbons: A route to topological chemistry
Authors: Hazem Abdelsalam, Domenico Corona, Renebeth B. Payod, Mahmoud A. S. Sakr, Omar H. Abd-Elkader, Qinfang Zhang, Vasil A. Saroka
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators with propagating topological edge states are promising for dissipationless transport, while their one-dimensional analogs are capable of hosting localized topological junction states that are mainly envisaged for quantum computing and spintronics. Here, in contrast, we propose to use the localized nature of topological junction states for sensing applications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. Using this classification, we theoretically model a double junction transport that shows an enhanced interaction with the NO$_2$ molecule. Our results show that topological junction states of nanoribbons can open an avenue for topological sensing and junction-assisted chemistry applications.

Title: Effect of particle and substrate wettability on evaporation-driven assembly of colloidal monolayers
Authors: Qingguang Xie, Tian Du, Christoph J. Brabec, Jens Harting
Abstract: Assembled monolayers of colloidal particles are crucial for various applications, including opto-electronics, surface engineering, as well as light harvesting, and catalysis. A common approach for self-assembly is the drying of a colloidal suspension film on a solid substrate using technologies such as printing and coating. However, this approach often presents challenges such as low surface coverage, stacking faults, and the formation of multiple layers. We numerically investigate the influence of substrate and particle wettability on the deposited pattern. Higher substrate wettability results in a monolayer with a hexagonal arrangement of deposited particles on the substrate. Conversely, lower substrate wettability leads to droplet formation after the film ruptures, leading to the formation of particle clusters. Furthermore, we reveal that higher particle wettability can mitigate the impact of the substrate wettability and facilitate the formation of highly ordered monolayers. We propose theoretical models predicting the surface coverage fraction dependent on particle volume fraction, initial film thickness, particle radius, as well as substrate and particle wettability, and validate these models with simulations. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the deposition process in the creation of assembled monolayers of colloidal particles.

Title: Derivation of the free energy, entropy and specific heat for planar Ising models: Application to Archimedean lattices and their duals
Authors: Laurent Pierre, Bernard Bernu, Laura Messio
Abstract: The 2d ferromagnetic Ising model was solved by Onsager on the square lattice in 1944, and an explicit expression of the free energy density $f$ is presently available for some other planar lattices. But an exact derivation of the critical temperature $T_c$ only requires a partial derivation of $f$. It has been performed on many lattices, including the 11 Archimedean lattices. In this article, we give general expressions of the free energy, energy, entropy and specific heat for planar lattices with a single type of non-crossing links. It is known that the specific heat exhibits a logarithmic singularity at $T_c$: $c_V(T)\sim -A\ln|1-T_c/T|$, in all the ferromagnetic and some antiferromagnetic cases. While the non-universal weight $A$ of the leading term has often been evaluated, this is not the case for the sub-leading order term $B$ such that $c_V(T)+A\ln|1-T_c/T|\sim B$, despite its strong impact on the $c_V(T)$ values in the vicinity of $T_c$, particularly important in experimental measurements. Explicit values of $T_c$, $A$, $B$ and other thermodynamic quantities are given for the Archimedean lattices and their duals for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions.

Title: Uniaxial Ordering by Self-Assembly of Isotropic Octahedral Junctions
Authors: Kazuya Saito
Abstract: We demonstrate that isotropic octahedral (sixfold branched) junctions with three diagonal endpoint pairs of different colors almost inevitably form a macroscopic assembly of uniaxial order, exhibiting the perfect order of a single color. Monte Carlo simulations of the antiferromagnetic three-state Potts model on the tripartite reo net, consisting of corner-sharing regular octahedrons, confirm this counterintuitive prediction, while showcasing switching self-assembly upon an ordering phase transition. The possible inequivalence of three directions, i.e., more symmetry breaking than uniaxiality, is found and discussed for the ordered phase of this model at finite temperatures. Some additional analyses of the model are provided, including the possibility of a metastable isotropic order, which aligns better with intuition.

Title: The Free-Energy Barrier of Precritical Nuclei in Hard Spheres is Consistent with Predictions
Authors: Lars Kürten, Antoine Castagnède, Frank Smallenburg, C. Patrick Royall
Abstract: Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on its origins, due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy. Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of pre-critical nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been successfully compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.

Title: Fast and direct preparation of a genuine lattice BEC via the quantum Mpemba effect
Authors: Philipp Westhoff, Sebastian Paeckel, Mattia Moroder
Abstract: We present an efficient method for dissipatively preparing a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) directly on a lattice, avoiding the need for a two-staged preparation procedure currently used in ultracold-atom platforms. Our protocol is based on driving the lattice-subsystem into a non-equilibrium steady state, which we show to exhibit a lattice analog of a true BEC, where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. Furthermore, exploiting a symmetry-based Mpemba effect, we analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics. This protocol paves the way to unlock the enormous potential of a dissipative preparation of highly entangled states in analog quantum simulators.

Title: Fractional Chern Insulator and Quantum Anomalous Hall Crystal in Twisted MoTe$_2$
Authors: Jialin Chen, Qiaoyi Li, Xiaoyu Wang, Wei Li
Abstract: Recent experimental advances have uncovered fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) systems, posing significant theoretical challenges in understanding the interaction effects and correlated topological phases. Here, we construct a realistic moiré lattice model tailored for tMoTe$_2$ and conduct investigations using state-of-the-art tensor-network methods. Our ground-state calculations reveal a rich array of interaction- and filling-dependent phases, including the FCI, Chern insulator, and generalized Wigner crystal, etc., explaining recent experimental observations. Moreover, we reveal quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibiting integer Hall conductivity at fractional moiré unit cell fillings, which opens new avenues for experimental exploration in tMoTe$_2$. In the FCI phase, dynamical simulations reveal a single-particle continuum with a finite charge gap, indicating the presence of fractional charge excitations. Moreover, our finite-temperature calculations determine the characteristic temperatures for charge activation and ferromagnetic (FM) transitions, consistent with experiments. We find that the charge gap is significantly larger than the energy scales of both thermal activation and FM transitions, explaining recent experimental observations. Overall, by integrating ground-state, finite-temperature, and dynamical tensor-network calculations on the real-space model, we establish a theoretical framework for understanding and exploring correlated topological phases in tMoTe$_2$ and related systems.

Title: Topological phases of coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires
Authors: Anas Abdelwahab
Abstract: The phase diagrams of arbitrary number $N_{\text{w}}$ of diagonally and perpendicularly coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires have been identified. The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. They exhibit completely flat bands at specific values of model parameters indicated by lines in the phase diagrams. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial. They reveal coherent confined correlations in the odd indexed wires with strong wire-wire coupling away from the gapless regions.

Title: The Physics of Local Optimization in Complex Disordered Systems
Authors: Mutian Shen, Gerardo Ortiz, Zhiqiao Dong, Martin Weigel, Zohar Nussinov
Abstract: Limited resources motivate decomposing large-scale problems into smaller, "local" subsystems and stitching together the so-found solutions. We explore the physics underlying this approach and discuss the concept of "local hardness", i.e., complexity from the local solver perspective, in determining the ground states of both P- and NP-hard spin-glasses and related systems. Depending on the model considered, we observe varying scaling behaviors in how errors associated with local predictions decay as a function of the size of the solved subsystem. These errors stem from global critical threshold instabilities, characterized by gapless, avalanche-like excitations that follow scale-invariant size distributions. Away from criticality, local solvers quickly achieve high accuracy, aligning closely with the results of the more computationally intensive global minimization. These findings shed light on how Nature may operate solely through local actions at her disposal.

Title: Anomalous proximity effect under Andreev and Majorana bound states
Authors: Eslam Ahmed, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: We theoretically study the anomalous proximity effect in a ballistic normal metal/diffusive normal metal/superconductor junction based on Rashba semiconductor nanowire model. The system hosts two distinct phases: a trivial helical phase with zero-energy Andreev Bound States and a topological phase with Majorana Bound States. We analyze the local density of states and induced pair correlations at the edge of the normal metal region. We investigate their behavior under scalar onsite disorder and changing the Superconductor and diffusive regions lengths in the trivial helical and topological phases. We find that both phases exhibit a zero-energy peak in the local density of states and spin-triplet pair correlations in the clean limit, which we attribute primarily to odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs. Disorder rapidly splits the zero-energy peak in the trivial helical phase regardless of the lengths of the superconductor and diffusive normal regions. The zero-energy peak in the topological phase show similar fragility when the superconductor region is short. However, for long superconductor regions, the zero-energy peak in the topological phase remain robust against disorder. In contrast, spin-singlet correlations are suppressed near zero energy in both phases. Our results highlight that the robustness of the zero-energy peak against scalar disorder, contingent on the Superconductor region length, serves as a key indicator distinguishing trivial Andreev bound states from topological Majorana bound states.

Title: Mapping of Microstructure Transitions during Rapid Alloy Solidification Using Bayesian-Guided Phase-Field Simulations
Authors: José Mancias, Brent Vela, Juan Flórez-Coronel, Rouhollah Tavakoli, Douglas Allaire, Raymundo Arróyave, Damien Tourret
Abstract: This study addresses microstructure selection mechanisms in rapid solidification, specifically targeting the transition from cellular/dendritic to planar interface morphologies under conditions relevant to additive manufacturing. We use a phase-field model that quantitatively captures solute trapping, kinetic undercooling, and morphological instabilities across a broad range of growth velocities ($V$) and thermal gradients ($G$), and apply it to a binary Fe-Cr alloy, as a surrogate for 316L stainless steel. By combining high-fidelity phase-field simulations with a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian active learning approach, we efficiently map the microstructure transitions in the multi-dimensional space of composition, growth velocity, and temperature gradient. We compare our PF results to classical theories for rapid solidification. The classical KGT model yields an accurate prediction of the value of $G$ above which the interface is planar for any growth velocity. Microstructures transition from dendrites to cells as the temperature gradient increases close to this value of $G$. We also identify the occurrence of unstable "intermediate" microstructures at the border between dendritic and planar at low $G$, in the absence of banding instability in this Fe-Cr alloy. Our results highlight the capabilities of Bayesian-guided PF approaches in exploring complex microstructural transitions in multidimensional parameters spaces, thereby providing a robust computational tool for designing process parameters to achieve targeted microstructures and properties in rapidly solidified metallic alloys.

Title: Absolute measurement of the exchange interaction in an InSb quantum well using Landau-level tunnelling spectroscopy
Authors: S.K. Clowes, C.P. Allford, D. Shearer, G.V. Smith, R. Simmons, B.N. Murdin, U. Zeitler, P.D. Buckle
Abstract: We studied InSb quantum well devices using Landau level tunneling spectroscopy through a three-terminal differential conductance technique. This method is similar to filled state scanning tunneling microscopy but uses a stationary contact instead of a mobile tip to analyze the two-dimensional electron system. Applying magnetic fields up to 15 T, we identified clear peaks in the differential current-voltage profiles, indicative of Landau level formation. By examining deviations from the expected Landau fan diagram, we extract an absolute value for the exchange-induced energy shift. Through an empirical analysis, we derive a formula describing the exchange shift as a function of both magnetic field strength and electron filling. Our findings indicate that the emptying of the $\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$ Landau levels causes an exchange interaction energy shift in the $\nu=1$ level. Unlike prior studies that infer level energies relative to one another and report oscillatory g-factor behavior, our method references the energy of the Landau levels above the filled states of the contact under a bias voltage, revealing that only the ground state Landau level experiences a measurable exchange shift.

Title: Electronic mobility, doping, and defects in epitaxial $\mathrm{BaZrS_3}$ chalcogenide perovskite thin films
Authors: Jack Van Sambeek, Jessica Dong, Anton V. Ievlev, Tao Cai, Ida Sadeghi, Rafael Jaramillo
Abstract: We present the electronic transport properties of $\mathrm{BaZrS_3}$ (BZS) thin films grown epitaxially by gas-source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We observe n-type behavior in all samples, with carrier concentration ranging from $4 \times 10^{18}$ to $4 \times 10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ at room temperature (RT). We observe a champion RT Hall mobility of 11.1 $\mathrm{cm^2V^{-1}s^{-1}}$, which is competitive with established thin-film photovoltaic (PV) absorbers. Temperature-dependent Hall mobility data show that phonon scattering dominates at room temperature, in agreement with computational predictions. X-ray diffraction data illustrate a correlation between mobility and stacking fault concentration, illustrating how microstructure can affect transport. Despite the well-established environmental stability of chalcogenide perovskites, we observe significant changes to electronic properties as a function of storage time in ambient conditions. With the help of secondary-ion mass-spectrometry (SIMS) measurements, we propose and support a defect mechanism that explains this behavior: as-grown films have a high concentration of sulfur vacancies that are shallow donors ($\mathrm{V_S^\bullet}$ or $\mathrm{V_S^{\bullet \bullet}}$), which are converted into neutral oxygen defects ($\mathrm{O_S^\times}$) upon air exposure. We discuss the relevance of this defect mechanism within the larger context of chalcogenide perovskite research, and we identify means to stabilize the electronic properties.

Title: Lieb-Mattis ordering theorem of electronic energy levels in the thermodynamic limit
Authors: Manuel Calixto, Alberto Mayorgas, Julio Guerrero
Abstract: Lieb-Mattis theorem orders the lowest-energy states of total spin $s$ of a system of $P$ interacting fermions. We generalize these predictions to fermionic mixtures of $P$ particles with more than $N=2$ spinor components/species in the thermodynamic limit $P\to\infty$. The lowest-energy state inside each permutation symmetry sector $h$, arising in the $P$-fold tensor product decomposition, is well approximated by a U$(N)$ coherent (quasi-classical, variational) state, specially in the limit $P\to\infty$. In particular, the ground state of the system belongs the most symmetric (dominant Young tableau $h_0$) configuration. We exemplify our construction with the $N=3$ level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, with a previous motivation on pairing correlations and U$(N)$-invariant quantum Hall ferromagnets. In the limit $P\to\infty$, each lowest-energy state within each permutation symmetry sector $h$ undergoes a quantum phase transition for a critical value $\lambda_c(h)$ of the exchange coupling constant $\lambda$, depending on $h$. This generalizes standard quantum phase transitions and their phase diagrams corresponding to the ground state belonging to the most symmetric sector $h_0$.

Title: Longitudinal magnetoconductivity in chiral multifold semimetals exemplified by pseudospin-1 nodal points
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We embark on computing the longitudinal magnetoconductivity within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, where an isotropic triple-point semimetal (TSM) is subjected to collinear electric ($\boldsymbol E $) and magnetic ($\boldsymbol B$) fields. Except for the Drude part, the $B$-dependence arises exclusively from topological properties like the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. We solve the Boltzmann equations exactly in the linear-response regime, applicable in the limit of weak/nonquantising magnetic fields. The novelty of our investigation lies in the consideration of the truly multifold character of the TSMs, where the so-called flat-band (flatness being merely an artifact of linear-order approximations) is made dispersive by incorporating the appropriate quadratic-in-momentum correction in the effective Hamiltonian. It necessitates the consideration of interband scatterings within the same node as well, providing a complex interplay of intraband, interband, intranode, and internode processes, offering an overwhelmingly rich set of possibilities. The exact results are compared with those obtained from a naive relaxation-time approximation.

Title: V. J. Emery and P. W. Anderson's views and related issues regarding the basics of cuprates: a re-look
Authors: Navinder Singh
Abstract: In 1991, V. J. Emery in his important review article entitled "Some aspects of the theory of high temperature superconductors"\cite{emery1} argued against the Zhang-Rice reduction of three-band to an effective one-band model. In his words "...therefore it seems that the simple $t-J$ model does not account for the properties of high temperature superconductors". Over approximately 35 years after the initial debates\cite{debates} much has happened in the field pertaining to this topic. Even though it is one of the most discussed issue, a comprehensive account and the required resolution are lacking. Connected to the debate over one-band versus three-band models is another discussion: the one-component versus two-component model for cuprates. The two-component model is most strongly advocated by Barzykin and Pines\cite{bp}. In this article the author attempts a perspective and a re-look on some of these issues. After an analysis of a large body of literature, author finds that V. J. Emery's criticism of the Zhang-Rice reduction was correct. Many central experimental features of cuprates cannot be rationalized within the one-band model, and Johnston-Nakano scaling is one such example. Other examples are also discussed. Author introduces a simple-minded toy model to illustrate the core issues involved.

Title: Sliding Ferroelectrics Induced Hybrid-Order Topological Phase Transitions
Authors: Ning-Jing Yang, Jian-Min Zhang, Xiao-Ping Li, Zeying Zhang, Zhi-Ming Yu, Zhigao Huang, Yugui Yao
Abstract: We propose ferroelectric layer sliding as a new approach to realize and manipulate topological quantum states in two-dimensional (2D) bilayer magnetic van der Waals materials. We show that stacking monolayer ferromagnetic topological states into layer-spin-locked bilayer antiferromagnetic structures, and introducing sliding ferroelectricity leads to asynchronous topological evolution of different layers (spins) owing to existence of polarization potentials, thereby giving rise to rich layer-resolved topological phases. As a specific example, by means of a lattice model, we show that a bilayer magnetic 2D second order topological insulator (SOTI) reveals an unrecognized spin-hybrid-order topological insulator after undergoing ferroelectric sliding. Interestingly, in such phase, the spin-up (top layer) and spin-down (bottom layer) channels exhibit first-order and second-order topological properties, respectively. Moreover, other topological phases such as SOTI, quantum spin Hall insulator, quantum anomalous Hall insulator, and trivial insulator can also emerge through changes in the parameters of the system, and the relevant topological indices are also discussed. In terms of materials, based on first principles calculations, we predict material ScI2 can serve as an ideal platform to realize our proposal. Further, we predict that the anomalous Nernst effect of these several topological phases exhibits distinct differences, and therefore can be used as a signal for experimentally probing.

Title: Fully characterized linear magnetoelectric response of 2D monolayers from high-throughput first-principles calculations
Authors: John Mangeri, Thomas Olsen
Abstract: We screen 4784 stable monolayers from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) and identify 57 ferromagnetic (FM) and 67 antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds that should exhibit linear magnetoelectric (ME) effects. Using density functional theory, we compute contributions from the spin and orbital angular momentum as well as lattice-mediated and clamped-ion analogs to fully characterize the linear ME tensor in the static limit. We observe a general trend that AFM ordering gives rise to a larger ME response compared to FM ordered monolayers. Using a typical van der Waals interlayer distance, we find that AFM $\mathrm{Mn}_2\mathrm{SI}_2$ exhibits the strongest component of linear ME response, providing approximately 580 ps/m. This is two orders of magnitude greater than in prototypical $\mathrm{Cr}_2\mathrm{O}_3$ but comparable to the largest ME response measured in bulk $\mathrm{TbPO}_4$ (280-740 ps/m). We also search for antimagnetoelectricity and find a number of FM and AFM compounds with antiferroic tensor entries. By demonstration of select examples and analysis of our full data set, we argue that inclusion of all contributions (spin, orbital, lattice-mediated and clamped-ion) is of crucial importance for reliable predictions of the total ME response.

Title: Multi-mode NOON states generation with ultracold atoms via geodesic counterdiabatic driving
Authors: Simon Dengis, Sandro Wimberger, Peter Schlagheck
Abstract: We present a protocol for the generation of NOON states with ultracold atoms, leveraging the Bose-Hubbard model in the self-trapping regime. By the means of an optimized adiabatic protocol, we achieve a significant reduction in the time required for the preparation of highly entangled NOON states, involving two or more modes. Our method saturates the quantum speed limit, ensuring both efficiency and high fidelity in state preparation. A detailed analysis of the geodesic counterdiabatic driving protocol and its application to the Bose-Hubbard system highlights its ability to expand the energy gap, facilitating faster adiabatic evolution. Through perturbation theory, we derive effective parameters that emulate the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, enabling experimentally viable implementations with constant physical parameters. This approach is demonstrated to yield exponential time savings compared to standard geodesic driving, making it a powerful tool for creating complex entangled states for applications in quantum metrology and quantum information. Our findings pave the way for scalable and precise quantum state control in ultracold atomic systems.

Title: Charging dynamics of electric double layer nanocapacitors in mean-field
Authors: Ivan Palaia, Adelchi J. Asta, Megh Dutta, Patrick B. Warren, Benjamin Rotenberg, Emmanuel Trizac
Abstract: An electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) stores energy by modulating the spatial distribution of ions in the electrolytic solution that it contains. We determine the mean-field time scales for planar EDLC relaxation to equilibrium, after a potential difference is applied. We tackle first the fully symmetric case, where positive and negative ionic species have same valence and diffusivity, and then the general, more complex, asymmetric case. Depending on applied voltage and salt concentration, different regimes appear, revealing a remarkably rich phenomenology relevant for nanocapacitors.

Title: Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: II. Modeling the dynamics of radiationless transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain
Authors: Józef Kuśba
Abstract: To determine the effect of nonradiative excitation energy transfer on the fluorescence of a rigid multicomponent solution, a new analytical method was developed by treating this transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain (TRMC). In the TRMC approach, we assume that the Markov chain under consideration is governed by bivariate joint probability mass-density functions. One of the random variables is discrete and represents the state number to which the process passes at a given step, while the other random variable is continuous and determines the moment in time at which this transition occurs. In general, the time distributions of this second variable can be arbitrary, continuous or discrete, and not just exponential, as required by the method known as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC). The agreement between the basic expressions of the TRMC method and the analogous expressions of the renewal theory has been demonstrated. The correctness of the TRMC method is confirmed by the fact that the time courses of fluorescence intensities calculated by this method agree with those calculated using ordinary analytical methods. In the section on calculating the quantum yields of individual components, the suitability of a method known as discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) was found. However, we argue that the DTMC method does not refer to time and propose to rename it as time-unspecified Markov chain (TUMC). The results generated by TRMC, when integrated over time, become equivalent to those generated by TUMC. The fluorescence cases of binary and ternary solutions are discussed in detail.

Title: Photoluminescence-Based Gas Sensing with MoS2 Monolayers
Authors: Gia Quyet Ngo, Chanaprom Cholsuk, Sebastian Thiele, Ziyang Gan, Antony George, Joerg Pezoldt, Andrey Turchanin, Tobias Vogl, Falk Eilenberger
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are highly appealing for gas sensors, lab-on-a-chip devices and bio-sensing applications because of their strong light-matter interaction and high surface-to-volume ratio. The ability to grow these van der Waals materials on different substrates and waveguide geometries opens a horizon toward scalable on-chip photonic nanodevices. Here, we report on a versatile technique for real time remote optical gas sensing using two-dimensional TMDs. The adsorption of the gas molecules on the monolayer surface provides a gateway for gas sensing based on charge-transfer-induced photoluminescence variation. For gases that are weakly adsorbed on the surface of monolayer TMDs, purging the monolayers' surface by an inert gas like N2 can desorb gases from the monolayers at room temperature. We demonstrate CO, NO and NO2 detection by monitoring photoluminescence from semiconducting MoS2 monolayers grown on SiO2/Si chips at a level of 10 ppm with fast response time. Observations are supported by our density functional theory calculations, which predict a significant interaction between these gases and MoS2 monolayers. These findings may lead to advances in remote sensing, surface-sensitive bioanalytics and lab-on-a-chip sensors.

Title: Effective (Floquet) Lindblad generators from spectral unwinding
Authors: Görkem D. Dinc, André Eckardt, Alexander Schnell
Abstract: A mathematical description of the reduced dynamics of an open quantum system can often be given in terms of a completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) map, also known as quantum channel. In a seminal work by Wolf et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 150402 (2008)], it was shown that deciding whether a given quantum channel was generated from an underlying effective Markovian dynamics, with time-independent generator of Lindblad form, is generally an NP-hard problem. The difficulty is related to the fact that one has to search through all possible branches of the operator logarithm of the map, in order to identify, if any of the resulting effective generators is of Lindblad form. In this work we show that in cases where one has access to the full reduced dynamics at all previous times (the dynamical map) one can significantly facilitate the search for an effective generator by making use of Floquet theory. By performing a spectral unwinding such that the effective micromotion is minimized, the effective Floquet generator is often an excellent candidate for an effective generator of Lindblad form. This significantly reduces the complexity of the search for an effective generator of Lindblad form in many (though not all) cases. Our results are relevant for engineering Floquet Lindbladians in complex many-body systems.

Title: Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time
Authors: Miguel A. González-Casado, Andreia Sofia Teixeira, Angel Sánchez
Abstract: How do networks of relationships evolve over time? We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.

Title: Quasi-electrostatic eigenmode analysis of anisotropic particles
Authors: Asaf Farhi, Haim Suchowski
Abstract: Anisotropic subwavelength particles combine the strong response and tunability of nanostructures with the exotic properties of anisotropic materials. Here we derive closed-form expressions for the quasielectrostatic eigenmodes and eigenpermittivity relations of uniaxial and biaxial spheres and ellipsoids. We show that such particles exhibit novel radiation patterns and axial-eigenpermittivity sum rules, resulting in resonance splitting and eigenvalue degeneracy. Finally, we analytically predict the Q-factors of the resonance peaks. Our results pave the way for a new generation of directional and multispectral detectors and biomarkers and apply to other fields of physics.

Title: A local automaton for the 2D toric code
Authors: Shankar Balasubramanian, Margarita Davydova, Ethan Lake
Abstract: We construct a local decoder for the 2D toric code using ideas from the hierarchical classical cellular automata of Tsirelson and Gács. Our decoder is a circuit of strictly local quantum operations preserving a logical state for exponential time in the presence of circuit-level noise without the need for non-local classical computation or communication. Our construction is not translation invariant in spacetime, but can be made time-translation invariant in 3D with stacks of 2D toric codes. This solves the open problem of constructing a local topological quantum memory below four dimensions.

Abstract: Phase reconstruction is important in transmission electron microscopy for structural studies. We describe electron Fourier ptychography and its application to phase reconstruction of both radiation-resistant and beam-sensitive materials. We demonstrate that the phase of the exit wave can be reconstructed to high resolution using a modified iterative phase retrieval algorithm using data collected in an alternative optical geometry. This method achieves a spatial resolution of 0.63 nm at a fluence of $4.5 \times 10^2 \, e^-/\text{nm}^2$, as validated on Cry11Aa protein crystals under cryogenic conditions. Notably, this method requires no additional hardware modifications, is straightforward to implement, and can be seamlessly integrated with existing data collection software, providing a broadly accessible alternative approach to structural studies.

Title: Temporal CW polarization-tomography of photon pairs from the biexciton radiative cascade: theory and experiment
Authors: Noam Tur, Ismail Nassar, Ido Schwartz, Joseph Avron, Dan Dalacu, Philip J. Poole, David Gershoni
Abstract: We study, experimentally and theoretically, temporal correlations between the polarization of photon pairs emitted during the biexciton-exciton radiative cascade from a single semiconductor quantum dot, optically excited by a continuous-wave light source. The system is modeled by a Lindbladian coupled to two Markovian baths: One bath represents the continuous light source, and a second represents the emitted radiation. Very good agreement is obtained between the theoretical model that we constructed and a set of 36 different time resolved, polarization correlation measurements between cascading photon pairs.

Title: Observing dynamics of distinct structural transitions in trapped-ion clusters
Authors: Akhil Ayyadevara, Anand Prakash, Shovan Dutta, Arun Paramekanti, S. A. Rangwala
Abstract: Interacting many-particle systems can self-organize into a rich variety of crystalline structures. While symmetry provides a powerful framework for predicting whether structural transitions between crystal states are continuous or discontinuous, collective lattice dynamics offer complementary insights into the microscopic mechanisms that drive these transitions. Trapped laser-cooled ions present a pristine and highly controllable few-body system for studying this interplay of symmetry and dynamics. Here, we use real-time fluorescence imaging while deforming the trap potential to observe a variety of structural transitions in three-dimensional unit-cell-sized ion clusters. We probe their distinct dynamical signatures: mode softening indicating a structural instability at a symmetry-breaking continuous transition, stochastic switching between stable structures at a discontinuous transition, and hysteresis near a spinodal point. We also observe a remarkable triple point-like feature where a discontinuous symmetry-changing transition and a continuous symmetry-breaking transition occur simultaneously. Analytical calculations based on symmetry considerations and numerical analysis of collective modes provide a comprehensive understanding of the observed dynamics. Our results demonstrate that tunable Coulomb clusters serve as a versatile platform to elucidate the interplay between symmetry, energy landscapes, and dynamical pathways in structural transitions.

Title: On the transmission of texts: written cultures as complex systems
Authors: Jean-Baptiste Camps, Julien Randon-Furling, Ulysse Godreau
Abstract: Our knowledge of past cultures relies considerably on written material. For centuries, texts have been copied, altered, then transmitted or lost - eventually, from surviving documents, philologists attempt to reconstruct text phylogenies ("stemmata"), and past written cultures. Nonetheless, fundamental questions on the extent of losses, representativeness of surviving artefacts, and the dynamics of text genealogies have remained open since the earliest days of philology. To address these, we radically rethink the study of text transmission through a complexity science approach, integrating stochastic modelling, computer simulations, and data analysis, in a parsimonious mindset akin to statistical physics and evolutionary biology. Thus, we design models that are simple and general, while accounting for diachrony and other key aspects of the dynamical process underlying text phylogenies, such as the extinction of entire branches or trees. On the well-known case study of Medieval French chivalric literature, we find that up to 60% of texts and 99% of manuscripts were lost (consistent with recent synchronic "biodiversity" analyses). We also settle a hundred-year-old controversy on the bifidity of stemmata. Further, our null model suggests that pure chance ("drift") is not the only mechanism at play, and we provide a theoretical and empirical framework for future investigation.
