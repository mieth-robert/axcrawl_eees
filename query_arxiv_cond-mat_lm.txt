Title: Resolving the phase of a Dirac topological state via interferometric photoemission
Authors: Shiri Gvishi, Ittai Sidilkover, Shaked Rosenstein, Nir Hen Levin, Adi Peled, Omer Pasternak, Costel R. Rotundu, Ido Biran, Semën Gorfman, Naaman Amer, Hadas Soifer
Abstract: The electronic wavefunction is at the heart of physical phenomena, defining the frontiers of quantum materials research. While the amplitude of the electron wavefunction in crystals can be measured with state-of-the-art probes in unprecedented resolution, its phase has remained largely inaccessible, obscuring rich electronic information. Here we develop a quantum-path electron interferometer based on time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that enables the reconstruction of the phase of electronic states in quantum materials - with energy and momentum resolution. We demonstrate the scheme by resolving the phase along the Dirac electronic band of a prototypical topological insulator and observe a resonance-associated phase jump as well as a momentum and phase synchronized inversion revealing the helicity of the Dirac cone. We show the interferometer can be optically controlled by the polarization of the absorbed light, allowing a differential measurement of the phase - a crucial component for extracting phase information from an interferogram. This photo-electron-interferometer is a purely experimental scheme and does not rely on any specific theoretical model. It can be extended to a variety of materials, opening up the phase dimension in quantum materials research.

Title: Superdiffusive transport protected by topology and symmetry in all dimensions
Authors: Shaofeng Huang, Yu-Peng Wang, Jie Ren, Chen Fang
Abstract: Superdiffusion is an anomalous transport behavior. Recently, a new mechanism, termed the ``nodal mechanism," has been proposed to induce superdiffusion in quantum models. However, existing realizations of the nodal mechanism have so far been proposed on fine-tuned, artificial Hamiltonians, posing a significant challenge for experimental observation. In this work, we propose a broad class of models for generating superdiffusion potentially realizable in condensed matter systems across different spatial dimensions. A robust nodal structure emerges from the hybridization between the itinerant electrons and the local impurity orbitals, protected by the intrinsic symmetry and topology of the electronic band. We derive a universal scaling law for the conductance, $G \sim L^{-\gamma}$, revealing how the exponent is dictated by the dimensionality of the nodal structure ($D_{\text{node}}$) and its order $n$, and the dimensionality of the system $(D)$ at high temperatures or that of the Fermi surface ($D^F$) at low temperatures. Through numerical simulations, we validate these scaling relations at zero temperature for various models, including those based on graphene and multi-Weyl semimetals, finding excellent agreement between our theory and the computed exponents. Beyond the scaling of conductance, our framework predicts a suite of experimentally verifiable signatures, notably a new mechanism for linear-in-temperature resistivity ($\rho \sim T$) and a divergent low-frequency optical conductivity ($\sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^{\gamma -1}$), establishing a practical route to discovering and engineering anomalous transport in quantum materials.

Title: Nonequilibrium Probes of Quantum Geometry in Gapless Systems
Authors: Bastien Lapierre, Per Moosavi, Blagoje Oblak
Abstract: Much of our understanding of gapless many-body quantum systems stems from their low-energy descriptions as conformal field theories. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the associated quantum geometry by considering finite systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry. This is supported by both analytical results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, and numerical simulations of gapless lattice models.

Title: Functional renormalization group study of a dissipative Bose--Hubbard model
Authors: Oscar Bouverot-Dupuis, Vincent Grison, Nicolas Paris
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of a one-dimensional dissipative Bose-Hubbard model using the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (FRG). Each lattice site is coupled to an independent bath, generating long-range temporal interactions that encode non-Markovian dissipation. For a broad class of bath spectra -- ohmic, sub-ohmic, and super-ohmic -- we identify two competing low-energy regimes: a Luttinger-liquid line of fixed points and a dissipative fixed point characterized by finite compressibility, vanishing superfluid stiffness, and universal scaling exponents, separated by a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The FRG framework is essential here, as it provides access to the complete renormalization group flow and all fixed points from a single microscopic action, beyond the reach of perturbative or variational methods. This work establishes a unified and systematically improvable framework for describing dissipative quantum phases in one dimension.

Title: Green Function Invariants for Floquet Topological Superconductivity Induced by Proximity Effects
Authors: Mohamed Assili, Panagiotis Kotetes
Abstract: We bring forward a Green function approach for the prediction of Floquet topological phases in driven superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. Although it is common to treat the superconducting component as a mere Cooper-pair reservoir, it was recently pointed out that such an approximation breaks down in the presence of driving, due to the emergence of level broadening. Here, we go beyond these recent works and prescribe how to construct the Floquet topological invariants for such driven hybrids. Specifically, we propose to first obtain the midgap quasi-energy spectra by including the hermitian part of the semiconductor's self-energy and, subsequently, read out the respective level broadenings by projecting the anti-hermitian part of the self-energy onto the quasi-energy eigenvectors. We exemplify our approach for a Rashba nanowire coupled to a superconductor and a time-dependent Zeeman field. Using our method, we obtain the Floquet band structure, the respective level broadenings, and the topological invariants. Our analysis reinforces the need to properly account for the self-energy, and corroborates that broadening effects can hinder the observation of the Floquet topological phases and especially of those harboring Majorana $\pi$ modes.

Title: Electrostatic, Luminescent, and Paramagnetic Responses of Fresh BN Nanopowders Synthesized under Concentrated Light
Authors: Lina Sartinska
Abstract: This study explores the properties of nanopowders synthesized under high-temperature, non-equilibrium conditions in a high-flux optical furnace in a nitrogen flow. Boron powders served as the starting material, and the intense thermal gradients during synthesis led to incomplete chemical reactions. As a result, the surface of the resulting nanoparticles is covered with a thin layer of sassolite, followed by boron oxides, beneath which lies a boron nitride shell. The subsurface contains boron-rich nitride phases, while the core consists of elemental boron. For reference, commercial platelet-like h-BN powders from the "Chempur" company were also analyzed. Initially, all synthesized nanopowders displayed pronounced electrostatic charging, photoluminescence (PL), and paramagnetic activity, attributable to high surface defect densities and unsaturated chemical bonds. However, after two years of exposure to ambient air, these nanopowders exhibited complete loss of electrostatic charging, absence of photoluminescence (PL), and disappearance of the characteristic single EPR resonance line. Similarly, commercial h-BN nanopowder from the "Chempur" company does not exhibit a single EPR resonance line too. FTIR analysis revealed progressive surface oxidation and hydroxylation of this powder, suggesting that atmospheric moisture and oxygen effectively passivated defect states. These findings underscore the critical role of surface chemistry in governing the electrostatic, optical, and magnetic behavior of BN-based nanomaterials and highlight the importance of defect stabilization for preserving functional properties over time.

Title: Probing Topological Stability with Nonlocal Quantum Geometric Markers
Authors: Quentin Marsal, Hui Liu, Emil J. Bergholtz, Annica M. Black-Schaffer
Abstract: Spatially resolved local quantum geometric markers play a crucial role in the diagnosis of topological phases without long-range translational symmetry, including amorphous systems. Here, we focus on the nonlocality of such markers. We demonstrate that they behave as correlation functions independently of the material's structure, showing sharp variations in the vicinity of topological transitions and exhibiting a unique pattern in real space for each transition. Notably, we find that, even within the same Altland-Zirnbauer class, distinct topological transitions generate qualitatively different spatial signatures, enabling a refined, class-internal probe of topological stability. As such, nonlocal quantum geometric indicators provide a more efficient and versatile tool to understand and predict the stability of topological phase transitions.

Title: pH Regulates Ion Dynamics in Carboxylated Mixed Conductors

Abstract: Coupled ionic and electronic transport underpins processes as diverse as electrochemical energy conversion, biological signaling, and soft adaptive electronics. Yet, how chemical environments such as pH modulate this coupling at the molecular scale remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the protonation state of carboxylated polythiophenes provides precise chemical control over ion dynamics, doping efficiency, solvent uptake and mechanical response. The findings establish molecular acidity as a general strategy to program ionic preference and mechanical stability, offering design principles for pH-responsive mixed conductors and soft electronic materials that couple ionic, electronic, and mechanical functionality.

Title: Time-Dependent Oxidation and Scale Evolution of a Wrought Co/Ni-based Superalloy
Authors: Cameron Crabb, Zachary. T. Kloenne, Samuel. R. Rogers, Chi-Hang. D. Kwok, Michelle. S. Conroy, David. Dye
Abstract: Understanding how protective oxide scales evolve over time is necessary for improving the long term resistance of superalloys. This work investigates the time-dependent oxidation behavior of an ingot-processable Co/Ni-based superalloy oxidized in air at $800~^\circ\mathrm{C}$ for $20$, $100$, and $1000~\mathrm{h}$ . Mass-gain and white-light interferometry measurements quantified oxidation kinetics, surface roughness, and spallation, while high-resolution STEM-EDX characterized oxide morphology and nanoscale elemental partitioning. Atom probe tomography captured the key transition regions between the chromia and alumina scales, and X-ray diffraction was used to identify a gradual transition from NiO and (Ni,Co)-spinel phases to a compact, dual phase chromia and alumina-rich scale. The oxidation rate evolved from near-linear to parabolic behavior with time, consistent with diffusion-controlled growth once a continuous Cr$_2$O$_3$/$\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ scale formed. These observations help link kinetics, structure and chemistry, showing how an originally porous spinel layer transforms into a dense, adherent chromia + alumina scale that provides long-term protection in wrought Co/Ni-based superalloys.

Title: High-dimensional dynamical systems: co-existence of attractors, phase transitions, maximal Lyapunov exponent and response to periodic drive
Authors: Samantha J. Fournier, Pierfrancesco Urbani
Abstract: We study the dynamical properties of a broad class of high-dimensional random dynamical systems exhibiting chaotic as well as fixed point and periodic attractors. We consider cases in which attractors can co-exists in some regions of the phase diagrams and we characterize their nature by computing the maximal Lyapunov exponent. For a specific choice of the dynamical system we show that this quantity can be computed explicitly in the whole chaotic phase due to an underlying integrability of a properly defined Schrödinger problem. Furthermore, we consider the response of this dynamical systems to periodic perturbations. We show that these dynamical systems act as filters in the frequency-amplitude spectrum of the periodic forcing: only in some regions of the frequency-amplitude plane the periodic forcing leads to a synchronization of the dynamics. All in all, the results that we present mirror closely the ones observed in the past forty years in the study of standard models of random recurrent neural networks. However, the dynamical systems that we consider are easier to study and we believe that this may be an advantage if one wants to go beyond random dynamical systems and consider specific training strategies.

Title: Controlling Metastability through Annealing of High-Entropy Nanoalloy Electrocatalysts to Boost Performance towards the Oxygen Evolution Reaction
Authors: Varatharaja Nallathambi, Aneeta Jose Puthussery, Andrea M. Mingers, Robert Stuckert, André Olean-Oliveira, Sven Reichenberger, Dierk Raabe, Viktor Čolić, Baptiste Gault, Stephan Barcikowski
Abstract: Low-cost transition metal high-entropy nanoalloys are emerging as sustainable alternatives to platinum group electrocatalysts. Synthesis conditions of single-phase solid solutions can alter phase stability, causing surface composition changes that affect electrocatalytic performance. Here, we propose to exploit the metastability of carbon-doped Cantor alloy-based amorphous high-entropy alloy nanoparticles produced by nanosecond-pulsed laser synthesis in organic solvents. In situ electron microscopy reveals crystallization and partitioning of elements upon heating to 600 °C, forming heterostructured nanoparticles with reinforced carbon shells that exhibit a 5- to 7-fold enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity compared to the as-synthesized counterparts for the oxygen evolution reaction. We demonstrate the strategic utilization of phase metastability in high-entropy nanoalloys through post-synthesis annealing to enhance the electrochemical activity of laser-generated nanoparticles.

Title: Mediated interactions in mixtures of ultracold atoms
Authors: Henry Ando, Geyue Cai, Cheng Chin, Tilman Enss
Abstract: We describe recent theoretical and experimental developments on mediated interactions in mixtures of bosonic and fermionic atoms. We discuss how particle-hole excitations of a Fermi sea can induce long-range interactions between heavy impurities or atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Conversely, phonon excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate induce interactions between fermionic atoms. These mediated interactions exhibit different short-range and long-range scaling regimes with distance and, if strong enough, can induce fermion superfluidity. We discuss the prospects for observing new phenomena that could arise from mediated interactions. Experimentally, we outline recent studies of the 133Cs-6Li Bose-Fermi mixture, a platform well-suited for investigating fermion-mediated interactions. A Cs Bose-Einstein condensate immersed in a degenerate Li Fermi gas is prepared with tunable interspecies interactions. In the weak-coupling regime, precision measurements of condensate properties reveal fermion-mediated attractions between bosons, matching theoretical predictions. In the strong-coupling regime, we observe suppression and revival of sound modes and novel many-body resonances. Altogether, we aim to highlight both instances where experiment and theory agree well, and promising prospects to engineer long-range interactions in atomic quantum gases.

Title: Structure of Antiphase boundaries in Ni-M-Ga: multiscale modelling
Authors: Jan Zemen, František Máca, Václav Drchal, Martin Veis, Oleg Heczko
Abstract: Antiphase boundaries (APBs) are ubiquitous in ordered Heusler alloys and strongly influence magnetic coercivity in Ni-Mn-Ga, yet the link between their atomic-scale exchange interactions and micrometer-scale magnetic contrast measured by magnetic force microscopy (MFM) remains unclear. We combine density functional theory (DFT) and finite-element magnetostatics to bridge these scales in Ni-Mn-Ga. DFT calculations on supercells containing planar APBs show that the lowest-energy configuration comprises a pair of parallel APBs enclosing a nanoscale region - only three Mn-Ga atomic layers thick - whose magnetization is antiparallel to the surrounding matrix due to strong antiferromagnetic exchange across each APB (in contrast to ferromagnetic coupling in bulk martensite). According to our magnetostatic finite element model, this thin region with antiparallel magnetization generates the characteristic MFM contrast extending approx. 100 nm from the APB pair. When the APBs are further apart than 50 nm, dipole-dipole penalties outweigh exchange gains, preventing formation of an extended antiparallel domain, in agreement with experimental evidence. These results identify APB pairs as the origin of the observed MFM contrast and offer an interpretation of the modest strengths of domain-wall pinning by APBs, informing the design of magnetic shape-memory alloys with tailored coercivity.

Title: An optically enhanced crystalline silicon allotrope: hydrogen passivated type II silicon clathrate
Authors: Yinan Liu, Joseph P. Briggs, Sam Saiter, Meenakshi Singh, Carolyn A. Koh, P. Craig Taylor, Michael Walker, Khalid Mateen, Moussa Kane, Reuben T. Collins
Abstract: While Si clathrates have been explored as promising direct bandgap semiconductors, their practical optoelectronic performance has been limited by high doping levels and structural defects. Hydrogen has long been used to improve the optoelectronic quality of conventional Si, yet its role in clathrate structures remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that hydrogen (deuterium) can be incorporated into type II Si clathrate framework using remote plasma treatment. This process leads to the formation of NaD and SiD complexes, which significantly reduce both the Na donor density and dangling bond defects. Electron paramagnetic resonance confirms nearly a tenfold decrease in Na-related donor states, resulting in the lowest doping level reported in Si clathrates to date. Following passivation, the integrated photoluminescence intensity increases by a factor of 40, accompanied by a blue shift of the main emission peak, consistent with a transition closer to the intrinsic band edge. A new emission peak at 930 nm, attributed to hydrogen-related recombination centers, also appears. These improvements remain stable up to 400 oC. Altogether, this work establishes hydrogen passivation as a viable strategy for enhancing light emission in Si clathrates and opens a new pathway toward their application in Si-based light-emitting diodes and other direct-bandgap optoelectronic devices.

Title: A Brief Perspective on Piezotronic and Thermoelectric Coupling: Flexible Platforms for Synergistic Energy Scavenging and Peltier-Caloric Effects
Authors: David Carroll, ChaoChao Dun
Abstract: Advances in the development of flexible piezoelectric and thermoelectric materials have provided an important avenue for the exploration of energy scavenging through the thermodynamic-coupling of orthogonal energy-scavenging modalities. This has led to a body of work creating hybrid thermo/piezo-electric generator devices (T/PEGs) in which the two effects become thermodynamically entangled. Based on hetero- thin film architectures, such devices can exhibit a surprising power generation characteristic which is non-additive between the two energy-scavenging effects. For example, when the thermoelectric and piezoelectric effects are strongly coupled by their proximal fields, the efficacy of energy scavenging can be made to exceed that of the two effects independently. In this review of such effects, a basic coupled heat engine model is shown to provide insight into the origins of synergistic power generation. These models however, suggest the emergence of other combined thermodynamic properties such as the kinetic Peltier-Caloric Effect (PCE) traced to Onsager reciprocity. The recent observation of this effect in multicomponent systems is confirmation of the limited perspective of thermodynamic separability.

Title: Circling crystals in chiral active matter with self-alignment
Authors: Marco Musacchio, Alexander P. Antonov, Hartmut Löwen, Lorenzo Caprini
Abstract: We study a crystal composed of active units governed by self-alignment and chirality. The first mechanism acts as an effective torque that aligns the particle orientation with its velocity, while the second drives individual particles along circular orbits. We find that even a weak degree of chirality, when coupled with self-alignment, induces collective motion of the entire crystal along circular trajectories in space. We refer to this phase as a circling crystal. When chirality outweigh self-alignment, the circular global motion is suppressed in favor of vortex-like regions of coordinated motion. This state is characterized by oscillating spatial velocity correlations, a power law decay of the energy spectrum, and oscillatory temporal correlations. Our findings can be tested experimentally in systems ranging from epithelial tissues to swarming robots, governed by chirality and self-alignment.

Title: Impact of Contact Gating on Scaling of Monolayer 2D Transistors Using a Symmetric Dual-Gate Structure
Authors: Victoria M. Ravel, Sarah R. Evans, Samantha K. Holmes, James L. Doherty, Md Sazzadur Rahman, Tania Roy, Aaron D. Franklin
Abstract: The performance and scalability of two-dimensional (2D) field-effect transistors (FETs) are strongly influenced by geometry-defined electrostatics. In most 2D FET studies, the gate overlaps with the source and drain electrodes, allowing the gate potential to modulate the 2D semiconductor underneath the electrodes and ultimately effect carrier transport at the metal-semiconductor interface - a phenomenon known as contact gating. Here, a symmetric dual-gate structure with independently addressable back and top gates is employed to elucidate the impact of contact gating on a monolayer MoS2 channel. Unlike previous studies of contact gating, this symmetric structure enables quantification of the phenomena through a contact gating factor, revealing a 2x enhancement in on-state performance in long-channel devices. At scaled dimensions (50 nm channel and 30 nm contact length), the influence of contact gating becomes amplified, yielding a 5x increase in on-state performance and a 70% reduction in transfer length when contact gating is present. Since many reported record-performance 2D FETs employ back-gate geometries that inherently include contact gating, these results establish contact gating as a critical and previously underappreciated determinant of device performance in the 2D FET landscape.

Title: Cryogenic UV detection using stress-engineered zero-bias ZnO-thin film based Piezo-Photonic detector
Authors: P. Sau, N. Hancock, I. Tzoka, V. Khichar, A. Barajas, G. Gansle, N. Hozhabri, V.A. Chirayath, J. Asaadi
Abstract: We demonstrate a zero-bias ultraviolet (UV) detector using zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films as the active semiconductor layer, specifically for application in cryogenic conditions. The zero-bias device utilizes the piezoelectric potential developed through interfacial stress in the active semiconductor layer for charge transport. We explored two vertically stacked metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) configurations: Sample I, a device comprised of chromium (Cr)/ZnO/Cr layers, and Sample II, a ZnO-silicon nitride (Si3N4) device comprised of Cr/Si3N4/ZnO/Cr layers. The Si3N4 layer in Sample II was introduced in the form of pillars, with the aim of increasing the residual stress in the active region. These fabricated devices were tested at both room and cryogenic temperatures to characterize their UV-detection performance in a custom test stand using a 365 nm UV LED source. We observe a higher UV-induced voltage signal for Sample II in comparison to Sample I at both temperature regimes. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements showed approximately 40% higher residual stress in Sample II than in Sample I. A higher residual stress suggests a higher induced piezopotential in Sample II, explaining the enhancement in the UV-induced signal. Our results demonstrate that through appropriate in-device stress engineering, UV photoinduced signals can be enhanced, increasing detector sensitivity. A zero-bias photodetector with in-device stress engineering, as demonstrated here, can have applications in extreme environments, like cryogenic liquid noble elements or high radiation space environments, where low or zero-power detection may be required.

Title: Control of Extraordinary Optical Transmission in Resonant Terahertz Gratings via Lateral Depletion in an AlGaN-GaN Heterostructure
Authors: Geofrey Nyabere, Hunter Ellis, Miguel Gomez, Wei Jia, Yizheng Liu, Karli Ann Higley, Sriram Krishnamoorthy, Steve Blair, Kai Fu, Berardi Sensale-Rodriguez
Abstract: Periodic metallic gratings on substrates can support a range of electromagnetic modes, such as leaky waveguide, guided-resonant, and Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity modes, which can strongly modulate optical transmission under resonant excitation. Here, we investigate how this coupling can be dynamically manipulated through charge-density control in a laterally patterned AlGaN/GaN heterostructure. The structure comprises metallic stripes separated by regions containing a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), forming a periodically modulated interface whose electromagnetic response is governed by the charge density between the stripes. In the unbiased state, the conductive 2DEG screens the incident terahertz field and suppresses excitation of guided modes. When the 2DEG is depleted, the change in boundary conditions allows efficient coupling into substrate resonances, producing a strong modulation at particular frequencies where extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) through the structure takes place. The results highlight the sensitive dependence of guided-mode-resonance (GMR) mediated EOT on inter-stripe charge distribution and demonstrate a direct interplay between carrier dynamics and resonant electromagnetic phenomena in the terahertz regime.

Title: Multibit Ferroelectric Memcapacitor for Non-volatile Analogue Memory and Reconfigurable Filtering
Authors: Deepika Yadav, Spyros Stathopoulos, Patrick Foster, Andreas Tsiamis, Mohamed Awadein, Hannah Levene, Themis Prodromakis (University of Edinburgh)
Abstract: Tuneable capacitors are vital for adaptive and reconfigurable electronics, yet existing approaches require continuous bias or mechanical actuation. Here we demonstrate a voltage-programmable ferroelectric memcapacitor based on HfZrO that achieves more than eight stable, reprogrammable capacitance states (3-bit encoding) within a non-volatile window of 24~pF. The device switches at low voltages (3~V), with each state exhibiting long retention (10^5~s) and high endurance (10^6 cycles), ensuring reliable multi-level operation. At the nanoscale, multistate charge retention was directly visualised using atomic force microscopy, confirming the robustness of individual states beyond macroscopic measurements. As a proof of concept, the capacitor was integrated into a high-pass filter, where the programmed capacitive states shift the cutoff frequency over 5~kHz, establishing circuit-level viability. This work demonstrates the feasibility of CMOS-compatible, non-volatile, analogue memory based on ferroelectric HfZrO, paving the way for adaptive RF filters, reconfigurable analogue front-ends, and neuromorphic electronics.

Title: Interaction-induced Dimension Reduction for Bound States in Microwave-Shielded Ultracold Molecules
Authors: Haitian Wang, Tingting Shi, Xiaoling Cui
Abstract: We investigate tetratomic and hexatomic bound states of ultracold molecules dressed by an elliptic microwave field. We show that these bound states can be accurately described by effective one-dimensional (1D) models incorporating high-order angular fluctuations, despite the physical system is in three-dimensional (3D) free space. By comparing with exact solutions of the full 3D system, we identify the validity region of such 1D description in the parameter plane of ellipticity and coupling strength of microwave field. The hard-core character of these effective models enables a duality between bosonic and fermionic molecules in real and spectral space, while their momentum distributions remain distinct. Our results have demonstrated an effective dimension reduction in microwave-shielded molecular systems, which is purely due to the intrinsic interaction anisotropy rather than any external confinement. Extending to large systems, our results suggest a self-bound single-molecule array as the ground state of both bosonic and fermionic molecular gases.

Title: Learning of Statistical Field Theories
Authors: Shreya Shukla, Abhijith Jayakumar, Andrey Y. Lokhov
Abstract: Recovering microscopic couplings directly from data provides a route to solving the inverse problem in statistical field theories, one that complements the traditional-often computationally intractable-forward approach of predicting observables from an action or Hamiltonian. Here, we propose an approach for the inverse problem that uniformly accommodates systems with discrete, continuous, and hybrid variables. We demonstrate accurate parameter recovery in several benchmark systems-including Wegner's Ising gauge theory, $\phi^4$ theory, Schwinger and Sine-Gordon models, and mixed spin-gauge systems, and show how iterating the procedure under coarse-graining reconstructs full non-perturbative renormalization-group flows. This gives direct access to phase boundaries, fixed points, and emergent interactions without relying on perturbation theory. We also address a realistic setting where full gauge configurations may be unavailable, and reformulate learning algorithms for multiple field theories so that they are recovered directly using observables such as correlations from scattering data or quantum simulators. We anticipate that our methodology will find widespread use in practical learning of field theories in strongly coupled regimes where analytical tools might fail.

Title: Quantum fluctuations associated with first-order magnetic transition in a frustrated kagome lattice antiferromagnet
Authors: Zhongchen Xu, Xinyang Liu, Cuiwei Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Feng Jin, Junsen Xiang, Quansheng Wu, Xianmin Zhang, Peijie Sun, Youguo Shi
Abstract: Intense quantum fluctuations arising from geometrical frustrations in kagome-lattice magnets provide a feasible approach to exotic quantum states. Here, we document an unexpected isosymmetric first-order magnetic transition in the recently synthesized frustrated kagome-lattice antiferromagnet Nd3ScBi5, which is characterized by significant latent heat and a pronounced magnetocaloric effect, as well as discontinuous Raman shifts and negligible hysteresis. Employing the magnetocaloric effect as a detection method, in conjunction with systematical field-dependent physical properties, we uncover a distinctive 1/2 magnetization plateau phase with significant quantum fluctuations. Our study unveils Nd3ScBi5 as a prototypical model with an emerging phase of enhanced quantum fluctuations triggered by first-order magnetic transitions.

Title: Potential-Programmed Operando Ensembles Govern Nitrate Electroreduction
Authors: Xue-Chun Jiang, Jia-Lan Chen, Wei-Xue Li, Jin-Xun Liu
Abstract: Electrocatalyst surfaces continuously reorganize on the timescale of catalytic turnover, obscuring the identification of active sites under operando conditions and hindering rational catalyst design. Here, we resolve the operando Cu(111) electrolyte interface for nitrate-to-ammonia electroreduction (NO3RR) via a multiscale modeling framework accelerated by a coverage-aware machine-learning potential. Rather than a single "average coverage" site, the working interface is a potential-gated statistical ensemble of 34 interconverting adsorbate motifs between -0.10 and -1.00 V (vs. SHE). Potential-driven shifts in motif populations produce a volcano-shaped activity trend peaking at -0.70 V, where the site-normalized turnover frequency reaches 0.015 s-1 with nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency to ammonia. The activation barriers across >150 transition states collapse into a single linear relationship with the excess charge on the reacting Cu atoms ({\Delta}qCu), identifying interfacial charge redistribution as a unifying kinetic descriptor. The maximum activity arises not from uniform moderate coverage but from a 2NO/2NH2 quadrilateral microensemble that tunes {\Delta}qCu to an intermediate value, simultaneously lowering the N-O cleavage and N-H formation barriers. Reconceptualizing "coverage" as an ensemble of local microenvironments decouples thermodynamic stability from catalytic productivity. This perspective furnishes a parameter-free strategy by controlling motif populations and interfacial charge via the potential to program high-coverage electrocatalysis beyond the NO3RR.

Title: Observation of Shapiro Steps in the Charge Density Wave State Induced by Strain on a Piezoelectric Substrate
Authors: Koji Fujiwara, Takuya Kawada, Natsumi Nikaido, Jihoon Park, Nan Jiang, Shintaro Takada, Yasuhiro Niimi
Abstract: Recent development in nanotechnology has enabled us to investigate the dynamic properties of van der Waals materials on a piezoelectric substrate. Here we report on the dynamics of charge density wave (CDW) in NbSe$_{3}$ nanowires induced by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). Clear peaks in the differential resistance were observed at the resonant frequency of the SAW device. These peaks known as Shapiro steps are typically observed by applying an rf current to NbSe$_{3}$ nanowires. We found that the Shapiro steps induced by SAWs show several distinct features from the ones induced by an rf current. Our detailed study revealed that a strain induced by SAWs plays a significant role in the Shapiro steps. The result clearly demonstrates the importance of the strain in CDW materials and paves the way for strain-induced device applications.

Title: Enhanced Thermoelectricity in Nanowires with inhomogeneous Helical states
Authors: Zahra Aslani, Fabio Taddei, Fabrizio Dolcini, Alessandro Braggio
Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), when exposed to a suitably applied Zeeman field, exhibit one-dimensional helical channels with a spin orientation locked to the propagation direction within the magnetic energy gap. Here, by adopting a scattering-matrix approach applied to a tight-binding model of the NW, we demonstrate that the thermoelectric (TE) properties can be widely controlled by tuning the misalignment angle $\phi$ between the spin-orbit directions of two NW segments. In particular, when the RSOC vectors are antiparallel (Dirac paradox configuration) we predict a significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, and a strong enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and the $ZT$ figure of merit. We also show that the Zeeman gap determines the optimal energy window for doping and temperatures. These results suggest that controlling the spin-orbit field direction, which can be achieved with suitably applied wrap gates, is a promising alternative for tuning and optimizing the TE response in quantum-coherent semiconducting NW devices.

Title: Beyond empirical models: Discovering new constitutive laws in solids with graph-based equation discovery
Authors: Hao Xu, Yuntian Chen, Dongxiao Zhang
Abstract: Constitutive models are fundamental to solid mechanics and materials science, underpinning the quantitative description and prediction of material responses under diverse loading conditions. Traditional phenomenological models, which are derived through empirical fitting, often lack generalizability and rely heavily on expert intuition and predefined functional forms. In this work, we propose a graph-based equation discovery framework for the automated discovery of constitutive laws directly from multisource experimental data. This framework expresses equations as directed graphs, where nodes represent operators and variables, edges denote computational relations, and edge features encode parametric dependencies. This enables the generation and optimization of free-form symbolic expressions with undetermined material-specific parameters. Through the proposed framework, we have discovered new constitutive models for strain-rate effects in alloy steel materials and the deformation behavior of lithium metal. Compared with conventional empirical models, these new models exhibit compact analytical structures and achieve higher accuracy. The proposed graph-based equation discovery framework provides a generalizable and interpretable approach for data-driven scientific modelling, particularly in contexts where traditional empirical formulations are inadequate for representing complex physical phenomena.

Title: Re-refinement of the structure of the planar hexagonal phase of ZnO nanocrystals
Authors: Musen Li, Lingyao Zhang, Wei Ren, Jeffrey R. Reimers
Abstract: The planar hexagonal phase of ZnO, known as h-ZnO, g-ZnO, alpha-ZnO, the Bk structure, the 5-5 phase, the alpha-BN phase, etc., has P63/mmc symmetry and is implicated in ferroelectric switching mechanisms for wurtzite-ZnO. It is well-known in thin films on substrates, to be pressure stabilized, etc., but critical is its possible existence in high-purity nanocrystals under ambient conditions. Indeed, a crystal structure has been reported, but this work remains controversial as first-principles calculations predict very different structural properties. Herein, the original experimental data is re-refined, using more sophisticated techniques, to yield lattice parameters of a = 3.45+/-0.02 Å and c = 4.46+/-0.02 Å that are 0.35 Å and 0.80 Å, respectively, larger than those previously reported and in good agreement with computational predictions. This confirms that ZnO can form a metastable planar hexagonal phase. It provides key information pertaining to polarization switching in ZnO, its derivatives, and general wurtzite-structured materials.

Title: Chiral orbital/spin textures and Edelstein effects in monolayer Janus TMDs
Authors: Pratik Sahu, Sashi Satpathy, Birabar Ranjit Kumar Nanda
Abstract: We investigate the orbital and spin Edelstein effect(OEE and SEE) in two-dimensional Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) of the form MXX$^\prime$ $(M = Mo,\ W,\ Nb;\ X/X^\prime = S,\ Se,\ Te)$ with the aid of density functional theory calculations and tight-binding model Hamiltonian studies. The chalcogen layers $X$ and $X^\prime$, break the mirror symmetry to introduce an internal electric field $E_{int}$ normal to the plane, which is responsible for OEE and SEE. Our results show that in a non-Janus framework, the wavefunctions at the valence and conduction bands are dominated with the $|x^2-y^2>$, $|xy>$, and $|z^2>$ orbitals. Due to the $E_{int}$ of the Janus system, these orbitals are now intermixed with the $|xz>$ and $|yz>$ orbitals to produce a robust orbital texture around the valleys $\Gamma,K$ and $K^\prime$. The spin orbit coupling, in addition to the formation of a spin texture, introduces a chirality reversal to the orbital texture. An applied in plane electric field creates both OEE and SEE with the former being one order higher in magnitude. This makes the Janus materials promising for spin-orbitronics. Our work paves the way for further experimental exploration for orbital and spin orbital torque in Janus TMDs.

Title: Electric Field-Induced Phase Transitions and Hysteresis in Ferroelectric HfO2 Captured with Machine Learning Potential
Authors: Po-Yen Chen, Teruyasu Mizoguchi
Abstract: Electric field-induced studies, including phase transition and polarization hysteresis, for ferroelectric HfO2 at the atomic scale are critical since they can largely affect its application in ferroelectric and dielectric devices. However, conventional first-principles approaches are computationally limited in capturing large-scale atomic dynamics under realistic field conditions. Here, to enable electric-field-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we develop a machine learning potential (MLP) tailored for HfO2, coupled with an in-situ Born effective charge (BEC) model. This framework enables us to capture key phenomena, including field-induced phase transitions, polarization switching, and strain-dependent dielectric responses, with high fidelity and computational efficiency. Notably, we reproduce hysteresis loops and phase transition barriers consistent with AIMD results and reveal possible electric-field-induced polarization activation in the monoclinic phase. Our approach offers a scalable and transferable tool for atomistic exploration of functional oxides and paves the way for data-driven design of ferroelectric devices.

Title: Competition between Weak Localization and Antilocalization of Dirac-like Fermions in a Spin-Polarized Two-Dimensional Electron Gas at KTaO3 (111) Interface
Authors: Hui Zhang, Daming Tian, Xiaobing Chen, Lu Chen, Min Li, Yetong Bai, Fengxia Hu, Baogen Shen, Jirong Sun, Weisheng Zhao
Abstract: Quantum transport phenomena in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at oxide interfaces have garnered significant interest owing to their potential in spintronic and quantum information technologies. Here, we systematically investigate the quantum conductance corrections of spin-polarized 2DEGs formed at the interfaces between two insulating oxides, ferromagnetic EuTiO3 (ETO) films and (111)-oriented KTaO3 (KTO) substrates. The anomalous Hall effect and hysteretic magnetoresistance provide clear evidence for long-range ferromagnetic order in the 2DEGs, which could be attributed to interfacial Eu doping in combination with the magnetic proximity effect of the ETO layer. The breaking of time-reversal symmetry by ferromagnetism in the 2DEGs, and with the assistance of spin-orbit coupling effect, gives rise to a nontrivial Berry phase. This results in a competition between weak localization (WL) and weak antilocalization (WAL) in the quantum transport of Dirac-like fermions at the KTO (111) interfaces. Notably, this competitive behavior can be effectively tuned by optical gating via a photoexcitation-induced shift of the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate a controllable platform based on spin-polarized oxide 2DEGs for quantum transport, opening new avenues for spin-orbitronic and topological electronic applications.

Title: Numerical Modeling of Cu2MnSnS4/FeSi2 Dual-Absorber Solar Cell Achieving High Efficiency
Authors: Hasib Md Abid Bin Farid, Md Tashfiq Bin Kashem
Abstract: Dual-absorber solar cells represent a promising approach to surpass the efficiency limit of single-junction devices by extending spectral absorption and minimizing thermalization losses. Among earth-abundant thin-film materials, kesterites have attracted considerable interest, however, the well-studied Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) continues to face challenges related to antisite disorder and secondary phase formation. Replacing Zn with Mn in Cu2MnSnS4 (CMTS) mitigates these limitations, improving cation ordering and electronic quality while maintaining favorable optical properties. Yet, despite its potential, CMTS remains largely unexplored in multi-absorber configurations-only one prior study has reported a CMTS-based dual-absorber device. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical investigation of a CMTS-FeSi2 dual-absorber thin-film solar cell using the one-dimensional solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D). FeSi2, with its narrow band gap (0.87 eV) and strong near-infrared absorption, serves as an ideal bottom absorber to complement CMTS, enabling broader spectral utilization. The study systematically examines the effects of geometrical, electronic, and interfacial parameters on carrier transport, and overall device performance. The optimized device delivers an impressive power conversion efficiency of 34.9%, with VOC = 0.79 V, JSC = 51.07 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 85.91%. These findings demonstrate that integrating FeSi2 with CMTS not only enhances carrier collection and spectral harvesting but also establishes a new pathway toward high-efficiency, sustainable, and environmentally benign thin-film photovoltaics.

Title: Giant tunneling magnetoresistance based on spin-valley-mismatched ferromagnetic metals
Authors: Kan Yan, Li Cheng, Yizhi Hu, Junjie Gao, Xiaolong Zou, Xiaobin Chen
Abstract: Half metals, which are amenable to perfect spin filtering, can be utilized for high-magnetoresistive devices. However, available half metals are very limited. Here, we demonstrate that materials with intrinsic spin-valley-mismatched (SVM) states can be used to block charge transport, resembling half metals and leading to giant tunneling magnetoresistance. As an example, by using first-principles transport calculations, we show that ferromagnetic 1\emph{T}-VSe$_2$, 1\emph{T}-VS$_2$, and 2\emph{H}-VS$_2$ are such spin-valley-mismatched metals, and giant magnetoresistance of more than 99\% can be realized in spin-valve van der Waals (vdW) junctions using these metals as electrodes. Owing to the intrinsic mismatch of spin states, the central-layer materials for the vdW junctions can be arbitrary nonmagnetic materials, in principle. Our research provides clear physical insights into the mechanism for high magnetoresistance and opens new avenues for the search and design of high-magnetoresistance devices.

Abstract: Re-using the substrate is identified as a method for reducing the cost of high efficiency III-V solar cells. The approach investigated here consists in inserting a graphene layer onto a (001)GaAs substrate prior to the epitaxial growth of GaAs. To obtain a monocrystalline GaAs grown layer, the graphene layer is patterned, followed by a two-step epitaxial growth, here performed by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The first step is a selective area growth of GaAs in graphene openings, followed by a lateral overgrowth, under a modulated Ga flux. The second step, after reaching coalescence, consists in a regular growth under continuous Ga supply. It is observed that the pattern orientations relative to the crystallographic direction of the GaAs substrate below the graphene have an influence on GaAs morphology and quality. The best result was obtained for patterns oriented along [1__10]+22.5{\textdegree} with a graphene coverage of 50%, with a significantly reduced roughness down to 3.3 nm.

Title: pynxtools: A Python framework for generating and validating NeXus files in experimental data workflows
Authors: Sherjeel Shabih, Lukas Pielsticker, Florian Dobener, Andrea Albino, Theodore Chang, Carola Emminger, Lev Ginzburg, Ron Hildebrandt, Markus Kühbach, Rubel Mozumder, Tommaso Pincelli, Martin Aeschlimann, Marius Grundman, Walid Hetaba, Carlos-Andres Palma, Laurenz Rettig, Markus Scheidgen, José Antonio Márquez Prieto, Claudia Draxl, Sandor Brockhauser, Christoph Koch, Heiko B. Weber
Abstract: Scientific data across physics, materials science, and materials engineering often lacks adherence to FAIR principles (Barker et al., 2022; Jacobsen et al., 2020; M. D. Wilkinson et al., 2016; S. R. Wilkinson et al., 2025) due to incompatible instrument-specific formats and diverse standardization practices. pynxtools is a Python software development framework with a command line interface (CLI) that standardizes data conversion for scientific experiments in materials science to the NeXus format (Klosowski et al., 1997; Könnecke, 2006; Könnecke et al., 2015) across diverse scientific domains. NeXus defines data storage specifications for different experimental techniques through application definitions. pynxtools provides a fixed, versioned set of NeXus application definitions that ensures convergence and alignment in data specifications across, among others, atom probe tomography, electron microscopy, optical spectroscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Through its modular plugin architecture pynxtools provides conversion of data and metadata from instruments and electronic lab notebooks to these unified definitions, while performing validation to ensure data correctness and NeXus compliance. pynxtools can be integrated directly into Research Data Management Systems (RDMS) to facilitate parsing and normalization. We detail one example for the RDM system NOMAD. By simplifying the adoption of NeXus, the framework enables true data interoperability and FAIR data management across multiple experimental techniques.

Title: MATAI: A Generalist Machine Learning Framework for Property Prediction and Inverse Design of Advanced Alloys
Authors: Yanchen Deng, Chendong Zhao, Yixuan Li, Bijun Tang, Xinrun Wang, Zhonghan Zhang, Yuhao Lu, Penghui Yang, Jianguo Huang, Yushan Xiao, Cuntai Guan, Zheng Liu, Bo An
Abstract: The discovery of advanced metallic alloys is hindered by vast composition spaces, competing property objectives, and real-world constraints on manufacturability. Here we introduce MATAI, a generalist machine learning framework for property prediction and inverse design of as-cast alloys. MATAI integrates a curated alloy database, deep neural network-based property predictors, a constraint-aware optimization engine, and an iterative AI-experiment feedback loop. The framework estimates key mechanical propertie, sincluding density, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation, directly from composition, using multi-task learning and physics-informed inductive biases. Alloy design is framed as a constrained optimization problem and solved using a bi-level approach that combines local search with symbolic constraint programming. We demonstrate MATAI's capabilities on the Ti-based alloy system, a canonical class of lightweight structural materials, where it rapidly identifies candidates that simultaneously achieve lower density (<4.45 g/cm3), higher strength (>1000 MPa) and appreciable ductility (>5%) through only seven iterations. Experimental validation confirms that MATAI-designed alloys outperform commercial references such as TC4, highlighting the framework's potential to accelerate the discovery of lightweight, high-performance materials under real-world design constraints.

Title: Generalized Gross-Pitaevskii Equation for 2D Bosons with Attractive Interactions
Authors: Michał Suchorowski, Fabian Brauneis, Hans-Werner Hammer, Michał Tomza, Artem G. Volosniev
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation for two-dimensional (2D) attractive Bose systems. First, we demonstrate that it accurately captures key properties of universal bound states in free space commonly referred to as quantum droplets. We then apply the framework to predict the existence of universal excited states, including vortex configurations, which may be more accessible to experimental investigation than the ground state. Additionally, we investigate breathing modes and quench dynamics in trapped geometries. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for exploring both static and dynamical phenomena in finite 2D Bose systems, offering guidance for the design of future experimental protocols.

Title: Emergent electronic insulating states in a one-dimensional moiré superlattice

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) moiré superlattices have provided a powerful knob to engineer a plethora of new quantum states. However, extending such moiré engineering to one-dimensional (1D) vdW systems has remained challenging. Here we report the moiré-engineered electronic insulating states in a new 1D moiré superlattice, by crystallographically aligning an armchair single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) to 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. Remarkably, we observe the emergence of pronounced insulating states at charge neutrality point (CNP), full and half moiré fillings in lattice-aligned armchair SWNT/hBN heterostructures by low-temperature electrical transport measurements. In strong contrast, armchair SWNT devices without hBN alignment do not show any of these insulating behaviors, providing compelling evidence for the significant 1D moiré effect. Our density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding calculations reveal that synergetic nanotube partial flattening and in-plane lattice reconstruction at 1D moiré interface expand the most stable AB' stacking regions (carbon on top of boron) and open sizable band gaps at both CNP and full moiré fillings at the single-particle level. Our one-body theory predicts no band gaps at half moiré fillings, suggesting that electron correlation and/or electron-phonon interaction may give rise to these emergent insulating behaviors in our 1D moiré systems. Our work establishes a new and definite moiré engineering route for 1D vdW materials and opens an exciting avenue for exploring interaction-induced quantum phases in 1D.

Title: Competing Localizations on Disordered Non-Hermitian Random Graph Lattice
Authors: S Rahul, A Harshitha
Abstract: Phase transitions in one-dimensional lattice systems are well established and have been extensively studied within both Hermitian and non-Hermitian frameworks. In this work, we extend this understanding to a more general setting by investigating localization and delocalization transitions and the behavior of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) using a tight binding model on a generalized random graph lattice. Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $\Delta$, on site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that render the underlying nature of random graph. By varying $p,$ $\Delta$ and the disorder, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties. Our results show the competition between skin effect driven and Anderson driven localizations in the parameter regimes. Despite the presence of large disorder, the skin effect driven localization coexists with Anderson driven localization.

Title: Magnetic Frustration Enforced Electronic Reconstruction in Ni intercalated NbSe$_{2}$: Suppression of Electronic Orders
Authors: Ashutosh S. Wadge, Alexander Kazakov, Xujia Gong, Daniel Jastrzebski, Bogdan J. Kowalski, Artem Lynnyk, Lukasz Plucinski, Amar Fakhredine, Ryszard Diduszko, Marta Aleszkiewicz, Jedrzej Korczak, Dawid Wutke, Marcin Rosmus, Rafal Kurleto, Natalia Olszowska, Carmine Autieri, Andrzej Wisniewski
Abstract: We investigate the single crystals of Ni$_{0.19}$NbSe$_2$, revealing that Ni intercalation profoundly alters the physical properties of NbSe$_2$. Magnetic measurements clearly show that the system is magnetically frustrated with antiferromagnetic ordering below 23.5\,K, with an irreversibility temperature near 10\,K, and a magnetic hysteresis with a small net magnetic moment. Overall, the system can be described as an inhomogeneous antiferromagnetic phase with magnetic disorder and magnetic frustration. We found two Curie-Weiss temperatures of -80\,K for the field in the {\it ab}-plane and -137\,K for the field out of plane, which are a consequence of anisotropic interactions in spin space and favor an orientation of the spin along the {\it c}-axis. Temperature-dependent resistivity shows a complete suppression of both charge density waves and superconducting order down to 300\,mK. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy at 84\,K reveals a $\overline{\Gamma}$-centered electron pocket in Ni$_{0.19}$NbSe$_2$, which is absent in pristine NbSe$_2$. The electronic structure results show a shift of the van Hove singularity (VHS), which is the main cause of the suppression of the electronic orders. These results align with recent theoretical predictions that Ni intercalation with cationic disorder favors frustrated antiferromagnetic stripe states, shifts the VHS and reconstructs the Fermi surface in NbSe$_2$. Our findings position Ni$_{0.19}$NbSe$_2$ within a magnetically frustrated, non-superconducting regime, highlighting how partial intercalation and disorder drive complex magnetic order and the Fermi surface reconstruction in low-dimensional quantum materials.

Title: Measurement protocol for detecting correlated topological insulators in synthetic quantum systems
Authors: Yixin Ma, Chao Xu, Shenghan Jiang
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators, characterized by symmetry-protected anomalous boundary modes, have been generalized to the strongly correlated regime for both bosonic and fermionic systems. As correlated topological insulators (TI) approach experimental realization in quantum simulators, conventional probes, such as transport measurements, are not easily applicable to these synthetic platforms. In this study, we focus on two examples of correlated TI: a bosonic TI protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2\times U(1)$ symmetry and the fermionic quantum spin Hall insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry. We propose a unified, readily implementable protocol based on measuring the disorder parameter $\langle\exp(\mathrm{i}\theta \hat{Q}_A)\rangle$ for a large subregion $A$, with $\hat{Q}_A$ the total charge operator within $A$. Our key finding is that this quantity exhibits non-analytical dependence on $\theta$ for correlated TI, a signature robust against decoherence. We establish this diagnostic through both numerical simulations and analytical derivations. This protocol is well-suited for implementation on near-term quantum simulation platforms, providing a direct route to experimentally confirm correlated TI.

Title: Wavelength-commensurate anatase TiO\_2 particles for ro-bust and functional Mie resonances across the visible and near infrared
Authors: Pedro Tartaj, Yurena Luengo, Pedro Moronta, Luisina Forzani, Alvaro Blanco, Cefe López
Abstract: Earth-abundant materials exhibiting Mie resonances across the visible and near-infrared offer opportunities for efficient and sustainable sensing, thermal regulation, and sunlight harvesting. For anatase TiO$_2$, a broadband optical and abundant material, Mie calculations indicate that robust resonances require size tunability and monodispersity (standard deviation, $\lesssim$ 5\%) over an extended range (0.5-2 $\mu$m) not yet experimentally covered, while maintaining a refractive index above 2 to ensure optical contrast, for example with biomolecules. Here, we demonstrate that a simple UV-assisted thermal hydrolysis route yields anatase particles that meet all these criteria and remain aqueous-processable. Consequently, the materials display intense and modulable Mie resonances across the visible/near-infrared regions (including biological windows), outperforming previous results that were limited by size. Strong optical resonances combined with ambient-temperature processability enable robust, broadband, label-free detection of transparent biomolecules. Our insights advance precise synthesis and Mie-based photonics of an earth-abundant material, and indicate the potential for cost-effective and rapid-on-demand integration via printing technologies, further enhanced by anatase's biocompatibility and photochemical properties.

Title: Scalable data-driven modeling of microstructure evolution by learning local dependency and spatiotemporal translation invariance rules in phase field simulation
Authors: Zishuo Lan, Qionghuan Zeng, Weilong Ma, Xiangju Liang, Yue Li, Yu Chen, Yiming Chen, Xiaobing Hu, Junjie Li, Lei Wang, Jing Zhang, Zhijun Wang, Jincheng Wang
Abstract: Phase-field (PF) simulation provides a powerful framework for predicting microstructural evolution but suffers from prohibitive computational costs that severely limit accessible spatiotemporal scales in practical applications. While data-driven methods have emerged as promising approaches for accelerating PF simulations, existing methods require extensive training data from numerous evolution trajectories, and their inherent black-box nature raises concerns about long-term prediction reliability. This work demonstrates, through examples of grain growth and spinodal decomposition, that a minimalist Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with a remarkably small dataset even from a single small-scale simulation can achieve seamless scalability to larger systems and reliable long-term predictions far beyond the temporal range of the training data. The key insight of this work lies in revealing that the success of CNN-based models stems from the alignment between their inductive biases and the physical priors of phase-field simulations specifically, locality and spatiotemporal translation invariance. Through effective receptive field analysis, we verify that the model captures these essential properties during training. Therefore, from a reductionist perspective, the surrogate model essentially establishes a spatiotemporally invariant regression mapping between a grid point's local environment and its subsequent state. Further analysis of the model's feature space demonstrates that microstructural evolution effectively represents a continuous redistribution of a finite set of local environments. When the model has already encountered nearly all possible local environments in the early-stage training data, it can reliably generalize to much longer evolution timescales, regardless of the dramatic changes in global microstructural morphology.

Title: Magnetotransport properties of an unconventional Rashba spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional electronic system
Authors: Aryan Pandita, SK Firoz Islam
Abstract: We study the magnetotransport properties of a two-dimensional electronic system with unconventional Rashba spin-orbit coupling in which the system is described by a pair of chiral spin texture in each spin branch, and the chirality is opposite in two spin branches. We obtain the Landau levels analytically and find that intra-spin and/or inter-spin Landau level crossing occurs. We compute the longitudinal conductivity and quantum Hall conductivity using the Kubo formalism based on linear response theory. We find that the usual Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation in longitudinal conductivity appears that can be made purely spin polarized by adjusting the Fermi level suitably. We observe a beating pattern in the Shubnikov-de Hass oscillation in the intra-spin branches, which arises due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to two bands in each spin branch. This is contrary to the conventional Rashba system, where such beating is due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to the two spin-branches. On the other hand, we note that quantum-Hall conductivity exhibits usual quantization in units of $e^2/h$ corresponding to each spin dependent Landau level. However, the Landau level crossing gives rise to the double jump in the Hall conductivity if the Fermi level is placed precisely at the crossing point.

Title: Dual-Mode Luminescent Thermometry in LiYO2:Nd3+,Yb3+ Enabled by Structural Phase Transition and Phonon-Assisted Energy Transfer
Authors: M. Tahir Abbas, M. Szymczak, D. Szymanski, M. Drozd, G. Chen, L. Marciniak
Abstract: In this work, a dual-mode luminescent thermometer operating via both ratiometric and lifetime-based readout strategies was developed, enabled by the coexistence of two thermally driven effects: a structural phase transition in LiYO2 and a phonon-assisted energy transfer from Yb3+ to Nd3+. As demonstrated, changes in the shape of the emission band of Yb3+ ions corresponding to the 2F5/2 -> 2F7/2 electronic transition, induced by the phase transition, enabled the design of a ratiometric thermometer with a maximum relative sensitivity (SR) of 3.1% K^-1 for LiYO2 doped with 10% Yb3+ and 1% Nd3+ at 290 K. In contrast, the temperature-dependent Yb3+ -> Nd3+ energy transfer facilitated the development of a lifetime-based thermometer with a maximum SR of 1.5% K^-1 for 20% Nd3+ at 378 K. In both approaches, tuning the Nd3+ concentration allowed modulation of both the sensitivity and the temperature at which the maximum SR occurred. This was achieved by shifting the phase transition temperature and increasing the probability of interionic energy transfer, respectively. Notably, the temperature ranges corresponding to the maximum SR for the ratiometric and lifetime modes were distinct, effectively broadening the thermal operating window of the sensor. Additionally, it was shown that LiYO2 doped with Nd3+ and Yb3+ can also be used as a temperature sensor through the ratio of luminescence intensities recorded at two different time gates. Furthermore, the results confirmed that the phonon-assisted energy transfer process plays the dominant role in shaping the luminescence kinetics, surpassing the influence of the structural phase transition. Overall, this study identifies LiYO2:Nd3+,Yb3+ as a promising candidate for multimodal luminescent temperature sensing applications.

Title: Exact fluctuation relation for open systems beyond the Jarzynski equality
Authors: Mohammad Rahbar, Christopher J. Stein
Abstract: We derive exact fluctuation equalities for open systems that recover free energy differences between two equilibrium endpoints connected by nonequilibrium processes with arbitrary dynamics and coupling. The exponential of the free energy difference is expressed in terms of ensemble averages of the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) shift and the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final marginal probability distribution of the open system. A trajectory counterpart of this relation follows from an asymptotic equilibration postulate, which treats relaxation to the final stationary canonical state as a boundary condition rather than as a consequence of constraints on the driven dynamics. In the frozen-coupling regime, the HMF shift reduces to the bare-system Hamiltonian shift, yielding a clear heat-work decomposition. The Jarzynski equality (JE) is recovered under the assumption of Hamiltonian dynamics for the combined system. We validate the theory on a dissipative, phase-space-compressing drive followed by an underdamped Langevin relaxation, where the assumptions underlying the JE break down, whereas our equality reproduces the exact free energy differences.

Title: Direct Raman observation of the quantum metric in a quantum magnet
Authors: Chao-Fan Wang, Han Ge, Jun-Yang Chen, Liusuo Wu, Xiaobin Chen, Jia-Wei Mei, Mingyuan Huang
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) unifies the Berry curvature (its imaginary part) and the quantum metric (its real part), yet Raman studies of chiral phonons have so far accessed only the former. We perform circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy on the quantum magnet K2Co(SeO3)2, where the field-odd chiral splitting and the field-even center-frequency shift collapse onto a single curve across temperature and magnetic field, revealing a common microscopic origin for both observables. Since the chiral splitting reflects the Berry curvature, the concomitant even component, arising from the same microscopic origin, captures the field-induced change of the quantum metric, corresponding to the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction. Across two resolvable Eg modes, the unified data are well captured by a simple empirical quadratic relation. These results establish Raman spectroscopy as a direct probe of the quantum metric and an operational decomposition of quantum geometry within a single measurement.

Title: Effect of Concentration Fluctuations on Material Properties of Disordered Alloys
Authors: Han-Pu Liang, Chuan-Nan Li, Xin-Ru Tang, Xun Xu, Chen Qiu, Qiu-Shi Huang, Su-Huai Wei
Abstract: Alloying compound AX with another compound BX is widely used to tune material properties. For disordered alloys, due to the lack of periodicity, it has been challenging to calculate and study their material properties. Special quasi-random structure (SQS) method has been developed and widely used to treat this issue by matching averaged atomic correlation functions to those of ideal random alloys, enabling accurate predictions of macroscopic material properties such as total energy and volume. However, in AxB1-x alloys, statistically allowed local concentration fluctuations can give rise to defect-like minority configurations, such as bulk-like AX or BX regions in the extreme, which could strongly affect calculation of some of the material properties such as semiconductor bandgap, if it is not defined properly, leading to significant discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, taking the bandgap as an example, we demonstrate that the calculated alloy bandgap can be significantly underestimated in standard SQS calculations when the SQS cell size is increased to improve the structural model and the bandgap is defined conventionally as the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied state and the highest occupied state, because the rare event motifs can lead to wavefunction localization and become the dominant factor in determining the "bandgap", contrary to experiment. To be consistent with experiment, we show that the bandgap of the alloy should be extracted from the majority configurations using a density-of-states fitting (DOSF) method. This DOSF approach resolves the long-standing issue of calculating electronic structure of disordered semiconductor alloys. Similar approaches should also be developed to treat material properties that depends on localized alloy wavefunctions.

Title: Probing the Liquid Solid Interfaces of 2D SnSe MXene Battery Anodes at the Nanoscale
Authors: Lukas Worch, Kavin Arunasalam, Neil Mulcahy, Syeda Ramin Jannat, James Douglas, Baptiste Gault, Valeria Nicolosi, Michele Shelly Conroy
Abstract: Understanding degradation processes in lithium ion batteries is essential for improving long term performance and advancing sustainable energy technologies. Tin selenide (SnSe) has emerged as a promising anode material due to the high theoretical capacity of tin. Unlike conventional intercalation based electrodes, SnSe undergoes conversion and alloying reactions with lithium to form Li4.4Sn, Sn, and Li2Se, enabling high lithium storage but inducing large volume changes that cause mechanical instability and capacity fading. Embedding SnSe nanoparticles within a Ti3C2Tx MXene framework offers a strategy to mitigate these effects by enhancing conductivity and structural resilience. Here, cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo FIB) slice and view revealed progressive material redistribution and morphological transformation during cycling, underscoring the need for site specific chemical analysis. Cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo APT) of selected regions provided high spatial and chemical resolution while preserving beam sensitive phases, uncovering nanoscale degradation mechanisms including phase transformations, partial dissolution of active material, and, importantly, the first direct evidence of copper corrosion and copper ion migration from the current collector into the electrode. The observation of copper redistribution demonstrates that current collector degradation contributes directly to chemical contamination and capacity fading in composite electrodes. Together, cryo FIB and cryo APT provide a powerful workflow for elucidating electrode degradation in reactive, beam sensitive systems, offering critical insights for designing more durable and stable next generation battery materials.

Title: Long-range propagating paramagnon-polaritons in organic free radicals
Authors: Sebastian Knauer, Roman Verba, Rostyslav O. Serha, Denys Slobodianiuk, David Schmoll, Andreas Ney, Sergej Demokritov, Andrii Chumak
Abstract: Materials are commonly distinguished by their magnetic response into diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and magnetically ordered (ferro-, ferri-, and antiferromagnetic) phases. Diamagnets and paramagnets lack spontaneous long-range order, whereas ordered magnets develop such order below their Curie or Néel temperature and support single spin-wave excitations (magnons). Magnons have found applications in radio-frequency technologies and computation, magneto-optics, and foundational quantum experiments. Above the Curie/Néel temperature, long-range order is lost and the material transitions to a paramagnetic phase, with localised spin alignment in small patches, producing paramagnons with only short-range propagation. Here we show that long-range coherence is preserved in the organic free radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl above the Néel temperature using all-electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy in external magnetic fields. We observe coherently excited low-energy paramagnon-polaritons up to $\mathbf{23\,\mathrm{GHz}}$ , propagating over $\mathbf{8\,\mathrm{mm}}$ at supersonic group velocities exceeding $\mathbf{100\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}}$. Using free radicals as magnon carriers integrates organic materials with spintronics and opens the way to organic electronics, dense information storage, and quantum technologies.

Title: Modification of Hanle and polarization recovery curves under interplay of hopping and quantum measurement back action
Authors: A. L. Zibinskiy, D. S. Smirnov
Abstract: The measurements of Hanle and polarization recovery effects for localized charge carriers are the basic tools for determining parameters of the spin dynamics, such as strength of the hyperfine interaction, for example, in quantum dots. We describe the dependence of the spin polarization of localized electrons on transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields taking into account the interplay between electron hopping and measurement back action. We show that these two have a qualitatively similar effect in the Faraday geometry, but compete in the Voigt geometry. This allows one to describe a broad range of the experimental results and study the fundamental effects of quantum measurements.

Title: Out-of-Plane Nonlinear Orbital Hall Torque
Authors: Hui Wang, Xukun Feng, Jin Cao, Huiying Liu, Weibo Gao, Cong Xiao, Shengyuan A. Yang, Lay Kee Ang
Abstract: Despite recent advances in orbitronics, generating out-of-plane orbital torques essential for field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization remains a key challenge. Here, we propose a strategy to produce such unconventional torques across broad classes of materials, by leveraging the nonlinear orbital Hall effect. We demonstrate that this nonlinear orbital response is dramatically amplified by topological band degeneracies, where it overwhelmingly dominates the spin response even in systems with strong spin-orbit coupling. These features are confirmed via a quantitative investigation of representative topological metals RhSi, YPtBi, and PbTaSe$_2$, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations. The resulting orbital torques substantially surpass those from linear mechanisms reported thus far. These findings propel the research of orbital transport into the nonlinear regime, broaden the scope of orbital source materials, and establish a new pathway towards high-performance orbitronic devices.

Title: Nonlinear morphoelastic energy based theory for stimuli responsive elastic shells
Authors: Matteo Taffetani, Matteo Pezzulla
Abstract: Large deformations play a central role in the shape transformations of slender active and biological structures. A classical example is the eversion of the Volvox embryo, which demonstrates the need for shell theories that can describe large strains, rotations, and the presence of incompatible stimuli. In this work, a reduced two-dimensional morphoelastic energy is derived from a fully nonlinear three-dimensional formulation. The resulting model describes the mechanics of naturally curved shells subjected to non-elastic stimuli acting through the thickness, thereby extending previous morphoelastic theories developed for flat plates to curved geometries. Two representative constitutive laws, corresponding to incompressible Neo-Hookean and compressible Ciarlet-Geymonat materials, are examined to highlight the influence of both geometric and constitutive nonlinearities. The theory is applied to the eversion of open and closed spherical shells and to vesiculation processes in biological systems. The results clarify how compressibility, curvature, and through-the-thickness kinematics govern snap-through and global deformation, extending classical morphoelastic shell models. The framework provides a consistent basis for analyzing large deformations in elastic and biological shells driven by non-mechanical stimuli.

Title: Stochastic Thermodynamics of Cooperative Biomolecular Machines: Fluctuation Relations and Hidden Detailed Balance Breaking
Authors: D. Evan Piephoff, Jianshu Cao
Abstract: We examine a biomolecular machine involving a driven, observable process coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative manner. A stochastic thermodynamics framework is employed to analyze a fluctuation theorem for the first-passage time of the observable process under nonequilibrium steady-state conditions. Based on a generic kinetic model, we demonstrate that, along first-passage trajectories, entropy production remains constant when the changes in stochastic entropy and free energy of the machine are balanced, which corresponds to zero net hidden flux through the initial state manifold. Under this condition, which we define quite generally, this first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be established, with its violation serving as an experimentally detectable signature of hidden detailed balance breaking (which we subsequently characterize). In addition, using an enzymatic model, we show that the violation of our first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be thought of as a consequence of the breakdown of local detailed balance in the steps linking coarse-grained states that correspond to the initial and intermediate state manifolds. In the absence of hidden current, the fluctuation theorem is restored, and a mesoscopic local detailed balance condition can be established, which has implications for the thermodynamic analysis of driven, coarse-grained systems. This work sheds significant light on the unique connections between stochastic thermodynamic quantities and kinetic measurements in complex cooperative networks.

Title: k-Selective Electrical-to-Magnon Transduction with Realistic Field-distributed Nanoantennas
Authors: Andreas Höfinger, Andrey A. Voronov, David Schmoll, Sabri Koraltan, Florian Bruckner, Claas Abert, Dieter Suess, Morris Lindner, Timmy Reimann, Carsten Dubs, Andrii V. Chumak, Sebastian Knauer
Abstract: The excitation and detection of propagating spin waves with lithographed nanoantennas underpin both classical magnonic circuits and emerging quantum technologies. Here, we establish a framework for all-electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy (AEPSWS) that links realistic electromagnetic drive fields to micromagnetic dynamics. Using finite-element (FE) simulations, we compute the full vector near-field of electrical impedance-matched, tapered coplanar and stripline antennas and import this distribution into finite-difference (FD) micromagnetic solvers. This approach captures the antenna-limited wave-vector spectrum and the component-selective driving fields (perpendicular to the static magnetisation) that simplified uniform-field models cannot. From this coupling, we derive how realistic current return paths and tapering shapes, k-weighting functions, for Damon-Eshbach surface spin waves in yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) films are, for millimetre-scale matched CPWs and linear tapers down to nanometre-scale antennas. Validation against experimental AEPSWS on a $48\,nm$ YIG film shows quantitative agreement in dispersion ridges, group velocities, and spectral peak positions, establishing that the antenna acts as a tunable k-space filter. These results provide actionable design rules for on-chip magnonic transducers, with immediate relevance for low-power operation regimes and prospective applications in quantum magnonics.

Title: Microwave Dressed States and Vacuum Fluctuations in a Superconducting Condensate
Authors: Anoop Dhillon, A. Hamed Majedi
Abstract: Microwave dressed states are found to emerge within the superconducting condensate when coupled to a quantized electromagnetic field due to photon-Cooper pair entanglement. The renormalized energy separation between these states exceeds the prediction of BCS theory, with the enhancement depending on the number of photons and also arising from electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. Our work introduces an equilibrium quantum model of microwave-enhanced superconductivity, expanding the theoretical description beyond Eliashberg's non-equilibrium theory. We further demonstrate that the superconducting condensate exerts a back-action on the electromagnetic field, suppressing electric field fluctuations, including those from the vacuum state. This result is consistent with Glauber and Lewenstein's field quantization in dielectric media.

Title: Point defects and their dynamic behaviors in silver monolayer intercalated between graphene and SiC
Authors: Van Dong Pham, Arpit Jain, Chengye Dong, Li-Syuan Lu, Joshua A. Robinson, Achim Trampert, Roman Engel-Herbert
Abstract: Point defects or impurities can give rise to sharp local modifications in the structure and electronic properties of two-dimensional metals, serving as an intriguing atomic-level solid-state model for both fundamental and application research. In this work, we investigated atomic-scale defects in a two-dimensional silver monolayer intercalated at the interface between epitaxial graphene and SiC using a scanning tunneling microscope. Distinct dark and bright defects are identified as in-plane vacancies and substitutional impurities within the silver monolayer, each hosting a localized electronic state induced solely by the defect. Remarkably, under excitation of tunneling electrons assisted by a negative bias voltage, the defects can hop inelastically which is reminiscent of the hydrogen switching in the cavity of an organic molecule. The hopping can be reversibly controlled by the scanning tunneling microscope tip, allowing the defects to function as atomic-scale two-level conductance switches. Defect hopping further allows us to gain a deeper understanding of their origins and the relationship between dark and bright defect species. This study constitutes a pathway toward understanding and controlling defects in two-dimensional metals with atomic precision, revealing previously unexplored dynamic behavior with potential applications in nanoelectronics.

Title: Flocking transition in phoretically interacting active particles with pinning disorder
Authors: Sagarika Adhikary, Arvin Gopal Subramaniam, Rajesh Singh
Abstract: Recent studies in the collective behavior of active colloids have shown that a global polar order may emerge due to long-ranged chemo-repulsive interactions between them. Here, we report the role of pinning disorder in the flocking transition for such a system. To this end, we study the problem of chemically interacting active colloids with some fraction of the colloids randomly pinned over space such that they can only rotate while phoretically interacting with other particles. Using this model, we investigate the sustenance of global polar order in the presence of quenched disorder. We quantify the flocking transition by studying the global polarization, and the role of finite-size effects. We find that in the crystalline flocking phase, even a small fraction of pinning can destroy spatial crystalline order, although polar order in the form of a liquid phase is maintained. It is observed that polar order is sustained in a system with a higher pinning fraction if the long-ranged repulsive force is subsequently increased. However, in absence of chemo-repulsive forces between particles, polar order drastically decreases even with a smaller pinning fraction. Overall, this work suggests a novel route of solid-to-liquid transition that can be induced via "translationally inert" obstacles, that rotate but do not translate whilst interacting with the bulk.

Title: Backbone three-point correlation function in the two-dimensional Potts model
Authors: Ming Li, Youjin Deng, Jesper Lykke Jacobsen, Jesús Salas
Abstract: We study the three-point correlation function of the backbone in the two-dimensional $Q$-state Potts model using the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) representation. The backbone is defined as the bi-connected skeleton of an FK cluster after removing all dangling ends and bridges. To circumvent the severe critical slowing down in direct Potts simulations for large $Q$, we employ large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the O$(n)$ loop model on the hexagonal lattice, which is regarded to correspond to the Potts model with $Q=n^2$. Using a highly efficient cluster algorithm, we compute the universal three-point amplitude ratios for the backbone ($R_\text{BB}$) and FK clusters ($R_\text{FK}$). Our computed $R_\text{FK}$ exhibits excellent agreement with exact conformal field theory predictions, validating the reliability of our numerical approach. In the critical regime, we find that $R_\text{BB}$ is systematically larger than $R_\text{FK}$. Conversely, along the tricritical branch, $R_\text{BB}$ and $R_\text{FK}$ coincide within numerical accuracy, strongly suggesting that $R_\text{BB}=R_\text{FK}$ holds throughout this regime. This finding mirrors the known equality of the backbone and FK cluster fractal dimensions at tricriticality, jointly indicating that both structures share the same geometric universality.

Title: Spin and lattice dynamics at the spin-reorientation transitions in the rare-earth orthoferrite Sm$_{0.55}$Tb$_{0.45}$FeO$_{3}$
Authors: R.M. Dubrovin, A.I. Brulev, N.R. Vovk, I.A. Eliseyev, N.N. Novikova, V.A. Chernyshev, A.N. Smirnov, V.Yu. Davydov, Anhua Wu, Liangbi Su, R.V. Mikhaylovskiy, A.M. Kalashnikova, R.V. Pisarev
Abstract: Linear and non-linear couplings of magnetic and lattice excitations are at the heart of many fascinating magnetophononic phenomena observed in rare-earth orthoferrites, the distinctive feature of which is the tendency to spin-reorientation transitions. Here we report the results of the experimental study of the spin and lattice dynamics in the Brillouin zone center of the rare-earth orthoferrite Sm$_{0.55}$Tb$_{0.45}$FeO$_{3}$ by using polarized infrared reflectivity and Raman scattering spectroscopic techniques. The obtained results were supported by the first-principles calculations, which allowed us to reliably identify the parameters of most infrared- and Raman-active phonons. We reveal the spin-reorientation transitions $\Gamma_{4}(G_{a}F_{c}) \overset{T_{1}}\longleftrightarrow \Gamma_{24}(G_{ac}F_{ac}) \overset{T_{2}}\longleftrightarrow \Gamma_{2}(G_{c}F_{a})$ at $T_{1} \simeq 220$ K and $T_{2} \simeq 130$ K and carefully studied the following evolution of Raman scattering on magnetic excitations at these transitions. Notably, the intermediate magnetic structure $\Gamma_{24}$ displays an exceptionally broad temperature range $\Delta{T} = T_{1} - T_{2} \simeq 90$ K in mixed Sm$_{0.55}$Tb$_{0.45}$FeO$_{3}$ compared to pure rare-earth orthoferrites. We attribute this broadening of the intermediate phase to the modification of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy as a result of the inhomogeneous magnetic structure caused by the random distribution of rare-earth $\mathrm{Sm}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Tb}^{3+}$ ions. We found neither change in the parameters of Raman-active $B_{1g}$ phonons nor the appearance of new phonons induced by spin-reorientation transitions, which have been reported in $\mathrm{SmFeO}_{3}$. We assume that our results provide a solid basis for more deeper understanding of magnetophononic phenomena in rare-earth orthoferrites.

Title: Chromatic Zeros on the Limit $G^{(p,\ell)}_\infty$ of the Family $G^{(p,\ell)}_m$ of Hierarchical Graphs
Authors: Shu-Chiuan Chang, Robert Shrock
Abstract: We calculate the continuous accumulation set ${\cal B}_q(p,\ell)$ of zeros of the chromatic polynomial $P(G^{(p,\ell)}_m,q)$ in the limit $m \to \infty$, on a family of graphs $G^{(p,\ell)}_m$ defined such that $G^{(p,\ell)}_m$ is obtained from $G^{(p,\ell)}_{m-1}$ by replacing each edge (i.e., bond) on $G^{(p,\ell)}_m$ by $p$ paths each of length $\ell$ edges, starting with the tree graph $T_2$. Our method uses the property that the chromatic polynomial $P(G,q)$ of a graph $G$ is equal to the $v=-1$ evaluation of the partition function of the $q$-state Potts model, together with (i) the property that $Z(G^{(p,\ell)}_m,q,v)$ can be expressed via an exact closed-form real-space renormalization (RG) group transformation in terms of $Z(G^{(p,\ell)}_{m-1},q,v')$, where $v'=F_{(p,\ell),q}(v)$ is a rational function of $v$ and $q$ and (ii) ${\cal B}_q(p,\ell)(v)$ is the locus in the complex $q$-plane that separates regions of different asymptotic behavior of the $m$-fold iterated RG transformation $F_{(p,\ell),q}(v)$ in the $m \to \infty$ limit. Thus, our results involve calculations of region diagrams in the complex $q$-plane showing the type of behavior that occurs in the $m \to \infty$ limit of the $m$-fold iterated RG transformation mapping $F_{(p,\ell),q}(v)$ starting with the initial value $v=v_0=-1$. Calculations are presented of the maximal point $q_c(G^{(p,\ell)}_\infty)$ at which the locus ${\cal B}_q$ crosses the real-$q$ axis, as well as several other points at which, depending on $p$ and $\ell$, the locus ${\cal B}_q$ crosses this axis. We give explicit results for a variety of $(p,\ell)$ cases and observe a number of interesting features. Calculations of the ground-state degeneracy of the Potts antiferromagnet at $q_c(G^{(p,\ell)}_\infty)$ are presented. This work extends a previous study with R. Roeder of the $(p,\ell)=(2,2)$ case to higher $p$ and $\ell$ values.

Title: Routes to the density profile and structural inconsistency
Authors: S. M. Tschopp, H. Vahid, J. M. Brader
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (DFT) is the primary method for investigations of inhomogeneous fluids in external fields. It requires the excess Helmholtz free energy functional as input to an Euler-Lagrange equation for the one-body density. A variant of this methodology, the force-DFT, uses instead the Yvon-Born-Green equation to generate density profiles. It is known that the latter are consistent with the virial route to the thermodynamics, while DFT is consistent with the compressibility route. In this work we will show an alternative DFT scheme using the Lovett-Mou-Buff-Wertheim (LMBW) equation to obtain density profiles, that are shown to be also consistent with the compressibility route. However, force-DFT and LMBW DFT can both be implemented using a closure relation on the level of the two-body correlation functions. This is proven to be an advantageous feature, opening the possibility of an optimisation scheme in which the structural inconsistency between different routes to the density profile is minimized. (Structural inconsistency is a generalization of the notion of thermodynamic inconsistency, familiar from bulk integral equation studies.) Numerical results are given for the density profiles of two-dimensional systems of hard-core Yukawa particles with a repulsive or an attractive tail, in planar geometry.

Title: Exploring the Role of Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction in Write Error Rate Anomalies of Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Tunnel Junctions
Authors: Prosenjit Das, Md Mahadi Rajib, Jayasimha Atulasimha
Abstract: The performance and reliability of spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory (STT-MRAM) can be compromised by anomalous switching behavior, especially during high-speed operations. One such anomaly, known as the "ballooning effect" is characterized by an unexpected non-monotonic increase in the write error rate (WER) with increase in STT current at specific current pulse durations. In this study, we systematically investigate the role of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) on such WER anomaly using micromagnetic simulations of 20 nm and 50 nm magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). We show that DMI promotes incoherent magnetization reversal, prolongs the switching time and creates intermediate multidomain states that result in incomplete reversal. At high DMI values, these states persist even under large switching current densities, reproducing ballooning-like anomalies reported experimentally. In contrast, longer pulses overcome these effects by allowing the system sufficient time to reach a stable state. Our findings show that interfacial DMI can play a role in the ballooning effect and point to interfacial engineering as a practical strategy for improving the reliability of next-generation STT-MRAM.

Title: The True Parent Phase of K1.9Fe4.2Se5: A Stripe-type Orthorhombic Phase Requiring a Superconducting Distortion
Authors: Chih-Han Wang, Jie-Yu Yang, Wu Phillip M, Gwo-Tzong Huang, Ming-Jye Wang, Maw-Kuen Wu
Abstract: The origin of the four-fold Tc amplification in A_xFe_{2-y}Se_2 (>30 K) compared to FeSe (8 K) remains a central puzzle, complicated by a debate over the true superconducting (SC) parent phase--the I4/m (245) insulating matrix or a supposed I4/mmm metallic phase. Here, we resolve this ambiguity by identifying a novel "stripe-type orthorhombic phase" as the true parent phase of the high-Tc state, whose diffraction signature is the d2 peaks. Through decisive experiments, we demonstrate that this d2 parent phase is not intrinsically superconducting. Instead, superconductivity emerges only after this stripe phase undergoes a subsequent structural distortion, the definitive signature of which is the asymmetric broadening of the d1 main peaks. Our findings establish that the d2 peaks signal the formation of the parent phase, while the broadening of d1 peaks signals the transition into the superconducting state. This discovery of a two-step transition--formation of a stripe parent phase, followed by a superconducting distortion--provides a new mechanism for Tc amplification via controlled heterogeneity.

Title: Time-resolved splitting of magnons into vortex gyration and Floquet spin waves
Authors: T. Devolder, R. Lopes Seeger, C. Heins, A. Jenkins, L. C. Benetti, A. Schulman, R. Ferreira, G. Philippe, C. Chappert, H. Schultheiss, K. Schultheiss, J.-V. Kim
Abstract: Forced excitations at frequencies in the range of the first order azimuthal spin waves of a magnetic disk in the vortex state are known to scatter into the vortex gyration mode, thereby allowing the growth of Floquet spin waves forming a frequency comb. We study the temporal emergence of this dynamical state using time-resolved microwave electrical measurements. The most intense Floquet mode emerges synchronously with the gyration mode after a common incubation delay which diverges at the scattering threshold. This delay is minimal when the drive is resonant with one of the first order azimuthal spin waves. It can be as short as 3 ns for the maximum investigated power. We conclude that the first-to-occur scattering mechanism is the three-wave splitting of a regular azimuthal eigenmode into a coherent pair formed by a gyration magnon and a Floquet spin wave.

Title: Elastic Dislocation-based Skyrmion Traps: Fundamentals and Applications
Authors: Martín Latorre, Joaquín Barra, Juan Pablo Vera, Joaquín Martinez, Mario Castro, Sebastián Allende, Alvaro S. Nunez
Abstract: Topologically secure spin configurations, such as skyrmions and bimerons, offer a compelling alternative to conventional magnetic domains, potentially enabling high-density, low-power spintronic devices. These pseudo-particles, characterized by their swirling spin textures and nontrivial topological charges, are prevalent and notably influence their electronic, magnetic, and mechanical traits. This paper provides an in-depth overview of the interaction between a screw dislocation within a distorted magnetic lattice, exploring possible coupling mechanisms and establishing a promising link between two disparate topics in materials science: topological magnetism and topological elasticity. We first provide a classical analysis of skyrmion motion that reveals the dislocations as shallow traps on the magnetic texture. Afterwards, we provide an analysis of the quantized motion of the skyrmion and identify its quantum states. We conclude by illustrating how the ideas in our paper can be implemented in simple yet compelling devices based on the shallow traps from an array of dislocations acting as frets in a race-track, controlling the motion with a low current activation mechanism.

Title: Broadband nonlinear Hall response and multiple wave mixing in a room temperature altermagnet
Authors: Soumya Sankar, Xingkai Cheng, Xinyu Chen, Xizhi Fu, Takahiro Urata Wataru Hattori, Wenlong Lu, Zihan Lin, Dong Chen, Claudia Felser, Hiroshi Ikuta, Junzhang Ma, Junwei Liu, Berthold Jäck
Abstract: Crystalline symmetries determine the linear and nonlinear response of materials to external stimuli such as mechanical pressure and electromagnetic fields, governing phenomena such as piezoelectricity, optical activity, and multiple wave mixing with wide ranging technological applications. Altermagnets present a new class of materials with magnetic crystalline order where specific crystal symmetry operations connect antiferromagnetic sublattices, leading to non-relativistic spin-splitting of the electronic band structure. Hence, the electric material properties of altermagnets should uniquely mirror these underlying symmetry properties, potentially giving rise to novel phenomena in response to external driving fields. Here, we report the discovery of a broadband third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in altermagnetic CrSb at room temperature. The comparison of our observations with symmetry analyses and model calculations shows that this nonlinear Hall response is induced by the nonlinear electric susceptibility of a Berry curvature quadrupole, which exists within the spin-split band structure of CrSb and is characterized by the underlying crystalline and magnetic symmetries. We then utilize this third-order nonlinear electric susceptibility of CrSb to realize a multiple wave mixing device with pronounced four wave mixing output, which could, in principle, be extended to THz frequencies. Our study discovers that the crystalline magnetic order of altermagnets determines their nonlinear electric material properties, which could facilitate applications in high-frequency electronics, THz generation, communication networks, and energy harvesting.

Title: Relaxation approach to quantum-mechanical modeling of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phase transitions
Authors: Nikhilesh Maity, Sergey Lisenkov, Arlies Valdespino, Milan Haddad, Lewys Jones, Amit Kumar, Nazanin Bassiri-Gharb, Inna Ponomareva
Abstract: Ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics are the electric counterparts of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. These materials undergo temperature- and electric-field-induced phase transitions that give rise to their characteristic hysteresis loops. Modeling such hysteresis loops and associated phase transitions enables both a deeper fundamental understanding and reliable property predictions for this important class of materials. To date, modeling has largely relied on classical approaches, often remaining qualitative and/or empirical. Traditional interpretation of these transitions rests on two assumptions: (i) they are activated Arrhenius-type processes and (ii) they occur well within the classical regime. Here, we demonstrate that a model can instead be built on two ''orthogonal`` assumptions: (i) the phase transitions are relaxational processes and (ii) they require a quantum mechanical treatment. Applying this model to both antiferroelectrics and ferroelectrics overcomes the limitations of traditional models and enables efficient first-principles simulations of phase transitions. Furthermore, the success of our unconventional approach highlights the significance of quantum mechanics in transitions long regarded as purely classical. We anticipate that this framework will be applicable to a broad range of phase transitions, including magnetic, elastic, multiferroic, and electronic, along with modeling of quantum tunneling, rates of chemical reactions, and others.

Title: Spin Liquids on the Tetratrillium Lattice
Authors: Matías G. Gonzalez, Johannes Reuther
Abstract: The tetratrillium lattice has recently been proposed as responsible for the dynamical properties observed in the $S=1$ langbeinite compound K$_2$Ni$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$. Here, we study in detail the classical spin liquid properties of this lattice of tri-coordinated tetrahedra using classical Monte Carlo and large-$N$ theory calculations. In the large-$N$ limit, we find that the system presents a gapped spectrum with flat bottom bands, giving rise to a fragile spin liquid with exponentially decaying correlations according to the classification of classical spin liquids. We confirm that this scenario also holds in the more realistic Ising and Heisenberg cases, for which the system does not exhibit any finite-temperature phase transition, and the low-temperature spin structure factors exhibit excellent quantitative agreement with the large-$N$ theory. We also provide insight into the quantum $S=1/2$ limit by performing pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group calculations at finite temperatures, and discuss the possible phases that can arise in the ground state due to quantum fluctuations.

Title: Tuning the Critical Current in Toroidal Superfluids via Controllable Impurities
Authors: K. Xhani, G. Del Pace, N. Grani, D. Hernández-Rajkov, B. Donelli, G. Roati, L. Pezzè
Abstract: We combine numerical and experimental approaches to study how impurities affect the maximum superflow in an annular Bose-Einstein condensate. By tuning the impurity density, we achieve precise control over the stability of persistent currents which increases with the impurity number. In the unstable regime, the complex vortex motion within the impurity landscape, characterized by pinning and unpinning events, governs the timescale of the current decay and its final value. Our work establishes atomic superfluids as a pristine platform for exploring universal mechanisms of superflow stabilization and decay, paving the way for atomtronic quantum technologies.

Title: From One to Two Dimensions: Magnetic Phases in Weakly Coupled Spin Ladders
Authors: Mateo Cárdenes Wuttig, Andrew J. Millis
Abstract: A large variety of materials can be approximately described by means of spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladders. Here, the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm together with a previously established numerical self-consistent mean-field approximation is used to investigate the magnetic properties of spin ladders coupled in a second dimension. The full ground state phase diagram including spin-gapped, antiferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and fully polarized phases is presented as a function of interladder and intraladder coupling and magnetic field. Measurement of the dependence of magnetization on applied magnetic field is shown to enable location of a material on the phase diagram and determination of the Hamiltonian parameters. These results provide a practical route toward identifying and characterizing magnetic materials composed of coupled spin ladders.

Title: In-vacuum surface flashover of SiN, AlN, and etched SiO2 thin films at micrometre scales
Authors: Vijay Kumar, Martin Siegele-Brown, Matthew Aylett, Sebastian Weidt, Winfried Karl Hensinger
Abstract: We investigate the surface flashover voltage threshold for SiO$_2$, SiN, and AlN thin films over micrometre scale lengths. Furthermore, we test the effects of different etching chemistries on SiO$_2$ layers. We find that there is little significant difference between untreated SiO$_2$ samples and those that have been etched with hydrogen fluoride or Transene AlPad Etch 639. SiN and AlN samples performed significantly better than all SiO$_2$ samples giving a 45% increase in surface flashover voltage at a distance of 5 $\mu$m with the difference increasing with electrode spacing.

Title: Excitonic Landscapes in Monolayer Lateral Heterostructures Revealed by Unsupervised Machine Learning
Authors: Maninder Kaur, Nicolas T. Sandino, Jason P. Terry, Mahdi Ghafariasl, Yohannes Abate
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) in-plane heterostructures including compositionally graded alloys and lateral heterostructures with defined interfaces display rich optoelectronic properties and offer versatile platforms to explore one-dimensional interface physics and many-body interaction effects. Graded \(\mathrm{Mo}_x\mathrm{W}_{1-x}\mathrm{S}_2\) alloys show smooth spatial variations in composition and strain that continuously tune excitonic emission, while \(\mathrm{MoS}_2\)--\(\mathrm{WS}_2\) lateral heterostructures contain atomically sharp interfaces supporting one-dimensional excitonic phenomena. These single-layer systems combine tunable optical and electronic properties with potential for stable, high-performance optoelectronic devices. Hyperspectral and nano-resolved photoluminescence (PL) imaging enable spatial mapping of optical features along with local variations in composition, strain, and defects, but manual interpretation of such large datasets is slow and subjective. Here, we introduce a fast and scalable unsupervised machine-learning (ML) framework to extract quantitative and interpretable information from hyperspectral PL datasets of graded \(\mathrm{Mo}_x\mathrm{W}_{1-x}\mathrm{S}_2\) alloys and \(\mathrm{MoS}_2\)--\(\mathrm{WS}_2\) heterostructures. Combining principal-component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and density-based spatial clustering (DBSCAN), we uncover spectrally distinct domains associated with composition, strain, and defect variations. Decomposition of representative spectra reveals multiple emission species, including band-edge excitons and defect-related transitions, demonstrating that ML-driven analysis provides a robust and automated route to interpret rich optical properties of 2D materials.

Title: Competition of fermion pairing, magnetism, and charge order in the spin-doped attractive Hubbard gas
Authors: Thomas Hartke, Botond Oreg, Chunhan Feng, Carter Turnbaugh, Jens Hertkorn, Yuan-Yao He, Ningyuan Jia, Ehsan Khatami, Shiwei Zhang, Martin Zwierlein
Abstract: The tension between fermion pairing and magnetism affects numerous strongly correlated electron systems, from high-temperature cuprates to twisted bilayer graphene. Exotic forms of fermion pairing and superfluidity are predicted when attraction between fermions competes with spin doping. Here, we follow the evolution of fermion pairing and charge and spin order in a spin-imbalanced attractive Hubbard gas of fermionic $^{40}$K atoms, covering a wide range of densities, magnetizations, and interactions with single-atom resolution. At low spin imbalance and weak interactions, we find a mixture of nonlocal fermion pairs coexisting with itinerant excess fermions. For stronger interactions an effective hard-core Bose-Fermi mixture emerges. Spin doping drives a crossover from charge-density wave correlations to a Fermi liquid of polarons. Beyond a certain spin imbalance and interaction strength, we find evidence for the onset of combined spin- and pair-density wave order, a possible precursor for the existence of magnetized superfluidity in the attractive Hubbard system.

Title: Uniaxial strain tuning of polar lattice vibrations in KTaO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$
Authors: I. Khayr, N. Somun, S. Hameed, Z. Van Fossan, X. He, R. Spieker, S. Chi, E. Clements, D. M. Pajerowski, M. Minola, B. Keimer, T. Birol, D. Pelc, M. Greven
Abstract: The interplay of electronic and structural degrees of freedom is a prominent feature of many quantum materials and of particular interest in systems with strong ferroelectric fluctuations, such as SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and KTaO$_3$ (KTO). Both materials are close to a ferroelectric transition, but despite six decades of extensive research, pivotal questions regarding the nature of this transition and of the associated fluctuations remain debated. Here we combine inelastic neutron scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations to study the evolution of soft polar phonons across the strain-induced ferroelectric transition in STO and KTO. We find that the modes remain underdamped and at nonzero energy, consistent with a first-order quantum phase transition. We also reveal a strong violation of the well-known Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation between the phonon energies and static dielectric permittivities in insulating KTO and STO, which is not captured by ab initio calculations and points to the presence of slow mesoscale fluctuations induced by long-range interactions. In metallic STO, we uncover a first-order transition at a remarkably low critical stress, in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions. The present work resolves several long-standing questions pertaining to the model systems STO and KTO and is relevant to numerous other materials with soft polar phonons.

Title: Supernematic
Authors: Dan Mao, Eun-Ah Kim
Abstract: Quantum theory of geometrically frustrated systems is usually approached as a gauge theory where the local conservation law becomes the Gauss law. Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order. This establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints.

Abstract: In addition to topological lattice defects such as dislocations and disclinations, crystals are also accompanied by unavoidable ordinary defects, devoid of any non-trivial geometry or topology, among which vacancies, Schottky defects, substitutions, interstitials, and Frenkel pairs are the most common. In this work, we demonstrate that these ubiquitous ordinary lattice defects, though topologically trivial, can nonetheless serve as universal probes of the non-trivial topology of electronic Bloch bands, and any change in the local topological environment in an otherwise normal insulator in terms of mid-gap bound states in their vicinity. We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices.

Title: Nanobubble size controls gas hydrate nucleation in supercooled water
Authors: Ramkhelavan Kanaujiya, Atanu K. Metya, Rajnish Kumar, Tarak K Patra
Abstract: Gas hydrates are crystalline compounds formed when water molecules encapsulate guest gas molecules under high pressure and low temperatures. They have gained significant interest due to their potential as alternative energy resources and their applications in gas storage, transportation, and carbon sequestration. However, the fundamental mechanisms governing their formation, especially the influence of gas bubbles, remain poorly understood. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine how methane nanobubble size modulates hydrate formation in supercooled water. Nanobubbles of different sizes are generated by modulating the methane concentration in a methane-water mixture during equilibration under high-temperature and low-pressure conditions, followed by quenching to low temperature and high pressure to induce gas hydrate nucleation and subsequent growth. The simulations reveal a strong correlation between nanobubble size and the extent of hydrate formation. Specifically, the extent of hydrate formation increases with bubble size in the small-to-intermediate regime. However, beyond a critical bubble size threshold, the hydrate formation efficiency declines. The work provides new molecular-level insight into how nanobubble size modulates gas hydrate nucleation and growth dynamics.

Title: Quantum Frustration as a Protection Mechanism in Non-Topological Majorana Qubits
Authors: E. Novais
Abstract: I analyze the decoherence of a $\pi$-junction qubit encoded by two co-located Majorana modes. Although not topologically protected, the qubit leverages distinct spatial profiles to couple to two independent environmental baths, realizing the phenomenon of quantum this http URL mechanism is tested against the threat of quasiparticle poisoning (QP). I show that frustration is effective against Ohmic noise ($s=1$) and has some protection for $0.76<s<1$ sub-Ohmic noise. However, the experimentally prevalent $1/f$ noise ($s\to0$) falls deep within the model's localized phase, where frustration is insufficient. This causes Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and catastrophic decoherence. The qubit's viability depends on what is the effective environment that these local Majorana wave functions experience.

Title: A master equation approach to the n-coalescent problem
Authors: Bahram Houchmandzadeh (LIPhy)
Abstract: Given an evolutionary model, such as Wright--Fisher (WF) or Moran, the n-coalescent problem consists of going backward in time to find for example the time to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) and the topology of the tree. In the literature, this problem is tackled mostly by computing directly the random variable t, time to reach the MRCA. I show here that by shifting the focus from the random variable t to the joined variable (n,t), where n is the number of ancestors at time t, the problem is greatly simplified. Indeed, P(n,t), the probability of this variable, obeys a simpler master equation that can be solved in a straightforward way for the most general model. This probability can then be used to compute relevant information of the n-coalescent, for both random variables $t_{n}$ (random time to reach a given state n) and $n_{t}$ (random number of ancestors at a given time t). The cumulative distribution function for $t_{1}$ for example is $P(1,t)$. I give in this article the general solution for continuous time models such as Moran and discrete time ones such as WF.

Title: Cooling the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model using thermofield double states
Authors: Thomas Schuster, Bryce Kobrin, Vincent P. Su, Hugo Marrochio, Norman Y. Yao
Abstract: We analyze a simple and efficient experimental protocol to cool the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model to low temperatures. The protocol utilizes local couplings between two copies of an SYK model to create a gapped adiabatic path, between a high temperature product state and a low temperature thermofield double state. By smoothly varying the coupling strength between these two limits, one efficiently cools the SYK model. We support these predictions-and demonstrate fast cooling to the low-temperature gravitational regime-via exact numerical solutions to the large-N equations of motion that govern the ground state and dynamical properties of the coupled system. Finally, we present a theoretical framework based upon eigenstate thermalization that provides a microscopic explanation for the efficacy of the cooling protocol; intriguingly, this suggests that the protocol may be applicable for cooling strongly-interacting quantum Hamiltonians more broadly.

Title: Mutual information as a measure of renormalizability
Authors: Brenden Bowen, Albert Farah, Spasen Chaykov, Nishant Agarwal
Abstract: Renormalization is an essential technique in field-theoretic descriptions of natural phenomena, where the absence of a UV-complete description yields an abundance of divergent quantities. While the renormalization prescription has been thoroughly refined for equilibrium systems, consistently extending it to out-of-equilibrium systems is an active area of research. In this paper, we identify a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability that applies to quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. Specifically, we use mutual information to characterize correlations between infinitesimal shells in momentum space and show that the logarithmic derivative of mutual information with mode separation, at large mode separation, is a measure of renormalizability. We first consider Minkowski spacetime, where we introduce dynamics by performing an interaction quench, initializing the field in the free theory vacuum and then turning on the interaction. We show that the late-time mutual information relaxes to that for the interacting vacuum and the logarithmic derivative at large mode separation is negative for super-renormalizable theories, zero for renormalizable (marginal) theories, and positive for non-renormalizable theories. We then consider a conformally-coupled scalar field on the Poincaré patch of de Sitter spacetime, initializing the field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the asymptotic past. For different self-interactions and at any finite time, we find that the resulting mutual information has the same qualitative behavior as a function of mode separation, demonstrating that it can be used as a reliable indicator of renormalizability.

Title: Temporal quantum interference in many-body programmable atom arrays
Authors: Madhumita Sarkar, Ben Zindorf, Bhaskar Mukherjee, Sougato Bose, Roopayan Ghosh
Abstract: Quantum superposition famously manifests as spatial interference, epitomized by the double-slit experiment. Its less explored temporal analogue, Stückelberg interference, arises in driven systems where phases accumulated along distinct time-domain pathways recombine. Extending this phenomenon to large interacting systems introduces a new complexity as delicate phase relationships are disrupted by many-body interactions. Here we experimentally achieve controllable vacuum-state freezing in programmable Rydberg arrays of up to 100 atoms through many-body Stückelberg interference, with visibility exceeding $70\%$ and excitation suppression to $1\%$ despite periodic driving that would typically induce heating. Comparing single and dual-frequency protocols across multiple geometries, we show that simultaneous modulation of detuning and Rabi frequency dramatically enhances interference-driven freezing. Finite-range interaction tails play a decisive role, producing interference patterns which constrained $PXP$ models cannot capture. Our results establish temporal interference as a scalable microscopic mechanism for Floquet control, enabling predictive many-body state engineering in large-scale platforms.

Title: Non-abelian Geometric Quantum Energy Pump
Authors: Yang Peng
Abstract: We introduce a non-abelian geometric quantum energy pump realized by a transitionless geometric quantum drive--a time-dependent Hamiltonian supplemented by a counterdiabatic term generated by a prescribed trajectory on a smooth control manifold--that coherently transports states within a degenerate subspace. When the coordinates of the trajectory are independently addressable by external drives, the net energy transferred between drives is set by the non-abelian Berry-curvature tensor. The trajectory-averaged pumping power is separately controlled by the initial state and by the Hamiltonian topology through the Euler class. We outline an implementation with artificial atoms, which are realizable on various platforms including trapped atoms/ions, superconducting circuits, and semiconductor quantum dots. The resulting energy pump can serve as a quantum transducer or charger, and as a metrological tool for measuring phase coherences in quantum states.

Title: Geometry Induced Chiral Transport and Entanglement in $AdS_2$ Background
Authors: Kazuki Ikeda, Yaron Oz
Abstract: We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.

Title: Temperature-dependent excitonic light manipulation with atomically-thin optical elements
Authors: Ludovica Guarneri, Qitong Li, Thomas Bauer, Jung-Hwan Song, Ashley P. Saunders, Fang Liu, Mark L. Brongersma, Jorik van de Groep
Abstract: Monolayer 2D semiconductors, such as WS2, exhibit uniquely strong light-matter interactions due to exciton resonances that enable atomically-thin optical elements. Similar to geometry-dependent plasmon and Mie resonances, these intrinsic material resonances offer coherent and tunable light scattering. Thus far, the impact of the excitons temporal dynamics on the performance of such excitonic metasurfaces remains unexplored. Here, we show how the excitonic decay rates dictate the focusing efficiency of an atomically-thin lens carved directly out of exfoliated monolayer WS2. By isolating the coherent exciton radiation from the incoherent background in the focus of the lens, we obtain a direct measure of the role of exciton radiation in wavefront shaping. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of exciton-phonon scattering by characterizing the focusing efficiency as a function of temperature, demonstrating an increased optical efficiency at cryogenic temperatures. Our results provide valuable insights in the role of excitonic light scattering in 2D nanophotonic devices.

Title: Local arrows of time in quantum many-body systems
Authors: Andrew G. Yates, Jordan Cotler, Nishad Maskara, Mikhail D. Lukin
Abstract: We demonstrate that in quantum many-body systems, local arrows of time can differ from the global time $t$ induced by Hamiltonian evolution. That is, within a quantum many-body system, the flow of time can be relative to each observer or by proxy each local subsystem. We provide a definition of local arrows of time in quantum many-body systems, and explain their relation to spacetime quantum entropies. Then we give a variety of numerical and analytical examples which explore different ways in which local arrows of time can manifest in quantum many-body dynamics, including exotic arrows of time arising from quantum thermalization and quantum error correction.

Title: Broadband Solar Selective Absorber with Dallenbach-type Bilayer Structure Achieved Using Carbon Nanotube Membranes with Tailored Optical Spectra
Authors: Hengkai Wu, Taishi Nishihara, Mioko Hizukuri, Takeshi Tanaka, Hiromichi Kataura, Yuhei Miyauchi
Abstract: Spectrally selective absorbers that maximize solar absorption and minimize thermal radiation loss are crucial for efficient solar thermal energy harvesting. However, limitations imposed by the intrinsic properties of conventional materials hinder the fabrication of interference-based absorbers with desired optical properties. Herein, a high-performance solar absorber with a Dallenbach-type dielectric-metal tandem structure was fabricated using an ultrathin, subquarter-wavelength thickness single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) membrane with tailored optical spectra as the absorbing layer. By mixing multiple SWCNT chiral structures, the optical response of the absorbing layer was tailored to approximate a theoretical complex refractive index spectrum of dielectrics; therefore enabling high solar absorptance, low infrared emittance, and a low angular dependence with a simple bilayer structure. The fabricated proof-of-concept 1 cm$^2$ absorber exhibited excellent spectral selectivity (solar absorptance/infrared emittance of 0.84/0.03), and an equilibrium temperature of $\approx 190^\circ$C ($270^\circ$C) under nonconcentrated ($2\times$ concentrated) sunlight, considerably outperformed a blackbody-like absorber. This study presents a high-performance solar absorber with a simple planar structure and proposes a concept of designing dielectric with the desired optical properties by mixing various types of structure-sorted SWCNTs.

Title: The zipper condition for $4$-tensors in two-dimensional topological order and the higher relative commutants of a subfactor arising from a commuting square
Authors: Yasuyuki Kawahigashi
Abstract: They recently study two-dimensional topological order in condensed matter physics in terms of tensor networks involving certain 3- and 4-tensors. Their 3-tensors satisfying the ``zipper condition'' play an important role there. We identify their 4-tensors with bi-unitary connections in Jones' subfactor theory in operator algebras with precise normalization constants. Then we prove that their tensors satisfying the zipper condition are the same as flat fields of strings in subfactor theory which correspond to elements in the higher relative commutants of the subfactor arising from the bi-unitary connection. This is what we expect, since the zipper condition is a kind of pentagon relations, but we clarify what conditions are exactly needed for this -- we do not need the flatness or the finite depth condition for the bi-unitary connection. We actually generalize their 4-tensors so that the four index sets of the 4-tensors can be all different and work on a ``half-version'' of the zipper condition.

Title: Lanthanides-Based Nanoparticles Conjugated with Rose Bengal for FRET-Mediated X-Ray-Induced PDT

Abstract: In order to find a good candidate for F{ö}rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-mediated X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) for the treatment of cancer, lanthanide (Ln)-based AGuIX nanoparticles (NPs) conjugated with Rose Bengal (RB) as a photosensitizer (PS) were synthesized. X-PDT overcomes the problem of the poor penetration of visible light into tissues, which limits the efficacy of PDT in the treatment of deep-seated tumors. It is essential to optimize FRET efficiency by maximizing the overlap integral between donor emission and acceptor absorption and lengthening the duration of the donor emission. In this study, we optimized energy transfer between a scintillator (Sc) as a donor and a PS as an acceptor. Terbium (Tb) and Gadolinium (Gd) as Scs and Rose RB as a PS were chosen. The study of energy transfer between Tb, Gd and RB in solution and chelated on AGuIX NPs proved to be FRET-like. RB was conjugated directly onto AGuIX NPs (i.e., AGuIX Ln@RB), and the use of a spacer arm (i.e., AGuIX Ln@spacer arm-RB) increased FRET efficiency. Singlet oxygen production by these NPs was observed under UV--visible illumination and X-ray irradiation. The in vitro bioassay demonstrated 52% cell death of U-251MG derived from human malignant glioblastoma multiforme at a concentration of 1 $\mu$M RB after illumination and irradiation (2 Gy, 320 kV, 10 mA, 3 Gy/min at 47 cm). In addition, the RB-coupled NRP-1-targeting peptide (i.e., K(RB)DKPPR) was conjugated onto AGuIX NPs by a thiol-maleimide click chemistry reaction, and an affinity in the nM range was observed.

Title: Rotational Jamming of Optical Matter Driven by Chiral Light
Authors: Ashutosh Shukla, Sneha Boby, Rahul Chand, G. V. Pavan Kumar
Abstract: Optical matter (OM), composed of optically bound metallic particles, can be rotated by transferring the spin angular momentum (SAM) of chiral light to the assembly. Rotating OM is a promising platform for optical micromachines, with potential applications in plasmofluidics and soft robotics. Understanding the dynamic states of such Brownian, micro-mechanical systems is a relevant issue. One key problem is understanding kinetic jamming and clogging. Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the structural symmetry of the OM assembly and its ability to harness SAM, providing new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and offering a novel platform for studying jamming transitions.

Title: M3Scope a 3D multimode multiplane microscope for imaging nanoscale dynamics in soft matter
Authors: Steven Huysecom, Francisco Bevilacqua, Roger Bresoli Obach, Sudipta Seth, Luis M. Liz-Marzan, Dagmar R. D hooge, Johan Hofkens, Susana Rocha, Boris Louis
Abstract: Fast, volumetric imaging that integrates multiple imaging modalities is essential for probing dynamic, heterogeneous soft and biological matter. Here, we present the M3Scope, a simple yet versatile multiplane microscope that extends widefield detection with a modular multimode cube to enable dual color fluorescence, polarization-resolved, and correlative brightfield fluorescence imaging while (i) preserving simultaneous 3D acquisition at high frame rates (100 fps) and (ii) requiring minimal realignment. We demonstrate its potential by investigating polymer dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales. In an acrylamide type polymerizing network, dual color tracking of 100 nm and 300 nm fluorescent probes revealed size dependent viscosities diverging from 15 mPa.s to 40 mPa.s after gelation. Polarization resolved rotational tracking of gold bipyramids yielded viscosities within 10 percent of theoretical values in 80 to 95 percent glycerol and remained accurate in the high-viscosity regime (bigger than 400 mPa.s) where translational motion is undetectable. Fluorescence brightfield imaging correlated structural changes during poly(isopropyl acrylamide) (pNIPAM) phase separation as well as variations in tracer diffusivity, linking morphology and dynamics in 3D. Taken together, these results show that the M3Scope delivers high speed volumetric imaging with flexible modality switching, providing a powerful platform for studying dynamic, heterogeneous systems across disciplines, from polymer physics to cell mechanobiology.

Title: Continuum limit of gauged tensor network states
Authors: Gertian Roose, Erez Zohar
Abstract: It is well known that all physically relevant states of gauge theories lie in the sectors of the Hilbert space which satisfy the Gauss law. On the lattice, the manifeslty gauge invariant subspace is known to be exactly spanned by gauged tensor networks. In this work, we demonstrate that the continuum limit of certain types of gauged tensor networks is well defined and leads to a new class of states that may be helpful for the non-perturbative study of gauge theories directly in the continuum.

Title: Work distribution and fluctuation theorem in AdS/CFT
Authors: Daichi Takeda
Abstract: From the AdS/CFT dictionary, we derive a bulk dual of the work distribution defined by the two-point measurement on the boundary, yielding a bulk formulation of the Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem. We argue that this not only provides a holographic prescription of the work distribution, but is also expected to capture some "mesoscopic" aspects of quantum gravity.

Title: Phase field modelling of cracking and capacity fade in core-shell cathode particles for lithium-ion batteries
Authors: Y. Tu, B. Wu, E. Martínez-Pañeda
Abstract: Core-shell electrode particles are a promising morphology control strategy for high-performance lithium-ion batteries. However, experimental observations reveal that these structures remain prone to mechanical failure, with shell fractures and core-shell debonding occurring after a single charge. In this work, we present a novel, comprehensive computational framework to predict and gain insight into the failure of core-shell morphologies and the associated degradation in battery performance. The fully coupled chemo-mechano-damage model presented captures the interplay between mechanical damage and electrochemical behaviours, enabling the quantification of particle cracking and capacity fade. Both bulk material fracture and interface debonding are captured by utilising the phase field method. We quantify the severity of particle cracking and capacity loss through case studies on a representative core-shell system (NMC811@NMC532). The results bring valuable insights into cracking patterns, underlying mechanisms, and their impact on capacity loss. Surface cracks are found to initiate when a significantly higher lithium concentration accumulates in the core compared to the shell. Interfacial debonding is shown to arise from localised hoop stresses near the core-shell interface, due to greater shell expansion. This debonding develops rapidly, impedes lithium-ion transport, and can lead to more than 10\% capacity loss after a single discharge. Furthermore, larger particles may experience crack branching driven by extensive tensile zones, potentially fragmenting the entire particle. The framework developed can not only bring new insight into the degradation mechanisms of core-shell particles but also be used to design electrode materials with improved performance and extended lifetime.

Title: Splitting obstructions and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants in time-reversal symmetric topological insulators
Authors: Alessandro Ferreri, Domenico Monaco, Gabriele Peluso
Abstract: The Fu-Kane-Mele $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index characterizes two-dimensional time-reversal symmetric topological phases of matter. We shed some light on some features of this index by investigating projection-valued maps endowed with a fermionic time-reversal symmetry. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we establish a decomposition theorem, proving that any such projection-valued map admits a splitting into two projection-valued maps that are related to each other via time-reversal symmetry. Second, we provide a complete homotopy classification theorem for these maps, thereby clarifying their topological structure. Third, by means of the previous analysis, we connect the Fu-Kane-Mele index to the Chern number of one of the factors in the previously-mentioned decomposition, which in turn allows to exhibit how the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued topological obstruction to constructing a periodic and smooth Bloch frame for the projection-valued map, measured by the Fu-Kane-Mele index, can be concentrated in a single pseudo-periodic Kramers pair.

Title: Frequency Spectra of Isolated Laser Pulse Envelopes
Authors: L. H. Ford, Brian Fu
Abstract: This paper will deal with isolated laser pulses, those which last for a finite time interval and whose envelope function is strictly zero outside of this interval. We numerically calculate the Fourier transform of this function and study its asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. This work is motivated by recent results on the probability distributions of quadratic operators in second quantized systems. An example is the density of a material which is subject to zero point fluctuations in the phonon vacuum state. These distributions can decrease very slowly, leading to a relatively high probability for large fluctuations. If the operator is measured by a laser pulse, the rate of decrease of the distribution mirrors the rate of decrease of the pulse envelope Fourier transform. We describe a model for the creation of isolated pulses in which this Fourier transform falls as an exponential of a fractional power of frequency and find examples where this fraction is in the range 0.1 to 0.2. The probability distribution for large fluctuation has the same functional form and implies a significant probability for fluctuations very large compared to the variance.

Title: Parallel and GPU accelerated code for phase-field and reaction-diffusion simulations
Authors: Steven A. Silber, Mikko Karttunen
Abstract: We present SymPhas 2.0, a major update of the compile-time symbolic algebra simulation framework SymPhas for phase-field and reaction-diffusion models. This release introduces significant expansions and enhancements that enable the definition of a phase-field model directly from the free-energy functional via compile-time evaluated functional differentiation. It also introduces directional derivatives, symbolic summation, tensor-valued expressions, and compile-time derived finite difference stencils of arbitrary order and accuracy. Furthermore, the code has been parallelized for CPUs with MPI, and GPU computing has been added using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). For the latter, symbolic expressions are compiled into optimized CUDA kernels, allowing large-scale simulations to execute entirely on the GPU. For large systems ($32,768^2$ in 2D and $1,024^3$ in 3D with double precision), speedups up to $\sim \!\!1,000 \times$ were obtained compared to the first version of SymPhas using multi-threaded CPU execution on a single system. These developments establish SymPhas 2.0 as a flexible and scalable framework for efficient implementation of phase-field and reaction-diffusion models on GPU-based high-performance computing platforms.

Title: Maximizing Efficiency of Dataset Compression for Machine Learning Potentials With Information Theory
Authors: Benjamin Yu, Vincenzo Lordi, Daniel Schwalbe-Koda
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) balance high accuracy and lower costs compared to density functional theory calculations, but their performance often depends on the size and diversity of training datasets. Large datasets improve model accuracy and generalization but are computationally expensive to produce and train on, while smaller datasets risk discarding rare but important atomic environments and compromising MLIP accuracy/reliability. Here, we develop an information-theoretical framework to quantify the efficiency of dataset compression methods and propose an algorithm that maximizes this efficiency. By framing atomistic dataset compression as an instance of the minimum set cover (MSC) problem over atom-centered environments, our method identifies the smallest subset of structures that contains as much information as possible from the original dataset while pruning redundant information. The approach is extensively demonstrated on the GAP-20 and TM23 datasets, and validated on 64 varied datasets from the ColabFit repository. Across all cases, MSC consistently retains outliers, preserves dataset diversity, and reproduces the long-tail distributions of forces even at high compression rates, outperforming other subsampling methods. Furthermore, MLIPs trained on MSC-compressed datasets exhibit reduced error for out-of-distribution data even in low-data regimes. We explain these results using an outlier analysis and show that such quantitative conclusions could not be achieved with conventional dimensionality reduction methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source QUESTS package and can be used for several tasks in atomistic modeling, from data subsampling, outlier detection, and training improved MLIPs at a lower cost.

Title: Broadband ultrafast self-heterodyned chiro-optical spectroscopy

Abstract: Ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy provides unique access to the structural dynamics of molecules, spin-valley relaxation in semiconductors, and the non-equilibrium optical response of chiral nanophotonic systems. Yet, because chiral signals are intrinsically weak and time-resolved spectroscopy probes small photoinduced changes, transient chiro-optical responses are often difficult to isolate from parasitic achiral contributions. Here, we introduce a broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy technique that integrates a birefringent common-path interferometer with an optical polarization bridge to sensitively detect photoinduced changes in the polarization state of light. Phase-sensitive self-heterodyned detection enables simultaneous measurement of transient circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion across a broad spectral range with ultrafast temporal resolution. Balanced detection suppresses excess laser noise, enabling exceptional sensitivity (<50 ${\mu}$deg) close to shot-noise limit. We demonstrate this approach on an array of gold nano-helicoids, supported by a full-wave time-resolved model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of plasmonic non-equilibrium carriers and their associated optical nonlinearities. The model traces the system's transient chiro-optical response back to photoinduced modulations of the electric-magnetic dipole interaction in the nano-helicoid, elucidating the connection of near- and far-field dynamics in the non-equilibrium regime. We further investigate spin excitation, thermalization, and relaxation in a lead halide perovskite, establishing a novel approach to broadband time-resolved Faraday rotation. The simplicity, sensitivity, and wide applicability of this detection scheme provide a powerful platform for broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy, opening new opportunities in biochemistry, solid-state physics, and nanophotonics.

Title: Information phases of partial projected ensembles generated from random quantum states
Authors: Alan Sherry, Saptarshi Mandal, Sthitadhi Roy
Abstract: The projected ensemble -- an ensemble of pure states on a subsystem conditioned on projective measurement outcomes on its complement -- provides a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure than the reduced density matrix of the subsystem in bipartite quantum states. This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. Finally, we contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures.

Title: Novel design strategies for modulating conductive stretchable system response based on periodic assemblies
Authors: Louis Martin-Monier, Pierre-Luc Piveteau, Fabien Sorin
Abstract: Soft electronics have recently gathered considerable interest thanks to their bio-mechanical compatibility. An important feature of such deformable conductors is their electrical response to strain. While development of stretchable materials with high gauge factors has attracted considerable attention, there is a growing need for stretchable conductors whose response to deformation can be accurately engineered to provide arbitrary resistance-strain relationships. The rare studies addressing this issue have focused on deterministic geometries of single rigid materials, limiting the scope of such strategies. Herein, we introduce the novel concept of periodic stretchable patterns combining multiple conductive materials to produce tailored responses. Using shortest-path algorithms, we establish a computationally efficient selection method to obtain required resistance-strain relationship. Using this algorithm, we identify and experimentally demonstrate constant resistance-strain responses up to 50% elongation using a single micro-textured material. Finally, we demonstrate counter-intuitive sinusoidal responses by integrating three materials, with interesting applications in sensing and soft robotics.

Title: Strongly correlated physics in organic open-shell quantum systems
Authors: G. Gandus, A. Jayaraj, D. Passerone, R. Stadler, M. Luisier, A. Valli
Abstract: Strongly correlated physics arises from electron-electron scattering within partially filled orbitals. Organic molecules in open-shell configurations are therefore good candidates to exhibit many-body effects. We focus on electron transport in a two-terminal single-molecule junction setup, in which the molecular bridge consists of an organic radical with a molecular orbital hosting a single unpaired electron (SOMO). We perform beyond state-of-the-art numerical simulations combining an ab-initio description of the chemical environment, with quantum field-theoretical techniques that account for many-body effects. The key observation is that the SOMO resonance is prone to splitting and we identify a giant electronic scattering rate as the driving many-body mechanism, akin to that of the Mott metal-to-insulator transition. By comparing linear and cyclic radicals, we show that the spatial distribution of the SOMO and its projection on the molecular backbone have dramatic consequences for the transport properties of the junction. We argue that the phenomenon and the underlying microscopic mechanism apply to a broad family of open-shell molecular systems, and can explain puzzling experimental observations such as suppressed conductance in radical junctions.

Here, we revisit this phenomenon in topologically trivial Al-InSb nanosheet Josephson junctions under microwave irradiation. The missing first Shapiro step coincides with a sharp voltage jump during superconducting switching, yet reappears when the jump is lowered and softened by increasing microwave power, temperature, or magnetic field. It also reappears at higher microwave frequencies, consistent with qualitative results from an RSJ model incorporating the sharp jump. These observations indicate that the absence of the first Shapiro step, associated with the sharp switching jump, simply results from their location within the measurement blind region. This work identifies a common but overlooked mechanism underlying the missing first Shapiro step, offering new insights into fractional Josephson effect experiments.

Title: LeapFrog: Getting the Jump on Multi-Scale Materials Simulations Using Machine Learning
Authors: Damien Pinto, Michael Greenwood, Nikolas Provatas
Abstract: The development of novel materials in recent years has been accelerated greatly by the use of computational modelling techniques aimed at elucidating the complex physics controlling microstructure formation in materials, the properties of which control material function. One such technique is the phase field method, a field theoretic approach that couples various thermophysical fields to microscopic order parameter fields that track the phases of microstructure. Phase field models are framed as multiple, non-linear, partial differential equations, which are extremely challenging to compute efficiently. Recent years have seen an explosion of computational algorithms aimed at enhancing the efficiency of phase field simulations. One such technique, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), dynamically adapts numerical meshes to be highly refined around steep spatial gradients of the PDE fields and coarser where the fields are smooth. This reduces the number of computations per time step significantly, thus reducing the total time of computation. What AMR doesn't do is allow for adaptive time stepping. This work combines AMR with a neural network algorithm that uses a U-Net with a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (CLSTM) base to accelerate phase field simulations. Our neural network algorithm is described in detail and tested in on simulations of directional solidification of a dilute binary alloy, a paradigm that is highly practical for its relevance to the solidification of alloys.

Title: Inferring Higher-Order Couplings with Neural Networks
Authors: Aurélien Decelle, Alfonso de Jesús Navas Gómez, Beatriz Seoane
Abstract: Maximum entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical physics, are widely used to model pairwise interactions in complex systems across disciplines such as bioinformatics and neuroscience. While successful, these approaches often fail to capture higher-order interactions that are critical for understanding collective behavior. In contrast, modern machine learning methods can model such interactions, but their interpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations, made tractable by the RBM's structure, we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body interactions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact maps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling higher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.

Title: Non-commutative effective field theory of the lowest Landau level superfluid
Authors: Nandagopal Manoj
Abstract: A 2+1D superfluid in a rapidly rotating trap forms an array of vortices, with collective excitations called Tkachenko modes. Du et al. (2024) argued from an effective field theory viewpoint that these excitations are described by a field theory living on a non-commutative space. We elucidate the microscopic origin of these non-commutative fields, and present a novel derivation of the effective field theory for this superfluid using a lowest Landau level projected coherent state path integral approach. Besides conceptual clarity, this approach makes quantitative predictions about the long-wavelength, low-energy behavior in terms of the microscopic parameters of the short-range interacting lowest Landau level superfluid -- relevant to trapped Bose-Einstein condensate experiments.

Title: Critical Motility-Induced Phase Separation in Three Dimensions is Consistent with Ising Universality
Authors: Jiechao Feng, Daniel Evans, Ahmad K. Omar
Abstract: Identifying the universality class of critical active phase transitions has been the subject of recent interest and controversy. Resolving these controversies will require robust numerical investigations to determine whether active critical exponents point to novel universality classes or are consistent with established ones. Here, we conduct large-scale computer simulations and a finite-size scaling analysis of the motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) of active Brownian hard spheres in three dimensions (3D), finding that the static and dynamic critical exponents all closely match those of the 3D Ising universality class with a conserved scalar order parameter. This finding is corroborated by a fluctuating hydrodynamic description of the critical dynamics of the order parameter field which flows to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in three dimensions. Our work suggests that 3D MIPS and likely the entire phase diagram of active Brownian hard spheres is similar to that of molecular passive fluids despite the absence of Boltzmann statistics.

Title: Extended $s$-wave pairing from an emergent Feshbach resonance in bilayer nickelate superconductors
Authors: Pietro Borchia, Hannah Lange, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: Since the discovery of unconventional superconductivity in cuprates, unraveling the pairing mechanism of charge carriers in doped antiferromagnets has been a long-standing challenge. Motivated by the discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in nickelate bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO), we study a minimal mixed dimensional (MixD) $t-J$ model supplemented with a repulsive Coulomb interaction $V$. When hole-doped, previous numerical simulations revealed that the system exhibits strong binding energies, with a phenomenology resembling a BCS-to-BEC crossover accompanied by a Feshbach resonance between two distinct types of charge carriers. Here, we perform a mean-field analysis that enables a direct observation of the BCS-to-BEC crossover as well as microscopic insights into the crossover region and the pairing symmetry for two-dimensional bilayers. We benchmark our mean-field description by comparing it to density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations in quasi-one dimensional settings and find remarkably good agreement. For the two-dimensional system relevant to LNO our mean-field calculations predict a BCS pairing gap with an extended $s$-wave symmetry, directly resulting from the pairing mechanism's Feshbach-origin. Our analysis hence gives insights into pairing in unconventional superconductors and, further, can be tested in currently available ultracold atom experiments.

Title: Berry connection and quantum geometry in time-dependent systems with instantaneous quantum integrable field theory
Authors: Xiao Wang, Xiaodong He, Jianda Wu
Abstract: We study many-body quantum geometric effects in time-dependent system with emergent quantum integrable field theory instantaneously. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the system can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two particles from the initial quantum integrable system. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze an Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined,where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhibits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. As the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling. Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.

Abstract: Sorting, filtering, moving and controlling colloidal particles is crucial in many fields, ranging from chemistry to biology and physics. Dielectrophoresis is an outstanding tool for the manipulation of small particles by AC electric fields, due to its high selectivity and the absence of the need for labels. We use a new theoretical-experimental approach to study the dynamics of fluorescently labeled polystyrene nanoparticles of 200 nm under positive and negative dielectrophoresis conditions. Our multiplane widefield microscopy technique combined with single particle tracking offers real-time ($>$ 100 fps) superresolved visualization of colloidal dynamics in three spatial dimensions. This real-time 3D imaging technique allows the reconstruction of superresolved trajectories, enabling the visualisation of local forces with unprecedented detail. To interpret this data, a dedicated multiscale modeling approach was developed, targeting a direct comparison between theory and experiment. In the current model DEP and electro-osmotic forces were considered. Under positive DEP conditions, this resulted in a very good agreement with experiment. Under negative DEP conditions, the agreement is less clear, indicating the importance of other effects. This illustrates the potential of this combined 3D imaging and modeling approach to validate and refine our theoretical understanding of AC field induced colloidal dynamics. This framework is broadly applicable to other complex fluid or microfluidic motion.

Title: Emergent fractals in dirty topological crystals
Authors: Daniel J. Salib, Bitan Roy
Abstract: Non-trivial geometry of electronic Bloch states gives rise to topological insulators which are robust against sufficiently weak randomness inevitably present in any quantum material. However, increasing disorder triggers a quantum phase transition into a featureless normal insulator. As the underlying quantum critical point is approached from the topological side, small scattered droplets of normal insulators start to develop in the system and their coherent nucleation causes ultimate condensation into a trivial insulator. Unless disorder is too strong, the normal insulator accommodates disjoint tiny topological puddles. Furthermore, in the close vicinity of such a transition the emergent islands of topological and trivial insulators display spatial fractal structures, a feature that is revealed only by local topological markers. Here we showcase this (possibly) generic phenomenon that should be apposite to dirty topological crystals of any symmetry class in any dimension from the Bott index and local Chern marker for a square-lattice-based disordered Chern insulator model.

Title: The structural effects of (111) growth of La2CoMnO6 on SrTiO3 and LSAT -- new insights from 3D crystallographic characterisation with 4D-STEM and Digital Dark Field imaging
Authors: Ian MacLaren, Andrew T. Fraser, Matthew R. Lipsett
Abstract: The 3-dimensional orientation of La atom modulations has been mapped in two thin films of La2CoMnO6 grown on SrTiO3 and LSAT ([La,Sr,Al,Ta] oxide) using a 4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) method based on the recently developed Digital Dark Field method. This images the shifts of diffraction spots and the azimuthal intensity distribution in the First Order Laue Zone, and then uses them to reconstruct and map the 3D crystallography. This clearly shows a flip from out-of-plane modulation with tensile strain on SrTiO3 to in-plane modulation with compressive strain on LSAT. This hitherto unobserved crystallographic change had a significant influence on the out-of-plane lattice parameter which left more room for the full incorporation of the larger CoO6 octahedra in the film grown on LSAT and therefore explained the improved Mn-Co ordering and better properties for this film. Moreover, the method would be applicable to many other systems of epitaxial growth of complex oxides, revealing crystallographic details of crucial importance to properties which are not visible in conventional atomic resolution imaging.

Title: Engineering stacking-induced topological phase transitions in bilayer heterostructures
Authors: Arjyama Bordoloi, Daniel Kaplan, Sobhit Singh
Abstract: Nonmagnetic topological insulators (TIs) are known for their robust metallic surface/edge states that are protected by time-reversal symmetry, making them promising candidates for next-generation spintronic and nanoelectronic devices. Traditional approaches to realizing TIs have focused on inducing band inversion via strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), yet many materials with substantial SOC often remain topologically trivial. In this work, we present a materials-design strategy for engineering topologically non-trivial phases, e.g., quantum spin Hall phases, by vertically stacking topologically trivial Rashba monolayers in an inverted fashion. Using BiSb as a prototype system, we demonstrate that while the BiSb monolayer is topologically trivial (despite having significant SOC), an inverted BiSb-SbBi bilayer configuration realizes a non-trivial topological phase with enhanced spin Hall conductivity. We further reveal a delicate interplay between the SOC strength and the interlayer electron tunneling that governs the emergence of a nontrivial topological phase in the bilayer heterostructure. This phase can be systematically tuned using an external electric field, providing an experimentally accessible means of controlling the system's topology. Our magnetotransport studies further validate this interplay, by revealing $g$-factor suppression and the emergence a zeroth Landau level. Notably, the inverted bilayer heterostructure exhibits a robust and tunable spin Hall effect, with performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art materials. Thus, our findings unveil an alternative pathway for designing and engineering functional properties in 2D topological systems using topologically trivial constituent monolayers.

Title: Nonmonotonic diffusion in sheared active suspensions of squirmers
Authors: Zhouyang Ge, John F. Brady, Gwynn J. Elfring
Abstract: We investigate how shear influences the dynamics of active particles in dilute to concentrated suspensions. Using apolar active suspensions of squirmers as model systems, we show how their long-time diffusive dynamics can surprisingly slow down and vary nonmonotonically with the shear rate arising from an interplay between the activity-induced persistent motion and shear-induced reorientation and diffusion. Further simulations of self-propelled particles with tunable persistence exhibit richer dynamics and confirm the observed coupling, suggesting that nonmonotonic diffusion may be a general feature of fluids endowed with an underlying microstructure and large persistence. Our results reveal a nonlinear effect of shear on diffusion in active suspensions, elucidate how internal and external forcing interact, and provide new possibilities to modulate transport in active fluids.

Title: Pair binding and Hund's rule breaking in high-symmetry fullerenes
Authors: R. Rausch, C. Karrasch
Abstract: Highly-symmetric molecules often exhibit degenerate tight-binding states at the Fermi edge. This typically results in a magnetic ground state if small interactions are introduced in accordance with Hund's rule. In some cases, Hund's rule may be broken, which signals pair binding and goes hand-in-hand with an attractive pair-binding energy. We investigate pair binding and Hund's rule breaking for the Hubbard model on high-symmetry fullerenes C$_{20}$, C$_{28}$, C$_{40}$, and C$_{60}$ by using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations. We exploit the SU(2) spin symmetry, the U(1) charge symmetry, and optionally the Z(N) spatial rotation symmetry of the problem. For C$_{20}$, our results agree well with available exact-diagonalization data, but our approach is numerically much cheaper. We find a Mott transition at $U_c\sim2.2t$, which is much smaller than the previously reported value of $U_c\sim4.1t$ that was extrapolated from a few datapoints. We compute the pair-binding energy for arbitrary values of $U$ and observe that it remains overall repulsive. For larger fullerenes, we are not able to evaluate the pair binding energy with sufficient precision, but we can still investigate Hund's rule breaking. For C$_{28}$, we find that Hund's rule is fulfilled with a magnetic spin-2 ground state that transitions to a spin-1 state at $U_{c,1}\sim5.4t$ before the eventual Mott transition to a spin singlet takes place at $U_{c,2}\sim 11.6t$. For C$_{40}$, Hund's rule is broken in the singlet ground state, but is restored if the system is doped with one electron. Hund's rule is also broken for C$_{60}$, and the doping with two or three electrons results in a minimum-spin state. Our results are consistent with an electronic mechanism of superconductivity for C$_{60}$ lattices. We speculate that the high geometric frustration of small fullerenes is detrimental to pair binding.

Title: Magnon thermal Hall effect in collinear ferrimagnets
Authors: Vladimir A. Zyuzin
Abstract: In this paper we theoretically discuss thermal Hall effect of magnons in insulating Néel ordered antiferromagnets at zero external magnetic field. We show that for compensated Néel order the non-zero thermal Hall effect will occur inthe absence of any symmetry between the two magnetic sublattices, thus making the system ferrimagnetic. The thermal Hall effect of magnons will be non-zero by a virtue of the spin-momentum splitting of the magnon spectrum due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as well as anisotropic second-nearest exchange interaction different in the two magnetic sublattices, both corresponding to the broken symmetry. We construct a theoretical model in which an external electric field may change the symmetry of the antiferromagnetic system thus altering the thermal Hall effect of magnons.

Title: Enantiosensitive molecular compass
Authors: Philip Caesar M. Flores, Stefanos Carlström, Serguei Patchkovskii, Misha Ivanov, Vladimiro Mujica, Andres F. Ordonez, Olga Smirnova
Abstract: Chirality describes the asymmetry between an object and its mirror image and manifests itself in diverse functionalities across all scales of matter - from molecules and aggregates to thin films and bulk chiral materials. A particularly intriguing example is chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where chiral structures orient electron spins enantio-sensitively. Despite extensive research, the fundamental origin of spin-chirality coupling, the unexpectedly large magnitude of the CISS effect, and the possible role of electromagnetic fields in it remain unclear. Here, we address these issues by examining the simplest scenario: spin-resolved photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We uncover a universal mechanism of spin-selective chiral photodynamics, arising solely from electric-dipole interactions and previously unrecognized. This mechanism embodies a chiral molecular compass - a photoinduced magnetization vector that orients the photoelectron spin. It arises in photoexcited chiral molecules even under isotropic illumination, operates even in isotropic chiral media, and enables a phenomenon central to CISS: locking of the photoelectron spin orientation to molecular geometry. It shows that chiral molecules can sustain time-odd correlations whereas achiral molecules cannot. Our findings have broad implications, from unambiguously identifying the origin of CISS effect in photoionization to harvesting correlations underlying this effect in other forms of CISS in various chiral materials.

Title: More sophisticated is not always better: comparison of similarity measures for unsupervised learning of pathways in biomolecular simulations
Authors: Miriam Jäger, Steffen Wolf
Abstract: Finding process pathways in molecular simulations such as the unbinding paths of small molecule ligands from their binding sites at protein targets in a set of trajectories via unsupervised learning approaches requires the definition of a suitable similarity measure between trajectories. We here evaluate the performance of four such measures with varying degree of sophistication, i.e., Euclidean and Wasserstein distances, Procrustes analysis and dynamical time warping, when analyzing trajectory data from two different biased simulation driving protocols in the form of constant velocity constraint targeted MD and steered MD. In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures. In a more complex A2a receptor-inhibitor system, however, the simplest measure, i.e., Euclidean distances, was sufficient to reveal meaningful and interpretable clusters.

Title: Quantum Kinetic Anatomy of Electron Angular Momenta Edge Accumulation
Authors: T. Valet, H. Jaffres, V. Cros, R. Raimondi
Abstract: Controlling electron's spin and orbital degrees of freedom has been a major research focus over the past two decades, as it underpins the electrical manipulation of magnetization. Leveraging a recently introduced quantum kinetic theory of multiband systems [T. Valet and R. Raimondi, Phys. Rev. B 111, L041118 (2025)], we outline how the intrinsic angular momenta linear response is partitioned into intraband and interband contributions. Focusing on time reversal and inversion symmetric metals, we show that the spin and orbital Hall currents are purely intraband. We also reveal that the intrinsic edge densities originate partially, and in the orbital case probably mostly, from a new interband mechanism. We discuss how this profoundly impacts the interpretation of orbital edge accumulation observations, and has broader implications for current induced torques.

Specht, Penghui Cao, Wen Chen, Yogesh K. Vohra, Leora Dresselhaus-Marais
Abstract: High entropy alloys (HEAs) are a new class of metals that exhibit unique mechanical performance. Among HEAs, additively manufactured eutectic high entropy alloys (AM-EHEAs) have recently emerged as candidate materials for use in extreme conditions due to their simultaneous high strength and ductility. However, the deformation and structural evolution of AM-EHEAs under conditions of high pressure have not been well characterized, limiting their use in extreme applications. We present dynamic compression experiments and molecular dynamics simulations studying the structural evolution of AM-EHEA AlCoCrFeNi2.1 when compressed to pressures up to 400 GPa. Our in-situ X-ray diffraction measurements capture the appearance of fcc and bcc phases at different pressure conditions, with pure- and mixed-phase regions. Understanding the phase stability and structural evolution of the AM EHEA offers new insights to guide the development of high-performance complex materials for extreme conditions.

Title: Energy Underprediction from Symmetry in Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Wei Nong, Ruiming Zhu, Zekun Ren, Martin Hoffmann Petersen, Shuya Yamazaki, Nikita Kazeev, Andrey Ustyuzhanin, Gang Wu, Shuo-Wang Yang, Kedar Hippalgaonkar
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIAPs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating materials simulations with near-density functional theory (DFT) accuracy. However, despite significant advances, we identify a critical yet overlooked issue undermining their reliability: a systematic energy underprediction. This problem becomes starkly evident in large-scale thermodynamic stability assessments. By performing over 12 million calculations using nine MLIAPs for over 150,000 inorganic crystals in the Materials Project, we demonstrate that most frontier models consistently underpredict energy above hull (Ehull), a key metric for thermodynamic stability, total energy, and formation energy, despite the fact that over 90\% of test structures (DFT-relaxed) are in the training data. The mean absolute errors (MAE) for Ehull exceed ~30 meV/atom even by the best model, directly challenging claims of achieving ``DFT accuracy'' for property predictions central to materials discovery, especially related to (meta-)stability. Crucially, we trace this underprediction to insufficient handling of symmetry degrees of freedom (DOF), constituting both lattice symmetry and Wyckoff site symmetries for the space group. MLIAPs exhibit pronounced errors (MAE for Ehull $>$ ~40 meV/atom) in structures with high symmetry DOF, where subtle atomic displacements significantly impact energy landscapes. Further analysis also indicates that the MLIAPs show severe energy underprediction for a large proportion of near-hull materials. We argue for improvements on symmetry-aware models such as explicit DOF encoding or symmetry-regularized loss functions, and more robust MLIAPs for predicting crystal properties where the preservation and breaking of symmetry are pivotal.

Title: pH-dependent interfacial rheology of polymer membranes assembled at liquid-liquid interfaces using hydrogen bonds
Authors: Julien Dupré de Baubigny (SIMM), Corentin Tregouet (SIMM), Elena N. Govorun, Mathilde Reyssat, Patrick Perrin (SIMM), Nadège Pantoustier (SIMM), Thomas Salez (LOMA), Cécile Monteux (SIMM)
Abstract: Self-assembly of polymers at liquid interfaces using non-covalent interactions has emerged as a promising technique to reversibly produce self-healing membranes. Besides the assembly process, it is also crucial to control the mechanical properties of these membranes. Here, we measure the interfacial rheological properties of PMAA-PPO (polymethacrylic acid - polypropylene oxide) polymer membranes assembled using hydrogen bonds at the interface between water and a polar oil, Mygliol. Varying the pH enables us to modify the degree of ionization of the PMAA chains, and hence their ability to establish hydrogen interactions with PPO. Frequency sweeps of the interfacial layers show a crossover between a viscous regime at low frequencies and an elastic regime at high frequencies. The crossover elastic modulus, measured one hour after the two phases were put into contact, decreases by a half over the pH range investigated, which can be accounted for by a decrease of the layer thickness as pH increases. Furthermore, we find that the crossover frequency varies exponentially with the degree of ionization of PMAA. To account for these observations, we propose a simple picture where the short PPO chains behave as non-covalent cross-linkers that bridge several PMAA chains. The dissociation rate and hence the crossover frequency are controlled by the number of PO units per PPO chain involved in the hydrogen bonds.

Title: A Gross-Pitaevskii theory for an excitonic incompressible Bose solid
Authors: Sara Conti, Andrey Chaves, Alexander R. Hamilton, Jacques Tempere, Milorad V. Milosevic, David Neilson
Abstract: We show that interlayer excitons in double-layer semiconductor heterostructures can form a Bose solid, which is an incompressible supersolid characterized by exactly one boson per lattice site. This exciton Bose solid would be the first realization of an incompressible supersolid, unlike the generally compressible cluster supersolids seen in dipolar quantum gases. Capturing its characteristics and associated emergent phenomena requires extending the Gross-Pitaevskii formalism to include strong two-particle correlations and exclude exciton self-interactions. We develop such a formalism, we apply it across experimentally accessible exciton densities and interlayer separations, and we show that it incorporates both superfluid and incompressible supersolid ground states. This extended framework allows us to determine the superfluid-supersolid transition and explore the low-temperature properties of the exciton supersolid across its complete parameter space.

Title: Characterizing local Majorana properties using Andreev states
Authors: Miguel Alvarado, Alfredo Levy Yetati, Ramón Aguado, Rubén Seoane Souto
Abstract: We propose using Andreev bound states (ABS) as spectroscopic probes to characterize Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in quantum-dot based minimal Kitaev chains. Specifically, we show that tunneling conductance measurements with a superconducting probe hosting an ABS reveal four subgap peaks whose voltage positions and relative heights enable extraction of the MZM energy splitting and Bogoliubov-de Gennes coherence factors. This provides direct access to zero-splitting regimes and to the local Majorana polarization - a measure of the Majorana character. The method is compatible with existing experimental architectures and remains robust in extended chains.

Title: Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks
Authors: F. Gallavotti, A. Zaccone
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.

Title: Longitudinal magnons in large-$S$ easy-axis magnets
Authors: A. El Mendili, T. Ziman, M. E. Zhitomirsky
Abstract: Longitudinal magnons are a distinct type of multipolar excitations in magnetic materials with large spins $S\ge 1$ and strong easy-axis anisotropy. These excitations have angular momentum $S^z = \pm 2S$ and can be viewed as a propagating full spin reversal. We study longitudinal magnons for the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg ferromagnet and antiferromagnet on a square lattice with large single-ion anisotropy. In the strong-coupling limit, we derive an effective spin-1/2 model including two leading contributions in $J/D$. The effective model provides a simple description of the longitudinal magnon dynamics. For $S=1$, we compare results from several theoretical approaches that include the effective spin-1/2 model, the linked-cluster expansion, the multiboson spin-wave theory, and, for a ferromagnet, an exact two-particle solution. Among these approaches, the multiboson spin-wave theory provides the decay rate of longitudinal magnons and describes evolution of the excitation spectra from strong to weak anisotropy.

Title: Rolling at right angles: magnetic anisotropy enables dual-anisotropic active matter
Authors: Eavan Fitzgerald, Cécile Clavaud, Debasish Das, Isaac C.D. Lenton, Scott R. Waitukaitis
Abstract: We report on an experimental active matter system with motion restricted to four cardinal directions. Our particles are magnetite-doped colloidal spheres driven by the Quincke electrorotational instability. The absence of a magnetic field ($|\bm{B}|=0$) leads to circular trajectories interspersed with short spontaneous runs. Intermediate fields ($|\bm{B}| \lesssim 20$ mT) linearize the motion along the axis perpendicular to $\bm{B}$. At high magnetic fields, we observe the surprising emergence of a second, distinct linearization along the axis parallel to $\bm{B}$. With numerical simulations, we show that this behavior can be explained by anisotropic magnetic susceptibility.

Title: The effect of multi-occupancy traps on the diffusion and retention of multiple hydrogen isotopes in irradiated tungsten and vanadium
Authors: Sanjeet Kaur, Daniel R. Mason, Prashanth Srinivasan, Stephen Dixon, Sid Mungale, Teresa Orr, Mikhail Yu. Lavrentiev, Duc Nguyen-Manh
Abstract: We propose a computational scheme for the diffusion and retention of multiple hydrogen isotopes (HI) with multi-occupancy traps parameterized by first principles calculations. We show that it is often acceptable to reduce the complexity of the coupled differential equations for gas evolution by taking the dynamic steady state, a generalisation of the Oriani equilibrium for multiple isotopes and multi-occupancy traps. The effective gas diffusivity varies most with mobile fraction when the total gas concentration approximates the trap density. We show HI binding to a monovacancy in vanadium produces a non-monotonic dependence between diffusivity and gas concentration, unlike the tungsten system. We demonstrate the difference between multiple single occupancy traps and multi-occupancy traps in long-term diffusion dynamics. The applicability of the multi-occupancy, multi-isotope model in steady state is assessed by comparison to an isotope exchange experiment between hydrogen and deuterium in self-ion irradiated tungsten. The vacancy distribution is estimated with molecular dynamics, and the retention across sample depth shows good agreement with experiment using no fitting parameters.

Title: Terahertz third-harmonic generation of lightwave driven Weyl fermions far from equilibrium
Authors: Patrick Pilch, Changqing Zhu, Sergey Kovalev, Renato M. A. Dantas, Amilcar Bedoya-Pinto, Stuart S. P. Parkin, Zhe Wang
Abstract: We report on time-resolved ultrafast terahertz third-harmonic generation spectroscopy of nonequilibrium dynamics of Weyl fermions in a nanometer thin film of the Weyl semimetal TaP. Terahertz third-harmonic generation is observed at room temperature under the drive of a multicycle narrowband terahertz pulse with a peak field strength of down to tens of kV/cm. The observed terahertz third-harmonic generation exhibits a perturbative cubic power-law dependence on the terahertz drive. By varying the polarization of the drive pulse from linear to elliptical, we realize a sensitive tuning of the third harmonic yield. By carrying out theoretical analysis based on the Boltzmann transport theory, we can properly describe the experimental results and ascribe the observed THz nonlinearity to field-driven kinetics of the Weyl fermions.

Title: MicroLad: 2D-to-3D Microstructure Reconstruction and Generation via Latent Diffusion and Score Distillation
Authors: Kang-Hyun Lee, Faez Ahmed
Abstract: A major obstacle to establishing reliable structure-property (SP) linkages in materials engineering is the scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets. Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies, hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion (2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data, effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation. Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural descriptors and material properties.

Title: Replicated liquid theory in $1+\infty$ dimensions
Authors: Yukihiro Tomita, Hajime Yoshino
Abstract: We develop a replicated liquid theory for structural glasses which exhibit spatial variation of physical quantities along one axis, say $z$-axis. The theory becomes exact with infinite transverse dimension $d-1 \to \infty$. It provides an exact free-energy functional with space-dependent glass order parameter $\Delta_{ab}(z)$. As a first application of the scheme, we study diverging lengths associated with dynamic/static glass transitions of hardspheres with/without confining cavity. The exponents agree with those obtained in previous studies on related mean-field models. Moreover, it predicts a non-trivial spatial profile of the glass order parameter $\Delta_{ab}(z)$ within the cavity which exhibits a scaling feature approaching the dynamical glass transition.

Title: Sub-nanosecond structural dynamics of the martensitic transformation in Ni-Mn-Ga
Authors: Yuru Ge, Fabian Ganss, Daniel Schmidt, Daniel Hensel, Mike J. Bruckhoff, Sakshath Sadashivaiah, Bruno Neumann, Mariana Brede, Markus E. Gruner, Peter Gaal, Klara Lünser, Sebastian Fähler
Abstract: Martensitic transformations drive a multitude of emerging applications, which range from high stroke actuation and, mechanocaloric refrigeration, to thermoelastic energy harvesting. All these applications benefit from faster transformations, as a high cycle frequency is essential for achieving high power density. However, systematic investigations of the fast dynamics and fundamental speed limits of martensitic transformations are scarce. Especially for ultrashort time transformations, the temperature evolution throughout the transformation is not measured, which is a substantial shortcoming as temperature is the intrinsic force driving the transformation. Here, we present a synchrotron-based time-resolved X-ray diffraction study of a 270 fs laser-induced martensitic transformation in a Ni-Mn-Ga-based epitaxial thin film. We observe the transformation from martensite to austenite within about 100 ps, just limited by the synchrotron probe pulse duration. Furthermore, a full transformation cycle from martensite to austenite and back to martensite can almost be finished within 5 ns, which is the fastest martensitic transformation reported so far. Measurements and calculations of the temperature evolution allow us to analyse the influence of temperature on transformation time. By time-resolved strain measurements we demonstrate that in addition to temperature, thermal film stress must be considered as a competing influence on the martensitic transformation. Our experimental findings are supported by molecular dynamics simulations with machine learned force fields adapted to density functional theory calculations. These reveal that the huge distortion during a martensitic transformation requires the collective movement of many atoms within the microstructure, which delays the transformation.

Title: Three-dimensional flat bands and possible interlayer triplet pairing superconductivity in the alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moiré bulk
Authors: Shuang Liu, Peng Chen, Shihao Zhang
Abstract: Moiré superlattices hosting flat bands and correlated states have emerged as a focal topic in condensed matter research. Through first-principles calculations, we investigate three-dimensional flat bands in alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moiré bulk structures. These structures exhibit enhanced interlayer interactions compared to twisted bilayer configurations. Our results demonstrate that moiré bulks undergo spontaneous large-scale structural relaxation, resulting in the formation of remarkably flat energy bands at twist angles $\leq$ 7.31°. The $k_z$-dependent dispersion of flat bands across different moiré bulks reveals their intrinsic three-dimensional character. The presence of out-of-plane mirror symmetry in these moiré bulk structures suggests possible interlayer triplet superconducting pairing mechanisms that differ from those in twisted bilayer systems. Our work paves the way for exploring potential three-dimensional flat bands in other moiré bulk systems.

Title: Interplay between Hubbard interaction and charge transfer energy in three-orbital Emery model: implication on cuprates and nickelates
Authors: Yan Peng, Mi Jiang
Abstract: We use the numerically unbiased determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to systematically investigate the three-orbital Emery model in the normal state in a wide range of local interactions, charge transfer energy, and doping levels. We focus on the influence of the onsite Hubbard $U_{dd}$ and the charge transfer energy scale $\epsilon_p$ on the electronic properties via the orbital occupancies, local moments, spin correlations, and spectral properties. Rich features of the orbital-resolved local and momentum-dependent spectra are revealed to associate with the possible Zhang-Rice singlet (ZRS) breakdown reflected by the peak splitting near the Fermi level in the heavily overdoped regime. Moreover, the pseudogap features at a small charge transfer energy scale (relevant to cuprates) are shown to diminish at larger $\epsilon_p$, which implies the weakening or absence of the pseudogap in the infinite-layer nickelates. Besides, an optimal value of $\epsilon_p$ is identified for maximizing the antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin correlations. Our large-scale simulations provide new insights on the well-established Emery model, particularly in the regime of heavily overdoped and/or large charge transfer energy scale.

Title: Are Neural Networks Collision Resistant?
Authors: Marco Benedetti, Andrej Bogdanov, Enrico M. Malatesta, Marc Mézard, Gianmarco Perrupato, Alon Rosen, Nikolaj I. Schwartzbach, Riccardo Zecchina
Abstract: When neural networks are trained to classify a dataset, one finds a set of weights from which the network produces a label for each data point. We study the algorithmic complexity of finding a collision in a single-layer neural net, where a collision is defined as two distinct sets of weights that assign the same labels to all data. For binary perceptrons with oscillating activation functions, we establish the emergence of an overlap gap property in the space of collisions. This is a topological property believed to be a barrier to the performance of efficient algorithms. The hardness is supported by numerical experiments using approximate message passing algorithms, for which the algorithms stop working well below the value predicted by our analysis. Neural networks provide a new category of candidate collision resistant functions, which for some parameter setting depart from constructions based on lattices. Beyond relevance to cryptography, our work uncovers new forms of computational hardness emerging in large neural networks which may be of independent interest.

Title: Temperature and conditions for thermalization after canonical quenches
Authors: Lennart Dabelow
Abstract: We consider quenches of a quantum system that is prepared in a canonical equilibrium state of one Hamiltonian and then evolves unitarily in time under a different Hamiltonian. Technically, our main result is a systematic expansion of the pre- and post-quench canonical ensembles in the quench strength. We first demonstrate how this can be used to predict the system's temperature after the quench from equilibrium properties at the pre-quench temperature. For a thermalizing post-quench system, it furthermore allows us to calculate equilibrium observable expectation values. Finally, in the presence of additional conserved quantities besides the Hamiltonian, we obtain a hierarchy of necessary conditions for thermalization towards the (post-quench) canonical ensemble. At first order, these thermalization conditions have a nice geometric interpretation in operator space with the canonical covariance as a semi-inner product: The quench operator (difference between post- and pre-quench Hamiltonians) and the conserved quantity must be orthogonal in the orthogonal complement of the post-quench Hamiltonian. We illustrate the results numerically for a variety of setups involving integrable and nonintegrable models.

Title: Hybrid light-matter boundaries of graphene in a chiral cavity
Authors: Volker Karle, Oriana K. Diessel, Vasil Rokaj, Ceren B. Dağ
Abstract: Recent advances in chiral cavities that can couple coherently to two-dimensional materials have opened a powerful route to reshape electronic topology without an external drive. Here we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence for graphene embedded in a circularly polarized cavity. By combining exact diagonalization (ED) of zigzag ribbons, a semi-analytic T-matrix for half-infinite lattices, and analytical insights from a Dirac-Jaynes-Cummings model, we show that (i) every light-matter interaction-induced gap hosts pairs of unidirectional light-matter edge currents depending on the Chern number of the band while some of them are even bright; (ii) these chiral states persist throughout the entire photon ladder; and (iii) their dispersion, localization length and photon distribution exhibit a universal scaling controlled by the light-matter interaction. Time-evolution simulations further demonstrate that a dark electronic edge excitation can be converted into a bright and unidirectionally propagating current that remains coherent over long time scales. Our results predict an experimental signature of the hybrid band topology and a blueprint for tunable chiral channels in next generation quantum optical solid-state devices.

Title: Financial Interactions and Collective States: Part II. Banks, Investors and Firms
Authors: Pierre Gosselin (IF), Aïleen Lotz
Abstract: In a previous paper, we applied a field formalism to analyze capital allocation and accumulation within a microeconomic framework of investors and firms. The financial connections were modeled by a field of stakes, representing the links between agents. We showed that the resulting collective states were composed of interconnected groups of agents defined by their connections, their returns and disposable capital. However, within this framework, the collective states exhibited structural instability, as capital shortages in specific sectors could trigger cascades of defaults. The present model refines this framework by introducing a third type of agent, banks, a type of investor that can create money through loans. We show that money creation neither eliminates systemic instability nor prevents the emergence of defaults. In fact, the effect of banks on system stability and defaults is ambiguous: When banks favor firms over investors, money creation stabilizes the system by providing the necessary capital to prevent initial defaults, whereas when banks favor investors over firms, investors' influence is strengthened, potentially amplifying instability and defaults. Moreover, regardless of whether they favor investors or firms, banks may facilitate the propagation of defaults once they have started. Ultimately, because banks are themselves investors, the emergence of highly capitalized, high-return banks can directly generate instability in the system. Beyond these mechanisms, the analysis reveals the structural limits of macroprudential regulation. Highly capitalized, high-return investors and banks may appear more diversified and resilient, yet they constitute the primary source of endogenous instability. The model thus highlights that systemic fragility is inherent to the very structure of financial interdependence and capital flows.

Title: Anomalous Hall effect in metallic collinear antiferromagnets
Authors: Vladimir P. Golubinskii, Vladimir A. Zyuzin
Abstract: We propose and theoretically study minimal models of Néel ordered collinear antiferromagnets exhibiting the anomalous Hall effect. For simplicity, we consider two-dimensional models of antiferromagnets with two magnetic sublattices on a square lattice. We provide explicit examples of a Néel ordered ferrimagnet and a Dzyaloshinskii weak ferromagnet. We analyze Dzyaloshinskii's invariants for the existence of spontaneous magnetization in these Néel ordered systems. As a result, we find that the anomalous Hall effect is allowed only for specific directions of the Néel order, dictated by the crystal lattice symmetries. Microscopic calculations of the Berry curvature for the studied systems confirm the validity of these Dzyaloshinskii's invariants. We show that the anomalous Hall effect mechanism in these antiferromagnets arises from the interplay of momentum-dependent exchange interaction of conducting fermions with the Néel order and the spin-orbit coupling, both originating from the broken symmetries that permit the Dzyaloshinskii's invariant in the system.

Title: Information Thermodynamics in a Quantum Dot Szilard Engine - Experimentally Investigating Fluctuation Theorems and Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations
Authors: David Barker, Sebastian Lehmann, Kimberly A. Dick, Peter Samuelsson, Ville Maisi, Patrick P. Potts
Abstract: In Szilard's engine, measurement and feedback allows to extract work from an equilibrium environment, a process otherwise forbidden by the laws of thermodynamics. Recent theoretical developments have established fluctuation theorems and thermodynamic uncertainty relations that constrain the fluctuations in Szilard's engine. These relations rely on auxiliary experimental protocols known as backward experiments. Here, we experimentally investigate the thermodynamics of Szilard's engine by implementing two distinct types of backward experiments. We verify and compare the corresponding fluctuation theorems and thermodynamic uncertainty relations associated with each protocol. Our results reveal that the entropy production inferable from measurement may serve as a more relevant quantifier of information than the widely used mutual information.

Title: Force-induced Elastic Softening and Conformational Transitions in a Polyampholyte Chain
Authors: Rakesh Palariya, Sunil P. Singh
Abstract: The mechanical response of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and polyampholyte (PA) chains is vital for understanding their biological functions and designing functional materials. We investigate the force-extension behavior of a PA chain with distinct charge sequences using molecular dynamics simulations and a theoretical approach based on the generalized random-phase approximation (GRPA). A diblock PA chain under extensional force undergoes a continuous coil-to-stretch transition at weak electrostatic coupling, which sharpens into a globule-coil-like transition at stronger coupling. The GRPA theory quantitatively captures these behaviors, including the sharp conformational transition and its dependence on electrostatic strength. Simulations reveal pronounced hysteresis during the force-extension and relaxation processes. Additionally, the elastic modulus exhibits four regimes: an initial plateau, stress stiffening, an exponential stress-softening behavior, and a stress stiffening regime. Using the theoretical model and structural input of the PA chain, we have demonstrated that the elastic modulus in the elastic softening regime decreases exponentially, $E\sim \exp(-\alpha_0 f/\Gamma_e)$, as a function of $f$, which aligns with the simulation results. The elastic response of the PA chain is further examined across different charge sequences, where both elastic softening and sharp transitions are absent at smaller block lengths. Finally, coarse-grained models of IDPs such as LAF-1 and DDX4 exhibit similar nonlinear elasticity, highlighting the universality of these mechanisms. Our results establish a fundamental link between electrostatic correlations, charge sequence, and nonlinear elasticity, bridging molecular interactions and macroscopic mechanics.

Title: User Manual for MOLSCAT, BOUND and FIELD, Version 2025.0: programs for quantum scattering properties and bound states of interacting pairs of atoms and molecules
Authors: Jeremy M. Hutson, C. Ruth Le Sueur
Abstract: MOLSCAT is a general-purpose package for performing non-reactive quantum scattering calculations for atomic and molecular collisions using coupled-channel methods. Simple atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collision types are coded internally and additional ones may be handled with plug-in routines. Plug-in routines may include external magnetic, electric or photon fields (and combinations of them). Simple interaction potentials are coded internally and more complicated ones may be handled with plug-in routines. BOUND is a general-purpose package for performing calculations of bound-state energies in weakly bound atomic and molecular systems using coupled-channel methods. It solves the same sets of coupled equations as MOLSCAT, and can use the same plug-in routines if desired, but with different boundary conditions. FIELD is a development of BOUND that locates external fields at which a bound state exists with a specified energy. One important use is to locate the positions of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonance positions in ultracold collisions. The program source code is available from this https URL

Title: Graph minor embedding can affect sampling degenerate ground states using quantum annealing
Authors: Naoki Maruyama, Masayuki Ohzeki, Kazuyuki Tanaka
Abstract: Quantum annealing, as currently implemented in hardware, cannot fairly sample all ground states. Graph minor embedding, which maps a problem to the hardware graph of quantum annealers, affects sampling all states. In this study, we demonstrate the influence of graph minor embedding on fair sampling of degenerate ground states. For two embedded models that introduce auxiliary variables, numerical simulations of Schrödinger evolution revealed that fairness varies significantly depending on the embedding, and the chain strength is related to ground-state fairness. Using perturbation theory, we found that chain strength determines the energy landscape around ground states, with flatter landscapes having higher probabilities of being obtained.

Title: Relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function localization induced by nonHermitian colored noise
Authors: Pei Wang
Abstract: We develop a quantum field theory based on random nonHermitian actions, which upon quantization lead to stochastic nonlinear Schrödinger dynamics for the state vector. In this framework, Lorentz and spacetime translation symmetries are preserved only in a statistical sense: the probability distribution of the action remains invariant under these transformations. As a result, the theory describes ensembles of quantum-state trajectories whose probability distributions remain invariant under changes of reference frame. As a concrete example, we augment the Dirac action with a purely imaginary term coupling the fermion density operator to a universal colored noise. This noise is constructed by solving the d'Alembert equation with white noise as its source, using a generalized stochastic calculus in 1+3 dimensions. We demonstrate that the colored noise drives stochastic localization of wave packets and derive the localization length analytically. Remarkably, the localization length decreases as the size of the observable universe increases. Our model thus provides a potential framework for relativistic spontaneous wave-function collapse. While establishing consistency with Born's law remains an open challenge, the present work constitutes a step toward embedding collapse models into a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory.

Title: Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells
Authors: David Zwicker, Oliver W. Paulin, Cathelijne ter Burg
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situation inside cells. This review discusses three distinct aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets possess complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.

Title: Are Foundational Atomistic Models Reliable for Finite-Temperature Molecular Dynamics?
Authors: Denan Li, Jiyuan Yang, Xiangkai Chen, Lintao Yu, Shi Liu
Abstract: Machine learning force fields have emerged as promising tools for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, potentially offering quantum-mechanical accuracy with the efficiency of classical MD. Inspired by foundational large language models, recent years have seen considerable progress in developing foundational atomistic models, sometimes referred to as universal force fields, designed to cover most elements in the periodic table. This Perspective adopts a practitioner's viewpoint to ask a critical question: Are these foundational atomistic models reliable for one of their most compelling applications, in particular simulating finite-temperature dynamics? Instead of a broad benchmark, we use the canonical ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition in PbTiO$_3$ as a focused case study to evaluate prominent foundational atomistic models. Our findings suggest a potential disconnect between static accuracy and dynamic reliability. While 0 K properties are often well-reproduced, we observed that the models can struggle to consistently capture the correct phase transition, sometimes exhibiting simulation instabilities. We believe these challenges may stem from inherent biases in training data and a limited description of anharmonicity. These observed shortcomings, though demonstrated on a single system, appear to point to broader, systemic challenges that can be addressed with targeted fine-tuning. This Perspective serves not to rank models, but to initiate a crucial discussion on the practical readiness of foundational atomistic models and to explore future directions for their improvement.

Title: Superradiant Peak Emission Rate and Time in Quantum Emitter Arrays
Authors: Raphael Holzinger, Susanne F. Yelin
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator. Generally, the dimension of the density operator grows exponentially ($\sim \! 2^N$) with the number of emitters, in the absence of any symmetries such as in Dicke superradiance with full or partial permutational symmetry. We present a detailed study of the superradiant peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, for one-, two- and three-dimensional arrays in free-space and emitter chains coupled to waveguide reservoirs. For few emitters ($N\lesssim 14$) we utilize the full quantum master equation, and for mesoscopic emitter numbers ($N\lesssim 400$) we use a second- and third-order cumulant expansion of the operator averages to track the time evolution of the system.

Title: Macroscopicity and observational deficit in states, operations, and correlations
Authors: Teruaki Nagasawa, Eyuri Wakakuwa, Kohtaro Kato, Francesco Buscemi
Abstract: To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of macroscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability. This work is dedicated to Professor Ryszard Horodecki on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in deep admiration and gratitude for his pioneering contributions to quantum information theory.

Title: Quantitative calibration of a TWPA applied to an optomechanical platform

Abstract: In the last decade, the microwave quantum electronics toolbox has been enriched with quantum-limited detection devices such as Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs). The extreme sensitivity they provide is not only mandatory for some physics applications within quantum information processing, but is also the key element that will determine the detection limit of quantum sensing setups. In the framework of microwave optomechanical systems, an unprecedented range of small motions and forces is accessible, for which a specific quantitative calibration becomes necessary. We report on near quantum-limited measurements performed with an aluminum drumhead mechanical device within the temperature range 4 mK - 400 mK. The whole setup is carefully calibrated, especially taking into account the power-dependence of microwave absorption in the superconducting optomechanical cavity. This effect is commonly attributed to Two-Level-Systems (TLSs) present in the metal oxide. We demonstrate that a similar feature exists in the TWPA, and can be phenomenologically fit with adapted expressions. If not taken into account, the error on the signal strength can be as large as a factor of about 2, which is unacceptable for quantitative experiments. The power and temperature dependence is studied over the full parameter range, leading to an absolute definition of phonon population (i.e. Brownian motion amplitude), with an uncertainty +- 20 % limited by sources of noise internal to the optomechanical element.

Title: High-Throughput Mechanical Characterization of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles by Real-Time Deformability Cytometry
Authors: Maximilian Kloppe, Stefan J. Maurer, Tobias Abele, Kerstin Göpfrich, Sebastian Aland
Abstract: Real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) enables high-throughput, contact-free mechanical characterization of soft microscopic objects. Here we apply this technique to giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). To interpret vesicle deformation in RT-DC, we present a simulation-based model taking into account the area expansion modulus as the dominant mechanical parameter. Using phase-field simulations over a wide parameter space, we find GUV deformation to depend linearly on GUV area. Based on these results, we derive two complementary fitting strategies for extracting the area expansion modulus K from RT-DC data: a direct model-based fit for single-vesicle characterization and a noise-resistant collective approach that enables robust population-level estimates. Furthermore, we introduce a combined fitting method that integrates both approaches to filter outliers and improve accuracy in heterogeneous or noisy datasets. All methods scale across varying flow rates, channel geometries and buffer viscosities, and produce predictions of K consistent with literature values for different lipid compositions. Compared to traditional techniques such as micropipette aspiration, our approach offers orders of magnitude higher throughput without mechanical contact, making it particularly suitable for GUV population studies. Beyond mechanical phenotyping, this framework opens new avenues for sorting vesicle populations based on membrane mechanics, a capability of growing interest in synthetic biology and soft matter research.

Title: Thermalization in open many-body systems and KMS detailed balance
Authors: Matteo Scandi, Álvaro M. Alhambra
Abstract: Starting from a microscopic description of weak system-bath interactions, we derive from first principles a quantum master equation that does not rely on the well-known rotating wave approximation. This includes generic many-body systems, with Hamiltonians with vanishingly small energy spacings that forbid that approximation. The equation satisfies a general form of detailed balance, called KMS, which ensures exact convergence to the many-body Gibbs state. Unlike the more common notion of GNS detailed balance, this notion is compatible with the absence of the rotating wave approximation. We show that the resulting Lindbladian dynamics not only reproduces the thermal equilibrium point up to a small renormalization of the system Hamiltonian, but it also approximates the true system evolution with an error that grows at most linearly in time, giving an exponential improvement upon previous estimates. This master equation has quasi-local jump operators, can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, and reduces to the usual Davies dynamics in the limit of a coarse-graining time much larger than the inverse of the smallest frequency difference. With it, we provide a rigorous model of many-body thermalization relevant to both open quantum systems and quantum algorithms.

Title: Efficient Berry Phase Calculation via Adaptive Variational Quantum Computing Approach
Authors: Martin Mootz, Yong-Xin Yao
Abstract: We present an adaptive variational quantum algorithm to estimate the Berry phase accumulated by a nondegenerate ground state under cyclic, adiabatic evolution of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. Our method leverages cyclic adiabatic evolution of the Hamiltonian and employs adaptive variational quantum algorithms for state preparation and evolution, optimizing circuit efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. We benchmark our approach on dimerized Fermi-Hubbard chains with four sites, demonstrating precise Berry phase simulations in both noninteracting and interacting regimes. Our results show that circuit depths reach up to 106 layers for noninteracting systems and increase to 279 layers for interacting systems due to added complexity. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our scheme across a wide range of parameters governing adiabatic evolution and variational algorithm. These findings highlight the potential of adaptive variational quantum algorithms for advancing quantum simulations of topological materials and computing geometric phases in strongly correlated systems.

Title: Regularized Fluctuating Lattice Boltzmann Model
Authors: Marco Lauricella, Andrea Montessori, Adriano Tiribocchi, Sauro Succi
Abstract: We introduce a regularized fluctuating lattice Boltzmann model (Reg-FLBM) for the D3Q27 lattice, which incorporates thermal fluctuations through Hermite-based projections to ensure compliance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. By leveraging the recursive regularization framework, the model achieves thermodynamic consistency for both hydrodynamic and ghost modes. Compared to the conventional single-relaxation-time BGK-FLBM, the Reg-FLBM provides improved stability and a more accurate description of thermal fluctuations. The implementation is optimized for large-scale parallel simulations on GPU-accelerated architectures, enabling systematic investigation of fluctuation-driven phenomena in mesoscale and nanoscale fluid systems.

Authors: Yuan Chiang, Tobias Kreiman, Christine Zhang, Matthew C. Kuner, Elizabeth Weaver, Ishan Amin, Hyunsoo Park, Yunsung Lim, Jihan Kim, Daryl Chrzan, Aron Walsh, Samuel M. Blau, Mark Asta, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized molecular and materials modeling, but existing benchmarks suffer from data leakage, limited transferability, and an over-reliance on error-based metrics tied to specific density functional theory (DFT) references. We introduce MLIP Arena, a benchmark platform that evaluates force field performance based on physics awareness, chemical reactivity, stability under extreme conditions, and predictive capabilities for thermodynamic properties and physical phenomena. By moving beyond static DFT references and revealing the important failure modes of current foundation MLIPs in real-world settings, MLIP Arena provides a reproducible framework to guide the next-generation MLIP development toward improved predictive accuracy and runtime efficiency while maintaining physical consistency. The Python package and online leaderboard are available at this https URL.

Title: Geometric Categories for Continuous Gauging
Authors: Devon Stockall, Matthew Yu
Abstract: We develop a unified categorical framework for gauging both continuous and finite symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Our construction applies to geometric categories i.e. categories internal to stacks. This generalizes the familiar setting of fusion categories, which describe finite group symmetries, to the case of Lie group symmetries. Within this framework, we obtain a functorial Symmetry Topological Field Theory together with its natural boundaries, allowing us to compute associated endomorphism categories and Drinfeld centers in a uniform way. For a given symmetry group $G$, our framework recovers the electric and magnetic higher-form symmetries expected in $G$-gauge theory. Moreover, it naturally encodes electric breaking symmetry in the presence of charged matter, reproducing known physical phenomena in a categorical setting.
