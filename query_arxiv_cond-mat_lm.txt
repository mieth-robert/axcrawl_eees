Title: Magnetometry with Broadband Microwave Fields in Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond
Authors: Arezoo Afshar, Andrew Proppe, Noah Lupu-Gladstein, Lilian Childress, Aaron Z. Goldberg, Khabat Heshami
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are optically addressable and versatile light-matter interfaces with practical application in magnetic field sensing, offering the ability to operate at room temperature and reach sensitivities below pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}.$ We propose an approach to simultaneously probe all of the magnetically sensitive states using a broadband microwave field and demonstrate that it can be used to measure the external DC magnetic field strength with sensitivities below 1~nT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}.$ We develop tools for analyzing the temporal signatures in the transmitted broadband microwaves to estimate the magnetic field, comparing maximum likelihood estimation based on minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence to various neural network models, and both methods independently reach practical sensitivities. These results are achieved without optimizing parameters such as the bandwidth, power, and shape of the probing microwave field such that, with further improvements, sensitivities down to $\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ can be envisioned. Our results motivate novel implementations of NV-based magnetic sensors with the potential for vectorial magnetic field detection at 1-10 kHz update rates and improved sensitivities without requiring a bias magnetic field.

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are optically addressable spin defects with great potential for nanoscale quantum sensing. A key application of NV centers is the detection of external spins at the diamond surface. Among metals, platinum thin films - widely used in spintronics, catalysis and electrochemistry - provide a particularly interesting system for such studies. However, the interaction between NV centers and metals is known to affect their quantum sensing capabilities. In this work, we study five platinum-covered diamond samples containing shallow NVs created via nitrogen implantation with different energies (2.5-60 keV) and investigate the optical and quantum properties of NV ensembles beneath the metal films. We find a substantial reduction of the photoluminescence lifetime and a pronounced decrease of the NV$^{-}$ population for NV ensembles located near the platinum layer. As a result, optically detected magnetic resonance experiments could only be efficiently performed on diamonds implanted with at least 20 keV, where we observed a strong increase in the T$_{2}$ coherence time beneath the platinum thin films. Our study describes the various processes affecting NV centers near platinum films and provides guidance for the integration of thin metal films with near-surface NV centers.

Title: Algorithmic Temperature Induced by Adopted Regular Universal Turing Machine
Authors: Kentaro Imafuku
Abstract: We prove that an effective temperature naturally emerges from the algorithmic structure of a regular universal Turing machine (UTM), without introducing any external physical parameter. In particular, the redundancy growth of the machine's wrapper language induces a Boltzmann--like exponential weighting over program lengths, yielding a canonical ensemble interpretation of algorithmic probability. This establishes a formal bridge between algorithmic information theory and statistical mechanics, in which the adopted UTM determines the intrinsic ``algorithmic temperature.'' We further show that this temperature approaches its maximal limit under the universal mixture (Solomonoff distribution), and discuss its epistemic meaning as the resolution level of an observer.

Title: Universal behaviors of the multi-time correlation functions of random processes with renewal: the step noise case (the random velocity of a Lévy walk)
Authors: Marco Bianucci, Mauro Bologna, Daniele Lagomarsino-Oneto, Riccardo Mannella
Abstract: Stochastic processes with renewal properties are powerful tools for modeling systems where memory effects and long-time correlations play a significant role. In this work, we study a broad class of renewal processes where a variable's value changes according to a prescribed Probability Density Function (PDF), $p(\xi)$, after random waiting times $\theta$. This model is relevant across many fields, including classical chaos, nonlinear hydrodynamics, quantum dots, cold atom dynamics, biological motion, foraging, and finance. We derive a general analytical expression for the $n$-time correlation function by averaging over process realizations. Our analysis identifies the conditions for stationarity, aging, and long-range correlations based on the waiting time and jump distributions. Among the many consequences of our analysis, two new key results emerge. First, for Poissonian waiting times, the correlation function quickly approaches that of telegraphic noise. Second, for power-law waiting times with $\mu>2$, , \emph{any $n$-time correlation function asymptotically reduces to the two-time correlation evaluated at the earliest and latest time points}. This second result reveals a universal long-time behavior where the system's full statistical structure becomes effectively two-time reducible. Furthermore, if the jump PDF $p(\xi)$ has fat tails, this convergence becomes independent of the waiting time PDF and is significantly accelerated, requiring only modest increases in either the number of realizations or the trajectory lengths. Building upon earlier work that established the universality of the two-point correlation function (i.e., a unique formal expression depending solely on the variance of $\xi$ and on the waiting-time PDF), the present study extends that universality to the full statistical description of a broad class of renewal-type stochastic processes.

Title: Epitaxial Electrodeposition of Fe with Controlled In-Plane Variants for Reversible Metal Anode in Aqueous Electrolyte
Authors: Chenxi Sui, Ching-Tai Fu, Guangxia Feng, Yuqi Li, Junyan Li, Gangbin Yan, Po-Chun Hsu, Steven Chu, Yi Cui
Abstract: The development of reversible metal anodes is a key challenge for advancing aqueous battery technologies, particularly for scalable and safe stationary energy storage applications. Here we demonstrate a strategy to realize epitaxial electrodeposition of iron (Fe) on single-crystal copper (Cu) substrates in aqueous electrolytes. We compare the electrodeposition behavior of Fe on polycrystalline and single-crystalline Cu substrates, revealing that the latter enables highly uniform, dense, and crystallographically aligned Fe growth. Comprehensive electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms the formation of Fe with specific out-of-plane and in-plane orientations, including well-defined rotational variants. Our findings highlight that epitaxial electrodeposition of Fe can suppress dendritic growth and significantly enhance Coulombic efficiency during plating/stripping cycles. This approach bridges fundamental crystallography with practical electrochemical performance, providing a pathway toward high-efficiency aqueous batteries utilizing Earth-abundant materials.

Title: Non-Normal Eigenvector Amplification in Multi-Dimensional Kesten Processes
Authors: Virgile Troude, Didier Sornette
Abstract: Heavy-tailed fluctuations and power law statistics pervade physics, finance, and economics, yet their origin is often ascribed to systems poised near criticality. Here we show that such behavior can emerge far from instability through a universal mechanism of non-normal eigenvector amplification in multidimensional Kesten processes $x_{t+1}=A_t x_t+\eta_t$, where $A_t$ are random interaction matrices and $\eta_t$ represents external inputs, capturing the evolving interdependence among $N$ coupled components. Even when each random multiplicative matrix is spectrally stable, non-orthogonal eigenvectors generate transient growth that renormalizes the Lyapunov exponent and lowers the tail exponent, producing stationary power laws without eigenvalues crossing the stability boundary. We derive explicit relations linking the Lyapunov exponent and the tail index to the statistics of the condition number, $\gamma\!\sim\!\gamma_0+\ln\kappa$ and $\alpha\!\sim\!-2\gamma/\sigma_\kappa^2$, confirmed by numerical simulations. This framework offers a unifying geometric perspective that help interpret diverse phenomena, including polymer stretching in turbulence, magnetic field amplification in dynamos, volatility clustering and wealth inequality in financial systems. Non-normal interactions provide a collective route to scale-free behavior in globally stable systems, defining a new universality class where multiplicative feedback and transient amplification generate critical-like statistics without spectral criticality.

Title: Adjoint ferromagnets
Authors: Joaquín López-Suárez, Alexios P. Polychronakos, Konstantinos Sfetsos
Abstract: We derive the phase structure and thermodynamics of ferromagnets consisting of elementary magnets carrying the adjoint representation of $SU(N)$ and coupled through two-body quadratic interactions. Such systems have a continuous $SU(N)$ symmetry as well as a discrete conjugation symmetry. We uncover a rich spectrum of phases and transitions, involving a paramagnetic and two distinct ferromagnetic phases that can coexist as stable and metastable states in different combinations over a range of temperatures. The ferromagnetic phases break $SU(N)$ invariance in various channels, leading to spontaneous magnetization. Interestingly, the conjugation symmetry also breaks over a range of temperatures and group ranks $N$, providing a realization of a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry.

Title: Universal scaling of shear thickening suspensions under acoustic perturbation
Authors: Anna R. Barth, Navneet Singh, Stephen J. Thornton, Pranav Kakhandiki, Edward Y.X. Ong, Meera Ramaswamy, Abhishek M. Shetty, Bulbul Chakraborty, James P. Sethna, Itai Cohen
Abstract: Tuning shear thickening behavior is a longstanding problem in the field of dense suspensions. Acoustic perturbations offer a convenient way to control shear thickening in real time, opening the door to a new class of smart materials. However, complete control over shear thickening requires a quantitative description for how suspension viscosity varies under acoustic perturbation. Here, we achieve this goal by experimentally probing suspensions with acoustic perturbations and incorporating their effect on the suspension viscosity into a universal scaling framework where the viscosity is described by a scaling function, which captures a crossover from the frictionless jamming critical point to a frictional shear jamming critical point. Our analysis reveals that the effect of acoustic perturbations may be explained by the introduction of an effective interparticle repulsion whose magnitude is roughly equal to the acoustic energy density. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this scaling framework may be leveraged to produce explicit predictions for the viscosity of a dense suspension under acoustic perturbation. Our results demonstrate the utility of the scaling framework for experimentally manipulating shear thickening systems.

Title: Symmetry and Memory in Driven Disordered Systems
Authors: Surendra Padamata, Nathan C. Keim
Abstract: Steadily shearing a non-Brownian suspension forms a memory of direction in its structure, while periodically shearing it forms a memory of amplitude. Our experiments show that these memories coexist and compete within a limited memory capacity. A specific oscillatory amplitude, previously associated with a critical transition, suppresses the directional (fore-aft) asymmetry. A similar picture is known in amorphous solids. We propose that these competing kinds of memory are a motif for non-equilibrium systems coupled to a scalar drive and are a basic example of interplay between memories.

Title: Non-perturbatively slow spread of quantum correlations in non-resonant systems
Authors: Ben T. McDonough, Marius Lemm, Andrew Lucas
Abstract: Strong disorder often has drastic consequences for quantum dynamics. This is best illustrated by the phenomenon of Anderson localization in non-interacting systems, where destructive quantum wave interference leads to the complete absence of particle and information transport over macroscopic distances. In this work, we investigate the extent to which strong disorder leads to provably slow dynamics in many-body quantum lattice models. We show that in any spatial dimension, strong disorder leads to a non-perturbatively small velocity for ballistic information transport under unitary quantum dynamics, almost surely in the thermodynamic limit, in every many-body state. In these models, we also prove the existence of a "prethermal many-body localized regime", where entanglement spreads logarithmically slowly, up to non-perturbatively long time scales. More generally, these conclusions hold for all models corresponding to quantum perturbations to a classical Hamiltonian obeying a simple non-resonant condition. Deterministic non-resonant models are found, including spin systems in strong incommensurate lattice potentials. Consequently, quantum dynamics in non-resonant potentials is asymptotically easier to simulate on both classical or quantum computers, compared to a generic many-body system.

Title: Topological Robustness of Anyon Tunneling at $ν= 1/3$
Authors: Adithya Suresh, Ramon Guerrero-Suarez, Tanmay Maiti, Shuang Liang, Geoffrey Gardner, Claudio Chamon, Michael Manfra
Abstract: The scaling exponent $g$ of the quasiparticle propagator for incompressible fractional quantum Hall states in the Laughlin sequence is expected to be robust against perturbations that do not close the gap. Here we probe the topological robustness of the chiral Luttinger liquid at the boundary of the $\nu=1/3$ state by measuring the tunneling conductance between counterpropagating edge modes as a function of quantum point contact transmission. We demonstrate that for transmission $t\geq 0.7$ the tunneling conductance is well-described by the first two terms of a perturbative series expansion corresponding to $g=1/3$. We further demonstrate that the measured scaling exponent is robustly pinned to $g=1/3$ across the plateau, only deviating as the bulk state becomes compressible. Finally we examine the impact of weak disorder on the scaling exponent, finding it insensitive. These measurements firmly establish the topological robustness of anyon tunneling at $\nu=1/3$ and substantiate the chiral Luttinger liquid description of the edge mode.

Title: Neuromorphic heat transport effects in a molecular junction
Authors: Renai Chen, Galen T. Craven
Abstract: Understanding energy transport at the nanoscale is an open and fundamental challenge in the molecular sciences with direct implications for the design of new electronics, computing devices, and materials. While nanoscale energy transport under steady-state conditions has been studied extensively, there is much less known about energy transport under time-dependent driving forces, particularly in the far-from-equilibrium regime. In this work, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and stochastic thermodynamics to investigate energy transport in a well-studied nanoscale system, a molecular junction, subjected to a time-periodic temperature gradient. The primary observation is that molecular junctions can exhibit heat transport hysteresis, a phenomenon in which the heat flux through a system depends not only on the instantaneous value of a time-dependent temperature bias but also on the temporal history of that bias. The presented findings illustrate that molecular junctions can exhibit the specific memory effect, heat transport hysteresis, that is essential for the design of thermal neuromorphic computers. This work elucidates a potential pathway toward the realization of such devices.

Title: Modelling of magnetic vortex microdisc dynamics under varying magnetic field in biological viscoelastic environments
Authors: Andrea Visonà, Robert Morel, Hélène Joisten, Bernard Dieny, Alice Nicolas
Abstract: Magnetically driven microparticles provide a versatile platform for probing and manipulating biological systems, yet the physical framework governing their actuation in complex environments remains only partially explored. Within the field of cellular magneto-mechanical stimulation, vortex microdiscs have emerged as particularly promising candidates for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we introduce a simplified two-dimensional model describing the magneto-mechanical response of such particles embedded in viscoelastic media under varying magnetic fields. Using a Maxwell description of the medium combined with simplified elasticity assumptions, we derive analytical expressions and support them with numerical simulations of particle motion under both oscillating and rotating magnetic fields. Our results show that rotating fields typically induce oscillatory dynamics and that the transition to asynchronous motion occurs at a critical frequency determined by viscosity and stiffness. The amplitude and phase of this motion is governed by the competition between magnetic and viscoelastic contributions, with particle motion being strongly impaired when the latter dominate. Energy-based considerations further demonstrate that, within the frequency range explored of few tens of Hertz, no heat is generated -- distinguishing this approach from magnetic hyperthermia -- while the elastic energy transferred to the surrounding medium is, in principle, sufficient to perturb major cellular processes. This work provides a simple framework to anticipate the first-order influence of rheological properties on magnetically driven microdisc dynamics, thereby enabling a better understanding of their impact in cells or extracellular materials and bridging the gap between experimental observations and theoretical modelling.

Title: Low-field all-optical detection of superconductivity using NV nanodiamonds
Authors: Omkar Dhungel, Saravanan Sengottuvel, Mariusz Mrozek, Till Lenz, Nir Bar-Gill, Adam M. Wojciechowski, Arne Wickenbrock, Dmitry Budker
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamond offer a microwave-free, noninvasive platform for probing superconductors via near zero-field cross-relaxation magnetometry. We demonstrate this by depositing nanodiamonds on YBCO thin films to measure critical parameters: transition temperature and penetration field. This method leverages nanodiamond fluorescence modulation as a result of magnetic field variation with 1mT amplitude to observe the Meissner effect and field scans to measure the penetration field. The approach is minimally invasive and can be applied to superconducting samples with rough surfaces, facilitating the study of flux vortices and critical phenomena in complex geometries.

Title: Bond-resolved STM with density-based methods
Authors: Emiliano Ventura-Macias, Jose Martinez-Castro, Guillermo Haas, Jara Trujillo-Mulero, Pablo Pou, Taner Esat, Markus Ternes, Ruslan Temirov, F. Stefan Tautz, Ruben Perez
Abstract: Bond-resolved STM (BRSTM) is a recent technique that combines the advantages of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with the outstanding intramolecular resolution provided by non-contact atomic force microscopy (ncAFM) using a CO-functionalized tips, offering unique insights into molecular interactions at surfaces. In this work, we present a novel and easily implementable approach for simulating BRSTM images, which we have applied to reproduce new experimental BRSTM data of Perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) on Ag(111), obtained with unprecedented control of tip-sample separation ($\sim$10~pm). Our method integrates the Full-Density-Based Model (FDBM) developed for High-Resolution Atomic Force Microscopy (HRAFM) with Chen's derivative approximation for tunneling channels, effectively capturing the contributions of both $\sigma$ and $\pi$ channels, while accounting for the CO-tip deflection induced by probe-sample interactions. This approach accurately reproduces the experimental results for both PTCDA/Ag(111) and 1,5,9-trioxo-13-azatriangulene (TOAT)/Cu(111) systems, including intricate tip-sample distance-dependent features. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the important role of substrate-induced effects, which can modify molecular orbital occupation and the relaxation of the CO probe, resulting in distinct BRSTM image characteristics.

Title: Spectroscopy of Sm$^{3+}$ Ions in the C$_{\rm s}$ Symmetry Centres of Hydrothermally Prepared K$_2$YF$_5$ Microcrystals
Authors: Pakwan Chanprakhon, Michael F. Reid, and Jon-Paul R. Wells
Abstract: We report on the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of Sm$^{3+}$-doped K$_2$YF$_5$ microparticles. The particles were synthesized via the hydrothermal technique, yielding a particle size of approximately 20 $\mu$m in length. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses confirmed their orthorhombic crystal structure. A combination of absorption and laser excited fluorescence performed on samples cooled to 10~K, allow for the determination of {56} experimental crystal-field levels. A parametrised crystal-field analysis for Sm$^{3+}$ in the C$_{\rm s}$ point group symmetry centres of K$_2$YF$_5$ yields good approximation to the data.

Title: Thermal transport in GaN/AlN HEMTs on 4H-SiC: Role of layer thickness and hetero-interfaces
Authors: Dat Q. Tran, Minho Kim, Okhyun Nam, Vanya Darakchieva, Plamen P. Paskov
Abstract: Thermal transport in high-electron-mobility-transistor (HEMT) structures grown on 4H-SiC substrates by metalorganic-vapour-phase epitaxy (MOCVD) is systematically investigated. The thermal conductivity of the GaN channel and AlN buffer layers is measured by thermoreflectance (TTR). A pronounced thickness dependence of thermal conductivity as a result of phonon-boundary scattering is observed at low temperatures, while this effect becomes significantly weaker at elevated temperatures. The thermal boundary resistance (TBR) at the AlN/4H-SiC and GaN/AlN interfaces is also examined, showing a substantial reduction and eventual saturation with increasing temperature, indicating elastic phonon transport as the dominant mechanism. Reliable simulations of the temperature profile across the structures based on the measured thermal metrics highlight the critical role of TBR in thin-channel device and the advantage of thicker channel and buffer layers for efficient heat dissipation in the HEMTs.

Abstract: We present a technique for partitioning the total energy from a semi-local density functional theory calculation into contributions from individual electronic states in a localized Wannier basis. We use our technique to reveal the key role played by the $s$ and $p$ orbitals of the apical oxygen atoms in a curious elastic anomaly exhibited by ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ under applied stress, which has so far gone unexplained. Our technique enables new insights into the chemical origins of the mechanical properties of materials, or any property given by an energy derivative.

Title: Microscopic Intricacies of Self-Healing in Halide Perovskite-Charge Transport Layer Heterostructures
Authors: Tejmani Behera, Boris Louis, Lukas Paesen, Roel Vanden Brande, Koki Asano, Martin Vacha, Maarten Roeffaers, Elke Debroye, Johan Hofkens, Sudipta Setha
Abstract: The stability and performance of halide perovskite photovoltaic devices are critically limited by progressive defect generation and associated local non-radiative losses during operation. Self-healing of defects provides a promising pathway to prolong device functionality, yet the underlying microscopic mechanisms remain poorly understood, particularly the role of interfacial chemistry on trap dynamics and healing kinetics. Here, we elucidate self-healing and defect evolution in triple-cation mixed halide (TCMH) perovskite films and their device-relevant charge transport layer heterostructures subjected to photo-induced damage. Using correlation clustering imaging (CLIM), our recently developed local functional imaging tool, we map spatiotemporal photoluminescence heterogeneity to track defect dynamics in pristine and heterostructure films. The defect healing follows bi-phasic kinetics, with an initial electronic relaxation (tens of minutes) and a subsequent slower phase (~ hours) associated to ionic and lattice rearrangement. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that the chemical nature of charge-transport layers modulates trap activity, healing kinetics, and halide redistribution, with heterostructures exhibiting faster recovery than pristine films, a boon for device resilience. These findings provide new insights into the dynamic interaction between defects, interfaces, and ion migration, and establish a framework for rational design of durable, next-generation perovskite optoelectronic devices.

Title: The Comparison of Colloidal PbS QD Photoconductors and Hybrid Phototransistors
Authors: Gökhan Kara, Lorenzo J. A. Ferraresi, Dmitry N. Dirin, Roman Furrer, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Michel Calame, Ivan Shorubalko
Abstract: The simplicity in the fabrication of photoconductors makes them a valuable choice to investigate optoelectronic properties of colloidal quantum dot (cQD) films. Lateral photoconductors generally require a large size, in the mm2, and are limited in operation speed due to the presence of trapping sites. In contrast, hybrid phototransistors are fabricated in the um2 scale and benefit from such trapping sites, allowing the measurement of low light levels in the nW/cm2. The question, however, arises whether high responsivity values are required for the detection of low light levels or the compatible detectivity of photoconductors is sufficient. Here, we directly compare photoconductors and hybrid phototransistors with an identical EDT-treated PbS cQD film. We highlight that a comparable D* is not enough for the purpose of measuring low light levels, as the resulting photocurrents need to be readily accessible. Furthermore, we also showcase temperature-activated photocurrent dynamics resulting in a negative photocurrent (NPC) effect. This NPC simultaneously improves the frequency bandwidth and photocurrent, enabling operation speeds up to 100 kHz.

Title: Evidence for easy-plane XY ferromagnetism in heavy-fermion quantum-critical CeRh6Ge4
Authors: Riku Yamamoto, Sejun Park, Zachary W. Riedel, Phurba Sherpa, Joe D. Thompson, Filip Ronning, Eric D. Bauer, Adam P. Dioguardi, Michihiro Hirata
Abstract: We report $^{73}$Ge nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) and magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in the heavy-fermion quantum-critical ferromagnet CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$. NQR and NMR spectral measurements at the two non-equivalent Ge sites reveal electric field gradient tensors and the directions of their principal axes relative to the hexagonal basal plane. The spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ experiments reveal a clear critical slowing down approaching the ferromagnetic transition. $1/T_1$ in the paramagnetic state is found to be predominantly caused by fluctuating 4$f$-local moments. The Knight shift shows Curie-Weiss behavior at high temperature and a deviation from this below $T^\ast$ $\approx$ 25 K possibly due to a mixture of crystalline electric field effects and Kondo screening. Order-parameter-like behavior of hyperfine fields at the Ge sites and ferromagnetic signal enhancement are observed in Zeeman-perturbed NQR, with uniform ferromagnetic order and a small ordered moment of $\approx$ 0.26 $\mu_B$/Ce confined within the $ab$-plane. The ordered moment shows a notable in-plane magnetic stiffness against out-of-plane radiofrequency fields and has an (XY-type) in-plane isotropic nature. Our results reveal a strong easy-plane anisotropy of 4$f$-electron moment and suggest an involved interplay of hybridization and local moment physics in this quantum critical heavy-fermion ferromagnet.

Title: Visualizing the Impact of Quenched Disorder on 2D Electron Wigner Solids

Abstract: Electron Wigner solids (WSs)1-12 provide an ideal system for understanding the competing effects of electron-electron and electron-disorder interactions, a central unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. Progress in this topic has been limited by a lack of single-defect-resolved experimental measurements as well as accurate theoretical tools to enable realistic experiment-theory comparison. Here we overcome these limitations by combining atomically-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation of disordered 2D electron WSs. STM was used to image the electron density ($n_e$) dependent evolution of electron WSs in gate-tunable bilayer MoSe$_2$ devices with varying long-range ($n_\mathrm{LR}$) and short-range ($n_\mathrm{SR}$) disorder densities. These images were compared to QMC simulations using realistic disorder maps extracted from experiment, thus allowing the roles of different disorder types to be disentangled. We identify two distinct physical regimes for disordered electron WSs that depend on the magnitude of $n_\mathrm{SR}$. For $n_\mathrm{SR} \lesssim n_e$ the WS behavior is dominated by long-range disorder and features extensive mixed solid-liquid phases, a new type of re-entrant melting-crystallization, and prominent Friedel oscillations. In contrast, when $n_\mathrm{SR} \gg n_e$ these features are suppressed and a more robust amorphous WS phase emerges that persists to higher $n_e$, highlighting the importance of short-range disorder in this regime. Our work establishes a new framework for studying disordered quantum solids via a combined experimental-theoretical approach.

Title: Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition of AlScN Thin Films and AlScN/AlN/GaN Heterostructures
Authors: Vijay Gopal Thirupakuzi Vangipuram, Abdul Mukit, Kaitian Zhang, Salva Salmani-Rezaie, Hongping Zhao
Abstract: AlScN thin films were grown via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), showing controllable incorporation of scandium (Sc) into the AlN lattices. Systematic variation of growth parameters demonstrated an obvious influence on Sc incorporation, with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicating Sc composition up to $\sim$13\% when (MCp)$_2$ScCl was used as the precursor. AlScN/AlN/GaN heterostructures grown on GaN templates exhibited the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel at the AlScN/AlN--GaN interface, confirming their potential use in high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) device technologies. Variation in AlScN/AlN barrier thickness within the heterostructures showed that thicker barriers yield higher sheet charge densities from both Hall and capacitance-voltage (C--V) measurements. With an AlScN/AlN barrier thickness of $\sim$30~nm, a sheet charge density of $5.22\times10^{12}$~cm$^{-2}$ was extracted from C--V. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) further confirmed Sc incorporation and revealed the wurtzite crystalline structure of the films and heterostructures. These results establish MOCVD growth of AlScN as a promising and compatible material for advancing III-nitride heterostructures in high-performance electronics and potentially ferroelectrics.

Title: Optimal run-tumble navigation in disordered landscapes
Authors: Yang Bai, Caiyun He, Weirong Liu, Songtao Cheng, Pan Chu, Liang Luo, Chenli Liu, Xiongfei Fu
Abstract: Active navigation in disordered media is governed by the interplay between self-propulsion and environmental constraints. Using the chemotaxis of E. coli in agar gels as a model system, we uncover a universal trade-off between persistence and obstacle avoidance that dictates optimal search strategies. We find that populations evolving under pressure for rapid expansion adapt by shortening their mean run time ({\tau}_f), counter to the intuition that longer runs always favor faster migration. Controlled experiments with a tunable strain confirm a non-monotonic relationship between run time and chemotactic velocity, with a clear optimum that shifts with environmental trap density. At the single-agent level, we identify and characterize a key motility state: transient trapping in the gel's pores. A minimal theoretical model, integrating run-tumble and run-trap dynamics, explains the optimum as a consequence of the antagonistic scaling of the diffusion coefficient (increasing with {\tau}_f) and the chemotactic bias coefficient (decreasing with {\tau}_f). This work establishes a general principle for the optimization of active matter transport in complex and obstructed environments.

Title: Chern-Selective multi-valley Flat Bands in Twisted Mono-Bilayer and Mono-Trilayer MoTe$_2$
Authors: Ziyue Qi, Hanqi Pi, Yan Zhang, Jiaxuan Liu, Nicolas Regnault, Hongming Weng, B. Andrei Bernevig, Jiabin Yu, Quansheng Wu
Abstract: The interplay between moiré flat bands originating from different valleys can give rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases. In this work, we investigate the electronic properties of twisted mono-bilayer (A-AB) and mono-trilayer (A-ABA) MoTe$_2$ using first-principles calculations and continuum models. Unlike previous studies on twisted bilayer systems, in which low-energy flat bands originate solely from the $K/K'$ valleys, in A-AB and A-ABA twisted MoTe$_2$ (\tmt) the moiré bands at low energies arise from both the $\Gamma$ and $K/K'$ valleys, with spin Chern numbers $C_s=0$ (for $\Gamma$) and $C_{\uparrow/\downarrow}=\pm1$ (for $K/K'$), respectively. We show that the multi-valley moiré flat bands are governed by interlayer-hybridization effects, and that different stacking configurations and thicknesses tune the relative energy alignment between the $\Gamma$ and $K$ valley moiré flat bands. By constructing valley-resolved continuum models and performing Wannierization for the low-energy moiré bands, we further uncover that the Berry curvature and quantum metric distributions can be effectively tuned by the layer number and stacking configuration. Unlike other moiré systems, where only one kind of valley influenced the low energy physics, the simultaneous appearance of two distinct types of valleys, with different symmetries, establish A-AB and A-ABA \tmt\ as ideal platforms for studying layer-controlled multi-valley physics.

Title: Nanoscale surface morphology controls charge storage at stepped Pt-water interfaces
Authors: Matthew T. Darby, Muhammad Saleh, Marialore Sulpizi, Clotilde S. Cucinotta
Abstract: Platinum step edges dominate electrocatalytic activity in fuel cells and electrolysers, yet their atomistic electrochemical behaviour remains poorly understood. Here, we employ \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics under controlled electrode potentials to model a realistic stepped Pt--water interface incorporating experimentally observed (111)$\times$(111) and (111)$\times$(100) edge motifs. This allows us to resolve, for the first time, the site-specific structure, charge distribution, and electrostatics of the electric double layer at a nanostructured Pt surface. We find that differential capacitance near the potential of zero charge (PZC) arises almost entirely from potential-dependent chemisorption of water on flat (111) terraces. In contrast, step edges are saturated with chemisorbed water even below the PZC and thus do not contribute to the capacitance. Instead, edges accumulate excess positive charge and exhibit a locally elevated electrostatic potential, as revealed by spatially resolved macroscopic potential profiles. This electrostatic asymmetry implies a greater barrier for electron accumulation at step sites compared to terraces, consistent with enhanced charge localisation and reactivity. Finally, the higher-in-energy d-band centre and sharper projected density of states at edge atoms further support their role as active, positively charged centres. Together, these results provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed experimental shift of the PZC with step density and establish a predictive framework for understanding and optimising interfacial charging in nanostructured Pt electrocatalysts.

Title: Trembling motion of electrons driven by Larmor spin precession
Authors: I. Stepanov, M. Ersfeld, A. V. Poshakinskiy, M. Lepsa, E. L. Ivchenko, S. A. Tarasenko, B. Beschoten
Abstract: We show that the initialization of an ensemble of electrons in the same spin state in strained n-InGaAs subject to a perpendicular magnetic field triggers an AC electric current at GHz frequencies. The AC current emerges in the absence of any driving force and survives until the coherent precession of the electron spins is lost. The current amplitude increases linearly with both the spin-orbit coupling strength and the external magnetic field. The generation mechanism of the observed oscillatory charge motion can be fruitfully described in terms of the periodic trembling motion of spin-polarized electrons, which is a solid-state analog to the Zitterbewegung of free Dirac electrons. Our results demonstrate that the hidden consequence of relativistic quantum mechanics is realized and can be studied in a rather simple solid-state system at moderate temperatures. Furthermore, the large amplitude of the AC current at high magnetic fields enables ultra-fast spin sensitive electric read-out in solids.

Abstract: Organic surface ligands are integral components of nanocrystals and nanoparticles that have a strong influence on their physicochemical properties, their interaction with the environment, and their ability to self-assemble and order into higher-order structures. These hybrid nanomaterials are tunable with applications in catalysis, directed self-assembly, next-generation optoelectronics, and chemical and quantum sensing. Critically, future advances depend on our ability to rationally engineer their surface chemistry. However, fundamental knowledge of ligand-nanoparticle behavior is limited by uncertainty in where and how these ligands bind to surfaces. For nanoparticles, in particular, few characterization techniques offer both the high spatial resolution and the precise chemical mapping needed to identify specific ligand binding sites. In this study, we utilized synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy (SINS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) together with first-principles computer simulations to validate the site-selective adsorption of organic ligands on a shaped nanocrystal surface. Specifically, we demonstrate that the sterically encumbered isocyanide ligands (CNAr^{Mes2}) preferentially bind to the high curvature features of Ag nanocubes (NCs), where low-coordinate Ag atoms are present. In contrast, isocyanide ligands that do not exhibit these steric properties show no surface selectivity. SINS serves as an effective tool to validate these surface binding interactions at the near-single molecule level. These results indicate that steric effects can be successfully harnessed to design bespoke organic ligands for fine-tuning nanocrystal surface chemistry and the properties of the nanocrystal ligand shell.

Title: Room temperature control of axial and basal antiferromagnetic anisotropies using strain
Authors: Jack Harrison, Junxiong Hu, Charles Godfrey, Jheng-Cyuan Lin, Tim A Butcher, Jörg Raabe, Simone Finizio, Hariom Jani, Paolo G Radaelli
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic materials are promising platforms for the development of ultra-fast spintronics and magnonics due to their robust magnetism, high-frequency relativistic dynamics, low-loss transport, and the ability to support topological textures. However, achieving deterministic control over antiferromagnetic order in thin films is a major challenge, due to the formation of multi-domain states stabilised by competing magnetic and destressing interactions. Thus, the successful implementation of antiferromagnetic materials necessitates careful engineering of their anisotropy. Here, we demonstrate strain-based robust control over multiple antiferromagnetic anisotropies and nanoscale domains in the promising spintronic candidate a-Fe2O3, at room temperature. By applying isotropic and anisotropic in-plane strains across a broad temperature-strain phase space, we systematically tune the interplay between magneto-crystalline and magneto-elastic interactions. We discover that strain-driven control steers the system towards an aligned antiferromagnetic state, whilst preserving topological spin textures, such as merons, antimerons and bimerons. We directly map the nanoscale antiferromagnetic order using linear dichroic scanning transmission X-ray microscopy integrated with in situ strain and temperature control. A Landau model and micromagnetic simulations reveal how strain reshapes the magnetic energy landscape. These findings suggest that strain could serve as a versatile control mechanism to reconfigure equilibrium or dynamic antiferromagnetic states on demand in a-Fe2O3, paving the way for next-generation spintronic and magnonic devices.

Title: Generalized Fokker-Planck equation for the active Brownian motion
Authors: Sanju S Pillai, M Muhsin, M Sahoo
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of an inertial active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle suspended in a non-Markovian environment. The particle is additionally subjected to external forces, such as harmonic confinement and a magnetic field. Motivated by the importance of understanding the non-Markovian behavior of complex environments, we examine the impact of a viscoelastic medium by employing the Jeffrey fluid framework for modeling the particle motion, which effectively captures both viscous and elastic contributions of the environment. Within this model, we explicitly derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation for each case. Building on this, we extend the analysis to general non-Markovian framework and derive the corresponding generalized Fokker-Planck equation for a free active particle. Furthermore, we obtain the probability distribution function valid for arbitrary memory kernel under various conditions, including both free and confined motion with and without a magnetic field. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first attempt to establish such a comprehensive formalism for the probabilistic description of an active particle subjected to non-Markovian memory effects. This formulation provides a solid basis for analyzing the dynamics of an active particle in a non-Markovian environment, such as mucus and polymer solutions, and further allows the study of relaxation in confined geometries and responses to external fields.

Title: Superconductivity in monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure
Authors: Chaoxin Huang, Jingyuan Li, Xing Huang, Hengyuan Zhang, Deyuan Hu, Mengwu Huo, Xiang Chen, Zhen Chen, Hualei Sun, Meng Wang
Abstract: The discovery of 80 K superconductivity in pressurized bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has established a new high-temperature superconductor family. The quest to understand the governing principles of RP nickelate superconductivity has become a central focus in condensed matter physics. Here, we report a critical advance by synthesizing and investigating a distinct structural polymorph of the same compound: the monolayer-trilayer (1313) hybrid phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Under high pressure, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy reveal a structural transition from the orthorhombic $Cmmm$ to the tetragonal $P4/mmm$ space group at 13~GPa. Above 19 GPa, the phase exhibits a clear superconducting transition, confirmed by a zero-resistance state, albeit at a significantly reduced temperature of 3.6 K. The stark contrast with the 80 K transition in the bilayer phase provides a uniquely clean experimental comparison. Our results demonstrate that the superconducting transition temperature is directly governed by the nature of the interlayer coupling, and the bilayer NiO$_6$ block as the essential structural motif for achieving high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductivity in the RP nickelates.

Title: Train Stochastic Non Linear Coupled ODEs to Classify and Generate
Authors: Stefano Gagliani, Feliciano Giuseppe Pacifico, Lorenzo Chicchi, Duccio Fanelli, Diego Febbe, Lorenzo Buffoni, Raffaele Marino
Abstract: A general class of dynamical systems which can be trained to operate in classification and generation modes are introduced. A procedure is proposed to plant asymptotic stationary attractors of the deterministic model. Optimizing the dynamical system amounts to shaping the architecture of inter-nodes connection to steer the evolution towards the assigned equilibrium, as a function of the class to which the item - supplied as an initial condition - belongs to. Under the stochastic perspective, point attractors are turned into probability distributions, made analytically accessible via the linear noise approximation. The addition of noise proves beneficial to oppose adversarial attacks, a property that gets engraved into the trained adjacency matrix and therefore also inherited by the deterministic counterpart of the optimized stochastic model. By providing samples from the target distribution as an input to a feedforward neural network (or even to a dynamical model of the same typology of the adopted for classification purposes), yields a fully generative scheme. Conditional generation is also possible by merging classification and generation modalities. Automatic disentanglement of isolated key features is finally proven.

Title: Geometric filtering effect in expanding Bose-Einstein condensate shells
Authors: Andrea Tononi, Maciej Lewenstein, Luis Santos
Abstract: A shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate released from its confinement expands radially both outwards and inwards, displaying a self-interference pattern characterized by a density peak surrounded by a halo. Here we analyze how an external imprinting or the thermal fluctuations of the condensate phase influence this expansion. In both cases, we find that the curved geometry filters the imploding finite angular-momentum modes via a radial centrifugal potential, so that only the condensate state can reach the origin and form the central peak. As a consequence, we observe a pronounced dependence of the central density on the imprinting strength and on temperature. This geometric filtering effect characterizes the free expansion of curved atomic gases in contrast with flat counterparts, it is easily observable in the available experimental platforms, and enables two-dimensional shells thermometry via simple absorption-imaging techniques.

Title: Generative Diffusion Model DiffCrysGen Discovers Rare Earth-Free Magnetic Materials
Authors: Sourav Mal, Nehad Ahmed, Subhankar Mishra, Prasenjit Sen
Abstract: Efficient exploration of the vast chemical space is a fundamental challenge in materials discovery, particularly for designing functional inorganic crystalline materials with targeted properties. Diffusion-based generative models have emerged as a powerful route, but most existing approaches require domain-specific constraints and separate diffusion processes for atom types, atomic positions, and lattice parameters, adding complexity and limiting efficiency. Here, we present DiffCrysGen, a fully data-driven, score-based diffusion model that generates complete crystal structures in a single, end-to-end diffusion process. This unified framework simplifies the model architecture and accelerates sampling by two to three orders of magnitude compared to existing methods without compromising chemical and structural diversity of the generated materials. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of DiffCrysGen in generating valid and useful materials, using density functional theory (DFT), we validate a number of newly generated rare earth-free magnetic materials that are energetically and dynamically stable, and are potentially synthesizable. These include ferromagnets with high saturation magnetization and large magnetocrystalline anisotropy, as also metallic antiferromagnets. These results establish DiffCrysGen as a general platform for accelerated functional materials discovery.

Title: Wiedemann-Franz behavior at the Weyl points in compressively strained HgTe
Authors: Abu Alex Aravindnath, Yi-Ju Ho, Fabian Schmitt, Dongyun Chen, Johannes Kleinlein, Wouter Beugeling, Hartmut Buhmann, Stanislau U. Piatrusha, Laurens W. Molenkamp
Abstract: Weyl semimetals, with their unique electronic band structure, have drawn significant interest for their potential to explore quantum anomalies in condensed matter systems. In this study, we investigate the large positive magneto-thermal conductance associated with the gravitational anomaly -- one of the predicted anomalies -- for a Weyl semimetal based on a compressively strained HgTe layer. We clearly identify the Weyl regime in our device and accurately extract the thermal conductance by performing thermometry measurements at liquid helium temperatures using fully electronic methods. We observe the anticipated increase in thermal conductance, and it perfectly matches the electrical conductance according to the Wiedemann-Franz law. This finding indicates that, despite the unique electronic spectrum of Weyl semimetals, the mechanism governing heat transport in this system is the same as that for electrical transport, with no additional violations of conservation laws.

Title: Two-Dimensional Altermagnetism in Epitaxial CrSb Ultrathin Films
Authors: Keren Li, Yuzhong Hu, Yue Li, Ruohang Xu, Heping Li, Kun Liu, Chen Liu, Jincheng Zhuang, Yee Sin Ang, Jiaou Wang, Haifeng Feng, Weichang Hao, Yi Du
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute an emerging class of collinear magnets that exhibit zero net magnetization yet host spin-split electronic bands arising from non-relativistic spin-space-group symmetries. Realization of altermagnetism in the two-dimensional (2D) limit remains an outstanding challenge because dimensional reduction suppresses kZ dispersion and destabilizes the symmetry operations essential for spin compensation. Here, we demonstrate genuine 2D altermagnetism in epitaxial unit-cell-thin films of CrSb grown on Bi2Te3. It reveals a thickness-driven transition from a ferrimagnetic state in 1-unit-cell films to an altermagnetic state above a critical thickness of 7/4 unit cell. The transition originates from interfacial symmetry breaking at the Cr-terminated layer that induces local moment imbalance. With increasing thickness the key spin-space-group symmetries [C2||C6Zt] and [C2||MZ] restores, which leads to altermagnetism with zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin splitting. Our results provide the first experimental realization of altermagnetism in the 2D regime and establish a route for integrating stray-field-free spin order into nanoscale spintronic architectures.

Title: $η$-pairing in the model with two-particle hybridization of conduction and localized electrons
Authors: Igor N. Karnaukhov
Abstract: Within the framework of a model, that takes into account two-particle hybridization of conduction and localized electrons, the effective interaction between conduction electrons is calculated. It is shown that this interaction is attractive when the energy of the localized electron corresponding to the two-particle state lies in the conduction band above the Fermi energy. The magnitude of the attractive interaction is minimal for $\eta$-paired states of conduction electrons. We generalize the original $\eta$-pairing construction for the proposed model and show that the superconducting state can indeed be realized.

Title: Interlayer coupling enhanced superconductivity near 100 K in La$_{3-x}$Nd$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$

Abstract: Systematically controlling the superconducting transition temperature ($T_\text{c}$) in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ remains a significant challenge. Here, we address this by synthesizing high-quality polycrystalline La$_{3-x}$Nd$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ($0 \leq x \leq 2.4$) with record-level rare-earth substitution. Nd doping compresses the lattice, particularly along the $c$ axis, enhances the spin density wave transition temperature, and elevates the pressure required for the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal structural transition. Superconductivity is observed across all doping levels under high pressures, with the onset $T_\text{c}$ rising to $\sim$93~K for $x = 2.1$ and $2.4$ from the electronic transport measurement. Using the radio-frequency transmission technique, newly applied to nickelate superconductors, we detect signatures of superconductivity at $98 \pm 2$~K in the $x=2.4$ compound, pushing the $T_\text{c}$ frontier further. We identify a universal linear relationship where $T_\text{c}$ decreases with the $c$-axis lattice parameter at a rate of approximately $-28$~K/Å, demonstrating that enhanced interlayer magnetic exchange coupling is the dominant mechanism for superconducting pairing. Our work establishes the critical role of magnetism and provides a unified structural descriptor for elevating $T_\text{c}$ in bilayer nickelates.

Title: Investigating the relationship between the Weyl semimetal phase and the three-dimensional quantum Hall phase in ZrTe$_5$
Authors: Jiahao Chen, Yu Cao, Hong Du, Yuanze Li, Ruidan Zhong, Tian Liang
Abstract: The material ZrTe$_5$ exhibits distinct topological phases, including a Weyl semimetal phase, characterized by a chiral anomaly and in-plane Hall effect, and a three-dimensional quantum Hall phase. The relationship between these phases remains poorly understood. This work systematically explores their connection in ZrTe$_5$ through rotatable, pressure-dependent measurements. At ambient pressure, both phases are observed; the WSM phase requires strong electronic polarization, while the 3D QH phase appears when the characteristic resistivity peak temperature $T_p$ is approximately 90 K. Under applied pressure, the polarization diminishes, weakening the WSM phase and its associated nontrivial Hall signals. Concurrently, $T_p$ rises dramatically from 2 K at ambient pressure to 70 K at 2.2 GPa, approaching the expected regime for the 3D QH phase. These findings clarify the conditions underlying the WSM and 3D QH phases and suggest that exploring the 3D QH phase at even higher pressures is a promising direction for future research.

Title: Controlling Magnetism in the 2D van der Waals Antiferromagnet CrPS$_4$ via Ion Intercalation
Authors: Alberto M. Ruiz, Diego López-Alcalá, Gonzalo Rivero-Carracedo, Andrei Shumilin, José J. Baldoví
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials are versatile platforms for tailoring electronic and magnetic properties, in which the insertion of chemical species into their interlayer gaps offers a powerful route to engineer magnetism. Here, we focus on the A-type antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS$_4$ (T$_N$ = 38 K) and investigate its electronic and magnetic properties upon intercalation of lithium (Li$^+$) and organic tetrabutylammonium (TBA$^+$) ions using first-principles calculations. Our results show that Li$^+$ incorporation induces a semiconductor-to-metal transition in CrPS$_4$ and selectively modifies its magnetic behaviour: switching from out-of-plane to in-plane antiferromagnetism, followed by an in-plane ferromagnetic ground state at higher intercalation levels. This is accompanied by a continuous increase of the ordering temperature, reaching a fivefold enhancement for Li$_{0.5}$CrPS$_4$. Similarly, TBA$^+$ intercalation expands the vdW gap, decoupling CrPS$_4$ layers and stabilising in-plane ferromagnetism with a T$_C$ above 100 K. Furthermore, it also modifies magnon propagation, leading to enhanced group velocities and a more isotropic magnon transport. This work highlights intercalation as a powerful and versatile approach for controlling magnetic behaviour and spin dynamics, paving the way for the design of tunable 2D layered magnetic materials for spintronic and magnonic applications.

Title: From empty to filled vortices in squeezed 39K Bose-Bose liquid drops
Authors: Ivan Poparić, Leandra Vranješ Markić, Jordi Boronat
Abstract: Using density functional theory, we have theoretically studied the formation and the stability of vortices in quantum liquid droplets composed of a mixture of hyperfine states of potassium. Following the experimental setup that produced quantum droplets for the first time, we work with squeezed drops that are compressed in one direction. By squeezing the drops even more, towards a quasi-two dimensional geometry, we study the minimum atom number able to show a stable vortex and obtain that this number is significantly smaller than previous predictions for spherical droplets. The reduction of the critical atom number for forming a stable vortex could make their experimental observation in these droplets, which is still lacking, more feasible. Contrary to results obtained in heteronuclear mixtures, where the energetically preferred vortices are partially filled with the species not participating in the rotation, our results show a relevant stability island of fully empty vortices. Increasing the number of particles in the drop and the speed of rotation, we estimate the transition line between empty and filled vortices.

Title: Defect Passivation and Förster-Type Energy Exchange in H2Pc-TMD Organic-Inorganic Heterostructures
Authors: Šimun Mandić, Ana Senkić, Nataša Vujičić
Abstract: Organic - inorganic heterostructures (HS) combine the strong light absorption and exciton generation capabilities of organic molecules with the unique excitonic properties of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), where the interfacial band alignment dictates the optical response. In this work, we investigate the influence of H2Pc molecules on CVD-grown MoS2 and WS2 monolayers using correlative microscopy techniques - Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), photoluminescence (PL), and Raman spectroscopy. Comprehensive analysis of both electronic and optical properties provides detailed insights into the energy band alignment in these two HS. Despite their similar band alignments, the heterostructures exhibit strikingly different optical signatures. In the case of H2Pc/MoS2 HS, the effect of defect healing is more pronounced, while for the H2Pc/WS2 HS, strong indications of Förster energy transfer are observed. These findings highlight the critical role of transition dipole moment in addition to spectral overlap between donor emission and acceptor absorption in the design of optoelectronic devices.

Title: Self-attention enabled quantum path analysis of high-harmonic generation in solids
Authors: Cong Zhao, Xiaozhou Zou
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids provides a powerful platform to probe ultrafast electron dynamics and interband--intraband coupling. However, disentangling the complex many-body contributions in the HHG spectrum remains challenging. Here we introduce a machine-learning approach based on a Transformer encoder to analyze and reconstruct HHG signals computed from a one-dimensional Kronig--Penney model. The self-attention mechanism inherently highlights correlations between temporal dipole dynamics and high-frequency spectral components, allowing us to identify signatures of nonadiabatic band coupling that are otherwise obscured in standard Fourier analysis. By combining attention maps with Gabor time--frequency analysis, we extract and amplify weak coupling channels that contribute to even-order harmonics and anomalous spectral features. Our results demonstrate that multi-head self-attention acts as a selective filter for strong-coupling events in the time domain, enabling a physics-informed interpretation of high-dimensional quantum dynamics. This work establishes Transformer-based attention as a versatile tool for solid-state strong-field physics, opening new possibilities for interpretable machine learning in attosecond spectroscopy and nonlinear photonics.

Title: Two-Dimensional Na2LiAlP2 crystal for high-performance field-effect transistors
Authors: Run-Jie Peng, Xing-Yu Wang, Jun-Hui Yuan, Nian-Nian Yu, Kan-Hao Xue, Jiafu Wang, Pan Zhang
Abstract: High-performance, low-power transistors are core components of advanced integrated circuits, and the ultimate limitation of Moore's law has made the search for new alternative pathways an urgent priority. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have become the most promising exploration target due to their exceptional electronic properties and scalability. In this work, we conducted device transport research on the previously proposed 2D quaternary semiconductor Na2LiAlP2 using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. The results demonstrate that even with a channel length of 5.7 nm, Na2LiAlP2 still exhibits excellent n-type transistor characteristics, fully meeting and surpassing the technical specifications outlined in the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS). Encouragingly, the device can easily achieve the required on-state current of 900 {\mu}A/{\mu}m under low operating voltages of 0.1 V and 0.2 V. Moreover, at 0.1 V operating voltage, the device's subthreshold swing breaks through the theoretical limit of 60 mV/dec, reaching an astonishing value 30.33 mV/dec. Additionally, its p-type transistor performance also stands out with a subthreshold swing of ~50 mV/dec when the channel length is 7.9 nm. Our research not only showcases the exceptional transistor properties of Na2LiAlP2 but also further expands the research scope of 2D high-performance transistors.

Title: Green's function expansion for multiple coupled optical resonators with finite retardation using quasinormal modes
Authors: Robert Fuchs, Juanjuan Ren, Stephen Hughes, Marten Richter
Abstract: The electromagnetic Green's function is a crucial ingredient for the theoretical study of modern photonic quantum devices, but is often difficult or even impossible to calculate directly. We present a numerically efficient framework for calculating the scattered electromagnetic Green's function of a multi-cavity system with spatially separated open cavities (with arbitrary shape, dispersion and loss) and finite retardation times. The framework is based on a Dyson scattering equation that enables the construction of the Green's function from the quasinormal modes of the individual resonators within a few-mode approximation and a finite number of iteration steps without requiring nested integrals. The approach shows excellent agreement with the full numerical Green's function for the example of two coupled dipoles located in the gaps of two metal dimers serving as quasinormal mode cavities, and is easily extended to arbitrarily large separations and multiple cavities.

Title: Anharmonic Effects in Ge2Sb2Te5 and Consequences on Thermodynamic Stability
Authors: Owain T. Beynon, Adham Hashibon
Abstract: Chalcogenide materials are an important class of phase change material (PCMs) owing to their employment in digital memory solutions. Chalgogenide materials have applications in phase change random access memory (PCRAM) due to their ability to reversibly cycle between crystalline and amorphous states, and of these materials Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) is of particular interest due to its speed, stability and low crystallisation temperatures. GST possesses two stable crystalline polymorphs, cubic and hexagonal (trigonal system). Studies show that phenomena such as heat transport and thermal lattice expansion drive the phase-change nature of these materials. These phenomena are not incorporated in the harmonic approximation, which is a popular model for describing vibrations in solids. Through ab initio density functional theory (DFT), we computationally investigate the anharmonic behaviour of pristine GST, without vacancies or defects, while considering the various stacking models that exist and inclusion of van der Waals (vdW) interactions in our modelling. We present the vibrational analysis of different stacking models in GST; Petrov and Kooi-De Hosson (KDH) models and the quantification anharmonic behaviour. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating anharmonic and dispersion effects when modelling GST, especially in the choice of stacking models, along with implications for phenomena relating to phase-change behaviour.

Title: Origin of Enhanced Thermal Resistance Near Nanoscale Hotspots: Insights from Full-Dispersion-Resolved Phonon Transport in Silicon
Authors: Jae Sik Jin
Abstract: Phonon transport near nanoscale hotspots (NHs) critically determines heat dissipation in advanced electronic devices. The prevailing understanding is that the enhanced thermal resistance (TR) observed in NHs originates from long mean free path (MFP) phonons, whose MFPs are much larger than the hotspot size, thereby limiting their ability to recognize hotspots and transport heat effectively. In this study, we revisit this problem by employing the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with a full phonon dispersion model (FPDM) to capture mode-resolved velocities, scattering processes, and nonequilibrium phonon populations in silicon. The analysis demonstrates that the increase in TR near NHs is not caused by the long MFP itself but by the low specific heat of long-MFP phonons that do not scatter directly with optical modes. These phonons heat readily when energy is supplied, steepening the local temperature gradient near the NH and thereby enhancing TR. By resolving the spectral contributions to the phonon transport resistance and temperature gradients, we identify the critical role of the modal specific heat in nonlocal phonon transport. These results provide new physical insights into nanoscale thermal management and highlight the importance of spectral mode resolution in modeling heat dissipation in electronic devices.

Title: Conductance Plateaus at Quantum Hall Integer Filling Factors in Germanium Quantum Point Contacts
Authors: Karina Hudson, Davide Costa, Davide Degli Esposti, Lucas E. A. Stehouwer, Giordano Scappucci
Abstract: Constricting transport through a one-dimensional quantum point contact in the quantum Hall regime enables gate-tunable selection of the edge modes propagating between voltage probe electrodes. Here we investigate the quantum Hall effect in a quantum point contact fabricated on low disorder strained germanium quantum wells. For increasing magnetic field, we observe Zeeman spin-split 1D ballistic hole transport evolving to integer quantum Hall states, with well-defined quantised conductance increasing in multiples of $e^2/h$ down to the first integer filling factor $\nu=1$. These results establish strained germanium as a viable platform for complex experiments probing many-body states and quantum phase transitions.

Title: Anonymous leadership and stochastic resonance in collectives of self-propelled robots
Authors: Manuel Dizenhaus, Franco De Simone, German A. Patterson
Abstract: We investigate the influence of an anonymous leader on a collective of self-propelled robots using Kilobot experiments and numerical simulations. A single leader alternated deterministically between clockwise and counterclockwise motion, while the other robots followed a stochastic majority rule. Although the leader does not change global order, it induces correlations with the collective response that peak at intermediate perturbation levels, resembling stochastic resonance. Simulations confirm that this resonance occurs when the leader's reversal period matches the mean residence time of the unperturbed system. Our results contribute to understanding decision-making in active matter and suggesting principles for steering robotic swarms with minimal leadership input.

Title: Escape-Induced Temporally Correlated Noise Driven Universality Crossover

Abstract: Universal behavior in far-from-equilibrium systems is driven by interactions between transport processes and noise structure. The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) framework predicts that extensions incorporating conserved currents or temporally correlated noise give rise to distinct growth morphologies and universality classes, yet direct experimental realization has remained elusive. Here, we report atomically resolved Sn thin-film growth on Sb-doped MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, revealing a sharp dynamical crossover between two fundamentally different regimes. Early stage growth follows conserved KPZ scaling, forming two-dimensional islands and stanene layers. Beyond a critical deposition time, temporally correlated noise dominates, driving the nucleation of $\alpha$ -Sn clusters, their evolution into faceted grains, and coexistence with faceted $\beta$-Sn. Molecular dynamics simulation and Auger electron spectroscopy show adatom escape as the microscopic origin of temporally correlated noise, providing a microscopic mechanism for the universality crossover. These findings establish, for the first time, that temporal noise correlations can fundamentally alter the scaling class of a growing interface, linking atomistic kinetics to emergent universal behavior.

Title: Quantum thermodynamics of Gross-Pitaevskii qubits
Authors: Sebastian Deffner
Abstract: What are the resources that can be leveraged for a thermodynamic device to exhibit genuine quantum advantage? Typically, the answer to this question is sought in quantum correlations. In the present work, we show that quantum Otto engines that operate with nonlinear qubits significantly outperform linear engines. To this end, we develop a comprehensive thermodynamic description of nonlinear qubits starting with identifying the proper thermodynamic equilibrium state. We then show that for ideal cycles as well as at maximum power the efficiency of the nonlinear engine is significantly higher. Interestingly, nonlinear dynamics can be thought of as an effective description of a correlated, complex quantum many body system. Hence, our findings corroborate common wisdom, while at the same time propose a new design of more efficient quantum engines.

Title: The spin Hall conductivity in the hole-doped bilayer Haldane-Hubbard model with odd-parity ALM
Authors: Minghuan Zeng, Ling Qin, Shiping Feng, Dong-Hui Xu, Rui Wang
Abstract: Spin current generated electrically is among the core phenomena of spintronics for driving high-performance spin device applications. Here, on the basis of systematic investigations for the hole doped single-layer Haldane-Hubbard(HH) model, we propose a new bilayer HH model to realize the compensated odd-parity spin splitting and the $T$-even spin Hall conductivity where the two layers are connected by the time reversal transformation. Our results show that the vanishing layer-dependent electric potential $V_{L}$ gives rise to odd-parity ALM protected by the combined symmetry $TM_{xy}$ with $T$ and $M_{xy}$ being the time reversal and mirror reflection perpendicular to $z$ axis, and the $T$-even spin Hall conductivity simultaneously. In addition, though the staggered magnetization within each layer is substantially impacted by the layer-dependent electric potential, small $V_{L}$'s only bring negligible changes to the net magnetization and the spin Hall conductivity, indicating that the alternating spin splitting in momentum space and the spin Hall conductivity are insusceptible to external elements. Most importantly, our work provides a general framework for the simultaneous realization of the compensated odd-parity spin splitting in momentum space and the spin Hall conductivity in collinear magnets, in terms of stacked multi-layer systems.

Title: Dissipationless transport by design in ultrathin magnetic topological insulator films
Authors: Amir Sabzalipour, Mohammad Shafiei, Milorad V. Milošević
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) are among the prominent platforms for the next generation of high-speed and low-power spintronic devices. However, unlike their non-magnetic counterparts, where the surface spin-momentum locking prevents electrons from being scattered by non-magnetic impurities and results in a dissipationless electronic flow, magnetic impurities in MTIs cause dissipation by exerting magnetic torque on the electron spin. Decreasing this resistance is desired to reduce energy consumption and optimize performance of MTIs in envisaged applications. Here we reveal how electronic backscattering can be suppressed in a MTI thin film by external magnetic and/or electronic stimuli, to yield an entirely dissipationless spin-polarized charge transport. Our findings thus present an effective route to preserve spin coherence and enhance spin-current functionality in magnetic topological materials, suggesting design strategies for magneto-electronic and spintronic devices with strongly reduced energy consumption.

Title: Quantum Spin Singlet and Classical Néel-Ordered Ground States in MoX3 (X = I, Br) Spin-3/2 Dimerized Antiferromagnetic Chain Crystals
Authors: Jordan Teeter, Topojit Debnath, Harshil Goyal, Md Sabbir Hossen Bijoy, Maedeh Taheri, Nicholas Sesing, Fariborz Kargar, Kirill Shtengel, Tina Salguero, Roger K. Lake, Alexander A. Balandin
Abstract: We report that MoX3 (X = I, Br) are rare van der Waals materials that exhibit signatures of both quantum spin chains with a spin singlet ground state and classical Neel order. Bulk single crystals grown by chemical vapor transport exhibit classical antiferromagnetic ground states with a transition temperature of ~40 K as revealed by susceptibility and specific heat measurements. Above 40 K, the susceptibilities show the large, broad peaks associated with a quantum spin-singlet ground state and large singlet-triplet gaps of 21 meV and 25 meV. Monte Carlo simulations, density matrix renormalization-group calculations for finite spin-3/2 chains, and density functional theory reproduce the experimental behavior, confirming the interplay between strong one-dimensional intrachain and weak three-dimensional interchain couplings. MoX3 offers a unique platform for exploring quantum magnetism and magnetic excitations at the atomic chain limit, as these materials combine a 1D van der Waals motif, spin chain behavior, and classical interchain order.

Title: AI-Assisted Physics-Informed Predictions of Degradation Behavior of Polymeric Anion Exchange Membranes
Authors: William Schertzer, Mohamed Al Otmi, Janani Sampath, Ryan P. Lively, Rampi Ramprasad
Abstract: The global transition to hydrogen-based energy infrastructures faces significant hurdles. Chief among these are the high costs and sustainability issues associated with acid-based proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Anion exchange membrane (AEM) fuel cells offer promising cost-effective alternatives, yet their widespread adoption is limited by rapid degradation in alkaline environments. Here, we develop a framework that integrates mechanistic insights with machine learning, enabling the identification of generalized degradation behavior across diverse polymeric AEM chemistries and operating conditions. Our model successfully predicts long-term hydroxide conductivity degradation (up to 10,000 hours) from minimal early-time experimental data. This capability significantly reduces experimental burdens and may expedite the design of high-performance, durable AEM materials.

Title: The anisotropic Heisenberg model close to the Ising limit: triangular lattice vs. effective models
Authors: Martin Ulaga, Jure Kokalj, Takami Tohyama, Peter Prelovšek
Abstract: Stimulated by recent experiments on materials representing the realization of the anisotropic Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ model on the triangular lattice, we explore further properties of such a model in the easy-axis regime $\alpha = J_\perp/J_z < 1$, as well as effective models that also capture such physics. We show that anisotropic Heisenberg models on the honeycomb lattice and even on the square lattice reveal similarities to the full triangular lattice in the magnetization curve as well as in the transverse magnetization (superfluid) order parameter $m_\perp$ at finite fields. Still, at $\alpha \ll 1$, results reveal gapless excitations and small but finite $m_\perp >0 $ at effective fields corresponding to the triangular case without the field. In contrast, several additional numerical studies of the full model on the triangular lattice confirm the existence of the gap at $\alpha \ll 1$. In particular, the magnetization curve $m(h)$ as well as the spin stiffness $\rho_s$ indicate (at zero field) a transition/crossover from gapped to gapless regime at $\alpha \sim \alpha^*$ with $\alpha^* \lesssim 0.5$. We also show that deviations from the linear spin-wave theory and the emergence of the gap can be traced back to the strong effective repulsion between magnon excitations, having similarity to strongly correlated systems.

Title: The Popkov-Schütz two-lane lattice gas: Universality for general jump rates
Authors: Herbert Spohn
Abstract: We consider the asymmetric version of the Popkov-Schütz two-lane lattice gas with general jump rates, subject to the stationary measure being of product form. This still leaves five free parameters. At density $\tfrac{1}{2}$ the eigenvalues of the flux Jacobian are degenerate. We compute the second order expansion of the average fluxes at density $\tfrac{1}{2}$ and thereby identify the universality classes.

Title: Possible Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons in a S = 5/2 honeycomb lattice
Authors: J. Khatua, S. M. Kumawat, G. Senthil Murugan, C.-L. Huang, Heung-Sik Kim, K. Sritharan, R. Sankar, Kwang-Yong Choi
Abstract: Quantum magnets offer a unique platform for exploring exotic quantum phases and quantum phase transitions through external magnetic fields. A prominent example is the field-induced Bose--Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnons near the saturation field. While this behavior has been observed in low-spin systems, its realization in high-spin, quasi-two-dimensional magnets -- where multiple on-site excitations are possible -- remains exceptionally rare. Here, we report thermodynamic and density functional theory results on single crystals of the honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnet K$_{4}$MnMo$_{4}$O$_{15}$ with $S = 5/2$. The system undergoes a field-induced transition to a fully polarized state at the critical field $\mu_{0}H_{\rm s} = 6.4$~T. Our results reveal possible thermodynamic signatures of magnon BEC, $T_{\mathrm{N}} \sim (H_{\rm s} - H)^{2/d}$ ($d = 3$), expanding the purview of BEC-driven quantum criticality to a high-spin, quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnets with negligibly small anisotropy.

Title: Formation of C-centers in Si-based systems by light ion irradiation
Authors: Carolina Crosta, Riccardo Nardin, Patrick Daoust, Stefano Achilli, Ian Colombo, Matteo Campostrini, Emiliano Bonera, Jacopo Pedrini, Oussama Moutanabbir, Valentino Rigato, Fabio Pezzoli
Abstract: Atomic-scale crystal defects in Si are quantum-light sources offering tantalizing integration with existing photonic technologies. Yet, the controlled creation of near-infrared color centers for long- haul quantum communication and information still remains a challenge. In this work, we utilize light ions, such as H+ and He+, to gently generate quantum emitters in a crystalline Si matrix. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements demonstrate the presence of optically-active defects, whose fluorescence matches the primary telecom window around 1550 nm. In addition, time-resolved investigations unveil long-lived excitonic states in the {\mu}s regime, thus confirming the formation of interstitial oxygen-carbon complexes, termed C-centers. Finally, we explored controlled ion irradiation strategies to seamlessly generate C-centers also in Ge-on-Si heterostructures, which offer an advanced technological platform for the future realization of integrated quantum photonics. This analysis, informed by practical color center synthesis and proof-of-principle experiments in epitaxial architectures, indicates intriguing prospects and profitable strategies to advance the burgeoning field of light-based quantum technologies.

Title: Temperature and conditions for thermalization after canonical quenches
Authors: Lennart Dabelow
Abstract: We consider quenches of a quantum system that is prepared in a canonical equilibrium state of one Hamiltonian and then evolves unitarily in time under a different Hamiltonian. Technically, our main result is a systematic expansion of the pre- and post-quench canonical ensembles in the quench strength. We first demonstrate how this can be used to predict the system's temperature after the quench from equilibrium properties at the pre-quench temperature. For a thermalizing post-quench system, it furthermore allows us to calculate equilibrium observable expectation values. Finally, in the presence of additional conserved quantities besides the Hamiltonian, we obtain a hierarchy of necessary conditions for thermalization towards the (post-quench) canonical ensemble. At first order, these thermalization conditions have a nice geometric interpretation in operator space with the canonical covariance as a semi-inner product: The quench operator (difference between post- and pre-quench Hamiltonians) and the conserved quantity must be orthogonal in the orthogonal complement of the post-quench Hamiltonian. We illustrate the results numerically for a variety of setups involving integrable and nonintegrable models.

Title: Switchable chiral 2x2 pair density wave in pure CsV3Sb5
Authors: Wei Song, Xiao-Yu Yan, Xin Yu, Desheng Wu, Deng Hu, Hailang Qin, Guowei Liu, Hanbin Deng, Chao Yan. Muwei Gao, Zhiwei Wang, Rui Wu, Jia-Xin Yin
Abstract: We investigate electron pairing in a super clean kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 with a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of 290. By using the dilution-refrigerator-based scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at the Synergetic Extreme Condition User Facility (SECUF), we find that the pairing gap exhibits chiral 2x2 modulations, and their chirality can be controlled by magnetic field training. We introduce nonmagnetic impurities to observe the complete suppression of 2x2 pairing modulations in presence of persistent 2x2 charge order. This nonmagnetic pair-breaking effect provides phase-sensitive evidence for pair-density-wave (PDW) induced pairing modulations. Our results support switchable chiral 2x2 PDW in this super clean kagome superconductor.

Title: plasmonX: an Open-Source Code for Nanoplasmonics
Authors: Tommaso Giovannini, Pablo Grobas Illobre, Piero Lafiosca, Luca Nicoli, Luca Bonatti, Stefano Corni, Chiara Cappelli
Abstract: We present the first public release of plasmonX, a novel open-source code for simulating the plasmonic response of complex nanostructures. The code supports both fully atomistic and implicit descriptions of nanomaterials. In particular, it employs the frequency-dependent fluctuating charges ($\omega$FQ) and dipoles ($\omega$FQF$\mu$) models to describe the response properties of atomistic structures, including simple and $d$-metals, graphene-based structures, and multi-metal nanostructures. For implicit representations, the Boundary Element Method is implemented in both the dielectric polarizable continuum model (DPCM) and integral equation formalism (IEF-PCM) variants. The distribution also includes a post-processing module that enables analysis of electric field-induced properties such as charge density and electric field patterns.

Title: Oxygen-vacancy-induced Raman softening in the catalyst Fe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$
Authors: Young-Joon Song, Roser Valentí
Abstract: Although iron molybdate (Fe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$) has been commercially utilized for the production of formaldehyde from methanol via oxidative dehydrogenation, the detailed mechanism during the catalytic process remains unclear. Recent operando Raman and impedance measurements of the reaction suggested that the bulk region of Fe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$ acts as a reservoir of oxygen atoms that can migrate to the surface to participate in catalysis. This conclusion was drawn from the observed significant reduction in Raman intensity during the catalytic process which implies the formation of atomic defects. However, the microscopic origin of this reduction remains to be clarified. In this work, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the origin of the experimentally observed Raman intensity variation. Our phonon analysis reveals that oxygen-dominated vibrational modes, with a small Mo contribution, occur near 782 cm$^{-1}$-the same frequency region where the Raman intensity reduction was measured. Using an effective frozen-phonon approach, we further demonstrate that oxygen vibrations are primarily responsible for the decrease in calculated Raman intensity. Moreover, structural relaxation of Fe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$ including an oxygen vacancy suggests that oxygen diffusion from the bulk to the surface should occur without significant alteration of the local symmetry, consistent with the absence of measurable peak shifts or broadening in the experimental Raman spectra.

Title: Two-Dimensional Altermagnetic Iron Oxyhalides: Real Chern topology and Valley-Spin-Lattice coupling
Authors: Yong-Kun Wang, Si Li, Shengyuan A. Yang
Abstract: Altermagnets, a novel class of collinear magnetic materials, exhibit unique spin-split band structures, yet topological insulating states in intrinsic altermagnetic systems are rare. Here, we identify monolayer Fe$_2X_2$O ($X$ = Cl, Br, I) as a new family of 2D altermagnetic real Chern insulators. These materials display robust $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering, semiconducting band gaps, and nontrivial real Chern numbers per spin channel, yielding spin-polarized topological corner modes. They also feature spin-polarized valleys with strong altermagnetism-valley-spin-lattice coupling, enabling valley-selective excitation via linear dichroism and strain-induced valley polarization. In multiferroic Fe$_2$Cl$_2$O, magnetism coexists with ferroelasticity, and an applied strain can switche the Néel vector. These findings position 2D iron oxyhalides as a promising platform for exploring altermagnetism and magnetic topological states for spintronics and valleytronics.

Title: Kibble-Zurek Scaling and Spatial Statistics in Quenched Binary Bose Superfluids
Authors: Subhadeep Patra, Arko Roy, Seong-Ho Shinn, Adolfo del Campo, Mithun Thudiyangal
Abstract: We study how gradually changing the chemical potential causes a two-dimensional binary Bose gas to condense from vacuum to finite density, resulting in either a mixed (miscible) or separated (immiscible) state depending on interaction strengths. In the immiscible case, random domains form, and their number, boundary length, and average size at the point of equilibration follow universal Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling with the cooling rate. These patterns continue to evolve in a self-similar way while maintaining KZ scaling. In the miscible regime, instead of domains, vortices appear, following the KZ scaling. The spatial distribution of domains and vortices is described by a Poisson point process with the KZ density. These findings highlight robust, universal features of how binary superfluids behave far from equilibrium, extending beyond the KZ theory.

Title: Quantum criticality at the end of a pseudogap phase in superconducting infinite-layer nickelates
Authors: C. Iorio-Duval, E. Beauchesne-Blanchet, F. Perreault, J. L. Santana González, W. Sun, Y. F. Nie, A. Gourgout, G. Grissonnanche
Abstract: In many unconventional superconductors, the strange-metal regime is thought to emerge from quantum criticality, yet in cuprates this link is obscured by the enigmatic pseudogap. Superconducting infinite-layer nickelates provide a new arena to test this paradigm but are constrained to thin films, precluding calorimetry. We use the Seebeck coefficient as a low-temperature proxy for entropy per carrier and uncover a clear quantum-critical thermodynamic signature: in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at the onset of $T$-linear resistivity ($x=0.20$), $S/T$ diverges logarithmically upon cooling, $S/T \propto \log T$. Boltzmann transport based on ARPES-derived band structure reproduces the high-temperature magnitude and sign of $S/T$ and reveals a threefold mass renormalization at the Fermi level. To identify the terminating phase, we analyze Hall data across Nd$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ and show that its temperature evolution is quantitatively captured by a minimal two-band model in which a strongly correlated Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ Fermi surface exhibits Planckian $T$-linear scattering while the rare-earth Nd-$s$ pocket remains Fermi-liquid-like. Inverting the zero-temperature Hall response reveals a collapse of the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band carrier density from $1+p$ to $p$ holes across the critical doping, without long-range magnetic order -- mirroring the cuprate pseudogap transition in cuprates. These results establish a quantum critical point at the end of a pseudogap-like phase in infinite-layer nickelates and unify the broader paradigm among correlated superconductors that strange metal behaviour is intimately linked to quantum criticality.

Title: Broad nonlocal spectrum in the Pb-InSb hybrid three terminals for potential realization of Kitaev chains

Nowak, Paweł Wójcik, Ziwei Dou, Erik P. A. M. Bakkers, Li Lu, Jie Shen
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor(SC-SM) nanowires remain one of the foremost platforms for engineering topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes(MZMs) towards fault-tolerant topological qubits, especially with the rapid development of artificial Kitaev chains. In contrast to the widely used aluminum(Al)-based hybrids, lead(Pb) offers a bulk superconducting gap of ~1.4meV and a critical temperature of ~7.2K, giving rise to a proximity-induced gap that is roughly five times larger than that obtained with Al. Here we present the first three-terminal Pb-hybrid devices and perform nonlocal differential-conductance spectroscopy on this platform. The nonlocal measurement simultaneously resolves a dual-gap feature of the parent Pb gap and the large, hard, gate-tunable induced superconducting gap, distinguished by a switch between electron- and hole-like dissipation processes. Within the induced gap we observe several types of Andreev bound states(ABSs) that undergo singlet-doublet transitions. Moreover, by tuning gate voltages we achieve gate-controlled resonating sign reversals of the nonlocal conductance, identifying three distinct regimes that correspond to different configurations of quantum-dot(QD) resonances(single-resonance, double-resonance, and series-resonance). Finally, the coupling between ABSs and QDs also present and can be modulated from the weak- to strong-coupling limit, indicating the feasibility of realizing the artificial Kitaev chains. Crucially, the robust nonlocal signatures persist up to temperatures(~1K) far above the operating temperature of Al-based devices thanks to the unusually large induced gap, thereby widening the accessible parameter space greatly and underscoring the suitability of Pb-based hybrids for implementing warm temperature artificial Kitaev chains and the topological quantum devices protected by a substantially larger topological gap.

Title: Error thresholds of toric codes with transversal logical gates
Authors: Yichen Xu, Yiqing Zhou, James P. Sethna, Eun-Ah Kim
Abstract: The threshold theorem promises a path to fault-tolerant quantum computation by suppressing logical errors, provided the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. While transversal gates offer an efficient method for implementing logical operations, they risk spreading errors and potentially lowering this threshold compared to a static quantum memory. Available threshold estimates for transversal circuits are empirically obtained and limited to specific, sub-optimal decoders. To establish rigorous bounds on the negative impact of error spreading by the transversal gates, we generalize the statistical mechanical (stat-mech) mapping from quantum memories to logical circuits. We establish a mapping for two toric code blocks that undergo a transversal CNOT (tCNOT) gate. Using this mapping, we quantify the impact of two independent error-spreading mechanisms: the spread of physical bit-flip errors and the spread of syndrome errors. In the former case, the stat-mech model is a 2D random Ashkin-Teller model. We use numerical simulation to show that the tCNOT gate reduces the optimal bit-flip error threshold to $p=0.080$, a $26\%$ decrease from the toric code memory threshold $p=0.109$. The case of syndrome error coexisting with bit-flip errors is mapped to a 3D random 4-body Ising model with a plane defect. There, we obtain a conservative estimate error threshold of $p=0.028$, implying an even more modest reduction due to the spread of the syndrome error compared to the memory threshold $p=0.033$. Our work establishes that an arbitrary transversal Clifford logical circuit can be mapped to a stat-mech model, and a rigorous threshold can be obtained correspondingly.

Title: Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization with Human-in-the-Loop for Flexible Neuromorphic Electronics Fabrication
Authors: Benius Dunn, Javier Meza-Arroyo, Armi Tiihonen, Mark Lee, Julia W. P. Hsu
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing hardware enables edge computing and can be implemented in flexible electronics for novel applications. Metal oxide materials are promising candidates for fabricating flexible neuromorphic electronics, but suffer from processing constraints due to the incompatibilities between oxides and polymer substrates. In this work, we use photonic curing to fabricate flexible metal-insulator-metal capacitors with solution-processible aluminum oxide dielectric tailored for neuromorphic applications. Because photonic curing outcomes depend on many input parameters, identifying an optimal processing condition through a traditional grid-search approach is unfeasible. Here, we apply multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to determine photonic curing conditions that optimize the trade-off between desired electrical properties of large capacitance-frequency dispersion and low leakage current. Furthermore, we develop a human-in-the-loop (HITL) framework for incorporating failed experiments into the MOBO machine learning workflow, demonstrating that this framework accelerates optimization by reducing the number of experimental rounds required. Once optimization is concluded, we analyze different Pareto-optimal conditions to tune the dielectrics properties and provide insight into the importance of different inputs through Shapley Additive exPlanations analysis. The demonstrated framework of combining MOBO with HITL feedback can be adapted to a wide range of multi-objective experimental problems that have interconnected inputs and high experimental failure rates to generate usable results for machine learning models.

Title: Wireless Sensing of Temperature, Strain and Crack Growth in 3D-Printed Metal Structures via Magnetoelastic and Thermomagnetic Inclusions
Authors: Connor G. McMahan, Gavin Chang, Raymond Nguyen, Souren Soukiazian, David A. Smith, Tobias Schaedler, David Shahan
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate the first realization of wireless strain and temperature sensing within 3D-printed metallic structures using standard electromagnetic inspection hardware. This establishes a path toward need-based parts maintenance driven by accurate damage assessments instead of relying on regularly scheduled maintenance teardowns, extending the service intervals of structures operating in harsh environments. To this end, we encapsulate magnetoelastic and thermomagnetic materials inside microtubes and embed the sensing elements during additive manufacturing. Mechanical and thermal stimuli affect the magnetic permeability of the embedded materials, which modulates the impedance of a coil placed on or near the surface of the printed part. We demonstrate strain sensing accurate to +/-27x10-6 over at least a 6x10-4 strain range, and temperature sensing accurate to +/-0.75oC over a 70oC range, both to a 95% confidence interval. We highlight these sensors' capabilities by detecting the onset of plasticity and fatigue-driven crack growth thousands of cycles before critical failure. This extends non-destructive eddy-current damage detection to accurate, real-time strain and temperature monitoring within metallic structures.

Title: Advanced creep modelling for polymers: A variable-order fractional calculus approach
Authors: José Geraldo Telles Ribeiro, Americo Cunha Jr
Abstract: Polymer-based plastics exhibit time-dependent deformation under constant stress, known as creep, which can lead to rupture or static fatigue. A common misconception is that materials under tolerable static loads remain unaffected over time. Accurate long-term deformation predictions require experimental creep data, but conventional models based on simple rheological elements like springs and dampers often fall short, lacking the flexibility to capture the power-law behaviour intrinsic to creep processes. The springpot, a fractional calculus-based element, has been used to provide a power-law relationship; however, its fixed-order nature limits its accuracy, particularly when the deformation rate evolves over time. This article introduces a variable-order (VO) springpot model that dynamically adapts to the evolving viscoelastic properties of polymeric materials during creep, capturing changes between glassy, transition and rubbery phases. Model parameters are calibrated using a robust procedure for model identification based on the cross-entropy (CE) method, resulting in physically consistent and accurate predictions. This advanced modelling framework not only overcomes the limitations of the fixed-order models but also establishes a foundation for applying VO mechanics to other viscoelastic materials, providing a valuable tool for predicting long-term material performance in structural applications.

Title: Bound on entanglement in neural quantum states
Authors: Nisarga Paul
Abstract: Variational wavefunctions offer a practical route around the exponential complexity of many-body Hilbert spaces, but their expressive power is often sharply constrained. Matrix product states, for instance, are efficient but limited to area law entangled states. Neural quantum states (NQS) are widely believed to overcome such limitations, yet little is known about their fundamental constraints. Here we prove that feed-forward neural quantum states acting on $n$ spins with $k$ scalar nonlinearities, under certain analyticity assumptions, obey a bound on entanglement entropy for any subregion: $S \leq c k\log n$, for a constant $c$. This establishes an NQS analog of the area law constraint for matrix product states and rules out volume law entanglement for NQS with $O(1)$ nonlinearities. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that the scaling with $n$ is tight for a wide variety of NQS. Our work establishes a fundamental constraint on NQS that applies broadly across different network designs, while reinforcing their substantial expressive power.

Title: Secret communication games and a hierarchy of quasiparticle statistics in 3 + 1D topological phases
Authors: Zhiyuan Wang
Abstract: We show that a family of secret communication challenge games naturally define a hierarchy of emergent quasiparticle statistics in three-dimensional (3D) topological phases. The winning strategies exploit a special class of the recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent $R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum matter.

Title: Dipole-quadrupole model and multipole analysis of resonant membrane metasurfaces
Authors: Izzatjon Allayarov, Andrey B. Evlyukhin, Antonio Calà Lesina
Abstract: Membrane-metasurfaces, formed by periodic arrangements of holes in a dielectric layer, are gaining attention for their easier manufacturing via subtractive techniques, unnecessity of substrates, and access to resonant near-fields. Despite their practical relevance, their theoretical description remains elusive. Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for the multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission spectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are generally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid nanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is necessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to showcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal position of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the sufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism can explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference, including lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and quasi-bound states in the continuum. We also present the applicability of the method to membrane-metasurfaces with non-centrosymmetric unit cells (e.g., conical holes and surface voids). By enabling a deeper insight into the coupling mechanisms leading to the formation of local and collective resonances, our method expands the electromagnetics toolbox to study, understand, and design conventional and membrane-metasurfaces.

Title: Open Quantum Dynamics Theory for Coulomb Potentials: Hierarchical Equations of Motion for Atomic Orbitals (AO-HEOM)
Authors: Yankai Zhang, oshitaka Tanimura
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of Coulomb potential systems in thermal baths. We study these systems within the framework of open quantum dynamics theory, focusing on preserving the rotational symmetry of the entire system, including the baths. Thus, we employ a three-dimensional rotationally invariant system-bath (3D-RISB) model to derive numerically ``exact'' hierarchical equations of motion for atomic orbitals (AO-HEOM) that enable a non-perturbative and non-Markovian treatment of system-bath interactions at finite temperatures. To assess the formalism, we calculated the linear absorption spectrum of an atomic system under isotropic thermal environment, with systematic variation of system-bath coupling strength and temperature.

Title: Quantification of Electrolyte Degradation in Lithium-ion Batteries with Neutron Imaging Techniques

Abstract: Non-destructive characterization of lithium-ion batteries provides critical insights for optimizing performance and lifespan while preserving structural integrity. Optimizing electrolyte design in commercial LIBs requires consideration of composition, electrolyte-to-capacity ratio, spatial distribution, and associated degradation pathways. However, existing non-destructive methods for studying electrolyte infiltration, distribution, and degradation in LIBs lack the spatiotemporal resolution required for precise observation and quantification of the electrolyte. In this study, we employ neutron imaging with sufficient spatial resolution ~150 um and large field of view 20x20 cm2 to quantitatively resolve the electrolyte inventory and distribution within LiFePO4/graphite pouch cells under high-temperature accelerated aging. Quantitative standard curves based on neutron transmission attenuation reveal a clear electrolyte dry-out threshold at 3.18 g Ah-1 and the two stages evolutions of EI during cell aging were quantified. By integrating non-destructive electrochemical diagnostics, accelerated graphite material loss and liquid phase Li+ diffusion degradation is observed during pore-drying. Further analysis, including operando cyclic aging, reveals that the neutron transmission below the saturation reference is due to the enrichment of hydrogen nuclei within the solid-electrolyte interphase. Assumed pore-drying does not occur, the SEI signal of the electrodes can be quantitatively decoupled during ageing. Combined analyses with NI, TOF-SIMS, and SEM reveal that high EI cells exhibit uniform SEI growth and reduced degradation, while low EI cells show uneven SEI formation, accelerating capacity loss. This study unveils a dynamic electrolyte infiltration-consumption-dry-out process in LIBs, offering non-destructive and quantitative insights to guide sustainable and durable battery development.

Title: ToPolyAgent: AI Agents for Coarse-Grained Topological Polymer Simulations
Authors: Lijie Ding, Jan-Michael Carrillo, Changwoo Do
Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.

Title: Continuous Uniqueness and Novelty Metrics for Generative Modeling of Inorganic Crystals
Authors: Masahiro Negishi, Hyunsoo Park, Kinga O. Mastej, Aron Walsh
Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change, increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function. However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions, providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models for inorganic crystals.

Title: Hydrodynamic Ratchet for Tracer Transport in a Soft Microchannel: A Detailed Analysis
Authors: Aakash Anand, A. Bhattacharyay
Abstract: Understanding surface-driven transport is of paramount importance from the perspective of biological applications and the synthesis of microfluidic devices. In this work, we develop an analysis of a local inversion symmetry broken fluid flow model through an undulating microchannel. Surface undulations of a few tens of Hertz in a soft microchannel keep the fluid flow in a low Reynolds number regime, allowing the advantage of a perturbation analysis of fluid flow. Using this, we develop a detailed analysis of the relationship between the fluid velocity and surface undulations, which is crucial for the subsequent numerical analysis of tracer motion. We used this information to study the dynamics of a tracer particle in the velocity field of an undulating microchannel. We show that the tracer particle can undergo ratcheting (which we call the hydrodynamics ratchet effect) in very specific, physically meaningful circumstances. We observe a ratcheting velocity of $\sim 0.15 \;\mu$m/sec for a micrometre-sized particle at room temperature in water when the undulations wavelength is of the order of 1 $\mu$m.

Title: Semiclassical analytical solutions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in a quantum billiard
Authors: Yaoqi Ye, Chengkai Lin, Xiao Wang
Abstract: We derive semiclassical analytical solutions for both the diagonal and off-diagonal functions in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in a quarter-stadium quantum billiard. For a representative observable, we obtain an explicit expression and an asymptotic closed-form solution that naturally separate into a local contribution and a phase-space correlation term. These analytical results predict the band structure of the observable matrix, including its bandwidth and scaling behavior. We further demonstrate that our analytical formula is equivalent to the prediction of Berry's conjecture. Supported by numerical evidence, we show that Berry's conjecture captures the energetic long-wavelength behavior in the space of eigenstates, while our analytical solution describes the asymptotic behavior of the f function in the semiclassical limit. Finally, by revealing the connection between the bandwidth scaling and the underlying classical dynamics, our results suggest that the ETH carries important physical implications in single-particle and few-body systems, where "thermalization" manifests as the loss of information about initial conditions.

Title: Spatiotemporal stability of synchronized coupled map lattice states
Authors: Domenico Lippolis
Abstract: In the realm of spatiotemporal chaos, unstable periodic orbits play a major role in understanding the dynamics. Their stability changes and bifurcations in general are thus of central interest. Here, coupled map lattice discretizations of nonlinear partial differential equations, exhibiting a variety of behaviors depending on the coupling strength, are considered. In particular, the linear stability analysis of synchronized states is performed by evaluating the Bravais lattice orbit Jacobian in its reciprocal space first Brillouin zone, with space and time treated on equal grounds. The eigenvalues of the orbit Jacobian operator, computed as functions of the coupling strength, tell us about the stability of the periodic orbit under a perturbation of a certain time- and space frequency. Moreover, the stability under aperiodic, that is, incoherent perturbations, is revealed by integrating the sum of the stability exponents over all space-time frequencies.

Title: Transport properties of stochastic fluids
Authors: Chandrodoy Chattopadhyay, Josh Ott, Thomas Schaefer, Vladimir V. Skokov
Abstract: We study heat conduction and momentum transport in the context of stochastic fluid dynamics. We consider a fluid described by model H in the classification of Hohenberg and Halperin. We study both non-critical and critical fluids, and we investigate transport properties in two as well as three dimensions. Our results are based on numerical simulations of model H using a Metropolis algorithm, and we employ Kubo relations to extract transport coefficients. We observe the expected logarithmic divergence of the shear viscosity in a two-dimensional non-critical fluid. At a critical point, we find that the transport coefficients exhibit power-law scaling with the system size $L$. The strongest divergence is seen for the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ in two dimensions. We find $\kappa\sim L^{x_\kappa}$ with $x_\kappa=1.6\pm 0.1$. The divergence is weaker in three dimensions, $x_\kappa=1.25 \pm 0.3$, and the scaling exponent for the shear viscosity, $x_\eta$, is significantly smaller than $x_\kappa$ in both two and three dimensions.

Title: Modeling Epidemics on Multiplex Networks: Epidemic Threshold and Basic Reproduction Number
Authors: Eric Alejandro Rozan, Mario Ignacio Simoy, Sebastian Bouzat, Marcelo Nestor Kuperman
Abstract: Accurate epidemic forecasting requires models that account for the layered and heterogeneous nature of real social interactions. The basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$ calculated from models that assume homogeneous mixing or single-layer contact structures have limited applicability to complex social systems. Here, we propose an expression of $\mathcal R_0$ in the context of multiplex networks, enabling the analysis of disease transmission across multiple social layers. We adapt the Degree-Based Mean-Field (DBMF) SIR model for single-layered complex networks to the multiplex setting, where each layer has its own degree distribution and infection rate. Using the Next Generation Matrix method, we derive an analytical expression for the basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$. Numerical integration of the multiplex DBMF equations shows that $\mathcal R_0 = 1$ marks the epidemic threshold and governs the functional dependence of key outbreak indicators. In addition to the exact result for the $\mathcal R_0$, we provide an approximation denoted as $\tau$, which is easier to compute and more straightforward to interpret in terms of the parameters of the system, and shares most of the expected properties of the basic reproduction number. Stochastic agent-based simulations confirm these results, demonstrating a direct correspondence between $\tau$ and the average number of secondary infections in the early epidemic phase, in line with the interpretation of $\mathcal R_0$. This research provides a robust generalization of $\mathcal R_0$ for layered contact structures, offering a more realistic basis for epidemic forecasting and the design of intervention strategies.

Title: Time-dependent Variational Principles for Hybrid Non-Unitary Dynamics: Application to Driven-Dissipative Superconductors
Authors: Pasquale Filice, Marco Schirò, Giacomo Mazza
Abstract: We introduce time-dependent variational principles to study the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum many-body systems, including dynamics described by the full Lindblad master equation, the non-Hermitian dynamics corresponding to the no-click limit of the fully post-selected quantum trajectories, and the dynamics described by a hybrid Lindbladian with a control parameter $\alpha$ which interpolates between the full post-selection and averaging over all quantum trajectories. As an application we study the non-unitary dynamics of a lossy or driven-dissipative BCS superconductors, evolving in presence of two-body losses and two-body pumps. We show that the non-Hermitian limit acts as a singular limit of the hybrid dissipative dynamics, leading to a sharp modification of the universal approach to the driven-dissipative steady-states. By considering the dissipative dynamics with pair losses, we show that, as the non-Hermitian limit is approached, the density dynamics sharply evolves from a universal power-law to exponential decay that converges towards a quasi-steady plateau characterized by the freezing of the particle depletion due to pair losses. The reached quasi-stationary density increases as a function of the dissipation rate highlighting the emergence of a non-Hermitian Zeno effect in the lossy dynamics. For the driven-dissipative case, we show that, in the non-Hermitian limit, the system gets trapped into an effective negative temperature state, thus skipping the infinite temperature steady-state reached in the presence of finite contribution of the quantum jumps. We rationalize these findings in terms of the conservation of the length of the pseudospins which, in the non-Hermitian limit, suppresses the effective single-particle losses and pumps acting on the non-condensed particles.

Title: Thermodynamics of quantum processes: An operational framework for free energy and reversible athermality
Authors: Himanshu Badhani, Dhanuja G S, Siddhartha Das
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamics of quantum processes (quantum channels) by axiomatically introducing the free energy for channels, defined via the quantum relative entropy with an absolutely thermal channel whose fixed output is in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. This definition finds strong support through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity distillation and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work connects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and maximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing capabilities.

Title: Prethermal gauge structure and surface growth in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories
Authors: Lukas Homeier, Andrea Pizzi, Hongzheng Zhao, Jad C. Halimeh, Fabian Grusdt, Ana Maria Rey
Abstract: Universal aspects of thermalization in interacting many-body systems are typically challenging to derive microscopically, yet provide a powerful framework for understanding emergent phenomena. Here, we numerically study the mean-field dynamics of a $(2+1)$D spin system with thousands of spins and show that experimentally-feasible two-body Ising interactions can stabilize a prethermal $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge structure with dynamical matter, manifested by a gauge-invariant plateau with exponentially long lifetime. Eventually, the metastable prethermal $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge structure breaks down via a proliferation of Gauss' law defects, similar to bubble formation in false vacuum decay. In this regime, we discover spatio-temporal correlations described by a non-linear surface growth consistent with the $(1+1)$D Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We benchmark our results in small systems against semi-classical discrete time Wigner approximation (DTWA) and exact diagonalization (ED), where the breakdown of DTWA signals the emergence of an extensive number of local symmetries that strongly influence the thermalization pathway. Our model provides a testbed for quantum simulators and is directly implementable in large-scale arrays of Rydberg atoms.

Title: Entanglement detection in quantum materials with competing orders
Authors: Giacomo Mazza, Costantino Budroni
Abstract: We investigate entanglement detection in quantum materials through criteria based on the simultaneous suppression of collective matter excitations. Unlike other detection schemes, these criteria can be applied to continuous and unbounded variables. By considering a system of interacting dipoles on a lattice, we show the detection of collective entanglement arising from two different physical mechanisms, namely, the ferroelectric ordering and the dressing of matter degrees of freedom by light. In the latter case, the detection shows the formation of a collective entangled phase not directly related to spontaneous symmetry breaking. These results open a new perspective for the entanglement characterization of competing orders in quantum materials, and have direct application to quantum paraelectrics with large polariton splittings.

Title: Nonequilibrium Relaxation and Odd-Even Effect in Finite-Temperature Electron Gases
Authors: Eric Nilsson, Ulf Gran, Johannes Hofmann
Abstract: Pauli blocking in Fermi liquids imposes strong phase-space constraints on quasiparticle lifetimes, leading to a well-known quadratic-in-temperature decay rate of quasiparticle modes at low temperatures. In two-dimensional systems, however, even longer-lived modes are predicted (dubbed ``odd-parity'' modes) that involve a collective deformation of the Fermi distribution. Here, we present an efficient method to evaluate the full spectrum of relaxational eigenmodes of a Fermi liquid within kinetic theory. We employ this method to study the experimentally relevant case of a Fermi liquid with screened Coulomb interactions and map out the decay rates of quasiparticle modes beyond the asymptotic low-temperature limit up to the Fermi temperature, thus covering the entire temperature range of typical experiments. We confirm the existence of anomalously long-lived odd-parity modes and provide a comprehensive classification and detailed analysis of the relaxation spectrum. In particular, we find that (i) the odd-parity effect in the decay rates extends to temperatures as large as $T=0.15T_F$, (ii) there is only a small number of long-lived odd-parity modes, with an infinite number of remaining modes that show standard Fermi-liquid scaling, and (iii) the ratio between the odd- and even-parity lifetimes is tunable with the Coulomb interaction strength, in addition to temperature, which reflects a difference in the microscopic relaxation mechanism of the modes. Our findings provide a comprehensive description of the nonequilibrium relaxation behavior of two-dimensional electron gases and bridge a significant gap in our understanding of these systems.

Title: Lattice Instabilities Along the Transformation from Hexagonal to Cuboidal Structures in Hard- and Soft-Sphere Models
Authors: Andres Robles-Navarro, Shaun Cooper, Andreas W. Hauser, Fabian Zehetmair, Odile Smits, Peter Schwerdtfeger
Abstract: The diffusionless Burgers-Bain phase transition from a hcp arrangement to a cuboidal lattice (fcc and bcc) is analysed in great detail for Lennard-Jones solids. From the lattice vectors of an underlying bi-lattice smoothly connecting these phases, we are able to express the corresponding lattice sums for inverse power potentials in terms of fast converging Bessel function expansions resulting in an efficient evaluation to computer accuracy for cohesive energies. From the kissing hard-sphere limit we derive exact analytical expressions for the lattice parameters varying along the minimum energy path of the phase transition. This simple model suggests that for the Burgers-Bain transformation of a LJ solid requires a minimum of four lattice parameters, $(a,\alpha,\beta,\gamma=c/a)$, describing the change in the base lattice lengths $a$ and $c$, the shear force acting on the hexagonal base plane ($\alpha$), the sliding force of the middle layer of the original hexagonal packing arrangement($\beta$), and the cuboidal transformation ($\gamma=c/a$). This choice results in a two-step process: hcp$\to$fcc$\to$bcc. However, a further extension of the parameter space including an additional slide parameter for the middle layer, one suddenly observes a distinct symmetry-breaking effect along the hcp$\rightarrow$fcc transition path with a bifurcation point appearing joining the original Burgers with the Bain path of the bcc$\rightarrow$fcc cuboidal transition. Furthermore, for soft LJ potentials the bcc phase appears as a local minimum along the Burgers hcp$\rightarrow$fcc path with two transition states to either the hcp or fcc phase. The underlying topology of the Burgers-Bain phase transition also incorporates the rhombohedral distortion of the bcc phase, which is analyzed in detail.

Title: A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics
Authors: Karl J Friston, Maxwell J D Ramstead, Dalton A R Sakthivadivel
Abstract: We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. The FEP is a method whose use allows us to build a model of the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations amongst subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations amongst subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.

Title: Topological Phases of Many-Body Localized Systems: Beyond Eigenstate Order
Authors: David M. Long, Dominic V. Else
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) lends remarkable robustness to nonequilibrium phases of matter. Such phases can show topological and symmetry breaking order in their ground and excited states, but they may also belong to an anomalous localized topological phase (ALT phase). All eigenstates in an ALT phase are trivial, in that they can be deformed to product states, but the entire Hamiltonian cannot be deformed to a trivial localized model without going through a delocalization transition. Using a correspondence between MBL phases with short-ranged entanglement and locality preserving unitaries - called quantum cellular automata (QCA) - we reduce the classification of ALT phases to that of QCA. This method extends to periodically (Floquet) and quasiperiodically driven ALT phases, and captures anomalous Floquet phases within the same framework as static phases. We considerably develop the study of the topology of QCA, allowing us to classify static and driven ALT phases in low dimensions. The QCA framework further generalizes to include symmetry-enriched ALT phases (SALT phases) - which we also classify in low dimensions - and provides a large class of soluble models suitable for realization in quantum simulators. In systematizing the study of ALT phases, we both greatly extend the classification of interacting nonequilibrium systems and clarify a confusion in the literature which implicitly equates nontrivial Hamiltonians with nontrivial ground states.

Title: Curvature dependent dynamics of a bacterium confined in a giant unilamellar vesicle
Authors: Olivia Vincent, Aparna Sreekumari, Manoj Gopalakrishnan, Vishwas V Vasisht, Bibhu Ranjan Sarangi
Abstract: We investigate the positional behavior of a single bacterium confined within a vesicle by measuring the probability of locating the bacterium at a certain distance from the vesicle boundary. We observe that the distribution is bi-exponential in nature. Near the boundary, the distribution exhibits rapid exponential decay, transitioning to a slower exponential decay, and eventually becoming uniform further away from the boundary. The length scales associated with the decay are found to depend on the confinement radius. We interpret these observations using molecular simulations and analytical calculations based on the Fokker-Planck equation for an Active Brownian Particle model. Our findings reveal that the small length scale is strongly influenced by the translational diffusion coefficient, while the larger length scale is governed by rotational diffusivity and self-propulsion. These results are explained in terms of two dimensionless parameters that explicitly include the confinement radius. The scaling behavior predicted analytically for the observed length scales is confirmed through simulations.

Title: Spin excitations of the Shastry-Sutherland model -- altermagnetism and deconfined quantum criticality
Authors: Hongyu Chen, Guijing Duan, Changle Liu, Yi Cui, Weiqiang Yu, Z. Y. Xie, Rong Yu
Abstract: Frustrated quantum magnets can host a variety of exotic spin excitations, including fractionalized spin excitations coupled to emergent gauge fields at deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) and chiral magnons in altermagnets. Here, we investigate the spin excitation spectra of the highly frustrated $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic (AFM) Shastry-Sutherland model, focusing on the evolution of low-energy collective modes from the Néel AFM phase to the plaquette valence bond solid (PVBS). We demonstrate that the AFM state exhibits altermagnetic behavior, characterized by a non-relativistic splitting between two chiral magnon bands. Furthermore, we identify two additional low-energy excitations: a Higgs mode in the longitudinal excitation channel and an $S=0$ excitation with vanishing spectral weight. As the system approaches the AFM-to-PVBS transition, both these modes soften along with the lowest-energy triplet and singlet modes in the PVBS state. The closing gap of the Higgs mode, combined with the nearly degenerate velocities of $S=1$ and $S=0$ excitations, provides spectral evidence that the AFM-to-PVBS transition is proximate to a DQCP with emergent $O(4)$ symmetry. Our results help clarify the spectral signature of a broad class of symmetry enhanced quantum phase transitions including deconfined quantum criticality.

Title: The elusive fluid-and-crystal coexistence state in simulations of monodisperse, hard-sphere colloids
Authors: J. Galen Wang, Umesh Dhumal, Monica E. A. Zakhari, Roseanna N. Zia
Abstract: We examine why simulations replicating monodisperse purely-repulsive hard sphere (MPRHS) theory fail to produce explicit, spontaneous, equilibrium coexistence of fluid and crystal domains. MPRHS fluid-to-solid phase transitions are well established, as is prediction of the coexistence region via thermodynamic theory. Consensus holds that the MPRHS coexistence region is metastable, where nucleation governs crystallization. Our review explores the abundant physics and rheology literature for MPRHS, revealing two related observations: We find clear mechanistic explanation for crystallization of MPRHS, and that producing spontaneous MPRHS coexistence in simulations is notoriously difficult. Frenkel's mechanism-that vibrational entropy gains offset configurational entropy losses to drive MPRHS phase transition-suggests system size is the fundamental simulation issue. Alder and Wainwright recognized this constraint and emphasized the merit of direct observation in simulations, of explicitly following an isotherm through the coexistence region. But with 1M particles, estimated nucleation time is 317M years. Recent large-scale simulations reinforce this, showing phase transition, but not reporting explicit phase separation. The ideal condition is a tractably-large system and minimal perturbation to exit metastability. Instead, brute force is often used to trigger nucleation and phase separation via seeding, pre-construction, or gravity. Some simulations do show brief spontaneous coexistence but a metastable crystal or fluid subsequently overtakes the system. Putatively-hard WCA potentials allow extra free volume, lowering osmotic pressure and the energy barrier, and avoiding the strict short/long-range entropy challenge. Overall, rheological and computational demonstration of Frenkel's mechanism for MPRHS remains elusive, awaiting sufficiently large systems of sufficiently hard MPRHS.

Title: Optimal Estimation of Temperature
Authors: Shaoyong Zhang, Zhaoyu Fei, Xiaoguang Wang
Abstract: Temperature of a finite-sized system fluctuates due to the thermal fluctuations. However, a systematic mathematical framework for measuring or estimating the temperature is still underdeveloped. Here, we incorporate the estimation theory in statistical inference to estimate the temperature of a finite-sized system and propose optimal estimation based on the uniform minimum variance unbiased estimation. Treating the finite-sized system as a thermometer measuring the temperature of a heat reservoir, we demonstrate that different optimal estimation of parameters yield different formulas of entropy, e.g., optimal estimation of inverse temperature (or temperature) aligns with the Boltzmann entropy (or Gibbs entropy). The optimal estimation leads to a achievable energy-temperature uncertainty relation and exhibits sample-size dependence, coinciding with their counterparts in nanothermodynamics. The achievable bound and the non-Gaussian distribution of temperature enable experimental testing in finite-sized systems.

Title: Multifractal-enriched mobility edges and emergent quantum phases in Rydberg atomic arrays
Authors: Shan-Zhong Li, Yi-Cai Zhang, Yucheng Wang, Shanchao Zhang, Shi-Liang Zhu, Zhi Li
Abstract: Anderson localization describes disorder-induced phase transitions, distinguishing between localized and extended states. In quasiperiodic systems, a third multifractal state emerges, characterized by unique energy and wave functions. However, the corresponding multifractal-enriched mobility edges and three-state-coexisting quantum phases have yet to be experimentally detected. In this work, we propose exactly-solvable one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models that simultaneously host three-state-coexisting quantum phases, with their phase boundaries analytically derived via Avila's global theorem. Furthermore, we propose experimental protocols via Rydberg atom arrays to realize these states. Notably, we demonstrate a spectroscopic technique capable of measuring inverse participation ratios across real-space and dual-space domains, enabling simultaneous characterization of localized, extended, and multifractal quantum phases in systems with up to tens of qubits. Our work opens new avenues for the experimental exploration of Anderson localization and multifractal states in artificial quantum systems.

Title: Global symmetries of quantum lattice models under non-invertible dualities
Authors: Weiguang Cao, Yuan Miao, Masahito Yamazaki
Abstract: Non-invertible dualities/symmetries have become an important tool in the study of quantum field theories and quantum lattice models in recent years. One of the most studied examples is non-invertible dualities obtained by gauging a discrete group. When the physical system has more global symmetries than the gauged symmetry, it has not been thoroughly investigated how those global symmetries transform under non-invertible duality. In this paper, we study the change of global symmetries under non-invertible duality of gauging a discrete group $G$ in the context of (1+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. We obtain the global symmetries of the dual model by focusing on different Hilbert space sectors determined by the $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We provide general conjectures of global symmetries of the dual model forming an algebraic ring of the double cosets. We present concrete examples of the XXZ models and the duals, providing strong evidence for the conjectures.

Title: Influence of Fermi Surface Geometry and Van Hove Singularities on the Optical Response of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$
Authors: Meghdad Yazdani-Hamid, Mehdi Biderang, Alireza Akbari
Abstract: Motivated by the sensitivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ to Fermi surface reconstructions under strain, we investigate how Fermi surface geometry and Van Hove singularities influence the optical Hall response and polar Kerr effect. Within a three-orbital model, we explore the impact of chemical potential and interlayer hopping on superconducting pairing and response functions. We find that $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}+ig$ symmetries are the leading candidates for the quasi-2D orbital, while a chiral $p$-wave state in the quasi-1D orbitals is essential for generating an accessible Kerr angle. The Lifshitz transition is shown to affect coherence factors and density-of-states peaks, producing sharp signatures in $T_c$ and optical transport. Inter-orbital charge transfer further enhances these effects by modifying the balance between quasi-1D and quasi-2D contributions. These results provide a framework for interpreting Kerr effect experiments in multi-orbital superconductors.

Title: Anderson transition symmetries at the band-edge of a correlated Sn/Si monolayer
Authors: Mathieu Lizée, Mohammadmehdi Torkzadeh, François Debontridder, Marie Hervé, Christophe Brun, Igor Burmistrov, Tristan Cren
Abstract: Anderson localization is predicted to enhance the critical temperature of disordered superconductors. Despite a huge body of theoretical work based on non-linear sigma models, experiments are lacking to understand correlated electrons in disordered potentials. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its likely antiferromagnetic Mott-correlated groundstate. We analyze the statistical properties of tunneling conductance maps of increasingly localized states as we approach the edge of the valence band. Using multifractal analysis, we show that the system follows an exact symmetry relation based on the algebraic structure of nonlinear sigma-models (NLsMs). We anticipate that this symmetry may be broken in specific - e.g. chiral electronic phases. Finally, we point out that multifractal analysis can equally be applied to universal conductance fluctuations in magneto-transport experiments, thus providing a powerful tool to probe the underlying symmetries of disordered electronic phases.

Title: Spectroscopic probe of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range
Authors: Johanna Richter, Somnath Jana, Robert Behrends, Carl S. Davies, Dieter W. Engel, Martin Hennecke, Daniel Schick, Clemens von Korff Schmising, Stefan Eisebitt
Abstract: The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This approach to probing ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.

Title: Tuning Charge Order in $κ$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$X (X=Br, Cl) via Uniaxial Strain
Authors: Jesse Liebman, Svetlana Torunova, John A. Schlueter, Elena Zhilyaeva, Natalia Drichko
Abstract: In condensed matter physics, experimental control of the properties of materials realizes the aspiration to physically govern the properties of materials and demonstrates an understanding of their underlying physics. In recent years, meaningful progress has been made towards a description of the physics of correlated electron systems, but examples of control of these systems remain rare. In this work, we confirm a phase diagram theoretically proposed for organic Mott insulators. We use $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$X (X=Br,Cl) (BEDT-TTF = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafuvalene) materials as experimental realization of the proposed model and demonstrate the ability to tune them both ways across a phase border between a Mott insulator with a uniformly distributed charge and a charge ordered state through the application of uniaxial strain. We induce charge order at 33 K in the quantum dipole liquid material $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Br through the application of tensile strain of 0.4% along the c-axis. We suppress charge order down to 10 K in $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Cl by applying a tensile strain of 1.6% along the b-axis. We use Raman scattering spectroscopy to probe both the charge state and a soft mode of collective dipole fluctuations close to the phase border.

Title: Effects of Strain-Induced Pseudogauge Fields on Exciton Dispersion, Transport, and Interactions in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Nanoribbons
Authors: Shiva Heidari, Shervin Parsi, Pouyan Ghaemi
Abstract: We study the effects of strain on exciton dynamics in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanoribbons. Using the Bethe-Salpeter formalism, we derive the exciton dispersion relation in strained TMDs and demonstrate that strain-induced pseudo-gauge fields significantly influence exciton transport and interactions. Our results show that low-energy excitons occur at finite center-of-mass momentum, leading to modified diffusion properties. Furthermore, the exciton dipole moment depends on center-of-mass momentum, which enhances exciton-exciton interactions. These findings highlight the potential of strain engineering as a powerful tool for controlling exciton transport and interactions in nanoribbon-based TMD optoelectronic and quantum devices.

Title: Breaking a superfluid harmonic dam: Observation and theory of Riemann invariants and accelerating sonic horizons
Authors: Shashwat Sharan, Judith Gonzalez Sorribes, Patrick Sprenger, Mark A. Hoefer, P. Engels, Boaz Ilan, M. E. Mossman
Abstract: An experimental and theoretical study of sonic horizons emerging from the dam-break problem in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined in an anisotropic harmonic trap is presented. Measurements, analysis, and numerics reveal the formation of a sonic horizon that undergoes acceleration due to harmonic confinement. The superfluid is characterized using a robust measurement technique to determine Riemann invariants. Experimental observations agree with an analytical solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and computations. The collision and annihilation between two sonic horizons at long times is predicted.

Title: Record negative photoconductivity in N-polar AlGaN/GaN quantum-well heterostructures
Authors: Maciej Matys, Atsushi Yamada, Toshihiro Ohki, Kouji Tsunoda
Abstract: The AlGaN/GaN quantum-well heterostructures typically exhibit a positive photoconductivity (PPC) during the light illumination. Surprisingly, we found that introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier into N-polar AlGaN/GaN quantum-well heterostructures induces a transition in these heterostructures from PPC to negativie photoconductivity (NPC) as the SL period number increased at room temperature. This transition occurred under an infrared light illumination and can be well explained in terms of the excitation of hot electrons from the two-dimensional electron gas and subsequent trapping them in a SL structure. The NPC effect observed in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with SL back barrier exhibits photoconductivity yield exceeding 85 % and thus is the largest ones reported so far for semiconductors. In addition, NPC signal remains relatively stable at high temperatures up to 400 K. The obtained results can be interesting for the development of NPC related devices such as photoelectric logic gates, photoelectronic memory and infrared photodetectors.

Title: Hydrostatic equilibrium in multi-Weyl semimetals
Authors: Jewel Kumar Ghosh, Francisco Peña-Benítez, Patricio Salgado-Rebolledo
Abstract: We study the hydrostatic equilibrium of multi-Weyl semimetals, a class of systems with Weyl-like quasi-particles but anisotropic dispersion relation $\omega^2 \sim k_\parallel^2 + k_\perp^{2n}$, with $n$ a possitive integer. A characteristic feature of multi-Weyl systems is the lack of Lorentz invariance, instead, they possess the reduced spacetime symmetry $(SO(1,1)\times SO(2))\ltimes \mathbb R^4$. In this work we propose a covariant formulation for the low energy theory, allowing for a minimal coupling of the fermion field to external geometric background and $U(1)$ gauge field. The non-Lorentzian structure of the field theory demands introducing an Aristotelian spacetime analogous to the so-called stringy Newton-Cartan geometry \cite{Andringa:2012uz}. Our proposal allows for a systematic study of the hydrostatic properties via the derivation of the partition function of the system. In addition to multi-Weyl models, our formulation can be applied to systems with similar spacetime symmetry groups, such as Bjorken flow.

Title: Probing fractional quantum Hall effect by photoluminescence
Authors: Aamir A. Makki, Mytraya Gattu, J. K. Jain
Abstract: The recent discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states - fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states realized without an external magnetic field - in twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers represents a significant development in condensed matter physics. Notably, these states were first observed via photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Surprisingly, a general theoretical understanding of PL is not available even for the standard FQH states. For an ideal two-dimensional system, the energy of the emitted photon is predicted to be independent of the correlations, but we show that the PL intensity contains valuable information. Specifically, we predict that at finite temperatures, the PL intensity peaks at the Jain fillings \nu = n/(2n \pm 1), and away from these fillings, the binding energies of the composite-fermion excitons and trions can be deduced from the temperature dependence of the intensity. We discuss implications for PL experiments in semiconductor quantum wells and twisted TMD bilayers.

Authors: Jacky Even, Simon Thebaud, Aseem Rajan Kshirsagar, Zeli Xu, Laurent Pedesseau, Marios Zacharias, Claudine Katan
Abstract: Short abstract: The paper reviews the physics of Fröhlich excitonic polarons from the viewpoint of empirical approaches with some original developments. Models for excitonic polarons in ionic semiconductors in the spirit of the Lee Low and Pines (LLP) model for free polarons were initiated by Toyozawa and Hermanson and extended by Pollman and Buttner (PB). The dominant electron-hole interaction with the lattice introduced by Frohlich is represented by a long-range effective interaction with a single longitudinal optical polar mode. The properties of the excitonic polarons are characterized by various physical quantities such as effective dielectric constants, effective masses, virtual phonon populations, carrier self-energies and binding energies, and effective electron-hole interactions mediated by the lattice. In 3D perovskites, the excitonic polarons deviate from the simplified picture of weakly interacting (almost free) polarons, with sizeable effects of electron-hole correlations on all the physical properties.

Title: Dimensional crossover of class D real-space topological invariants
Authors: Martin Rodriguez-Vega, Terry A. Loring, Alexander Cerjan
Abstract: The topological properties of a material depend on its symmetries, parameters, and spatial dimension. Changes in these properties due to parameter and symmetry variations can be understood by computing the corresponding topological invariant. Since topological invariants are typically defined for a fixed spatial dimension, there is no existing framework to understand the effects of changing spatial dimensions via invariants. Here, we introduce a framework to study topological phase transitions as a system's dimensionality is altered using real-space topological markers. Specifically, we consider Shiba lattices, which are class D materials formed by magnetic atoms on the surface of a conventional superconductor, and characterize the evolution of their topology when an initial circular island is deformed into a chain. We also provide a measure of the corresponding protection against disorder. Our framework is generalizable to any symmetry class and spatial dimension, potentially guiding the design of materials by identifying, for example, the minimum thickness of a slab required to maintain three-dimensional topological properties.

Title: Simulating non-Brownian suspensions with non-homogeneous Navier slip boundary conditions
Authors: Daniela Moreno-Chaparro, Florencio Balboa Usabiaga, Nicolas Moreno, Marco Ellero
Abstract: Fluid-structure interactions are commonly modeled using no-slip boundary conditions. However, small deviations from these conditions can significantly alter the dynamics of suspensions and particles, especially at the micro and nano scales. This work presents a robust implicit solvent method for simulating non-colloidal suspensions with non-homogeneous Navier slip boundary conditions. Our approach is based on a regularized boundary integral formulation, enabling accurate and efficient computation of hydrodynamic interactions. This makes the method well-suited for large-scale simulations. We validate the method by comparing computed drag forces on homogeneous and Janus particles with analytical results. Additionally, we consider the effective viscosity of suspensions with varying slip lengths, benchmarking against available analytical no-slip and partial-slip theories.

Title: Construction of Kondo Chains by Engineering Porphyrin π-Radicals on Au(111)
Authors: Yan Zhao, Kaiyue Jiang, Peng-Yi Liu, Jie Li, Ruoning Li, Xin Li, Xinchen Fang, Anjing Zhao, Yutong Zhu, Hongxiang Xu, Ting Chen, Dong Wang, Xiaodong Zhuang, Shimin Hou, Kai Wu, Song Gao, Qing-Feng Sun, Yajie Zhang, Yongfeng Wang
Abstract: Quantum manipulation of molecular radical spins provides a crucial platform for exploring emergent phenomena in many-body systems. Here, we combine surface-confined synthesis with scanning tunneling microscopy(STM)tip-induced dehydrogenation to achieve atom-precise engineering of quasi-one-dimensional porphyrin-based Kondo chains (1-7 units) on Au(111). High-resolution STS measurements and low-energy effective modeling collectively demonstrate that {\pi}-radicals at each fused-porphyrin unit form Kondo singlets screened by conduction electrons. Adjacent singlets develop direct coherent coupling via quantum-state-overlap-enabled electron tunneling. Crucially, chiral symmetry in the effective model governs zero-mode distribution-present in odd-length chains yet absent in even-length chains-which dictates pronounced odd-even quantum effects in STS spectra of finite chains. Furthermore, the number of parallel porphyrin chains non-monotonically tunes the competition between the Kondo effect and spin exchange, showing opposing trends in strength and demonstrating that both wave-function overlap and the SOMO-LUMO gap collectively govern these interactions. This work simultaneously resolves the dimensional dependence of many-body correlations in confined quantum systems and pioneers approaches for quantum-critical manipulation in molecular spin architectures.

Title: Beyond-quasiparticle transport with vertex correction: self-consistent ladder formalism for electron-phonon interactions
Authors: Jae-Mo Lihm, Samuel Poncé
Abstract: We present a self-consistent many-body framework for computing phonon-limited electronic transport from first principles, incorporating both beyond-quasiparticle effects and vertex corrections. Using the recently developed first-principles scGD0 method, we calculate spectral functions with nonperturbative effects such as broadening, satellites, and energy-dependent renormalization. We show that the scGD0 spectral functions outperform one-shot G0D0 and cumulant approximations in model Hamiltonians and real materials, eliminating unphysical spectral kinks and correctly predicting the phonon emission continuum. Building on this, we introduce the self-consistent ladder formalism for transport, which captures vertex corrections due to electron-phonon interactions. This approach unifies and improves upon the two state-of-the-art approaches for first-principles phonon-limited transport: the bubble approximation and the Boltzmann transport equation. Moreover, as a charge-conserving approximation, it enables consistent calculations of the optical conductivity and dielectric function. We validate the developed method against numerically exact results for model Hamiltonians in the dilute polaronic limit and apply it to real materials. Our results show quantitative agreement with the experimental dc conductivities in intrinsic semiconductors Si and ZnO and the SrVO3 metal, as well as excellent agreement with the experimental THz optical and dielectric properties of Si and ZnO. This work unifies first-principles and many-body approaches for studying transport, opening new directions for applying many-body theory to materials with strong electron-phonon interactions.

Title: Instability of the Haldane Phase: Roles of Charge Fluctuations and Hund's Coupling
Authors: Satoshi Nishimoto
Abstract: We systematically investigate the stability of the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase in spin-1/2 Heisenberg and half-filled Hubbard ladders coupled by ferromagnetic Hund's interactions. Using density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we analyze key signatures of the Haldane phase: long-range string order, finite spin gap, and characteristic entanglement spectrum degeneracies. In spin-only Heisenberg ladders, we find immediate onset and continuous strengthening of the Haldane phase with increasing Hund's coupling. In contrast, the inclusion of charge fluctuations in Hubbard ladders leads to a nontrivial stability regime, revealing a robust yet bounded region where SPT order persists despite significant charge fluctuations. We identify distinct boundaries separating a trivial insulating phase from the Haldane SPT phase, governed by both Coulomb repulsion and Hund's coupling. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom in correlated itinerant systems and establish essential criteria for observing Haldane physics experimentally in fermionic ladder materials.

Title: Unveiling Novel Resonant Interband Contribution to Polarizability in three-dimensional systems
Authors: Vivek Pandey, Snehasish Nandy, Pankaj Bhalla
Abstract: Polarizability plays an essential role in characterizing key phenomena, such as the screening effects, collective excitations, and dielectric functions present in the system. In three-dimensional materials, it typically comprises an intraband contribution, dependent on the chemical potential, and an interband contribution, largely independent of it. In this study, within the random phase approximation framework, we uncover a novel interband contribution that, unlike the conventional case, exhibits an explicit dependence on the chemical potential, which has no counterpart in two dimensions. In the long-wavelength limit, this term introduces a resonance feature with cubic wave-vector dependence when the chemical potential approaches the band edge, in contrast to the quadratic behavior characteristic of standard intraband and interband processes. Focusing on three-dimensional Dirac nodal line semimetals, we show that the polarizability is intraband-dominated at low frequencies, while interband processes prevail at intermediate and high frequencies, with the overall response being tunable via the chemical potential. Material-specific estimates for Ca$_3$P$_2$ and ZrSiS reveal a strong tunability of both contributions. These findings open new directions for probing frequency-dependent dielectric properties and hold promise for applications in tunable plasmonic and optoelectronic devices.

Title: Enhancement of superconductivity outside an Abrikosov vortex core in a tightly bound Cooper pair superconductor
Authors: Eugene B. Kolomeisky, Mia Kyler, Ishaan U. Patel
Abstract: Abrikosov vortices play a central role in the disruption of superconductivity in type-II superconductors. It is commonly accepted that as one moves away from the vortex's axis of an $s$-wave superconductor, the density of superconductive electrons gradually increases from zero to its bulk value. However, we demonstrate that this behavior is qualitatively altered in the zero-temperature limit provided that the Cooper pairs comprising the superconductive liquid are sufficiently tightly bound. Specifically, outside the vortex core, the density of superconductive electrons reaches a maximum surpassing its bulk value. This phenomenon has electrostatic origins: since normal electrons are absent and there exists a charged ionic background, the spatial variation of the charge density of superconductive electrons violates local neutrality, leading to the generation of an electric field. This electric field shrinks the vortex core and turns the density profile into that with a maximum, ensuring global neutrality. The effect is most pronounced in the limit of strong electrostatic screening, where the field configurations describing the vortex attain a universal form, with the electric field screened over a length scale determined by the London penetration depth.

Title: Non-equilibrium evaporation of Lennard-Jones fluids: Enskog-Vlasov theory and Hertz-Knudsen model
Authors: Shaokang Li, Livio Gibelli, Yonghao Zhang
Abstract: Enskog-Vlasov equation is currently the most sophisticated kinetic model for describing non-equilibrium evaporative flows. While it enables more efficient simulations than the molecular dynamics (MD) methods, its accuracy in reproducing the flow properties of real fluids is limited by both the assumptions underlying the Vlasov forcing term and the approximation introduced by the Enskog collision term for short-range molecular interactions. To address this limitation, this work proposes a molecular kinetic model specifically designed for real fluids, with the Lennard-Jones fluids as an example. The model is first applied to evaluate the equilibrium characteristics of a liquid-vapour system, including the liquid-vapour coexistence curve, transport coefficients, vapour pressure, and surface tension coefficient. The results show excellent agreement with the MD simulation and experimental data. Furthermore, the model is used to investigate non-equilibrium evaporation, with a particular focus on the velocity distribution function adjacent to the liquid-vapour interface. The results confirm that deviations from the Maxwellian distribution persist in the vapour region, indicating limitations of the classical Hertz-Knudsen relation under pronounced non-equilibrium conditions. This work represents a critical step towards the development of an accurate and efficient computational framework for modelling non-equilibrium liquid-vapour flows for real fluids, with direct relevance to practical applications such as flow cooling.

Title: Growth optimization of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate high-temperature superconducting thin films
Authors: Wei Lv, Zihao Nie, Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Guangdi Zhou, Qikun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
Abstract: The discovery of ambient-pressure nickelate high-temperature superconductivity provides a new platform for probing the underlying superconducting mechanisms. However, the thermodynamic metastability of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = lanthanide) presents significant challenges in achieving precise control over their structure and oxygen stoichiometry. This study establishes a systematic approach for growing phase-pure, high-quality Ln3Ni2O7 thin films on LaAlO3 and SrLaAlO4 substrates using gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy. The films grown under an ultrastrong oxidizing ozone atmosphere are superconducting without further post annealing. Specifically, the optimal Ln3Ni2O7/SrLaAlO4 superconducting film exhibits an onset transition temperature (Tc,onset) of 50 K. Four critical factors governing the crystalline quality and superconducting properties of Ln3Ni2O7 films are identified: 1) precise cation stoichiometric control suppresses secondary phase formation; 2) complete atomic layer-by-layer coverage coupled with 3) optimized interface reconstruction minimizes stacking faults; 4) accurate oxygen content regulation is essential for achieving a single superconducting transition and high Tc,onset. These findings provide valuable insights for the layer-by-layer epitaxy growth of diverse oxide high-temperature superconducting films.

Title: Molecular Beam Epitaxy of 2H-TaS$_2$ few-layers on GaN(0001)
Authors: Constantin Hilbrunner, Tobias Meyer, Joerg Malindretos, Angela Rizzi
Abstract: 2H-TaS$_2$ few layers have been grown epitaxially onto GaN(0001). A high substrate growth temperature of 825$^{\circ}$C induces best structural properties of the overlayer, as revealed by in-situ electron diffraction (RHEED and LEED). The 2D-overlayer grows unstrained right after deposition of a monolayer. However, evidence of pits at the interface is provided by scanning transmission electron microscopy, most probably due to GaN thermal decomposition at the high growth temperature. In-situ x-ray photoemission spectroscopy shows core level shifts that are consistently related to electron transfer from the n-GaN(0001) to the 2H-TaS$_2$ epitaxial layer as well as the formation of a high concentration of nitrogen vacancies close to the interface. Further, no chemical reaction at the interface between the substrate and the grown TaS$_2$ overlayer is deduced from XPS, which corroborates the possibility of integration of 2D 2H-TaS$_2$ with an important 3D semiconducting material like GaN.

Title: Symmetric entanglers for non-invertible SPT phases
Authors: Minyoung You
Abstract: It has been suggested that non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases (SPT), due to the lack of a stacking structure, do not have symmetric entanglers (globally symmetric finite-depth quantum circuits) connecting them. Using topological holography, we argue that a symmetric entangler should in fact exist for $1+1$d systems whenever the non-invertible symmetry has SPT phases connected by fixed-charge dualities (FCD). Moreover, we construct an explicit example of a symmetric entangler for the two SPT phases with $\mathrm{Rep}(A_4)$-symmetry, as a matrix product unitary (MPU).

Title: Spin-Orbit Coupling Effect on the Seebeck Coefficient in Dirac Electron Systems in $α$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$
Authors: Yoshikazu Suzumura, Takao Tsumuraya, Masao Ogata
Abstract: Seebeck coefficient, $S=L_{12}/(TL_{11})$, which is proportional to a ratio of the thermoelectric conductivity $L_{12}$ to the electric conductivity $L_{11}$ with $T$ being temperature is examined for two-dimensional Dirac electrons in a three-quarter filled organic conductor, $\alpha$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$, [BETS = BEDT-TSeF = bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene] at ambient this http URL a tight-binding (TB) model obtained by first-principles relativistic density-functi onal theory method [Eur. Phys. J. B 94, 17 (2021)], we calculate $S$ in the presence of the impurity and electron--phonon (e--p) scatterings. It is shown that $S_x < 0$ and $S_y >0$ at high temperatures, where $S_x$ ($S_y$) denotes $S$ perpendicular (parallel) to the molecular stacking axis. There is a sign change of $S_y$ with increasing $T$. It is found that, at low temperatures the absolute value of $S$ is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling. The Seebeck coefficient is examined by dividing into components of the conduction and valence bands to find that the electron and hole contributions compete each other. Such $T$ dependence of $S$ is clarified using the spectral conductivity, which determines $L_{12}$ and $L_{11}$.

Title: General approach for partitioning and phase separation in macromolecular coexisting phases
Authors: Vikki Anand Varma, Alberto Scacchi
Abstract: Partitioning of (bio)materials in polymeric mixtures is a key phenomenon both in cellular environments, as well as in industrial applications. In cells, several macromolecules are suspended within different biomolecular phases. On the other hand, the coexistence of polymeric aqueous phases has been exploited for the extraction and purification of (bio)materials suspended in water. Despite its relevance, key physical and chemical properties controlling the phase behavior of these complex systems are still lacking. Here, we have developed a classical density functional theory approach for describing the phase coexistence and partitioning of an arbitrary number of polymers and suspended materials. As a case example, we focus on a binary mixture of phase separating polymers in which a third material is dispersed. We explore the effect of size ratios and affinities between the different materials and address their distribution and coexisting densities, and find optimal conditions for partitioning.

Title: Braids and Beams: Exploring Fractional Statistics with Mesoscopic Anyon Colliders
Authors: Bernd Rosenow, Bertrand I. Halperin
Abstract: Anyon colliders -- quantum Hall devices where dilute quasiparticle beams collide at a quantum point contact -- provide an interferometer-free probe of anyonic exchange phases through current cross correlations. Within a non-equilibrium bosonization framework, the normalized cross-correlations take a universal form depending only on the exchange phase and the dynamical exponent, enabling experimental demonstration of anyonic statistics. This result can be interpreted as time-domain interference -- braiding in time rather than spatial exclusion or real-space interferometry. Extension to hierarchical states shows that the semiclassical step-function description of quasiparticles fails at large statistical angles. Introducing a finite soliton width resolves this issue and enables quantitative modeling of charge-$e/5$ quasiparticle collisions.

Title: X-ray imaging of antiferromagnetic octupole domains in Mn$_3$Sn
Authors: Max T. Birch, Sebastian Wintz, Yuhan Sun, Akiko Kikkawa, Markus Weigand, Takahisa Arima, Yoshinori Tokura
Abstract: Novel antiferromagnets with broken time reversal symmetry (TRS) have launched a new direction in spintronics research, combining the advantageous dynamical properties of conventional antiferromagnets with the controllability typically associated with ferromagnets. However, antiferromagnetic domains are notoriously challenging to image in real-space. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) offers a route to overcome this difficulty: XMCD contrast may be finite in TRS-breaking antiferromagnets with an appropriate magnetic space group. Here, we exploit this to image the octupole domains in a focused ion beam-fabricated device of the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn. Using scanning transmission x-ray microscopy, we spatially resolve the weak pre-edge XMCD contrast (of 0.2%) that is sensitive to $T_z$, achieving a contrast resolution better than 0.02%. We observe hysteretic switching of the octupole order through both the XMCD contrast and the corresponding anomalous Hall effect within the same device. These results confirm the bulk nature of this contrast, and establish XMCD-based microscopy as a powerful real space imaging method for TRS-breaking antiferromagnets, including altermagnets, enabling future studies of their dynamics, switching, and symmetry-tunable phenomena.

Title: Quantum-Limited Acoustoelectric Amplification in a Piezoelectric-2DEG Heterostructure
Authors: Eric Chatterjee, Daniel Soh, Matt Eichenfield
Abstract: We provide a quantum mechanical description of phonon amplification in a heterostructure consisting of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) stacked on top of a piezoelectric material. An applied drift voltage effectively creates a population inversion in the momentum states of the 2DEG electrons, giving rise to spontaneous emission of phonons. Once an acoustic wave is launched, the pumped electrons release phonons via stimulated emission, returning to depleted ground states before being pumped back to the excited states. We show that whereas efficient amplification using a 1D electron gas requires the acoustic wavelength to roughly equal the average electron-electron spacing, a 2DEG enables efficient amplification for any wavelength greater than the average electron-electron spacing. We derive the imaginary and real parts of the 2DEG first-order acoustic susceptibility as functions of electronic drift velocity in specific limits and derive the gain per unit length for the signal and the quantum noise, with the gain matching the classical result in the short-electronic-lifetime (low-mobility) regime. Moreover, we analyze the gain clamping due to pump depletion and calculate the maximum achievable intensity. Our results provide a framework for designing novel acoustic devices including a quantum phononic laser and phase-insensitive quantum phononic amplifiers.

Title: Quantifying Charge Noise Sources in Quantum Dot Spin Qubits via Impedance Spectroscopy, DLTS, and C-V Analysis
Authors: Tyafur Rahman Pathan, Daryoosh Vashaee
Abstract: The coherence and fidelity of quantum dot (QD) spin qubits are fundamentally limited by charge noise arising from electrically active trap states at oxide interfaces, heterostructure boundaries, and within the bulk semiconductor. These traps introduce electrostatic fluctuations that couple to the qubit via spin-orbit interactions or charge-sensitive confinement potentials, leading to dephasing and gate errors. In this work, we present a general trap characterization framework for identifying and quantifying the spectral signatures of these trap states using AC impedance spectroscopy, deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), and conventional capacitance-voltage (C-V) analysis. While our case study focuses on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well heterostructures, the approach is broadly applicable to other material systems and qubit types. We demonstrate that each class of traps (oxide interface, quantum well interface, and bulk) exhibits distinct fingerprints across frequency- and time-domain measurements. Oxide traps dominate the low-frequency conductance peaks and appear strongly in Nyquist and transient spectra. QW interface traps, despite being nearly invisible at low densities in conventional C-V and AC impedance analysis, are clearly resolved through multi-exponential decay signatures in time-domain response. Bulk traps contribute to high-frequency admittance and steady-state leakage currents. By correlating each trap type to its characteristic time constant, spatial location, and spectral impact, we provide a diagnostic toolset for disentangling noise sources that degrade qubit performance. This unified methodology bridges traditional defect metrology with emerging qubit noise analysis and enables material- and process-level strategies for coherence optimization in scalable quantum devices.

Title: An efficient and exact noncommutative quantum Gibbs sampler
Authors: Chi-Fang Chen, Michael J. Kastoryano, András Gilyén
Abstract: Preparing thermal and ground states is an essential quantum algorithmic task for quantum simulation. In this work, we construct the first efficiently implementable and exactly detailed-balanced Lindbladian for Gibbs states of arbitrary noncommutative Hamiltonians. Our construction can also be regarded as a continuous-time quantum analog of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. To prepare the quantum Gibbs state, our algorithm invokes Hamiltonian simulation for a time proportional to the mixing time and the inverse temperature $\beta$, up to polylogarithmic factors. Moreover, the gate complexity reduces significantly for lattice Hamiltonians as the corresponding Lindblad operators are (quasi-) local (with radius $\sim\beta$) and only depend on local Hamiltonian patches. Meanwhile, purifying our Lindbladians yields a temperature-dependent family of frustration-free "parent Hamiltonians", prescribing an adiabatic path for the canonical purified Gibbs state (i.e., the Thermal Field Double state). These favorable features suggest that our construction serves as a quantum algorithmic counterpart to classical Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.

Title: Hugoniot equation of state and sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass under shock compression
Authors: Ye Wu, Qing Zhang, Yishi Wang, Yu Hu, Zehui Li, Zining Li, Chang Gao, Xun Liu, Haijun Huang, Yingwei Fei
Abstract: Davemaoite, as the third most abundant mineral in the lower mantle, constitutes significant amounts in pyrolite and mid-ocean ridge basalts. Due to its unquenchable nature, measurements by static compression techniques on physical properties of davemaoite at lower mantle conditions are rare and technically challenging, and those are essential to constrain compositions and properties of mineralogical models in the lower mantle. Here, we present Hugoniot equation of state and sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass under shock compression. The CaSiO3 glass transforms into the crystalline phase above 34 GPa and completely transforms into davemaoite above 120 GPa. Thermal equation of state and Hugoniot temperature of davemaoite have been derived from the shock wave data. The CaSiO3 glass under shcok compression has very high shock temperature. Shock wave experiments for sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass indicate that no melting is observed at Hugoniot pressure up to 117.6 GPa. We propose that the melting temperature of davemaoite should be higher than those reported theoretically by now.

Title: Crosscap Quenches and Entanglement Evolution
Authors: Zixia Wei, Yasushi Yoneta
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms by which complex correlations emerge through the dynamics of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. To address this, quench dynamics starting from nonthermal states have been extensively studied, leading to significant progress. In this paper, we propose a novel quench protocol, termed the "crosscap quench", to investigate how highly structured thermal pure states relax into typical ones. We begin by analyzing conformal field theories (CFTs) and derive universal features in the time evolution of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, leveraging the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study holographic CFTs, providing an analytically tractable example in chaotic CFTs. Finally, we validate these findings through numerical simulations in both nonintegrable and integrable quantum spin systems.

Title: Transmon qutrit-based simulation of spin-1 AKLT systems
Authors: Keerthi Kumaran, Faisal Alam, Norhan Eassa, Kaelyn Ferris, Xiao Xiao, Lukasz Cincio, Nicholas Bronn, Arnab Banerjee
Abstract: Qutrit-based quantum circuits could help reduce the overall circuit depths, and hence the effect of noise, when the system of interest has a local dimension of three. Accessing second excited states in superconducting transmons provides a straightforward hardware realization of qutrits useful for such ternary encoding. In this work, we successfully calibrate microwave pulse gates to a low error rate to operate transmon qutrits. We use these qutrits to simulate one-dimensional spin-1 AKLT states (Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki), which exhibit a multitude of interesting phenomena, such as topologically protected ground states, string order, and the existence of a robust Berry phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of qutrit-based simulation by preparing high-fidelity ground states of the AKLT Hamiltonian with open boundaries for various chain lengths. We then use ground state preparations of the perturbed AKLT Hamiltonian with periodic boundaries to calculate the Berry phase and illustrate non-trivial ground state topology. To establish the advantage of qutrits over qubits in the presence of noise, we present scalable methods for preparing the AKLT state and computing its Berry phase using tensor network simulations. Our work provides a pathway toward more general spin-1 physics simulations using transmon qutrits, with applications in chemistry, magnetism, and topological phases of matter.

Title: Experimental realization of a SU(3) color-orbit coupling in an ultracold gas
Authors: Chetan S. Madasu, Chirantan Mitra, Lucas Gabardos, Ketan D. Rathod, Thomas Zanon-Willette, Christian Miniatura, Frederic Chevy, Chi Kwong, David Wilkowski
Abstract: Spin-orbit interaction couples the spin of a particle to its motion and leads to spin-induced transport phenomena such as spin-Hall effects and Chern insulators. In this work, we extend the concept of internal-external state coupling to higher internal symmetry, exploring features beyond the established spin-orbit regime. We couple suitable resonant laser beams to a gas of ultracold atoms, thereby inducing artificial SU(3) non-Abelian gauge fields that act on a degenerate ground state manifold comprised of three dark states. We demonstrate the inherent all-state connectivity of SU(3) systems by performing targeted geometric transformations. Then, we investigate color-orbit coupling, an extension of SU(2) spin-orbit coupling to SU(3) systems. We reveal a rich dynamical interplay between three distinct oscillation frequencies, which possesses interesting analogies with neutrino oscillations and quark mixing mechanisms. In the future, the system should provide a testbed for exploring topological properties of SU(3) systems.

Title: Dissipation-Driven Transition of Particles from Dispersive to Flat Bands
Authors: Yutao Hu, Chao Yang, Yucheng Wang
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) play a crucial role in condensed matter physics, offering an ideal platform to study strong correlation effects and enabling applications in diffraction-free photonics and quantum devices. However, the study and application of FB properties are susceptible to interference from dispersive bands. Here, we explore the impact of bond dissipation on systems hosting both flat and dispersive bands by calculating the steady-state density matrix. We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.

Title: Digital Twin Simulations Toolbox of the Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in Diamond
Authors: Lucas Tsunaki, Anmol Singh, Sergei Trofimov, Boris Naydenov
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a crucial platform for quantum technologies, where its precise numerical modeling is indispensable for the continued advancement of the field. We present here a Python library for simulating the NV spin dynamics under general experimental conditions, i.e. a digital twin. Our library accounts for electromagnetic pulses and other environmental inputs, which are used to solve the system's time evolution, resulting in a physical output in the form of a quantum observable given by fluorescence. The simulation framework is based on a non-perturbative time-dependent Hamiltonian model, where the states initialization and readout are postulated from the interaction with optical fields. By eliminating oversimplifications such as the adoption of rotating frames for the microwave and radio frequency fields, our simulations reveal subtle dynamics emerging from realistic pulse constraints. The software is illustrated with three examples and validated by comparing the simulations with experimental reports, relevant to the fields of quantum computing (conditional logic gates), sensing (dynamical decoupling sequences with coupled spins) and networks (state teleportation). Overall, this digital twin delivers a robust numerical modeling of the NV spin dynamics, with simple and accessible usability, which can be used for a wide range of applications.

Title: Target-density formation in swarms with stochastic sensing and dynamics
Authors: Jason Hindes, George Stantchev, Klimka Szwaykowska Kasraie, Ira B. Schwartz
Abstract: An important goal for swarming research is to create methods for predicting, controlling and designing swarms, which produce collective dynamics that solve a problem through emergent and stable pattern formation, without the need for constant intervention, and with a minimal number of parameters and controls. One such problem involves a swarm collectively producing a desired (target) density through local sensing, motion, and interactions in a domain. Here, we take a statistical physics perspective and develop and analyze a model wherein agents move in a stochastic walk over a networked domain, so as to reduce the error between the swarm density and the target, based on local, random, and uncertain measurements of the current density by the swarming agents. Using a combination of mean-field, small-fluctuation, and finite-number analysis, we are able to quantify how close and how fast a swarm comes to producing a target as a function of sensing uncertainty, stochastic collision rates, numbers of agents, and spatial variation of the target.

Title: A Statistical Physics perspective on fairness in shared expenses: The bar bill analogy
Authors: Nuno Crokidakis, Lucas Sigaud
Abstract: In social contexts where individuals consume varying amounts, such as shared meals or bar gatherings, splitting the total bill equally often yields surprisingly fair outcomes. In this work, we develop a statistical physics framework to explain this emergent fairness by modeling individual consumption as stochastic variables drawn from a realistic distribution, specifically the gamma distribution. Introducing a Boltzmann-like weighting factor, we derive exact analytical expressions for the partition function, average consumption, variance, and entropy under economic or social penalization constraints. Numerical simulations, performed using the Marsaglia-Tsang algorithm, confirm the analytical results with high precision. Drawing a direct parallel between individual consumption and ideal gas particle energy in the canonical ensemble, we show how the law of large numbers, mutual compensation, and the effective ordering induced by penalization combine to make equal cost-sharing statistically robust and predictable. These findings reveal that what appears to be an informal social convention is, in fact, grounded in the same fundamental principles that govern the collective behavior of particles in thermodynamic systems, highlighting the interdisciplinary power of statistical physics.

Title: Free energy of the Coulomb gas in the determinantal case on Riemann surfaces
Authors: Lucas Bourgoin (IRMA)
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion of the partition function of a Coulomb gas system in the determinantal case on compact Riemann surfaces of any genus g. Our main tool is the bosonization formula relating the analytic torsion and geometric quantities including the Green functions appearing in the definition of this partition function. As a result, we prove the geometric version of the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture in the determinantal case.

Title: Design and Dynamics of High-Fidelity Two-Qubit Gates with Electrons on Helium

Abstract: Systems of individual electrons electrostatically trapped on condensed noble gas surfaces have recently attracted considerable interest as potential platforms for quantum computing. The electrons form the qubits of the system, and the purity of the noble gas surface protects the relevant quantum properties of each electron. Previous work has indicated that manipulation of a confining double-well potential for electrons on superfluid helium can generate entanglement suitable for two-qubit gate operations. In this work, we incorporate a time-dependent tuning of the potential shape to further explore operation of two-qubit gates with the superfluid helium system. Through numerical time evolution, we show that fast, high-fidelity two-qubit gates can be achieved. In particular, we simulate operation of the $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$ and CZ gates and obtain fidelities of 0.999 and 0.996 with execution times of 2.9 ns and 9.4 ns, respectively. Furthermore, we examine the stability of these gate fidelities under non-ideal execution conditions, which reveals new properties to consider in the device design. With the insights gained from this work, we believe that an experimental realization of two-qubit gates using electrons on helium is feasible.

Title: Probability-Phase Mutual Information
Authors: Cameron Hahn, Nishan Ranabhat, Fabio Anza
Abstract: Building on the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics, we develop a coherence theory for ensembles that exploits the probability-phase structure of the quantum state space. Standard coherence measures quantify superposition within density matrices but cannot distinguish ensembles that produce the same mixed state through different distributions of pure states. First, we introduce the probability-phase mutual information $I(P;\Phi)$, which measures statistical correlations between measurement-accessible probabilities and measurement-inaccessible phases across an ensemble. Then, we prove this satisfies the axioms of a coherence monotone, establishing it as a bona-fide measure of ensemble-level coherence. Eventually, through the definition of the \emph{coherence surplus} $\delta_{\mathcal{C}} \geq 0$, we show how ensemble coherence relates to, but exceeds, density-matrix coherence, thus quantifying structure lost in statistical averaging.

Title: Digital quantum simulation of many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model
Authors: Tomoya Hayata, Kazuhiro Seki, Seiji Yunoki
Abstract: Simulating nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. However, a faithful digital quantum simulation of the Hamiltonian evolution is very challenging in the present noisy quantum devices. Instead, nonequilibrium dynamics under the Floquet evolution realized by the Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian evolution with a large Trotter step size is considered to be a suitable problem for simulating in the present or near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose simulating the many-body localization crossover as such a nonequilibrium problem in the disordered Floquet many-body systems. As a demonstration, we simulate the many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice using $60$ qubits from $156$ qubits available in the IBM Heron r2 superconducting qubit device named ibm\_fez. We compute out-of-time-ordered correlators as an indicator of the many-body localization crossover. From the late-time behavior of out-of-time-ordered correlators, we locate the quantum chaotic and many-body localized regimes as a function of the disorder strength. The validity of the results is confirmed by comparing two independent error mitigation methods, that is, the operator renormalization method and zero-noise extrapolation.
