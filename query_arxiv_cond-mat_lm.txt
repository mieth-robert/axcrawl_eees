Title: Lieb-Mattis ordering theorem of electronic energy levels in the thermodynamic limit
Authors: Maunel Calixto, Alberto Mayorgas, Julio Guerrero
Abstract: Lieb-Mattis theorem orders the lowest-energy states of total spin $s$ of a system of $P$ interacting fermions. We generalize these predictions to fermionic mixtures of $P$ particles with more than $N=2$ spinor components/species in the thermodynamic limit $P\to\infty$. The lowest-energy state inside each permutation symmetry sector $h$, arising in the $P$-fold tensor product decomposition, is well approximated by a U$(N)$ coherent (quasi-classical, variational) state, specially in the limit $P\to\infty$. In particular, the ground state of the system belongs the most symmetric (dominant Young tableau $h_0$) configuration. We exemplify our construction with the $N=3$ level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, with a previous motivation on pairing correlations and U$(N)$-invariant quantum Hall ferromagnets. In the limit $P\to\infty$, each lowest-energy state within each permutation symmetry sector $h$ undergoes a quantum phase transition for a critical value $\lambda_c(h)$ of the exchange coupling constant $\lambda$, depending on $h$. This generalizes standard quantum phase transitions and their phase diagrams corresponding to the ground state belonging to the most symmetric sector $h_0$.

Title: Unconventional tunnel magnetoresistance scaling with altermagnets
Authors: Zongmeng Yang, Xingyue Yang, Jianhua Wang, Rui Peng, Lee Ching Hua, Lay Kee Ang, Jing Lu, Yee Sin Ang, Shibo fang
Abstract: In conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) typically increases with barrier thickness as electron transmission in the antiparallel configuration decays faster than that of the parallel configuration. In this work, we reveal an anomalous scaling effect in altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), where the TMR decreases anomalously with an increasing barrier thickness. The anomalous scaling originates from the overlapping spin-split branches form a transmission path that cannot be suppressed in the antiparallel state. Such phenomena is explained by adouble-barrier model and is further demonstrated using ab initio quantum transport simulations in 2D V2Te2O/Cr2Se2O/V2Te2O-based AMTJ, where the TMR anomalously decreases from 220% to 40% as the layer number of Cr2Se2O increases from 1 to 5. Our work identifies a peculiar unexpected transport characteristic of AMTJ, providing a fundamental limit on AMTJ device design and illustrating the potential optimal design of AMTJ at the ultrascaled monolayer limit.

Title: Resolving Intervalley Gaps and Many-Body Resonances in Moiré Superconductor

Abstract: Magic-angle twisted multilayer graphene stands out as a highly tunable class of moiré materials that exhibit strong electronic correlations and robust superconductivity. However, understanding the relations between the low-temperature superconducting phase and the preceding correlated phases established at higher temperatures remains a challenge. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to track the formation sequence of correlated phases established by the interplay of dynamic correlations, intervalley coherence, and superconductivity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG). We discover the existence of two well-resolved gaps pinned at the Fermi level within the superconducting doping range. While the outer gap, previously associated with pseudogap phase, persists at high temperatures and magnetic fields, the newly revealed inner gap is more fragile in line with superconductivity MATTG transport experiments. Andreev reflection spectroscopy taken at the same location confirms a clear trend that closely follows the doping behaviour of the inner gap, and not the outer one. Moreover, spectroscopy taken at nanoscale domain boundaries further corroborates the contrasting behavior of the two gaps, with the inner gap remaining resilient to structural variations, as expected from the finite superconducting coherence length. By comparing our findings with recent topological heavy-fermion models, we identify that the outer gap originates from the splitting of the Abrikosov-Suhl-Kondo resonance due to the breaking of the valley symmetry arising from correlation-driven effects. Our results suggest an intricate but tractable hierarchy of correlated phases in twisted multilayer graphene.

Title: Engineering Altermagnetism via Layer Shifts and Spin Order in Bilayer MnPS$_3$
Authors: J. W. González, T. Brumme, E. Suárez Morell, A. M. León
Abstract: We investigate how stacking configuration and magnetic ordering determine the magnetic phases of bilayer MnPS$_3$, using density-functional theory and spin-Laue symmetry analysis. While monolayer MnPS$_3$ is a collinear antiferromagnet with no spin splitting, our calculations show that the bilayer can host either Type II (AFM) or Type III (altermagnetic) phases depending sensitively on stacking and spin alignment. We focus on two representative stackings: AA, where the top layer sits directly above the bottom one, and AA$^\prime$, its inversion-symmetric counterpart obtained by reflecting one layer about the out-of-plane axis. For each geometry, we consider two collinear spin alignments, $\uparrow\downarrow/\uparrow\downarrow$ and $\uparrow\downarrow/\downarrow\uparrow$, and explore lateral displacements to sample the full stacking landscape. Our results show that magnetic order and interlayer symmetry breaking jointly enable momentum-dependent spin polarization without net magnetization. These findings highlight stacking and spin alignment as coupled symmetry control parameters for engineering altermagnetism in van der Waals magnets, paving the way toward tunable spintronic functionality.

Title: Tunable photogating in a molecular aggregate coupled graphene phototransistor
Authors: Abhinav Raina, Maurizio Sanfilippo, Chang-Ki Moon, Manuel Neubauer, Klaus Meerholz, Malte C. Gather, Klas Lindfors
Abstract: We present a graphene photodetector coupled to a layer of aggregated organic semiconductor. A graphene phototransistor is covered with a thin film of merocyanine molecules. The aggregation of the molecular layer can be controlled by the deposition parameters and post-deposition annealing to obtain films ranging from amorphous to a highly aggregated state. The molecular layer has a uniaxial structure with excitonic transitions whose transition dipole moments are well defined. The presence of the molecular layer results in an enormous increase in the response of the phototransistor. We further demonstrate that the signal-enhancement is due to p-photodoping of the graphene. The spectroscopic photoresponse suggests that the photodoping via monomers and molecular aggregates takes place differently. Our photodetector is a platform to study the influence of molecular aggregation and order on charge transport processes between aggregated organic semiconductors and two-dimensional materials.

Title: Advancing Excited-State Properties of 2D Materials Using a Dielectric-Dependent Hybrid Functional
Authors: Arghya Ghosh, Subrata Jana, Manoar Hossain, Dimple Rani, Szymon Śmiga, Prasanjit Samal
Abstract: Predicting accurate band gaps and optical properties of lower-dimensional materials, including two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials and their heterostructures, remains a challenge within density functional theory (DFT) due to their unique screening compared to their bulk counterparts. Additionally, accurate treatment of the dielectric response is crucial for developing and applying screened-exchange dielectric-dependent range-separated hybrid functionals (SE-DD-RSH) for vdW materials. In this work, we introduce a SE-DD-RSH functional to the 2D vdW materials like MoS2, WS2, hBN, black phosphorus (BP), and \b{eta}-InSe. By accounting for in-plane and out-of-plane dielectric responses, our method achieves accuracy comparable to advanced many-body techniques like G0 W0 and BSE@G0 W0 at a lower computational cost. We demonstrate improved band gap predictions and optical absorption spectra for both bulk and layered structures, including some heterostructures like MoS2/WS2 . This approach offers a practical and precise tool for exploring electronic and optical phenomena in 2D materials, paving the way for efficient computational studies of layered systems.

Title: Self-consistent layer-projected scissors operator for band structures of complex 2D van der Waals materials
Authors: Dario A. Leon, Mikael Kuisma, Mikkel Ohm Sauer, Jakob K. Svaneborg, Mark K. Svendsen, Stefano Americo, Kristian Berland, Jens Jørgen Mortensen, Kristian S. Thygesen
Abstract: We introduce a computationally efficient method to calculate the quasiparticle (QP) band structure of general van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. A layer-projected scissors (LAPS) operator, which depends on the one-body density matrix, is added to the density functional theory (DFT) Hamiltonian. The LAPS operator corrects the band edges of the individual layers for self-energy effects (both intralayer and interlayer) and unphysical strain fields stemming from the use of model supercells. The LAPS operator is treated self-consistently whereby charge redistribution and interlayer hybridization occurring in response to the band energy corrections are properly accounted for. We present several examples illustrating both the qualitative and quantitative performance of the method, including MoS$_2$ films with up to 20 layers, bilayer MoS$_2$ in an electric field, lattice-matched MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ bilayers, and MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ moiré structures. Our work opens the way for predictive modeling of electronic, optical, and topological properties of complex and experimentally relevant vdW materials.

Title: Promoted current-induced spin polarization in inversion symmetry broken topological insulator thin films
Authors: Maryam Heydari, Hanieh Moghaddasi, Mir Vahid Hosseini, Mehdi Askari
Abstract: We theoretically investigate current-induced spin polarization in disordered topological insulator thin films with broken inversion symmetry under an applied in-plane electric field. Utilizing the Kubo formalism within the self-consistent Born approximation, and incorporating vertex corrections to account for multiple scattering events, we analyze how disorder, chemical potential, the electrostatic potential difference between the top and bottom surfaces, and momentum-dependent hybridization affect the spin susceptibility. Our results reveal that the spin susceptibility exhibits nonzero values within a finite range around a zero gap, and this range broadens as the chemical potential increases. A higher hybridization strength induces asymmetry in the spin response, and a stronger potential difference, breaking inversion symmetry, significantly enhances polarization, a trend attributable to band inversion that is further refined by vertex corrections. These findings provide a theoretical framework for tuning spin-charge conversion in topological thin films, with implications for spintronic device applications.

Title: Stochastic Heat Engine Using a Single Brownian Ellipsoid
Authors: Soham Dutta, Arnab Saha
Abstract: Optical tweezers can confine position as well as orientation of a Brownian particle by simultaneously exerting restoring force and torque on it. Here we have proposed the theoretical model of a microscopic Stirling engine, using a passive Brownian ellipsoid as its working substance. The position and the orientation degrees of freedom (DoF) of the ellipsoid in two dimensions (2D), both being confined harmonically by the tweezers, are coupled to a hot and a cold thermal bath time-periodically. The stiffness of the force confinement is also time-periodic such that it resembles a piston-like protocol which drives the Brownian ellipsoid through the strokes of a Stirling cycle. The ellipsoid takes heat from the hot bath and partially converts it into useful thermodynamic work. The extracted work and input heat shows explicit dependence on the shape of the working substance as well as its orientational bias. The operational characteristics of the anisotropic Stirling engine is analyzed using the variance in work and efficiency (in the quasi-static regime), where the latter is bounded by both the Carnot limit as well as the isotropic benchmark. Several ways have been proposed to yield maximum efficiency at a minimum fluctuation in the output. The dissipative coupling between the position and orientation of the ellipsoid, that arises due to its spherical-asymmetry (or, shape anisotropy) and a finite mean orientation, plays an important role to optimize the engine characteristics. Finally, we have analytically explored the slightly anisotropic regime, where the coupling is linearized by suitably tuning the system parameters. The average extracted work has also been calculated in this case, which shows an excellent agreement with the numerical results of the fully anisotropic system, when subjected to the stipulated range of parameters.

Title: Non-excitonic mechanism for electronic and structural phase transitions in Ta2Ni(Se,S)5
Authors: Weichen Tang, Zhenglu Li, Cheng Chen, Yu He, Steven G. Louie
Abstract: We present a first-principles study based on density functional theory (DFT) on the electronic and structural properties of Ta2NiSe5, a layered transition metal chalcogenide that has been considered as a possible candidate for an excitonic insulator. Our systematic DFT results however provide a non-excitonic mechanism for the experimentally observed electronic and structural phase transitions in Ta2NiSe5, in particular explaining why sulfur substitution of selenium reduces the distortion angle in the low-temperature phase and potassium dosing closes the gap in the electronic structure. Moreover, the calculations show that these two effects couple to each other. Further, our first-principles calculations predict several changes in both the crystal structure and electronic structure under the effects of uniform charge dosing and uniaxial strain, which could be tested experimentally.

Title: Quantum geometric origin of Meissner effect and superfluid weight marker
Authors: David Porlles, Wei Chen
Abstract: The momentum space of conventional superconductors is recently recognized to possess a quantum metric defined from the overlap of filled quasihole states at neighboring momenta. For multiband superconductors with arbitrary intraband and interband $s$-wave pairing, we elaborate that their superfluid weight in London equations is given by the momentum integration of the elements of quantum metric times the quasiparticle energy, indicating the quantum geometric origins of Meissner effect and vortex state. The momentum integration of the quantum metric further yields a spread of quasihole Wannier functions that characterizes the stability of the superconducting state. Our formalism allows the diamagnetic response of conventional superconductors to be mapped to individual lattice sites as a superfluid weight marker, which can incorporate the effect of disorder through self-consistently solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. Using single-band $s$-wave superconductors in 2D and 3D as examples, our marker reveals a diamagnetic current that becomes turbulent in the presence of nonmagnetic impurities, and the increase of London penetration depth by disorder that is consistent with experiments.

Abstract: Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and superior quality factor. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state. This work highlights the potential of dark cavities devoid of external photons for engineering electronic ground-state properties of materials using IR-active phonons.

Title: Mechanics of three-dimensional micro-architected interpenetrating phase composites
Authors: Andrew Y. Chen, Carlos M. Portela
Abstract: Composite materials are used across engineering applications for their superior mechanical performance, a result of efficient load transfer between the structure and matrix phases. However, the inherently two-dimensional structure of laminated composites reduces their robustness to shear and out-of-plane loads, while unpredictable interlaminar failure and fiber pull-out can cause a catastrophic loss of load capacity. Meanwhile, advances toward uncovering structure-property relations in architected materials have led to highly tunable mechanical properties, deformation, and even failure. Some of these architected materials have reached near-theoretical limits; however, the majority of current work focuses on describing the response of a single-material network in air, and the effect of adding a load-bearing second phase to a three-dimensional architecture is not well understood. Here, we develop facile fabrication methods for realizing centimeter-scale polymer- and carbon-based architected interpenetrating phase composite (IPC) materials, i.e., two-phase materials consisting of a continuous 3D architecture surrounded by a load-bearing matrix across length scales, and determine the effect of geometry and constituent material properties on the mechanics of these architected IPCs. Using these experiments together with computational models, we show that the matrix phase distributes stress effectively, resulting in a high-strength, stable response. Notably, failure delocalization enhances energy dissipation of the composite, achieving specific energy absorption (SEA) values comparable to those of wound fiber tubes. Finally, we demonstrate that the stress state in an IPC can be tuned using geometric design and introduce an example in an architected composite. Altogether, this work bridges the gap between mechanically efficient composites and tunable architected materials.

Title: Emergence of Anti-chemotactic Flocking in Active Biomimetic Colloids

Abstract: Competition for resources is a fundamental constraint that guides the self-organization of natural, biological, and human systems, ranging from urban planning and ecosystem development to intracellular pattern formation. Here, we reveal that competition for resources is at the origin of the collective dynamics that emerge in a population of colloids propelled by actin treadmilling, an out-of-equilibrium process where filaments grow from one end while shrinking from the other. Using a combination of experiments and theory, we show that symmetry-breaking, self-propulsion, and flocking emerge from the local competition for actin monomers. We demonstrate that beads propelled by actin treadmilling are anti-chemotactic and spontaneously generate asymmetric actin gradients that trigger and sustain directed motility. Flocking emerges from the combined effects of anti-chemotaxis and local competition for monomers. The flocking transition depends on the actin polymerization rate, actin monomer diffusivity, and the bead's motility, whose interplay controls the emergence of short-range attractive interactions between the colloids. Our findings demonstrate that active stress generation coupled to reaction-diffusion is a generic mechanism that can lead to a multiscale cascade of behaviors when active agents remodel their environment. Actin treadmilling offers a platform to study how motile agents that interact through a field self-organize in novel dynamical phases, with potential applications in non-reciprocal and trainable active matter.

Title: Cross-scale Modeling of Polymer Topology Impact on Extrudability through Molecular Dynamics and Computational Fluid Dynamics
Authors: Yawei Gao, Jan Michael Carrillo, Logan T. Kearney, Polyxeni P. Angelopoulou, Nihal Kanbargi, Arit Das, Michael Toomey, Bobby G. Sumpter, Joshua T. Damron, Amit K Naskar
Abstract: Understanding how polymer topology influences melt extrudability is critical for advancing material design in extrusion-based additive manufacturing. In this work, we develop a bottom-up, cross-scale modeling framework that integrates coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) and continuum-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to quantitatively assess the effects of polymer architecture on extrudability A range of branched polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymers are systematically designed by varying backbone length, sidechain length, grafting density, grafted block ratio, and periodicity of grafted-ungrafted segments. CGMD simulations are used to compute zero-shear viscosity and relaxation times, which are then incorporated into the Phan-Thien-Tanner (PTT) model within a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to predict pressure drop of PDMS during extrusion through printer nozzle. Qualitative analysis reveals that polymers with concentrated grafted blocks exhibit significantly higher zero-shear viscosity than stochastically branched analogs, while sidechain inertia drives longer relaxation time. However, for untangled and weakly entangled PDMS, relaxation time remains in the nanosecond range, making shear-thinning and elastic effects negligible. Consequently, zero-shear viscosity emerges as the primary determinant of extrudability. This cross-scale modeling strategy provides a predictive framework for guiding the rational design of extrudable polymer materials with tailored topologies.

Title: Condensate Fraction Scaling and Specific Heat Anomaly around Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition of Superconductivity and Superfluidity
Authors: Yuan-Yao He
Abstract: Characterizing the superconducting and superfluid transitions in two-dimensional (2D) many-body systems is of broad interest and remains a fundamental issue. In this study, we establish the {\it condensate fraction} as a highly effective tool to achieve that and accordingly propose efficient schemes for accurately determining the transitions, via numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Using the 2D attractive Fermi-Hubbard model as a testbed, we access unprecedented system sizes (up to 4096 lattice sites) and perform a comprehensive analysis for the temperature dependence and finite-size scaling of {\it condensate fraction} across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. We demonstrate that this quantity exhibits algebraic scaling below the transition and exponential scaling above it, with significantly smaller finite-size effect comparing to the extensively studied on-site pairing correlator. This greatly improves the determination of BKT transition with moderate system sizes. We also extract the finite-size BKT transition temperature from condensate fraction, and confirm its logarithmic correction on system size. Furthermore, we find that the specific heat displays an anomaly, showing a peak at a temperature slightly above BKT transition. Our findings should be generally applicable to 2D fermionic and bosonic systems hosting superconductivity or superfluidity.

Title: Resonance-enhanced Floquet cavity electromagnonics
Authors: Amin Pishehvar, Zixin Yan, Zhaoyou Wang, Yu Jiang, Yizhong Huang, Josep M. Jornet, Liang Jiang, Xufeng Zhang
Abstract: Floquet engineering has been recently recognized as an important tool for manipulating the coherent magnon-photon interaction in cavity electromagnonics systems at microwave frequencies. In spite of the novel hybrid magnonic functionalities that have been demonstrated, the effect of the Floquet drive has been relatively weak due to the limited driving efficiency, limiting its broader application. This work shows that by utilizing LC resonances, the Floquet drive in our cavity electromagnonic device can be drastically enhanced, giving rise to drastically boosted interaction between hybrid modes with fundamentally different spectral characteristics compared with previous demonstrations. In addition, the Floquet drives can also be obtained from GHz signals on such a system, allowing the demonstration of more advanced signal operations. Our novel resonance-enhanced Floquet cavity electromagnonics points to a new direction to fully unleash the potential of Floquet hybrid magnonics.

Title: Cubic ReSTe as a High-Performance Thermoelectric Material
Authors: Haruka Matsumoto, Hiroto Isomura, Keita Kojima, Ryutaro Okuma, Hironori Ohshima, Chul-Ho Lee, Youichi Yamakawa, Yoshihiko Okamoto
Abstract: We report thermoelectric properties of sintered samples of undoped, W-doped, and Sb-doped ReSTe crystallized in a cubic MoSBr-type structure. All samples exhibited p-type thermoelectric properties. ReSTe and Re0.993W0.007STe exhibited the largest dimensionless figure of merit ZT, reaching 0.4 at 660 K. This high performance is attributed to large power factor owing to the degenerate semiconducting state realized by the strong spin-orbit coupling and low lattice thermal conductivity of the sintered samples. Furthermore, electronic band dispersion of ReSTe is almost flat at the bottom of the conduction band, suggesting that n-type ReSTe is expected to exhibit much higher performance than p-type ReSTe.

Title: The Discovery Engine: A Framework for AI-Driven Synthesis and Navigation of Scientific Knowledge Landscapes
Authors: Vladimir Baulin, Austin Cook, Daniel Friedman, Janna Lumiruusu, Andrew Pashea, Shagor Rahman, Benedikt Waldeck
Abstract: The prevailing model for disseminating scientific knowledge relies on individual publications dispersed across numerous journals and archives. This legacy system is ill suited to the recent exponential proliferation of publications, contributing to insurmountable information overload, issues surrounding reproducibility and retractions. We introduce the Discovery Engine, a framework to address these challenges by transforming an array of disconnected literature into a unified, computationally tractable representation of a scientific domain. Central to our approach is the LLM-driven distillation of publications into structured "knowledge artifacts," instances of a universal conceptual schema, complete with verifiable links to source evidence. These artifacts are then encoded into a high-dimensional Conceptual Tensor. This tensor serves as the primary, compressed representation of the synthesized field, where its labeled modes index scientific components (concepts, methods, parameters, relations) and its entries quantify their interdependencies. The Discovery Engine allows dynamic "unrolling" of this tensor into human-interpretable views, such as explicit knowledge graphs (the CNM graph) or semantic vector spaces, for targeted exploration. Crucially, AI agents operate directly on the graph using abstract mathematical and learned operations to navigate the knowledge landscape, identify non-obvious connections, pinpoint gaps, and assist researchers in generating novel knowledge artifacts (hypotheses, designs). By converting literature into a structured tensor and enabling agent-based interaction with this compact representation, the Discovery Engine offers a new paradigm for AI-augmented scientific inquiry and accelerated discovery.

Title: Superinsulating behavior in granular Pb film on gated few-layer MoS$_2$
Authors: Suraina Gupta, Santu Prasad Jana, Pawan Kumar Gupta, Anjan K. Gupta
Abstract: We report a super-insulating behavior, in a device having granular Pb film on back-gated few-layer $\mathrm{MoS_2}$, below an onset temperature same as the critical temperature $T_{\rm C}\approx7$ K of bulk Pb. Below $T_{\rm C}$, the current-voltage characteristics exhibit a threshold voltage marking a crossover between the low-bias insulating and the high-bias normal-resistance states, consistent with the known super-insulating state behavior. A temperature dependent critical magnetic field is also found above which the insulating behavior is suppressed. The threshold voltage is found to vary with the gate-voltage but the critical field remains unchanged. With reducing temperature, the sample conductance saturates to a finite value, which depends on magnetic field and gate-voltage. This saturation behavior is found to be inconsistent with the charge-BKT and the thermal activation models but it can be fitted well to a combination of thermal activation and quantum fluctuations.

Title: Activity-enhanced shear thinning of flexible linear polar polymers
Authors: Arindam Panda, Roland G. Winkler, Sunil P. Singh
Abstract: The rheological properties of tangentially propelled flexible polymers under linear shear flow are studied by computer simulations and are compared with analytical calculations. We find a significant impact of the coupled nonequilibrium active and shear forces on the polymer characteristics. The polar activity enhances shear-induced stretching along the flow direction, shrinkage in the transverse direction, and implies a strongly amplified shear-thinning behavior. The characteristic shear rate for the onset of these effects is determined by the activity. In the asymptotic limit of large activities, the shear-induced features become independent of activity, and for asymptotically large shear rates, shear dominates over activity with passive polymer behavior.

Title: Global optimisation of the control strategy of a Brownian information Engine: Efficient information-energy exchange in a generalised potential energy surface
Authors: Rafna Rafeek, Debasish Mondal
Abstract: An information engine harnesses energy from a single heat bath, utilising the gathered information. This study explores the best control strategy of a Brownian information engine (BIE), confined in a potential energy surface (PES) of arbitrary shape, and experiencing a measurement outcome-based feedback cycle. The feedback site corresponds to an instantaneous shift in the potential centre to an additional feedback distance over the measurement outcome. The strategy for the most efficient information-to-energy conversion is achieved when the position of the global potential minimum corresponds to the additional feedback distance. The BIE acts as a heater if and only if the average potential energy is higher than the energy at the additional feedback distance. Operating under confinement PES of different shapes, the BIE can harness energy beyond the average potential energy, and multiple heater-refrigerator re-entrance events are feasible. The consequences of the best control strategy are explained using sufficient examples.

Title: Multi-shot readout error benchmark of the nitrogen-vacancy center's electronic qubit
Authors: Péter Boross, Domonkos Svastits, Győző Egri, András Pályi
Abstract: The ground-state electronic spin of a negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond can be used for room-temperature experiments showing coherent qubit functionality. At room temperature, photoluminescence-based qubit readout has a low single-shot fidelity; however, the populations of the qubit's two basis states can be inferred using multi-shot readout. In this work, we calculate the dependence of the error of a multi-shot inference method on various parameters of the readout process. This multi-shot readout error scales as $\Delta/\sqrt{N}$, with $N$ being the number of shots, suggesting to use the coefficient $\Delta$ as a simple multi-shot readout error benchmark. Our calculation takes into account background photons, photon loss, and initialization error. Our model enables the identification of the readout error budget, i.e., the role various imperfections play in setting the readout error. Our results enable experimentalists and engineers to focus their efforts on those hardware improvements that yield the highest performance gain for multi-shot readout.

Title: Improved imaging of magnetic domains with a photoelectron emission microscope by utilizing symmetry and momentum selection
Authors: F. O. Schumann, M. Paleschke, J. Henk, W. Widdra, C.-T. Chiang
Abstract: Imaging of magnetic domains with a photoelectron emission microscope operated with photon energies in the threshold regime often suffers from low contrast. In this work we show by symmetry considerations, photoemission calculations, and imaging experiments, how the contrast can be improved significantly. The key to both domain selectivity and sizable intensity asymmetries is, guided by symmetry considerations, selecting the momenta of the photoelectrons by a properly positioned contrast aperture. By comparing computational with experimental results for an Fe(001) surface we prove the feasibility of the approach.

Title: Universal momentum tail of identical one-dimensional anyons with two-body interactions
Authors: Raúl Hidalgo-Sacoto, Thomas Busch, D. Blume
Abstract: Non-relativistic anyons in 1D possess generalized exchange statistics in which the exchange of two identical anyons generates a non-local phase that is governed by the spatial ordering of the particles and the statistical parameter $\alpha$. Working in the continuum, we demonstrate the existence of two distinct types of 1D anyons, namely bosonic anyons and fermionic anyons. We identify a many-body Hamiltonian with additive two-body zero-range interactions that supports bosonic and fermionic anyon eigenstates, which are, for arbitrary interaction strength, related through a generalized bosonic-anyon--fermionic-anyon mapping, an extension of the celebrated Bose-Fermi mapping for zero-range interacting 1D systems. The momentum distributions of bosonic and fermionic anyons are distinct: while both feature $k^{-2}$ and $k^{-3}$ tails, the associated prefactors differ. Our work reveals intricate connections between the generalized exchange statistics, the universal two- and three-body Tan contacts of systems consisting of $N$ identical particles, and the emergence of statistics-induced chiral symmetry breaking.

Abstract: Lateral microsegregation in a monolayer of a binary mixture of particles or macromolecules is studied by MD simulations in a generic model with the interacting potentials inspired by effective interactions in biological or soft-matter systems. In the model, the energy is minimized when like particles form small clusters, and the cross-interction is of opposite sign. We show that the laterally microsegregated components in the dense ordered phases form alternating stripes for similar densities, or the clusters of the minority component fill the hexagonally distributed voids formed in the dense phase of the majority component. A qualitative phase diagram in the plane of densities of the two components is constructed for low temperatures. An addition of the second component significantly enlarges the temperature range of the stability of the ordered phases compared to the stability of these phases in the one-component system. At higher temperatures, the disordered phase consisting of individual particles, one-component clusters and two-component super-clusters of various sizes is stable. The product kn(k), with n(k) denoting the average number of super-clusters composed of k particles, decays exponentially with k, and the inverse decay rate depends linearly on temperature.

Title: Contribution of shears on vibrational entropy
Authors: Bocquet Jean-Louis
Abstract: Calculating the vibrational entropy of an N-atom assembly in the harmonic approximation requires the diagonalisation of a large matrix. This operation becomes rapidly time consuming when increasing the dimensions of the simulation cell. In the studies of point defects, a widely used shortcut consists in calculating the eigen modes of the atoms contained in an inner region, called the defective region, while the atoms belonging to the outer region are held fixed, and in applying an elastic correction to account for the entropy stored in the distortion of the outer region. A recent paper proposed to base the correction on the local pressure change experienced by each lattice site. The present contribution is an extension in the sense that it includes the shears. We compared the two approximations for configurations which are currently encountered in defect studies, namely those pertaining to defect formation and migration. The studied defects are the single, di- and tri-vacancy as well as the dumbbell interstitial in a host matrix modelled by several empirical potentials mimicking pure copper. It is shown that the inclusion of shears brings a noticeable contribution to the elastic correction for all configurations of low symmetry.

Title: Anatomy of spin-orbit-torque-assisted magnetization dynamics in Co/Pt bilayers: Importance of the orbital torque
Authors: Harshita Devda, András Deák, Leandro Salemi, Levente Rózsa, László Szunyogh, Peter M. Oppeneer, Ulrich Nowak
Abstract: Understanding the mechanism driving magnetization switching in spin-orbit-torque-assisted devices remains a subject of debate. While originally attributed to the spin Hall effect and spin Rashba-Edelstein effect, recent discoveries related to orbital moments induced by the orbital Hall effect and the orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect have added complexity to the comprehension of the switching process in non-magnet/ferromagnet bilayers. Addressing this challenge, we present a quantitative investigation of a Pt/Co bilayer by employing atomistic spin dynamics simulations, incorporating the proximity-induced moments of Pt, as well as electrically induced spin and orbital moments obtained from first-principles calculations. Our layer-resolved model elucidates the damping-like and field-like nature of the induced moments by separating them according to their even and odd magnetization dependence. In addition to demonstrating that a larger field-like spin-orbit torque contribution comes from previously disregarded induced orbital moments, our work highlights the necessity of considering interactions with Pt induced moments at the interface, as they contribute significantly to the switching dynamics.

Title: Star-like thermoresponsive microgels: a new class of soft nanocolloids
Authors: Elisa Ballin, Francesco Brasili, Tommaso Papetti, Jacopo Vialetto, Michael Sztucki, Simona Sennato, Marco Laurati, Emanuela Zaccarelli
Abstract: We provide experimental and numerical evidence of a new class of soft nanocolloids: star-like microgels with thermoresponsive character. This is achieved by using the standard precipitation polymerization synthesis of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels and replacing the usually employed crosslinking agent, N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) (BIS), with ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA). The fast reactivity of EGDMA combined with its strong tendency to self-bind produces colloidal networks with a central, crosslinker-rich core, surrounded by a corona of long, crosslinker-free arms. These novel star-like microgels fully retain PNIPAM thermoresponsivity and undergo a volume phase transition at a temperature of 32°C that is very sharp as compared to standard PNIPAM-BIS microgels, independently of crosslinker content. Dynamic light scattering and small angle X-ray scattering experiments are compared to extensive simulation results, based on ideal star polymers as well as on state-of-the-art monomer-resolved simulations, offering a microscopic evidence of the star-like internal structure of PNIPAM-EGDMA microgels. This can be described by a novel model for the form factors combining star and microgel features. The present work thus bridges the fields of star polymers and microgels, providing the former with the ability to respond to temperature via a facile synthetic route that can be routinely employed, opening the way to exploit these soft particles for a variety of fundamental studies and applicative purposes.

Title: Near-Unity Charge Readout in a Nonlinear Resonator without Matching
Authors: Harald Havir, Andrea Cicovic, Pierre Glidic, Subhomoy Haldar, Sebastian Lehmann, Kimberly A. Dick, Ville F. Maisi
Abstract: In this paper, we present a nonlinear resonator performing the readout of a charge-sensing quantum dot. We show that by driving the resonator in the nonlinear regime, we achieve a near-unity signal. This despite not satisfying the impedance matching requirements necessary for such large signals in the linear regime. Our experiments, supported by numerical calculations, demonstrate that the signal increase stems from the sensor dissipation shifting the onset of the nonlinear resonator response. By lifting the matching requirement, we increase the bandwidth limit of resonator readout-based charge detection by an order of magnitude, opening up the avenue to ultra-fast charge detectors.

Title: Inverse thermal anisotropy in CdMgO measured using photothermal infrared radiometry and thermoreflectance
Authors: Misha Khalid, Ankur Chatterjee, Ewa Przezdziecka, Abinash Adhikari, Monika Stanke, Aleksandra Wierzbicka, Carlos J. Tavares, Michał Pawlak
Abstract: This study elucidates the intriguing phenomenon of inverse thermal anisotropy in cadmium magnesium oxide (CdMgO) thin films, characterized by cross-plane thermal conductivity being greater than in-plane thermal conductivity, essential for optimizing thermal management in next-generation optoelectronic devices. Herein, we utilized Photothermal Radiometry and Frequency Domain Thermoreflectance to precisely determine the thermal conductivity and diffusivity across various concentrations of magnesium in CdMgO alloys, thereby providing essential insights into thermophysical behavior. Atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction revealed a direct correlation between increasing magnesium content and progressive structural evolution within plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy-derived CdMgO alloys. Furthermore, heat transport mechanism, analyzed using Callaway and Abeles models, indicated key phonon interactions. This comprehensive investigation provides a framework for the precise control of CdMgO thin film thermal properties, paving the way for scalable fabrication strategies to optimize performance in high-power thermal management applications.

Title: Polarization Vortices in a Ferromagnetic Metal via Twistronics

Abstract: Recent advances in moire engineering provide new pathways for manipulating lattice distortions and electronic properties in low-dimensional materials. Here, we demonstrate that twisted stacking can induce dipolar vortices in metallic SrRuO3 membranes, despite the presence of free charges that would normally screen depolarizing fields and dipole-dipole interactions. These polarization vortices are correlated with moire-periodic flexoelectricity induced by shear strain gradients, and exhibit a pronounced dependence on the twist angle. In addition, multiferroic behavior emerges below the ferromagnetic Curie temperature of the films, whereby polarization and ferromagnetism coexist and compete, showing opposite twist-angle dependencies of their respective magnitudes. Density functional theory calculations provide insights into the microscopic origin of these observations. Our findings extend the scope of polarization topology design beyond dielectric materials and into metals.

Title: Symmetry breaking and thermal phase transition of the spin-1 quantum magnet with SU(3) symmetry on the simple cubic lattice
Authors: Nils Caci, Dominik Chudy, Pablo Daniel Mendez Mariscal, Daniel Ueltschi, Stefan Wessel
Abstract: Using a combined analysis from Poisson-Dirichlet and symmetry-breaking calculations as well as quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the ordered phase and the thermal phase transition of the three-dimensional spin-1 quantum magnet on the simple cubic lattice with bilinear and biquadratic interactions and SU(3) internal symmetry. We obtain exact results for the order parameter distribution function that compare well to the quantum Monte Carlo data. Furthermore, based on a detailed finite-size analysis, we provide evidence that the thermal melting transition at the SU(3) point is either weakly first-order in this system or, if continuous, it falls beyond the unitary-bounds of conformal field theory.

Title: Efficient method for magnetic structure exploration based on first-principles calculations: application to MnO and hexagonal ferrites SrFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$
Authors: Taro Fukazawa, Haruki Okumura, Tetsuya Fukushima, Hisazumi Akai, Takashi Miyake
Abstract: We propose an approach for exploring magnetic structures by using Liechtenstein's method for exchange couplings from the results of first-principles calculations. Our method enables efficient and accurate exploration of stable magnetic structures by greatly reducing the number of firstprinciples calculations required. We apply our method to the magnetic structures of MnO and hexagonal ferrite SrFe12O19. Our method correctly identifies the ground-state magnetic structure with a small number of first-principles calculations in these systems.

Title: Fine-tuning the dispersion of active suspensions with oscillatory flows
Authors: Hakan Osman Caldag, Martin Alan Bees
Abstract: The combined impact of axial stretching and cross-stream diffusion on the downstream transport of solute is termed Taylor dispersion. The dispersion of active suspensions is qualitatively distinct: viscous and external torques can establish non-uniform concentration fields with weighted access to shear, modifying mean drift and effective diffusivity. It would be advantageous to fine-tune the dispersion for systems such as bioreactors, where mixing or particle separation can improve efficacy. Here, we investigate the dispersion of active suspensions in a vertical channel driven by an oscillatory pressure gradient - Womersley flow - using gyrotactic swimmers (bottom-heavy cells subject to viscous torques). Preliminary experimental results reveal interesting dispersion phenomena, highly dependent on the oscillation parameters, motivating theoretical investigation. Employing Lagrangian simulations, we find that oscillatory flows can induce drift and increase lateral and downstream dispersion, with periodic mixing between left and right sides. Such flows can also be used to separate species with different motile behaviour. Eulerian numerical schemes typically require an approach to averaging in orientational space, such as generalised Taylor dispersion, with assumptions on translational and rotational time scales. For an oscillatory timescale commensurate with cell dynamics, we reveal the limitations of such approximations, beyond which the averaging techniques collapse.

Title: Light-Driven Bound State of Interacting Impurities in a Dirac-Like Bath
Authors: Vinayak M. Kulkarni
Abstract: Recent investigations have revealed the presence of exceptional points in the low-energy effective spin-interacting impurity model, previously explored via non-Hermitian renormalization group (RG) techniques. These studies uncovered novel RG fixed points and linked them to distinct transport signatures. In this work, we revisit the model from a real-time field-theoretic perspective, studying both non-interacting and strongly correlated ($U = \infty$) limits using the exact equation of motion and a Large-$N$ Keldysh variational mean-field approach. Remarkably, we find that the steady-state solutions of the Keldysh action exhibit the same fixed point structure as the RG flows, independently recovering the exceptional behavior. Our analysis further reveals that exceptional points (EPs) arise naturally in the Green's function structure without any ad hoc non-Hermitian terms and are associated with self-consistent light-induced hybridization in specific regimes. Importantly, we identify a new causal steady state in which the appearance of EPs is not inherently tied to causality violation; instead, a sign-reversing (negative) flip hybridization contribution restores causality. These findings suggest a broader framework in which EPs coexist with well-defined dynamical behavior and open the door to controlled light-driven engineering of dissipative quantum impurity states.

Title: The bridge function as a functional of the radial distribution function: Operator learning and application
Authors: Martin Panholzer, Michael Haring, Thomas Wallek, Robert E. Zillich
Abstract: Properties of classical molecular systems can be calculated with integral equation theories based on the Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) equation and a complementing closure relation. One such closure relation is the hyper netted chain (HNC) approximation, which neglects the so-called bridge function. We present a new way to use machine learning to train a deep operator network to predict the bridge function, based on the radial distribution function as input. Bridge functions for the Lennard-Jones fluid are calculated from Monte Carlo simulations in a wide range of densities and temperatures. These results are used to train the deep operator network. This network is employed to improve the HNC closure by the prediction for the bridge function, and the resulting set of equations is solved iteratively. For assessment, we compare the radial distribution function and the pressure, calculated by the viral expression, with Monte Carlo results and standard HNC. We demonstrate that incorporating the neural network based bridge function in the closure relation leads to substantially improved predictions. Universality of our method is demonstrated by comparing results for the hard sphere fluid, calculated with our model trained on the Lennard-Jones fluid, with exact hard sphere results, showing overall good agreement.

Title: Relationship of structural disorder and stability of supercooled liquid state with glass-forming ability of metallic glasses
Authors: J.B. Cui, R.A. Konchakov, G.V. Afonin, A.S. Makarov, G.J. Lyu, J.C.Qiao, N.P. Kobelev, V.A. Khonik
Abstract: We performed calorimetric studies of 26 metallic glasses and calculated the excess entropy and excess enthalpy with respect to their counterpart crystals. On this basis, we introduced a dimensionless entropy-based parameter {\sigma}scl, which characterizes structural disordering and stability of the supercooled liquid state upon heating. A very good correlation of {\sigma}scl with literature data on the critical cooling rate Rc and critical diameter Dmax of metallic glasses is shown. We also introduced another dimensionless parameter {\eta}scl based on the excess enthalpy of glass and showed that {\eta}scl provides equally good correlation with Rc and Dmax. Possible relationship of structural disordering and glass-forming ability in the supercooled liquid range with the defect structure of glass is discussed. The obtained results provide a new window for the understandingof the glass-forming ability of metallic glasses.

Title: Subsystem localization
Authors: Arpita Goswami, Pallabi Chatterjee, Ranjan Modak, Shaon Sahoo
Abstract: We consider a ladder system where one leg, referred to as the ``bath", is governed by an Aubry-André (AA) type Hamiltonian, while the other leg, termed the ``subsystem", follows a standard tight-binding Hamiltonian. We investigate the localization properties in the subsystem induced by its coupling to the bath. For the coupling strength larger than a critical value ($t'>t'_c$), the analysis of the static properties show that there are three distinct phases as the AA potential strength $V$ is varied: a fully delocalized phase at low $V$, a localized phase at intermediate $V$, and a weakly delocalized (fractal) phase at large $V$. An analysis of the wavepacket dynamics shows that the delocalized phase exhibits a ballistic behavior, whereas the weakly delocalized phase is subdiffusive. Interestingly, we also find a superdiffusive narrow crossover regime along the line separating the delocalized and localized phases. When $t'<t'_c$, the intermediate localized phase disappears, and we find a delocalized (ballistic) phase at low $V$ and a weakly delocalized (subdiffusive) phase at large $V$. Between those two phases, there is also a crossover regime where the system can be super- or subdiffusive. Finally, in some limiting scenario, we also establish a mapping between our ladder system and a well-studied one-dimensional generalized Aubry-André (GAA) model.

Title: Anisotropic spin-polarized conductivity in collinear altermagnets
Authors: Mingbo Dou, Xianjie Wang, L. L. Tao
Abstract: The altermagnet exhibits the nonrelativistic spin splitting that enables all-electrical generation of spin-polarized currents beyond the spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report on a study on the anisotropic spin-polarized conductivity in collinear altermagnets. Based on the Boltzmann transport theory, we first study this effect using the general group-theoretical analysis and identify the spin point groups sustaining the finite spin polarization defined in terms of spin-polarized conductivity. We show that the spin polarization vanishes along any direction for the $g$-wave and $i$-wave altermagnets while the spin polarization is significantly anisotropic for the $d$-wave altermagnet. We further derive the analytical expressions for the anisotropic spin polarization in the $d$-wave altermagnets. Then, we exemplify those phenomena in several representative altermagnets based on the density functional theory calculations. Our work enriches the altermagnetic spintronics and paves the practical way to produce large spin polarization in collinear altermagnets.

Title: Non-isothermal stress relaxation in conventional and high-entropy metallic glasses and its relationship to themixing and excess entropy
Authors: G.V. Afonin, S.L. Scherbakov, R.A. Konchakov, N.P. Kobelev, J.B. Cui, J.C. Qiao, V.A. Khonik
Abstract: We performed calorimetric and torsion stress relaxation measurements upon linear heating of six conventional and high-entropy metallic glasses with the mixing entropy {\Delta}Smix ranging from 0.86R to 1.79R (R is the universal gas constant). It is shown that high-entropy metallic glasses ({\Delta}Smix > 1.5 R) exhibit significantly greater resistance to stress relaxation. Based on calorimetric data, we calculated the excess entropy of glass relative to the counterpart crystalline state and introduced an entropy-based dimensionless parameter {\Delta}S, which characterizes the rise of the entropy and structural disordering of glass in the supercooled liquid region. It is shown that the depth of stress relaxation at a given temperature decreases with {\Delta}Smix but increases with {\Delta}S. Possible reasons for this relationship are discussed.

Title: In-plane polarization induced ferroelectrovalley coupling in a two-dimensional rare-earth halide
Authors: Srishti Bhardwaj, T. Maitra
Abstract: We propose a mechanism where the valley splitting is caused by an in-plane electric polarization and the coupling between the two makes it possible for an electric field to control the valley degree of freedom. We demonstrate this by considering Gd-substituted EuCl$_2$ monolayer in its 1T-phase using first-principles calculations. This monolayer exhibits an in-plane polarization which breaks the inversion symmetry of the monolayer leading to a spontaneous valley splitting. The resulting valley polarization is strongly coupled with the electric polarization and, hence, the valley degree of freedom can be switched by an external electric field in this case, instead of the conventional magnetic field. We show that a similar ferroelectric-ferrovalley (FE-FV) coupling can also exist in the previously reported ferroelectric (CrBr$_3$)$_2$Li monolayer. This mechanism opens up a new avenue for electric field control of valley polarization in two-dimensional materials.

Title: Tunability of the magnetic properties in Ni intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide NbSe$_2$
Authors: Xujia Gong, Amar Fakhredine, Carmine Autieri
Abstract: Ni$_{0.33}$NbSe$_2$ has been identified as an altermagnet with a Neel temperature of 84 K, although Ni$_{0.21}$NbSe$_2$ behaves like a nonmagnetic metal. In this work, we explore the magnetic phases of Ni-intercalated NbSe$_2$ with stoichiometry Ni$_{0.25}$NbSe$_2$, which lies between the two previously studied compositions. Our results reveal a transition in the ground state from a stripe antiferromagnetic phase with Kramers degeneracy to a ferromagnetic phase (above UC).In the Kramers antiferromagnetic state, the nearest-neighbour magnetic coupling is ferromagnetic between the layers and forms stripe-like patterns in the ab plane. This behavior contrasts with that of Ni$_{0.33}$NbSe$_2$ where the nearest-neighbour magnetic couplings are opposite, and the magnetic easy axis aligns along the z-axis. The strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the second-nearest neighbor coupling stabilize the Kramers antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases with spins aligned along the z-axis over the non-collinear 120 phase with in-plane spin orientations. Given the triangular lattice and the closeness to both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling, a metamagnetic transition is possible. Substantial modifications to the electronic structure accompany Ni intercalation in NbSe$_2$ with respect to the pristine phase. Compared to pristine NbSe$_2$, which features a hole pocket at the $\Gamma$ point, the stripe phase of Ni$_{0.25}$NbSe$_2$ instead exhibits an electron pocket at $\Gamma$. This pocket at $\Gamma$ has predominantly 3z$^2$-r$^2$ character, and derives its main spectral weight from the Nb atoms. Ni intercalation also shifts the Van Hove singularity away from the Fermi level, thereby suppressing potential electronic instabilities.

Title: Majorana vortex phases in time-reversal invariant higher-order topological insulators and topologically trivial insulators
Authors: Xunjiang Luo
Abstract: Majorana vortex phases have been extensively studied in topological materials with conventional superconducting pairing. Inspired by recent experimental progress in realizing time-reversal invariant higher-order topological insulators (THOTIs) and inducing superconducting proximity effects, we investigate Majorana vortex phases in these systems. We construct THOTIs as two copies of a topological insulator (TI) with time-reversal symmetry-preserving mass terms that anisotropically gap the surface states. We find that these mass terms have a negligible impact on the vortex phase transitions of double TIs when treated as perturbations, and no additional topological phase transitions are induced. Consequently, $\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Majorana vortex end modes (MVEMs) emerge when the chemical potential lies between the critical chemical potentials $\mu_c^{(1)}$ and $\mu_c^{(2)}$ of the two TI vortex phase transitions. We demonstrate this behavior across multiple THOTI models, including rotational symmetry-protected THOTI, inversion symmetry-protected THOTI, rotational and inversion symmetries-protected THOTI bismuth, and extrinsic THOTI. Remarkably, MVEMs persist even when all surfaces are gapped with the same sign, rendering the system topologically trivial in both first- and second-order classifications. Our findings establish that MVEMs can be realized in time-reversal invariant systems with fully gapped surfaces, encompassing both topologically nontrivial and trivial insulators, thus significantly broadening the solid state material platforms for hosting Majorana vortex phases.

Title: Efficient local atomic cluster expansion for BaTiO$_3$ close to equilibrium
Authors: Anna Grünebohm, Matous Mrovec, Maxim N. Popov, Lan-Tien Hsu, Yury Lysogorskiy, Anton Bochkarev, Ralf Drautz
Abstract: Barium titanate (BTO) is a representative perovskite oxide that undergoes three first-order ferroelectric phase transitions related to exceptional functional properties. In this work, we develop two atomic cluster expansion (ACE) models for BTO to reproduce fundamental properties of bulk as well as defective BTO phases. The two ACE models do not target full transferability but rather aim to examine the influence of implicit and explicit treatment of long-range Coulomb interactions. We demonstrate that both models describe equally well the temperature induced phase transitions as well as polarization switching due to applied electric field. Even though the parametrizations are based on a limited number of configurations that are mostly not far away from the equilibrium, the ACE models are able to capture also properties of important crystal defects, such as oxygen vacancies, stacking faults and domain walls. A systematic comparison shows that the phase transitions as well as the fundamental properties of the investigated defects can be described with similar accuracy with or without explicit treatment of charges and Coulomb interactions allowing for efficient short-range machine learning potentials.

Title: Liouvillian skin effects in two-dimensional electron systems at finite temperatures
Authors: Yuta Shigedomi, Tsuneya Yoshida
Abstract: Liouvillian skin effects, manifested as the localization of Liouvillian eigenstates around the boundary, are distinctive features of non-Hermitian systems and are particularly notable for their impact on system dynamics. Despite their significance, Liouvillian skin effects have not been sufficiently explored in electron systems. In this work, we demonstrate that a two-dimensional electron system on a substrate exhibits $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Liouvillian skin effects due to the interplay among energy dissipations, spin-orbit coupling, and a transverse magnetic field. In addition, our analysis of the temperature dependence reveals that these Liouvillian skin effects become pronounced below the energy scale of band splitting induced by the spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic field. While our Liouvillian skin effect leads to charge accumulation under quench dynamics, its relaxation time is independent of the system size, in contrast to that of previously reported Liouvillian skin effects. This difference is attributed to the scale-free behavior of the localization length, which is analogous to non-Hermitian critical skin effects.

Tsirlin, Daniel Haskel, Michael J. Graf, Fazel Tafti
Abstract: Magnetic exchange interactions are mediated via orbital overlaps across chemical bonds. Thus, modifying the bond angles by physical pressure or strain can tune the relative strength of competing interactions. Here we present a remarkable case of such tuning between the Heisenberg (J) and Kitaev (K) exchange, which respectively establish magnetically ordered and spin liquid phases on a honeycomb lattice. We observe a rapid suppression of the Neel temperature (TN) with pressure in Ag3LiRh2O6, a spin-1/2 honeycomb lattice with both J and K couplings. Using a combined analysis of x-ray data and first-principles calculations, we find that pressure modifies the bond angles in a way that increases the |K/J| ratio and thereby suppresses TN. Consistent with this picture, we observe a spontaneous onset of muon spin relaxation (muSR) oscillations below TN at low pressure, whereas in the high-pressure phase, oscillations appear only when T < TN/2. Unlike other candidate Kitaev materials, Ag3LiRh2O6 is tuned toward a quantum critical point by pressure while avoiding a structural dimerization in the relevant pressure range.

Title: Emergent reactance induced by the deformation of a current-driven skyrmion lattice
Authors: Matthew T. Littlehales, Max T. Birch, Akiko Kikkawa, Yasujiro Taguchi, Diego Alba Venero, Peter D. Hatton, Naoto Nagaosa, Yoshinori Tokura, Tomoyuki Yokouchi
Abstract: The interaction between conduction electrons and spin textures gives rise to remarkable phenomena associated with the Berry phase. The Berry phase acquired by conduction electrons acts as an emergent electromagnetic field, facilitating phenomena analogous to classical electromagnetism, such as the Lorentz force and electromagnetic induction. Magnetic skyrmions, spin vortices with non-trivial topology, serve as a key platform for such studies. For example, non-trivial transport responses are recognized as being induced by the emergent Lorentz force and the emergent electromagnetic induction. Despite remarkable progress in skyrmion physics, emergent reactance, in which the phase of an applied AC current is modified by emergent electromagnetism, has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we report emergent reactance in the prototypical skyrmion-hosting material, MnSi. We observe longitudinal and Hall reactance signals as the skyrmion lattice undergoes creep motion, in which the skyrmions deform while moving. The Hall reactance is attributed to the emergent electric field associated with the inertial translational motion arising from the skyrmion effective mass. In contrast, the longitudinal reactance results from the emergent electric fields generated by the phason and spin-tilting modes excited by their deformation. Our findings shed light on the internal deformation degrees of freedom in skyrmions as a important factor for efficient generation of the emergent electric field.

Title: Plasmon-Driven Giant Amplification of Ultrashort Spin Current
Authors: H. Y. Yuan, Rembert A. Duine
Abstract: A key challenge in spintronics is to efficiently generate and manipulate spin current for information processing. Here we study ultrashort spin transport and associated terahertz (THz) emission in a hybrid structure comprising gold nanoparticles, a ferromagnet (FM) and a normal metal (NM) and show that plasmon excitation in the nanoparticles strongly enhances the electron-magnon scattering rate through heating effects, thereby amplifying the spin current generation at the FM$|$NM interface. This effect is even more pronounced when the FM is an insulator with a thickness much smaller than the nanoparticle size. In this case, the gold nanoparticle and NM substrate form a nanocavity with the FM as a dielectric layer, trapping plasmons inside the gap. The resulting spin current can be amplified by two orders of magnitude as compared to the case without plasmon excitations. Our findings provide a novel route to design efficient spintronic THz devices and further open the door to the interdisciplinary field of spintronics and nanophotonics.

Title: Dilute Paramagnetism and Non-Trivial Topology in Quasicrystal Approximant Fe$_4$Al$_{13}$
Authors: Keenan E. Avers, Jarryd A. Horn, Ram Kumar, Shanta R. Saha, Yuanfeng Xu, B. Andrei Bernevig, Peter Zavalij, Johnpierre Paglione
Abstract: A very fundamental property of both weakly and strongly interacting materials is the nature of its magnetic response. In this work we detail the growth of crystals of the quasicrystal approximant Fe$_4$Al$_{13}$ with an Al flux solvent method. We characterize our samples using electrical transport and heat capacity, yielding results consistent with a simple non-magnetic metal. However, magnetization measurements portray an extremely unusual response for a dilute paramagnet and do not exhibit the characteristic Curie-Weiss behavior expected for a weakly interacting material at high temperature. Electronic structure calculations confirm metallic behavior, but also indicate that each isolated band near the Fermi energy hosts non-trivial topologies including strong, weak and nodal components, with resultant topological surface states distinguishable from bulk states on the (001) surface. With half-filled flat bands apparent in the calculation but absence of long-range magnetic order, the unusual paramagnetic response suggests the dilute paramagnetic behavior in this quasicrystal approximant is surprising and may serve as a test of the fundamental assumptions that are taken for granted for the magnetic response of weakly interacting systems.

Title: Preferential attachment and power-law degree distributions in heterogeneous multilayer hypergraphs
Authors: Francesco Di Lauro, Luca Ferretti
Abstract: We include complex connectivity structures and heterogeneity in models of multilayer networks or multilayer hypergraphs growing by preferential attachment. We consider the most generic connectivity structure, where the probability of acquiring a new hyperlink depends linearly on the vector of hyperdegrees of the node across all layers, as well as on the layer of the new hyperlink and the features of both linked nodes. We derive the consistency conditions that imply a power-law hyperdegree distribution for each class of nodes within each layer and of any order. For generic connectivity structures, we predict that the exponent of the power-law distribution is universal for all layers and all orders of hyperlinks, and it depends exclusively on the type of node.

Title: Recovering Hidden Degrees of Freedom Using Gaussian Processes
Authors: Georg Diez, Nele Dethloff, Gerhard Stock
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction represents a crucial step in extracting meaningful insights from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Conventional approaches, including linear methods such as principal component analysis as well as various autoencoder architectures, typically operate under the assumption of independent and identically distributed data, disregarding the sequential nature of MD simulations. Here, we introduce a physics-informed representation learning framework that leverages Gaussian Processes combined with variational autoencoders to exploit the temporal dependencies inherent in MD data. Time-dependent kernel functions--such as the Matérn kernel--directly impose impose the temporal correlation structure of the input coordinates onto a low-dimensional space, preserving Markovianity in the reduced representation while faithfully capturing the essential dynamics. Using a three-dimensional toy model, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully identify and separate dynamically distinct states that are geometrically indistinguishable due to hidden degrees of freedom. The resulting embedding features enhance metastability, facilitating the construction of Markov state models with smaller lag times and better convergence of implied timescales. This time-aware perspective provides a promising framework for understanding complex biomolecular systems, in which conventional collective variables may fail to capture the full dynamical picture.

Title: Explaining the extra crystal field mode in ACeX2
Authors: Allen O. Scheie, Sabrina J. Li, Stephen D. Wilson, Daniel A. Rehn
Abstract: A growing list of Ce-based magnets have shown an extra and heretofore unexplained crystal electric field (CEF) mode at high energies. We describe a process whereby an optical phonon can produce a split CEF mode well above the phonon energy. We use density functional theory and point-charge model calculations to estimate the phonon distortions and coupling to model this effect in KCeO$_2$, showing that it accounts for the extra CEF mode observed. This mechanism is generic, and may explain the extra modes observed on a variety of Ce$^{3+}$ compounds.

Title: Ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory via mapping to point particles
Authors: Jitendra Kethepalli, Andrew Urilyon, Tridib Sadhu, Jacopo De Nardis
Abstract: Ballistic Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory (BMFT) captures the evolution of fluctuations and correlations in systems where transport is strictly ballistic. We show that, for \emph{generic integrable models}, BMFT can be constructed through a direct mapping onto ensembles of classical or quantum point particles. This mapping generalises the well-known correspondence between hard spheres and point particles: the two-body \emph{scattering shift} now plays the role of an effective rod length for arbitrary interactions. Within this framework, we re-derive both the full-counting statistics and the long-range correlation functions previously obtained by other means, thereby providing a unified derivation. Our results corroborate the general picture that all late-time fluctuations and correlations stem from the initial noise, subsequently convected by Euler-scale hydrodynamics.

Title: Rotational Multi-material 3D Printing of Soft Robotic Matter with Asymmetrical Embedded Pneumatics
Authors: Jackson K. Wilt, Natalie M. Larson, Jennifer A. Lewis
Abstract: The rapid design and fabrication of soft robotic matter is of growing interest for shape morphing, actuation, and wearable devices. Here, we report a facile fabrication method for creating soft robotic materials with embedded pneumatics that exhibit programmable shape morphing behavior. Using rotational multi-material 3D printing, asymmetrical core-shell filaments composed of elastomeric shells and fugitive cores are patterned in 1D and 2D motifs. By precisely controlling the nozzle design, rotation rate, and print path, one can control the local orientation, shape, and cross-sectional area of the patterned fugitive core along each printed filament. Once the elastomeric matrix is cured, the fugitive cores are removed, leaving behind embedded conduits that facilitate pneumatic actuation. Using a connected Fermat spirals pathing approach, one can automatically generate desired print paths required for more complex soft robots, such as hand-inspired grippers. Our integrated design and printing approach enables one to rapidly build soft robotic matter that exhibits myriad shape morphing transitions on demand.

Title: A new generation of effective core potentials: Selected lanthanides and heavy elements II
Authors: Omar Madany, Benjamin Kincaid, Aqsa Shaikh, Elizabeth Morningstar, Lubos Mitas
Abstract: We present a new set of correlation-consistent effective core potentials (ccECPs) for selected heavy $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$-block elements significant in materials science and chemistry (Rb, Sr, Cs, Ba, In, Sb, Pb, Ru, Cd, La, Ce, and Eu). The ccECPs are designed using minimal Gaussian parameterization to achieve smooth and bounded potentials. They are expressed as a combination of averaged relativistic effective potentials (AREP) and effective spin-orbit (SO) terms, developed within a relativistic coupled-cluster framework. The optimization is driven by correlated all-electron (AE) atomic spectra, norm-conservation, and spin-orbit splittings, with considerations for plane wave cut-offs to ensure accuracy and viability across various electronic configurations. Transferability of these ccECPs is validated through testing on molecular oxides and hydrides, emphasizing discrepancies in molecular binding energies across a spectrum of bond lengths and electronic environments. The ccECPs demonstrate excellent agreement with AE reference calculations, attaining chemical accuracy in bond dissociation energies and equilibrium bond lengths, even in systems characterized by substantial relativistic and correlation effects. These ccECPs provide accurate and transferable framework for valence-only calculations.

Title: Nucleation and Antiphase Twin Control in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ via Step-Terminated Al$_2$O$_3$ Substrates

Zac Ward, Vitalii Starchenko, Nicholas Cucciniello, Robert G. Moore, Gyula Eres, Yue Cao, Debangshu Mukherjee, Christopher Nelson, Danielle Reifsnyder Hickey, Fei Xue, Matthew Brahlek
Abstract: The epitaxial synthesis of high-quality 2D layered materials is an essential driver of both fundamental physics studies and technological applications. Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a prototypical 2D layered topological insulator, is sensitive to defects imparted during the growth, either thermodynamically or due to the film-substrates interaction. In this study, we demonstrate that step-terminated Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates with a high miscut angle (3$^\circ$) can effectively suppress a particular hard-to-mitigate defect, the antiphase twin. Systematic investigations across a range of growth temperatures and substrate miscut angles confirm that atomic step edges act as preferential nucleation sites, stabilizing a single twin domain. First principles calculations suggest that there is a significant energy barrier for twin boundary formation at step edges, supporting the experimental observations. Detailed structural characterization indicates that this twin-selectivity is lost through the mechanism of the 2D layers overgrowing the step edges, leading to higher twin density as the thickness increases. These findings highlight the complex energy landscape unique to 2D materials that is driven by the interplay between substrate topology, nucleation dynamics, and defect formation, and overcoming and controlling these are critical to improve material quality for quantum and electronic applications.

Title: Higher-order topological phases protected by non-invertible and subsystem symmetries
Authors: Aswin Parayil Mana, Yabo Li, Hiroki Sukeno, Tzu-Chieh Wei
Abstract: Higher-order topological phases with invertible symmetries have been extensively studied in recent years, revealing gapless modes localized on boundaries of higher codimension. In this work, we extend the framework of higher-order symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases to include non-invertible symmetries. We construct a concrete model of a second-order SPT phase in $2+1$ dimensions that hosts symmetry-protected corner modes protected by a non-invertible symmetry. This construction is then generalized to a $d^{th}$-order SPT phase in $d+1$ dimensions, featuring similarly protected corner modes. Additionally, we demonstrate a second-order SPT phase in $3+1$ dimensions exhibiting hinge modes protected by a non-invertible symmetry.

Title: Multiparty entanglement loops in quantum spin liquids
Authors: Liuke Lyu, Deeksha Chandorkar, Samarth Kapoor, So Takei, Erik S. Sørensen, William Witczak-Krempa
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) give rise to exotic emergent particles by weaving intricate entanglement patterns in the underlying electrons. Bipartite measures between subregions can detect the presence of anyons, but little is known about the full entanglement structure of QSLs. Here, we study the multiparty entanglement of QSLs via entanglement microscopy. We find that in contrast to conventional matter, the genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) between spins is absent in the smallest subregions, a phenomenon we call "entanglement frustration". Instead, GME is more collective, and arises solely in loops. By exploiting exact results and large-scale numerics, we confirm these properties in various gapped and gapless QSLs realised in physically motivated Hamiltonians, as well as with string-net wavefunctions hosting abelian or non-abelian anyons. Our results shed new light on the phase diagram of Kitaev's honeycomb model in a Zeeman field, and the Kagome Heisenberg model under various perturbations. Going beyond QSLs, we provide evidence that entanglement loops are a universal property of quantum gauge theories. This leads to a new understanding of fractionalization, and the means by which gauge bosons encode quantum information.

Title: Tuning Thermal Conductivity and Electron-Phonon Interactions in Carbon and Boron Nitride Moiré Diamanes via Twist Angle Manipulation
Authors: Rustam Arabov, Nikita Rybin, Victor Demin, Mikhail Polovinkin, Alexander Kvashnin, Leonid Chernozatonskii, Alexander Shapeev
Abstract: We have investigated the effect of interlayer twist angle on the in-plane lattice thermal conductivity and the band gap renormalization in diamane-like hydrogenated bilayer boron nitride (BN) and graphene Moiré lattices. Machine learning moment tensor potentials were used for calculating energies and forces of interatomic interactions. The methods based on the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for phonons and the Green-Kubo (GK) formula were utilized to obtain LTC values. The 20-40\% difference in LTC values obtained with GK and BTE-based methods showed the importance of high-order anharmonic contributions to LTC in the BN-based lattice with $\theta=21.8^\circ$ and all considered graphene-based structures. Significant reduction (by 4.5 - 9 times) of the in-plane LTC with the increase in the twist angle was observed in the Moiré lattices. This LTC reduction is caused by the decrease of phonon lifetimes. The phonon lifetimes decrease due to the growth of structural disorder in the Moiré lattices with the twist angle increase. We also show that the growth of disorder with increasing twist angle affects the electron-phonon interactions. This leads to higher band gap renormalization (induced by classical nuclei motion) at higher twist angles. High band gap renormalization (even at T = 0 K) values obtained considering the quantum nuclear effects are caused by the high frequencies of lattice vibrations in the Moiré lattices. These high frequencies are caused by the presence of light hydrogen atoms on the surfaces of the structures. Understanding of the twist-angle-induced disorder effect on phonon properties, LTC and electron-phonon coupling in the Moiré lattices provides a fundamental basis for manipulating the thermal and electronic properties of these structures, making them promising for applications in thermoelectrics, microelectronics and optoelectronics.

Title: Effect of Fluorine doping on the electrocatalytic properties of Nb2O5 for H2O2 electrogeneration
Authors: Aline B. Trench, João Paulo C. Moura, Caio Machado Fernandes, Mauro C. Santos
Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via the 2-electron mechanism is an efficient way to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under mild conditions. This study examines the modification of Vulcan XC72 carbon with fluorine (F)-doped niobium oxide (Nb2O5) nanoparticles at varying molar ratios (0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02). The F-doped Nb2O5 nanoparticles were synthesized using the oxidizing peroxide method and then incorporated into Vulcan XC72 carbon via impregnation. Characterization techniques included X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), contact angle measurements, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electrochemical evaluation using the rotating ring disk electrode method revealed that Vulcan XC72 modified with 1.0% F-doped Nb2O5 exhibited the best ORR performance. When used as a gas diffusion electrode, this electrocatalyst produced more H2O2 at all applied potentials than the pure and Nb2O5-modified Vulcan XC72 carbon. At potentials of -0.7 V and -1.3 V, the proposed electrocatalyst achieved H2O2 yields 65% and 98% higher than the Nb2O5-modified electrocatalyst. Furthermore, it presented lower energy consumption and higher current efficiency than the other electrocatalysts compared in this study. The enhanced performance is attributed to F doping, which increased Nb2O5 lattice distortion and disorder, improving electron availability for ORR. Additionally, F-doped electrocatalysts exhibited more oxygenated species and greater hydrophilicity, facilitating O2 adsorption, transport, and electron transfer. These properties significantly enhanced H2O2 electrogeneration efficiency while reducing energy consumption.

Title: INN-FF: A Scalable and Efficient Machine Learning Potential for Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Taskin Mehereen, Sourav Saha, Intesar Jawad Jaigirdar, Chanwook Park
Abstract: The ability to accurately model interatomic interactions in large-scale systems is fundamental to understanding a wide range of physical and chemical phenomena, from drug-protein binding to the behavior of next-generation materials. While machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have made it possible to achieve ab initio-level accuracy at significantly reduced computational cost, they still require very large training datasets and incur substantial training time and expense. In this work, we propose the Interpolating Neural Network Force Field (INN-FF), a novel framework that merges interpolation theory and tensor decomposition with neural network architectures to efficiently construct molecular dynamics potentials from limited quantum mechanical data. Interpolating Neural Networks (INNs) achieve comparable or better accuracy than traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters. On benchmark datasets such as liquid water and rMD17, INN-FF not only matches but often surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy by an order of magnitude, while achieving significantly lower error when trained on smaller datasets. These results suggest that INN-FF offers a promising path toward building efficient and scalable machine-learned force fields.

Title: Stochastic agent-based Monte Carlo simulations for reaction-diffusion models, population dynamics, and epidemic spreading
Authors: Mohamed Swailem, Ulrich Dobramysl, Ruslan Mukhamadiarov, Uwe C. Täuber
Abstract: We provide a succinct overview of the implementation of Monte Carlo algorithms based on Markovian stochastic dynamics to study interacting and reacting many-particle systems away from thermal equilibrium. Such agent-based computer simulations constitute an effective tool to introduce undergraduate and beginning graduate students to current frontier research without requiring much prior knowledge or experience: Starting from direct visualization of simulation data, students may gain immediate insight into emerging macroscopic features of a complex model system and subsequently apply more sophisticated data analysis to quantitatively characterize its often rich dynamical properties, both in stationary and transient regimes. We utilize numerical investigations of paradigmatic reaction-diffusion systems, as well as stochastic models for population dynamics and epidemic spreading, to exemplify how interdisciplinary computational research can be effectively utilized in bottom-up undergraduate and graduate education through learning by doing. In addition, we give helpful hints for the practical setup of Monte Carlo simulation algorithms, provide sample codes, explain some typical data analysis tools, and describe various potential error sources and pitfalls, with tips for avoiding them.

Title: Prethermalization, shadowing breakdown, and the absence of Trotterization transition in quantum circuits
Authors: Marko Znidaric
Abstract: One of premier utilities of present day noisy quantum computers is simulation of many-body quantum systems. We study how long in time is such a discrete-time simulation representative of a continuous time Hamiltonian evolution, namely, a finite time-step introduces so-called Trotterization errors. We show that the truncated operator propagator (Ruelle-Pollicott resonances) is a powerful tool to that end, as well as to study prethermalization and discrete time crystals, including finding those phenomena at large gate duration, and can be used to calculate diffusion constant. We show that the effective energy is more stable than suggested by Trotter errors -- a manifestation of prethermalization -- while all other observables are not. Even such the most stable observable though deteriorates in the thermodynamic limit. Different than in classical systems with the strongest chaos, where the faithfulness time (the shadowing time) can be infinite, in quantum many-body chaotic systems it is finite. A corollary of our results is also that, opposite to previous claims, there is no Trotterization transition in non-integrable many-body quantum systems.

Title: Global Optimization Through Heterogeneous Oscillator Ising Machines
Authors: Ahmed Allibhoy, Arthur N. Montanari, Fabio Pasqualetti, Adilson E. Motter
Abstract: Oscillator Ising machines (OIMs) are networks of coupled oscillators that seek the minimum energy state of an Ising model. Since many NP-hard problems are equivalent to the minimization of an Ising Hamiltonian, OIMs have emerged as a promising computing paradigm for solving complex optimization problems that are intractable on existing digital computers. However, their performance is sensitive to the choice of tunable parameters, and convergence guarantees are mostly lacking. Here, we show that lower energy states are more likely to be stable, and that convergence to the global minimizer is often improved by introducing random heterogeneities in the regularization parameters. Our analysis relates the stability properties of Ising configurations to the spectral properties of a signed graph Laplacian. By examining the spectra of random ensembles of these graphs, we show that the probability of an equilibrium being asymptotically stable depends inversely on the value of the Ising Hamiltonian, biasing the system toward low-energy states. Our numerical results confirm our findings and demonstrate that heterogeneously designed OIMs efficiently converge to globally optimal solutions with high probability.

Title: Acceleration of enzymatic reaction-diffusion kinetics by intermediate state
Authors: Akihiro Fukuda, Yohei Nakayama, Shoichi Toyabe
Abstract: Biological molecular motors are high-performance nanomachines that convert chemical energy into mechanical motion via chemomechanical coupling. Their reaction cycles typically comprise a series of intermediate chemical states between the initial and final primary states. However, the influence of these intermediate states on motor performance has not yet been fully explored. In this study, we investigate the impact of intermediate states on the motor kinetics using a reaction-diffusion model. In most cases, the intermediate states accelerate the motor by lowering the effective barrier height. This acceleration is particularly pronounced when an external load is applied to the motor, implying the practical importance of the intermediate states. The intermediate states can also slow down the reaction in some cases, such as the slow reaction limit with asymmetric kinetics. Our findings provide practical insights into the design principles behind the high performance of biological molecular motors, as well as the development of efficient artificial molecular motors.

Title: Lindblad evolution as gradient flow
Authors: Greg Kaplanek, Alexander Maloney, Jason Pollack, Dylan VanAllen
Abstract: We give a simple argument that, for a large class of jump operators, the Lindblad evolution can be written as a gradient flow in the space of density operators acting on a Hilbert space of dimension $D$. We give explicit expressions for the (matrix-valued) eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Lindblad evolution using this formalism. We argue that in many cases the interpretation of the evolution is simplified by passing from the $D^2$-dimensional space of density operators to the $D^2-1$-dimensional space of Bloch vectors. When jump operators are non-Hermitian the evolution is not in general gradient flow, but we show that it nevertheless resembles gradient flow in two particular ways. Importantly, the steady states of Lindbladian evolution are still determined by the potential in all cases.

Title: Quantum Mpemba effect without global symmetries
Authors: Tanmay Bhore, Lei Su, Ivar Martin, Aashish A. Clerk, Zlatko Papić
Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a system initially farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than one closer to equilibrium, has been extensively studied in classical systems and recently explored in quantum settings. While previous studies of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) have largely focused on isolated systems with global symmetries, we argue that the QME is ubiquitous in generic, non-integrable many-body systems lacking such symmetries, including U(1) charge conservation, spatial symmetries, and even energy conservation. Using paradigmatic models such as the quantum Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields, we show that the QME can be understood through the energy density of initial states and their inverse participation ratio in the energy eigenbasis. Our findings provide a unified framework for the QME, linking it with classical thermal relaxation and phenomena such as prethermalization and weak ergodicity breaking.

Title: Role of Nonstabilizerness in Quantum Optimization
Authors: Chiara Capecci, Gopal Chandra Santra, Alberto Bottarelli, Emanuele Tirrito, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: Quantum optimization has emerged as a promising approach for tackling complicated classical optimization problems using quantum devices. However, the extent to which such algorithms harness genuine quantum resources and the role of these resources in their success remain open questions. In this work, we investigate the resource requirements of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) through the lens of the resource theory of nonstabilizerness. We demonstrate that the nonstabilizerness in QAOA increases with circuit depth before it reaches a maximum, to fall again during the approach to the final solution state -- creating a barrier that limits the algorithm's capability for shallow circuits. We find curves corresponding to different depths to collapse under a simple rescaling, and we reveal a nontrivial relationship between the final nonstabilizerness and the success probability. Finally, we identify a similar nonstabilizerness barrier also in adiabatic quantum annealing. Our results provide deeper insights into how quantum resources influence quantum optimization.

Title: Circuit structure-preserving error mitigation for High-Fidelity Quantum Simulations
Authors: Ruizhe Shen, Tianqi Chen, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: Developing methods to accurately characterize and mitigate the impact of noise is crucial for enhancing the fidelity of quantum simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we present a circuit structure-preserving error mitigation framework for parameterized quantum circuits. A key advantage of our approach lies in its ability to retain the original circuit architecture while effectively characterizing and mitigating gate errors, enabling robust and high-fidelity simulations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we perform variational quantum simulations of a non-Hermitian ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising chain on IBM Quantum processors. The mitigated result shows excellent agreement with exact theoretical predictions across a range of noise levels. Our strategy offers a practical solution for addressing gate-induced errors and significantly broadens the scope of feasible quantum simulations on current quantum hardware.

Title: A high-resolution molecular spin-photon interface at telecommunications wavelengths
Authors: Leah R. Weiss, Grant T. Smith, Ryan A. Murphy, Bahman Golesorkhi, José A. Méndez Méndez, Priya Patel, Jens Niklas, Oleg G. Poluektov, Jeffrey R. Long, David D. Awschalom
Abstract: Optically addressable electronic spins in polyatomic molecules are a promising platform for quantum information science with the potential to enable scalable qubit design and integration through atomistic tunability and nanoscale localization. However, optical state- and site-selection are an open challenge. Here we introduce an organo-erbium spin qubit in which narrow (MHz-scale) optical and spin transitions couple to provide high-resolution access to spin degrees of freedom with telecommunications frequency light. This spin-photon interface enables demonstration of optical spin polarization and readout that distinguishes between spin states and magnetically inequivalent sites in a molecular crystal. Operation at frequencies compatible with mature photonic and microwave devices opens a path for engineering scalable, integrated molecular spin-optical quantum technologies.

Title: Membrane-Associated Self-Assembly for Cellular Decision Making
Authors: Samuel L. Foley, Margaret E. Johnson
Abstract: Cellular decision-making based on information received from the external environment is frequently initiated by transmembrane receptors. These receptors are known to propagate such information by triggering a series of irreversible, energy-consuming reactions. While this active mechanism ensures switch-like responses, here we show how spontaneous molecular self-assembly on a two-dimensional substrate can similarly act as a tunable and robust switch for detecting receptors at physiological concentrations. This mechanism is much more sensitive than other passive mechanisms for receptor detection. We derive analytical expressions for critical receptor densities that switch on nucleation and growth of assemblies, in close agreement with equilibrium stochastic reaction-diffusion simulations. The theory developed provides testable predictions for how each component controls decision thresholds and magnitude of response.

Title: Polariton cascade phonon laser
Authors: I. Papuccio-Fernández, A. A. Reynoso, A. E. Bruchhausen, A. S. Kuznetsov, K. Biermann, P.V. Santos, G. Usaj, A. Fainstein
Abstract: Phonon lasers, as their photon counterparts, rely on the physics of stimulated emission. Arguably, because light does not require a material substrate to propagate, while sound does, the impact of the two technologies has however been highly contrasting, with "sasers" (for sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) mostly remaining as an academic curiosity. This might be changing due to the possibility to use coherent sound generation for on-chip processing of information at ultra-high frequencies, and in the quantum realm, in integrated photonic and optomechanical devices. Inspired by the concept of unipolar lasers based on the quantum engineering of states in semiconductor heterostructures, we propose and implement a quantum cascade phonon laser (QCPL). A condensate of exciton-photon quasiparticles (polaritons) is optically induced in a microstructured semiconductor device to jump down a ladder of engineered levels. This down-cascade is accompanied by the efficient stimulated emission of phonons of $\sim 20$, $\sim 60$, and $\sim 100$~GHz, which are designed to strongly interact with the polaritons on the same chip. The proposed concept opens the path for the design of integrated high-frequency optomechanical devices, as for example for non-reciprocal photon transport and multi-wavelength Brillouin lasers.

Title: Increasing the Resistance of Magnetic Flux Concentrator during Generation of Strong Pulsed Magnetic Fields
Authors: P. A. Russkikh, G. Sh. Boltachev
Abstract: The possibility of significant increase of generated pulsed magnetic fields by the inductor system of a single-turn solenoid and magnetic flux concentrator without initialization of low-cycle fatigue mechanism is theoretically studied by varying the size of the inductor system, the material of the concentrator and the parameters of the discharge circuit. The analysis is carried out on the basis of self-consistent solution of the equation, which describes dynamics of the discharge electric circuit, with equations describing spatial distributions of magnetic and temperature fields, mechanical stresses and deformations in the inductor and concentrator. It is shown that for traditionally used steel concentrators by varying the electrical resistance of the circuit it is possible to increase the amplitude of generated pulsed magnetic fields without the threat of concentrator destruction by about 25~\%, from 32 to 40~T.

Title: Why Diffusion Models Don't Memorize: The Role of Implicit Dynamical Regularization in Training
Authors: Tony Bonnaire, Raphaël Urfin, Giulio Biroli, Marc Mézard
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of generative tasks. A key challenge is understanding the mechanisms that prevent their memorization of training data and allow generalization. In this work, we investigate the role of the training dynamics in the transition from generalization to memorization. Through extensive experiments and theoretical analysis, we identify two distinct timescales: an early time $\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ at which models begin to generate high-quality samples, and a later time $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ beyond which memorization emerges. Crucially, we find that $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ increases linearly with the training set size $n$, while $\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ remains constant. This creates a growing window of training times with $n$ where models generalize effectively, despite showing strong memorization if training continues beyond it. It is only when $n$ becomes larger than a model-dependent threshold that overfitting disappears at infinite training times. These findings reveal a form of implicit dynamical regularization in the training dynamics, which allow to avoid memorization even in highly overparameterized settings. Our results are supported by numerical experiments with standard U-Net architectures on realistic and synthetic datasets, and by a theoretical analysis using a tractable random features model studied in the high-dimensional limit.

Title: Boosting quantum efficiency by reducing complexity
Authors: Giovanni Sisorio, Alberto Cappellaro, Luca Dell'Anna
Abstract: In the context of energy storage at the nanoscale, exploring the notion of \textit{quantum advantage} implies walking on the thin line at the boundary between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, which underpins our conventional understanding of battery devices. With no classical analogue, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model has emerged in the last years as a promising platform to boost charging and storage efficiency thanks to its highly-entangling dynamics. Here, we explore how the robustness of this setup by considering the sparse version of the SYK model, showing that, as long as chaos is not completely broken, reducing its complexity may lead to more efficient quantum batteries.

Title: Farm Size Matters: A Spatially Explicit Ecological-Economic Framework for Biodiversity and Pest Control
Authors: Elia Moretti, Michel Loreau, Michael Benzaquen
Abstract: The intensification of European agriculture, characterized by increasing farm sizes, landscape simplification and reliance on synthetic pesticides, remains a key driver of biodiversity decline. While many studies have investigated this phenomenon, they often focus on isolated elements, resulting in a lack of holistic understanding and leaving policymakers and farmers with unclear priorities. This study addresses this gap by developing a spatially explicit ecological economic model designed to dissect the complex interplay between landscape structure and pesticide application, and their combined effects on natural enemy populations and farmers' economic returns. In particular, the model investigates how these relationships are modulated by farm size (a crucial aspect frequently overlooked in prior research). By calibrating on the European agricultural sector, we explore the ecological and economic consequences of various policy scenarios. We show that the effectiveness of ecological restoration strategies is strongly contingent upon farm size. Small to medium-sized farms can experience economic benefits from reduced pesticide use when coupled with hedgerow restoration, owing to enhanced natural pest control. In contrast, large farms encounter challenges in achieving comparable economic gains due to inherent landscape characteristics. This highlights the need to account for farm size in agri-environmental policies in order to promote biodiversity conservation and agricultural sustainability.

Title: Multiplexity amplifies geometry in networks
Authors: Jasper van der Kolk, Dmitri Krioukov, Marián Boguñá, M. Ángeles Serrano
Abstract: Many real-world network are multilayer, with nontrivial correlations across layers. Here we show that these correlations amplify geometry in networks. We focus on mutual clustering--a measure of the amount of triangles that are present in all layers among the same triplets of nodes--and find that this clustering is abnormally high in many real-world networks, even when clustering in each individual layer is weak. We explain this unexpected phenomenon using a simple multiplex network model with latent geometry: links that are most congruent with this geometry are the ones that persist across layers, amplifying the cross-layer triangle overlap. This result reveals a different dimension in which multilayer networks are radically distinct from their constituent layers.

Title: A Magnetic-like description of Oscillatory Behavior in Chemotactic Ants
Authors: Rosa Flaquer-Galmés, Daniel Campos, Javier Cristín
Abstract: We investigate the role of chemotaxis in the movement dynamics of Aphaenogaster Senilis ants. To do so, we design an experimental setup in which individual ants are exposed to a narrow pheromone trail to guide their motion. As expected, ants locate and navigate the trail by detecting chemical scents, exhibiting a characteristic zigzag pattern, moving at a nearly constant speed while oscillating perpendicularly to the trail. The zigzagging motion is common across many species yet its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we propose a physical framework based on the Inertial Spin Model as an approach to quantitatively describe and explain this behavior. So, we implement chemotaxis resembling magnetic-like interactions between the ant's velocity and the pheromone gradient. Under specific approximations, the model yields an analytical expression for the velocity correlations perpendicular to the trail, predicting a characteristic oscillatory decay. This prediction closely matches our experimental data, suggesting that the model captures the essential ingredients of ant dynamics. By fitting the model parameters to individual experimental trajectories, we further explore their potential biological significance and validate our assumptions. Overall, our findings contribute to the understanding of chemotaxis in ant motion and its physical features.

Title: Guided polariton condensate in perovskite microwires
Authors: Maciej Nytko, Mateusz Kędziora, Maciej Zaremba, Marek Ekielski, Anna Szerling, Krzysztof Tyszka, Barbara Piętka
Abstract: Perovskite microwires are promising candidates for integrated photonic systems due to their strong nonlinear optical response and inherent waveguiding capabilities. In this study, we focus on the directional emission properties of exciton-polariton condensates formed within perovskite microwires, with emphasis on emission collected from the microwire end. We constructed a multi-angle optical detection setup that allows us to identify the exciton-polariton condensation threshold and track the evolution of the condensate for different excitation position along and across the microwire. We observe spectrally narrow exciton-polariton condensate emission from the microwire end even when the condensate is generated tens of micrometers away, which demonstrates the ability of the exciton-polariton condensate to propagate over long distances within the microwire. Furthermore, we find that the presence of structural defects near the condensate location can significantly enhance the emission from the microwire end due to aligning the condensate's momentum with the waveguide direction, thereby facilitating more efficient propagation.

Title: The Nuclear Route: Sharp Asymptotics of ERM in Overparameterized Quadratic Networks
Authors: Vittorio Erba, Emanuele Troiani, Lenka Zdeborová, Florent Krzakala
Abstract: We study the high-dimensional asymptotics of empirical risk minimization (ERM) in over-parametrized two-layer neural networks with quadratic activations trained on synthetic data. We derive sharp asymptotics for both training and test errors by mapping the $\ell_2$-regularized learning problem to a convex matrix sensing task with nuclear norm penalization. This reveals that capacity control in such networks emerges from a low-rank structure in the learned feature maps. Our results characterize the global minima of the loss and yield precise generalization thresholds, showing how the width of the target function governs learnability. This analysis bridges and extends ideas from spin-glass methods, matrix factorization, and convex optimization and emphasizes the deep link between low-rank matrix sensing and learning in quadratic neural networks.

Title: A variational quantum eigensolver tailored to multi-band tight-binding simulations of electronic structures
Authors: Dongkeun Lee, Hoon Ryu
Abstract: We propose a cost-efficient measurement scheme of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for atomistic simulations of electronic structures based on a tight-binding (TB) theory. Leveraging the lattice geometry of a material domain, the sparse TB Hamiltonian is constructed in a bottom-up manner and is represented as a linear combination of the standard-basis (SB) operators. The cost function is evaluated with an extended version of the Bell measurement circuit that can simultaneously measure multiple SB operators and therefore reduces the number of circuits required bythe evaluation process. The proposed VQE scheme is applied to find band-gap energies of metal-halide-perovskite supercells that have finite dimensions with closed boundaries and are described with a sp3 TB model. Experimental results confirm that the proposed scheme gives solutions that follow well the accurate ones, but, more importantly, has the computing efficiency that is obviously superior to the commutativity-based Pauli grouping methods. Extending the application scope of VQE to three-dimensional confined atomic structures, this work can serve as a practical guideline for handling TB simulations in the noise-intermediate-scale quantum devices.

Title: Learning with Restricted Boltzmann Machines: Asymptotics of AMP and GD in High Dimensions
Authors: Yizhou Xu, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborová
Abstract: The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is one of the simplest generative neural networks capable of learning input distributions. Despite its simplicity, the analysis of its performance in learning from the training data is only well understood in cases that essentially reduce to singular value decomposition of the data. Here, we consider the limit of a large dimension of the input space and a constant number of hidden units. In this limit, we simplify the standard RBM training objective into a form that is equivalent to the multi-index model with non-separable regularization. This opens a path to analyze training of the RBM using methods that are established for multi-index models, such as Approximate Message Passing (AMP) and its state evolution, and the analysis of Gradient Descent (GD) via the dynamical mean-field theory. We then give rigorous asymptotics of the training dynamics of RBM on data generated by the spiked covariance model as a prototype of a structure suitable for unsupervised learning. We show in particular that RBM reaches the optimal computational weak recovery threshold, aligning with the BBP transition, in the spiked covariance model.

Title: F-ANcGAN: An Attention-Enhanced Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Architecture for Synthetic Image Generation of Nanoparticles
Authors: Varun Ajith, Anindya Pal, Saumik Bhattacharya, Sayantari Ghosh
Abstract: Nanomaterial research is becoming a vital area for energy, medicine, and materials science, and accurate analysis of the nanoparticle topology is essential to determine their properties. Unfortunately, the lack of high-quality annotated datasets drastically hinders the creation of strong segmentation models for nanoscale imaging. To alleviate this problem, we introduce F-ANcGAN, an attention-enhanced cycle consistent generative adversarial system that can be trained using a limited number of data samples and generates realistic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images directly from segmentation maps. Our model uses a Style U-Net generator and a U-Net segmentation network equipped with self-attention to capture structural relationships and applies augmentation methods to increase the variety of the dataset. The architecture reached a raw FID score of 17.65 for TiO$_2$ dataset generation, with a further reduction in FID score to nearly 10.39 by using efficient post-processing techniques. By facilitating scalable high-fidelity synthetic dataset generation, our approach can improve the effectiveness of downstream segmentation task training, overcoming severe data shortage issues in nanoparticle analysis, thus extending its applications to resource-limited fields.

Title: Statistical Localization in a Rydberg Simulator of $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: Prithvi Raj Datla, Luheng Zhao, Wen Wei Ho, Natalie Klco, Huanqian Loh
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a framework for describing dynamical systems ranging from nuclei to materials. LGTs that host concatenated conservation laws can exhibit Hilbert space fragmentation, where each subspace may be labeled by a conserved quantity with nonlocal operator support. It is expected that nonlocal conservation laws will not impede thermalization locally. However, this expectation has recently been challenged by the notion of statistical localization, wherein particular motifs of microscopic configurations may remain frozen in time due to strong Hilbert space fragmentation. Here, we report the first experimental signatures of statistically-localized behavior. We realize a novel constrained LGT model using a facilitated Rydberg atom array, where atoms mediate the dynamics of electric charge clusters whose nonlocal pattern of net charges remains invariant. By experimentally reconstructing observables sampled from a temporal ensemble, we probe the spatial distribution of each conserved quantity. We find that as a result of strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the expectation values of all conserved quantities remain locally distributed in typical quantum states, even though they are described by nonlocal string-like operators. Our work opens the door to high-energy explorations of cluster dynamics and low-energy studies of strong zero modes that persist in infinite-temperature topological systems.

Title: Nonadiabatic reactive scattering of hydrogen on different surface facets of copper
Authors: Wojciech G. Stark, Connor L. Box, Matthias Sachs, Nils Hertl, Reinhard J. Maurer
Abstract: Dissociative chemisorption is a key process in hydrogen-metal surface chemistry, where nonadiabatic effects due to low-lying electron-hole-pair excitations may affect reaction outcomes. Molecular dynamics with electronic friction simulations can capture weak nonadiabatic effects at metal surfaces, but require as input energy landscapes and electronic friction tensors. Here, we present full-dimensional machine learning surrogate models of the electronic friction tensor to study reactive hydrogen chemistry at the low-index surface facets Cu(100), Cu(110), Cu(111), and Cu(211). We combine these surrogate models with machine learning interatomic potentials to simulate quantum-state-resolved H$_2$ reactive scattering on pristine copper surfaces. The predicted sticking coefficient and survival probabilities are in excellent agreement with experiment. Comparison between adiabatic and nonadiabatic simulations reveals that the influence of electron-hole pair excitations on the scattering dynamics is weak and that the probability for dissociative adsorption is dominated by the shape of the underlying potential energy surface and the initial vibrational quantum state. Nonadiabatic effects only lead to subtle changes in rovibrationally inelastic state-to-state scattering probabilities. The differences between jellium-based isotropic local density friction and full ab-initio response-theory-based orbital-dependent friction are even more subtle. The presented machine learning models represent the most accurate publicly available, full-dimensional models for H$_2$ on copper to date.

Title: Macroscopic Stochastic Thermodynamics
Authors: Gianmaria Falasco, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: Starting at the mesoscopic level with a general formulation of stochastic thermodynamics in terms of Markov jump processes, we identify the scaling conditions that ensure the emergence of a (typically nonlinear) deterministic dynamics and an extensive thermodynamics at the macroscopic level. We then use large deviations theory to build a macroscopic fluctuation theory around this deterministic behavior, which we show preserves the fluctuation theorem. For many systems (e.g. chemical reaction networks, electronic circuits, Potts models), this theory does not coincide with Langevin-equation approaches (obtained by adding Gaussian white noise to the deterministic dynamics) which, if used, are thermodynamically inconsistent. Einstein-Onsager theory of Gaussian fluctuations and irreversible thermodynamics are recovered at equilibrium and close to it, respectively. Far from equilibirum, the free energy is replaced by the dynamically generated quasi-potential (or self-information) which is a Lyapunov function for the macroscopic dynamics. Remarkably, thermodynamics connects the dissipation along deterministic and escape trajectories to the Freidlin-Wentzell quasi-potential, thus constraining the transition rates between attractors induced by rare fluctuations. A coherent perspective on minimum and maximum entropy production principles is also provided. For systems that admit a continuous-space limit, we derive a nonequilibrium fluctuating field theory with its associated thermodynamics. Finally, we coarse grain the macroscopic stochastic dynamics into a Markov jump process describing transitions among deterministic attractors and formulate the stochastic thermodynamics emerging from it.

Title: Active Healing of Microtubule-Motor Networks
Authors: Fan Yang, Shichen Liu, Hao Wang, Heun Jin Lee, Rob Phillips, Matt Thomson
Abstract: Cytoskeletal networks have a self-healing property where networks can repair defects to maintain structural integrity. However, both the mechanisms and dynamics of healing remain largely unknown. Here we report a healing mechanism in microtubule-motor networks by active crosslinking. We directly generate defects using a light-controlled microtubule-motor system in O-shaped and V-shaped networks, and observe that the defects can self-heal. Combining theory and experiment, we find that the V-shaped networks must overcome internal elastic resistance in order to heal cracks, giving rise to a bifurcation of dynamics dependent on the initial opening angle of the crack: the crack merges below a critical angle and opens up at larger angles. Simulation of a continuum model reproduces the bifurcation dynamics, revealing the importance of a boundary layer where free motors and microtubules can actively crosslink and thereby heal the defects. We also formulate a simple elastic-rod model that can qualitatively predict the critical angle, which is found to be tunable by the network geometry.

Title: Pseudomode expansion of many-body correlation functions
Authors: Alexander Teretenkov, Filipp Uskov, Oleg Lychkovskiy
Abstract: We present an expansion of a many-body correlation function in a sum of pseudomodes -- exponents with complex frequencies that encompass both decay and oscillations. The pseudomode expansion emerges in the framework of the Heisenberg version of the recursion method. This method essentially solves Heisenberg equations in a Lanczos tridiagonal basis constructed in the Krylov space of a given observable. To obtain pseudomodes, we first add artificial dissipation satisfying the dissipative generalization of the universal operator growth hypothesis, and then take the limit of the vanishing dissipation strength. Fast convergence of the pseudomode expansion is facilitated by the localization in the Krylov space, which is generic in the presence of dissipation and can survive the limit of the vanishing dissipation strength. As an illustration, we present pseudomode expansions of infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions in the quantum Ising and $XX$ spin-$1/2$ models on the square lattice. It turns out that it is enough to take a few first pseudomodes to obtain a good approximation to the correlation function.

Title: Characterization of higher-order topological superconductors using Bott indices
Authors: Xun-Jiang Luo, Jia-Zheng Li, Meng Xiao, Fengcheng Wu
Abstract: The abundance of bulk and boundary topologies in higher-order topological phases offer remarkable tunability and diversity to boundary states but also pose a challenge to their unified topological characterization. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to characterize time-reversal invariant topological superconductors hosting Majorana Kramers pairs (MKP) of corner states by using a series of spin Bott indices, which capture both bulk and boundary states topology. The developed invariants can characterize MKP in arbitrarily shaped systems and all distinct spatial distribution patterns of MKP. As an illustrative example, we apply our theory to analyze the Kane-Mele model with sublattice-dependent superconducting pairing potentials. In this representative model, both intrinsic and extrinsic higher-order topological superconductors can be realized and various patterns of MKP can be engineered through edge cleavage. Despite their high sensitivity to boundary terminations, MKP can be faithfully characterized by the proposed topological invariants. We further demonstrate the characterization of higher-order topological superconductors in the BDI symmetry class using Bott indices without resolving the spin degree of freedom.

Title: Gate-defined Kondo lattices with valley-helical quantum dot arrays
Authors: Antonio L. R. Manesco
Abstract: Kondo physics and heavy-fermion behavior have been predicted and observed in moiré materials. The electric tunability of moiré materials allows an in-situ study of Kondo lattices' phase diagrams, which is not possible with their intermetallic counterparts. However, moiré platforms rely on twisting, which introduces twisting angle disorder and undesired buckling. Here we propose device layouts for one- and two-dimensional gate-defined superlattices in Bernal bilayer graphene where localized states couple to dispersive valley-helical modes. 16We show that, under electronic interactions, these superlattices are described by an electrically-tunable Kondo-Heisenberg model.

Title: Data-driven stochastic 3D modeling of the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in battery cathodes
Authors: Phillip Gräfensteiner, Markus Osenberg, André Hilger, Nicole Bohn, Joachim R. Binder, Ingo Manke, Volker Schmidt, Matthias Neumann
Abstract: A stochastic 3D modeling approach for the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in hierarchically structured cathodes of lithium-ion batteries is presented. The binder-conductive additive phase of these electrodes consists of carbon black, polyvinylidene difluoride binder and graphite particles. For its stochastic 3D modeling, a three-step procedure based on methods from stochastic geometry is used. First, the graphite particles are described by a Boolean model with ellipsoidal grains. Second, the mixture of carbon black and binder is modeled by an excursion set of a Gaussian random field in the complement of the graphite particles. Third, large pore regions within the mixture of carbon black and binder are described by a Boolean model with spherical grains. The model parameters are calibrated to 3D image data of cathodes in lithium-ion batteries acquired by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy. Subsequently, model validation is performed by comparing model realizations with measured image data in terms of various morphological descriptors that are not used for model fitting. Finally, we use the stochastic 3D model for predictive simulations, where we generate virtual, yet realistic, image data of nanoporous binder-conductive additives with varying amounts of graphite particles. Based on these virtual nanostructures, we can investigate structure-property relationships. In particular, we quantitatively study the influence of graphite particles on effective transport properties in the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase, which have a crucial impact on electrochemical processes in the cathode and thus on the performance of battery cells.

Title: Acoustic signaling enables collective perception and control in active matter systems
Authors: Alexander Ziepke, Ivan Maryshev, Igor S. Aranson, Erwin Frey
Abstract: Emergent cooperative functionality in active matter systems plays a crucial role in various applications of active swarms, ranging from pollutant foraging and collective threat detection to tissue embolization. In nature, animals like bats and whales use acoustic signals to communicate and enhance their evolutionary competitiveness. Here, we show that information exchange by acoustic waves between active agents creates a large variety of multifunctional structures. In our realization of collective swarms, each unit is equipped with an acoustic emitter and a detector. The swarmers respond to the resulting acoustic field by adjusting their emission frequency and migrating toward the strongest signal. We find self-organized structures with different morphology, including snake-like self-propelled entities, localized aggregates, and spinning rings. These collective swarms exhibit emergent functionalities, such as phenotype robustness, collective decision-making, and environmental sensing. For instance, the collectives show self-regeneration after strong distortion, allowing them to penetrate through narrow constrictions. Additionally, they exhibit a population-scale perception of reflecting objects and a collective response to acoustic control inputs. Our results provide insights into fundamental organization mechanisms in information-exchanging swarms. They may inspire design principles for technical implementations in the form of acoustically or electromagnetically communicating microrobotic swarms capable of performing complex tasks and concerting collective responses to external cues.

Title: Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions in a topological superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor junction
Authors: Adrian Reich, Dmitriy S. Shapiro, Alexander Shnirman
Abstract: We investigate quantum phase transitions in a topological Josephson junction with an embedded ferromagnetic layer, revealing a rich landscape of critical phenomena. The low-energy excitations comprise Majorana fermions propagating along the junction, coupled to the magnons in the ferromagnet. Based on mean-field and renormalization group arguments, we predict Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions in this system, both in the case of a magnetic easy-plane and weak easy-axis anisotropy. In the latter case, this is based on an emergent effective easy-plane, spanned by the easy-axis and the component of the magnetization which couples to the Majoranas. We conclude by presenting a conjecture for the full phase diagram of the model. It covers BKT transitions as well as exotic multicritical and supersymmetric points known from related models of interacting real fermions and bosons.

Title: Light-induced inverse spin Hall effect and field-induced circular photogalvanic effect in GaAs revealed by two-dimensional terahertz Fourier analysis
Authors: Tomohiro Fujimoto, Yuta Murotani, Tomohiro Tamaya, Takayuki Kurihara, Natsuki Kanda, Changsu Kim, Jun Yoshinobu, Hidefumi Akiyama, Takeo Kato, Ryusuke Matsunaga
Abstract: The electromotive force transverse to a bias field under irradiation of circularly polarized light, namely the photovoltaic Hall response or light-induced anomalous Hall effect, has attracted considerable attention to investigate the topologically nontrivial states in Floquet engineering and the inverse spin Hall effect of spin-polarized carriers in spintronics. However, taking into account inversion symmetry breaking by the bias field, the circularly polarized light can excite photocarriers with asymmetric momentum distribution, which generates injection current transverse to the bias field. Therefore, the field-induced circular photogalvanic effect (FI-CPGE) should also emerge in the very same experimental configuration for light-induced anomalous Hall effect but has been overlooked in literature. In this work, using terahertz pulses as a bias field for a semiconductor GaAs, we conduct two-dimensional Fourier analysis and demonstrate that FI-CPGE can play a major role in the photovoltaic Hall response. Counterintuitively, FI-CPGE is significantly enhanced when the photocarriers are excited near the bandgap with small density of states and low group velocity, which can be explained by a three-level resonant nonlinear interaction near the band degeneracy point. We also clarified that FI-CPGE would be further largely detected in the contact-type measurement using electrodes because of the absence of a filtering effect inherent to terahertz pulses. This work provides a comprehensive, generalized view of the photovoltaic Hall response in biased materials, paving a new avenue for detecting topological monopoles in momentum space hidden in equilibrium using third-order nonlinear responses.

Title: Tuning the lasing threshold of quantum well exciton-polaritons under a magnetic field in Faraday geometry: a theoretical study
Authors: Le Tri Dat, Nguyen Dung Chinh, Vinh N.T. Pham, Vo Quoc Phong, Nguyen Duy Vy
Abstract: Polariton lasing is a promising phenomenon with potential applications in next-generation lasers that operate without the need for population inversion. Applying a perpendicular magnetic field to a quantum well (QW) significantly alters the properties of exciton-polaritons. In this theoretical study, we investigate how the lasing threshold of QW exciton-polaritons depends on the magnetic field. By modifying the exciton's effective mass and Rabi splitting, the magnetic field induces notable changes in the relaxation kinetics, which directly affect the lasing threshold. For low-energy pumping, an increase in the magnetic field delays the lasing threshold, while for high-energy pumping, the threshold is reached at much lower pump intensities. Furthermore, increasing both the pump energy and the magnetic field enhances relaxation efficiency, leading to a substantially larger number of condensed polaritons. Our result gives insights into the modulation of exciton-polariton condensation through magnetic fields, with potential implications for the design of low-threshold polariton lasers.

Title: Thermalization of a Closed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev System in the Thermodynamic Limit
Authors: Santiago Salazar Jaramillo, Rishabh Jha, Stefan Kehrein
Abstract: The question of thermalization of a closed quantum system is of central interest in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here we present one such study analyzing the dynamics of a closed coupled Majorana SYK system. We have a large-$q$ SYK model prepared initially at equilibrium quenched by introducing a random hopping term, thus leading to non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the final stationary state reaches thermal equilibrium with respect to the Green's functions and energy. Accordingly, the final state is characterized by calculating its final temperature and the thermalization rate. We provide a detailed review of analytical methods and derive the required Kadanoff-Baym equations, which are then solved using the algorithm developed in this work. Our results display rich thermalization dynamics in a closed quantum system in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Inverse-design topology optimization of magnonic devices using level-set method
Authors: Andrey A. Voronov, Marcos Cuervo Santos, Florian Bruckner, Dieter Suess, Andrii V. Chumak, Claas Abert
Abstract: The inverse design approach in magnonics exploits the wave nature of magnons and machine learning to develop logical devices with functionalities that exceed the capabilities of analytical methods. While promising for analog, Boolean, and neuromorphic computing, current implementations face memory limitations that hinder the design of complex systems. This study presents a level-set parameterization method for topology optimization, combined with an adjoint-state approach for memory-efficient simulation of magnetization dynamics. The framework is implemented in NeuralMag, a GPU-accelerated micromagnetic solver featuring a nodal finite-difference scheme and automatic differentiation tools. To validate the method, we optimized the shape of a magnetic nanoparticle by applying constraints to the objective function, and designed a 300-nm-wide yttrium iron garnet demultiplexer achieving frequency-selective spin-wave separation. These results highlight the algorithm's efficiency in exploring local minima across various initial configurations, establishing its utility as a versatile tool for the inverse design of magnonic logic devices.

Title: The Interplay Between Electron Localization, Magnetic Order, and Jahn-Teller Distortion that Dictates LiMnO$_2$ Phase Stability
Authors: Ronald L. Kam, Luca Binci, Aaron D. Kaplan, Kristin A. Persson, Nicola Marzari, Gerbrand Ceder
Abstract: The development of Mn-rich cathodes for Li-ion batteries promises to alleviate supply chain bottlenecks in battery manufacturing. Challenges in Mn-rich cathodes arise from Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions of Mn$^{3+}$, Mn migration, and phase transformations to spinel-like order, which can affect the electrochemical performance. These phenomena motivate an ab initio re-examination of the thermodynamics of the LiMnO2 polymorphs. It is found that the generalized gradient approximation (GGA - PBEsol) and meta-GGA (r2SCAN) density functionals with empirical on-site Hubbard U corrections yield spurious stable phases for LiMnO2, such as predicting a phase with gamma-LiFeO2-like order (g-LiMnO2) to be the ground state instead of the orthorhombic (Pmmn) phase, which is the experimentally known ground state. Accounting for the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in each structure has a substantial effect on the total energies and resulting phase stability. By using hybrid-GGA (HSE06) and GGA with self-consistent Hubbard parameters (on-site U and inter-site V), the experimentally observed LiMnO2 phase stability trends are recovered. The calculated Hubbard U in the experimentally observed orthorhombic, layered, and spinel phases are significantly smaller than U in g-LiMnO2 and disordered layered structures. The smaller values of U are correlated with a collinear ordering of JT distortions, in which all $e_g$ orbitals are oriented in the same direction. This cooperative JT effect leads to increased Mn-O covalency, which contributes to the greater electronic stability compared to the phases with noncollinear JT arrangements, and also generate greater vibrational entropy, which helps stabilize these phases at high temperature. These phases are shown to be strongly insulating with large calculated band gaps > 3 eV, computed using HSE06 and $G_0W_0$.

Title: Anomalous topological edge modes in a periodically-driven trimer lattice
Authors: Mohammad Ghuneim, Raditya Weda Bomantara
Abstract: Periodically driven systems have a longstanding reputation for establishing rich topological phenomena beyond their static counterpart. In this work, we propose and investigate a periodically driven extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with three sites per unit cell, obtained by replacing the Pauli matrices with their $3\times 3$ counterparts. The system is found to support a number of edge modes over a range of parameter windows, some of which have no static counterparts. Among these edge modes, of particular interest are those which are pinned at a specific quasienergy value. Such quasienergy-fixed edge modes arise due to the interplay between topology and chiral symmetry, which are typically not expected in a three-band static model due to the presence of a bulk band at the only chiral-symmetric energy value, i.e., zero. In our time-periodic setting, another chiral-symmetric quasienergy value exists at half the driving frequency, which is not occupied by a bulk band and could then host chiral-symmetry-protected edge modes ($\pi$ modes). Finally, we verify the robustness of all edge modes against spatial disorder and briefly discuss the prospect of realizing our system in experiments.

Title: Thermal Annealing and Radiation Effects on Structural and Electrical Properties of NbN/GaN Superconductor/Semiconductor Junctions
Authors: Stephen Margiotta, Binzhi Liu, Saleh Ahmed Khan, Gabriel Calderon Ortiz, Ahmed Ibreljic, Jinwoo Hwang, A F M Anhar Uddin Bhuiyan
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, niobium nitride (NbN) superconductors have emerged as integral components due to their unique structural properties, including a high superconducting transition temperature (Tc), exceptional electrical conductivity, and compatibility with advanced device architectures. This study investigates the impact of high-temperature annealing and high-dose gamma irradiation on the structural and superconducting properties of NbN films grown on GaN via reactive DC magnetron sputtering. The as-deposited cubic {\delta}-NbN (111) films exhibited a high-intensity XRD peak, high Tc of 12.82K, and an atomically flat surface. Annealing at 500 and 950 °C for varying durations revealed notable structural and surface changes. High-resolution STEM indicated improved local ordering, while AFM showed reduced surface roughness after annealing. XPS revealed a gradual increase in the Nb/N ratio with higher annealing temperatures and durations. High-resolution XRD and STEM analyses showed lattice constant modifications in {\delta}-NbN films, attributed to residual stress changes following annealing. Additionally, XRD phi-scans revealed sixfold symmetry in NbN films due to rotational domains relative to GaN. While Tc remained stable after annealing at 500 °C, increasing the annealing temperature to 950 °C degraded Tc to ~8K and reduced the residual resistivity ratio from 0.85 in as-deposited films to 0.29 after 30 minutes. The effects of gamma radiation (5 Mrad (Si)) were also studied, demonstrating minimal changes to crystallinity and superconducting performance, indicating excellent radiation resilience. These findings highlight the potential of NbN superconductors for integration into advanced quantum devices and their suitability for applications in radiation-intensive environments such as space, satellites, and nuclear power plants.

Title: Disclinations, dislocations, and emanant flux at Dirac criticality
Authors: Maissam Barkeshli, Christopher Fechisin, Zohar Komargodski, Siwei Zhong
Abstract: What happens when fermions hop on a lattice with crystalline defects? The answer depends on topological quantum numbers which specify the action of lattice rotations and translations in the low energy theory. One can understand the topological quantum numbers as a twist of continuum gauge fields in terms of crystalline gauge fields. We find that disclinations and dislocations -- defects of crystalline symmetries -- generally lead in the continuum to a certain ``emanant'' quantized magnetic flux. To demonstrate these facts, we study in detail tight-binding models whose low-energy descriptions are (2+1)D Dirac cones. Our map from lattice to continuum defects explains the crystalline topological response to disclinations and dislocations, and motivates the fermion crystalline equivalence principle used in the classification of crystalline topological phases. When the gap closes, the presence of emanant flux leads to pair creation from the vacuum with the particles and anti-particles swirling around the defect. We compute the associated currents and energy density using the tools of defect conformal field theory. There is a rich set of renormalization group fixed points, depending on how particles scatter from the defect. At half flux, there is a defect conformal manifold leading to a continuum of possible low-energy theories. We present extensive numerical evidence supporting the emanant magnetic flux at lattice defects and we test our map between lattice and continuum defects in detail. We also point out a no-go result, which implies that a single (2+1)D Dirac cone in symmetry class AII is incompatible with a commuting $C_M$ rotational symmetry with $(C_M)^M = +1$.

Title: The electrostatic charge on exuded liquid drops
Authors: Schuyler Arn, Pablo Illing, Joshua Mendez Harper, Justin C. Burton
Abstract: Fluid triboelectrification, also known as flow electrification, remains an under-explored yet ubiquitous phenomenon with potential applications from material science to planetary evolution. Building upon previous efforts to position water within the triboelectric series, we investigate the charge on individual, millimetric water drops falling through air. Our experiments measured the charge and mass of each drop using a Faraday cup mounted on a mass balance, and connected to an electrometer. For pure water in a glass syringe with a grounded metal tip, we find the charge per drop ($\Delta q/\Delta m$) was approximately -5 pC/g to -1 pC/g. This was independent of the release height of the drop, tip diameter and length, tip cleaning preparation, and whether the experiment was shielded with a Faraday cage. Biasing the tip to different voltages allowed for linear control of the drop charge, and the results were consistent with known electrochemical effects, namely the Volta potential expected between most metals and bulk water ($\approx$ -0.5 V). Introducing insulating plastic materials into the experiment (from the syringe body or tip) imparted large amounts of charge on the drops with systematic charge evolution. Together these results show that the flow electrification of water is more complex than previously reported, and is driven by material-dependent electrostatic processes.

Title: Fractional vorticity, Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield systems and complex structures for the (generalized) spinor Gross-Pitaevskii equations
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora, Pablo Pais
Abstract: The (generalized) Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for a complex scalar field in two spatial dimensions is analyzed. It is shown that there is an infinite family of self-interaction potentials which admit Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bounds together with the corresponding first-order BPS systems. For each member of this family, the solutions of the first-order BPS systems are automatically solutions of the corresponding second-order generalized GPE. The simplest topologically non-trivial solutions of these first-order BPS systems describe configurations with quantized fractional vorticity. The corresponding fraction is related to the degree of non-linearity. The case in which the self-interaction potential is of order six (namely $|\Psi |^{6}$, which is a relevant theory both in relativistic quantum field theories in $(2+1)$ dimensions in connection with the quantum Hall effect as well as in the theory of the supersolids) is analyzed in detail. Such formalism can also be extended to the case of quantum mixtures with multi-component GPEs. The relationship between these techniques and supersymmetry will be discussed. In particular, despite several common features, we will show that there are multi-component GPEs that are not supersymmetric (at least, not in the standard sense) and possess a BPS system of the above type.

Title: Direct derivation of anisotropic atomic displacement parameters from molecular dynamics simulations in extended solids with substitutional disorder using a neural network potential
Authors: Yoyo Hinuma
Abstract: Atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) are crystallographic information that describe the statistical distribution of atoms around an atom site. Anisotropic ADPs by atom were directly derived from classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a universal machine-learned potential. The (co)valences of atom positions were taken over recordings at different time steps in a single MD simulation. The procedure was demonstrated on extended solids, namely rocksalt structure MgO and three thermoelectric materials, Ag8SnSe6, Na2In2Sn4, and BaCu1.14In0.86P2. Unlike the very frequently used lattice dynamics approach, the MD approach can obtain ADPs in crystals with substitutional disorder and explicitly at finite temperature, but not under conditions where atoms migrate in the crystal. The calculated ADP becomes ->0 at temperature ->0 and the ADP is proportional to the temperature when the atom is in a harmonic potential and the sole contribution to the actual non-zero ADP is from the zero-point motion. The zero-point motion contribution can be estimated from the proportionality constant assuming this Einstein model. ADPs from MD simulations would act as a tool complementing experimental efforts to understand the crystal structure including the distribution of atoms around atom sites.

Title: Magnetization symmetry for the MnTe altermagnetic candidate
Authors: N.N. Orlova, V.D. Esin, A.V. Timonina, N.N. Kolesnikov, E.V. Deviatov
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the magnetization angle dependence $M(\alpha)$ for single crystals of MnTe altermagnetic candidate. In high magnetic fields, experimental $M(\alpha)$ curves mostly reflect standard antiferromagnetic spin-flop processes, which are allowed below the Néel vector reorientation field. In low magnetic fields and at low temperatures, spontaneous magnetization appears as a sharp $M(T)$ magnetization jump around 81~K. In this regime, $M(\alpha)$ dependence is quite unusual: the easy magnetization axis is $\pi/2$ rotated either by increasing the field above 1~kOe or the temperature above 81~K. The observed behavior cannot be expected for antiferromagnetics, e.g. it differs strongly from the well known weak ferromagnetism. Thus, it requires to take into account the formation of the altermagnetic ground state for MnTe altermagnetic candidate. Despite MnTe is expected to have g-wave order parameter, $M(\alpha)$ magnetization symmetry confirms the prevailing population of one from three easy axes, as it has been shown previously by temperature-dependent angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy.

Title: Resolving the sodiation process in hard carbon anodes with nanostructure specific X-ray imaging
Authors: Martina Olsson, Antoine Klein, Nataliia Mozhzhukhina, Shizhao Xiong, Christian Appel, Mads Carlsen, Leonard Nielsen, Linnea Rensmo, Marianne Liebi, Aleksandar Matic
Abstract: Hard carbons show significant promise as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. However, monitoring the sodiation process in the hard carbon electrode during cycling and understanding the sodiation mechanism remain challenging. This article reports on operando 2D scanning small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS) and ex situ 3D SAXS tomography of hard carbon electrodes during the sodiation process. Structural changes are monitored with spatial and temporal resolution during the electrochemical process and shows that sodiation through micropore filling is the more dominating mechanism in the later stages of sodiation, i.e. in the plateau region of the voltage profile, while intercalation occurs continuously. Spatial inhomogeneities are resolved over the electrode and reveal an increased level of inhomogeneity at higher degree of sodiation with regions of different degrees of micropore filling. Resolving the processes spatially enables us to correlate plating, starting from the interface between the electrode and the current collector, to a higher degree of micropore filling. The work demonstrates how SWAXS imaging can contribute to understanding the sodiation of hard carbon anodes, not only by spatially resolved analysis, but also as a method to decouple contributions from different components in a cell, enabling more accurate scattering analysis in in situ environments.

Title: Probing dielectric breakdown in Mott insulators through current oscillations
Authors: Joan Triadú-Galí, Artur Garcia-Saez, Bruno Juliá-Díaz, Axel Pérez-Obiol
Abstract: We investigate the dielectric breakdown of mesoscopic Mott insulators, a phenomenon where a strong electric field destabilizes the insulating state, resulting in a transition to a metallic phase. Using the Landau-Zener formalism, which models the excitation of a two-level system, we derive a theoretical expression for the threshold value of the field. To validate our predictions, we present an efficient protocol for estimating the charge gap and threshold field via non-equilibrium current oscillations, overcoming the computational limitations of exact diagonalization. Our simulations demonstrate the accuracy of our theoretical formula for systems with small gaps. Moreover, our findings are directly testable in ultracold atomic experiments with ring geometries and artificial gauge fields, as our method uses measurable quantities and relies on already available technologies. This work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical models and experimentally realizable protocols, providing tools to explore non-equilibrium mesoscopic phenomena in strongly correlated quantum systems.

Abstract: Intelligent soft matter stands at the intersection of materials science, physics, and cognitive science, promising to change how we design and interact with materials. This transformative field seeks to create materials that possess life-like capabilities, such as perception, learning, memory, and adaptive behavior. Unlike traditional materials, which typically perform static or predefined functions, intelligent soft matter dynamically interacts with its environment. It integrates multiple sensory inputs, retains experiences, and makes decisions to optimize its responses. Inspired by biological systems, these materials intend to leverage the inherent properties of soft matter: flexibility, self-evolving, and responsiveness to perform functions that mimic cognitive processes. By synthesizing current research trends and projecting their evolution, we present a forward-looking perspective on how intelligent soft matter could be constructed, with the aim of inspiring innovations in fields such as biomedical devices, adaptive robotics, and beyond. We highlight new pathways for integrating design of sensing, memory and action with internal low-power operations and discuss challenges for practical implementation of materials with "intelligent behavior". These approaches outline a path towards to more robust, versatile and scalable materials that can potentially act, compute, and "think" by their inherent intrinsic material behaviour beyond traditional smart technologies relying on external control.

Title: State Diagram of the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model and the Effects of Symmetry
Authors: Martin Kjøllesdal Johnsrud, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: Interactions between active particles may be non-reciprocal, breaking action-reaction symmetry and leading to novel physics not seen in equilibrium systems. In this work, we study the state diagram for the non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model with different types of symmetry -- discrete and continuous -- and examine the effects of non-reciprocity on phase separation. The models are analyzed by drawing the full linear stability diagrams, indicating the onset of phase separation, allowing us to demonstrate how non-reciprocity gives rise to out-of-equilibrium steady states with non-zero currents. These observations remain valid in a large part of parameter space, and with the addition of weak noise. By describing the effects of symmetry on conserved, non-reciprocal models, this work adds to our understanding of the rich behavior of such models.

Title: Power-law banded random matrix ensemble as a model for quantum many-body Hamiltonians
Authors: Wouter Buijsman, Masudul Haque, Ivan M. Khaymovich
Abstract: We explore interpretations of the power-law banded random matrix (PLBRM) ensemble as Hamiltonians of one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. We introduce and compare a number of labeling schemes for assigning random matrix basis indices to many-body basis vectors. We compare the physical properties of the resulting Hamiltonians, focusing on the half-system eigenstate bipartite entanglement entropy. We show and quantify how the different PLBRM phases (ergodic, weakly ergodic, localized), known from the single-particle interpretation, can be interpreted as entanglement transitions in the quantum many-body interpretation. For the weakly ergodic phase, where spectral edge and bulk eigenstates show distinct behavior, we perform a detailed scaling analysis to provide a quantitative picture of the boundaries between different types of entanglement scaling behaviors. In particular, we identify and characterize an intermediate set of eigenstates whose entanglement entropy have volume law scaling but non-vanishing deviation from the Page value expected for maximally ergodic states.

Title: High emissivity, thermally robust emitters for high power density thermophotovoltaics
Authors: Minok Park, Shomik Verma, Alina LaPotin, Dustin P. Nizamian, Ravi Prasher, Asegun Henry, Sean D. Lubner, Costas P. Grigoropoulos, Vassilia Zorba
Abstract: Thermal radiative energy transport is essential for high-temperature energy harvesting technologies, including thermophotovoltaics (TPVs) and grid-scale thermal energy storage. However, the inherently low emissivity of conventional high-temperature materials constrains radiative energy transfer, thereby limiting both system performance and technoeconomic viability. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast femtosecond laser-material interactions to transform diverse materials into near-blackbody surfaces with broadband spectral emissivity above 0.96. This enhancement arises from hierarchically engineered light-trapping microstructures enriched with nanoscale features, effectively decoupling surface optical properties from bulk thermomechanical properties. These laser blackened surfaces (LaBS) exhibit exceptional thermal stability, retaining high emissivity for over 100 hours at temperatures exceeding 1000°C, even in oxidizing environments. When applied as TPV thermal emitters, Ta LaBS double electrical power output from 2.19 to 4.10 W cm-2 at 2200°C while sustaining TPV conversion efficiencies above 30%. This versatile, largely material-independent technique offers a scalable and economically viable pathway to enhance emissivity for advanced thermal energy applications.

Title: Growth of Highly Conductive PtSe2 Films Controlled by Raman Metrics for High-Frequency Photodetectors and Optoelectronic Mixers at 1.55 μm

Abstract: Two-dimensional PtSe2 exhibits outstanding intrinsic properties such as high carrier mobility, tunable bandgap, broadband absorption and air stability, making it ideal for (opto)electronic applications. However, achieving films of high crystalline quality with controlled properties on low-cost and insulating substrates remains challenging. Here, highly crystalline semimetallic PtSe2 films are grown by molecular beam epitaxy on sapphire substrates. It is shown that a post-growth annealing remarkably improves the out-of-plane crystallinity and leads to record sheet conductances, up to 1.6 mS. In-depth structural analyses reveal the strong influence of the domain arrangement within the films on their sheet conductance. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the A1g Raman peak width, in addition to the commonly used Eg peak width, are both effective metrics for evaluating the quality of PtSe2: films with narrower Eg and A1g peaks exhibit higher in-plane and out-of-plane crystalline quality, as well as higher sheet conductance. Finally, coplanar waveguides integrating a semimetallic PtSe2 channel are fabricated on a 2-inch sapphire substrate to demonstrate optoelectronic devices operating at the 1.55 um telecom wavelength. This includes photodetectors with a record bandwidth of 60 GHz and the first PtSe2-based optoelectronic mixer with a 30 GHz bandwidth.

Title: Cat states carrying long-range correlations in the many-body localized phase
Authors: Nicolas Laflorencie, Jeanne Colbois, Fabien Alet
Abstract: Despite considerable efforts over the last decade, the high-energy phase diagram of the random-field Heisenberg chain still eludes our understanding, in particular the nature of the non-ergodic many-body localized (MBL) regime expected at strong disorder. In this work, we revisit this paradigmatic model by studying the statistics of rare atypical events of strongly correlated spin pairs traversing the entire system. They occur for unexpectedly strong disorder, i.e., in a regime where standard estimates fail to detect any instability. We then identify these very peculiar high-energy eigenstates, which exhibit system-wide ${\cal{O}}(1)$ correlations, as nearly degenerate pairs of resonant cat states of the form $|{\Phi}_{\pm}\rangle\sim {|{\alpha_1}\rangle}\pm {|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$, where ${|{\alpha_1}\rangle}$ and ${|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$ are spin basis states. We propose a simple and generic analytical description of this new class of eigenstates that exhibit system-spanning entanglement. This analytical ansatz guides us in our search for rare hidden cat states in exponentially large many-body spectra. This also enables a systematic numerical inspection of the microscopic anatomy of these unconventional pairs, which appear in a wide range of disorder strengths. In the light of recent studies and ongoing debates on the MBL problem, our results offer new perspectives and stimulating challenges to this very active field.

Title: Non-universal Impact of Cholesterol on Ionic Liquid-Membrane Interactions
Authors: J. Gupta, V. K. Sharma, P. Hitaishi, A. K. Jha, J. B. Mitra, H. Srinivasan, S. Kumar, A. Kumar, S. K. Ghosh, S. Mitra
Abstract: Understanding the role of cholesterol in ionic liquid (IL)-membrane interactions is essential for advancing biomedical applications of ILs, including the development of innovative antimicrobial agents. In this study, we explore the intricate and multifaceted role of cholesterol in modulating IL-membrane interactions, employing a comprehensive suite of biophysical techniques. We systematically examine how IL alkyl chain length and membrane physical state influence the impact of cholesterol on IL-lipid membrane interaction. The incorporation of ILs is shown to increase the area per lipid in both pristine dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and DPPC-cholesterol membranes. Cholesterol modulates the impact of ILs on lipid conformation, membrane viscoelasticity, and phase behavior. Small-angle neutron scattering and dynamic light scattering measurements reveal that cholesterol mitigates IL-induced structural perturbations in vesicles. Our isothermal titration calorimetry measurements reveal that the presence of cholesterol significantly weakens the binding of ILs to membranes. Intriguingly, despite this reduced binding affinity, cholesterol-containing membranes demonstrate enhanced permeabilization. This counterintuitive effect is attributed to cholesterol's ordering of lipid membranes, which increases susceptibility to stress and defects. Our results underscore the complex and non-universal interplay between lipid composition, IL alkyl chain length, and membrane phase state. These insights provide a deeper understanding of cholesterol's role in IL-membrane interactions, paving the way for the design of advanced applications of ILs in antimicrobial therapy and drug delivery.

Title: Generic (fractional) quantum anomalous Hall crystals from interaction-driven band folding
Authors: Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Bin-Bin Chen, Wang Yao, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: The experimental realizations of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states have been achieved recently, and there is a growing number of experiments in moiré systems showing the inequality between the filling of the Chern band and the quantized Hall conductance: $\nu\neq\sigma_\mathrm{H}$. Among many possible explanations, a popular one is that the topological states have coexisting charge density wave (CDW) orders, and such states are referred to as Hall crystals. However, apart from the experimental uncertainties, the generic mechanism of Hall crystals, especially those with fractional $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is still elusive at the microscopic level. In this work, we numerically study a topological flat-band model and find that, the Chern band can be folded by the interaction-driven CDW, and a mini Chern band appears above the CDW gap. Through further analysis, we find the energy dispersion and the fluctuation of quantum geometry of the miniband could be flattened by competing interactions. When further doping this miniband, a series of (F)QAH states are found to coexist with the CDW order at (fractional)integer fillings of the miniband and the Hall conductivities of the FQAH crystals (FQAHCs)- determined by the fillings of the miniband - are different from the fillings of the original Chern band. We also study the thermodynamics of an FQAHC state and find the separation of energy scales and a compressible CDW phase at intermediate temperatures. Our work paves the way for the systematic understanding of (fractional) Hall crystals.

Title: Metal-Insulator Transition described by Natural Orbital Functional Theory
Authors: Juan Felipe Huan Lew-Yee, Mario Piris
Abstract: The metal-insulator transition (MIT) is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics and a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. Hydrogen-based systems offer a simple yet powerful model for investigating the MIT, as their insulating behavior arises purely from electron-electron interactions. In this work, we study finite hydrogen clusters with cubic geometries using Natural Orbital Functional Theory (NOFT), a method capable of accurately describing correlated systems beyond mean-field approaches. We focus on two key signatures of the MIT: the fundamental energy gap and the harmonic average of the atomic one-particle reduced density matrix. Our results show that NOFT captures the transition from insulating to metallic behavior as the interatomic distance decreases. By extrapolating the energy gap to the thermodynamic limit, we estimate a critical distance rc ~ 1.2 Ang, in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo benchmarks. These findings demonstrate the reliability of NOFT for describing strong correlation effects in large-scale models.

Title: A Family of Aperiodic Tilings with Tunable Quantum Geometric Tensor
Authors: Hector Roche Carrasco, Justin Schirmann, Aurelien Mordret, Adolfo G. Grushin
Abstract: The strict geometric rules that define aperiodic tilings lead to the unique spectral and transport properties of quasicrystals, but also limit our ability to design them. In this work, we explore the first continuously tunable family of two-dimensional aperiodic tilings in which the underlying real-space geometry becomes a control knob of the wave-function's quantum geometric tensor. The real-space geometry can be used to tune into topological phases occupying an expanded phase space compared to crystals, or into a disorder-driven topological Anderson insulator. The quantum metric can also be tuned continuously, opening new routes towards tunable single- and many-body physics in aperiodic solid-state and synthetic systems.

Title: Very persistent random walkers reveal transitions in landscape topology
Authors: Jaron Kent-Dobias
Abstract: We study the typical behavior of random walkers on the microcanonical configuration space of mean-field disordered systems. Passive walks have an ergodicity-breaking transition at precisely the energy density associated with the dynamical glass transition, but persistent walks remain ergodic at lower energies. In models where the energy landscape is thoroughly understood, we show that, in the limit of infinite persistence time, the ergodicity-breaking transition coincides with a transition in the topology of microcanonical configuration space. We conjecture that this correspondence generalizes to other models, and use it to determine the topological transition energy in situations where the landscape properties are ambiguous.

Title: Quantum melting of generalized electron crystal in twisted bilayer MoSe2
Authors: Qi Jun Zong, Haolin Wang, Qi Zhang, Xinle Cheng, Yangchen He, Qiaoling Xu, Ammon Fischer, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Daniel A. Rhodes, Lede Xian, Dante M. Kennes, Angel Rubio, Geliang Yu, Lei Wang
Abstract: Electrons can form an ordered solid crystal phase ascribed to the interplay between Coulomb repulsion and kinetic energy. Tuning these energy scales can drive a phase transition from electron solid to liquid, i.e. melting of Wigner crystal. Generalized Wigner crystals (GWCs) pinned to moire superlattices have been reported by optical and scanning-probe-based methods. Using transport measurements to investigate GWCs is vital to a complete characterization, however, still poses a significant challenge due to difficulties in making reliable electrical contacts. Here, we report the electrical transport detection of GWCs at fractional fillings nu = 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 8/9, 10/9, and 4/3 in twisted bilayer MoSe2. We further observe that these GWCs undergo continuous quantum melting transitions to liquid phases by tuning doping density, magnetic and displacement fields, manifested by quantum critical scaling behaviors. Our findings establish twisted bilayer MoSe2 as a novel system to study strongly correlated states of matter and their quantum phase transitions.

Title: Erasure-cooling, control, and hyper-entanglement of motion in optical tweezers
Authors: Adam L. Shaw, Pascal Scholl, Ran Finkelstein, Richard Bing-Shiun Tsai, Joonhee Choi, Manuel Endres
Abstract: Coherently controlling the motion of single atoms in optical tweezers would enable new applications in quantum information science. To demonstrate this, we first prepare atoms in their motional ground state using a species-agnostic cooling mechanism that converts motional excitations into erasures -- errors with a known location. This cooling mechanism fundamentally outperforms idealized traditional sideband cooling, which we experimentally demonstrate. By coherently manipulating the resultant pure motional state, we perform mid-circuit readout and mid-circuit erasure detection via local shelving into motional superposition states. We finally entangle the motion of two atoms in separate tweezers and generate hyper-entanglement by preparing a simultaneous Bell state of motional and optical qubits, unlocking a large new class of quantum operations with neutral atoms.

Title: Material properties of biomolecular condensates emerge from nanoscale dynamics
Authors: Nicola Galvanetto, Miloš T. Ivanović, Simone A. Del Grosso, Aritra Chowdhury, Andrea Sottini, Daniel Nettels, Robert B. Best, Benjamin Schuler
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers and have important functions in the cell $-$ functions that are inherently connected to their physical properties. A remarkable aspect of such condensates is that their viscoelastic properties can vary by orders of magnitude, but it has remained unclear how these pronounced differences are rooted in the nanoscale dynamics at the molecular level. Here we investigate a series of condensates formed by complex coacervation that span about two orders of magnitude in molecular dynamics, diffusivity, and viscosity. We find that the nanoscale chain dynamics on the nano- to microsecond timescale can be accurately related to both translational diffusion and mesoscale condensate viscosity by analytical relations from polymer physics. Atomistic simulations reveal that the observed differences in friction $-$ a key quantity underlying these relations $-$ are caused by differences in inter-residue contact lifetimes, leading to the vastly different dynamics among the condensates. The rapid exchange of inter-residue contacts we observe may be a general mechanism for preventing dynamic arrest in compartments densely packed with polyelectrolytes, such as the cell nucleus.

Title: Thermalization Dynamics in Closed Quantum Many Body Systems: a Precision Large Scale Exact Diagonalization Study
Authors: Ivo A. Maceira, Andreas M. Läuchli
Abstract: Using a Krylov-subspace time evolution algorithm, we simulate the real-time dynamics of translation invariant non-integrable finite spin rings to quite long times with high accuracy. We systematically study the finite-size deviation between the resulting equilibrium state and the thermal state, and we highlight the importance of the energy variance on the deviations. We find that the deviations are well described by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and that the von Neumann entropy correction scaling is the square of the local operator scaling. We reveal also an area law contribution to the relaxed von Neumann entropy, which we connect to the mutual information between the considered subsystem and its immediate environment. We also find that local observables relax towards equilibrium exponentially with a relaxation time scale that grows linearly with system length and is somewhat independent of the local operator, but depends strongly on the energy of the initial state, with the fastest relaxation times found towards one end of the overall energy spectrum. To contrast this behaviour we also study domain wall initial states, which exhibit clear diffusive behaviour, with a Thouless time scaling quadratically with the systems size, leading to a rather precise estimate for the diffusion constant for states in the vicinity of the middle of the energy spectrum.

Title: Condensation and prescaling in spatial Polyakov loop correlations far from equilibrium
Authors: Daniel Spitz, Kirill Boguslavski, Thimo Preis
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of spatial Polyakov loop correlations, which provide gauge-invariant observables akin to effective particle numbers for gluon plasmas, are investigated within real-time $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ lattice gauge theory at weak couplings and large gluon occupations. The momentum zero mode of these correlations reveals the dynamic formation of a condensate, while at nonzero momenta, energy is transported toward the ultraviolet. We demonstrate that the non-zero momentum dynamics is well described by a direct cascade in terms of gauge-invariant Polyakov loop excitations, exhibiting self-similar prescaling indicative of a nonthermal attractor. This behavior can be analytically understood through perturbation theory for the Polyakov loop correlations and the established dynamics of gauge field correlations. We perform simulations for both $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge groups, providing further consistency checks on the $N_c$-dependence of perturbative expectations. No evidence of an inverse cascade toward lower momenta is found for momenta above the electric screening scale.

Title: Impact of dephased entangled states and varying measurement orientations on the reliability of cryptographic keys generated via the quantum protocol E91: A quantum simulation approach
Authors: Adrián F. Hernández-Borda, María P. Rojas-Sepúlveda, Hanz Y. Ramírez-Gómez
Abstract: One of the main requirements to achieve reliable quantum communications are on-demand sources of highly entangled photon pairs, and semiconductor quantum dots have emerged as prominent candidates to satisfy the necessary conditions of brightness and entanglement fidelity. However, in most cases the biexciton-exciton-vacuum cascade produces a pair of maximally polarization-entangled photons with a dephasing, due to a non-negligible exciton fine structure splitting in the emitting nanostructure. This work focuses on the performance of the E91 quantum key distribution protocol under the variation of two elements: first, the phase in the input state when the protocol is implemented using entangled photons generated via the radiative cascade, and second, the relative directions of the polarization analyzers. We use a quantum computational approach by means of the IBM's API Qiskit to simulate the optical implementation of the studied cryptographic protocol and thus to validate analytical expressions derived for the secret key rate and the Bell's parameter. Our results show that the performance of the quantum transmission is highly impacted by the product between the exciton lifetime and the quantum dot's fine structure splitting and that such an impact may be modulated through the orientation of the polarizers. Under some specific conditions, the studied E91 protocol is shown to turn into the BBM92 protocol, to which the results can be extended. These findings provide important insight for the scalable implementation of quantum key distribution protocols with realistic entanglement sources. Furthermore, this study constitutes an illustrative example of how quantum computation can be used as a tool for simulating physical processes whose experimental realization can be substituted by short algorithms run on quantum software.

Title: Viscoelasticity reduces the droplet size in mucosalivary film fragmentation during intense respiratory events
Authors: Mogeng Li, Youssef Saade, Stéphane Zaleski, Uddalok Sen, Pallav Kant, Detlef Lohse
Abstract: We examine the fundamental fluid dynamical mechanisms dictating the generation of bioaerosols in the human trachea during intense respiratory events such as coughing and sneezing, with an emphasis on the role played by the mucosalivary fluid viscoelasticity. An experimental investigation of the shear-induced fragmentation of a mucosalivary-mimetic fluid in a confined geometry reveals that viscoelastic liquids undergo atomization in a manner akin to Newtonian liquids -- via the formation of bag-like structures -- which ultimately rupture through the appearance of retracting holes on the bag surface. Droplets are produced via the unstable retraction of liquid rims bounding these holes. However, in comparison to Newtonian liquids, viscoelastic bags inflate to larger sizes -- implying thinner sheets and, consequently smaller droplets upon rupture. Numerical simulations support that the smaller droplets can be attributed to the thinner sheets, with a more uniform thickness, for viscoelastic bags prior to rupture. Hence, we highlight the role of the viscoelasticity in determining the thickness of the intermediate bag-like structures, which, in turn, govern the droplet size distribution of the expelled aerosol.

Title: Parameter Symmetry Potentially Unifies Deep Learning Theory
Authors: Liu Ziyin, Yizhou Xu, Tomaso Poggio, Isaac Chuang
Abstract: The dynamics of learning in modern large AI systems is hierarchical, often characterized by abrupt, qualitative shifts akin to phase transitions observed in physical systems. While these phenomena hold promise for uncovering the mechanisms behind neural networks and language models, existing theories remain fragmented, addressing specific cases. In this position paper, we advocate for the crucial role of the research direction of parameter symmetries in unifying these fragmented theories. This position is founded on a centralizing hypothesis for this direction: parameter symmetry breaking and restoration are the unifying mechanisms underlying the hierarchical learning behavior of AI models. We synthesize prior observations and theories to argue that this direction of research could lead to a unified understanding of three distinct hierarchies in neural networks: learning dynamics, model complexity, and representation formation. By connecting these hierarchies, our position paper elevates symmetry -- a cornerstone of theoretical physics -- to become a potential fundamental principle in modern AI.

Title: Survival of the fastest -- algorithm-guided evolution of light-powered underwater microrobots
Authors: Mikołaj Rogóż, Zofia Dziekan, Piotr Wasylczyk
Abstract: Depending on multiple parameters, soft robots can exhibit different modes of locomotion that are difficult to model numerically. As a result, improving their performance is complex, especially in small-scale systems characterized by low Reynolds numbers, when multiple aero- and hydrodynamical processes influence their movement. In this work, we optimize light-powered millimetre-scale underwater swimmer locomotion by applying experimental results - measured swimming speed - as the fitness function in two evolutionary algorithms: particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. As these soft, light-powered robots with different characteristics (phenotypes) can be fabricated quickly, they provide a great platform for optimisation experiments, using many competing robots to improve swimming speed over consecutive generations. Interestingly, just like in natural evolution, unexpected gene combinations led to surprisingly good results, including eight-fold increase in speed or the discovery of a self-oscillating underwater locomotion mode.

Title: Metrology of open quantum systems from emitted radiation
Authors: Siddhant Midha, Sarang Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: We explore the task of learning about the dynamics of a Markovian open quantum system by monitoring the information it radiates into its environment. For an open system with Hilbert space dimension $D$, the quantum state of the emitted radiation can be described as a temporally ordered matrix-product state (MPS). We provide simple analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the radiation state, which asymptotically scales linearly with the sensing time unless the open system has multiple steady states. We characterize the crossovers in QFI near dynamical phase transitions, emphasizing the role of temporal correlations in setting the asymptotic rate at which QFI increases. We discuss when optimal sensing is possible with instantaneously measured radiation.

Title: Where You Place the Norm Matters: From Prejudiced to Neutral Initializations
Authors: Emanuele Francazi, Francesco Pinto, Aurelien Lucchi, Marco Baity-Jesi
Abstract: Normalization layers, such as Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization, are central components in modern neural networks, widely adopted to improve training stability and generalization. While their practical effectiveness is well documented, a detailed theoretical understanding of how normalization affects model behavior, starting from initialization, remains an important open question. In this work, we investigate how both the presence and placement of normalization within hidden layers influence the statistical properties of network predictions before training begins. In particular, we study how these choices shape the distribution of class predictions at initialization, which can range from unbiased (Neutral) to highly concentrated (Prejudiced) toward a subset of classes. Our analysis shows that normalization placement induces systematic differences in the initial prediction behavior of neural networks, which in turn shape the dynamics of learning. By linking architectural choices to prediction statistics at initialization, our work provides a principled understanding of how normalization can influence early training behavior and offers guidance for more controlled and interpretable network design.
