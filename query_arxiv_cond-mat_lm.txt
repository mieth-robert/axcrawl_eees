Title: Local texture of three-stage CVD SiC fibre by precession electron diffraction (PED) and XRD
Authors: B. Huang, Y. Q. Yang, M. H. Li, Y. X. Chen, X. Luo, M. S. Fu, Y. Chen, Xierong Zeng
Abstract: SiC fibre with the transverse isotropic properties is very important to it reinforced metal matrix composites. In this paper, local texture of the CVD SiC fibre was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and precession electron diffraction (PED) on transmission electron microscopy(TEM). The result from XRD is in agreement with the result obtained from PED. And the result shown that at the first stage of deposition, the preferred direction of SiC grains is almost random and the distribution of grain size is scattered. At the second and third stages of deposition, there are two kinds of texture in SiC fibre, that is, (110),111. and (110),115.. Furthermore, the grain size at the second and third stages is about 200 nm and it is lower at the third stage than at the second stage because of the lower temperature at the third stage. The [110] preferred direction along axial direction for SiC fibre is beneficial to the axial tensile strength.

Title: Exploiting solute segregation and partitioning to the deformation-induced planar defects and nano-martensite in designing ultra-strong Co-Ni base alloys
Authors: Akshat Godha, Mayank Pratap Singh, Karthick Sundar, Shashwat Kumar Mishra, Praveen Kumar, Govind B, Surendra Kumar Makineni
Abstract: Single-phase, multi-elements (three or more) with high concentrations show exceptional tensile strength up to ~ 0.8-1.2 GPa. However, they possess a very low 0.2% yield strength (YS), i.e., they can be permanently deformed at very low-stress levels of 300 to 600 MPa. Here, we reveal by exploiting atomic-scale solute interactions with the deformation-induced structures to design ultra-strong single-phase alloys with YS > 2 GPa. This was achieved by controlled thermomechanical processing that introduces stacking-faults (SFs), nano-twins (NTs), and nano-martensite {\epsilon}-laths (NMLs) during cold deformation followed by facilitating solute segregation/partitioning to them by tempering at intermediate temperature. We demonstrate the phenomena in a low stacking faulty energy multi-component (face-centered-cubic, fcc structured) Co-33Ni-24Cr alloy (all in at.%) containing 5at.% Mo as a solute. It is also shown that the degree of strengthening after tempering scales up with the fraction of these structures (before tempering) in the alloy microstructure that can be tuned by the amount and temperature of cold deformation. Cold-rolling with 45% and 65% thickness reduction, followed by tempering at 600°C for 4 hours, led to an YS of 1.5 GPa and 2 GPa with elongation to fracture (%El) 14% and 7%, respectively. The YS is further enhanced to ~ 2.2 GPa without reduction in %El upon cryo-rolling followed by tempering. The alloy microstructure is stable at 600°C up to 100 hours and also retains an YS of ~ 1.5 GPa with %El of 18% during tensile test at 600°C. The derived high YS and high-temperature stability are critically a consequence of solute partitioning to the NMLs that we termed as Solute-Partitioned NMLs (SP-NMLs) in the microstructure.

Title: Modelling hydrogen storage in metal hydrides
Authors: Francesc Font, Attila Husar, Tim Myers, Maria Aguareles, Esther Barrabés
Abstract: We develop a one-dimensional mathematical model for the loading process of hydrogen in a metal hydride tank. The model describes the evolution of the density and pressure of the hydrogen gas, the temperature of the tank, the averaged velocity of the gas through the porous metal structure, and the transformed fraction of metal into a metal hydride. The non-dimensionalisation of the model indicates a possible reduction of the system of equations and also shows that the density and the transformed metal fraction may be decoupled from the temperature equation. The reduced model is solved numerically. Introducing a spatial dependence into the kinetic reaction constant allows to explain unexpected temperature gradients observed in experiments.

Title: Phases of Interacting Fibonacci Anyons on a Ladder at Half-Filling
Authors: Nico Kirchner, Roderich Moessner, Frank Pollmann, Adam Gammon-Smith
Abstract: Two-dimensional many-body quantum systems can exhibit topological order and support collective excitations with anyonic statistics different from the usual fermionic or bosonic ones. With the emergence of these exotic point-like particles, it is natural to ask what phases can arise in interacting many-anyon systems. To study this topic, we consider the particular case of Fibonacci anyons subject to an anyonic tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor repulsion on a two-leg ladder. Focusing on the case of half-filling, for low interaction strengths an ''anyonic'' metal is found, whereas for strong repulsion, the anyons form an insulating charge-density wave. Within the latter regime, we introduce an effective one-dimensional model up to sixth order in perturbation theory arising from anyonic superexchange processes. We numerically identify four distinct phases of the effective model, which we characterize using matrix product state methods. These include both the ferro- and antiferromagnetic golden chain, a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase, and an incommensurate phase.

Title: Probing Tensor Monopoles and Gerbe Invariants in Three-Dimensional Topological Matter
Authors: Wojciech J. Jankowski, Robert-Jan Slager, Giandomenico Palumbo
Abstract: We show that momentum-space tensor monopoles corresponding to nontrivial vector bundle generalizations, known as bundle gerbes, can be realized in bands of three-dimensional topological matter with nontrivial Hopf invariants. We provide a universal construction of tensor Berry connections in these topological phases, demonstrating how obstructions therein lead to $\mathbb{Z}$-quantized bulk magnetoelectric and nonlinear optical phenomena. We then pinpoint that these quantum effects are supported by intraband and interband torsion leading to nontrivial Dixmier-Douady classes in most known Hopf phases and in more general topological insulators realizing gerbe invariants falling beyond the tenfold classification of topological phases of matter. We furthermore provide an interacting generalization upon introducing many-body gerbe invariants by employing twisted boundary conditions. This opens an avenue to study gerbe invariants realized through higher-dimensional charge fractionalizations that can be electromagnetically probed.

Title: What is the topological dual of the XXZ spin Chain?
Authors: Yicheng Tang, Pradip Kattel, Natan Andrei
Abstract: We construct a dual symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Hamiltonian for the $U(1)$ symmetric anisotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain-a model that has traditionally been used to study spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases, with an intervening extended Luttinger liquid phase. By performing a non-local unitary transformation, we explicitly construct a local fermionic Hamiltonian that exhibits two nontrivial topological phases separated by an extended Luttinger liquid regime. We demonstrate the topological nature of these phases by analyzing the entanglement structure, deriving a non-local string order parameter, and constructing an exact zero mode operator that connects states in different fermionic parity sectors.

Title: Chiral Wigner crystal phases induced by Berry curvature
Authors: Sandeep Joy, Leonid Levitov, Brian Skinner
Abstract: We consider the impact of Berry phase on the Wigner crystal (WC) state of a two-dimensional electron system. We consider first a model of Bernal bilayer graphene with a perpendicular displacement field, and we show that Berry curvature leads to a new kind of WC state in which the electrons acquire a spontaneous orbital angular momentum when the displacement field exceeds a critical value. We determine the phase boundary of the WC state in terms of electron density and displacement field at low temperature. We then derive the general effective Hamiltonian that governs the ordering of the physical electron spin. We show that this Hamiltonian includes a chiral term that can drive the system into chiral spin-density wave or spin liquid phases. The phenomena we discuss are relevant for the valley-polarized Wigner crystal phases observed in multilayer graphene.

Title: How transparent is graphene? A surface science perspective on remote epitaxy
Authors: Zach LaDuca, Anshu Sirohi, Quinn Campbell, Jason K Kawasaki
Abstract: Remote epitaxy is the synthesis of a single crystalline film on a graphene-covered substrate, where the film adopts epitaxial registry to the substrate as if the graphene is transparent. Despite many exciting applications for flexible electronics, strain engineering, and heterogeneous integration, an understanding of the fundamental synthesis mechanisms remains elusive. Here we offer a perspective on the synthesis mechanisms, focusing on the foundational assumption of graphene transparency. We highlight challenges for quantifying the strength of the remote substrate potential that permeates through graphene, and propose Fourier and beating analysis as a bias-free method for decomposing the lattice potential contributions from the substrate, from graphene, and from surface reconstructions, each at different frequencies. We highlight the importance of graphene-induced reconstructions on epitaxial templating, drawing comparison to moiré epitaxy. Finally, we highlight the role of the remote potential in tuning surface diffusion and adatom kinetics on graphene. Tuning the surface diffusion length is crucial in navigating the competition between remote epitaxy and defect-seeded mechanisms like pinhole epitaxy.

Title: Continuous transition from Fermi liquid to A fractional Chern insulator
Authors: Ya-Hui Zhang
Abstract: Recent experiments in moiré materials have observed fractional Chern insulators (FCI) at zero magnetic field, providing an opportunity to study the transition from FCI to the more conventional phases such as Fermi liquid (FL) and superconductor (SC) by tuning the interaction strength or bandwidth. In this work, we formulate a critical theory for a continuous transition at the filling $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$ between the FL and a FCI* phase that hosts an additional neutral sector, but has the same transport signatures as the usual FCI. In our framework, this corresponds to a transition from a composite Fermi liquid (CFL) to a superfluid* phase of the composite bosons. The Fermi liquid close to the transition has an additional factor $|z_i-z_j|^6$ in its wavefunction. Also, the transport behavior at high temperature on the FL side is actually like an `anyon gas' phase on top of the FCI, with $\rho_{xy}$ close to $\frac{3}{2}\frac{h}{e^2}$. FL behavior with $\rho_{xy} \approx 0$ is recovered only at very low temperature. We also briefly discuss the possibility of a chiral superconductor as the descendant of this strongly correlated FL and the potential relevance to the twisted MoTe$_2$ system.

Title: calcQPI: A versatile tool to simulate quasiparticle interference
Authors: Peter Wahl, Luke C. Rhodes, Carolina A. Marques
Abstract: Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) provides a route to characterize electronic structure from real space images acquired using scanning tunneling microscopy. It emerges due to scattering of electrons at defects in the material. The QPI patterns encode details of the $k$-space electronic structure and its spin and orbital texture. Recovering this information from a measurement of QPI is non-trivial, requiring modelling not only of the dominant scattering vectors, but also the overlap of the wave functions with the tip of the microscope. While, in principle, it is possible to model QPI from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for many quantum materials it is more desirable to model the QPI from a tight-binding model, where inaccuracies of the DFT calculation can be corrected. Here, we introduce an efficient code to simulate quasiparticle interference from tight-binding models using the continuum Green's function method.

Title: Persistent spin currents in superconducting altermagnets
Authors: Kyle Monkman, Joan Weng, Niclas Heinsdorf, Alberto Nocera, Marcel Franz
Abstract: Superconductors are famously capable of supporting persistent electrical currents, that is, currents that flow without any measurable decay as long as the material is kept in the superconducting state. We introduce here a class of materials -- superconducting altermagnets -- that can both generate and carry persistent {\em spin} currents. This includes spin-polarized electrical supercurrent as well as pure spin supercurrent that facilitates spin transport in the absence of any charge transport. A key to this remarkable property is the realization that the leading superconducting instability of altermagnetic metals consists of two independent condensates formed of spin-up and spin-down electrons. In the non-relativistic limit the two condensates are decoupled and can thus naturally support persistent currents with any spin polarization, including pure spin supercurrents realized in the charge counterflow regime. We describe a novel ``spin-current dynamo effect'' that can be used to generate pure spin supercurrent in such systems by driving a charge current along certain crystallographic directions. Away from the non-relativistic limit, when spin-orbit interactions and magnetic disorder are present, we find that the spin current generically develops spatial oscillations but, importantly, no dissipation or decay. This is in stark contrast to spin currents in normal diffusive metals which tend to decay on relatively short lengthscales. We illustrate the above properties by performing model calculations relevant to two distinct classes of altermagnets and various device geometries.

Title: Rheological modeling with GENERIC and with the Onsager principle
Authors: Miroslav Grmela
Abstract: In this paper we compare three frameworks for modeling flows of complex fluids: (i) local conservations of mass, momentum and energy, (ii) GENERIC, and (iii) Onsager principle. The first is based on the mass, momentum, and energy conservation implied by mechanics, the second on the observed approach of externally unforced fluids to equilibrium states at which their behavior is well described by equilibrium thermodynamics, and the third on the minimal resistance to external influences. The comparison is illustrated on isothermal and incompressible polymeric fluids.

Title: Emergent interactions lead to collective frustration in robotic matter
Authors: Onurcan Bektas, Adolfo Alsina, Steffen Rulands
Abstract: Current artificial intelligence systems show near-human-level capabilities when deployed in isolation. Systems of a few collaborating intelligent agents are being engineered to perform tasks collectively. This raises the question of whether robotic matter, where many learning and intelligent agents interact, shows emergence of collective behaviour. And if so, which kind of phenomena would such systems exhibit? Here, we study a paradigmatic model for robotic matter: a stochastic many-particle system in which each particle is endowed with a deep neural network that predicts its transitions based on the particles' environments. For a one-dimensional model, we show that robotic matter exhibits complex emergent phenomena, including transitions between long-lived learning regimes, the emergence of particle species, and frustration. We also find a density-dependent phase transition with signatures of criticality. Using active matter theory, we show that this phase transition is a consequence of self-organisation mediated by emergent inter-particle interactions. Our simple model captures key features of more complex forms of robotic systems.

Title: Spatially-periodic states in a strongly dipolar $^{164}$Dy-$^{162}$Dy mixture
Authors: S. K. Adhikari
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of a novel eigenstate in a strongly dipolar binary $^{164}$Dy-$^{162}$Dy mixture, where the inter- and intraspecies dipolar lengths are larger than the corresponding scattering lengths. When this mixture is confined by a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap, the total density exhibits the formation of droplets on a spatially-symmetric triangular or square lattice, where each droplet is formed of a single species of atoms; two types of atoms never exist on the same lattice site. The density of any of the species shows a partially-filled incomplete lattice, only the total density exhibits a completely full lattice structure. In this theoretical investigation we employ the numerical solution of an improved mean-field model including a Lee-Huang-Yang-type interaction in the intraspecies components alone, meant to stop a collapse of the atoms at high atom density.

Title: Large magnon dichroism and other optical properties of hexagonal ferrite h-Lu0.6Sc0.4FeO3 with altermagnetic A2 spin ordering

Abstract: Multiferroic hexagonal h-Lu0.6Sc0.4FeO3 single crystals with non-collinear spins were studied using the THz and Raman scattering spectroscopies and ellipsometry. Antiferromagnetic resonances, or magnons, were found at about 0.85 THz and 1.2 THz. These magnons harden as temperature increases and disappear above 130 K. This behavior is consistent with the magnetic susceptibility and a phase transition to a previously reported weak ferromagnetic state. A strong dichroism at the resonance with the AFM doublet has been observed at zero external magnetic field using both conventional circular polarization and THz vector vortex beams. This observation is attributed to the strong altermagnetic properties of h-Lu0.6Sc0.4FeO3 with a broken PT symmetry. The splitting of the magnon doublet in an external magnetic field applied long the c axis yields a g-factor of 3.0 for the Fe3+ ions. Raman spectra of the optical phonons revealed a Fano-type asymmetry due to their interaction with a continuum of polar excitations. Electronic transitions were studied with ellipsometry and the results were compared with the modelled using DFT+eDMFT.

Title: Self-propulsion symmetries determine entropy production of active particles with hidden states
Authors: Jacob Knight, Farid Kaveh, Gunnar Pruessner
Abstract: Entropy production distinguishes equilibrium from non-equilibrium. Calculating the entropy production rate (EPR) is challenging in systems where some degrees of freedom cannot be observed. Here we introduce a perturbative framework to calculate the ``partial EPR'' of a canonical hidden-state system, a generic self-propelled active particle with hidden self-propulsion. We find that the parity symmetry, P, and (time-)reversibility, T, of the hidden variable determine partial entropy production. Non-trivial entropy production appears at least at sixth order in the self-propulsion velocity. We apply our framework to two processes which break P- and T-symmetries respectively: an asymmetric telegraph process and diffusion with stochastic resetting.

Title: Better Together: Cross and Joint Covariances Enhance Signal Detectability in Undersampled Data
Authors: Arabind Swain, Sean Alexander Ridout, Ilya Nemenman
Abstract: Many data-science applications involve detecting a shared signal between two high-dimensional variables. Using random matrix theory methods, we determine when such signal can be detected and reconstructed from sample correlations, despite the background of sampling noise induced correlations. We consider three different covariance matrices constructed from two high-dimensional variables: their individual self covariance, their cross covariance, and the self covariance of the concatenated (joint) variable, which incorporates the self and the cross correlation blocks. We observe the expected Baik, Ben Arous, and Péché detectability phase transition in all these covariance matrices, and we show that joint and cross covariance matrices always reconstruct the shared signal earlier than the self covariances. Whether the joint or the cross approach is better depends on the mismatch of dimensionalities between the variables. We discuss what these observations mean for choosing the right method for detecting linear correlations in data and how these findings may generalize to nonlinear statistical dependencies.

Title: Understanding the fill-factor limit of organic solar cells
Authors: Huotian Zhang, Jun Yuan, Tong Wang, Nurlan Tokmoldin, Rokas Jasiunas, Yiting Liu, Manasi Pranav, Yuxuan Li, Xiaolei Zhang, Vidmantas Gulbinas, Safa Shoaee, Yingping Zou, Veaceslav Coropceanu, Artem A. Bakulin, Dieter Neher, Thomas Kirchartz, Feng Gao
Abstract: Although the power conversion efficiencies of organic solar cells (OSCs) have surpassed 20%, they still lag behind commercial inorganic solar cells and emerging perovskite solar cells. To bridge this efficiency gap, improving the fill factor (FF) is critical, provided other photovoltaic parameters are not compromised. However, the fundamental understanding of the FF in OSCs remains incomplete. In this work, we systematically investigate a wide range of OSCs with the FF values spanning 0.27 to 0.80, and analyse the effect of free charge generation and recombination on the FF in OSCs. To explain our observations, we developed an analytical model that quantitatively correlates the applied electric field with the energetics of excited states in donor-acceptor blends. By combining device characterisation, spectroscopy, and theoretical modelling, we reveal that the Stark effect and the field-dependent charge transfer significantly impact the FF in state-of-the-art OSCs with low voltage losses. Our findings highlight that suppressing geminate decay by increasing exciton lifetime is a promising strategy for boosting the FF and achieving future efficiency gains in OSCs.

Title: Steinberg-Guinan strength model for rhenium
Authors: Damian C. Swift
Abstract: Rhenium, Re, is used as an x-ray shield in laser-driven material property experiments, where its strength at high pressures can be a consideration in the design, modeling, and interpretation. We present a Steinberg-Guinan (SG) strength model for Re, tailored for use in high-pressure dynamic loading simulations. Parameters for the SG model were derived from recent atom-in-jellium predictions of the shear modulus under compression and experimental data on work-hardening from rolled-bar studies. The ambient shear modulus was fixed to the measured value, and the pressure-hardening parameter was fitted to the atom-in-jellium predictions up to 1 TPa. The shear modulus model was still a reasonable fit beyond 25 TPa. Thermal softening was estimated from the thermal expansivity and bulk modulus. Work-hardening parameters were extracted by fitting the model to Knoop microhardness measurements under known plastic strains. The resulting model captures the observed hardening behavior but predicts significantly lower flow stresses at high pressures than diamond anvil cell observations suggest, implying that Re may exhibit enhanced strength at megabar pressures. These results provide a basis for improved modeling of strength in Re under extreme conditions and suggest directions for further theoretical and experimental investigation.

Title: Ultrafast Faraday Rotation Probe of Chiral Phonon-Polaritons in LiNbO3
Authors: Megan F. Biggs, Sin-hang (Enoch)Ho, Aldair Alejandro, Matthew Lutz, Clayton D. Moss, Jeremy A. Johnson
Abstract: Time reversal symmetry breaking motion of chiral phonon-polaritons in LiNbO3 is probed via the ultrafast Faraday effect. By combining a pair of perpendicularly polarized THz pulses with the right relative delay, we create a chiral THz driving field to excite chiral phonon-polaritons. The chiral atomic motion combines with the inverse Faraday effect from the circularly polarized THz pump to induce a magnetic moment field in the nonmagnetic material, LiNbO3. We attempt to quantify the strength of the magnetic field with Faraday rotation probe measurements. The direction of the Faraday signal flips when the input THz pulse is changed from left- to right-circular polarization, and we estimate a strong induced magnetic field strength of ~11 Tesla based on the Faraday rotation.

Title: Fabrication of microstructured devices of the unconventional superconductor CeCoIn5 for investigations of isolated grain boundaries
Authors: Sanu Mishra, Sean M. Thomas, Rod Mccabe, Eric D. Bauer, Filip Ronning
Abstract: Grain boundaries are critical for determining the functionality of polycrystalline materials. Here we present on the structural $\&$ transport properties of grain boundaries in the unconventional superconductor CeCoIn$_5$. We provide a detailed recipe for the fabrication of isolated grain boundary devices from of as-grown polycrystalline samples of CeCoIn$_5$. Electron backscattered diffraction imaging of polycrystalline CeCoIn$_5$ samples reveals an abundance of $90^\circ$ misorientation grain boundaries suggesting a preferential nucleation of CeCoIn$_5$ grains with 90$^\circ$ misorientation over a random distribution of grain orientations. Transport measurements across grain boundary devices establish coherence of superconductivity and allows us to establish a lower bound on the critical current density for the grain boundaries. Our work opens new possibilities for fabrication of quantum devices such as Josephson-junctions out of bulk unconventional superconducting materials.

Title: Magnetic Excitations of a Half-Filled Tl-based Cuprate
Authors: I. Biało, Q. Wang, J. Küspert, X. Hong, L. Martinelli, O. Gerguri, Y. Chan, K. von Arx, O. K. Forslund, W. R. Pudełko, C. Lin, N. C. Plumb, Y. Sassa, D. Betto, N. B. Brookes, M. Rosmus, N. Olszowska, M. D. Watson, T. K. Kim, C. Cacho, M. Horio, M. Ishikado, H. M. Rønnow, J. Chang
Abstract: Strong electron correlations drive Mott insulator transitions. Yet, there exists no framework to classify Mott insulators by their degree of correlation. Cuprate superconductors, with their tunable doping and rich phase diagrams, offer a unique platform to investigate the evolution of those interactions. However, spectroscopic access to a clean half-filled Mott-insulating state is lacking in compounds with the highest superconducting onset temperature. To fill this gap, we introduce a pristine, half-filled thallium-based cuprate system, Tl$_2$Ba$_5$Cu$_4$O$_{10+x}$ (Tl2504). Using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), we probe long-lived magnon excitations and uncover a pronounced kink in the magnon dispersion, marked by a simultaneous change in group velocity and lifetime broadening. Modeling the dispersion within a Hubbard-Heisenberg approach, we extract the interaction strength and compare it with other cuprate systems. Our results establish a cuprate universal relation between electron-electron interaction and magnon zone-boundary dispersion. Superconductivity seems to be optimal at intermediate correlation strength, suggesting an optimal balance between localization and itinerancy.

Title: Magnetism of kagome metals $\left(\text{Fe}_{1-x} \text{Co}_{x}\right) \text{Sn}$ studied by $μ$SR

Cava, Sudarshan Sharma, Mathew Pula, Graeme M. Luke, Kenji M. Kojima, Yasutomo J. Uemura
Abstract: We study the magnetic properties of the metallic kagome system $\left(\mathrm{Fe}_{1-x} \mathrm{Co}_{x}\right) \mathrm{Sn}$ by a combination of Muon Spin Relaxation ($\mu \mathrm{SR}$), magnetic susceptibility and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) measurements, in single crystal specimens with Co concentrations $\mathrm{x}=0,0.11,0.8$. In the undoped antiferromagnetic compound FeSn, we find possible signatures for a previously unidentified phase that sets in at $T^*\sim 50$ K, well beneath the Neel temperature $T_N \sim 376$ K, as indicated by a peak in the relaxation rate $1/T_1$ observed in zero field (ZF) and longitudinal field (LF) $\mu \mathrm{SR}$ measurements, with a corresponding anomaly in the ac and dc-susceptibility, and an increase in the static width $1/T_2$ in ZF measurements. No signatures of spatial symmetry breaking are found in STM down to $7$ K. In $\mathrm{Fe}_{0.2} \mathrm{Co}_{0.8} \mathrm{Sn}$, we find canonical spin glass behavior with freezing temperature $T_{g} \sim 3.5 \mathrm{~K}$; the ZF and LF time spectra exhibit results similar to those observed in dilute alloy spin glasses CuMn and AuFe, with a critical behavior of $1 / T_{1}$ at $T_{g}$ and $1 / \mathrm{T}_{1}\rightarrow 0$ as $T \rightarrow 0$. The absence of spin dynamics at low temperatures makes a clear contrast to the spin dynamics observed by $\mu \mathrm{SR}$ in many geometrically frustrated spin systems on insulating kagome, pyrochlore, and triangular lattices. The spin glass behavior of CoSn doped with dilute Fe moments is shown to originate primarily from the randomness of doped Fe moments rather than due to geometrical frustration of the underlying lattice.

Title: Scan calculation of the density of states: real space cluster perturbation theory applied to inhomogeneous Hubbard model in one dimension
Authors: Kaito Matsuki, Chisa Hotta, Kenichi Asano
Abstract: We present the spectral analysis of a one-dimensional Hubbard model with a parabolic potential, using a real-space cluster perturbation theory (rCPT) designed to study spatially inhomogeneous electron systems with strong correlation. It is a natural extension of the conventional CPT to inhomogeneous cases by computing local Green's functions while averaging over multiple cluster boundaries. We find that the local density of states of at each site mirrors that of a homogeneous system with the same local filling. This insight offers a perspective on spectral evolution in inhomogeneous systems used to scan the occupancy-dependent features of the homogeneous system, making this setup a practical one-shot spectroscopy tool for ultracold atoms in harmonic traps.

Title: Strain effects on the fluctuation properties in noncollinear antiferromagnets: a first-principles and macrospin-based study
Authors: Mohammad M. Rahman, Farzad Mahfouzi, Matthew W. Daniels, Mark D. Stiles
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of epitaxial strain effects on the magnetic fluctuation properties of Mn$_3$Sn noncollinear antiferromagnets. Employing density functional theory (DFT), we uncover significant strain-induced modifications to key magnetic parameters, including magnetic anisotropy and both bilinear and biquadratic exchange interactions. Our findings reveal that the biquadratic exchange, often neglected, plays a crucial role in defining the magnetic energy landscape and its response to strain. These microscopic changes directly impact the energy barriers governing magnetic switching, thereby influencing thermal stability and fluctuation rates. Using macrospin-based simulations based on DFT-derived parameters, we provide a quantitative analysis of the macroscopic magnetic fluctuations influenced by these microscopic interactions. These insights are particularly relevant for applications requiring precisely controlled magnetic behavior, such as hardware for probabilistic computing.

Title: Bulk Nanostructured Zirconia Ceramics with High Hardness and Toughness via Integration of High-Pressure Torsion and Spark Plasma Sintering
Authors: Kaveh Edalati, Koji Morita, Shivam Dangwal, Zenji Horita
Abstract: Developing nanostructured bulk ceramics is a major challenge when conventional high-temperature sintering is employed for consolidation. In the current investigation, yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) with a composition of ZrO2 - 3 mol% Y2O3 is first treated using high-pressure torsion (HPT) and further consolidated using spark plasma sintering (SPS) to produce a nanostructured bulk sample. The material demonstrates phase transformations from tetragonal to dislocation-decorated monoclinic by HPT and reversely transforms to the tetragonal phase after the SPS process while maintaining a mean grain size of 80 nm and large numbers of dislocations. The consolidated ceramic exhibits a density of 6.07 g/cm3 (99% relative density) with a high hardness of 1500 Hv, which is reasonably consistent with the prediction of the Hall-Petch relationship. Examination of the indented areas during the hardness test confirms the absence of cracks, indicating good fracture toughness (KIC) because of the presence of dislocations, while the sample processed only by SPS and without HPT processing forms numerous cracks by indentation and exhibits low KIC.

Title: Monopole Traps for Position-Based Information Coding
Authors: Prakash Timsina, Andres Chappa, Deema Alyones, Boris Kiefer, Ludi Miao
Abstract: We propose a spin-ice-based heterostructure capable of encoding magnetic monopole quasiparticle positions for non-volatile information storage applications. Building upon two-dimensional magnetic monopole gases formed at the interface between 2-in-2-out spin ice and all-in-all-out antiferromagnetic pyrochlore iridate, the design introduces a 3-in-1-out/1-in-3-out fragmented barrier layer into the spin-ice matrix, defining two energetically stable monopole traps. The occupancy of these traps can be deterministically controlled by an externally applied magnetic field. Monte Carlo simulations reveal robust bistable switching, thermal stability below 0.22 K, and fully reversible field-driven transitions, demonstrating the system's potential for reliable, repeatable memory operation. Crucially, the heterostructure exhibits emergent ferromagnetism linked to monopole position, enabling non-destructive readout of the memory state via spatially resolved magnetic imaging. Unlike topological carriers such as skyrmions, monopoles confined at the sub-nanometer scale offer three orders of magnitude higher information density. These results establish these monopole-trap heterostructures as a scalable platform for next-generation ultra-compact memory technologies.

Title: Magnetoresistance in the Extreme Quantum Limit: Field-Induced Crossover to the Unitarity Limit
Authors: Shuto Tago, Akiyoshi Yamada, Yuki Fuseya
Abstract: We theoretically investigate magnetoresistance (MR) in the extreme quantum limit (EQL), where the kinetic energy becomes significantly smaller than the cyclotron energy, using the Kubo formula with Green's functions and the $T$-matrix approximation. We uncover a magnetic-field-induced crossover in the scattering rate: $1/\tau \propto B^2$ in the Born regime and $1/\tau \propto B^{-2}$ in the unitarity limit. This crossover gives rise to distinct MR behaviors in the EQL, characterized by linear transverse MR ($\rho_{xx} \propto B$) and negative longitudinal MR ($\rho_{zz} \propto B^{-2}$). This dichotomy implies insulating behavior when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the current, and metallic behavior when it is parallel. In the unitarity limit, we further derive a universal relation that enables direct experimental determination of the impurity density from $\rho_{xx}$ and $\rho_{xy}$. Our results establish a quantum--classical correspondence that remains valid even in the EQL, provided that the field dependences of the scattering rate and quantum corrections are properly incorporated.

Title: Anisotropic Magnetism in Gd$_2$B$_5$
Authors: Maximilien F. Debbas, Takehito Suzuki, Alex H. Mayo, Mun K. Chan, Joseph G. Checkelsky
Abstract: We report the synthesis of single crystals of Gd$_2$B$_5$ through a ruthenium-gadolinium flux method. The Gd$_2$B$_5$ system is a member of the monoclinic $P21/c$ (No. 14) space group and realizes lattices of gadolinium atoms in the $(1\,0\,0)$ plane. We characterized the sample through orientation-dependent electrical transport, magnetization, magnetic torque, and heat capacity measurements to probe the magnetic anisotropy of the system and map out its phase diagram. Gd$_2$B$_5$ realizes two zero-field ordered phases M$_1$ and M$_2$, as well as a third field-induced ordered phase M$_\perp$ arising when the magnetic field is applied in the $(1\,0\,0)$ plane.

Title: Universal Magnetic Phases in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$

Abstract: Twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) has emerged as a robust platform for exploring correlated topological phases, notably supporting fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states at zero magnetic field across a wide range of twist angles. The evolution of magnetism and topology with twist angle remains an open question. Here, we systematically map the magnetic phase diagram of tMoTe$_2$ using local optical spectroscopy and scanning nanoSQUID-on-tip (nSOT) magnetometry. We identify spontaneous ferromagnetism at moiré filling factors $\nu = -1$ and $-3$ over a twist angle range from 2.1$^\circ$ to 3.7$^\circ$, revealing a universal, twist-angle-insensitive ferromagnetic phase. At 2.1$^\circ$, we further observe robust ferromagnetism at $\nu = -5$, absent in the devices with larger twist angle -- a signature of the flattening of higher bands in this twist angle range. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal a contrasting twist-angle dependence of the Curie temperatures between $\nu = -1$ and $\nu = -3$, indicating distinct interplay between exchange interaction and bandwidth for the two Chern bands. Despite spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, we find no evidence of a topological gap at $\nu = -3$; however, fragile correlated topological phases could be obscured by the device disorder evident in our spatially resolved measurements. Our results establish a global framework for understanding and controlling magnetic order in tMoTe$_2$ and highlight its potential for accessing correlated topological phases in higher energy Chern band.

Title: Quantum Criticality by Interaction Frustration in a Square-Planar Lattice
Authors: Yi-Qiang Lin, Chang-Chao Liu, Jia-Xin Li, Bai-Jiang Lv, Kai-Xin Ye, Jia-Wen Zhang, Si-Qi Wu, Ya-Nan Zhang, Ye Chen, Jia-Yi Lu, Jing Li, Hua-Xun Li, Hao Li, Yi Liu, Cao Wang, Yun-Lei Sun, Hao Jiang, Hui-Qiu Yuan, Guang-Han Cao
Abstract: We report experimental and theoretical investigations on ThCr$_2$Ge$_2$C, a metallic compound in which Cr$_2$C planes form a square-planar lattice. Neutron powder diffraction, magnetization, and specific heat measurements reveal no evidence of long-range magnetic order or short-range spin freezing down to 70~mK. Quantum critical behavior was indicated through logarithmic divergences in both the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat divided by temperature. Resistivity measurements exhibit non-Fermi-liquid behavior, with a Fermi liquid recovered under magnetic fields or high pressures. First-principles calculations identify competing nearest-neighbor ($J_1$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($J_2$) exchange interactions, with $J_2/J_1 \sim -0.5$, pointing to strong magnetic frustration. The interaction frustration is reduced, and magnetically ordered phases are stabilized upon the application of negative or positive pressures. This work offers a rare example of zero-field, ambient pressure quantum criticality mainly driven by interaction frustration in a square lattice.

Title: Transparency versus Anderson localization in one-dimensional disordered stealthy hyperuniform layered media
Authors: Michael A. Klatt, Paul J. Steinhardt, Salvatore Torquato
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of disordered stealthy hyperuniform layered media ranging up to 10,000 thin slabs of high-dielectric constant separated by intervals of low dielectric constant that show no apparent evidence of Anderson localization of electromagnetic waves or deviations from transparency for a continuous band of frequencies ranging from zero up to some value $\omega_T$. The results are consistent with the strong-contrast formula including its tight upper bound on $\omega_T$ and with previous simulations on much smaller systems. We utilize a transfer matrix method to compute the Lyaponov exponents, which we show is a more reliable method for detecting Anderson localization by applying it to a range of systems with common types of disorder known to exhibit localization, such as perturbed periodic lattices. The Lyaponov exponents for these systems with ordinary disorder show clear evidence of localization, in contrast to the cases of perfectly periodically spaced slabs and disordered stealthy hyperuniform layered systems. As with any numerical study, one should be cautious about drawing definitive conclusions. There remains the challenge of determining whether one-dimensional disordered stealthy hyperuniform layered media possess a finite localization length on some scale much larger than our already large system size or, alternatively, are exceptions to the standard Anderson localization theorems.

Title: Observation of Superconducting Solitons by Terahertz-Light-Driven Persistent Pseudo-Spin Coherence
Authors: M. Mootz, C. Vaswani, C. Huang, K. J. Lee, A. Khatri, P. Mandal, J. H. Kang, L. Luo, I. E. Perakis, C. B. Eom, J. Wang
Abstract: Overcoming the decoherence bottleneck remains a central challenge for advancing coherent superconducting quantum device and information technologies. Solitons -- non-dispersive wave packets stabilized by the collective synchronization of quantum excitations -- offer a robust pathway to mitigating dephasing, yet their realization in superconductors has remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report the observation of a driven soliton state in epitaxial thin films of an iron-based superconductor (Co-doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$), induced by intense, multi-cycle terahertz (THz) periodic driving. The dynamical transition to this soliton state is marked by the emergence of Floquet-like spectral sidebands that exhibit a strongly nonlinear dependence on THz laser field strength and a resonant enhancement with temperature. Quantum kinetic simulations corroborate these observations, allowing us to underpin the emergence of synchronized Anderson pseudo-spin oscillations -- analogous to Dicke superradiance -- mediated by persistent order parameter oscillations. In this coherently driven state, the observed sidebands result from difference-frequency mixing between the THz drive and persistent soliton dynamics. These findings establish a robust framework for coherently driving and controlling superconducting soliton time-crystal-like phases using low dissipation, time-periodic THz fields, enabling prospects for THz-speed quantum gate operations, long-lived quantum memory, and robust quantum sensing based on enhanced macroscopic pseudo-spin coherence.

Title: Sequential Circuit as Generalized Symmetry on Lattice
Authors: Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Xinyu Liu, Xie Chen
Abstract: Generalized symmetry extends the usual notion of symmetry to ones that are of higher-form, acting on subsystems, non-invertible, etc. The concept was originally defined in the field theory context using the idea of topological defects. On the lattice, an immediate consequence is that a symmetry twist is moved across the system by a sequential quantum circuit. In this paper, we ask how to obtain the full, potentially non-invertible symmetry action from the unitary sequential circuit and how the connection to sequential circuit constrains the properties of the generalized symmetries. We find that for symmetries that contain the trivial symmetry operator as a fusion outcome, which we call annihilable symmetries, the sequential circuit fully determines the symmetry action and puts various constraints on their fusion. In contrast, for unannihilable symmetries, like that whose corresponding twist is the Cheshire string, a further 1D sequential circuit is needed for the full description. Matrix product operator and tensor network operator representations play an important role in our discussion.

Title: CLuP practically achieves $\sim 1.77$ positive and $\sim 0.33$ negative Hopfield model ground state free energy
Authors: Mihailo Stojnic
Abstract: We study algorithmic aspects of finding $n$-dimensional \emph{positive} and \emph{negative} Hopfield ($\pm$Hop) model ground state free energies. This corresponds to classical maximization of random positive/negative semi-definite quadratic forms over binary $\left \{\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \right \}^n$ vectors. The key algorithmic question is whether these problems can be computationally efficiently approximated within a factor $\approx 1$. Following the introduction and success of \emph{Controlled Loosening-up} (CLuP-SK) algorithms in finding near ground state energies of closely related Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models [82], we here propose a CLuP$\pm$Hop counterparts for $\pm$Hop models. Fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [78] is utilized to characterize CLuP$\pm$Hop \emph{typical} dynamics. An excellent agreement between practical performance and theoretical predictions is observed. In particular, for $n$ as small as few thousands CLuP$\pm$Hop achieve $\sim 1.77$ and $\sim 0.33$ as the ground state free energies of the positive and negative Hopfield models. At the same time we obtain on the 6th level of lifting (6-spl RDT) corresponding theoretical thermodynamic ($n\rightarrow\infty$) limits $\approx 1.7784$ and $\approx 0.3281$. This positions determining Hopfield models near ground state energies as \emph{typically} easy problems. Moreover, the very same 6th lifting level evaluations allow to uncover a fundamental intrinsic difference between two models: $+$Hop's near optimal configurations are \emph{typically close} to each other whereas the $-$Hop's are \emph{typically far away}.

Title: In-Plane Magnetic Anisotropy and Large topological Hall Effect in Self-Intercalated Ferromagnet Cr1.61Te2
Authors: Yalei Huang, Na Zuo, Zheyi Zhang, Xiangzhuo Xing, Xinyu Yao, Anlei Zhang, Haowei Ma, Chunqiang Xu, Wenhe Jiao, Wei Zhou, Raman Sankar, Dong Qian, Xiaofeng Xu
Abstract: Self-intercalated chromium tellurides Cr1+xTe2 have garnered growing attention due to their high-temperature ferromagnetism, tunable spin structures and air stability, all of which are vital for versatile applications in next-generation memory and information technology. Here, we report strong magnetic anisotropy and a large topological Hall effect (THE) in self-intercalated Cr1.61Te2 single crystals, which are both highly desirable properties for future spintronic applications. Our results demonstrate that Cr1.61Te2 is a soft ferromagnet with strong in-plane magnetic anisotropy. Remarkably, distinct THE behaviors are observed in different temperature regimes, reflecting the intricate spin structures and competing exchange interactions. More interestingly, a large topological Hall resistivity, induced by microscopic non-coplanar spin structures, emerges in the temperature range 70-240 K, reaching a maximum value of 0.93 {\mu}{\Omega} cm at 150 K. Moreover, a sign-reversed and weak THE is observed at low temperatures below ~70 K, indicating the emergence of an additional topological spin structure with opposite topological charges. This work not only offers valuable insights into the correlation between magnetocrystalline anisotropy and topological phenomena in Cr1+xTe2 systems, but also provides a robust platform for engineering the evolution of complex spin textures that can be leveraged in diverse spintronic device applications.

Title: Phase Competition and Rutile Phase Stabilization of Growing GeO2 Films by MOCVD
Authors: Imteaz Rahaman, Botong Li, Hunter D. Ellis, Kathy Anderson, Feng Liu, Michael A. Scarpulla, Kai Fu
Abstract: Rutile germanium dioxide (r-GeO2) is an ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor with potential for ambipolar doping, making it a promising candidate for next-generation power electronics and optoelectronics. Growth of phase-pure r-GeO2 films by vapor phase techniques like metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is challenging because of polymorphic competition from amorphous and quartz GeO2. Here, we introduce seed-driven stepwise crystallization (SDSC) as a segmented growth strategy for obtaining r-GeO2 films on r-TiO2 (001) substrate. SDSC divides the growth into repeated cycles of film deposition and cooling-heating ramps, which suppress the non-rutile phases. We discuss the underlying mechanisms of phase selection during SDSC growth. We demonstrate continuous, phase-pure, partially epitaxial r-GeO2 (001) films exhibiting x-ray rocking curves with a FWHM of 597 arcsec. SDSC-based growth provides a generalizable pathway for selective vapor-phase growth of metastable or unstable phases, offering new opportunities for phase-selective thin-film engineering.

Title: Thermal Hall effect induced by phonon skew-scattering via orbital magnetization
Authors: Taekoo Oh
Abstract: Thermal transport acts as a powerful tool for studying the excitations and physical properties of insulators, where a charge gap suppresses electronic conduction. Recently, the thermal Hall effect has been observed across various materials, including insulators and semiconductors, but its fundamental origin remains unclear. Here, I propose a promising mechanism to explain the emergence of the thermal Hall effect in these systems: axial chiral phonon skew scattering mediated by orbital magnetization. Starting from basic principles, I derive the form and magnitude of the orbital magnetization-phonon coupling using the well-established Haldane model. Using this coupling, I calculate the thermal Hall conductivity and Hall angle as functions of temperature, achieving semi-quantitative agreement with experimental findings. This work enhances our understanding of the role of electron-phonon coupling in thermal transport and provides a pathway to tailor thermal properties in a broad range of materials.

Title: Vortex Refraction at Tilted Superconductor-Normal Metal Interfaces
Authors: Matéo F. L. Roinard-Chauvet, Axel J. M. Deenen, Dirk Grundler
Abstract: We derive a refraction law for superconducting vortices at superconductor/normal metal interfaces. Simulations of the proximity effect under tilted geometries confirm this law and reveal vortex trapping for low effective mass. Under transport currents, we find core displacements due to differing vortex viscosities in the superconductor and normal metal. These results clarify vortex dynamics in proximity-coupled systems and offer design principles for high-current coated superconducting devices.

Title: Spray flame synthesis of Y2O3-MgO nanoparticles for mid-infrared transparent nanocomposite ceramics
Authors: Shuting Lei, Yiyang Zhang, Xing Jin, Yanan Li, Zhu Fang, Shuiqing Li
Abstract: Spray flame synthesis offers a promising method for scalable production of homogeneously mixed Y2O3-MgO nanopowders as next-generation infrared-transparent window material, which has attracted significant attention owing to its excellent optical properties at high temperatures. However, systematic understanding of how flame synthesis parameters influence particle morphology, crystal phase, solid solubility, and subsequent ceramic performance remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we investigated the influence of precursor chemistry on particle crystal phase and examined the solid solubility of MgO in Y2O3 under different flame temperatures, demonstrating that the high-temperature conditions with O2 as dispersion gas allow up to 50 mol% MgO to fully dissolve into Y2O3, far exceeding the equilibrium solubility limit of 7 mol% at the eutectic temperature (2100°C) and near-zero at room temperature. Furthermore, we systematically evaluated how powder characteristics and sintering parameters-including powder deagglomeration methods, vacuum sintering temperature, hot isostatic pressing (HIP) temperature, and initial powder characteristics-affect ceramic microstructures and infrared transmittance. Despite cracking induced by phase transformation and finer particle sizes, ceramics fabricated from oxygen-synthesized monoclinic-dominated powders exhibited superior near-infrared transmittance (56.2% at 1550 nm), attributed to enhanced atomic mixing and effective grain boundary pinning. After optimization, pure cubic phase powders produced intact and crack-free ceramics with outstanding mid-infrared transparency, achieving a maximum transmittance of 84.6% and an average transmittance of 82.3% in 3-5 um range.

Title: Collective Fluorescence of Graphene Quantum Dots on a Halide Perovskite Crystal

Abstract: This study explores the dynamical collective fluorescence of $C_{96}tBu_8$ graphene quantum dots when deposited on the surface of monocrystalline halide perovskite. Despite the tendency of the graphene quantum dots to avoid aggregation in solution and polymer matrices, our findings reveal distinct collective behaviors when deposited on the perovskite surface, here $CH_3NH_3PbBr_3$. We observed small clusters of graphene quantum dots rather than isolated single molecules through confocal fluorescence microscopy. Spectral analysis under continuous illumination shows a back-and-forth dynamical transition between an uncoupled, monomer-like state and a coupled state with a redshifted emission. In some cases, this dynamical process is followed by a drastic one-way increase in fluorescence intensity combined with a shortening of the excited state lifetime, which could characterize the emission of ordered graphene quantum dots within aggregates.

Title: Proposal for realizing Heisenberg-type quantum-spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators
Authors: Masaya Kunimi, Takafumi Tomita
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the Förster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.

Title: Strain-Controlled Topological Phase Transitions and Chern Number Reversal in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets
Authors: Zesen Fu, Mengli Hu, Aolin Li, Haiming Duan, Junwei Liu, Fangping Ouyang
Abstract: We present a theoretical and first-principles study of a two-dimensional altermagnet exhibiting spin-valley locking and strain-tunable topological phases. By constructing a minimal tight-binding model constrained by altermagnetic symmetry, we show that biaxial strain can drive a transition from a trivial insulator to a type-II quantum spin Hall (QSH) phase. Furthermore, we derive an analytical strain-induced perturbation theory that identifies two critical curves, dividing the phase space into four regions corresponding to a trivial insulator, a type-II QSH phase, and two quantum anomalous Hall phases with opposite Chern numbers. Remarkably, the Chern number can be reversed purely by changing the strain direction --without modifying magnetization or applying magnetic fields. The model reveals a universal phase diagram for materials with the same symmetry and valley structure. First-principles calculations on monolayer CrO confirm the predicted topological transitions, establishing strain engineering as an effective route for topological control in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials.

Title: Unconventional spin texture driven by higher-order spin-orbit interactions
Authors: Jiaxuan Wu, Boyun Zeng, Hanghui Chen
Abstract: Spin splitting and the resulting spin texture are central to emerging spintronic applications. In non-centrosymmetric non-magnetic materials containing heavy elements, spin textures are typically governed by low-order, momentum-dependent spin-orbit interactions, such as Rashba spin-orbit interaction with linear or cubic order in crystal momentum. In this work, we use \textit{ab initio} calculations to reveal a previously unidentified spin texture in the conduction bands of a prototypical ferroelectric nitride LaWN$_3$. In addition to the usual $\Gamma$-centered vortex, we find six new vortices and anti-vortices located at non-high-symmetry points near the Brillouin zone center. Furthermore, by combining group-theoretical analysis and $\textbf{k}\cdot\textbf{p}$ perturbation modeling, we show that, constrained by the $C_{3v}$ point group to which ferroelectric LaWN$_3$ belongs, a 7th-order Weyl spin-orbit interaction is essential to reproduce the unconventional spin structure observed in first-principles calculations. We also find that weak electron doping of LaWN$_3$ leads to a Fermi surface whose spin-arrow contour exhibits an unusual epicycloid pattern--a distinctive signature that is experimentally accessible. Our work demonstrates that higher-order spin-orbit interactions are more than perturbative corrections. They can play a dominant role in shaping the spin texture of non-centrosymmetric materials. Our results open up new avenues for designing spintronic devices that exploit multi-chiral spin textures beyond the conventional spin-orbit paradigm.

Title: Influence of Built-in Electric Fields on the Optoelectronic and Catalytic Properties of Two-Dimensional Materials
Authors: Kai Kong, Qiang Wang, Yixuan Li, Yitong Liang
Abstract: In the realm of modern materials science and advanced electronics, ferroelectric materials have emerged as a subject of great intrigue and significance, chiefly due to their remarkable property of reversible spontaneous polarization. This unique characteristic is not just an interesting physical phenomenon; it plays a pivotal role in revolutionizing multiple technological applications, especially in the domains of high-density data storage and the pursuit of fast device operation. In the past few decades, there has been a significant increase in the number of investigations and commercial applications proposed for ferroelectric materials. With the continuous miniaturization of electronic devices and the rapid development of two-dimensional (2D) materials, considerable efforts have been made towards exploring ferroelectricity in 2D materials, driven by the potential for revolutionary advancements in energy storage, data processing, and other emerging technologies. This exploration is fueled by the realization that 2D ferroelectric materials could offer unique properties such as high energy density, fast switching speeds, and scalability, which are crucial for the next generation of electronic devices. The out-of-plane (OOP) ferroelectricity exhibited by these 2D materials is generally more advantageous than the in-plane ferroelectricity, primarily because the vertical polarizability aligns more seamlessly with the requirements of most practical technological applications

Title: Enhancing interfacial thermal conductance in Si/Diamond heterostructures by phonon bridge
Authors: Ershuai Yin, Qiang Li, Wenzhu Luo, Lei Wang
Abstract: This study investigates the mechanism of enhancing interfacial thermal transport performance in Silicon/Diamond (Si/Diamond) heterostructures using the phonon bridge. A heat transfer model for three-layer heterostructures is developed by combining First-principles calculations with the Monte Carlo method. The temperature distribution, spectral heat conductance, and interfacial thermal conductance are compared for Si/Diamond heterostructures with and without a silicon carbide (SiC) interlayer. The results show that the SiC interlayer effectively bridges low-frequency phonons in Si with mid-to-high-frequency phonons in Diamond, which forms a specific phonon bridge, significantly improving interfacial phonon transport. The influence of SiC interlayer thickness is further studied, revealing a size-dependent phonon bridge enhancement. For thin interlayers, intensified phonon boundary scattering weakens the bridging effect. Conversely, excessively thick interlayers increase the bulk thermal resistance, reducing overall interfacial thermal conductance. Thus, an optimal interlayer thickness exists, identified as 40 nm for SiC. Thirteen candidate interlayer materials, including SiC, AlN, {\alpha}-Si3N4, \b{eta}-Si3N4, and AlxGa1-xN (x ranges from 0.1 to 0.9), are compared at various thicknesses. SiC emerges as the most effective interlayer material, increasing interfacial thermal conductance by 46.6% compared to the bilayer heterostructure. AlN ranks second, improving thermal conductance by 21.9%. These findings provide essential insights into the phonon bridge mechanism at heterogeneous interface thermal transport and offer valuable theoretical guidance for designing heterostructures with enhanced thermal transport performance.

Title: Observation of spin-conserving two-spinon continuum in the $S$=1/2 antiferromagnetic chain system Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ using Cu $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
Authors: Kenji Ishii, Kenji Tsutsui, Takayuki Kawamata, Yoji Koike
Abstract: We report a Cu $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of spin excitations in the $S$=1/2 antiferromagnetic chain system Sr$_2$CuO$_3$. The spectral weight observed below the charge-transfer gap appears in two-spinon continuum, indicating the fractionalization of a spin-conserving ($\Delta S = 0$) magnetic excitation into two-spinon states. The intensity of these excitations reaches a maximum near the midpoint between the center and the boundary of the Brillouin zone, and decreases toward the zone boundary; this behavior contrasts with that of the spin-flip ($\Delta S = 1$) excitations typically observed via inelastic neutron scattering or Cu $L_3$-edge RIXS. The momentum dependence of the intensity is described by the spin-exchange dynamical structure factor. A phenomenological analysis of the symmetry between the polarization and the $d$ orbital explains the resonance condition for the two-spinon excitations.

Title: Dynamical signatures and control of time-reversal breaking in twisted nodal superconductors
Authors: Jefferson Tang, Pavel A. Volkov
Abstract: Recent observations of time-reversal breaking superconductivity at twisted cuprate interfaces motivate the development of new approaches to better characterize this emergent phenomenon. Here we study the dynamical properties of the order parameters at the twisted unconventional superconductor interfaces. We reveal the emergence of a soft collective mode (Josephson plasmon) at the time-reversal breaking transition, which can be tuned by temperature, twist angle or magnetic field. Furthermore, nonlinear dynamical responses are shown to contain direct signatures of both the transition and the broken symmetry itself. In particular, we show that second harmonic generation is a necessary and sufficient condition for the symmetry breaking. We discuss the signatures of our predictions in AC current-driven experiments and show that strong nonlinear driving allows to induce dynamical phase transitions between phases with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Title: Vortex Pinning in Niobium covered by a thin polycrystalline Gold
Authors: Wenbin Li, Ivan Villani, Ylea Vlamidis, Matteo Carrega, Letizia Ferbel, Leonardo Sabattini, Antonio Rossi, Wen Si, Stefano Veronesi, Camilla Coletti, Sergio Pezzini, Masahiro Haze, Yukio Hasegawa, Stefan Heun
Abstract: Owing to its superconducting properties, Niobium (Nb) is an excellent candidate material for superconducting electronics and applications in quantum technology. Here we perform scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy experiments on Nb films covered by a thin gold (Au) film. We investigate the minigap structure of the proximitized region and provide evidence for a highly transparent interface between Nb and Au, beneficial for device applications. Imaging of Abrikosov vortices in presence of a perpendicular magnetic field is reported. The data show vortex pinning by the granular structure of the polycrystalline Au film. Our results show robust and homogeneous superconducting properties of thin Nb film in the presence of a gold capping layer. The Au film not only protects the Nb from surface oxidation but also preserves its excellent superconducting properties.

Title: Electronic Structure of Bimetallic CoRu Catalysts Modulates SWCNT Nucleation
Authors: Alister J. Page, Dan Villamanca, Placidus B. Amama, Ben McLean
Abstract: Nucleation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) via chemical vapour deposition of methane on CoRu bimetallic nanoparticles is simulated using quantum chemical molecular dynamics. By varying the Ru loading in the catalyst, we show that Ru decreases catalytic efficiency; C-H bond activation is impeded, key reactive intermediate species become longer-lived on the catalyst surface, and longer carbon chains are stabilised through the earliest stages of SWCNT nucleation. Analysis of the CoRu nanoparticle structure during the CVD process shows that this influence of Ru is indirect, with the catalyst adopting Ru-Co core-shell or segregated structures throughout nucleation, and Co exclusively driving the catalytic decomposition of the methane precursor. We show that the influence of Ru occurs via the electronic structure of the catalyst itself, by lowering the Fermi level of the catalyst due to lower energy 4d/5s states, in a manner consistent with d-band theory.

Title: Antiferromagnetic Order and Magnetic Frustration in the Honeycomb Heavy-Fermion System Ce(Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_{x}$)$_6$Al$_3$: $^{27}$Al and $^{195}$Pt NMR Studies
Authors: Shunsaku Kitagawa, Fumiya Hori, Kenji Ishida, Ryohei Oishi, Yasuyuki Shimura, Takahiro Onimaru, Toshiro Takabatake
Abstract: Heavy-fermion systems with magnetic frustration offer a rich platform for investigating the interplay among Kondo screening, magnetic frustration, and quantum criticality. We report comprehensive $^{27}$Al and $^{195}$Pt nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on polycrystalline Ce(Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_{x}$)$_6$Al$_3$ ($x = 0$, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3). For $x = 0$, the Knight shift, linewidth, and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate reveal a paramagnetic heavy-fermion ground state persisting down to 0.1~K, characterized by a coherence temperature $T_{\mathrm{coh}} \simeq 15$~K. Substituting Pd induces antiferromagnetic order at $T_{\mathrm{N}} \simeq 3.5$~K, while suppressing $T_{\mathrm{coh}}$. Comparison between $x = 0.1$ and $x = 0.3$ reveals a crossover from itinerant spin-density-wave antiferromagnetism to more localized-moment antiferromagnetism, indicating a shift toward the localized side of the Doniach phase diagram. These findings establish Ce(Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_{x}$)$_6$Al$_3$ as a tunable platform to explore the competition between Kondo screening and magnetic frustration.

Title: A Microfluidic Platform for Actin-Based Membrane Remodeling Reveals the Stabilizing Role of Branched Actin Networks on Lipid Microdomains

Abstract: Cell shape changes, essential for processes such as motility or division, are controlled by the actomyosin cortex that actively remodels biological membranes. Their mechanisms can be deciphered in___vitro using biomimetic reconstituted systems, such as giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) with controlled lipid composition coupled to reconstituted actin networks. These assays allow mimicking cell shape changes in controlled biochemical and biophysical environments. However, studying the dynamics of these shape changes on statistically significant populations of GUVs with the possibility to sequentially modify the protein composition of the assay is a major experimental challenge. To address these issues, a microfluidic approach is used to immobilize several dozens of isolated GUVs and monitor membrane and actin network evolution. The loading of the chamber with GUVs and actin is first characterized. Then, the actin-induced remodeling of populations of homogeneous and phase-separated GUVs is monitored and shows that actin networks prevent the coalescence of lipid microdomains and that, in return, the number of domains affects the actin network structure. This microfluidic-based experimental strategy, thus, allows for studying actin-induced membrane deformation in___vitro and can be adapted to other studies on membrane remodeling processes.

Title: aLLoyM: A large language model for alloy phase diagram prediction
Authors: Yuna Oikawa, Guillaume Deffrennes, Taichi Abe, Ryo Tamura, Koji Tsuda
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are general-purpose tools with wide-ranging applications, including in materials science. In this work, we introduce aLLoyM, a fine-tuned LLM specifically trained on alloy compositions, temperatures, and their corresponding phase information. To develop aLLoyM, we curated question-and-answer (Q&A) pairs for binary and ternary phase diagrams using the open-source Computational Phase Diagram Database (CPDDB) and assessments based on CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams). We fine-tuned Mistral, an open-source pre-trained LLM, for two distinct Q&A formats: multiple-choice and short-answer. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning substantially enhances performance on multiple-choice phase diagram questions. Moreover, the short-answer model of aLLoyM exhibits the ability to generate novel phase diagrams from its components alone, underscoring its potential to accelerate the discovery of previously unexplored materials systems. To promote further research and adoption, we have publicly released the short-answer fine-tuned version of aLLoyM, along with the complete benchmarking Q&A dataset, on Hugging Face.

Title: Lattice tuning of charge and spin transport in $β_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons
Authors: Masoumeh Davoudiniya, Jonas Fransson, Biplab Sanyal
Abstract: Lattice vibrations critically shape charge and spin transport by governing carrier scattering, spin-charge interactions and spectral redistribution in nanostructures. In this study, we investigate how electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and structural configurations intertwine in magnetic and nonmagnetic $\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons (BNRs). Using a tight-binding framework with site-dependent hopping parameters extracted from ab initio calculations and incorporating phonons within the Holstein model, we compute phonon-renormalized Green's functions and transport currents via the Landauer-Büttiker formalism. We find that spin-dependent EPC enhances spin-dependent current in magnetic zigzag (ZZ) nanoribbons, driven by phonon-induced inelastic scattering and spin-selective band renormalization. Additionally, we observe an enhancement of charge transport current in the nonmagnetic configurations of $\beta_{12}$-BNRs. Structural variations further induce anisotropic EPC effects, significantly reshaping charge and spin transport. These insights establish EPC as a powerful design lever for optimizing borophene-based logic devices through tailored edge engineering.

Title: Quantum siphoning of finely spaced interlayer excitons in reconstructed MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructures
Authors: Mainak Mondal, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Gaurav Chaudhary, Akshay Singh
Abstract: Atomic reconstruction in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures leads to mesoscopic domains with uniform atomic registry, profoundly altering the local potential landscape. While interlayer excitons in these domains exhibit strong many-body interactions, extent and impact of quantum confinement on their dynamics remains unclear. Here, we reveal that quantum confinement persists in these flat, reconstructed regions. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy uncovers multiple, finely-spaced interlayer exciton states (~ 1 meV separation), and correlated emission lifetimes spanning sub-nanosecond to over 100 nanoseconds across a 10 meV energy window. Cascade-like transitions confirm that these states originate from a single potential well, further supported by calculations. Remarkably, at high excitation rates, we observe transient suppression of emission followed by gradual recovery, a process we term "quantum siphoning". Our results demonstrate that quantum confinement and competing nonlinear dynamics persist beyond the ideal moire paradigm, potentially enabling applications in quantum sensing and modifying exciton dynamics via strain engineering.

Title: Random matrix theory of charge distribution in disordered quantum impurity models
Authors: Maxime Debertolis, Serge Florens
Abstract: We introduce a bare-bone random matrix quantum impurity model, by hybridizing a localized spinless electronic level with a bath of random fermions in the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). While stripped out of correlations effects, this model reproduces some salient features of the impurity charge distribution obtained in previous works on interacting disordered impurity models. Computing by numerical sampling the impurity charge distribution in our model, we find a crossover from a Gaussian distribution (centered on half a charge unit) at large hybridization, to a bimodal distribution (centered both on zero and full occupations of the charge) at small hybridization. In the bimodal regime, a universal $(-3/2)$ power-law is also observed. All these findings are very well accounted for by an analytic surmise computed with a single random electron level in the bath. We also derive an exact functional integral for the general probability distribution function of eigenvalues and eigenstates, that formally captures the statistical behavior of our model for any number $N$ of fermionic orbitals in the bath. In the Gaussian regime and in the limit $N\to\infty$, we are able to solve exactly the random matrix theory (RMT) for the charge distribution, obtaining perfect agreement with the numerics. Our results could be tested experimentally in mesoscopic devices, for instance by coupling a small quantum dot to a chaotic electronic reservoir, and using a quantum point contact as local charge sensor for the quantum dot occupation.

Title: The multiconfigurational ground state of a diradicaloid characterized at the atomic scale
Authors: Elia Turco, Lara Tejerina, Gonçalo Catarina, Andres Ortega-Guerrero, Nils Krane, Leo Gross, Michal Juríček, Shantanu Mishra
Abstract: We report the tip-induced generation and scanning probe characterization of a singlet diradicaloid, consisting of two phenalenyl units connected by an sp-hybridized C$_{4}$ chain, on an ultrathin insulating NaCl surface. The bond-order contrast along the C$_{4}$ chain measured by atomic force microscopy and mapping of charge-state transitions by scanning tunneling microscopy, in conjunction with multiconfigurational calculations, reveal that the molecule exhibits a many-body ground state. Our study experimentally demonstrates the manifestation of strong electronic correlations in the geometric and electronic structures of a single molecule.

Title: Broadband ferromagnetic resonance in Ni-Mn-Ga single crystal
Authors: Luděk Kraus, Denys Musiienko, Martin Kempa, Jaroslav Čapek
Abstract: We present a broadband ferromagnetic resonance study in single crystalline Ni$_{50}$Mn$_{28.1}$Ga$_{21.9}$ in the temperature range from room temperature to 120 °C in which the transformation from martensite to austenite phase takes place. Our measurements demonstrate that a large change (an order of magnitude) in the magnetocrystalline anisotropy at the martensitic phase transformation results in a sharp change of the resonance magnetic field. In a single variant martensite phase, the resonance fields satisfy the Kittel's resonance condition for a thin film with the gyromagnetic factor g = 2.0. With the magnetic field parallel to the easy c-axis of the single variant martensite, the resonance is observed only for frequencies larger than 22 GHz. For the multivariant martensite case, the magnetic coupling between the twin variants can be taken into account for the satisfactory Kittel's fit. We observe a weak magnetocrystalline anisotropy in the austenite phase, just above the reverse martensite transformation, comparable to the previous reports based on different magnetic measurements.

Title: Configurational density of states of finite classical systems
Authors: Sergio Davis, Boris Maulén
Abstract: In this work, using a microcanonical framework, we provide an explicit inversion formula that allows the calculation of the configurational density of states from the total density of states without resorting to the inversion of the Laplace transform. From this formula, several results can be obtained for the thermodynamics of classical systems composed of a few degrees of freedom, while at the same time recovering the well-known behavior in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Configurational density of states of power-law potentials and the virial theorem in steady states
Authors: Sergio Davis
Abstract: In this brief note, the configurational density of states of a system of particles interacting via power-law pair potentials is computed exactly. The result is consistent with a constant microcanonical heat capacity. The well-known form of the virial theorem for this class of systems is recovered using only the obtained configurational density of states, and shown to be valid beyond the canonical and microcanonical ensembles, in general steady states.

Title: Inducing ferromagnetism by structural engineering in a strongly spin-orbit coupled oxide

Abstract: Magnetic materials with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are essential for the advancement of spin-orbitronic devices, as they enable efficient spin-charge conversion, complex magnetic structures, spin-valley physics, topological phases and other exotic phenomena. 5d transition-metal oxides such as SrIrO3 feature large SOC, but usually show paramagnetic behavior due to broad bands and a low density of states at the Fermi level, accompanied by a relatively low Coulomb repulsion. Here, we unveil ferromagnetism in 5d SrIrO3 thin films grown on SrTiO3 (111). Through substrate-induced structural engineering, a zigzag stacking of three-unit-cell thick layers along the [111] direction is achieved, stabilizing a ferromagnetic state at the interfaces. Magnetotransport measurements reveal an anomalous Hall effect below ~30 K and hysteresis in the Hall conductivity below 7 K, indicating ferromagnetic ordering. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism further supports these results. Theoretical analysis suggests that the structural engineering of the IrO6 octahedral network enhances the density of states at the Fermi level and thus stabilizes Stoner ferromagnetism. This work highlights the potential of structurally engineered 5d oxides for spin-orbitronic devices, where efficient control of SOC-induced magnetic phases by electric currents can lead to lower energy consumption and improved performance in next-generation device technologies.

Title: Active spin model for cell assemblies on 1D substrates
Authors: Harshal Potdar, Ignacio Pagonabarraga, Sudipto Muhuri
Abstract: The experimental use of micropatterned quasi-1D substrates has emerged as an useful experimental tool to study the nature of cell-cell interactions and gain insight on collective behaviour of cell colonies. Inspired by these experiments, we propose an active spin model to investigate the emergent properties of the cell assemblies. The lattice gas model incorporates the interplay of self-propulsion, polarity directional switching, intra-cellular attraction, and contact Inhibition Locomotion (CIL). In the absence of vacancies, which corresponds to a confluent cell packing on the substrate, the model reduces to an equilibrium spin model which can be solved exactly. In the presence of vacancies, the clustering is controlled by a dimensionless Peclet Number, Q - the ratio of magnitude of self-propulsion rate and directional switching rate of particles. In the absence of CIL interactions, we invoke a mapping to Katz-Lebowitz-Spohn(KLS) model to determine an exact analytical form of the cluster size distribution in the limit Q << 1. In the limit of Q >> 1, the cluster size distribution exhibits an universal scaling behaviour (in an approximate sense), such that the distribution function can be expressed as a scaled function of Q, particle density and CIL interaction strength. We characterize the phase behaviour of the system in terms of contour plots of average cluster size. The average cluster size exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on CIL interaction strength, attractive interaction strength, and self-propulsion.

Title: Stochastic resonance in disordered charge-density-wave systems
Authors: Francesco Valiera, Antonio Picano, Martin Eckstein
Abstract: Ultrafast disordering observed after photo-excitation challenges the conventional picture of photo-induced transitions where symmetry-breaking takes place along a single collective coordinate. We propose that key spectroscopic signatures of these transient disordered states can be revealed through stochastic resonance, a hallmark of nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Studying the disordered phase of Holstein model we show that, at given frequency, the linear response as a function of temperature has a peak, which indicates enhanced coherent switching between metastable configurations. From this resonance, we extract the intrinsic stochastic transition timescale and energy barrier separating equivalent local minima. This mechanism offers a new perspective to identify and characterize hidden disordered phases in driven many-body systems.

Title: Nonclassical Photon-Assisted Transport in Superconducting Tunnel Junctions
Authors: Matthias Hübler, Juan Carlos Cuevas, Wolfgang Belzig
Abstract: Advances in circuit quantum electrodynamics have enabled the generation of arbitrary nonclassical microwave states and paved the way for addressing novel physics questions. Here, we present a theoretical study of the electrical current in a Josephson tunnel junction interacting with a nonclassical electromagnetic environment. This allows us to generalize classical transport phenomena like photon-assisted tunneling and Shapiro steps to the quantum regime. We predict that the analysis of the supercurrent in such a setup enables the complete reconstruction of quantum states of the electromagnetic environment, something that is not possible with normal tunnel junctions.

Title: Unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators
Authors: Wei Jia, Yuping Tian, Huanhuan Yang, Xiangru Kong, Zhi-Hao Huang, Wei-Jiang Gong, Jun-Hong An
Abstract: Exploring topological matters with exotic quantum states can update the understanding of topological phases and broaden the classification of topological materials. Here, we report a class of unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators (HyOTIs), which simultaneously host various different higher-order topological states in a single $d$-dimensional ($d$D) system. Such topological states exhibit a unique bulk-boundary correspondence that is different from first-order topological states, higher-order topological states, and the coexistence of both. Remarkably, we develop a generic surface theory to precisely capture them and firstly discover a $3$D unconventional HyOTI protected by inversion symmetry, which renders both second-order (helical) and third-order (corner) topological states in one band gap and exhibits a novel bulk-edge-corner correspondence. By adjusting the parameters of the system, we also observe the nontrivial phase transitions between the inversion-symmetric HyOTI and other conventional phases. We further propose a circuit-based experimental scheme to detect these interesting results. Particularly, we demonstrate that a modified tight-binding model of bismuth can support the unconventional HyOTI, suggesting a possible route for its material realization. This work shall significantly advance the research of hybrid topological states in both theory and experiment.

Abstract: Crystalline films offer various physical properties based on the modulation of their thicknesses and atomic structures. The layer-by-layer assembly of atomically thin crystals provides powerful means to arbitrarily design films at the atomic-level, which are unattainable with existing growth technologies. However, atomically-clean assembly of the materials with high scalability and reproducibility remains challenging. We report programmed crystal assembly (PCA) of graphene and monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (ML hBN), assisted by van der Waals interactions, to form wafer-scale films of pristine interfaces with near-unity yield. The atomic configurations of the films are tailored with layer-resolved compositions and in-plane crystalline orientations. We demonstrate batch-fabricated tunnel device arrays with modulation of the resistance over orders of magnitude by thickness-control of the hBN barrier with single-atom precision, and large-scale, twisted multilayer graphene with programmable electronic band structures and crystal symmetries. Our results constitute an important development in the artificial design of large-scale films.

Title: Cation Engineering of Cu-Doped CsPbI3: Lead Substitution and Dimensional Reduction for Improved Scintillation Performance
Authors: David Hadid Sidiq, Somnath Mahato, Tobias Haposan, Michal Makowski, Dominik Kowal, Marcin Eugeniusz Witkowski, Winicjusz Drozdowski, Arramel, Muhammad Danang Birowosuto
Abstract: To date, inorganic halide perovskite nanocrystals show promising contributions in emerging luminescent materials due to their high tolerance to defects. In particular, the development of cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) has shown its efficiency for light-harvesting properties. However, further implementation is hindered due to the toxicity of the lead content. Therefore, in this study, we introduced Cu atoms to partially substitute Pb atoms (5% Cu) in the CsPbI3 lattice as a solution to reduce Pb toxicity. A partial lead material is substituted using Cu displays a larger Stokes shift (-67 nm) compared to the pristine, and resulted doped CsPbI3 not undergo the undesired self absorption. An outcome is focused on the champion of fast-component (tau_1) decay time ~0.6 ns. Temperature-dependent radioluminescence outlines an incremental change in the emission intensity is marginally centered at 713 +- 16 nm, which indicates Cu-doped CsPbI3 is not greatly affected by temperature. In addition, we report that the light yield (LY) pristine CsPbI3 after doping is increased to 3.0 +- 0.8 photons/keV. Our work provides physical insights into a tunable scintillation property using transition metal doping toward lead-free based scintillating perovskites.

Title: Density-functional theory study of the interaction between NV$^{-}$ centers and native defects in diamond
Authors: Gabriel I. López-Morales, Joanna M. Zajac, Tom Delord, Carlos A. Meriles, Cyrus E. Dreyer
Abstract: The NV$^{-}$ color center in diamond has been demonstrated as a nanoscale sensor for quantum metrology. However, the properties that make it ideal for measuring, e.g., minute electric and magnetic fields also make it sensitive to imperfections in the diamond host. In this work, we quantify the impact of nearby native defects on the many-body states of NV$^{-}$. We combine previous quantum embedding results of strain and electric-field susceptibilities of NV$^{-}$ with density-functional theory calculations on native defects. The latter are used to parametrize continuum models in order to extrapolate the effects of native defects up to the micrometer scale. We show that under ideal measuring conditions, the optical properties of NV$^{-}$ are measurably affected by the strain caused by single carbon interstitials and vacancies up to 200 nm away; in contrast, the NV$^{-}$ is measurably affected by the electric field of such charged (neutral) native defects within a micron (100 nm). Finally, we show how measuring multiple individual NV$^{-}$ centers in the vicinity of a native defect can be used to determine the nature of the defect and its charge state.

Title: Thermodynamically driven tilt grain boundaries of monolayer crystals using catalytic liquid alloys
Authors: Min-Yeong Choi, Chang-Won Choi, Dong-Yeong Kim, Moon-Ho Jo, Yong-Sung Kim, Si-Young Choi, Cheol-Joo Kim
Abstract: We report a method to precisely control the atomic defects at grain boundaries (GBs) of monolayer MoS2 by vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth using sodium molybdate liquid alloys, which serve as growth catalysts to guide the formations of the thermodynamically most stable GB structure. The Mo-rich chemical environment of the alloys results in Mo-polar 5|7 defects with a yield exceeding 95%. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity of VLS-grown polycrystalline MoS2 films markedly exceeds that of the films exhibiting abundant S 5|7 defects, which are kinetically driven by vapor-solid-solid growths. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the enhanced PL intensity is due to the suppression of non-radiative recombination of charged excitons with donor-type defects of adsorbed Na elements on S 5|7 defects. Catalytic liquid alloys can aid in determining a type of atomic defect even in various polycrystalline 2D films, which accordingly provides a technical clue to engineer their properties.

Title: Decorated Clusters and Geometrical Frustration in Cluster Spin Glass: A Random Graph Approach
Authors: S. G. Magalhaes, F. M. Zimmer, R. Erichsen Jr
Abstract: We develop a theory to investigate how geometrically frustrated clusters that become decorated affect the Cluster Spin Glass phase. The cluster structure is assumed to be a tetrahedron composed of Ising spins with z-anisotropy placed at its vertices that interact antiferromagnetically. We consider the probability $1-p_J$ of finding an impurity at a vertex of the tetrahedron that interacts ferromagnetically with the remaining elements inside the tetrahedron. An intercluster disorder is added as a random Gaussian interaction. The order parameters are obtained using the sparse random graph technique, which introduces the connectivity of the network of clusters as a controllable parameter in the theory. We examine changes that occur in the Cluster Spin Glass phase as a function of $p_J$ and $c$, in addition to the antiferromagnetic intracluster couplings $J_1$. For intermediate values of $p_J$, unexpected results appear. Even when some clusters contain a ferromagnetic impurity, there will still be robust geometric frustration effects in the cluster network. However, the $p_J$ threshold for this to occur depends on connectivity. Conversely, below this threshold, reduced GF effects favor the reappearance of the CSG phase. Furthermore, the Curie-Weiss temperature $\Theta_W$ has a gradual change of signal, indicating that the effects of the impurities extend to the paramagnetic phase.

Title: Transverse Self-Propulsion Enhances the Aggregation of Active Dumbbells
Authors: Pasquale Digregorio, Daniela Moretti, Claudio Basilio Caporusso, Lucio Mauro Carenza, Giuseppe Gonnella, Giuseppe Negro, Massimiliano Semeraro, Antonio Suma
Abstract: We investigate a two-dimensional system of active Brownian dumbbells using molecular dynamics simulations. In this model, each dumbbell is driven by an active force oriented perpendicular to the axis connecting its two constituent beads. We characterize the resulting phase behavior and find that, across all values of activity, the system undergoes phase separation between dilute and dense phases. The dense phase exhibits hexatic order, and for large enough activity, we observe a marked increase in local polarization, with dumbbells predominantly oriented towards the interior of the clusters. Compared to the case of axially self-propelled dumbbells, we find that the binodal region is enlarged towards lower densities at all activities. This shift arises because dumbbells with transverse propulsion can more easily form stable cluster cores, serving as nucleation seeds, and show a highly suppressed escaping rate from the cluster boundary. Finally, we observe that clusters exhibit spontaneous rotation, with the modulus of the angular velocity scaling as $\omega\sim r_g^{-2}$, where $r_g$ is the cluster's radius of gyration. This contrasts with axially propelled dumbbells, where the scaling follows $\omega\sim r_g^{-1}$. We develop a simplified analytical model to rationalize this scaling behavior.

Title: Floquet Theory of lattice electrons coupled to an off-resonant cavity
Authors: Jules Sueiro, Gian Marcello Andolina, Marco Schirò
Abstract: We use Floquet theory and the High-Frequency expansion to derive an effective Hamiltonian for electrons coupled to an off resonant cavity mode, either in its vacuum or driven by classical light. For vacuum fields, we show that long-range hopping and cavity-mediated interactions arise as a direct consequence of quantum fluctuations. As an application, this method is applied to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. At high light-matter coupling, our results reveal significant deviations from mean-field predictions, with our framework capturing light-matter entanglement through the Floquet micromotion. Furthermore, the cavity-mediated interactions appearing at first order are shown to be crucial to the description of the system at sufficiently strong light-matter coupling for a fixed cavity frequency. Finally, a drive resonant with the cavity is added with the SSH chain displaying dynamical behavior dependent on the cavity parameters.

Title: Coherence of dipole-forbidden Rydberg excitons in Cu$_2$O measured by polarization- and time-resolved multi-photon spectroscopy
Authors: A. Farenbruch, N. V. Siverin, G. Uca, D. Fröhlich, D. R. Yakovlev, M. Bayer
Abstract: Quantum applications of solid state systems base upon generation and control of coherent electronic excitations. Prominent examples are exciton states in semiconductors excitable by photons. The high oscillator strength of electric-dipole (ED) allowed exciton states favors their efficient coherent generation, but limits also their lifetime. ED-forbidden exciton states with long recombination times might maintain long-lived coherence, especially in highly-quality crystals with suppressed exciton scattering. Here, we propose a multi-photon technique combining two-photon excitation with difference frequency generation (2PE-DFG) for time-resolved measurements of exciton coherence. The technique utilizes polarization tomography for state-selective control in both the pump and probe processes. Its potential is demonstrated by measuring the coherent dynamics of the ED-forbidden $S$ and $D$ excitons in Cu$_2$O crystals. The excited states of the Rydberg excitons with principal quantum number $n=2$, $3$, and $4$ have short dephasing times of a few picoseconds, limited by their relaxation to lower lying states. The dephasing time reaches 3 ns for the $1S$ state. In an external magnetic field up to 10 T, the $1S$ exciton splits into a triplet so that quantum beats are observed after coherent excitation, for which three distinct regimes are found depending on the chosen polarization tomography scheme. These results establish the 2PE-DFG technique as a powerful tool to assess the coherent dynamics of ED-forbidden excitons.

Title: Phase-engineered Non-degenerate Sliding Ferroelectricity Enables Tunable Photovoltaics in Monolayer Janus In2S2Se
Authors: Yixuan Li, Qiang Wang, Keying Han, Yitong Liang, Kai Kong, Yan Liang, Thomas Frauenheimc, Xingshuai Lv, Defeng Guo, Bin Wang
Abstract: Two-dimensional sliding ferroelectrics, with their enhanced efficiencies of charge separation and tunability, constitute promising platforms for next-generation photovoltaic devices. However, recent systems predominantly exhibit dual degenerate polarization states with weak intensity, hindering the optimal manipulations of photovoltaic effects through sliding ferroelectricity. Here, we address this limitation by introducing two strengthened and distinct non-degenerate sliding ferroelectric phases (WZ' and ZB') in Janus In2S2Se, which can be achieved by Se-to-S substitution in monolayer In2Se3. First-principles calculations validate the experimental synthesis of this structure and its capability for reversible phase transitions triggered by atomic layer sliding, and a series of superior photovoltaic performances are demonstrated in such unique Janus In2S2Se, accompanied by a detailed analysis of how non-degenerate sliding ferroelectricity modulates distinct photovoltaic characteristics. The WZ' to ZB' transition can increase the carrier mobility and moderate the band gap while inducing an indirect-to-direct transition, yielding a marked red-shift and enhancement of the photocurrent peak in the infrared spectrum. Conversely, the WZ' phase, benefiting from enhanced polarization, delivers superior photoelectric conversion efficiency in the visible light region. This work establishes a phase-engineered framework of how non-degenerate sliding ferroelectricity orchestrates distinct photovoltaic behaviors, and the intrinsic physical correlations may offer novel perspectives for designing and regulating innovative photovoltaic devices.

Title: Nanoscale Modulation of Flat Bands via Controllable Charge-Density-Waves Defects in 4Hb-TaS2
Authors: Wooin Yang, Siavash Karbasizadeh, Hoyeon Jeon, Saban Hus, Arthur P. Baddorf, Sai Mu, Tom Berlijn, Haidong Zhou, Wonhee Ko, An-Ping Li
Abstract: Electron correlation is a main driver of exotic quantum phases and their interplay. The 4Hb-TaS2 system, possessing intrinsic heterostructure of 1T- and 1H-TaS2 monolayers, offers a unique opportunity to control electron correlation by distorting the atomic lattice or tuning interlayer coupling. Here, we investigated intrinsically deformed charge-density-waves (CDW) in the 1T layer of 4Hb-TaS2 to elucidate and control their effects on flat bands using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) combined with first-principles calculations. We identified two types of CDW defects: Type 1 has structural distortion and locally suppressed flat bands, while Type 2 features an increased flat band filling factor of intact CDW structure. Density functional theory calculations indicate that a sulfur vacancy in the 1T layer distorts the CDW structure and gives rise to a Type 1, whereas a sulfur vacancy in the 1H layer reduces the interlayer charge transfer and lead to a Type 2. Furthermore, we demonstrated creating and erasing individual CDW defects via STM manipulation. Our findings provide a pathway to not only tune flat bands but also selectively manipulate the interaction between CDW, the atomic lattice, and interlayer coupling in strongly correlated systems with atomic precision.

Title: The Effect of Pattern Quality on Measurements of Stress Heterogeneity and Geometrically Necessary Dislocation Density by High-Angular Resolution Electron Backscatter Diffraction
Authors: Harison S. Wiesman, David Wallis
Abstract: We examine the effect of pattern quality on the output of high-angular resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) analyses. Band contrast, as a proxy for pattern quality, was varied by adjusting the number of frames averaged per electron backscatter pattern during data collection. The same region in a deformed sample of the mineral olivine was mapped six times varying the number of frames averaged between 1 and 30 between each map. Each data set was analyzed with HR-EBSD, producing maps of intragranular stress heterogeneity and geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density. As the number of frames averaged increased, the noise in stress and GND calculations decreased, revealing more substructure in the mapped region. The worst pixels, with low band contrast, are the most improved by increased frame averaging, whereas those with high band contrast are largely unaffected. Additionally, the probability distribution of stresses narrows as high-stress noise is reduced with increased pattern quality, which also affects estimates of dislocation density from statistical analysis of the stress distributions. As regions with high stress and/or high GND density are typically of interest in HR-EBSD maps and are often associated with low band contrast, frame averaging may be used as a tool to improve the quality of these analyses. Most importantly, however, is that comparisons are made between HR-EBSD datasets with similar mean band contrast to ensure that observed differences are microstructural in origin and not an artefact of data collection.

Title: Doubling the magnetorheological effect of magnetic elastomers
Authors: Lukas Fischer, Andreas M. Menzel
Abstract: One of the most important properties of soft functionalized magnetic composite materials in view of their technological potential is given by the magnetorheological effect. It describes the change in rheological properties such as the shear modulus by application of external magnetic fields. We demonstrate how computational material design can support in approximately doubling the magnitude of this important phenomenon for magnetic elastomers. Key is to work with two perpendicular magnetic field directions. We expect future practical relevance of our concept.

Title: Revisiting the Fermion Sign Problem from the Structure of Lee-Yang Zeros. I. The Form of Partition Function for Indistinguishable Particles and Its Zeros at 0~K
Authors: Ran-Chen He, Jia-Xi Zeng, Shu Yang, Cong Wang, Qi-Jun Ye, Xin-Zheng Li
Abstract: To simulate indistinguishable particles, recent studies of path-integral molecular dynamics formulated their partition function $Z$ as a recurrence relation involving a variable $\xi$, with $\xi=1$(-1) for bosons (fermions). Inspired by Lee-Yang phase transition theory, we extend $\xi$ into the complex plane and reformulate $Z$ as a polynomial in $\xi$. By analyzing the distribution of the partition function zeros, we gain insights into the analytical properties of indistinguishable particles, particularly regarding the fermion sign problem (FSP). We found that at 0~K, the partition function zeros for $N$-particles are located at $\xi=-1$, $-1/2$, $-1/3$, $\cdots$, $-1/(N-1)$. This distribution disrupts the analytic continuation of thermodynamic quantities, expressed as functions of $\xi$ and typically performed along $\xi=1\to-1$, whenever the paths intersect these zeros. Moreover, we highlight the zero at $\xi = -1$, which induces an extra term in the free energy of the fermionic systems compared to ones at other $\xi=e^{i\theta}$ values. If a path connects this zero to a bosonic system with identical potential energies, it brings a transition resembling a phase transition. These findings provide a fresh perspective on the successes and challenges of emerging FSP studies based on analytic continuation techniques.

Title: Geometrical entanglement and alignment regulate self-organization in active ring polymer suspensions
Authors: Juan Pablo Miranda, Emanuele Locatelli, Cristian Micheletti, Demian Levis, Chantal Valeriani
Abstract: We study the emerging self-organization in active ring suspensions, focusing on how the rings' orientational order and geometric entanglement vary with density and spatial confinement. To quantify entanglement, we introduce the wrapping number, a pairwise measure of ring interpenetration, while orientational order is characterized by the alignment of the normal vectors to the rings' osculating planes. Both wrapping number and alignment distinguish active from passive systems, and their combination aptly identifies the self-organized states that emerge with the onset of activity. Mutual-information analysis reveals a significant correlation between alignment and wrapping number across all considered active conditions. However, self-organization displays a non-monotonic dependence on the activity-induced entanglement. Specifically, moderate wrapping stabilizes contacts of neighboring aligned rings, while excessive entanglement disrupts alignment. We show that this competition arises because increasing entanglement interferes with the planar conformations required to form aligned stacks. Given the simplicity of this microscopic mechanism, analogous effects may occur more generally in polymer systems where the degree of entanglement is regulated by out-of-equilibrium effects.

Title: Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks
Authors: F. Gallavotti, A. Zaccone
Abstract: We present a vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative memory model inspired by the theory of amorphous solids, where binary neural states are replaced by unit vectors $\mathbf{s}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ on the sphere $S^2$. The generalized Hebbian learning rule creates a block-structured weight matrix through outer products of stored pattern vectors, analogous to the Hessian matrix structure in amorphous solids. We demonstrate that this model exhibits quantifiable structural properties characteristic of disordered materials: energy landscapes with deep minima for stored patterns versus random configurations (energy gaps $\sim 7$ units), strongly anisotropic correlations encoded in the weight matrix (anisotropy ratios $\sim 10^2$), and order-disorder transitions controlled by the pattern density $\gamma = P/(N \cdot d)$. The enhanced memory capacity ($\gamma_c \approx 0.55$ for a fully-connected network) compared to binary networks ($\gamma_c \approx 0.138$) and the emergence of orientational correlations establish connections between associative memory mechanisms and amorphous solid physics, particularly in systems with continuous orientational degrees of freedom. We also unveil the scaling with the coordination number $Z$ of the memory capacity: $\gamma_c \sim (Z-6)$ from the isostatic point $Z_c =6$ of the 3D elastic network, which closely mirrors the scaling of the shear modulus $G \sim (Z-6)$ in 3D central-force spring networks.

Title: Enhanced Biaxial Compressive Strain Tuning of 2D semiconductors via Hot Dry Transfer on Polymer Substrates
Authors: Alvaro Cortes-Flores, Eudomar Henríquez-Guerra, Lisa Almonte, Hao Li, Andres Castellanos-Gomez, M. Reyes Calvo
Abstract: Strain engineering is an effective tool for tailoring the properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, especially for tuning quantum phenomena. Among the limited methods available for strain engineering under cryogenic conditions, thermal mismatch with polymeric substrates provides a simple and affordable strategy to induce biaxial compressive strain upon cooling. In this work, we demonstrate the transfer of unprecedentedly large levels of uniform biaxial compressive strain to single-layer WS$_2$ by employing a pre-straining approach prior to cryogenic cooling. Using a hot-dry-transfer method, single-layer WS$_2$ samples were deposited onto thermally expanded polymeric substrates at 100 $^\circ$C. As the substrate cools to room temperature, it contracts, inducing biaxial compressive strain (up to ~0.5%) in the WS$_2$ layer. This pre-strain results in a measurable blueshift in excitonic energies compared to samples transferred at room temperature, which serve as control (not pre-strained) samples. Subsequent cooling of the pre-strained samples from room temperature down to 5 K leads to a remarkable total blueshift of ~200 meV in the exciton energies of single-layer WS$_2$. This energy shift surpasses previously reported values, indicating superior levels of biaxial compressive strain induced by the accumulated substrate contraction of ~1.7%. Moreover, our findings reveal a pronounced temperature dependence in strain transfer efficiency, with gauge factors approaching theoretical limits for ideal strain transfer at 5 K. We attribute this enhanced efficiency to the increased Young's modulus of the polymeric substrate at cryogenic temperatures.

Title: High Entropy Engineering of Magnetic Kagome Lattice (Gd,Tb,Dy,Ho,Er)Mn6Sn6
Authors: Wenhao Liu, Nikhil Uday Dhale, Youzhe Chen, Pramanand Joshi, Zixin Zhai, Xiqu Wang, Ping Liu, Robert J. Birgeneau, Boris Maiorov, Christopher A. Mizzi, Bing Lv
Abstract: The magnetic kagome lattice compound RMn6Sn6 (R=rare earth) is an emerging platform to exploit the interplay between magnetism and topological electronic states where a variety of exciting findings such as flat bands, Dirac points as well as the dramatic dependence of magnetic order on the rare-earth element have been reported. High entropy through rare earth alloying, on the other hand, provides another knob to control over the physical properties in this system. Here, by the marriage of high entropy and the magnetic kagome lattice, we obtain (Gd,Tb,Dy,Ho,Er)Mn6Sn6 single crystals and systematically investigate their magnetic and transport properties. Different from the parent phases, the high entropy 166 material displays multiple novel magnetic transitions induced by temperature and external magnetic fields. Furthermore, linear magnetoresistance persisting up to 20 T has been revealed at 4 K. The intrinsic nontrivial band topology also survives in the high entropy form, as evidenced by the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Our results highlight high entropy as a powerful approach for tuning the interplay of charge, spin and lattice degree of freedom in magnetic topological materials.

Title: Dipolar optimal control of quantum states
Authors: Héctor Briongos-Merino, Felipe Isaule, Bruno Juliá-Díaz, Montserrat Guilleumas
Abstract: Quantum state control is a fundamental tool for quantum technologies. In this work, we propose and analyze the use of quantum optimal control that exploits the dipolar interaction of ultracold atoms on a lattice ring, focusing on the generation of selected states with entangled circulation. This scheme requires time-dependent control over the orientation of the magnetic field, a technique that is feasible in ultracold atom laboratories. The system's evolution is driven by just two independent control functions. We describe the symmetry constraints and other requirements of this approach, and numerically test them using the extended Bose-Hubbard model. We find that the proposed control can engineer entangled current states with perfect fidelity across a wide range of systems, and that in the remaining cases, the theoretical upper bounds for fidelity are reached.

Title: Revealing Nanoscale Ni-Oxidation State Variations in Single-Crystal NMC811 via 2D and 3D Spectro-Ptychography
Authors: Ralf F. Ziesche, Michael J. Johnson, Ingo Manke, Joshua H. Cruddos, Alice V. Llewellyn, Chun Tan, Rhodri Jervis, Paul R. Shearing, Christoph Rau, Alexander J. E. Rettie, Silvia Cipiccia, Darren Batey
Abstract: Enabling lithium (Li)-ion batteries with higher energy densities, longer cycle life, and lower costs will underpin the widespread electrification of the transportation and large-scale energy storage industries. Nickel (Ni)-rich layered oxide cathodes, such as LiNi$_{x}$Mn$_{y}$Co$_{z}$O$_{2}$ (NMC, x > 0.8), have gained popularity due to their high specific capacities and lower cobalt content. However, the standard polycrystalline morphology suffers from accelerated degradation at voltages above 4.2 V versus graphite, due to its increased mechanical and chemical instability. Single-crystal NMC (SC-NMC) has emerged as a promising morphology for suppressing the mechanical instability by preventing intergranular cracking; however, robust methods of understanding its chemical degradation pathways are required. We demonstrate how a high-throughput data collection strategy unlocks the ability to perform 2D and 3D ptychography in minutes, where it currently requires hours, and combine this with X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) to visualise the local Ni oxidation state behaviour in SC-NMC811, with nanometre-scale spatial resolution, and use this as a proxy for state-of-charge. By employing this technique at various stages during lifetime cycling to high voltages (>4.2 V), direct mapping of chemical degradation along the Li channels, identification of nucleation sites, and observation of Ni oxidation state heterogeneities across both electrode and particle scales can be achieved. We further correlate these heterogeneities with the formation and growth of the rocksalt phase and oxygen-induced planar gliding. This methodology will advance the fundamental understanding of how high-Ni layered oxide materials chemically degrade during high-voltage operation, guiding the design of more durable battery materials.

Title: Complex topologies in phase separated droplets predicted from universal phase diagram
Authors: Amit Kumar, Gary H. Karpen, Samuel A. Safran
Abstract: Phase separation of two phase separating solutes in a common solvent can result in mesoscale (micron-sized) droplets with complex topologies of the domains of each solute within each droplet. Such topologies have been observed in-vitro in systems of chromatin oligomers, biomolecular condensates, and polymeric mixtures. In these systems the solutes phase separate from the solvent into droplets due to the relatively large free energy gain, which includes the energies and entropies of mixing with the solvent. Within each droplet, further phase separation can occur between the two solutes due to an additional free energy difference that promotes their demixing; in some systems, the extent of demixing can be, in some cases, be modulated by an additional component. The minimal free energy topologies are predicted as universal functions of the interfacial tension ratios and fractions of each solute within a droplet. We compare the predictions with several experimental systems to estimate the ranges of interfacial tensions. Experimental aspects that may depend on the kinetics or molecular weight variations in the system are also discussed.

Title: Non-periodic Boundary Conditions for Euler Class and Dynamical Signatures of Obstruction
Authors: Osama A. Alsaiari, Adrien Bouhon, Robert-Jan Slager, F. Nur Ünal
Abstract: While the landscape of free-fermion phases has drastically been expanded in the last decades, recently novel multi-gap topological phases were proposed where groups of bands can acquire new invariants such as Euler class. As in conventional single-gap topologies, obstruction plays an inherent role that so far has only been incidentally addressed. We here systematically investigate the nuances of the relation between the non-Bravais lattice configurations and the Brillouin zone boundary conditions (BZBCs) for any number of dimensions. Clarifying the nomenclature, we provide a general periodictization recipe to obtain a gauge with an almost Brillouin-zone-periodic Bloch Hamiltonian both generally and upon imposing a reality condition on Hamiltonians for Euler class. Focusing on three-band $\mathcal{C}_2$ symmetric Euler systems in two dimensions as a guiding example, we present a procedure to enumerate the possible lattice configurations, and thus the unique BZBCs possibilities. We establish a comprehensive classification for the identified BZBC patterns according to the parity constraints they impose on the Euler invariant, highlighting how it extends to more bands and higher dimensions. Moreover, by building upon previous work utilizing Hopf maps, we illustrate physical consequences of non-trivial BZBCs in the quench dynamics of non-Bravais lattice Euler systems, reflecting the parity of the Euler invariant. We numerically confirm our results and corresponding observable signatures, and discuss possible experimental implementations. Our work presents a general framework to study the role of non-trivial boundary conditions and obstructions on multi-gap topology that can be employed for arbitrary number bands or in higher dimensions.

Title: Floquet Spin Splitting and Spin Generation in Antiferromagnets
Authors: Bo Li, Ding-Fu Shao, Alexey A. Kovalev
Abstract: In antiferromagnetic spintronics, accessing the spin degree of freedom is essential for generating spin currents and manipulating magnetic order, which generally requires lifting spin degeneracy. This is typically achieved through relativistic spin-orbit coupling or non-relativistic spin splitting in altermagnets. Here, we propose an alternative approach: a dynamical spin splitting induced by an optical field in antiferromagnets. By coupling the driven system to a thermal bath, we demonstrate the emergence of steady-state pure spin currents, as well as linear-response longitudinal and transverse spin currents. Crucially, thermal bath engineering allows the generation of a net spin accumulation without relying on spin-orbit coupling. Our results provide a broadly applicable and experimentally tunable route to control spins in antiferromagnets, offering new opportunities for spin generation and manipulation in antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Title: Anyon Condensation in Virasoro TQFT: Wormhole Factorization
Authors: Shunta Takahashi
Abstract: Anyon condensation in wormhole geometries is investigated in the Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) formulation. We first review some elementary techniques of VTQFT and verify its consistency by showing that it reproduces semiclassical results, including the Hawking-Page phase transition and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of BTZ blackhole. We then summarize a gauging scheme for non-invertible symmetries referred to as anyon condensation and exhibit that it is applicable to VTQFT even though the category of Wilson lines associated with it is not strictly a modular tensor category (MTC). More specifically, it is shown that the partition function of the wormhole factorizes upon condensating the so-called diagonal condensable anyon in VTQFT.

Title: Quantum generative modeling for financial time series with temporal correlations
Authors: David Dechant, Eliot Schwander, Lucas van Drooge, Charles Moussa, Diego Garlaschelli, Vedran Dunjko, Jordi Tura
Abstract: Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) have been investigated as a method for generating synthetic data with the goal of augmenting training data sets for neural networks. This is especially relevant for financial time series, since we only ever observe one realization of the process, namely the historical evolution of the market, which is further limited by data availability and the age of the market. However, for classical generative adversarial networks it has been shown that generated data may (often) not exhibit desired properties (also called stylized facts), such as matching a certain distribution or showing specific temporal correlations. Here, we investigate whether quantum correlations in quantum inspired models of QGANs can help in the generation of financial time series. We train QGANs, composed of a quantum generator and a classical discriminator, and investigate two approaches for simulating the quantum generator: a full simulation of the quantum circuits, and an approximate simulation using tensor network methods. We tested how the choice of hyperparameters, such as the circuit depth and bond dimensions, influenced the quality of the generated time series. The QGAN that we trained generate synthetic financial time series that not only match the target distribution but also exhibit the desired temporal correlations, with the quality of each property depending on the hyperparameters and simulation method.

Title: Biomimetic Engineering of a Fortified Ice Composite with Enhanced Mechanical Properties
Authors: Chen Adar, Yulia Baron, Baruch Rofman, Maya Bar-Dolev, Liat Bahari, Victor Yashunsky, Vera Sirotinskaya, Oded Shoseyov, Ido Braslavsky
Abstract: This work presents BioPykrete, a new sustainable bio-composite material created from ice, nano-crystalline cellulose (CNC), and a tailor-made chimera protein designed to bind the two together. We developed and produced the chimera protein by linking AFPIII, an ice-binding protein, with CBM3a, a CNC-binding protein. As the suspension freezes, the CNC chains self-organize into a reinforcing network between the ice crystals. This structural enhancement limits crack propagation to typical pore sizes, allowing BioPykrete to avoid the brittle and sudden failure commonly associated with ice. Instead, it exhibits an elastic-like response to stress, making it suitable for construction and engineering applications. With compressive strength comparable with concrete, BioPykrete offers a sustainable and biodegradable alternative to construction materials suitable for the harsh arctic regions of the world where traditional methods are ineffective, and resources are scarce. Engineering chimera proteins with specific affinity to more than a single material type may help improve or tailor the properties of other composite materials.

Title: Phase-field modelling of cohesive fracture. Part III: From mathematical results to engineering application
Authors: Roberto Alessi, Francesco Colasanto, Matteo Focardi
Abstract: This paper concludes a three-part effort aimed at developing a consistent and unified framework for the phase-field modeling of cohesive fracture. Building on the theoretical foundations established in the first two parts, which included a $\Gamma$-convergence result for a broad class of phase-field energy functionals and the presentation of a rigorous analytical methodology for constructing models tailored to specific cohesive laws, this third paper explores the mechanical response of phase-field models, most of which are novel, associated with different cohesive fracture behaviors within a one-dimensional framework. Particular emphasis is placed on the possibility of formulating distinct phase-field models that, despite exhibiting different evolutions of their phase-field and displacement profiles, yield identical cohesive fracture responses. Thus, this work aims at providing a practical interpretation of the mathematical framework connecting the theoretical insights established in the previous parts for physical relevant applications.

Title: Multi-fidelity Bayesian Data-Driven Design of Energy Absorbing Spinodoid Cellular Structures
Authors: Leo Guo, Hirak Kansara, Siamak F. Khosroshahi, GuoQi Zhang, Wei Tan
Abstract: Finite element (FE) simulations of structures and materials are getting increasingly more accurate, but also more computationally expensive as a collateral result. This development happens in parallel with a growing demand of data-driven design. To reconcile the two, a robust and data-efficient optimization method called Bayesian optimization (BO) has been previously established as a technique to optimize expensive objective functions. In parallel, the mesh width of an FE model can be exploited to evaluate an objective at a lower or higher fidelity (cost & accuracy) level. The multi-fidelity setting applied to BO, called multi-fidelity BO (MFBO), has also seen previous success. However, BO and MFBO have not seen a direct comparison with when faced with with a real-life engineering problem, such as metamaterial design for deformation and absorption qualities. Moreover, sampling quality and assessing design parameter sensitivity is often an underrepresented part of data-driven design. This paper aims to address these shortcomings by employing Sobol' samples with variance-based sensitivity analysis in order to reduce design problem complexity. Furthermore, this work describes, implements, applies and compares the performance BO with that MFBO when maximizing the energy absorption (EA) problem of spinodoid cellular structures is concerned. The findings show that MFBO is an effective way to maximize the EA of a spinodoid structure and is able to outperform BO by up to 11% across various hyperparameter settings. The results, which are made open-source, serve to support the utility of multi-fidelity techniques across expensive data-driven design problems.

Title: Protected quantum gates using qubit doublons in dynamical optical lattices
Authors: Yann Kiefer, Zijie Zhu, Lars Fischer, Samuel Jele, Marius Gächter, Giacomo Bisson, Konrad Viebahn, Tilman Esslinger
Abstract: Quantum computing represents a central challenge in modern science. Neutral atoms in optical lattices have emerged as a leading computing platform, with collisional gates offering a stable mechanism for quantum logic. However, previous experiments have treated ultracold collisions as a dynamically fine-tuned process, which obscures the underlying quantum- geometry and statistics crucial for realising intrinsically robust operations. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a purely geometric two-qubit swap gate by transiently populating qubit doublon states of fermionic atoms in a dynamical optical lattice. The presence of these doublon states, together with fermionic exchange anti-symmetry, enables a two-particle quantum holonomy -- a geometric evolution where dynamical phases are absent. This yields a gate mechanism that is intrinsically protected against fluctuations and inhomogeneities of the confining potentials. The resilience of the gate is further reinforced by time-reversal and chiral symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We experimentally validate this exceptional protection, achieving a loss-corrected amplitude fidelity of $99.91(7)\%$ measured across the entire system consisting of more than $17'000$ atom pairs. When combined with recently developed topological pumping methods for atom transport, our results pave the way for large-scale, highly connected quantum processors. This work introduces a new paradigm for quantum logic, transforming fundamental symmetries and quantum statistics into a powerful resource for fault-tolerant computation.

Title: Quantum complexity phase transition in fermionic quantum circuits
Authors: Wei Xia, Yijia Zhou, Xingze Qiu, Xiaopeng Li
Abstract: Understanding the complexity of quantum many-body systems has been attracting much attention recently for its fundamental importance in characterizing complex quantum phases beyond the scope of quantum entanglement. Here, we investigate Krylov complexity in quantum percolation models (QPM) and establish unconventional phase transitions emergent from the interplay of exponential scaling of the Krylov complexity and the number of spanning clusters in QPM. We develop a general scaling theory for Krylov complexity phase transitions (KCPT) on QPM, and obtain exact results for the critical probabilities and exponents. For non-interacting systems across diverse lattices (1D/2D/3D regular, Bethe, and quasicrystals), our scaling theory reveals that the KCPT coincides with the classical percolation transition. In contrast, for interacting systems, we find the KCPT develops a generic separation from the percolation transition due to the highly complex quantum many-body effects, which is analogous to the Griffiths effect in the critical disorder phase transition. To test our theoretical predictions, we provide a concrete protocol for measuring the Krylov complexity, which is accessible to present experiments.

Title: Fragmented exceptional points and their bulk and edge realizations in lattice models
Authors: Subhajyoti Bid, Henning Schomerus
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are spectral defects displayed by non-Hermitian systems in which multiple degenerate eigenvalues share a single eigenvector. This distinctive feature makes systems exhibiting EPs more sensitive to external perturbations than their Hermitian counterparts, where degeneracies are nondefective diabolic points. In contrast to these widely studied cases, more complex non-Hermitian degeneracies in which the eigenvectors are only partially degenerate are poorly understood. Here, we characterize these fragmented exceptional points (FEPs) systematically from a physical perspective, and demonstrate how they can be induced into the bulk and edge spectrum of two-dimensional and three-dimensional lattice models, exemplified by non-Hermitian versions of a Lieb lattice and a higher-order topological Dirac semimetal. The design of the systems is facilitated by an efficient algebraic approach within which we provide precise conditions for FEPs that can be evaluated directly from a given model Hamiltonian. The free design of FEPs significantly opens up a new frontier for non-Hermitian physics and expands the scope for designing systems with unconventional response characteristics.

Title: What the Boltzmann money game teaches us about statistical mechanics (and maybe economics)
Authors: Dmitrii E. Makarov
Abstract: This note explains why a large class of fair, or reversible "money games", i.e., stochastic models of wealth redistribution among agents, lead to steady states described by canonical and microcanonical distributions. The games considered include, for example, ones where more than two agents can be simultaneously involved in money transfers (similarly to many-body collisions in chemical kinetics) and where amounts transferred between agents are random. At the same time, money games that break time reversal symmetry can also lead to the canonical/microcanonical distributions, as illustrated by an explicit example.

Title: Complexity in multiqubit and many-body systems
Authors: Imre Varga
Abstract: The complexity of $n$-qubit and many body systems is investigated. In case of an $n$-qubit system the disturbance due to depolarization and dephasing is identified based on a certain complexity quantity defined as the difference of the Shannon-entropy and the Rényi entropy of order two. In case of the effect of the depolarization the quantum system is replaced by a fully separable, i.e. classical state with probability $p$ while it remains unchanged with probability $1-p$. Whereas dephasing is modelled by destructing the appropriate off-diagonal elements of the density matrix also with probability $p$. For both cases the state with maximal complexity marks the border between the most quantum and most classical limits. Furthermore we also show that many body systems modelled using deformed random matrix ensembles, deformed two-body random interaction ensembles and also the system of one-dimensional Heisenberg-model of spins subject to a random, local magnetic field exhibiting many body localization transition, the states with maximal complexity mark the cross-over or the transition point between integrability and full quantum chaos. Finally we address the question of identifying the cross-over in the thermalization properties within large sets of quantum chaotic states using the survival probability of an excitation of a many body system. All these results show that the complexity parameter defined on a combination of the von Neumann entropy and the Rényi entropy of 2nd order is a meaningful and informative parameter to detect whenever a system is in a cross-over state between the otherwise trivial extremal cases of integrability or localization and quantum chaos or ergodic behavior.

Title: Opinion formation in Wikipedia Ising networks
Authors: Leonardo Ermann, Klaus M. Frahm, Dima L. Shepelyansky
Abstract: We study properties of opinion formation on Wikipedia Ising Networks. Each Wikipedia article is represented as a node and links are formed by citations of one article to another generating a directed network of a given language edition with millions of nodes. Ising spins are placed at each node and their orientation up or down is determined by a majority vote of connected neighbors. At the initial stage there are only a few nodes from two groups with fixed competing opinions up and down while other nodes are assumed to have no initial opinion with no effect on the vote. The competition of two opinions is modeled by an asynchronous Monte Carlo process converging to a spin polarized steady-state phase. This phase remains stable with respect to small fluctuations induced by an effective temperature of the Monte Carlo process. The opinion polarization at the steady-state provides opinion (spin) preferences for each node. In the framework of this Ising Network Opinion Formation model we analyze the influence and competition between political leaders, world countries and social concepts. This approach is also generalized to the competition between three groups of different opinions described by three colors, for example Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA, Russia, China within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of March 2025. We argue that this approach provides a generic description of opinion formation in various complex networks.

Title: Characterizing Material Effects On Direct ToF Signal Response In Optical Tactile Systems

Abstract: Optical tactile sensing holds transformative potential for robotics, particularly in collaborative environments where touch perception enhances safety, adaptability, and cognitive interaction. However, traditional tactile technologies based on total internal reflection (TIR) and frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) - such as those used in touchscreen systems - face significant limitations. These include reliance on multiple infrared light sources and cameras, as well as poor adaptability to the complex, curved geometries often found in robotic systems. To address these challenges, we recently introduced OptoSkin, an advanced optical tactile sensor based on direct Time-of-Flight (ToF) technology, enabling touch and pressure detection. In this study, we investigate how specific material properties, particularly light scattering, influence the sensitivity of contact point detection under direct ToF sensing. Four materials with distinct scattering coefficients were selected to assess their impact on signal quality across different contact scenarios involving various target surfaces.

Title: Two-Dimensional Bialgebras and Quantum Groups: Algebraic Structures and Tensor Network Realizations
Authors: José Garre-Rubio, András Molnár, Germán Sierra
Abstract: We introduce a framework to define coalgebra and bialgebra structures on two-dimensional (2D) square lattices, extending the algebraic theory of Hopf algebras and quantum groups beyond the one-dimensional (1D) setting. Our construction is based on defining 2D coproducts through horizontal and vertical maps that satisfy compatibility and associativity conditions, enabling the consistent growth of vector spaces over lattice sites. We present several examples of 2D bialgebras, including group-like and Lie algebra-inspired constructions and a quasi-1D coproduct instance that is applicable to Taft-Hopf algebras and to quantum groups. The approach is further applied to the quantum group $U_q[su(2)]$, for which we construct 2D generalizations of its generators, analyze $q$-deformed singlet states, and derive a 2D R-matrix satisfying an intertwining relation in the semiclassical limit. Additionally, we show how tensor network states, particularly PEPS, naturally induce 2D coalgebra structures when supplemented with appropriate boundary conditions. Our results establish a local and algebraically consistent method to embed quantum group symmetries into higher-dimensional lattice systems, potentially connecting to the emerging theory of fusion 2-categories and categorical symmetries in quantum many-body physics.

Title: Non-Hermitian Quantum Many-Body Scar Phase
Authors: Keita Omiya, Yuya O Nakagawa
Abstract: We introduce a novel non-equilibrium phase -- the quantum many-body scar (QMBS) phase -- that emerges in non-Hermitian many-body dynamics when scarred wavefunctions are selectively stabilized via non-Hermitian driving. Projective measurements, or non-Hermitian counterparts, preferentially reinforce QMBS, counteracting the entropy growth that drives thermalization. As a result, atypical, high-energy scarred wavefunctions that are negligible in the long-time dynamics of closed systems become non-equilibrium steady states. We establish the existence of the QMBS phase and its sharp, first-order phase transition from an ergodic thermal phase, through both analytical arguments and numerical simulations of three representative models: a random quantum circuit model, the $SU(q)$ spin model, and the paradigmatic spin-1 XY model.

Title: Anomalous dimensions and critical exponents for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model at five loops
Authors: J.A. Gracey, A. Maier, P. Marquard, Y. Schröder
Abstract: We renormalize the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model with an $O(N)$ symmetry to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^5)$ in $d=4-\epsilon$ dimensions and determine the anomalous dimensions of the fermion and scalar fields, $\beta$-functions as well as the scalar field's mass operator. These are used to construct several $N$ dependent critical exponents relevant for quantum transitions in semi-metals and in particular those connected with graphene in three dimensions when $N=2$. Improved exponent estimates for scalar fermion transitions on a honeycomb lattice, when $N=1$, as well as for $N=5$ are also given to compare with results from other techniques such as the conformal bootstrap.

Title: Optically Actuated Transitions in Multimodal, Bistable Micromechanical Oscillators
Authors: Lior Michaeli, Ramon Gao, Michael D. Kelzenberg, Claudio U. Hail, John E. Sader, Harry A. Atwater
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a new class of optomechanical nonlinearities in weakly damped micromechanical resonators, arising from the interplay between the Duffing nonlinearity, intermodal coupling, and thermal fluctuations. Within the bistable regime of a single Duffing mode driven by radiation pressure forces, we observe stochastically generated sidebands, originating from thermal fluctuations around equilibrium trajectories in phase space, and exploit these sidebands to induce probabilistic transitions between bistable states using weak secondary acoustic excitation. Extending this framework to multimodal interactions, we show that nonlinear modes coupling within the same resonator leads to similar transitions due to parametric modulation around the noise-excited sidebands as a result of frequency mixing. Simultaneously, abrupt changes in displacements of modes cause their instantaneous energy exchange rates to span five orders of magnitude. These findings open new avenues for reconfigurable optomechanical networks, nonreciprocal energy transport, and precision sensing based on dynamically tunable mechanical nonlinearities.

Title: Quantitative Benchmarking of Remote Excitation in Plasmonic Sensing with Enhanced Signal-to-Noise Ratio
Authors: Tao He, Haoran Liu, Zihe Jiang, Zhiwei Hu, Banghuan Zhang, Xiaohui Dong, Chaowei Sun, Wei Jiang, Jiawei Sun, Yang Li, Huatian Hu, Wen Chen, Hongxing Xu
Abstract: Remote excitation using guided optical modes -- such as waveguides, fibers, or surface waves -- offers a promising alternative to direct optical excitation for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), particularly in applications requiring reduced heating, minimal invasiveness, and on-chip integration. However, despite its widespread use, systematic comparisons between remote and direct excitation remain limited. Here, we quantitatively benchmark both schemes by measuring power-dependent SERS responses from individual plasmonic nanogaps. We statistically analyze the maximum achievable SERS intensity before structural degradation, extract local temperatures, and evaluate signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Our findings reveal that both remote and direct SERS share a common electric-field limit, despite exhibiting different levels of heating. This suggests that spectral evolution is primarily governed by the local electric field, which drives nanoscale atomic migration rather than excessive heating. Nonetheless, the lower heating associated with remote excitation enhances the Raman SNR by approximately 30%, improving measurement quality without compromising signal strength. This study establishes a quantitative framework for evaluating excitation strategies in plasmonic sensing, and challenges common assumptions about the role of heating in nanostructural stability under strong optical excitation.

Title: 2D CFT and efficient Bethe ansatz for exactly solvable Richardson-Gaudin models
Authors: Grzegorz Biskowski, Franco Ferrari, Marcin R. Piatek
Abstract: This work inaugurates a series of complementary studies on Richardson-Gaudin integrable models. We begin by reviewing the foundations of classical and quantum integrability, recalling the algebraic Bethe ansatz solution of the Richardson (reduced BCS) and Gaudin (central spin) models, and presenting a proof of their integrability based on the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and their generalizations to perturbed affine conformal blocks. Building on this foundation, we then describe an alternative CFT-based formulation. In this approach, the Bethe ansatz equations for these exactly solvable models are embedded within two-dimensional Virasoro CFT via irregular, degenerate conformal blocks. To probe new formulations within the Richardson-Gaudin class, we develop a high-performance numerical solver. The Bethe roots are encoded in the Baxter polynomial, with initial estimates obtained from a secular matrix eigenproblem and subsequently refined using a deflation-assisted hybrid Newton-Raphson/Laguerre algorithm. The solver proves effective in practical applications: when applied to picket-fence, harmonic oscillator, and hydrogen-like spectra, it accurately reproduces known rapidity trajectories and reveals consistent merging and branching patterns of arcs in the complex rapidity plane. We also explain how to generalize our computational approach to finite temperatures, allowing us to calculate temperature-dependent pairing energies and other thermodynamic observables directly within the discrete Richardson model. We propose an application of the solver to Gaudin-type Bethe equations, which emerge in the classical (large central charge) limit of Virasoro conformal blocks. We conclude by outlining future directions: direct minimization of the Yang-Yang function as an alternative root-finding strategy; revisiting time-dependent extensions; and ... .

Title: Matrix product states as thin torus limits of conformal correlators
Authors: Adrián Franco-Rubio, J. Ignacio Cirac, Germán Sierra
Abstract: We introduce one-parameter families of spin chain ansatz wavefunctions constructed from chiral conformal field theory correlators on a torus, with the modular parameter $\tau$ serving as the deformation parameter. In the cylinder limit $\tau\to\infty$, these wavefunctions reduce to infinite dimensional matrix product states. In contrast, in the thin torus limit $\tau\to0$, they become finite bond dimension matrix product states (MPS). Focusing on families derived from the SU(2)$_1$ and SU(2)$_2$ Wess-Zumino-Witten models, we show that in the thin torus limit they reproduce known MPS ground states, such as those of the Majumdar-Ghosh and AKLT spin chains.

Title: On the efficiency roll-off in Perovskite Light Emitting Diodes
Authors: Pradeep R Nair, Advaith Kiran Marathi
Abstract: Here, we report a comprehensive modeling framework to unravel the efficiency roll-off in Perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Our model self-consistently accounts for a positive feedback mechanism which involves diverse phenomena like temperature-dependent carrier recombination, space charge effects, Joule heating, and thermal transport. Model predictions compare well with experimental results such as dark current-voltage characteristics and efficiency as well as radiance roll-off under high injection conditions. This work identifies key performance limiting phenomena in current state-of-the-art PeLEDs and could be of broad relevance towards device optimization, thermal design, packaging, and operational lifetime.

Abstract: We show that Yb(trensal) molecular nanomagnet, embedding an electronic spin qubit coupled to a nuclear spin qudit, provides an ideal platform to probe entanglement in a qubit-qudit this http URL is demonstrated by developing an optimized pulse sequence to show violation of generalized Bell inequalities and by performing realistic numerical simulations including experimentally measured decoherence. We find that the inequalities are safely violated in a wide range of parameters, proving the robustness of entanglement in the investigated system. Furthermore, we propose a scheme to study qudit-qudit entanglement on a molecular spin trimer, in which two spins 3/2 are linked via an interposed switch to turn on and off their mutual interaction.

Title: Genuine multipartite entanglement as a probe of many-body localization in disordered spin chains with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions
Authors: Triyas Sapui, Keshav Das Agarwal, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: We demonstrate that the quenched average genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) can approach its maximum value in the ergodic phase of a disordered quantum spin model. In contrast, GME vanishes in the many-body localized (MBL) phase, both in equilibrium and in the long-time dynamical steady state, indicating a lack of useful entanglement in the localized regime. To establish this, we analyze the disordered Heisenberg spin chain subjected to a random magnetic field and incorporating two- and three-body Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. We exhibit that the behavior of GME, in both static eigenstates and in dynamically evolved states from an initial Neel configuration, serves as a reliable indicator of the critical disorder strength required for the ergodic-to-MBL transition. The identified transition point aligns well with standard indicators such as the gap ratio and correlation length. Moreover, we find that the presence of DM interactions, particularly the three-body one, significantly stabilizes the thermal phase and delays the onset of localization. This shift in the transition point is consistently reflected in both static and dynamical analyses, reinforcing GME as a robust probe for MBL transitions.

Title: Non-classicality at equilibrium and efficient predictions under non-commuting charges
Authors: Lodovico Scarpa, Nishan Ranabhat, Amit Te'eni, Abdulla Alhajri, Vlatko Vedral, Fabio Anza, Luis Pedro García-Pintos
Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system can conserve non-commuting observables, but the consequences of this phenomenon on relaxation are still not fully understood. We investigate this problem by leveraging an observable-dependent approach to equilibration and thermalization in isolated quantum systems. We extend such approach to scenarios with non-commuting charges, and show that it can accurately estimate the equilibrium distribution of coarse observables without access to the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Our predictions do not require weak coupling and are not restricted to local observables, thus providing an advantage over the non-Abelian thermal state. Within this approach, weak values and quasiprobability distributions emerge naturally and play a crucial role in characterizing the equilibrium distributions of observables. We show and numerically confirm that, due to charges' non-commutativity, these weak values can be anomalous even at equilibrium, which has been proven to be a proxy for non-classicality. Our work thus uncovers a novel connection between the relaxation of observables under non-commuting charges, weak values, and Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distributions.

Title: Boundary conditions dependence of the phase transition in the quantum Newman-Moore model
Authors: Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Luke Causer, Jamie F. Mair, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We study the triangular plaquette model (TPM, also known as the Newman-Moore model) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field on a lattice with periodic boundaries in both spatial dimensions. We consider specifically the approach to the ground state phase transition of this quantum TPM (QTPM, or quantum Newman-Moore model) as a function of the system size and type of boundary conditions. Using cellular automata methods, we obtain a full characterization of the minimum energy configurations of the TPM for arbitrary tori sizes. For the QTPM, we use these cycle patterns to obtain the symmetries of the model, which we argue determine its quantum phase transition: we find it to be a first-order phase transition, with the addition of spontaneous symmetry breaking for system sizes which have degenerate classical ground states. For sizes accessible to numerics, we also find that this classification is consistent with exact diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Quantum Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Unsupervised learning of representative local atomic arrangements in molecular dynamics data
Authors: Fabrice Roncoroni, Ana Sanz-Matias, Siddharth Sundararaman, David Prendergast
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations present a data-mining challenge, given that they can generate a considerable amount of data but often rely on limited or biased human interpretation to examine their information content. By not asking the right questions of MD data we may miss critical information hidden within it. We combine dimensionality reduction (UMAP) and unsupervised hierarchical clustering (HDBSCAN) to quantitatively characterize prevalent coordination environments of chemical species within MD data. By focusing on local coordination, we significantly reduce the amount of data to be analyzed by extracting all distinct molecular formulas within a given coordination sphere. We then efficiently combine UMAP and HDBSCAN with alignment or shape-matching algorithms to partition these formulas into structural isomer families indicating their relative populations. The method was employed to reveal details of cation coordination in electrolytes based on molecular liquids.

Title: Cellular automata in $d$ dimensions and ground states of spin models in $(d+1)$ dimensions
Authors: Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Luke Causer, Jamie F. Mair, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We show how the trajectories of $d$-dimensional cellular automata (CA) can be used to determine the ground states of $(d+1)$-dimensional classical spin models, and we characterise their quantum phase transition, when in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. For each of the 256 one-dimensional elementary CA we explicitly construct the simplest local two-dimensional classical spin model associated to the given CA, and we also describe this method for $d>1$ through selected examples. We illustrate our general observations with detailed studies of: (i) the $d=1$ CA Rule 150 and its $d=2$ four-body plaquette spin model, (ii) the $d=2$ CA whose associated model is the $d=3$ square-pyramid plaquette model, and (iii) two counter-propagating $d=1$ Rule 60 CA that correspond to the two-dimensional Baxter-Wu spin model. For the quantum spin models, we show that the connection to CAs implies a sensitivity on the approach to the thermodynamic limit via finite size scaling for their quantum phase transitions.

Title: Miscibility-Immiscibility transition of strongly interacting bosonic mixtures in optical lattices
Authors: Rukmani Bai, Soumik Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: Interaction plays key role in the mixing properties of a multi-component system. The miscibility-immiscibility transition (MIT) in a weakly interacting mixture of Bose gases is predominantly determined by the strengths of the intra and inter-component two-body contact interactions. On the other hand, in the strongly interacting regime interaction induced processes become relevant. Despite previous studies on bosonic mixtures in optical lattices, the effects of the interaction induced processes on the MIT remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the MIT in the strongly interacting phases of two-component bosonic mixture trapped in a homogeneous two-dimensional square optical lattice. Particularly we examine the MIT condition when both the components are in superfluid (SF), one-body staggered superfluid (OSSF), or supersolid (SS) phases. Our study uncovers that MIT condition is significantly shaped by the interplay of competing non-local intra- and inter-component density-induced tunneling effects, as well as off-site interactions. Notably, we demonstrate that the MIT condition for the staggered superfluid phase exhibits an inequality that is inverted compared to the conventional MIT condition associated with superfluid or supersolid phases driven by local contact interactions. In addition, we present the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard Model incorporating non-local processes, derived using a site-decoupling mean-field approach with the Gutzwiller ansatz. Our study contributes to the better understanding of miscibility properties of multi-component systems in the strongly interacting regime.

Title: Finite-frequency conductivity of nonlinear Luttinger liquid in smooth random potential
Authors: A. A. Dontsov, D. N. Aristov, A. P. Dmitriev
Abstract: We analyze the uniform conductivity of a one dimensional degenerate fermion system placed in a random disorder potential so smooth that backward scattering can be neglected. We use the nonlinear Luttinger liquid model to consider effects of both interaction and the curvature of fermionic dispersion. The finite frequency conductivity, calculated in the lowest order of disorder potential, consists of two parts. First one is the elastic contribution, largely independent of temperature and interaction. Second one is the inelastic contribution, strongly dependent on temperature and frequency and appearing upon simultaneous presence of curvature, disorder and interaction. We argue that apart from such finite frequency conductivity, there should always remain the delta function peak of conductivity at zero frequency, whose weight is weakly dependent on the disorder.

Title: Biologically relevant finite-size effects in a driven lattice gas with particle pausing and dynamical defects
Authors: Johannes Keisers, Lorenzo Vito Dal Zovo, Norbert Kern, Luca Ciandrini
Abstract: In this article we present a comprehensive study of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with pausing particles (pTASEP), a model initially introduced to describe RNAP dynamics during transcription. We extend previous mean-field approaches and demonstrate that the pTASEP is equivalent to the exclusion process with dynamical defects (ddTASEP), thus broadening the scope of our investigation to a larger class of problems related to transcription and translation. We extend the mean-field theory to the open boundary case, revealing the system's phase diagram and critical values of entry and exit rates. However, we identify a significant discrepancy between theory and simulations in a region of the parameter space, indicating severe finite-size effects. To address this, we develop a single-cluster approximation that captures the relationship between current and lattice size, providing a more accurate representation of the system's dynamics. Finally, we extend our approach to open boundary conditions, demonstrating its applicability in different scenarios. Our findings underscore the importance of considering finite-size effects, often overlooked in the literature, when modelling biological processes such as transcription and translation.

Title: Vortices in the Many-Body Excited States of Interacting Bosons in Two Dimension
Authors: Mateusz Ślusarczyk, Krzysztof Pawłowski
Abstract: Quantum vortices play an important role in the physics of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems, though they usually are understood in the single-particle framework like the mean-field approach. Inspired by the study on the relations between solitons and yrast states, we investigate here the emergence of vortices from the eigenstates of a N -body Hamiltonian of interacting particles trapped in a disk. We analyse states that appear by consecutively measuring the positions of particles. These states have densities, phases, and energies closely resembling mean-field vortices. We discuss similarities, but also point out purely many-body features, such as vortex smearing due to the quantum fluctuation of their center. The ab initio analysis of the many-body system, and mean-field approaches are supported by the analysis within the Bogoliubov approach.

Title: The quantum Newman-Moore model in a longitudinal field
Authors: Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.

Title: Mechanical stability conditions for 3D and 2D crystals under arbitrary load
Authors: Marcin Maździarz
Abstract: The paper gathers and unifies mechanical stability conditions for all symmetry classes of 3D and 2D materials under arbitrary load. The methodology is based on the spectral decomposition of the fourth-order stiffness tensors mapped to second-order tensors using orthonormal (Mandel) notation, and the verification of the positivity of the so-called Kelvin moduli. An explicit set of stability conditions for 3D and 2D crystals of higher symmetry is also included, as well as a Mathematica notebook that allows mechanical stability analysis for crystals, stress-free and stressed, of arbitrary symmetry under arbitrary loads.

Title: An alternative GPU acceleration for a pseudopotential plane-waves density functional theory code with applications to metallic systems
Authors: Xuejun Gong, Andrea Dal Corso
Abstract: We present an alternative GPU acceleration for plane waves pseudopotentials electronic structure codes designed for systems that have small unit cells but require a large number of k points to sample the Brillouin zone as happens, for instance, in metals. We discuss the diagonalization of the Kohn and Sham equations and the solution of the linear system derived in density functional perturbation theory. Both problems take advantage from a rewriting of the routine that applies the Hamiltonian to the Bloch wave-functions to work simultaneously (in parallel on the GPU threads) on the wave-functions with different wave-vectors k, as many as allowed by the GPU memory. Our implementation is written in CUDA Fortran and makes extensive use of kernel routines that run on the GPU (GLOBAL routines) or can be called from inside the GPU threads (DEVICE routines). We compare our method with the CPUs only calculation and with the approach currently implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO that uses GPU accelerated libraries for the FFT and for the linear algebra tasks such as the matrix-matrix multiplications as well as OpenACC directives for loop parallelization. We show in a realistic example that our method can give a significant improvement in the cases for which it has been designed.

Title: Exact solvability of an Ising-type model, and exact solvability of the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models
Authors: Pete Rigas
Abstract: We compute the action-angle coordinates for an Ising type model whose L-operator has been previously studied in the literature by Bazhanov and Sergeev. In comparison to computations with such operators that have been examined previously by the author for the 4-vertex, 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, computations for asymptotically approximating a collection of sixteen identities with the Poisson bracket, which together constitute the Poisson structure of the Ising type model, exhibit dependencies upon nearest neighbor interactions. Inspite of the fact that L-operators for the 20-vertex model are defined in terms of combinatorial, and algebraic, constituents unlike such operators for the 6-vertex model which are defined in terms of projectors and Pauli basis elements, L-operators for the Ising-type model can be used for concluding that a model which interpolates between the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models is exactly solvable.

Title: Two-Peak Heat Capacity Accounts for $R\ln(2)$ Entropy and Ground State Access in the Dipole-Octupole Pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$
Authors: E. M. Smith, A. Fitterman, R. Schäfer, B. Placke, A. Woods, S. Lee, S. H.-Y. Huang, J. Beare, S. Sharma, D. Chatterjee, C. Balz, M. B. Stone, A. I. Kolesnikov, A. R. Wildes, E. Kermarrec, G. M. Luke, O. Benton, R. Moessner, R. Movshovich, A. D. Bianchi, B. D. Gaulin
Abstract: Magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high-quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K are reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However, a second sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, signifying the entrance to the ground state. The ground state appears to have gapped excitations, as even the most abrupt extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K fully accounts for the $R\ln(2)$ entropy associated with the pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$ at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$ for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical spin liquid to a quantum spin liquid (QSL). For both scenarios, comparison of the measured $C_P$ with NLC calculations suggests that weak interactions beyond the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian become relevant below $T \sim 0.25$ K. The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI). Together with the peak in the heat capacity at $T_2$, this diffuse scattering from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ is suggestive of a classical spin liquid regime above $T_2$ that is distinct from the zero-entropy quantum ground state below $T_2$.

Title: Spin-phonon coupling and thermal Hall effect in the Kitaev model
Authors: Taekoo Oh, Naoto Nagaosa
Abstract: The Kitaev model, which involves bond-direction-dependent spin interactions on a honeycomb lattice, has attracted significant interest due to its exact solvability and potential uses in quantum computing. A key feature of this model is the half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity (HQTHC) under a magnetic field perpendicular to the lattice; however, HQTHC only appears at low temperatures. Here, in the higher temperature range beyond the HQTHC regime, we theoretically suggest an extrinsic phonon contribution to the thermal Hall effect in the Kitaev model through skew-scattering of chiral phonons by scalar spin chirality, previously examined in Mott insulators. We demonstrate the emergence of scalar spin chirality from fluctuating spins, estimate the resulting field strength and its symmetric form applied to chiral phonons, and obtain the associated thermal Hall conductivity in semi-quantitative agreement with existing experiments. This work offers a fundamental understanding of how spin-phonon interactions influence strongly correlated systems.

Title: Screening and localization in the nonlinear Anderson problem
Authors: Alexander V. Milovanov, Alexander Iomin
Abstract: We study the spreading dynamics of an initially localized wave packet in 1D nonlinear Schrödinger lattices with random potential. It is shown that adding small dielectric coupling to surrounding random medium results in asymptotic localization of the nonlinear field. The nonlinear localization length depends on dielectric loss of the medium at low temperatures and the value of nonlinearity parameter. The model predicts a possibility of self-induced localization when the ``medium" to which the wave field is dielectrically coupled is the nonlinear wave itself.

Title: Dual Spectroscopy of Quantum Simulated Fermi-Hubbard Systems
Authors: K. Knakkergaard Nielsen, M. Zwierlein, G. M. Bruun
Abstract: Quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides remarkable insights into the real space properties of many-body systems, but does not directly reveal the nature of their fundamental excitation spectrum. Here, we demonstrate that radio-frequency spectroscopy can reveal the quasi-particle nature of doped quantum many-body systems, crucial for our understanding of, e.g., high-temperature superconductors. In particular, we showcase how the existence and energy of magnetic polaron quasi-particles in doped Fermi-Hubbard systems may be probed, revealed by hallmark peaks in the spectroscopic spectrum. In combination with fundamental dualities of the Fermi-Hubbard model, we describe how these findings may be tested using several experimental platforms.

Title: Charge-polarized superconducting state emerging in a superatomic antipolar metal

Abstract: The simultaneous presence of polarity and metallicity or superconductivity in a material signifies the exotic polar metallic or superconducting (SC) state, while such materials are extremely rare due to their exclusive nature. Recently, the interweaved CDW and antipolar charge orders have been discovered in a metallic superatomic crystal of Au6Te12Se8 (ATS), while their interplay and competition with the following emergent SC state remains elusive. Here, we report a further experimental investigation of the SC state emerged from the preformed CDW and antipolar order states using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy in combination with transport and Raman measurements. The temperature-dependent pre-formation and condensation of Cooper pairs are experimentally identified. The pre-existent CDW is gradually suppressed by the preformed Cooper pairs, and then the antipolar charge order is spatially suppressed into a ferrielectric-like polar order by the condensed Cooper pairs of SC state. The exotic charge-polarized superconducting state is discovered in the polar metal of ATS, suggesting a valuable platform for the exploration of intriguing polar superconducting properties.

Title: Hierarchical Bayesian inference for uncertainty quantification of thermal grease rheology
Authors: Pranay P. Nagrani, Akshay J. Thomas, Amy M. Marconnet, Ivan C. Christov
Abstract: Rheologically complex soft solids such as thermal greases consist of filler particles within a polymer matrix. These materials find applications in improving the conformity of solid-solid contacts and enhancing heat transfer. Complex soft solids exhibit a transient non-Newtonian rheological response, including thixotropy and viscoelasticity. Previously, stress relaxation and buildup in sheared commercial thermal greases were successfully captured using a nonlinear elasto-visco-plastic (NEVP) model and a thixo-elasto-visco-plastic (TEVP). However, the previous model calibration methods ignored parameter uncertainty, providing only single values of the rheological parameters, and did not quantitatively address the chosen model's identifiability from the data or credibility of the calibration. We address these limitations via hierarchical Bayesian inference, accounting for uncertainties arising from epistemic and aleatoric sources. Importantly, the hierarchical approach allows us to assimilate experiments measuring the stress responses at various startup shear rates by allowing the models' parameters to vary across different shear rates. Then, a global distribution and the associated uncertainty are obtained by pooling. We also propagate uncertainties to the transient shear stress response predicted by the models. Overall, we demonstrate that the chosen NEVP and TEVP models are identifiable from rheometric startup data. However, for the TEVP model, the uncertainty of the parameters is lower (narrower distributions) when higher shear rates are used for inference.

Title: Universal exotic dynamics in critical mesoscopic systems: Simulating the square root of Avogadro's number of spins
Authors: Mauro Bisson, Alexandros Vasilopoulos, Massimo Bernaschi, Massimiliano Fatica, Nikolaos G. Fytas, Isidoro González-Adalid Pemartín, Víctor Martín-Mayor
Abstract: We explicitly demonstrate the universality of critical dynamics through unprecedented large-scale GPU-based simulations of two out-of-equilibrium processes, comparing the behavior of spin-$1/2$ Ising and spin-$1$ Blume-Capel models on a square lattice. In the first protocol, a completely disordered system is instantaneously brought into contact with a thermal bath at the critical temperature, allowing it to evolve until the coherence length exceeds $10^{3}$ lattice spacings. Finite-size effects are negligible due to the mesoscopic scale of the lattice sizes studied, with linear dimensions up to $L=2^{22}$ and $2^{19}$ for the Ising and Blume-Capel models, respectively. Our numerical data, and the subsequent analysis, demonstrate a strong dynamic universality between the two models and provide the most precise estimate to date of the dynamic critical exponent for this universality class, $z = 2.1676(1)$. In the second protocol, we corroborate the role of the universal ratio of dynamic and static length scales in achieving an exponential acceleration in the approach to equilibrium just \emph{above} the critical temperature, through a time-dependent variation of the thermal bath temperature. The results presented in this work leverage our CUDA-based numerical code, breaking the world record for the simulation speed of the Ising model.

Title: Alloying as a new route to generating interlayer excitons
Authors: Suvadip Masanta, Chumki Nayak, Premananda Chatterjee, Atindra Nath Pal, Indrani Bose, Achintya Singha
Abstract: Heterobilayers formed by stacking two-dimensional atomic crystals are particularly promising for low-dimensional semiconductor optics, as they host interlayer excitons, bound states of electrons and holes residing in different layers. They inherit the valley-contrasting physics of the individual monolayers, leading to a range of unique properties that distinguish them from other solid-state nanostructures. Here, we propose a novel route for the generation of interlayer excitons based on the synthesis of a transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer alloy material, WS$_{2x}$Se$_{2(1-x)}$. Using piezoelectric force microscopy, we demonstrate the existence of an internal electric field oriented in the out-of-plane direction. Interlayer excitons have so far been mostly observed in heterostructures with a type-II band alignment. In the presence of an internal electric field, a similar alignment occurs in the alloy bilayer resulting in an efficient generation of interlayer excitons. Photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements involving circularly polarised light come up with key observations like a negative degree of circular polarization of the interlayer excitons which increases as a function of temperature. A simple theoretical model provides a physical understanding of the major experimentally observed features. With experimentally fitted parameter values, the dominant contribution to the degree of circular polarization is shown to arise from spin polarization and not from valley polarization, a consequence of the spin-valley-layer coupling characteristic of a TMDC bilayer. The room-temperature interlayer excitonic transition in bilayer TMDCs has key implications for fundamental physics, including Bose-Einstein condensation and high-temperature superfluidity, while enabling advanced valleytronic and quantum information functionalities.

Title: Mitigation of exchange cross-talk in dense quantum dot arrays
Authors: Daniel Jirovec, Pablo Cova Fariña, Stefano Reale, Stefan D. Oosterhout, Xin Zhang, Sander de Snoo, Amir Sammak, Giordano Scappucci, Menno Veldhorst, Lieven M. K. Vandersypen
Abstract: Coupled spins in semiconductor quantum dots are a versatile platform for quantum computing and simulations of complex many-body phenomena. However, on the path of scale-up, cross-talk from densely packed electrodes poses a severe challenge. While cross-talk onto the dot potentials is nowadays routinely compensated for, cross-talk on the exchange interaction is much more difficult to tackle because it is not always directly measurable. Here we propose and implement a way of characterizing and compensating cross-talk on adjacent exchange interactions by following the singlet-triplet avoided crossing in Ge. We show that we can easily identify the barrier-to-barrier cross-talk element without knowledge of the particular exchange value in a 2x4 quantum dot array. We uncover striking differences among these cross-talk elements which can be linked to the geometry of the device and the barrier gate fan-out. We validate the methodology by tuning up four-spin Heisenberg chains. The same methodology should be applicable to longer chains of spins and to other semiconductor platforms in which mixing of the singlet and the lowest-energy triplet is present or can be engineered. Additionally, this procedure is well suited for automated tuning routines as we obtain a stand-out feature that can be easily tracked and directly returns the magnitude of the cross-talk.

Title: Effective perpendicular electric field as a probe for interlayer pairing in ambient-pressure superconducting La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ thin films
Authors: Junkang Huang, Tao Zhou
Abstract: Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments on La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films have revealed a superconducting gap near the diagonal direction for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, confined to a narrow momentum region. Our numerical calculations indicate that interlayer pairing is dominant, resulting in an $s_\pm$-wave symmetry. We propose employing perpendicular electric fields, a practical method in thin film systems, to verify the pairing symmetry. Our calculations predict that such fields will induce Fermi arcs or nodal points and significantly modulate the gap near the diagonal, with the modulated region overlapping the area probed by ARPES. This approach provides an effective tool for probing pairing symmetry in bilayer nickelate thin films, especially given current limitations in experimental techniques.

Title: Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of vacuum decay
Authors: Alexander C. Jenkins, Hiranya V. Peiris, Andrew Pontzen
Abstract: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.

Title: First-passage properties of the jump process with a drift. Two exactly solvable cases
Authors: Ivan N. Burenev, Satya N. Majumdar
Abstract: We investigate the first-passage properties of a jump process with a constant drift, focusing on two key observables: the first-passage time $\tau$ and the number of jumps $n$ before the first-passage event. By mapping the problem onto an effective discrete-time random walk, we derive an exact expression for the Laplace transform of the joint distribution of $\tau$ and $n$ using the generalized Pollaczek-Spitzer formula. This result is then used to analyze the first-passage properties for two exactly solvable cases: (i) both the inter-jump intervals and jump amplitudes are exponentially distributed, and (ii) the inter-jump intervals are exponentially distributed while all jumps have the same fixed amplitude. We show the existence of two distinct regimes governed by the strength of the drift: (i) a survival regime, where the process remains positive indefinitely with finite probability; (ii) an absorption regime, where the first-passage eventually occurs; and (iii) a critical point at the boundary between these two phases. We characterize the asymptotic behavior of survival probabilities in each regime: they decay exponentially to a constant in the survival regime, vanish exponentially fast in the absorption regime, and exhibit power-law decay at the critical point. Furthermore, in the absorption regime, we derive large deviation forms for the marginal distributions of $\tau$ and n. The analytical predictions are validated through extensive numerical simulations.

Title: Multiplicative Operator Formalism for Noncollinear Functionals in Multicollinear Approach
Authors: Xiaoyu Zhang, Taoni Bao
Abstract: Accurate calculation of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear magnetism requires noncollinear density functionals within the two-component generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) framework, yet constructing and implementing noncollinear functionals remains challenging. Recently, a well-defined methodology called the multicollinear approach was proposed to extend collinear functionals into noncollinear ones. While previous research focuses on its matrix representation, the present work derives its multiplicative operator formalism. We implement these new equations in our noncollinear functional ensemble named NCXC, which is expected to facilitate compatibility with most DFT software packages. Since the multicollinear approach was proposed for solving nonphysical properties and mathematical singularities in noncollinear functionals, we validate its accuracy in practical periodic systems, including noncollinear magnetism in spin spirals, band structures in topological insulators, and band gaps in semiconducting inorganic materials.

Title: A Unified Predictive and Generative Solution for Liquid Electrolyte Formulation
Authors: Zhenze Yang, Yifan Wu, Xu Han, Ziqing Zhang, Haoen Lai, Zhenliang Mu, Tianze Zheng, Siyuan Liu, Zhichen Pu, Zhi Wang, Zhiao Yu, Sheng Gong, Wen Yan
Abstract: Liquid electrolytes are critical components of next-generation energy storage systems, enabling fast ion transport, minimizing interfacial resistance, and ensuring electrochemical stability for long-term battery performance. However, measuring electrolyte properties and designing formulations remain experimentally and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration, making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design, demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently multi-objective nature of materials design. As a proof of concept, we experimentally identified three liquid electrolytes with both high ionic conductivity and anion-concentrated solvation structure. This unified framework advances data-driven electrolyte design and can be readily extended to other complex chemical systems beyond electrolytes.

Title: Modeling complex particle suspensions: perspectives on the rigid multiblob method
Authors: Blaise Delmotte, Florencio Balboa Usabiaga
Abstract: Many suspensions contain particles with complex shapes that are affected not only by hydrodynamics, but also by thermal fluctuations, internal kinematic constraints and other long-range non-hydrodynamic interactions. Modeling these systems represents a significant numerical challenge due to the interplay between different effects and the need to accurately capture multiscale phenomena. In this article we review recent developments to model large suspensions of particles of arbitrary shapes and multiple couplings with controllable accuracy within the rigid multiblob framework. We discuss the governing equations, highlight key numerical developments, and illustrate applications ranging from microswimmers to complex colloidal suspensions. This review illustrates the effectiveness and versatility of the rigid multiblob method in tackling a wide range of physical problems in fluid mechanics, soft matter physics, biophysics, materials and colloidal science.

Title: Mapping of Microstructure Transitions during Rapid Alloy Solidification Using Bayesian-Guided Phase-Field Simulations
Authors: José Mancias, Brent Vela, Juan Flórez-Coronel, Rouhollah Tavakoli, Douglas Allaire, Raymundo Arróyave, Damien Tourret
Abstract: This study addresses microstructure selection mechanisms in rapid solidification, specifically targeting the transition from cellular/dendritic to planar interface morphologies under conditions relevant to additive manufacturing. We use a phase-field model that quantitatively captures solute trapping, kinetic undercooling, and morphological instabilities across a broad range of growth velocities ($V$) and thermal gradients ($G$), and apply it to a binary Fe-Cr alloy, as a surrogate for 316L stainless steel. By combining high-fidelity phase-field simulations with a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian active learning approach, we efficiently map the microstructure transitions in the multi-dimensional space of composition, growth velocity, and temperature gradient. We compare our PF results to classical theories for rapid solidification. The classical KGT model yields an accurate prediction of the value of $G$ above which the interface is planar for any growth velocity. Microstructures transition from dendrites to cells as the temperature gradient increases close to this value of $G$. We also identify the occurrence of unstable "intermediate" microstructures at the border between dendritic and planar at low $G$, in the absence of banding instability in this Fe-Cr alloy. Our results highlight the capabilities of Bayesian-guided PF approaches in exploring complex microstructural transitions in multidimensional parameters spaces, thereby providing a robust computational tool for designing process parameters to achieve targeted microstructures and properties in rapidly solidified metallic alloys.

Title: Bootstrapping Nonequilibrium Stochastic Processes
Authors: Minjae Cho
Abstract: We show that bootstrap methods based on the positivity of probability measures provide a systematic framework for studying both synchronous and asynchronous nonequilibrium stochastic processes on infinite lattices. First, we formulate linear programming problems that use positivity and invariance property of invariant measures to derive rigorous bounds on their expectation values. Second, for time evolution in asynchronous processes, we exploit the master equation along with positivity and initial conditions to construct linear and semidefinite programming problems that yield bounds on expectation values at both short and late times. We illustrate both approaches using two canonical examples: the contact process in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, and the Domany-Kinzel model in both synchronous and asynchronous forms in 1+1 dimensions. Our bounds on invariant measures yield rigorous lower bounds on critical rates, while those on time evolutions provide two-sided bounds on the half-life of the infection density and the temporal correlation length in the subcritical phase.

Title: Time Glasses: Symmetry Broken Chaotic Phase with a Finite Gap
Authors: Taiki Haga
Abstract: We introduce the time glass, a non-periodic analogue of the discrete time crystal that arises in periodically driven dissipative quantum many-body systems. This phase is defined by two key features: (i) spatial long-range order arising from the spontaneous breaking of an internal symmetry, and (ii) temporally chaotic oscillations of the order parameter, whose lifetime diverges with system size. In other words, a time glass is a state of matter in which all components evolve in a synchronized yet chaotic manner. To characterize the time glass phase, we focus on the spectral gap of the one-cycle (Floquet) Liouvillian, which determines the decay rate of the slowest relaxation mode. Numerical studies of periodically driven dissipative Ising models show that, in the time glass phase, the Liouvillian gap remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, in contrast to time crystals where the gap closes exponentially with system size. We further demonstrate that the Liouvillian gap converges to the decay rate of the order-parameter autocorrelation derived from the classical (mean-field) dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. This result establishes a direct correspondence between microscopic spectral features and emergent macroscopic dynamics in driven dissipative quantum systems. At first glance, the existence of a nonzero Liouvillian gap appears incompatible with the presence of indefinitely persistent chaotic oscillations. We resolve this apparent paradox by showing that the quantum Rényi divergence between a localized coherent initial state and the highly delocalized steady state grows unboundedly with system size. This divergence allows long-lived transients to persist even in the presence of a finite Liouvillian gap.

Title: Hop-Decorate: An Automated Atomistic Workflow for Generating Defect Transport Data in Chemically Complex Materials
Authors: Peter Hatton, Blas Pedro Uberuaga, Danny Perez
Abstract: Chemically complex materials (CCMs) exhibit extraordinary functional properties but pose significant challenges for atomistic modeling due to their vast configurational heterogeneity. We introduce Hop-Decorate (HopDec), a high-throughput, Python-based atomistic workflow that automates the generation of defect transport data in CCMs. HopDec integrates accelerated molecular dynamics with a novel redecoration algorithm to efficiently sample migration pathways across chemically diverse local environments. The method constructs a defect-state graph in which transitions are associated with distributions of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, enabling direct input into kinetic Monte Carlo and other mesoscale models. We demonstrate HopDec's capabilities through applications to a Cu-Ni alloy and the spinel oxide (Fe,Ni)Cr2O4, revealing simple predictive relationships in the former and complex migration behaviors driven by cation disorder in the latter. These results highlight HopDec's ability to extract physically meaningful trends and support reduced-order or machine-learned models of defect kinetics, bridging atomic-scale simulations and mesoscale predictions in complex material systems.

Title: High thermal conductivity dominated by thermal phonons with mean free paths exceeding hundred nanometer in three-dimensional covalent organic framework derivatives: a molecular dynamics study
Authors: Sungjae Kim, Taeyong Kim
Abstract: Thermal properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of fundamental interest owing to exceptional heat conduction properties. Recent studies have suggested that their thermal conductivities can be enhanced by multiple factors such as pore size, mass density, and degree of chain order. However, microscopic processes that govern heat conduction properties have been explored in only a limited number of COFs. Here, we report thermal transport properties of 3D COF derivatives using molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we have studied six different COF-102 derivatives with different organic linkers and topologies. Among the derivatives studied, we found that COF-102 derivatives with high mass density can exhibit thermal conductivity as high as ~ 27 W/mK, owing to suppressed chain rotation that leads to thermal phonons scattered by anharmonicity. Our results show that the observed orders of magnitude of increase in the thermal conductivity are primarily attributed to low frequency phonon modes that support hundreds of nanometer scale mean free path, which predominantly carry heat. Our study provides a theoretical framework that elucidates the structure-property relationship governing heat conduction in COFs, offering design strategies for thermal management applications.

Title: Beyond Fragmented Dopant Dynamics in Quantum Spin Lattices: Robust Localization and Sub-diffusion
Authors: Mingru Yang, Sajant Anand, Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen
Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$-$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is localized for all investigated nonzero temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for decreasing temperatures.

Title: False signatures of non-ergodic behavior in disordered quantum many-body systems
Authors: Adith Sai Aramthottil, Ali Emami Kopaei, Piotr Sierant, Lev Vidmar, Jakub Zakrzewski
Abstract: Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.

Title: A set of nearly good real numbers to specify the eigenstates of a medium-body system with two kinds of spin-1 cold atoms and with the Hamiltonian containing non-commutable terms
Authors: Yanzhang He, Yimin Liu, Chengguang Bao
Abstract: A distinguished feature of multi-species boson systems is the appearance of the odd channel, in which the coupled spin of two different bosons is given by an odd number. Through exact numerical solutions of the Schrödinger equation for a medium-body cold system containing two types of spin-1 atoms, the effect of the odd channel has been studied. It was found that, due to the odd channel, the terms in the Hamiltonian are no longer all commutable. Accordingly, the combined spin of a single species is no longer conserved. However, when the parameters of interactions lie in some specific and broad domains, instead of a set of good quantum numbers, the ground-state (g.s.) can be specified by a set of nearly good real numbers. Each of them is not exactly a number but a very narrow interval on the positive real axis. The widths of the intervals would tend to zero when the particle numbers tend to infinity. When the parameters vary, the nearly good numbers can jump suddenly from one narrow interval to another well-separated narrow interval. Since the results of this paper are extracted from the exact solution of a medium-body system and not from a many-body approach as usual, for general many-body systems with Hamiltonians containing non-commutable terms, it remains to be clarified whether specific domains exist in the parameter space in which a set of nearly good real numbers can be used to specify the eigenstates.

Title: Electrochemically-driven formation of Intermetallic Cu3ZnLi2 alters Li-transport in nanostructured bimetallic battery anode

Abstract: The role of Li-based batteries in the electrification of society cannot be understated, however their operational lifetime is often limited by the formation of dendrites, i.e. the localised deposition of Li that can cause shorts between the two electrodes leading to the failure of the battery. Nanocrystalline bimetallic current collectors can be used for anode-free Li-metal batteries, with improved Li plating and limited or suppressed formation of dendrites. Here, we demonstrate that the microstructure of an alpha-Brass current collector, Cu 63% Zn 37%, used in an anode-free Li-metal battery evolves during cycling. It initially had a nanocrystalline deformation layer approximately 80 nm in thickness after polishing. After 100 cycles, the initial deformed brass layer was partially converted to a ternary Laves phase Cu3ZnLi2 within a nanocrystalline brass matrix that grew to 200 - 250 nm in thickness. Upon Li stripping, the phase partially decomposes electrochemically, but what remains can sequester Li thus forming "dead Li" thereby contributing to capacity loss. We propose a mechanism for the microstructural evolution including dynamic recrystallization and phase formation. Since this ternary Laves phase emerges during electrochemical cycling alone, binary alloy current collectors must be assessed for metastable ternary phase formation under different cycling conditions to either stabilize and exploit such phases or electrochemically fully strip them.

Title: Multi-Gap superconductivity in HgS under pressure
Authors: Pietro Maria Forcella, Cesare Tresca, Antonio Sanna, Gianni Profeta
Abstract: Mercury chalcogenides are a class of materials that exhibit diverse structural phases under pressure, leading to a range of exotic physical properties, including topological phases and chiral phonons. In particular, the phase diagram of mercury sulfide (HgS) remains difficult to characterize, with significant uncertainty surrounding the transition pressure between phases. Based on recent experimental results, we employ Density Functional Theory and Superconducting Density Functional Theory to investigate the pressure-induced structural phase transition in HgS and its interplay with the emergence of superconductivity as the crystal transitions from the cinnabar phase (space group P3$_1$21) to the rock salt phase (space group Fm$\bar{3}$m). Remarkably, the rocksalt phase hosts a multigap superconducting state driven by distinct Fermi surface sheets, with two dominant gaps; the unusually high critical temperature of $\sim$11 K emerges naturally within this multiband scenario, highlighting the role of interband coupling beyond isotropic models. These results place HgS among the few systems where multiband superconducting gap structures emerge under pressure.

Title: Shapes of magnetic monopoles in effective $SU(2)$ models
Authors: Petr Beneš, Filip Blaschke
Abstract: We present a systematic exploration of a general family of effective $SU(2)$ models with an adjoint scalar. First, we discuss a redundancy in this class of models and use it to identify seemingly different, yet physically equivalent models. Next, we construct the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit and derive analytic monopole solutions. In contrast to the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole, included here as a special case, these solutions tend to exhibit more complex energy density profiles. Typically, we obtain monopoles with a hollow cavity at their core where virtually no energy is concentrated; accordingly, most of the monopole's energy is stored in a spherical shell around its core. Moreover, the shell itself can be structured, with several "sub-shells". A recipe for the construction of these analytic solutions is presented.

Title: Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model
Authors: Pete Rigas
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.

Title: Joint Estimation of a Two-Phase Spin Rotation beyond Classical Limit
Authors: Jiahao Cao, Xinwei Li, Tianwei Mao, Wenxin Xu, Li You
Abstract: Quantum metrology employs entanglement to enhance measurement precision. The focus and progress so far have primarily centered on estimating a single parameter. In diverse application scenarios, the estimation of more than one single parameter is often required. Joint estimation of multiple parameters can benefit from additional advantages for further enhanced precision. Here we report quantum-enhanced measurement of simultaneous spin rotations around two orthogonal axes, making use of spin-nematic squeezing in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. Aided by the $F=2$ atomic ground hyperfine manifold coupled to the nematic-squeezed $F=1$ states as an auxiliary field through a sequence of microwave (MW) pulses, simultaneous measurement of multiple spin-1 observables is demonstrated, reaching an enhancement of 3.3 to 6.3 decibels (dB) beyond the classical limit over a wide range of rotation angles. Our work realizes the first enhanced multi-parameter estimation using entangled massive particles as a probe. The techniques developed and the protocols implemented also highlight the application of two-mode squeezed vacuum states in quantum-enhanced sensing of noncommuting spin rotations simultaneously.

Title: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in a $SO(3)$ non-Abelian lattice gauge theory in $2+1$D with quantum algorithms
Authors: Sandip Maiti, Debasish Banerjee, Bipasha Chakraborty, Emilie Huffman
Abstract: The simulation of various properties of quantum field theories is rapidly becoming a testing ground for demonstrating the prowess of quantum algorithms. Some examples include the preparation of ground states, as well as the investigation of various simple wave packets relevant for scattering phenomena. In this paper, we study the ability of quantum algorithms to prepare ground states in a matter-free non-Abelian $SO(3)$ lattice gauge theory in $2+1$D in a phase where the global charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is challenging for two reasons: the necessity of dealing with a large Hilbert space for gauge theories compared to that of quantum spin models, and the closing of the gap between the two ground states, which becomes exponentially small as a function of the volume. To deal with the large Hilbert space of gauge fields, we demonstrate how the exact imposition of the non-Abelian Gauss Law in the rishon representation of the quantum link operator significantly reduces the degrees of freedom. Further, to resolve the gap, we introduce symmetry-guided ansätze in the Gauss-Law-resolved basis for trial states as the starting point for the quantum algorithms to prepare the two lowest energy states. In addition to simulation results for a range of two-dimensional system sizes, we also provide experimental results from the trapped-ion-based quantum hardware, IonQ, when working on systems with four quantum links. The experimental/simulation results derived from our theoretical developments indicate the role of metrics--such as the energy and the infidelity--to assess the obtained results.

Title: Random non-Hermitian Hamiltonian framework for symmetry breaking dynamics
Authors: Pei Wang
Abstract: We propose random non-Hermitian Hamiltonians to model the generic stochastic nonlinear dynamics of a quantum state in Hilbert space. Our approach features an underlying linearity in the dynamical equations, ensuring the applicability of techniques used for solving linear systems. Additionally, it offers the advantage of easily incorporating statistical symmetry, a generalization of explicit symmetry to stochastic processes. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to describe real-time dynamics, starting from an initial symmetry-preserving state and evolving into a randomly distributed, symmetry-breaking final state. Our model serves as a quantum framework for the transition process, from disordered states to ordered ones, where symmetry is spontaneously broken.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework that generalizes the concept of anyon statistics, based on string operators and many-body Hilbert space, to invertible topological excitations of any dimensions. This framework is only build on several fundamental facts in quantum mechanics, while providing a novel, rigorous, and self-contained theory of statistics. Our definition of statistics can be computed directly using a computer, and the result aligns with existing physical theories.

Title: Relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function localization induced by nonHermitian colored noise
Authors: Pei Wang
Abstract: We propose a relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function collapse, based on a random nonHermitian action where the fermion density operator is coupled to a universal colored noise. Upon quantization, the wave function obeys a nonlinear stochastic differential equation that respects statistical Lorentz symmetry. The localization mechanism is driven by the colored noise, derived from the d'Alembert equation using generalized stochastic calculus in 1+3-dimensional spacetime. We analytically determine the noise-induced localization length, which decreases as the size of the observable universe increases.

Title: Superconducting integrated on-demand quantum memory with microwave pulse preservation

Abstract: Microwave quantum memory represents a critical component for quantum radars and resource-efficient approaches to quantum error correction. Superconducting microwave resonators provide highly efficient storage, long coherence times, on-demand reading and even in memory pulse engineering, but it is still challenging to overcome design and materials induced loss channels for on-chip realization. In this work, we present a novel architecture of integrated superconducting quantum memory with a dynamically controlled RF-SQUID coupling element in pulse regime, thus ensuring high efficiency storage and cycling storage time. It demonstrates a memory cycle time of 1.51 $\mu s$ and 57.5% storage fidelity with preservation of the stored pulse shape during the retrieval at single-photon level excitations. We establish that while the proposed active coupler realization introduces no measurable fidelity degradation, the primary limitation arises from impedance matching and materials imperfections. The proposed architecture highlights a disruptive potential for on-chip qubit and memory integration for scalable quantum error correction, while identifying specific avenues for near-unity storage fidelity.

Title: Shallow quantum circuit for generating O(1)-entangled approximate state designs
Authors: Wonjun Lee, Minki Hhan, Gil Young Cho, Hyukjoon Kwon
Abstract: Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science. In this work, we discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. These resources can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega(\log (t/\epsilon))$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, entanglement, magic, and coherence do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states by transforming $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit, $O(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon))$, is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in quantum information processing. As a concrete example, we propose classical shadow tomography using an estimator with superpositions between only two states, which improves the runtime of a state certification task by requiring only $O(1)$ measurements and queries.
