Title: Interaction-Induced Higher-Order Topological Insulator via Floquet Engineering
Authors: Chun-Ping Su, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in both static single-particle and many-body lattice systems. While periodically driven (Floquet) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in such systems remains less understood. In this paper, we extend previous studies by investigating interaction-induced higher-order topological phases through Floquet engineering. To achieve this, we construct an extended Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice subjected to periodic driving. We demonstrate the emergence of interaction-induced normal Floquet second-order topological corner states for doublons (i.e., bound boson pairs) from a trivial phase, which exhibit robustness against disorder. Notably, beyond the normal phase, we reveal an interaction-induced anomalous Floquet second-order topological phase, where in-gap corner states of doublons emerge within the $\pi/T$ gap ($T$ being the driving period). Our model, accessible with state-of-the-art ultracold atom techniques, provides a platform for realizing interaction-driven higher-order topological phases uniquely enabled by periodic driving, with no direct counterparts in static or single-particle systems.

Title: Floquet non-Abelian topological charges and edge states
Authors: Jiaxin Pan, Longwen Zhou
Abstract: Non-Abelian topological insulators are characterized by matrix-valued, non-commuting topological charges with regard to more than one energy gap. Their descriptions go beyond the conventional topological band theory, in which an additive integer is endowed separately with each (degenerate group of) energy band(s). In this work, we reveal that Floquet (time-periodic) driving could not only enrich the topology and phase transitions of non-Abelian topological matter, but also induce bulk-edge correspondence unique to nonequilibrium setups. Using a one-dimensional (1D), three-band model as an illustrative example, we demonstrate that Floquet driving could reshuffle the phase diagram of the non-driven system, yielding both gapped and gapless Floquet band structures with non-Abelian topological charges. Moreover, by dynamically tuning the anomalous Floquet $\pi$-quasienergy gap, non-Abelian topological transitions inaccessible to static systems could arise, leading to much more complicated relations between non-Abelian topological charges and Floquet edge states. These discoveries put forth the periodic driving as a powerful scheme of engineering non-Abelian topological phases (NATPs) and incubating unique non-Abelian band topology beyond equilibrium.

Title: Robust strong-field theory model for ultrafast electron transport through metal-insulator-metal tunneling nanojunctions
Authors: Boyang Ma, Michael Krüger
Abstract: Ultrafast science studies the dynamics of electrons in matter with extreme temporal precision, typically in the attosecond and femtosecond time domain. Recent experimental and theoretical progress has put metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunneling nanojunctions in the spotlight of ultrafast science. Waveform-controlled laser fields can induce ultrafast currents in these junctions, opening the door to petahertz electronic operation and attosecond-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Inspired by our strong-field model for attosecond tunneling microscopy [Boyang Ma and Michael Krüger, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 236901 (2024)], here we generalize our model to MIM nanojunctions. We introduce several refinements and corrections, accounting for the image potential inside the gap and boundary effects. Moreover, we also find that the Keldysh parameter alone is insufficient for describing the physics in thin MIM nanojunctions. We introduce a new parameter $\zeta$ that accounts for the effects of the limited size of the junction and provide several interpretations of the parameter that shed new light on the complex physics in the light-driven junction. Most strikingly, we find that for $\zeta > 1$ photon-assisted tunneling is dominating the ultrafast electron transport across the junction, regardless of the value of the Keldysh parameter. Here one or more photons are absorbed and the electron undergoes static tunneling through the barrier. $\zeta < 1$ is required for a regime in which the laser field and the Keldysh parameter dominate the transport. We also discuss the three-step model of electron transport across the nanojunction in the adiabatic regime, the energy cutoff of the transported electrons and the carrier-envelope phase control of the net current. Our theory model provides a rich toolbox for understanding and predicting the physics of ultrafast MIM nanojunctions.

Title: Terahertz radiation generation by laser-resonant excitation of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons on a graphene-n-InSb semiconductor interface
Authors: Rohit Kumar Srivastav, Mrityunjay Kundu
Abstract: We propose a method for the laser-excitation of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons via the linear mode conversion of terahertz radiation on a graphene sheet deposited on an n-type semiconductor in presence of an external magnetic field parallel to the semiconductor surface. An obliquely incident p-polarized laser beam interacting with the graphene n-InSb semiconductor surface, imparts linear oscillatory velocity to the free electrons. This oscillatory velocity couples with the modulated electron density to generate a linear current density, which resonantly excites terahertz surface magnetoplasmons. It is shown that the amplitude of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons wave can be tuned by adjusting the external magnetic field ($\text{B}_{0}$), the graphene's Fermi energy ($\text{E}_\text{F}$), the semiconductor's temperature (T), and the incident angle ($\theta$) of laser. This mechanism has the potential to enable the development of an actively tunable plasmonic device.

Title: Structural, electronic, vibrational, optical, piezoelectric, thermal and thermoelectric properties of double perovskite BCZT from first-principles calculations
Authors: Debidutta Pradhan, Jagadish Kumar
Abstract: Double perovskite material such as BCZT (Ba$_{0.875}$Ca$_{0.125}$(Zr$_{0.125}$Ti$_{0.875}$)O$_{3}$) is well known for its high value of piezoceramic properties and Curie temperature which has potential applications in sensors, actuators, optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices. Based on its composition and physical parameters such as pressure and temperature, experimentally, BCZT shows different crystal structures (rhombohedral, tetragonal and orthorhombic) with multiferroic properties. Here, we have designed these materials by comparing experimental stoichiometry and evaluated their stability by calculating the tolerance factor, formation energy, and cohesive energy. The structural, electronic and vibrational properties of BCZT are explored using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within the framework of density functional theory. We have also shown variation of piezoelectric and optical properties through multiple phases using time dependent density functional theory. The electronic band gap, optical response in the visible light range, as well as piezoelectric, electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric properties, demonstrate excellent characteristics, making this material a promising lead-free ferroelectric candidate for various energy harvesting applications. Boltzmann transport theory is used for the calculation of Seebeck coefficient, electron thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity to estimate the power factor and figure of merit which represents the efficiency of the material. The high values at the Fermi level suggest that these materials are well-suited for future device applications.

Title: A control variate method for threshold crossing probabilities of plastic deformation driven by transient coloured noise
Authors: Harry L.F. Ip, Charlie Mathey, Laurent Mertz, Jonathan Wylie
Abstract: We propose a hybrid method combining partial differential equation (PDE) and Monte Carlo (MC) techniques to obtain efficient estimates of statistics for plastic deformation related to kinematic hardening models driven by transient coloured noise. Our approach employs a control variate strategy inspired by [CPAM, 75 (3), 455-492, 2022] and relies on a class of PDEs with non-standard boundary conditions, which we derive here. The solutions of those PDEs represent the statistics of models driven by transient white noise and are significantly easier to solve than the coloured noise version. We apply our method to threshold-crossing probabilities, which are used as failure criteria known as ultimate and serviceability limit states under non-stationary excitation. Our contribution provides solid grounds for such calculations and is significantly more computationally efficient in terms of variance reduction compared to standard MC simulations.

Title: Teaching Artificial Intelligence to Perform Rapid, Resolution-Invariant Grain Growth Modeling via Fourier Neural Operator
Authors: Iman Peivaste, Ahmed Makradi, Salim Belouettar
Abstract: Microstructural evolution, particularly grain growth, plays a critical role in shaping the physical, optical, and electronic properties of materials. Traditional phase-field modeling accurately simulates these phenomena but is computationally intensive, especially for large systems and fine spatial resolutions. While machine learning approaches have been employed to accelerate simulations, they often struggle with resolution dependence and generalization across different grain scales. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to achieve resolution-invariant modeling of microstructure evolution in multi-grain systems. FNO operates in the Fourier space and can inherently handle varying resolutions by learning mappings between function spaces. By integrating FNO with the phase field method, we developed a surrogate model that significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high accuracy across different spatial scales. We generated a comprehensive dataset from phase-field simulations using the Fan Chen model, capturing grain evolution over time. Data preparation involved creating input-output pairs with a time shift, allowing the model to predict future microstructures based on current and past states. The FNO-based neural network was trained using sequences of microstructures and demonstrated remarkable accuracy in predicting long-term evolution, even for unseen configurations and higher-resolution grids not encountered during training.

Title: Superconducting nonlinear Hall effect induced by geometric phases
Authors: Kazuaki Takasan, Naoto Tsuji
Abstract: We study the nonlinear Hall effect in superconductors without magnetic fields induced by a quantum geometric phase (i.e., the Aharonov-Bohm phase) carried by single or pair particles. We find that the second-order nonlinear Hall conductivity diverges in the dc limit in a robust way against dissipation when the system is superconducting, suggesting that the supercurrent flows perpendicular to the direction of the applied electric field. This superconducting nonlinear Hall effect (SNHE) is demonstrated for the Haldane model with attractive interaction and its variant with pair hoppings. In the Ginzburg-Landau theory, the SNHE can be understood as those arising from a higher-order Lifshitz invariant, that is, a symmetry invariant constructed from order parameters that contains an odd number of spatial derivatives. We perform real-time simulations including the effect of collective modes for the models driven by a multi-cycle pulse, and show that the SNHE leads to large rectification of the Hall current under light driving.

Title: Interaction tuned pattern-selective superconductivity: Application to the dodecagonal quasicrystal
Authors: Junmo Jeon, SungBin Lee
Abstract: Quasicrystals exhibit superconductivity under the unique interplay of long-range order and strong inhomogeneity, distinguishing them from both crystalline and amorphous systems. Understanding how this structural complexity affects superconducting states and phase transitions remains an important open question. Here, we unveil anomalous superconductivity in a dodecagonal quasicrystal using the attractive Hubbard model within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework. We show that both the gap structure and critical temperature depend on the local pattern due to inhomogeneous charge distribution and kinetic terms. This leads to unconventional phase transitions between mixed phases where superconducting and normal metal regions coexist, even without external fields, which we term pattern-selective superconductivity. Furthermore, superconductivity can be anomalously suppressed even under stronger attractive interactions due to the alignment of the Fermi level with a spectral gap in the fragmented Hartree-shifted spectrum. These findings, not observed in conventional crystals, amorphous systems, or previous studies of quasicrystal superconductivity, highlight the distinct role of quasicrystalline order.

Title: Yang-Lee Zeros of 2D Nearest-Neighbor Antiferromagnetic Ising Models: A Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion Study
Authors: Mahmoud Abdelshafy, Muhammad Sedik
Abstract: We study Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit of the 2D nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Ising model on square and triangular lattices. We employ the Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion (NLCE) equipped with Exact Enumeration (EE) of the partition function to estimate the Laplacian of the free energy, which is proportional to the zeros density. Using a modified NLCE, where the expansion can be carried directly on the Yang-Lee zeros of the involved clusters, we estimate the density of Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit. NLCE gives significantly more zeros than EE in the complex field plane providing more insights on how the root curves look in the thermodynamic limit. For the square lattice at $T \ll T_c$, the results suggest that two vertical lines at $\pm h_c(T)$ in the complex field plane (i.e two concentric circles in the complex fugacity plane) are the thermodynamic root curves. A similar picture is expected for the triangular lattice for phase transitions at large values of magnetic field while further study is needed for phase transitions at smaller values of magnetic field. The convergence of the NLCE and (EE) calculations of the partition function to the thermodynamic limit is studied in both lattices and the temperature-field phase diagram is obtained from Yang-Lee zeros using both methods. This NLCE-based approach will facilitate the study of different types of phase transitions using Yang-Lee zeros in future research.

Title: Confined and deconfined spinon excitations in the rectangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet
Authors: N. E. Shaik, E. Fogh, B. Dalla Piazza, B. Normand, D. Ivanov, H. M. Rønnow
Abstract: Fractionalization remains one of the most fascinating manifestations of strong interactions in quantum many-body systems. In quantum magnetism, the existence of spinons -- collective magnetic excitations that behave as quasiparticles with fractional quantum numbers -- is proven in spin chains, but the criteria for their appearance in higher dimensions remain disputed. Motivated by experiments reporting the observation of spinons at high energies in the square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we adopt the approach of extrapolating from where spinons are well defined. We study the dynamical properties of a Gutzwiller-projected wave function, the staggered-flux state, on a rectangular spin-1/2 Heisenberg lattice as a function of the spatial coupling ratio, $\gamma = J_y/J_x$. By studying the spectrum and the spinon separation distribution we show how, as the system evolves from one-dimensional (1D) towards 2D, the spinons become progressively more confined over most of reciprocal space, but remain deconfined at specific wave vectors.

Abstract: Over the past century, continuous advancements in electron microscopy have enabled the synthesis, control, and characterization of high-quality free-electron beams. These probes carry an evanescent electromagnetic field that can drive localized excitations and provide high-resolution information on material structures and their optical responses, currently reaching the sub-ångström and few-meV regime. Moreover, combining free electrons with pulsed light sources in ultrafast electron microscopy adds temporal resolution in the sub-femtosecond range while offering enhanced control of the electron wave function. Beyond their exceptional capabilities for time-resolved spectromicroscopy, free electrons are emerging as powerful tools in quantum nanophotonics, on par with photons in their ability to carry and transfer quantum information, create entanglement within and with a specimen, and reveal previously inaccessible details on nanoscale quantum phenomena. This Roadmap outlines the current state of this rapidly evolving field, highlights key challenges and opportunities, and discusses future directions through a collection of topical sections prepared by leading experts.

Title: Universal Exotic Dynamics in Critical Mesoscopic Systems: Simulating the Square Root of Avogadro's Number of Spins
Authors: Mauro Bisson, Alexandros Vasilopoulos, Massimo Bernaschi, Massimiliano Fatica, Nikolaos G. Fytas, Isidoro González-Adalid Pemartín, Víctor Martín-Mayor
Abstract: We explicitly demonstrate the universality of critical dynamics through unprecedented large-scale GPU-based simulations of two out-of-equilibrium processes, comparing the behavior of spin-$1/2$ Ising and spin-$1$ Blume-Capel models on a square lattice. In the first protocol, a completely disordered system is instantaneously brought into contact with a thermal bath at the critical temperature, allowing it to evolve until the coherence length exceeds $10^{3}$ lattice spacings. Finite-size effects are negligible due to the mesoscopic scale of the lattice sizes studied, with linear dimensions up to $L=2^{22}$ and $2^{19}$ for the Ising and Blume-Capel models, respectively. Our numerical data, and the subsequent analysis, demonstrate a strong dynamic universality between the two models and provide the most precise estimate to date of the dynamic critical exponent for this universality class, $z = 2.1676(1)$. In the second protocol, we corroborate the role of the universal ratio of dynamic and static length scales in achieving an exponential acceleration in the approach to equilibrium just \emph{above} the critical temperature, through a time-dependent variation of the thermal bath temperature. The results presented in this work leverage our CUDA-based numerical code, breaking the world record for the simulation speed of the Ising model.

Title: Dislocations in the elastic fields of randomly distributed defects
Authors: Ronghai Wu, Michael Zaiser
Abstract: In recent years, the behavior of dislocations in random solid solutions has received renewed interest, and several models have been discussed where random alloys are treated as effective media containing random distributions of dilatation and compression centers. More generally speaking, the arrangement of defects in metals and alloys is always characterized by statistical disorder, and the same is true for the fluctuating fields that arise from the superposition of the stress and strain fields of many defects. In order to develop models for the dynamics of dislocations interacting with such fields, a statistical description of the dislocation energy landscape and the associated configurational forces is needed, as well as methods for coarse graining these forces over dislocation segments of varying length and shape. In this context the problem arises how to regularize the highly singular stress fields associated with dislocations and other defects. Here we formulate an approach which is based upon evaluating the interaction energies and interaction forces between singular dislocations and other defects including solutes, modelled as point-like dilatation centers, and other dislocations. We characterize the interactions in terms of the probability densities of interaction energies and interaction forces, and the corresponding spatial correlation functions. We also consider the effects of dislocation core regularization, either in terms of continuously distributed Burgers vectors or by using the formalism of gradient elasticity of Helmholtz type to formulate a regularized energy functional.

Title: Magnetoelasticity in MnPt $L1_{0}$ system
Authors: Jakub Šebesta, Michal Vališka, Karol Synoradzki, Tamara J. Bednarchuk, Dominik Legut
Abstract: Magnetic materials play an important role in the industry. Except for common material parameters such as magnetocrystalline anisotropy, magnetoelastic behavior can be significant for application serving in various devices, e.g. in acoustic actuators, transducers, or sensors providing desirable fast response and high efficiency. Magnetoelasticit properties have been studied for the cubic system. However, their magnetoelastic behavior is weak. Therefore, we focus on Pt-based tetragonal binary compounds bearing engaging magnetic behavior. We evaluate MnPt magnetoelastic behavior using the finite displacement method, discussing the influence of the magnetic structure, and focusing on the origin. While, the theoretically obtained results are compared to our performed experiments.

Title: Quantum Geometry of Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Flat-Band Superconductivity
Authors: Aaron Dunbrack, Pauli Virtanen, Tero T. Heikkilä
Abstract: Several physical phenomena in superconductors, such as helical superconductivity and the diode effect, rely on breaking time-reversal symmetry. This symmetry-breaking is usually accounted for via the Lifshitz invariant, a contribution to the free energy which is linear in the phase gradient of the order parameter. In dispersive single-band superconductors with conventional pairing, the Lifshitz invariant can be computed from the asymmetries of the spectrum near the Fermi surface. We show that in multi-band superconductors, the quantum geometry also contributes to the Lifshitz invariant, and this is the dominant contribution when the low-energy bands are flat.

Title: Resetting Dyson Brownian motion
Authors: Marco Biroli, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new stochastic process of $N$ interacting particles on the line that evolve via Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) with Dyson's index $\beta > 0$ and undergo simultaneous resetting to their initial positions at a constant rate $r$. We call this process the resetting Dyson Brownian motion (RDBM) -- in short the $\beta$-RDBM. For $\beta = 1,2,4$, the positions of the particles in the RDBM can be interpreted as the eigenvalues of a random matrix ensemble where the entries of an $N x N$ Gaussian matrix evolve as simultaneously resetting Brownian motions (with rate $r$) in the presence or absence of a harmonic trap. For $r=0$ and in the presence of a harmonic trap, this system reaches an equilibrium Gibbs-Boltzmann state of the so called Dyson log-gas. However, the stochastic resetting drives the system at long time to a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS). We compute exactly the joint distribution of the positions of the particles in this NESS for all $\beta>0$ and calculate several observables for large $N$: the average density profile of the gas, the extreme value statistics, the spacing between two consecutive particles and the full counting statistics. We show that a nonzero resetting rate $r>0$ drastically changes the nature of the fluctuations in the stationary state: while the log-gas is rather rigid, the $\beta$-RDBM in its NESS becomes fluffy, i.e., the fluctuations of different observables are of the same order as their mean. In the absence of a harmonic trap, our results for the $\beta = 2$-RDBM can be related to nonintersecting Brownian motions in the presence of resetting. Our model demonstrates interesting effects arising from the interplay between the eigenvalue repulsion and the all-to-all attraction (generated by stochastic resetting) in an interacting particle system. Numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with our analytical results.

Title: Steric Engineering of Exciton Fine Structure in 2D Perovskites
Authors: Mateusz Dyksik, Michal Baranowski, Joshua J. P. Thompson, Zhuo Yang, Martha Rivera Medina, Maria Antonietta Loi, Ermin Malic, Paulina Plochocka
Abstract: A comprehensive study of excitonic properties of 2D layered perovskites is provided, with an emphasis on understanding and controlling the exciton fine structure. First, an overview of the optical properties is presented, discussing the challenges in determining the bandgap and exciton binding energies. Through magneto-optical spectroscopic measurements (up to B = 140 T), scaling laws are established for exciton binding energy as a function of the band gap and the diamagnetic coefficient. Using an in-plane magnetic field, the exciton fine structure for various 2D perovskites is examined to measure the energy splitting between the excitonic levels. The exciton fine structure and exchange interaction are correlated with structural parameters, employing an effective mass model, to highlight the role of steric effect on the exchange interaction. These findings reveal that lattice distortions, introduced by organic spacers, significantly influence the exchange interaction, driving a tunable energy spacing between dark and bright excitons. This unique feature of 2D perovskites, not present in other semiconductors, offers a novel tuning mechanism for exciton control, making these materials highly promising for efficient light emitters and advanced quantum technologies.

Title: Ferromagnetism and structural phase transition in rhombohedral PrIr3
Authors: Karolina Gornicka, Michal J. Winiarski, Robert J. Cava, Michael A. McGuire, Tomasz Klimczuk
Abstract: The synthesis, structural, magnetic, thermal and transport properties are reported for polycrystalline PrIr3. At room temperature PrIr3 displays the rhombohedral space group R-3m and a PuNi3- type structure. At around 70 K a phase transition to a monoclinic C2/m structure is observed and continued cooling reveals temperature independent behavior of the unit cell volume. Further, PrIr3 undergoes a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition with T_C = 7.5 K. The temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility follows the Curie Weiss law with a positive Curie-Weiss temperature, and an effective moment that is close to the theoretical effective moment for a free Pr+3 ion. This introduces further complexity into the behavior of PuNi3 - type materials and highlights the importance of temperature-dependent structural studies to complement physical property measurements in intermetallic compounds.

Title: Perfectly harmonic spin cycloid and multi-$Q$ textures in the Weyl semimetal GdAlSi
Authors: Ryota Nakano, Rinsuke Yamada, Juba Bouaziz, Maurice Colling, Masaki Gen, Kentaro Shoriki, Yoshihiro Okamura, Akiko Kikkawa, Hiroyuki Ohsumi, Yoshikazu Tanaka, Hajime Sagayama, Hironori Nakao, Yasujiro Taguchi, Youtarou Takahashi, Masashi Tokunaga, Taka-hisa Arima, Yoshinori Tokura, Ryotaro Arita, Jan Masell, Satoru Hayami, Max Hirschberger
Abstract: A fundamental question concerns how topological electronic states are influenced by many-body correlations, and magnetic Weyl semimetals represent an important material platform to address this problem. However, the magnetic structures realized in these materials are limited, and in particular, no clear example of an undistorted helimagnetic state has been definitively identified. Here, we report clear evidence of a harmonic helimagnetic cycloid with an incommensurate magnetic propagation vector in the Weyl semimetal GdAlSi via resonant elastic X-ray scattering, including rigorous polarization analysis. This cycloidal structure is consistent with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction prescribed by the polar crystal structure of GdAlSi. Upon applying a magnetic field, the cycloid undergoes a transition to a novel multi-$Q$ state. This field-induced, noncoplanar texture is consistent with our numerical spin model, which incorporates the DM interaction and, crucially, anisotropic exchange. The perfectly harmonic Weyl helimagnet GdAlSi serves as a prototypical platform to study electronic correlation effects in periodically modulated Weyl semimetals.

Title: Exciton Annihilation by Lanthanide Dopants: An Atomic Probe of Sub-Diffraction Exciton Diffusion in Ferromagnetic CrI3
Authors: Kimo Pressler, Daniel R. Gamelin
Abstract: Excitons in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials offer unique windows into the properties of strongly correlated electrons. Their generation can be used to drive magnetic phase transitions, manipulate spins coherently, or access novel non-equilibrium regimes. Despite extensive investigation into the spin physics of CrI3, exciton dynamics in this archetypal magnetic 2D material remain underexplored. Here, we report the use of Yb3+ impurity point defects as exciton annihilators to probe exciton diffusion in CrI3. Variable-temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements for a series of x% Yb3+:CrI3 samples reveal thermally activated Dexter-type site-to-site hopping of excitons, with low exciton diffusivity associated with strong electron-nuclear coupling. Using Monte Carlo modeling calibrated by the experimental data, diffusivities are found to be orders of magnitudes lower than in 2D vdW semiconductors. Exciton diffusion lengths (LD) are below ~3 nm at all temperatures, and thus well below the optical diffraction limit. These results have basic implications for the use of excitons to probe and manipulate their surroundings in this and related magnetic CrX3 materials.

Title: Non-equilibrium field theory with a temperature gradient: Thermal current in a nanowire
Authors: Yuan Gao, K.A. Muttalib
Abstract: A perturbative framework is developed within the standard non-equilibrium field theory techniques to incorporate a temperature gradient across a thermoelectric device. The framework uses a temperature-dependent pseudo-Hamiltonian generated from the exact density matrix in the presence of non-uniform temperatures. We develop a perturbation theory for small temperature gradients in long wires and obtain the non-linear thermal conductance as a function of temperature difference. The framework should be adaptable to more general cases of temperature inhomogeneities in either fermionic or bosonic systems.

Title: Temperature inhomogeneity in non-equilibrium field theory for electrons in a nanowire: thermodynamic and transport properties
Authors: Yuan Gao, K.A. Muttalib
Abstract: A nanowire with its two ends fixed at two different temperatures by external baths is the simplest example of a fermionic system with a temperature inhomogeneity, and could be an easy platform to study thermodynamic and transport properties of a boundary-driven open quantum system. Starting with a temperature-dependent pseudo free energy derived from an exact reduced density matrix and assuming a small temperature gradient $\gamma$ across the wire, we show within perturbation theory that electron dispersion relation and therefore the Fermi distribution becomes $\gamma$ and space coordinates dependent, leading to non-linear effects of the temperature inhomogeneity. In particular, we show that in the non-linear response regime, the Widemann-Franz Law for the ratio of thermal and electrical conductivities is generalized, and that the thermopower increases with increasing temperature gradient $\gamma$.

Title: From anomalous diffusion in polygons to a transport locking relation
Authors: Luisana Claudio-Pachecano, Hernán Larralde, Carlos Mejía-Monasterio
Abstract: We study particle transport in a class of open channels of finite length, made of identical cells of connected open polygonal billiards with parallel boundaries. In these systems the Mean Square Displacement (MSD) grows in time faster than linearly. We show that irrespective of the geometry of these channels, the distribution of the first return times decays algebraically with two different exponents, separated by a crossover region that is determined by the MSD. We find that the distribution of first return times satisfies a simple scaling form. In turn, the transmission coefficient, defined as the fraction of trajectories that starting at the cell at the origin escape the channel through the other boundary, decays algebraically with the size of the system, and, as a signature of non-recurrent transport, sometimes slower. From these two processes we derive a locking relation among the scaling exponents for the asymptotic behavior of the MSD, the times of first return to the origin and the way transmission decays with the system size, showing that these three processes are interdependent. The locking relation holds for diffusive processes, as well as for fractional Brownian motion with arbitrary Hurst exponent. We argue that the locking relation may be valid for many other transport processes, Markovian or not, with finite MSD.

Title: Degradation of 2.4-kV $Ga_{2}O_{3}$ Schottky Barrier Diode at High Temperatures up to 500 °C
Authors: Hunter Ellis, Wei Jia, Imteaz Rahaman, Apostoli Hillas, Botong Li, Michael A. Scarpulla, Berardi Sensale Rodriguez, Kai Fu
Abstract: Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes featuring a field plate and a composite SiO2/SiNx dielectric layer beneath the field plate were fabricated, achieving a breakdown voltage of 2.4 kV at room temperature. Electrical performance and degradation were analyzed via I-V and C-V measurements from 25 °C to 500 °C, revealing temperature-dependent transport, interface stability, and device stability. Upon returning to room temperature, the diodes exhibited nearly unchanged forward characteristics, while the breakdown voltage declined significantly from 2.4 kV to 700 V. This behavior indicates a temperature-induced reduction in the barrier height. Detailed analysis revealed that variable range hopping (VRH) dominated the leakage mechanism at moderate temperatures, while thermal emission (TE) became increasingly significant at temperatures exceeding 400 °C.

Title: Elasticity of a Freely Jointed Chain with Quenched Disorder
Authors: Minsu Yi, Panayotis Benetatos
Abstract: We introduce a simple theoretical model, the Freely Jointed Chain with quenched hinges (qFJC), which captures the quenched disorder in the local bending stiffness of the polymer. In this article, we analyze the tensile elasticity of the qFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. For finite-size systems, we obtain a recurrence relation of the exact free energy, which allows us to calculate the exact force-extension relation numerically for an arbitrary size of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, when $L({\rm contour \;length})\gg L_p({\rm persistence \;length})$, we obtain a framework to deal with quenched disorder in the polymer configuration. This allows us to obtain the response function for the discrete and continuous qFJC in the thermodynamic limit. It turns out that the extension of the continuous qFJC can be cast in a simple form. Furthermore, we have applied our analysis to rod-coil multiblock copolymers.

Title: On the planar impact of a disc and a square particle considering the impact angle and particle orientation
Authors: Dominik Krengel
Abstract: Despite the simple impact of a rigid particle being a centuries old problem, a conclusive treatment of the general case is still outstanding. The influences of particle shape as well as elastic and plastic deformation of the particle upon contact significantly complicate the problem. Experiments have shown the possibilities of backward movement as well as forward movement with backward rotation after an impact. This paper investigates the planar impact of a disc and square particle under systematic consideration of the impact angle and initial particle orientation. We investigate the kinematic variables of the particle both post-impact as well as their evolution during contact. For impacts with friction, we find oscillatory behaviour of the tangential contact force in both discs and squares depending on the impact angle and particle orientation. We further demonstrate the possibility of backwards deflection for square particles with backward orientation under steep impact angles, which is not possible for round particles under the same conditions. In contrast, high deflection angles are achieved with a kind of "double-impact" where the centroid of the particle moves away from the plane so that the surface detaches first, but reconnects again due to induced rotation, which also is not possible for round particles. Lastly, we present different coefficients of restitution for the square particle with respect to the combined influence of impact angle and particle orientation upon impact.

Title: Electric-field-induced fully-compensated ferrimagnetism in experimentally synthesized monolayer MnSe
Authors: Liguo Zhang, San-Dong Guo, Gangqiang Zhu
Abstract: Owing to their inherent characteristics of zero stray field and terahertz dynamics, two-dimensional (2D) zero-net-magnetization magnets demonstrate the potential for miniaturization, ultradensity and ultrafast performance. Recently, fully-compensated ferrimagnet of 2D zero-net-magnetization magnets has already attracted attention, as it can exhibit global spin-splitting, magneto-optical response and anomalous Hall effect [\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 116703 (2025)}]. Therefore, it is very important to provide experimentally feasible strategies and materials to achieve fully-compensated ferrimagnets. Here, we use the experimentally synthesized A-type $PT$-antiferromagnet (the joint symmetry ($PT$) of space inversion symmetry ($P$) and time-reversal symmetry ($T$)) MnSe as the parent material to induce fully-compensated ferrimagnetism through an out-of-plane electric field. This electric field can remove the $P$ symmetry of the lattice, thereby breaking the $PT$ symmetry and inducing spin-splitting. When considering spin-orbital coupling (SOC), MnSe with an out-of-plane magnetization can achieve the anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). In addition, we also discuss inducing fully-compensated ferromagnetism via Se vacancies and Janus engineering. Our works can promote the further development of 2D fully-compensated ferrimagnets both theoretically and experimentally.

Title: SALMON VR: Visualizing Light-Matter Dynamics
Authors: Tomohito Otobe, Tatsuya Ogusu, Mizuki Tani, Shunsuke Yamada
Abstract: This study presents SALMON VR, a visualization program designed to visualize the time evolution of electronic density changes and vector potentials in virtual reality (VR) space. The time-series electronic density data computed by SALMON are stored in CUBE format. SALMON VR processes these data to construct isosurfaces of electronic density variations and two-dimensional representations of vector potentials. Equipped with a user-friendly interface using VR technology, the program is available in two versions: one for the Meta Quest 3 head-mount display (Meta Platforms Inc., California) and one for PCs. Atoms are displayed as spheres of different sizes and colors according to their elemental properties. This visual representation facilitates a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between light and electrons. Users can easily manipulate the isosurface values, speed of animation, and color map of the vector potential. SALMON VR will enable researchers and educators to enhance their understanding of physical phenomena and improve engagement in learning environments.

Title: Observation of thermally activated coherent magnon-magnon coupling in a magnonic hybrid system
Authors: Dinesh Wagle, Yi Li, Mojtaba Taghipour Kaffash, Sergi Lendinez, Mohammad Tomal Hossain, Valentine Novosad, M. Benjamin Jungfleisch
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate strong magnon-magnon coupling by thermal spin excitations in yttrium iron garnet/permalloy (YIG/Py) hybrid structures using microfocused Brillouin light scattering - an optical technique that enables the detection of zero-wavevector and higher-order wavevector spin waves in a broad frequency range. The thermally activated magnons in the bilayer lead to a hybrid excitation between magnon modes in the conductive Py layer with a wide wavevector range and the first perpendicular standing magnon modes in the insulating YIG layer, facilitated by strong interfacial exchange coupling. To further investigate this coupling, we compare the thermal magnon spectra with the results obtained from electrical excitation and detection methods, which primarily detect the uniform Py mode. The realization of coherent coupling between incoherent (thermal) magnons is important for advancing energy-efficient magnonic devices, particularly in classical as well as quantum spin-wave computing technologies.

Title: Chemical Foundation Model Guided Design of High Ionic Conductivity Electrolyte Formulations
Authors: Murtaza Zohair, Vidushi Sharma, Eduardo A. Soares, Khanh Nguyen, Maxwell Giammona, Linda Sundberg, Andy Tek, Emilio A. V. Vital, Young-Hye La
Abstract: Designing optimal formulations is a major challenge in developing electrolytes for the next generation of rechargeable batteries due to the vast combinatorial design space and complex interplay between multiple constituents. Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful tool to uncover underlying chemical design rules and accelerate the process of formulation discovery. In this work, we present an approach to design new formulations that can achieve target performance, using a generalizable chemical foundation model. The chemical foundation model is fine-tuned on an experimental dataset of 13,666 ionic conductivity values curated from the lithium-ion battery literature. The fine-tuned model is used to discover 7 novel high conductivity electrolyte formulations through generative screening, improving the conductivity of LiFSI and LiDFOB based electrolytes by 82% and 172%, respectively. These findings highlight a generalizable workflow that is highly adaptable to the discovery of chemical mixtures with tailored properties to address challenges in energy storage and beyond.

Title: Cooperative atomic motion during shear deformation in metallic glass
Authors: Yoshinori Shiihara, Takuya Iwashita, Nozomu Adachi, Yoshikazu Todaka, Takeshi Egami
Abstract: Elucidating mechanical deformation in glassy materials at the atomic level is challenging due to their disordered atomic structure. Using our novel "frozen atom analysis," we reveal that anelastic deformation in CuZr metallic glasses is fundamentally driven by cooperative atomic motions of approximately 40 elastically linked atoms, forming trigger groups. They initiate localized rearrangements, which can cascade into plastic flow. Notably, these groups show no distinct structural or physical features, challenging the idea that deformation occurs in defective regions. Instead, deformation events are highly stochastic and transient, driven by collective atomic motion. This finding not only reshapes our understanding of glassy material deformation mechanisms but also highlights cooperative motion as a key factor in avalanche-like phenomena governing the behavior of disordered systems across multiple scales.

Title: Evolving transport properties of dynamic hydrogels enable self-tuning of short- and long-term cargo delivery
Authors: Samya Sen, Changxin Dong, Carolyn K. Jons, Ye Eun Song, Alexander N. Prossnitz, Eric A. Appel
Abstract: Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer networks with high water content widely utilized in biomedical applications. Injectable depot-forming hydrogels for drug delivery offer sustained release of biomolecular cargo, leveraging controlled macromolecular diffusion within dynamic networks to promote extended immunity and favorable immunological responses. However, mitigating burst release while maintaining sustained-release properties remains a challenge due to network disruption during needle extrusion, leading to excessive short-term cargo release and local toxicity. While controlling both short- and long-term release profiles would mitigate this issue, it remains a persistent challenge. Here, we present a hydrogel formulation strategy for self-regulating, post-injection network evolution enabled by exchange of functional molecules with physiological environment, achieving controlled cargo release over both short and long durations. By tuning network viscoelasticity, we optimized rheological properties to minimize burst release while preserving sustained-release profiles. Using model protein cargo, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated reduced burst release and comparable sustained-release to unmodified control formulations. These findings highlight a novel strategy for precise cargo delivery in biomedical applications.

Title: Error Bounds on the Universal Lindblad Equation in the Thermodynamic Limit
Authors: Teruhiro Ikeuchi, Takashi Mori
Abstract: It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors due to several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation keep small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of the accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Intumescent Polymer-Particle Hydrogels Expand the Retardancy Window for Wildfire Defense
Authors: Changxin Dong, Samya Sen, Zhennan Ru, Athena Kolli, Paxton S. Appel, Eric A. Appel
Abstract: The 2025 Los Angeles wildfires caused widespread urban destruction and displacement, and severe economic losses, highlighting the urgent need for better fire retardants. Current fire suppression strategies rely heavily on water, chemical fire retardants, and water-enhancing gels, which use superabsorbent polymers to retain water and adhere to substrates, offering extended fire protection compared to water alone. However, their effectiveness is limited by evaporation and degradation under extreme heat and wind conditions. This study investigates the thermal properties, evaporation dynamics, and fire retardancy mechanisms of a novel polymer-particle (PP) hydrogel with aerogel-forming capabilities. Using a combination of retardancy tests, thermal analysis and modeling, rheological characterization, porosity analysis, and electron microscopy, we analyze how the gelation mechanism, polymer network integrity, and physical interactions of cellulose chains with colloidal silica particles influence fire retardancy and intumescent response. The boiling-induced water vapor expansion and bubble nucleation drive the transformation of the hydrogel into a highly porous, large-volume fire-retardant dome upon rapid heat desiccation, enhancing thermal insulation. By evaluating the retardancy window across different evaporation stages under high heat and wind conditions, this study aims to determine the duration, effectiveness, and governing physical mechanisms of this unique retardant system. These findings provide a framework for designing the next generation of fire retardants with optimized thermal stability and extended protection for wildfire mitigation.

Title: Effect of substitution La by Mg on electrochemical and electronic properties in La$_{2-x}$Mg$_x$Ni$_7$ alloys: a combined experimental and ab initio studies
Authors: Mirosław Werwiński (1), Andrzej Szajek (1), Agnieszka Marczyńska (1), Lesław Smardz (1), Marek Nowak (2), Mieczysław Jurczyk (2) ((1) Institute of Molecular Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznań, Poland, (2) Institute of Materials Science and Engineering, Poznań University of Technology, Poznań, Poland)
Abstract: La-Mg-Ni-based alloys are promising negative electrode materials for 3rd generation of Ni-MH$_x$ batteries. In this work, we investigate the effect of Mg substitution on the electrochemical and electronic properties of La$_{2-x}$Mg$_x$Ni$_7$ materials. The mechanical alloying technique is used to produce a series of La$_{2-x}$Mg$_x$Ni$_7$ alloys ($x$ = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75). The X-ray diffraction measurements indicate multiphase character of the samples with majority (La,Mg)$_2$Ni$_7$ phases of hexagonal Ce$_2$Ni$_7$-type and rhombohedral Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type. Electrochemical measurements show how the maximum discharge capacity ($C_{max}$) increases with Mg concentration and that reach the highest value of 304 mAh/g for La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ ($x$ = 0.5). The experimental efforts are followed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed with the full-potential local-orbital minimum-basis scheme (FPLO). To simulate chemical disorder, we use the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The calculations are focused on the La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ composition with the highest measured value of $C_{max}$. Additionally, several other structures are considered as reference points. We find that hexagonal and rhombohedral structures of La$_2$Ni$_7$ have almost identical total energies, which is in a good agreement with a coexistence of both phases in the samples. The calculated site preferences of Mg in both Ce$_2$Ni$_7$-type and Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ phases are consistent with the previous experimental data. Furthermore, the valence band of the nanocrystalline La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ sample is investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The experimental XPS are interpreted based on the corresponding spectra calculated with DFT.

Title: Band gaps and phonons of quasi-bulk rocksalt ScN
Authors: J. Grümbel, Y. Oshima, A. Dubroka, M. Ramsteiner, R. Goldhahn, M. Feneberg
Abstract: ScN is an emerging transition metal nitride with unique physical properties arising from the d-electrons of Sc. In this work we present the results of optical characterization techniques spectroscopic ellipsometry, Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence measurements of a 40 $\mu$m thick, fully relaxed, and only weakly n-type doped ($n = 1.2 \times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$) ScN film deposited by halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) on r-sapphire substrate. Spectroscopic ellipsometry yields an indirect bandgap of 1.1 eV while the lowest direct interband transition is observed at $E_\mathrm{g,opt} = $ 2.16 eV in the dielectric function. A broad luminescence feature at 2.15 eV is observed, matching this transition. We derive an estimate for the exciton binding energy ($E_{bX}\approx $14 meV) as well as the Born effective charges $Z_\mathrm{Sc}^* = -Z_\mathrm{N}^* = 3.78$. In the infrared spectral region we observe a strong phonon and a weak plasmon absorption. We precisely determine the transverse optical phonon eigenfrequency ($\omega_\mathrm{TO} = $340.7 cm$^{-1}$), the high frequency dielectric constant ($\varepsilon_\infty = 8.3$) and the static dielectric constant ($\varepsilon_\mathrm{stat} = 29.5$). Raman measurements using various excitation energies show resonant multi-phonon scattering up to 6LO (6th order overtone for longitudinal optical (LO) phonons) for excitation above the optical band gap ($E_\mathrm{Laser} > E_\mathrm{g,opt}$), where the allowed 2LO scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism for all excitation energies. Their characteristic parameters determined from Lorentzian line shape fitting yield $\omega_\mathrm{LO} = $681 cm$^{-1}$ and an increased broadening and reduced asymmetry for higher LO scattering order $n$.

Title: Effect of Gd and Co content on electrochemical and electronic properties of La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ alloys: a combined experimental and first-principles study
Authors: Mirosław Werwiński (1), Andrzej Szajek (1), Agnieszka Marczyńska (1), Lesław Smardz (1), Marek Nowak (2), Mieczysław Jurczyk (2) ((1) Institute of Molecular Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznań, Poland, (2) Institute of Materials Science and Engineering, Poznań University of Technology, Poznań, Poland)
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effect of Gd and Co substitutions on the electrochemical and electronic properties of La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ alloy. Two series of La$_{1.5-x}$Gd$_x$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ ($x$ = 0.0, 0.25, 1.0) and La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_{7-y}$Co$_y$ ($y$ = 0.0, 0.5, 1.5) alloys are produced using mechanical alloying technique. The X-ray diffraction indicates multiphase character of the samples, with the majority of hexagonal Ce$_2$Ni$_7$-type and rhombohedral Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type structures of (La,Mg)$_2$Ni$_7$ phase. Partial substitutions of La by Gd or Ni by Co in La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ phase result in increase of cycle stability of the metal hydride (MH$_x$) electrodes. All considered alloys reach the maximum discharge capacity after three charging-discharging cycles. Two optimal compositions, in respect of electrochemical properties, are subsequently investigated by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The experimental analysis of the valence band is further extended by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We also discuss the effects of alloying and site preference of dopants on the position of the van Hove-type singularity, as observed in the electronic densities of states (DOS) in proximity of the Fermi level.

Title: Ideal Weyl fermions and double Kagome bands in a series of distorted armchair-type all-$\emph{sp}^{2}$ carbon networks
Authors: Yun-Yun Bai, Yan Gao, Weikang Wu, Yong Liu, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: The study of the Weyl fermions and Kagome bands has recently attracted significant attention in condensed matter physics. However, realizing of perfect Weyl semimetals and double Kagome bands remains challenging. Here, we report a new class of distorted armchair-type fully sp2-hybridized carbon networks, termed DACN-n. The DACN-n family is characterized by only six pairs of Weyl points on the $k_z=0$ plane near the Fermi level. We calculated the chirality of these Weyl points and found that each carries a topological charge of $\pm$1. Notably, DACN-5 exhibits a double Kagome band, where the Weyl points arise from the intersection between Dirac-type bands in the two sets of Kagome bands. The structural stability of DACN-n is confirmed by phonon spectra, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and elastic constant calculations. Additionally, we investigated the surface states of the (001) surface and found that its nontrivial topological properties are attributed to the Fermi arcs connecting a pair of Weyl points with opposite chirality. We also simulated x-ray diffraction patterns to guide experimental synthesis. Our findings not only present a new family of three-dimensional carbon allotropes, but also provide a unique opportunity for exploring ideal Weyl fermions and double Kagome bands.

Title: Chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa criticality: honeycomb vs. SLAC fermions
Authors: Thomas C. Lang, Andreas M. Läuchli
Abstract: We perform large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model at half filling with a single Dirac cone close to the critical point, which separates a Dirac semi-metal from an antiferromagnetically ordered phase where SU(2) spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken. We discuss the implementation of a single Dirac cone in the SLAC formulation for eight Dirac components and the influence of dynamically induced long-range super-exchange interactions. The finite size behavior of dimensionless ratios and the finite size scaling properties of the Hubbard model with a single Dirac cone are shown to be superior compared to the honeycomb lattice. We extract the critical exponent believed to belong to the chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa universality class: The critical exponent ${\nu = 1.02(3)}$ coincides for the two lattice types once honeycomb lattices of linear dimension ${L\ge 15}$ are considered. In contrast to the SLAC formulation, where the anomalous dimensions are estimated to be ${\eta_{\phi}=0.73(1)}$ and ${\eta_{\psi}=0.09(1)}$, they remain less stable on honeycomb lattices, but tend towards the estimates from the SLAC formulation.

Title: The crucial role of substrate in FeSe/STO: new insights to interface-driven superconductivity from first-principles
Authors: Riccardo Reho, Arnold H. Kole, Nils Wittemeier, Andrés R. Botello-Méndez, Zeila Zanolli
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting properties of monolayer FeSe, both freestanding (ML FeSe) and on SrTiO$_3$ (STO), by simultaneously solving the Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory and Bogoliubov--de Gennes equations. Our results demonstrate that the substrate profoundly alters both the normal-state and superconducting properties of FeSe. We identify proximity-induced superconductivity in the interfacial TiO$_2$ layer of STO, due to hybridization between Fe $d$ and O $p$ orbitals. This hybridization results in a fivefold increase in the superconducting gap width and confines superconducting states to the $M$ point in the Brillouin Zone. This is in contrast to ML FeSe, where superconductivity emerges at both the $\Gamma$ and $M$ points. Furthermore, the substrate modifies the orbital character of the states responsible for superconductivity, which change from Fe $d_{z^2}$ in ML FeSe to Fe $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ in FeSe/STO. In both systems, we demonstrate an anisotropic superconducting gap with multiple coherence peaks, originating at different k-points in the Brillouin Zone. Additionally, in FeSe/STO, we identify emerging states unique to the superconducting phase arising from electron-hole hybridization at $M$, in agreement with experiments. Our findings highlight the decisive impact of substrate (hybridization, strain, charge transfer, magnetic order) on the superconducting properties of FeSe. We suggest potential pathways for engineering novel high-temperature FeSe-based superconductors by leveraging interfacial interactions in substrates with high electron affinity.

Title: Exact calculation of spectral properties of a particle interacting with a one-dimensional Fermi gas in optical lattices
Authors: Xia-Ji Liu, Hui Hu
Abstract: By using the exact Bethe wavefunctions of the one-dimensional Hubbard model with $N$ spin-up fermions and one spin-down impurity, we derive an analytic expression of the impurity form factor, in the form of a determinant of a $(N+1)$ by $(N+1)$ matrix. This analytic expression enables us to exactly calculate spectral properties of one-dimensional Fermi polarons in lattices, when the masses of the impurity particle and the Fermi bath are equal. We present the impurity spectral function as functions of the on-site interaction strength and the filling factor of the Fermi bath, and discuss the origin of Fermi singularities in the spectral function at small momentum and the emergence of polaron quasiparticles at large momentum near the boundary of Brillouin zone. Our analytic expression of the impurity form factors pave the way to exploring the intriguing dynamics of a particle interacting with a Fermi bath. Our exact predictions on the impurity spectral function could be directly examined in cold-atom laboratories by using the radio-frequency spectroscopy and Ramsey spectroscopy.

Title: Tunable Anomalous Diffusion in Subrecoil-Laser-Cooled Atoms
Authors: Soma Shiraki, Eli Barkai, Takuma Akimoto
Abstract: The control of atomic motion through laser cooling has revolutionized quantum technologies, enabling applications ranging from quantum computing to precision metrology. However, the spatial spreading of subrecoil-laser-cooled atoms -- crucial for understanding cooling mechanisms and atomic confinement -- remains largely unexplored. Here, we analyze anomalous diffusion in subrecoil-laser-cooled atoms, where a velocity-dependent fluorescence rate $R(v) \propto |v|^{\alpha}$ governs transport properties. By tuning $\alpha$, we uncover transitions between normal, subdiffusive, and superdiffusive regimes. Notably, at $\alpha = 3/2$, diffusion is minimized, leading to optimal atomic confinement. These findings advance the understanding of anomalous transport in laser-cooled systems and offer new avenues for precise control of atomic motion.

Title: Transition from $s_{\pm}$-wave to $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave superconductivity driven by interlayer interaction in the bilayer two-orbital model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Wenhan Xi, Shun-Li Yu, Jian-Xin Li
Abstract: We utilize the fluctuation-exchange approximation on a bilayer two-orbital model, incorporating $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, to explore potential pairing symmetries in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our study particularly examines the impact of interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of these interactions, the superconducting gap exhibits $s_{\pm}$-wave symmetry, with predominant intraorbital pairing in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. As interlayer interactions increase, $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity is suppressed, while the superconductivity with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap is enhanced, resulting in a transition at a critical interaction strength. This $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is distinct not only from the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity but also from the intraorbital $d$-wave pairing in cuprate superconductors, as it is dominated by the interlayer pairing between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Additionally, charge fluctuations play a crucial role in driving the transition from $s_{\pm}$ wave to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave superconductivity. Our findings indicate that interlayer Coulomb interactions are crucial for understanding the pairing mechanism in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Lis (2) ((1) Institute of Molecular Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznań, Poland, (2) Adam Mickiewicz University, Faculty of Chemistry, Department of Rare Earths, Poznań, Poland)
Abstract: High-pressure induced structural transition from zircon-type phase into scheelite-type phase in YVO$_4$ is studied using ab initio calculations. Several structures with compressed volumes are evaluated, where for every considered volume the c/a ratio and atomic positions are optimised. The transition pressure and transition volume change are calculated. The reports on YVO$_4$ electronic structure and electronic band gap behaviour are followed by results of X-Ray photoemission spectra XPS calculations. Most of our theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results taken from literature.

Title: Beating stripe solitons arising from helicoidal spin-orbit coupling in Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Cui-Cui Ding, Qin Zhou, B. A. Malomed
Abstract: We demonstrate that the model of a spatially non-uniform two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) featuring the helicoidal spin-orbit coupling (SOC), gives rise to dark-bright soliton complexes characterized by spatiotemporal periodic oscillations in each component. These solitons are formed by the superposition of dark and bright ones, and exhibit a beating state over time and a striped state across space, earning them the designation of beating stripe solitons. Our analysis demonstrates that helicoidal SOC significantly affects the formation and dynamical properties of these solitons, also serving as the primary driver for spin oscillations. Through the nonlinear superposition of the beating stripe solitons, a range of intricate scenarios of the interaction between multiple solitons emerges, including head-on collisions, bound states, and parallel states.

Title: Exponentially Tilted Thermodynamic Maps (expTM): Predicting Phase Transitions Across Temperature, Pressure, and Chemical Potential
Authors: Suemin Lee, Ruiyu Wang, Lukas Herron, Pratyush Tiwary
Abstract: Predicting and characterizing phase transitions is crucial for understanding generic physical phenomena such as crystallization, protein folding and others. However, directly observing phase transitions is not always easy, and often one has limited observations far from the phase boundary and measured under some specific thermodynamic conditions. In this study, we propose a statistical physics and Generative AI driven framework that can take such limited information to generate samples of different phases under arbitrary thermodynamic conditions, which we name Exponentially Tilted Thermodynamic Maps (expTM). The central idea is to map collected data into a tractable simple prior expressed as an exponentially tilted Gaussian. We demonstrate how the variance and mean of the prior can be correlated with pairs of thermodynamic control variables, including temperature, pressure, and chemical potential. This gives us the ability to generate thermodynamically correct samples under any values of the control variables. To demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach, we use expTM to sample the lattice gas models with the Grand Canonical ensemble, capturing phase transitions under varying chemical potentials and temperatures. We further demonstrate how expTM can model the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, with which we predict different phases of CO2 under varying pressure conditions. Both examples are trained on very limited data far from the phase boundary. These results establish expTM as a robust tool for understanding phase transitions across diverse thermodynamic conditions requiring only a small number of observations.

Title: Superconducting diode effect in Ising superconductors
Authors: Itai Bankier, Lotan Attias, Alex Levchenko, Maxim Khodas
Abstract: We study the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in an Ising superconductor with broken basal mirror symmetry in a parallel magnetic field. We show that in the presence of a small Rashba spin splitting, $\Delta_R$, the dominant Ising spin-orbit coupling ($\Delta_I >> \Delta_R$) dramatically enhances the SDE efficiency compared to a Rashba superconductor with $\Delta_I = 0$ and the same $\Delta_R$. The suppression of the SDE for $\Delta_I = 0$ at $\Delta_R$ much larger than the critical temperature ($T_c$) is accidental. At $\Delta_R << T_c$, the SDE efficiency is small because, to linear order, $\Delta_R$ can be removed by a gauge transformation. These two factors -- the accidental suppression of the SDE at large $\Delta_R$ and the systematic suppression at small $\Delta_R$ -- are eliminated by Ising spin-orbit coupling. As a result, SDE efficiency is substantially enhanced for $\Delta_I >> \Delta_R \neq 0$.

Title: Image of helical local moment magnetic order in the STM spectrum
Authors: Alireza Akbari, Peter Thalmeier
Abstract: The surface tunneling microscope (STM) method probes the itinerant conduction electron spectrum which is influenced by the presence of collective order parameters. It may in fact be used as a tool to obtain important information about their microscopic nature, for example the gap symmetry in unconventional superconductors. Surprisingly it has been found that the STM spectrum can also identify magnetic order of completely localised electrons, e.g., incommensurate helical structure of 4f electron moments, as observed in the compound GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. This is due to the fact that the exchange coupling of conduction states to the localised subsystem reconstructs the itinerant bands which then leaves an imprint on the STM spectrum. We develop a theory based on this idea that shows firstly the appearance of STM satellite peaks at the wave vector of localised moment helical order for the pure surface. Secondly we derive the quasiparticle interference spectrum in Born approximation due to the presence of surface impurities which contains information on the reconstruction process of itinerant states caused by the localised helical order. Furthermore we show that within full $t$-matrix approach impurity bound states are also influenced by the exchange coupling to helical magnetic order.

Title: Ab initio investigation of electronic and lattice properties of Fe$_4$(P$_2$O$_7$)$_3$
Authors: Svitlana Pastukh, Pawel T. Jochym, Jan Lazewski, Dominik Legut, Przemyslaw Piekarz
Abstract: In this research, we examine the electronic, magnetic, and lattice properties of the Fe$_4$(P$_2$O$_7$)$_3$ compound using the first principles calculations based on the density functional theory. The crystal lattice has a monoclinic structure, belonging to the P$2_1/n$ space group. The optimized lattice parameters are a=7.406 Å, b=21.425 Å, c=9.529 Å, and agree very well with the experimental data, thanks to the local Coulomb interactions and van der Waals forces included in the calculations. The investigation considers several magnetic orderings. The lowest total energy was found for the antiferromagnetic configuration with the magnetic moment of $\sim4.6~\mu_{\text{B}}$ per Fe atom. The electronic structure calculation shows the Mott insulating state with the energy gap $E_g=2.87$~eV. For the relaxed crystal structure, the elastic properties were obtained and analyzed. The phonon dispersion relations and density of states were calculated within the temperature-dependent effective potential methodusing atomic multidisplacements obtained by high efficiency configuration space sampling.

Title: Electrically switchable non-relativistic Zeeman spin splittings in collinear antiferromagnets
Authors: Longju Yu, Hong Jian Zhao, Laurent Bellaiche, Yanming Ma
Abstract: Magnetic or electrical manipulation of electronic spin is elementary for spin-based logic, computing, and memory, where the latter is a low-power manipulation scheme. Rashba-like spin splittings stemming from spin-orbit interaction (SOI) enable electric-field manipulation of spin, but the relativistic SOI causes spin relaxations and yields dissipative transport of spin-encoded information. Recent works suggest the occurrence of electric-field switchable non-relativistic Zeeman spin splittings (NRZSSs) in collinear antiferromagnets -- allowing for electrical manipulation of spin in the non-relativistic regime; yet, a theory elucidating the mechanisms for these NRZSSs and guiding the materials discovery remains missing. Here, we develop such a theory by analyzing the symmetries of spin point groups. We highlight the linear magnetoelectric and bilinear piezomagnetoelectric mechanisms for NRZSSs that depend linearly on electric field and are electrically switchable. First-principles calculations further confirm that LiMnPO$_4$ and NaMnP showcase such NRZSSs. Our theory provides guidelines for discovering light-element collinear antiferromagnets with electrically switchable NRZSSs, which are promising for the design of high-performance spin-based devices.

Title: Controlled Diagonal Catalyst Improves the Efficiency of Quantum Annealing
Authors: Tomohiro Hattori, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. It searches for the ground state of the Ising model, which corresponds to the optimal solution of a given combinatorial optimization problem. The guiding principle of quantum annealing is the adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics, which guarantees that a system remains in the ground state of its Hamiltonian if the time evolution is sufficiently slow. According to the adiabatic theorem, the runtime required for quantum annealing to satisfy the adiabaticity scales is inverse to the square of the minimum energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state during time evolution. As a result, finding the ground state becomes significantly more difficult when the energy gap is small, creating a major bottleneck in quantum annealing. Expanding the energy gap is one strategy to improve the performance of quantum annealing; however, its implementation in actual hardware remains challenging. This study proposes a method for efficiently solving instances with small energy gaps by introducing additional local terms to the Hamiltonian and exploiting the diabatic transition remaining in the small energy gap. The proposed method achieves an approximate square speed up in time-to-solution compared to the conventional quantum annealing. In addition, we investigate the transferability of the parameters obtained with the proposed method.

Title: Determination of Electron Extraction in Semiconductor Photoanodes: Steady-state and Small-perturbation Response
Authors: Paola Ragonese, Chiara Maurizio, Boris Kalinic, Thomas Kirchartz, Sandheep Ravishankar
Abstract: This work develops an analytical model to consistently interpret the steady-state and small-perturbation response (both in the time and frequency domain) of photoanodes for solar water-splitting. In addition to accounting for the fundamental mechanisms of charge-carrier generation, recombination and slow hole transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, the model overcomes the key shortcomings of existing models in the literature. These include consistency across measurements/bias conditions and the non-consideration of imperfect electron extraction at the collecting contact and its corresponding effect on the recombination rate in the bulk. We applied the model to analyse the time constants obtained from intensity-modulated photocurrent (IMPS) and photovoltage (IMVS) measurements of a hematite photoanode, obtaining an electron extraction velocity of 100 cm/s close to the 1 sun open-circuit potential, that corresponds to an electron mobility of 0.022 cm2V-1s-1. The model further predicts a linear dependence of the photocurrent versus anodic voltage, an observation whose origin has been strongly debated in the literature in the case of hematite photoanodes. The generality of the model allows its extension to other photoanodes and photovoltaic systems, by the addition or removal of specific physical mechanisms.

Title: Fractional Brownian motion with mean-density interaction
Authors: Jonathan House, Skirmantas Janušonis, Ralf Metzler, Thomas Vojta
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion is a Gaussian stochastic process with long-range correlations in time; it has been shown to be a useful model of anomalous diffusion. Here, we investigate the effects of mutual interactions in an ensemble of particles undergoing fractional Brownian motion. Specifically, we introduce a mean-density interaction in which each particle in the ensemble is coupled to the gradient of the total, time-integrated density produced by the entire ensemble. We report the results of extensive computer simulations for the mean-square displacements and the probability densities of particles undergoing one-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with such a mean-density interaction. We find two qualitatively different regimes, depending on the anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha$ characterizing the fractional Gaussian noise. The motion is governed by the interactions for $\alpha < 4/3$ whereas it is dominated by the fractional Gaussian noise for $\alpha > 4/3$. We develop a scaling theory explaining our findings. We also discuss generalizations to higher space dimensions and nonlinear interactions as well as applications to the growth of strongly stochastic axons (e.g., serotonergic fibers) in vertebrate brains.

Title: Strong correlation between $H$-linear magnetoresistance and strange metal in FeSe superconductor
Authors: Xinyue Wang, Yue Sun, Wei Wei, Qiang Hou, Nan Zhou, Yufeng Zhang, Zhixiang Shi
Abstract: In strange metals, a strong and anomalous scattering effect exists and increases linearly with temperature. In FeSe, we observed that the temperature dependence of resistivity exhibits non-Fermi liquid behavior in two regions below and above a critical pressure, $p_\text{c}$$\sim$2 GPa. As pressure increases, a transition from quadratic to nonsaturating magnetoresistance is observed, with a distinct crossover between these two behaviors indicated by $B^{*}$ in the derivative analysis. After subtracting the quadratic term from the magnetoresistance, the residual magnetoresistance clearly exhibits an $H$-linear behavior. Additionally, two segments of $H$-inear magnetoresistance appear with increasing pressure, each arising from distinct origins. Notably, the two $H$-linear magnetoresistances exist and develop within the strange metal states. These results suggest that $H$-linear magnetoresistance is in strong correlation with the strange metal state, which may affect superconductivity in FeSe under pressure. Our study provides valuable insights into the strange metal state and clues for underlying unconventional superconductivity.

Title: Magneto-Raman effect in van der Waals layered two-dimensional CrSBr antiferromagnet
Authors: Urszula D. Wdowik, Vaibhav Varade, Jana Vejpravova, Dominik Legut
Abstract: Magneto-Raman spectroscopy is applied to study spin-phonon coupling in the layered two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr. We report on the effects of temperature and external magnetic field on Raman-active phonons of $A_g$ symmetry in bulk and one-to-six-layer forms of CrSBr that are reflected by the Raman spectral patterns measured at different configurations of circularly polarized laser beam. The results of experimental investigations reveal that spin-spin and spin-phonon interactions play a significant role below the Néel temperature and are notably stronger in CrSBr monolayer than in bulk material. Spin-phonon coupling leads to the emergence of \textit{ new} phonon peaks at very low temperatures. Such effect is solely observed in one-to-six-layer CrSBr and is absent in its bulk form. Our experimental research is accompanied by \textit{ab initio} simulations of the Raman spectra of bulk and monolayer CrSBr that uncover correlations between intensities of Raman-active phonons and the arrangement of spin magnetic moments on Cr atoms. Comparative analysis of simulated and experimental Raman spectra suggests the most favored spin orientation in the CrSBr antiferromagnetic system.

Title: Data-driven Azimuthal RHEED construction for in-situ crystal growth characterization
Authors: Abdourahman Khaireh-Walieh, Alexandre Arnoult, Sébastien Plissard, Peter R. Wiecha
Abstract: Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) is a powerful tool to probe the surface reconstruction during MBE growth. However, raw RHEED patterns are difficult to interpret, especially when the wafer is rotating. A more accessible representation of the information is therefore the so-called Azimuthal RHEED (ARHEED), an angularly resolved plot of the electron diffraction pattern during a full wafer rotation. However, ARHEED requires precise information about the rotation angle as well as of the position of the specular spot of the electron beam. We present a Deep Learning technique to automatically construct the Azimuthal RHEED from bare RHEED images, requiring no further measurement equipment. We use two artificial neural networks: an image segmentation model to track the center of the specular spot and a regression model to determine the orientation of the crystal with respect to the incident electron beam of the RHEED system. Our technique enables accurate and real-time ARHEED construction on any growth chamber equipped with a RHEED system.

Title: Halide Perovskites as Spin-1 Dirac Materials
Authors: Dmitry Marchenko, Maryam Sajedi, Maxim Krivenkov, Saleem Ayaz Khan, Andrei Varykhalov, Alexander Fedorov, Jaime Sánchez-Barriga, Daniel M. Többens, Thomas Unold, Ján Minár, Oliver Rader
Abstract: Halide perovskites are a promising class of materials for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications, exhibiting high power conversion efficiency due to strong light absorption and long carrier diffusion lengths. While various aspects of their crystal and electronic structure have been studied, we identify a fundamental property previously overlooked that may significantly impact their efficiency. We demonstrate that halide perovskites realize a three-dimensional (3D) Lieb lattice, giving rise to a gapped 3D Dirac cone of spin-1 fermions. This leads to a fivefold reduction in effective mass compared to a conventional cubic structure and suppressed carrier backscattering due to Klein tunneling. Our conclusions are supported by band structure calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy from CsPbBr$_3$ and CsSnBr$_3$. In particular, we reveal the transformation of the flat band of the Lieb lattice and the emergence of a dark corridor effect in photoemission from the Dirac cone, which increases as the band gap is decreased from CsPbBr$_3$ to CsSnBr$_3$.

Title: The importance of being empty: a spectral approach to Hopfield neural networks with diluted examples
Authors: Elena Agliari, Alberto Fachechi, Domenico Luongo
Abstract: We consider Hopfield networks, where neurons interact pair-wise by Hebbian couplings built over $i$. a set of definite patterns (ground truths), $ii$. a sample of labeled examples (supervised setting), $iii$. a sample of unlabeled examples (unsupervised setting). We focus on the case where ground-truths are Rademacher vectors and examples are noisy versions of these ground-truths, possibly displaying some blank entries (e.g., mimicking missing or dropped data), and we determine the spectral distribution of the coupling matrices in the three scenarios, by exploiting and extending the Marchenko-Pastur theorem. By levering this knowledge, we are able to analytically inspect the stability and attractiveness of the ground truths, as well as the generalization capabilities of the networks. In particular, as corroborated by long-running Monte Carlo simulations, the presence of black entries can have benefits in some specific conditions, suggesting strategies based on data sparsification; the robustness of these results in structured datasets is confirmed numerically. Finally, we demonstrate that the Hebbian matrix, built on sparse examples, can be recovered as the fixed point of a gradient descent algorithm with dropout, over a suitable loss function.

Title: Engineering interaction potentials for stabilizing quantum quasicrystal phases
Authors: Matheus Grossklags, Daniel Lima, Vinicius Zampronio, Fabio Cinti, Alejandro Mendoza-Coto
Abstract: We investigate the necessary features of the pair interaction for the stabilization of self-assembled quantum quasicrystals in two-dimensional bosonic systems. Unlike the classical scenario, our results show that two-dimensional octagonal, decagonal, and dodecagonal aperiodic phases require a distinct number of properly tuned characteristic length scales for their stabilization. By using a mean field spectral variational approach and Gross-Pitaevskii numerical calculations, we determine that the dodecagonal quasicrystal structure requires at least two characteristic length scales for its stabilization, while the decagonal and octagonal patterns need at least three and four length scales, respectively. The family of pair interaction potentials considered, albeit simple, is well justified in terms of a novel experimental platform based on laser-painted interactions in a cavity QED setup. Finally, we perform a structural characterization of the quasicrystal patterns obtained and show that these phases coexist with a finite superfluid fraction, forming what can be called a super quasicrystal phase.

Title: Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion in an annealed heterogeneous environment
Authors: Seongyu Park, Xavier Durang, Ralf Metzler, Jae-Hyung Jeon
Abstract: Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion is a ubiquitous phenomenon observed in various biological and soft matter systems. This anomalous dynamics is typically attributed to heterogeneous environments inducing spatiotemporal variations in the diffusivity of tracer particles. While previous studies have predominantly focused on systems exhibiting either spatial or temporal heterogeneity, this work bridges the gap by introducing a model based on an annealed extreme landscape to simultaneously account for both types of heterogeneities. Through a combination of computational analyses and analytical derivations, we investigate how the interplay of spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the energy landscape gives rise to Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the presence of temporal environmental fluctuations, the heterogeneous diffusion inevitably converges to classical Brownian motion via a homogenization process. We derive an analytical expression for the homogenization time as a function of key parameters governing the system's spatiotemporal heterogeneities. Additionally, we quantify particle-to-particle diffusion heterogeneity and examine the ergodic properties of this model, providing deeper insights into the dynamics of complex, heterogeneous systems.

Title: Quasi-$Φ_0$-periodic supercurrent at quantum Hall transitions
Authors: Ivan Villani, Matteo Carrega, Alessandro Crippa, Elia Strambini, Francesco Giazotto, Vaidotas Miseikis, Camilla Coletti, Fabio Beltram, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Stefan Heun, Sergio Pezzini
Abstract: The combination of superconductivity and quantum Hall (QH) effect is regarded as a key milestone in advancing topological quantum computation in solid-state systems. Recent quantum interference studies suggest that QH edge states can effectively mediate a supercurrent across high-quality graphene weak links. In this work we report the observation of a supercurrent associated with transitions between adjacent QH plateaus, where transport paths develop within the compressible two-dimensional bulk. We employ a back-gated graphene Josephson junction, comprising high-mobility CVD-grown graphene encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) and contacted by Nb leads. Superconducting pockets are detected persisting beyond the QH onset, up to 2.4 T, hence approaching the upper critical field of the Nb contacts. We observe an approximate $\Phi_0=h/2e$ periodicity of the QH-supercurrent as a function of the magnetic field, indicating superconducting interference in a proximitized percolative phase. These results provide a promising experimental platform to investigate the transport regime of percolative supercurrents, leveraging the flexibility of van der Waals devices.

Title: Simulation of current-driven magnetisation switching in nanopillars with Perpendicular Shape Anisotropy
Authors: Natalia Boscolo Meneguolo, Daria Gusakova, Jean-Christophe Toussaint, Mouad Fattouhi, Ioan-Lucian Prejbeanu, Olivier Fruchart
Abstract: The Perpendicular Shape Anisotropy Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (PSA-STT-MRAM) is a recent concept proposed to maintain the thermal stability of standard MRAM at small diameters, considering thick vertical pillars as the free layer. In order to explore the specific physics of PSA-STT-MRAMs expected in relation with their three-dimensional nature, we have performed simulations combining a micromagnetic model coupled self-consistently with spin-dependent transport equations. The 3D shape induces flower states at the upper and lower surfaces. Besides, the field-like component of STT is found to be larger than in standard MRAMs, suggesting that it needs to be considered. The combination of both effects leads to the excitation of high-order 3D ferromagnetic resonance modes, playing a key role in magnetisation reversal. These results highlight features of 3D nanomagnetic systems, largely disregarded so far, which need to be considered to optimise PSA-STT-MRAM to be a competitive solution for technological implementation.

Title: Revealing the proton slingshot mechanism in solid acid electrolytes through machine learning molecular dynamics
Authors: Menghang Wang, Jingxuan Ding, Grace Xiong, Ni Zhan, Cameron J. Owen, Albert Musaelian, Yu Xie, Nicola Molinari, Ryan P. Adams, Sossina Haile, Boris Kozinsky
Abstract: In solid acid solid electrolytes CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and CsHSO$_4$, mechanisms of fast proton conduction have long been debated and attributed to either local proton hopping or polyanion rotation. However, the precise role of polyanion rotation and its interplay with proton hopping remained unclear. Nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations, driven by equivariant neural network force fields, reveal a nuanced proton slingshot mechanism: protons are initially carried by rotating polyanions, followed by O$-$H bond reorientation, and the combined motion enables long-range jumps. This challenges the conventional revolving paddlewheel model and reveals significant independent proton motion that is assisted by limited rotations. Despite structural similarities, we identify qualitative differences in transport mechanisms between CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and CsHSO$_4$, caused by different proton concentrations. CsH$_2$PO$_4$ exhibits two distinct rates of rotational motions with different activation energies, contrasting with CsHSO$_4$'s single-rate behavior. The higher proton concentration in CsH$_2$PO$_4$ correlates with frustrated PO$_4$ polyanion orientations and slower rotations compared to SO$_4$ in CsHSO$_4$. Additionally, we reveal a correlation between O-sharing and proton transport in CsH$_2$PO$_4$, a unique feature due to extra proton per polyanion compared to CsHSO$_4$. Our findings suggest that reducing proton concentration could accelerate rotations and enhance conductivity. This work provides a unified framework for understanding and optimizing ionic mobility in solid-acid compounds, offering new insights into the interplay between proton hopping and disordered dynamics in polyanion rotation.

Title: Modeling crystal defects using defect-informed neural networks
Authors: Ziduo Yang, Xiaoqing Liu, Xiuying Zhang, Pengru Huang, Kostya S. Novoselov, Lei Shen
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized the study of crystalline materials for enabling rapid predictions and discovery. However, most AI-for-Materials research to date has focused on ideal crystals, whereas real-world materials inevitably contain defects that play a critical role in modern functional technologies. The defects and dopants break geometric symmetry and increase interaction complexity, posing particular challenges for traditional ML models. Addressing these challenges requires models that are able to capture sparse defect-driven effects in crystals while maintaining adaptability and precision. Here, we introduce Defect-Informed Equivariant Graph Neural Network (DefiNet), a model specifically designed to accurately capture defect-related interactions and geometric configurations in point-defect structures. Trained on 14,866 defect structures, DefiNet achieves highly accurate structural predictions in a single step, avoiding the time-consuming iterative processes in modern ML relaxation models and possible error accumulation from iteration. We further validates DefiNet's accuracy by using density functional theory (DFT) relaxation on DefiNet-predicted structures. For most defect structures, regardless of defect complexity or system size, only 3 ionic steps are required to reach the DFT-level ground state. Finally, comparisons with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images confirm DefiNet's scalability and extrapolation beyond point defects, positioning it as a groundbreaking tool for defect-focused materials research.

Title: Particle Pairing Caused Subdiffusion of Heavy Particles in the Imbalanced Hubbard Model
Authors: Mirko Daumann, Thomas Dahm
Abstract: The imbalanced Hubbard model features a transition between dynamic regimes depending on the mass ratio and coupling strength between two different particle species. A slowdown of the lighter particle transport can be attributed to an emergent effective disorder induced by the heavy particles for high mass ratio and strong coupling. This subdiffusive regime has been interpreted as a Griffiths phase, linking the effect to the coexistence of metallic and insulating regions. Here, we investigate the dynamics of the heavy particles, which also reveals subdiffusive behavior, yet cannot be explained within the Griffiths picture. We demonstrate that heavy particles predominantly form small clusters, mainly pairs, during the dynamical process, which reduces their propagation speed and transiently shifts the time-dependent diffusion constant into the subdiffusive regime at late times. The necessary attraction between particles driving this process can be understood within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We introduce a classical one-dimensional random walk model that can quantitatively reproduce the subdiffusion dynamics in the strong coupling regime.

Title: Mechanism of Shape Symmetry Breaking in Surfactant Mediated Crystal Growth
Authors: Sam Oaks-Leaf, David T. Limmer
Abstract: We present a dynamical model of crystal growth, in which it is possible to reliably achieve asymmetric products, beginning from symmetric initial conditions and growing within an isotropic environment. The asymmetric growth is the result of a positive feedback mechanism that amplifies the effect of thermal fluctuations in the coverage of surfactants on the growing crystalline facets. Within our simple model, we are able to understand the kinetic and thermodynamic factors involved in both the onset of symmetry breaking and the persistence of anisotropic growth. We demonstrate that the mechanism is general by studying models with increasing complexity. We argue that this mechanism of symmetry breaking underpins observations of colloidal, seed-mediated syntheses of single crystalline metal nanorods capped with strongly interacting surfactants. The parameters within our model are related to experimental observables such as the concentration, hydrophobicity, and binding strength of the surfactants, which suggests a potential route to optimize the yield of asymmetric products in colloidal nanoparticle syntheses.

Title: Accurate, transferable, and verifiable machine-learned interatomic potentials for layered materials
Authors: Johnathan D. Georgaras, Akash Ramdas, Chung Hsuan Shan, Elena Halsted, Berwyn, Tianshu Li, Felipe H. da Jornada
Abstract: Twisted layered van-der-Waals materials often exhibit unique electronic and optical properties absent in their non-twisted counterparts. Unfortunately, predicting such properties is hindered by the difficulty in determining the atomic structure in materials displaying large moiré domains. Here, we introduce a split machine-learned interatomic potential and dataset curation approach that separates intralayer and interlayer interactions and significantly improves model accuracy -- with a tenfold increase in energy and force prediction accuracy relative to conventional models. We further demonstrate that traditional MLIP validation metrics -- force and energy errors -- are inadequate for moiré structures and develop a more holistic, physically-motivated metric based on the distribution of stacking configurations. This metric effectively compares the entirety of large-scale moiré domains between two structures instead of relying on conventional measures evaluated on smaller commensurate cells. Finally, we establish that one-dimensional instead of two-dimensional moiré structures can serve as efficient surrogate systems for validating MLIPs, allowing for a practical model validation protocol against explicit DFT calculations. Applying our framework to HfS2/GaS bilayers reveals that accurate structural predictions directly translate into reliable electronic properties. Our model-agnostic approach integrates seamlessly with various intralayer and interlayer interaction models, enabling computationally tractable relaxation of moiré materials, from bilayer to complex multilayers, with rigorously validated accuracy.

Title: Finite-momentum pairing and superlattice superconductivity in valley-imbalanced rhombohedral graphene
Authors: Maine Christos, Pietro M. Bonetti, Mathias S. Scheurer
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental discovery of superconductivity emerging from a time-reversal symmetry-breaking normal state in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene, we here investigate superconducting instabilities in this system. We classify the possible pairing instabilities, including states with commensurate and incommensurate center of mass momenta. As rotational symmetry is broken in the latter type of pairing states, their momentum-space structure is most naturally characterized by a "valley-independent Chern number", measuring the relative chirality between the normal and superconducting state. We further demonstrate that superconductivity can condense at multiple incommensurate momenta simultaneously, leading to the spontaneous formation of a translational-symmetry-breaking superlattice superconductor. Studying multiple different pairing mechanisms and varying the degree of spin and valley polarization in the normal state, we compare the energetics of these superconductors. Our results demonstrate that valley-imbalanced rhombohedral tetralayer graphene can give rise to rich superconducting phenomenologies.

Title: Active wetting transitions induced by rotational noise at solid interfaces
Authors: Suchismita Das, Raghunath Chelakkot
Abstract: We investigate the wetting transitions displayed by the collection of active Brownian particles (ABPs) confined within rigid, impenetrable, flat walls. In our computational study using Brownian dynamics simulations, the wall-particle interactions are implemented with a short-range repulsive potential. An enhanced rotational diffusion at the walls is used as a control parameter for wetting transitions. Increasing the wall rotational diffusion destabilizes complete wetting, and the aggregate shows morphological transitions. We observe a sequence of morphological transitions with an increase in wall rotational diffusion: symmetric complete wetting (SCW), asymmetric complete wetting (ACW), partial wetting (PW) with droplet formation, and drying. In the PW state, we compute the contact angle as a function of activity and rotational noise. Our analysis indicates that these transitions are linked to enhanced kinetic energy fluctuations of particles and bubble formations in the dense state. We further characterize the nature of these transitions by systematically analyzing an order parameter. Our work shows that modifying local reorientation rates alone is sufficient to induce wetting transitions in active systems.

Title: Unified Micromechanics Theory of Composites
Authors: Valeriy A. Buryachenko
Abstract: We consider the matrix composite materials (CM) of either random (statistically homogeneous or inhomogeneous), periodic, or deterministic (neither random nor periodic) structures. CMs exhibit linear or nonlinear behavior, coupled or uncoupled multi-physical phenomena, locally elastic, weakly nonlocal (strain gradient and stress gradient), or strongly nonlocal (strain-type and displacement-type, peridynamics) phase properties. A modified Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) approach introduces an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE) for CMs of any structure and phase properties mentioned above. The unified iteration solution of static AGIEs is adapted to the body force with compact support serving as a fundamentally new universal training parameter. The approach also establishes a critical threshold for filtering out unsuitable sub-datasets of effective parameters through a novel Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill's classical framework. This RVE concept eliminates sample size, boundary layer, and edge effects, making it applicable to CMs of any structure and phase properties, regardless of local or nonlocal, linear or nonlinear. Incorporating this new RVE concept into machine learning and neural network techniques enables the construction of any unpredefined surrogate nonlocal operators. The methodology is structured as a modular, block-based framework, allowing independent development and refinement of software components. This flexible, robust AGIE-CAM framework integrates data-driven, multi-scale, and multi-physics modeling, accelerating research in CM of any microtopology and phase properties considered. The AGIE-CAM framework represents a groundbreaking paradigm shift in the micromechanics of composites, redefining the very philosophy that underpins our understanding of their behavior at the microscopic level.

Title: Sampling Decisions
Authors: Michael Chertkov, Sungsoo Ahn, Hamidreza Behjoo
Abstract: In this manuscript we introduce a novel Decision Flow (DF) framework for sampling from a target distribution while incorporating additional guidance from a prior sampler. DF can be viewed as an AI driven algorithmic reincarnation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach in Stochastic Optimal Control. It extends the continuous space, continuous time path Integral Diffusion sampling technique to discrete time and space, while also generalizing the Generative Flow Network framework. In its most basic form, an explicit, Neural Network (NN) free formulation, DF leverages the linear solvability of the the underlying MDP to adjust the transition probabilities of the prior sampler. The resulting Markov Process is expressed as a convolution of the reverse time Green's function of the prior sampling with the target distribution. We illustrate the DF framework through an example of sampling from the Ising model, discuss potential NN based extensions, and outline how DF can enhance guided sampling across various applications.

Title: Spin squeezing in an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond

Abstract: Spin squeezed states provide a seminal example of how the structure of quantum mechanical correlations can be controlled to produce metrologically useful entanglement. Such squeezed states have been demonstrated in a wide variety of artificial quantum systems ranging from atoms in optical cavities to trapped ion crystals. By contrast, despite their numerous advantages as practical sensors, spin ensembles in solid-state materials have yet to be controlled with sufficient precision to generate targeted entanglement such as spin squeezing. In this work, we present the first experimental demonstration of spin squeezing in a solid-state spin system. Our experiments are performed on a strongly-interacting ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond at room temperature, and squeezing (-0.5 $\pm$ 0.1 dB) is generated by the native magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between NVs. In order to generate and detect squeezing in a solid-state spin system, we overcome a number of key challenges of broad experimental and theoretical interest. First, we develop a novel approach, using interaction-enabled noise spectroscopy, to characterize the quantum projection noise in our system without directly resolving the spin probability distribution. Second, noting that the random positioning of spin defects severely limits the generation of spin squeezing, we implement a pair of strategies aimed at isolating the dynamics of a relatively ordered sub-ensemble of NV centers. Our results open the door to entanglement-enhanced metrology using macroscopic ensembles of optically active spins in solids.

Title: Interacting non-Hermitian edge and cluster bursts on a digital quantum processor
Authors: Jin Ming Koh, Wen-Tan Xue, Tommy Tai, Dax Enshan Koh, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: A lossy quantum system harboring the non-Hermitian skin effect can in certain conditions exhibit anomalously high loss at the boundaries of the system compared to the bulk, a phenomenon termed the non-Hermitian edge burst. We uncover interacting many-body extensions of the edge burst that are spatially extended and patterned, as well as cluster bursts that occur away from boundaries. Owing to the methodological difficulty and overhead of accurately realizing non-Hermitian dynamical evolution, much less tunable interactions, few experimental avenues in studying the single-particle edge burst have been reported to date and none for many-body variants. We overcome these roadblocks in this study, and present a realization of edge and cluster bursts in an interacting quantum ladder model on a superconducting quantum processor. We utilize a time-stepping algorithm, which implements time-evolution by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians by composing a linear combination of unitaries scheme and product formulae, to assess long-time behavior of the system. We observe signatures of the non-Hermitian edge burst on up to 64 unit cells, and detect the closing of the dissipative gap, a necessary condition for the edge burst, by probing the imaginary spectrum of the system. In suitable interacting regimes, we identify the emergence of spatial patterning and cluster bursts. Beyond establishing these generalized forms of edge burst phenomena, our study paves the way for digital quantum processors to be harnessed as a versatile platform for non-Hermitian condensed-matter physics.

Title: Signal amplification in a solid-state quantum sensor via asymmetric time-reversal of many-body dynamics
Authors: Haoyang Gao, Leigh S. Martin, Lillian B. Hughes, Nathaniel T. Leitao, Piotr Put, Hengyun Zhou, Nazli U. Koyluoglu, Simon A. Meynell, Ania C. Bleszynski Jayich, Hongkun Park, Mikhail D. Lukin
Abstract: Electronic spins of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond constitute a promising system for micro- and nano-scale magnetic sensing, due to their operation under ambient conditions, ease of placement in close proximity to sensing targets, and biological compatibility. At high densities, the electronic spins interact through dipolar coupling, which typically limits but can also potentially enhance sensing performance. Here we report the experimental demonstration of many-body signal amplification in a solid-state, room temperature quantum sensor. Our approach utilizes time-reversed two-axis-twisting interactions, engineered through dynamical control of the quantization axis and Floquet engineering in a two-dimensional ensemble of NV centers. Strikingly, we observe that the optimal amplification occurs when the backward evolution time equals twice the forward evolution time, in sharp contrast to the conventional Loschmidt echo. These observations can be understood as resulting from an underlying time-reversed mirror symmetry of the microscopic dynamics, providing key insights into signal amplification and opening the door towards entanglement-enhanced practical quantum sensing.

Title: Dynamics in the presence of local symmetry-breaking impurities
Authors: Yahui Li, Pablo Sala, Frank Pollmann, Sanjay Moudgalya, Olexei Motrunich
Abstract: Continuous symmetries lead to universal slow relaxation of correlation functions in quantum many-body systems. In this work, we study how local symmetry-breaking impurities affect the dynamics of these correlation functions using Brownian quantum circuits, which we expect to apply to generic non-integrable systems with the same symmetries. While explicitly breaking the symmetry is generally expected to lead to eventual restoration of full ergodicity, we find that approximately conserved quantities that survive under such circumstances can still induce slow relaxation. This can be understood using a super-Hamiltonian formulation, where low-lying excitations determine the late-time dynamics and exact ground states correspond to conserved quantities. We show that in one dimension, symmetry-breaking impurities modify diffusive and subdiffusive behaviors associated with U$(1)$ and dipole conservation at late-times, e.g., by increasing power-law decay exponents of the decay of autocorrelation functions. This stems from the fact that for these symmetries, impurities are relevant in the renormalization group sense, e.g., bulk impurities effectively disconnect the system, completely modifying both temporal and spatial correlations. On the other hand, for an impurity that disrupts strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the super-Hamiltonian only acquires an exponentially small gap, leading to prethermal plateaus in autocorrelation functions which extend for times that scale exponentially with the distance to the impurity. Overall, our approach systematically characterizes how symmetry breaking impurities affect relaxation dynamics in symmetric systems.

Title: Optimal control over the full counting statistics in a non-adiabatic pump
Authors: François Impens (IF/UFRJ), Felippo M. D'Angelis (IF/UFRJ), David Guéry-Odelin (LCAR/UPS), Felipe A. Pinheiro (IF/UFRJ), Caio Lewenkopf (IF/UFRJ)
Abstract: We introduce a systematic procedure based on optimal control theory to address the full counting statistics of particle transport in a stochastic system. Our approach enhances the performance of a Thouless pump in the non-adiabatic regime by simultaneously optimizing the average pumping rate while minimizing noise. We demonstrate our optimization procedure on a paradigmatic model for the electronic transport through a quantum dot, both in the limit of vanishing Coulomb interaction and in the interacting regime. Our method enables independent control of the moments associated with charge and spin transfer, allowing for the enhancement of spin current with minimal charge current or the independent tuning of spin and charge fluctuations. These results underscore the versatility of our approach, which can be applied to a broad class of stochastic systems.

Title: Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures
Authors: D. Bafia, B. Abdisatarov, R. Pilipenko, Y. Lu, G. Eremeev, A. Romanenko, A. Grassellino
Abstract: Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium can introduce microwave losses in superconducting devices, affecting both niobium-based qubits and resonators. While our group has extensively studied this problem at temperatures above 1~K, in this study we quantify for the first time the losses driven by magnetic vortices for niobium-based quantum devices operating down to millikelvin temperature, and in the low photon counts regime. By cooling a single interface system a 3-D niobium superconducting cavity in a dilution refrigerator through the superconducting transition temperature in controlled levels of magnetic fields, we isolate the flux-induced losses and quantify the added surface resistance per unit of trapped magnetic flux. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux introduces approximately 2~n$\Omega /$mG at 10~mK and at 6~GHz in high RRR niobium. We find that the decay rate of a 6~GHz niobium cavity at 10~mK which contains a native niobium pentoxide will be dominated by the TLS oxide losses until vortices begin to impact $T_1$ for trapped magnetic field ($B_{\text{trap}}$) levels of $>$100~mG. In the absence of the niobium pentoxide, $B_{\text{trap}}=$~10~mG limits $Q_0\sim$~10\textsuperscript{10}, or $T_1\sim$~350~ms, highlighting the importance of magnetic shielding and magnetic hygiene in enabling $T_1>$~1~s. We observe that the flux-induced resistance decreases with temperature-yet remains largely field-independent, qualitatively explained by thermal activation of vortices in the flux-flow regime. We present a phenomenological model which captures the salient experimental observations. Scaling our findings to typical transmon qubit dimensions suggests that these 2-D structures could be robust against vortex dissipation up to several hundreds~mG. We are directly addressing vortex losses in transmon qubits made with low RRR Nb films in a separate experimental study.

Title: Costs and benefits of phytoplankton motility
Authors: Peyman Fahimi, Andrew J. Irwin, Michael Lynch
Abstract: The motility skills of phytoplankton have evolved and persisted over millions of years, primarily in response to factors such as nutrient and light availability, temperature and viscosity gradients, turbulence, and predation pressure. Phytoplankton motility is broadly categorized into swimming and buoyancy regulation. Despite studies in the literature exploring the motility costs and benefits of phytoplankton, there remains a gap in our integrative understanding of direct and indirect energy expenditures, starting from when an organism initiates movement due to any biophysical motive, to when the organism encounters intracellular and environmental challenges. Here we gather all available pieces of this puzzle from literature in biology, physics, and oceanography to paint an overarching picture of our current knowledge. The characterization of sinking and rising behavior as passive motility has resulted in the concept of sinking and rising internal efficiency being overlooked. We define this efficiency based on any energy dissipation associated with processes of mass density adjustment, as exemplified in structures like frustules and vacuoles. We propose that sinking and rising are active motility processes involving non-visible mechanisms, as species demonstrate active and rapid strategies in response to turbulence, predation risk, and gradients of nutrients, light, temperature, and viscosity. Identifying intracellular buoyancy-regulating dissipative processes offers deeper insight into the motility costs relative to the organism's total metabolic rate.

Title: State preparation with parallel-sequential circuits
Authors: Zhi-Yuan Wei, Daniel Malz
Abstract: We introduce parallel-sequential (PS) circuits, a family of quantum circuit layouts that interpolate between brickwall and sequential circuits, which introduces control parameters governing the ratio of over the amount of entanglement and the maximum correlation distance they can express. We provide numerical evidence that PS circuits can efficiently prepare many-body ground states in one dimension. On noisy devices, characterized through both idling errors and two-qubit gate errors, we show that in a wide parameter regime, PS circuits outperform brickwall, sequential, and log-depth circuits from [Malz, Styliaris, Wei, Cirac, PRL 132, 040404 (2024)]. Additionally, we demonstrate that properly chosen noisy random PS circuits suppress error proliferation and, when employed as a variational ansatz, exhibit superior trainability.

Title: AI-driven Uncertainty Quantification & Multi-Physics Approach to Evaluate Cladding Materials in a Microreactor
Authors: Alex Foutch, Kazuma Kobayashi, Ayodeji Alajo, Dinesh Kumar, Syed Bahauddin Alam
Abstract: The pursuit of enhanced nuclear safety has spurred the development of accident-tolerant cladding (ATC) materials for light water reactors (LWRs). This study investigates the potential of repurposing these ATCs in advanced reactor designs, aiming to expedite material development and reduce costs. The research employs a multi-physics approach, encompassing neutronics, heat transfer, thermodynamics, and structural mechanics, to evaluate four candidate materials (Haynes 230, Zircaloy-4, FeCrAl, and SiC-SiC) within the context of a high-temperature, sodium-cooled microreactor, exemplified by the Kilopower design. While neutronic simulations revealed negligible power profile variations among the materials, finite element analyses highlighted the superior thermal stability of SiC-SiC and the favorable stress resistance of Haynes 230. The high-temperature environment significantly impacted material performance, particularly for Zircaloy-4 and FeCrAl, while SiC-SiC's inherent properties limited its ability to withstand stress loads. Additionally, AI-driven uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess the influence of material property variations on maximum hoop stress. The findings underscore the need for further research into high-temperature material properties to facilitate broader applicability of existing materials to advanced reactors. Haynes 230 is identified as the most promising candidate based on the evaluated criteria.

Title: Cyclic Voltammetry of Ion-Coupled Electron Transfer Reactions for Diagnosing Energy Storage Materials
Authors: Keyvan Malaie
Abstract: The methods of Nicholson and Shain and Randles-Sevcik are the paradigms of voltammetry of redox species. However, as they were originally developed for aqueous redox couples, they cannot be directly applied to solid redox films such as those of battery materials. Herein, for the first time, we present a cyclic voltammetry model based on semi-infinite linear diffusion for ion-coupled electron transfer reactions. The simulated CVs contain parameters such as capacity, ion activity, formal potential of proton-coupled electron transfer, and scan rate that are physically more meaningful than those of the current models in characterizing energy storage materials. We apply this model to the MnO2 cathode material as a proof of concept and discuss the significance of the simulation parameters for determining the energetics of the underlying phase transitions and the charge storage mechanisms. According to the present model, two linear regression lines can be established from relatively simple voltammetry experiments for characterizing energy storage materials: 1) The regression line of the CV mid-peak potential vs. Log of ion activity (or pH), in which the slope and the intercept provide information on the type of charge-carrier ions and their solvation state, respectively. 2) The regression line of the capacity vs. the inverse of the square root of scan rate, where the slope and intercept indicate the contributions of bulk and surface charges in thin redox films, respectively.

Title: The nonlinear limit of Babinet's Principle
Authors: Valentin Dichtl, Thorsten Schuhmacher, Markus Lippitz
Abstract: Babinet's principle is a powerful tool for predicting the scattering behavior of planar structures where the solution for the complementary structure is already known. This makes it ubiquitous in the design of aperture antennas or metamaterials. Even for plasmonic nanostructures, a qualitative match of the behavior for complementary structures has been reported. Here, we discuss whether Babinet's principle can be extended to nonlinear scattering. We compare the third harmonic emission of plasmonic nanorods and complementary nanoslits by far field imaging and simulation. We find significantly different far field images, in agreement between experiment and simulation. We explain these differences by the higher spatial resolution at the third harmonic wavelength and by additional eddy currents in slits that are not present in rods. Within these limits, Babinet's principle can guide the design of inverted nonlinear plasmonic resonators, which promise to be more stable at high excitation power due to better thermal conductivity.

Title: Duality symmetry, zero energy modes and boundary spectrum of the sine-Gordon/massive Thirring model
Authors: Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, Ari Mizel, Patrick Azaria
Abstract: We solve the one-dimensional massive Thirring model, which is equivalent to the one-dimensional sine-Gordon model, with two types of Dirchlet boundary conditions: open boundary conditions (OBC) and twisted open boundary conditions ($\widehat{\text{OBC}}$). The system exhibits a duality symmetry which relates models with opposite bare mass parameters and boundary conditions, i.e: $m_0 \leftrightarrow - m_0$, $\text{OBC}\leftrightarrow\widehat{\text{OBC}}$. For $m_0<0$ and OBC, the system is in a trivial phase whose ground state is unique, as in the case of periodic boundary conditions. In contrast, for $m_0<0$ and $\widehat{\text{OBC}}$, the system is in a topological phase characterized by the existence of zero energy modes (ZEMs) localized at each boundary. As dictated by the duality symmetry, for $m_0>0$ and $\widehat{\text{OBC}}$, the trivial phase occurs, whereas the topological phase occurs for $m_0>0$ and OBC. In addition, we analyze the structure of the boundary excitations, finding significant differences between the attractive $(g>0)$ and the repulsive $(g<0)$ regimes.

Title: 2D transmons with lifetimes and coherence times exceeding 1 millisecond

Smitham, Atharv Joshi, Elizabeth Hedrick, Alex Pakpour-Tabrizi, Shashwat Kumar, Apoorv Jindal, Ray D. Chang, Ambrose Yang, Guangming Cheng, Nan Yao, Robert J. Cava, Nathalie P. de Leon, Andrew A. Houck
Abstract: Materials improvements are a powerful approach to reducing loss and decoherence in superconducting qubits because such improvements can be readily translated to large scale processors. Recent work improved transmon coherence by utilizing tantalum (Ta) as a base layer and sapphire as a substrate. The losses in these devices are dominated by two-level systems (TLSs) with comparable contributions from both the surface and bulk dielectrics, indicating that both must be tackled to achieve major improvements in the state of the art. Here we show that replacing the substrate with high-resistivity silicon (Si) dramatically decreases the bulk substrate loss, enabling 2D transmons with time-averaged quality factors (Q) exceeding 1.5 x 10^7, reaching a maximum Q of 2.5 x 10^7, corresponding to a lifetime (T_1) of up to 1.68 ms. This low loss allows us to observe decoherence effects related to the Josephson junction, and we use improved, low-contamination junction deposition to achieve Hahn echo coherence times (T_2E) exceeding T_1. We achieve these material improvements without any modifications to the qubit architecture, allowing us to readily incorporate standard quantum control gates. We demonstrate single qubit gates with 99.994% fidelity. The Ta-on-Si platform comprises a simple material stack that can potentially be fabricated at wafer scale, and therefore can be readily translated to large-scale quantum processors.

Title: Benchmarking direct and indirect dipolar spin-exchange interactions between two Rydberg atoms
Authors: Gabriel Emperauger, Mu Qiao, Guillaume Bornet, Cheng Chen, Romain Martin, Yuki Torii Chew, Bastien Gély, Lukas Klein, Daniel Barredo, Antoine Browaeys, Thierry Lahaye
Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of various types of spin-exchange interactions between two individual atoms, where pseudo-spin degrees of freedom are encoded in different Rydberg states. For the case of the direct dipole-dipole interaction between states of opposite parity, such as between $nS$ and $nP$, we investigate the effects of positional disorder arising from the residual atomic motion, on the coherence of spin-exchange oscillations. We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced Förster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.

Title: Classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains
Authors: Alex Bols, Wojciech De Roeck, Michiel De Wilde, Bruno de O. Carvalho
Abstract: We consider the action of a finite group $G$ by locality preserving automorphisms (quantum cellular automata) on quantum spin chains. We refer to such group actions as ``symmetries''. The natural notion of equivalence for such symmetries is \emph{stable equivalence}, which allows for stacking with factorized group actions. Stacking also endows the set of equivalence classes with a group structure. We prove that the anomaly of such symmetries provides an isomorphism between the group of stable equivalence classes of symmetries with the cohomology group $H^3(G,U(1))$, consistent with previous conjectures. This amounts to a complete classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains. We further show that a locality preserving symmetry is stably equivalent to one that can be presented by finite depth quantum circuits with covariant gates if and only if the slant product of its anomaly is trivial in $H^2(G, U(1)[G])$.

Title: Charging dynamics of electric double layer capacitors including beyond-mean-field electrostatic correlations
Authors: David Fertig, Mathijs Janssen
Abstract: Electric double layer (EDL) formation underlies the functioning of supercapacitors and several other electrochemical technologies. Here, we study how the EDL formation near two flat blocking electrodes separated by $2L$ is affected by beyond-mean-field Coulombic interactions, which can be substantial for electrolytes of high salt concentration or with multivalent ions. Our model combines the Nernst-Planck and Bazant-Storey-Kornyshev (BSK) equations; the latter is a modified Poisson equation with a correlation length $\ell_c$. In response to a voltage step, the system charges exponentially with a characteristic timescale $\tau$ that depends nonmonotonically on $\ell_c$. For small $\ell_c$, $\tau$ is given by the BSK capacitance times a dilute electrolyte's resistance, in line with [Zhao, Phys. Rev. E 84, 051504 (2011)]; here, $\tau$ decreases with increasing $\ell_c$. Increasing the correlation length beyond $\ell_c\approx L^{2/3}\lambda_D^{1/3}$, with $\lambda_D$ the Debye length, $\tau$ reaches a minimum, rises as $\tau\propto \lambda_D\ell_c/D$, and plateaus at $\tau=4L^2/(\pi^2 D)$. Our results imply that strongly correlated, strongly confined electrolytes - ionic liquids in the surface force balance apparatus, say - move slower than predicted so far.

Title: Cooling strongly self-organized particles using adiabatic demagnetization
Authors: Simon B. Jäger
Abstract: We study the dynamics of polarizable particles coupled to a lossy cavity mode that are transversally driven by a laser. Our analysis is performed in the regime where the cavity linewidth exceeds the recoil frequency by several orders of magnitude. Using a two-stage cooling protocol we show that the particles' kinetic energy can be reduced down to the recoil energy. This cooling protocol relies in its first stage on a high laser power such that the particles cool into a strongly self-organized pattern. This can be seen as a strongly magnetized state. In a second stage we adiabatically ramp down the laser intensity such that the particles' kinetic energy is transferred to their potential energy and the particles are ``demagnetized''. In this second stage we optimize the ramping speed which needs to be fast enough to avoid unwanted heating and slow enough such that the dynamics remains to good approximation adiabatic.

Title: Separation of variables for higher rank integrable models: review of recent progress
Authors: Fedor Levkovich-Maslyuk
Abstract: Separation of variables (SoV) is a powerful method expected to be applicable for a wide range of quantum integrable systems, from models in condensed matter physics to gauge and string theories. Yet its full implementation for many higher rank examples, such as SU(N) spin chains with N>2, has remained elusive for a long time. In this pedagogical review we discuss the major progress achieved recently in understanding SoV for models of this type. In particular, for rational SU(N) spin chains we describe different constructions of the SoV basis, novel compact forms for spin chain eigenstates, the functional SoV approach, and explicit computation of the SoV measure. We also discuss key first applications of these results, namely the new compact determinant representations for many observables such as scalar products and correlators.

Title: Direct comparison of stochastic driven nonlinear dynamical systems for combinatorial optimizations
Authors: Junpeng Hou, Amin Barzegar, Helmut G. Katzgraber
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in industrial applications. However, finding optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can often be extremely hard. Because some of these problems can be mapped to the ground-state search of the Ising model, tremendous effort has been devoted to developing solvers for Ising-type problems over the past decades. Recent advances in controlling and manipulating both quantum and classical systems have enabled novel computing paradigms such as quantum simulators and coherent Ising machines to tackle hard optimization problems. Here, we examine and benchmark several physics-inspired optimization algorithms, including coherent Ising machines, gain-dissipative algorithms, simulated bifurcation machines, and Hopfield neural networks, which we collectively refer to as stochastic-driven nonlinear dynamical systems. Most importantly, we benchmark these algorithms against random Ising problems with planted solutions and compare them to simulated annealing as a baseline leveraging the same software stack for all solvers. We further study how different numerical integration techniques and graph connectivity affect performance. This work provides an overview of a diverse set of new optimization paradigms.

Title: Two-qubit logic and teleportation with mobile spin qubits in silicon
Authors: Yuta Matsumoto, Maxim De Smet, Larysa Tryputen, Sander L. de Snoo, Sergey V. Amitonov, Amir Sammak, Maximilian Rimbach-Russ, Giordano Scappucci, Lieven M. K. Vandersypen
Abstract: The scalability and power of quantum computing architectures depend critically on high-fidelity operations and robust and flexible qubit connectivity. In this respect, mobile qubits are particularly attractive as they enable dynamic and reconfigurable qubit arrays. This approach allows quantum processors to adapt their connectivity patterns during operation, implement different quantum error correction codes on the same hardware, and optimize resource utilization through dedicated functional zones for specific operations like measurement or entanglement generation. Such flexibility also relieves architectural constraints, as recently demonstrated in atomic systems based on trapped ions and neutral atoms manipulated with optical tweezers. In solid-state platforms, highly coherent shuttling of electron spins was recently reported. A key outstanding question is whether it may be possible to perform quantum gates directly on the mobile spins. In this work, we demonstrate two-qubit operations between two electron spins carried towards each other in separate traveling potential minima in a semiconductor device. We find that the interaction strength is highly tunable by their spatial separation, achieving an average two-qubit gate fidelity of about 99\%. Additionally, we implement conditional post-selected quantum state teleportation between spatially separated qubits with an average gate fidelity of 87\%, showcasing the potential of mobile spin qubits for non-local quantum information processing. We expect that operations on mobile qubits will become a universal feature of future large-scale semiconductor quantum processors.

Title: Self-aligned pillar arrays embedding site-controlled single quantum dots for enhanced non-classical light emission
Authors: Gediminas Juska, Simone Varo, Nicola Maraviglia, John O'Hara, Salvador Medina, Luca Colavecchi, Francesco Mattana, Armando Trapala, Michael Schmidt, Agnieszka Gocalinska, Emanuele Pelucchi
Abstract: This work presents a foundational approach for fabricating arrays of self-aligned micro- and nanopillar structures incorporating individual site-controlled quantum dots (QDs) for enhanced light extraction. This method leverages the non-planar surface morphology of pyramidal QD samples to define dielectric masks self - aligned to the QD positions. The mask size, and consequently the lateral dimensions of the pillars, is precisely controlled through a chemical mechanical polishing step, obviating the need for any additional lithography step for creating the pillar. This fabrication technique offers several key advantages, including precise control over the pillar sites, and fully deterministic embedding of QD structures. The functionality of the structures was validated by integrating single In0.25Ga0.75As QDs - upon two-photon excitation of the biexciton state, the emission of single and polarization-entangled photon pairs was observed. Additionally, an extra fabrication step to deposit dome-like structures atop the pillars was demonstrated, effectively enhancing light extraction efficiency up to 12%.

Title: pyTTN: An Open Source Toolbox for Open and Closed System Quantum Dynamics Simulations Using Tree Tensor Networks
Authors: Lachlan P Lindoy, Daniel Rodrigo-Albert, Yannic Rath, Ivan Rungger
Abstract: We present the Python Tree Tensor Network package (pyTTN) for the evaluation of dynamical properties of closed and open quantum systems that makes use of Tree Tensor Network (TTN), or equivalently the multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), based representations of wavefunctions. This package includes several features allowing for easy setup of zero- and finite-temperature calculations for general Hamiltonians using single and multi-set TTN ansätze with an adaptive bond dimension through the use of subspace expansion techniques. All core features are implemented in C++ with Python bindings provided to simplify the use of this package. In addition to these core features, pyTTN provides several tools for setting up efficient simulation of open quantum system dynamics, including the use of the TTN ansatz to represent the auxiliary density operator space for the simulation of the Hierarchical Equation of Motion (HEOM) method and generalised pseudomode methods; furthermore we demonstrate that the two approaches are equivalent up to a non-unitary normal mode transformation acting on the pseudomode degrees of freedom. We present a set of applications of the package, starting with the widely used benchmark case of the photo-excitation dynamics of 24 mode pyrazine, following which we consider a more challenging model describing the exciton dynamics at the interface of a $n$-oligothiophene donor-C$_{60}$ fullerene acceptor system. Finally, we consider applications to open quantum systems, including the spin-boson model, a set of extended dissipative spin models, and an Anderson impurity model. By combining ease of use, an efficient implementation, as well as an extendable design allowing for the addition of future extensions, pyTTN can be integrated in a wide range of computational modelling software.

Title: Natural Quantization of Neural Networks
Authors: Richard Barney, Djamil Lakhdar-Hamina, Victor Galitski
Abstract: We propose a natural quantization of a standard neural network, where the neurons correspond to qubits and the activation functions are implemented via quantum gates and measurements. The simplest quantized neural network corresponds to applying single-qubit rotations, with the rotation angles being dependent on the weights and measurement outcomes of the previous layer. This realization has the advantage of being smoothly tunable from the purely classical limit with no quantum uncertainty (thereby reproducing the classical neural network exactly) to a quantum case, where superpositions introduce an intrinsic uncertainty in the network. We benchmark this architecture on a subset of the standard MNIST dataset and find a regime of "quantum advantage," where the validation error rate in the quantum realization is smaller than that in the classical model. We also consider another approach where quantumness is introduced via weak measurements of ancilla qubits entangled with the neuron qubits. This quantum neural network also allows for smooth tuning of the degree of quantumness by controlling an entanglement angle, $g$, with $g=\frac\pi 2$ replicating the classical regime. We find that validation error is also minimized within the quantum regime in this approach. We also observe a quantum transition, with sharp loss of the quantum network's ability to learn at a critical point $g_c$. The proposed quantum neural networks are readily realizable in present-day quantum computers on commercial datasets.

Title: Emergent coding phases and hardware-tailored quantum codes
Authors: Gaurav Gyawali, Henry Shackleton, Zhu-Xi Luo, Michael Lawler
Abstract: Finding good quantum codes for a particular hardware application and determining their error thresholds is central to quantum error correction. The threshold defines the noise level where a quantum code switches between a coding and a no-coding \emph{phase}. Provided sufficiently frequent error correction, the quantum capacity theorem guarantees the existence of an optimal code that provides a maximum communication rate. By viewing a system experiencing repeated error correction as a novel form of matter, this optimal code, in analogy to Jaynes's maximum entropy principle of quantum statistical mechanics, \emph{defines a phase}. We explore coding phases from this perspective using the Open Random Unitary Model (ORUM), which is a quantum circuit with depolarizing and dephasing channels. Using numerical optimization, we find this model hosts three phases: a maximally mixed phase, a ``$Z_2$ code'' that breaks its U(1) gauge symmetry down to $Z_2$, and a no-coding phase with first-order transitions between them and a novel \emph{zero capacity multi-critical point} where all three phases meet. For the $Z_2$ code, we provide two practical error correction procedures that fall short of the optimal codes and qualitatively alter the phase diagram, splitting the multi-critical point into two second-order coding no-coding phase transitions. Carrying out our approach on current noisy devices could provide a systematic way to construct quantum codes for robust computation and communication.

Title: Intermediate statistics: addressing the Landau diamagnetism problem
Authors: Andre A. Marinho, Francisco A. Brito, G.M. Viswanathan, C. G. Bezerra
Abstract: Quantum groups and quantum algebras have received considerable attention in the last decades because they are very useful as mathematical tools of research. Existing proposals for quantum groups have always suggested the idea of deforming a classical object. Motivated by the possibility of anyons in three dimensions ($d=3$), with important consequences to a wide range of fields of physics, in the present work we investigate how the magnetization and other thermodynamic quantities, associated to the Landau diamagnetism problem, depend on the deforming parameter of two models with intermediate statistics: (i) $q$-fermions and (ii) $F$-anyons, and make {\it comparisons between both cases}. In particular, we extend the results from the literature for $q$-fermions by considering {\it second order terms} in the expansion of the grand partition function. Also, we find that for $F$-anyons statistics the magnetization shows a stronger response with respect to magnetic fields compared to magnetization for $q$-fermions statistics. This theoretical outcome may be experimentally verified for instance in superconductors, that are perfect diamagnetic materials with strong magnetic susceptibility, by adjusting impurities or pressure. The latter can be associated to the deforming parameter $q$.

Title: Symmetry- and Energy-Resolved Entanglement Dynamics in Disordered Bose-Hubbard Model
Authors: Jie Chen, Chun Chen, Xiaoqun Wang
Abstract: Using numerical quantum quenches with the integration of both symmetry and energy resolutions, we comprehensively study the dynamics of symmetry-resolved entanglement in a disordered Bose-Hubbard (dBH) model, concentrating on the two types of inhomogeneous initial states to target the lower- and higher-energy sections of its dynamical phase diagram. (i) Motivated by the recent experiment [A. Lukin et al., Science 364, 256 (2019)] which focused on the lower-energy dynamic behaviors of the dBH chain, we first show that, at low energies, for a thermalizing state, although the second law of thermodynamics prohibits the decrease of the total entropy over time, for part of the channel-resolved entropies, a long-term entropic reduction may arise at weak disorder. (ii) A companion channel-resolved analysis at strong disorder further hints that the priorly observed double-log growth of the number entropy might not directly indicate the breakdown of MBL in spin or fermion chains, providing a refreshing perspective on this major controversy in the community. (iii) From time-evolving the line-shape low-energy product state, we subsequently reveal an abrupt formation of a novel "entropy imbalance pattern" across the different symmetry channels. Intriguingly, this imbalance melts in the strong-disorder limit. We conjecture that the melting of the entropic pattern, together with the freezing of a concurrent particle-density wave, embodies a dual trait inherent to MBL. (iv) Specifically, we find a cluster MBL regime, unique to the Bose statistics, emerging from the higher-energy section. This cluster MBL regime realizable even at weak disorder appears not suffer from the finite-size drift and is distinguished by its absence of the hallmark of MBL - the unbounded growth of the entanglement entropy. Our theoretical predictions are by and large testable via the present experimental facilities.

Title: Nonequilibrium effects in ballistic point contacts Ta-Cu and 2H-NbSe2-Cu. Two-gap superconductivity in 2H-NbSe2
Authors: N.L. Bobrov
Abstract: Ta-Cu and NbSe2-Cu heterocontacts have been studied. For Ta-Cu contacts, a theoretical estimation of the delta-functional barrier at the boundary, arising due to the mismatch of the Fermi parameters of the contacting metals, has been carried out, and good agreement between the calculation and experiment has been obtained. An expression for estimating the diameter of the heterocontact on both sides of the boundary is obtained. The value of the jump-like reduction of the excess current (and superconducting gap) associated with the phase transition of the superconducting region near the point contact to a spatially inhomogeneous state when the critical concentration of nonequilibrium quasiparticles is reached is determined. The dependence of the additive differential resistance on the displacement at the contact arising after the phase transition due to the excess charge of quasiparticles and the associated reverse current (or additive voltage) is obtained. In 2H-NbSe2, a two-zone superconductivity character with an 8-fold difference in the energy gap values takes place. Under the action of current injection of nonequilibrium quasiparticles, there is a sequential phase transition of layers adjacent to the point contact into a spatially inhomogeneous state with a suppressed gap, which is accompanied by a stepwise change in the slope of the I-V curve with a discrete increase in the differential resistance.

Title: Exact solutions and Dynamical phase transitions in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model with Dual nonlinear interactions
Authors: Dongyang Yu
Abstract: Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model is paradigmatic to study quantum phase transition in equilibrium or non-equilibrium systems and entanglement dynamics in a variety of disciplines. The generic LMG model usually incorporates two nonlinear interactions. While the classical dynamics of the single-nonlinear-inteaction LMG model is well understood through Jacobi elliptic functions, the dualinteraction case remains unexplored due to analytical challenges. Here, by constructing an auxiliary function that maps the dynamics to the complex plane of Jacobi elliptic functions, we derive exact solutions of classical dynamics for the dual-interaction LMG model. Based on the exact solutions, we give the classical dynamical phase diagram of the LMG model with dual nonlinear interactions, and find out a non-logarithmic behavior of dynamical criticality which is absent in case of single nonlinear interaction. Our results establish a benchmark to analyze the quantum dynamical phase transitions and many-body entanglement dynamics of finite-size LMG model.

Title: Chiral adiabatic transmission protected by Fermi surface topology
Authors: Isidora Araya Day, Kostas Vilkelis, Antonio L. R. Manesco, A. Mert Bozkurt, Valla Fatemi, Anton R. Akhmerov
Abstract: We demonstrate that Andreev modes that propagate along a transparent Josephson junction have a perfect transmission at the point where three junctions meet. The chirality and the number of quantized transmission channels is determined by the topology of the Fermi surface and the vorticity of the superconducting phase differences at the trijunction. We explain this chiral adiabatic transmission (CAT) as a consequence of the adiabatic evolution of the scattering modes both in momentum and real space. The dispersion relation of the junction then separates the scattering trajectories by introducing inaccessible regions of phase space. We expect that CAT is observable in nonlocal conductance and thermal transport measurements. Furthermore, because it does not rely on particle-hole symmetry, CAT is also possible to observe directly in metamaterials.

We present results for several examples, namely the bosonic Laughlin state stabilized by contact two-body interactions and the bosonic Moore-Read state stabilized by either three- or two-body interactions. Our findings demonstrate that the Bisognano-Wichmann Hamiltonian provides a reliable approximation of the entanglement Hamiltonian as a fully-local operator that can be written without any prior knowledge of the specific state under consideration.

Title: The Uhlmann Phase Winding in Bose-Einstein Condensates at Finite Temperature
Authors: Chang-Yan Wang, Yan He
Abstract: We investigate the Uhlmann phase, a generalization of the celebrated Berry phase, for Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) at finite temperature. The Uhlmann phase characterizes topological properties of mixed states, in contrast to the Berry phase which is defined for pure states at zero temperature. Using the $SU(1,1)$ symmetry of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian, we derive a general formula for the Uhlmann phase of BECs. Numerical calculations reveal that the Uhlmann phase can differ from the Berry phase in the zero-temperature limit, contrary to previous studies. As the temperature increases, the Uhlmann phase exhibits a winding behavior, and we relate the total winding degree to the Berry phase. This winding indicates that the Uhlmann phase takes values on a Riemann surface. Furthermore, we propose an experimental scheme to measure the Uhlmann phase of BECs by purifying the density matrix using an atomic interferometer.

Title: Quantification of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in two-dimensional hole gases
Authors: Peter Stano, Daniel Loss
Abstract: We theoretically investigate heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in two-dimensional hole gases (2DHG). We restrict our analysis to the zone center, appropriate for the low-density regime, which leads to a simple description, analytical results, and physical insights. We identify two different types of hole-Hamiltonian terms concerning mixing. The first type changes the direction of the pure spinors, without admixing light-hole components. It is efficient for Rabi driving the heavy-hole spin. The second type induces mixing and changes the eigenvalues of the $g$-tensor. We analyze several measures that characterize the mixing quantitatively in Ge, Si, and GaAs, namely the $g$-factor, the light-hole weight in the wave function, the off-diagonal matrix elements in the Hamiltonian, and the strength of the induced spin-orbit interaction. We identify the canonical coordinate frame associated with a generic spin-3/2 Hamiltonian with time-reversal symmetry (TRS). In this coordinate frame, the mixing is quantified by a single parameter, the mixing angle $\vartheta$. We interpret it as the canonical (coordinate-frame and Hamiltonian-basis independent) measure of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing. All the investigated mixing measures are simple functions of $\vartheta$. As an illustration, we use our model to analyze heavy-hole spin qubit $g$-tensor, dephasing, relaxation, and Rabi frequencies, interpreting the arising effects as due to rotations of the canonical frame and changes of the mixing angle $\vartheta$.

Title: Transformer neural networks and quantum simulators: a hybrid approach for simulating strongly correlated systems
Authors: Hannah Lange, Guillaume Bornet, Gabriel Emperauger, Cheng Chen, Thierry Lahaye, Stefan Kienle, Antoine Browaeys, Annabelle Bohrdt
Abstract: Owing to their great expressivity and versatility, neural networks have gained attention for simulating large two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, their expressivity comes with the cost of a challenging optimization due to the in general rugged and complicated loss landscape. Here, we present a hybrid optimization scheme for neural quantum states (NQS), involving a data-driven pretraining with numerical or experimental data and a second, Hamiltonian-driven optimization stage. By using both projective measurements from the computational basis as well as expectation values from other measurement configurations such as spin-spin correlations, our pretraining gives access to the sign structure of the state, yielding improved and faster convergence that is robust w.r.t. experimental imperfections and limited datasets. We apply the hybrid scheme to the ground state search for the 2D transverse field Ising model and dipolar XY model on $6\times 6$ and $10\times 10$ square lattices with a patched transformer wave function, using numerical data as well as experimental data from a programmable Rydberg quantum simulator [Chen et al., Nature 616 (2023)], and show that the information from a second measurement basis highly improves the performance. Our work paves the way for a reliable and efficient optimization of neural quantum states.

Title: Nature of Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions of triple-point semimetals
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We study superconductor-barrier-superconductor (S-B-S) Josephson junctions constructed out of two-dimensional and three-dimensional triple-point semimetals, which feature a threefold degeneracy at a single nodal point. We assume a weak and homogeneous s-wave pairing in each superconducting region, and a potential difference is applied across a piece of normal-state semimetal to create the barrier region. We compute the wavefunctions of the Andreev bound states (ABSs), considering the thin-barrier limit. The appropriate boundary conditions at the S-B and B-S junctions allow us to compute the discrete energy eigenvalues $\pm |\varepsilon| $ of the ABSs. We get two distinct solutions for $|\varepsilon| $. This result differs from that in graphene and Weyl semimetals, where one obtains only one solution for $|\varepsilon| $. The multifold nature of the triple-point fermions is responsible for this difference. We also illustrate the behaviour of the Josephson current flowing across the S-B-S junction.

Title: Subdiffusive transport in the Fredkin dynamical universality class
Authors: Catherine McCarthy, Hansveer Singh, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Romain Vasseur
Abstract: We identify a pseudolocal conserved charge in the Fredkin and Motzkin quantum spin chains and explore its consequences for the hydrodynamics of systems with Fredkin- or Motzkin-type kinetic constraints. We use this quantity to formulate an exact upper bound ${\cal O}(L^{-5/2})$ on the gap of the Fredkin and Motzkin spin chains. Our results establish that transport in kinetically constrained dynamical systems with Fredkin or Motzkin constraints is subdiffusive, with dynamical exponent $z \geq 5/2$.

Title: Radio-frequency cascade readout and coherent exchange control of spin qubits fabricated using a 300 mm wafer process

Abstract: Leveraging advanced semiconductor manufacturing promises potential for scaling up silicon-based quantum processors. In this context, control and readout of individual spin qubits have been shown on devices manufactured on 300 mm wafer metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes, yet quantum processors require two-qubit interactions to operate. Here, we use a 300 mm natural silicon MOS process customized for spin qubits and demonstrate coherent control of two electron spins using the spin-spin exchange interaction, which forms the basis for entangling gates such as $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We observe gate dephasing times of up to $T_2^{*}\approx500$ ns and a gate quality factor of $10$. For readout, we introduce a novel dispersive readout technique, the radio-frequency electron cascade, that simplifies the qubits unit cell while providing high gain. We achieve a $74\%$ singlet-triplet readout fidelity in $8~\mu$s integration time, the highest-performing dispersive readout demonstration on a planar MOS process. The combination of sensitive dispersive readout with industrial-grade manufacturing marks a crucial step towards the large-scale integration of silicon quantum processors.

Title: Experimental realization of entanglement between two Brownian particles
Authors: Lakshmanan Theerthagiri, Sergio Ciliberto
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the statistical properties of the quantum analog of entanglement between two electric circuits equivalent to two Brownian particles connected by an elastic force and maintained at different temperatures through separate heat reservoirs. Uncertainty relations between coordinates and coarse-grained velocity can produce a phenomenon similar to quantum entanglement, where temperature plays the role of Planck's constant. The theoretical analysis matches the experimental results, confirming that the interconnected particles exhibit Brownian quantum-inspired classical correlation entanglement. This effect arises from a coarse grained description of Brownian motion and vanishes at a finer resolution. {The coarsening scales range is measured too.

Title: Interplay between evanescent scattering modes and finite dispersion in superconducting junctions
Authors: Daniel Kruti, Roman-Pascal Riwar
Abstract: Superconducting junctions are essential building blocks for quantum hardware, and their fundamental behaviour remains a highly active research field. The behaviour of generic junctions is conveniently described by Beenakker's determinant formula, linking the subgap energy spectrum to the scattering matrix characterising the junction. In particular, the gap closing between bound and continuum states in short junctions follows from unitarity of the scattering matrix, and thus, from probability conservation. In this work, we critically reassess two assumptions: that scattering in short junctions is approximately energy-independent and dominated by planar channels. We argue that strongly energy-dependant scattering follows from finite dispersion of the conductor electrons even when they spend little time within the scattering region, and show that evanescent modes play a central role when cross-channel scattering is important. By generalising Beenakker's equation and performing a mapping to an effective Hamiltonian, we show that the gap closing is linked to a chiral symmetry. While finite energy dependence in the scattering breaks the chiral symmetry, we show two distinct mechanisms preserving the gap closing, each connected to new types of constraints on energy-dependant scattering matrices beyond unitarity. If the dispersive mode is planar, the gap closing is still preserved through a time-dependant probability conservation analysis of the scattering process. If the dispersive channel is evanescent, we derive a constraint which, notably, cannot follow from probability conservation. We thus demonstrate that Andreev physics reveal a much wider variety of properties of normal-metal scattering than commonly expected. We expect that our findings will have an impact on the dissipative behaviour of driven junctions, and offer a new perspective on fundamental properties of scattering matrices.

Title: Nanoscale Domain Wall Dynamics in Micromagnetic Structures with Weak Perpendicular Anisotropy
Authors: Tim A. Butcher, Nicholas W. Phillips, Abraham L. Levitan, Markus Weigand, Sebastian Wintz, Jörg Raabe, Simone Finizio
Abstract: Time-resolved pump-probe soft X-ray ptychography and Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) were employed to study the magnetic domain wall dynamics in microstructures of permalloy (Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$; Py) with a weak growth-induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) images of a micrometer-sized Py square (160 nm thickness) and an elliptical disk (80 nm thickness) show flux-closure patterns with domain walls that fall into alternating out-of-plane (OOP) magnetization states precipitated by the perpendicular anisotropy, which is a precursor of the nucleation of stripe domains at higher thicknesses. An oscillating magnetic field at frequencies from tens of MHz to GHz and up to 4 mT magnitude excited dynamic modes in the domain walls along with the vortex core gyration. The domain wall dynamics include the translation of inversion points of the OOP magnetization and nucleation of one-dimensional spin waves.

Title: Multipolar multiferroics in $4d^2$/$5d^2$ Mott insulators
Authors: Saikat Banerjee, Stephan Humeniuk, Alan R. Bishop, Avadh Saxena, Alexander V. Balatsky
Abstract: We extend the concept of conventional multiferroicity \ -- where ferroelectric and ferromagnetic orders coexist \ -- to include multipolar degrees of freedom. Specifically, we explore how this phenomenon emerges in $4d^2/5d^2$ Mott insulators with strong spin-orbit and Hund's couplings. Our study uncovers the origin of magnetic multipolar interactions in these systems and demonstrates that a combination of quadrupolar and octupolar magnetic order can simultaneously induce both electrical quadrupolar moments and ferroelectric polarization. By expanding the multiferroic framework to higher-order multipoles, we reveal the possibility of coexisting multipolar orders of different or same ranks, paving the way for new functional properties in a large class of strongly correlated materials.

Title: Interaction imbalanced spin-orbit coupled quantum droplets
Authors: Sonali Gangwar, Rajamanickam Ravisankar, S. I. Mistakidis, Paulsamy Muruganandam, Pankaj Kumar Mishra
Abstract: We explore the ground states and quench dynamics of one-dimensional quantum droplets with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and an imbalance in intracomponent interactions. A plethora of miscible ground state stripe and standard (i.e., non-modulated) droplets is found depending on the SOC wavenumber and building upon Gaussian to flat-top background for increasing (decreasing) atom number (interactions). Deformations among the states were accompanied by spin population transfer caused by the Rabi coupling and could be controlled by adjusting the interactions or the SOC parameters. When considering a trap, we identified a transition from a bound to a trapped gas many-body state, characterized by a sign change of the chemical potential, which occurred at lower (larger) atom numbers for tighter traps (stronger interactions). The droplet's breathing motion was accompanied by minor population transfer, and its frequency increases for a larger intracomponent interaction ratio or reaching a maximum at SOC wavenumbers, where the transition from non-modulated flat-top to stripe droplets occurred. We witness droplet fragmentation for abrupt changes in the Rabi coupling while large amplitude quenches of the SOC wavenumber trigger spin-demixing, resulting in constant amplitude but opposite direction motion of untrapped droplets or in-trap out-of-phase oscillating droplets. Our findings have implications for controlled spin-demixing processes of droplets and the excitation of relevant magnetic bound states.

Title: Microscopic theory of the Hubbard interaction in low-dimensional optical lattices
Authors: Haydn S. Adlong, Jesper Levinsen, Meera M. Parish
Abstract: The Hubbard model is a paradigmatic model of strongly correlated quantum matter, thus making it desirable to investigate with quantum simulators such as ultracold atomic gases. Here, we consider the problem of two atoms interacting in a quasi-one- or quasi-two-dimensional optical lattice, geometries which are routinely realized in quantum-gas-microscope experiments. We perform an exact calculation of the low-energy scattering amplitude which accounts for the effects of the transverse confinement as well as all higher Bloch bands. This goes beyond standard perturbative treatments and allows us to precisely determine the effective Hubbard on-site interaction for arbitrary $s$-wave scattering length (see source code available at [1]). In particular, we find that the Hubbard on-site interaction displays lattice-induced resonances for scattering lengths on the order of the lattice spacing, which are well within reach of current experiments. Furthermore, we show that our results are in excellent agreement with spectroscopic measurements of the Hubbard interaction for a quasi-two-dimensional square optical lattice in a quantum gas microscope. Our formalism is very general and may be extended to multi-band models and other atom-like scenarios in lattice geometries, such as exciton-exciton and exciton-electron scattering in moiré superlattices.

Title: Quantum Monte Carlo and density functional theory study of strain and magnetism in 2D 1T-VSe$_2$ with charge density wave states
Authors: Daniel Wines, Akram Ibrahim, Nishwanth Gudibandla, Tehseen Adel, Frank M. Abel, Sharadh Jois, Kayahan Saritas, Jaron T. Krogel, Li Yin, Tom Berlijn, Aubrey T. Hanbicki, Gregory M. Stephen, Adam L. Friedman, Sergiy Krylyuk, Albert V. Davydov, Brian Donovan, Michelle E. Jamer, Angela R. Hight Walker, Kamal Choudhary, Francesca Tavazza, Can Ataca
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) 1T-VSe$_2$ has prompted significant interest due to the discrepancies regarding alleged ferromagnetism (FM) at room temperature, charge density wave (CDW) states and the interplay between the two. We employed a combined Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and density functional theory (DFT) approach to accurately investigate the magnetic properties, CDW states, and their response to strain in monolayer 1T-VSe$_2$. Our calculations show the delicate competition between various phases, revealing critical insights into the relationship between their energetic and structural properties. We performed classical Monte Carlo simulations informed by our DMC and DFT results, and found the magnetic transition temperature ($T_c$) of the undistorted (non-CDW) FM phase to be 228 K and the distorted (CDW) phase to be 68 K. Additionally, we studied the response of biaxial strain on the energetic stability and magnetic properties of various phases of 2D 1T-VSe$_2$ and found that small amounts of strain can increase the $T_c$, suggesting a promising route for engineering and enhancing magnetic behavior. Finally, we synthesized 1T-VSe$_2$ and performed Raman spectroscopy measurements, which were in close agreement with our calculated results, validating our computational approach. Our work emphasizes the role of highly accurate DMC methods in advancing the understanding of monolayer 1T-VSe$_2$ and provides a robust framework for future studies of 2D magnetic materials.

Title: Nonperturbative calculation of exchange coupling parameters
Authors: Tomonori Tanaka, Yoshihiro Gohda
Abstract: Exchange coupling parameters $J_{ij}$ within the Heisenberg model and its extensions are crucial for understanding magnetic behavior at the atomic level. To calculate $J_{ij}$ from first principles, perturbative methods based on the magnetic force theorem (MFT), commonly referred to as Liechtenstein's method, have been widely employed. However, the quantitative accuracy of $J_{ij}$ obtained through this perturbative technique remains uncertain. In this paper, we nonperturbatively calculate $J_{ij}$ for several systems of both fundamental and applied significance, including perovskite SrMnO$_3$, neodymium-magnet compounds, and elemental 3$d$ transition metals, and compare these results with those obtained using the conventional MFT-based method. The nonperturbative approach provides consistent results for magnetic configurations exhibiting a certain degree of magnetic disorder. In contrast, due to its inherent theoretical limitations, the MFT-based method struggles to accurately evaluate the magnetic energy in such configurations. As discussed later in this paper, these discrepancies arise from neglected contributions within MFT-based methods. Our nonperturbative scheme is highly versatile and holds strong prospects as a new platform for analyzing and designing spintronic materials, where developing accurate spin models is essential.

Title: Lattice thermal conductivity in the anharmonic overdamped regime
Authors: Đorđe Dangić, Giovanni Caldarelli, Raffaello Bianco, Ivana Savić, Ion Errea
Abstract: In crystalline materials, low lattice thermal conductivity is often associated with strong anharmonicity, which can cause significant deviations from the expected Lorentzian lineshape of phonon spectral functions. These deviations, occurring in an overdamped regime, raise questions about the applicability of the Boltzmann transport equation. Furthermore, strong anharmonicity can trigger structural phase transitions with temperature, which cannot be adequately described by the standard harmonic approximation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for computing the lattice thermal conductivity. Our method combines the Green-Kubo linear response theory with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. The latter allows us to describe the temperature-dependent evolution of the crystal structure, including first- and second-order phase transitions, as well as the vibrational properties in highly anharmonic materials. The Green-Kubo method considers the entire lineshapes of phonon spectral functions in the calculation of the lattice thermal conductivity, thus eliminating the questionable use of phonon lifetimes in the overdamped regime, as well as naturally including coherent transport effects. Additionally, we extend our theory to model complex dynamical lattice thermal conductivity, enhancing our understanding of time-dependent thermoreflectance experiments. As a practical application, we employ this approach to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity of CsPbBr$_3$, a complex crystal known for its anomalous thermal transport behavior with a complex phase diagram. Our method is able to determine the thermal conductivity across different phases in good agreement with experiments.

Title: Weak Ferromagnetism in Altermagnets from Alternating $g$-Tensor Anisotropy
Authors: Daegeun Jo, Dongwook Go, Yuriy Mokrousov, Peter M. Oppeneer, Sang-Wook Cheong, Hyun-Woo Lee
Abstract: Altermagnets are magnetic materials with antiferromagnetic spin ordering but exhibit ferromagnetic properties. Understanding the microscopic origin of the latter is a central problem. Ferromagnet-like properties such as the anomalous Hall effect are linked with weak ferromagnetism, whose microscopic origin in altermagnets remains unclear however. We show theoretically that the alternating $g$-tensor anisotropy in altermagnets can induce weak ferromagnetism even when the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is forbidden. We demonstrate this mechanism to explain weak ferromagnetism for both collinear and noncollinear spin altermagnets. Our findings provide new insights into the origin of weak ferromagnetism and suggest orbital-based ways for manipulating magnetic configurations in altermagnets.

Title: Classical Geometric Fluctuation Relations
Authors: Pedro B. Melo, Sílvio M. Duarte Queirós, Diogo O. Soares-Pinto, Welles A. M. Morgado
Abstract: Fisher Information (FI) is a quantity ubiquitously measured in such varied areas like metrology, machine learning, and biological complexity. Mathematically, it represents a lower bound in the variance of unknown parameters that are related to the distributions one has access, and a metric for probability manifolds. A stochastic analogous of the Fisher Information, dubbed stochastic Fisher Information was recently introduced in the literature by some of us. By exploring the probability distributions of the Stochastic Fisher Information (SFI), we uncover two fluctuation relations with an inherent geometric nature, as the SFI acts as a single nonequilibrium trajectory metric. The geometric nature of these relations is expressed through a stochastic length in entropy space derived from the system entropy associated with a nonequilibrium trajectory. We also explore the possibility of trajectory-dependent uncertainty relations linked to the SFI with time as a parameter. Finally, we test our geometric fluctuation relations using two nonequilibrium models.

Title: Al0.68Sc0.32N/SiC based metal-ferroelectric-semiconductor capacitors operating up to 1000 °C
Authors: Yunfei He, David C. Moore, Yubo Wang, Spencer Ware, Sizhe Ma, Dhiren K. Pradhan, Zekun Hu, Xingyu Du, W. Joshua Kennedy, Nicholas R. Glavin, Roy H. Olsson III, Deep Jariwala
Abstract: Ferroelectric (Fe) materials-based devices show great promise for non-volatile memory applications, yet few demonstrate reliable operation at elevated temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate Ni/Al0.68Sc0.32N/4H-SiC metal-ferroelectric-semiconductor capacitors for high-temperature non-volatile memory applications. Our 30-nm thick ferroelectric Al0.68Sc0.32N film grown on SiC exhibits stable and robust ferroelectric switching up to 1000°C. The coercive field decreases linearly from -6.4/+11.9 MV cm-1 at room temperature to -3.1/+7.8 MV cm-1 at 800°C, further reducing to -2.5 MV cm-1 at 1000°C. At 600°C, the devices achieve remarkable reliability with ~2000 endurance cycles and over at least 100 hours of retention with negligible polarization loss. At 800°C, the devices retain data for at least 10,000 seconds and exceed 400 write cycles. Our results further highlight the potential for ferroelectric AlScN thin-films particularly when paired with SiC semiconductor substrates for high-temperature non-volatile memory.

Title: A Generator of Neural Network Potential for Molecular Dynamics: Constructing Robust and Accurate Potentials with Active Learning for Nanosecond-scale Simulations
Authors: Naoki Matsumura, Yuta Yoshimoto, Tamio Yamazaki, Tomohito Amano, Tomoyuki Noda, Naoki Ebata, Takatoshi Kasano, Yasufumi Sakai
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing >10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial dataset creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with >10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.

Title: CHIPS-FF: Evaluating Universal Machine Learning Force Fields for Material Properties
Authors: Daniel Wines, Kamal Choudhary
Abstract: In this work, we introduce CHIPS-FF (Computational High-Performance Infrastructure for Predictive Simulation-based Force Fields), a universal, open-source benchmarking platform for machine learning force fields (MLFFs). This platform provides robust evaluation beyond conventional metrics such as energy, focusing on complex properties including elastic constants, phonon spectra, defect formation energies, surface energies, and interfacial and amorphous phase properties. Utilizing 16 graph-based MLFF models including ALIGNN-FF, CHGNet, MatGL, MACE, SevenNet, ORB, MatterSim and OMat24, the CHIPS-FF workflow integrates the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) with JARVIS-Tools to facilitate automated high-throughput simulations. Our framework is tested on a set of 104 materials, including metals, semiconductors and insulators representative of those used in semiconductor components, with each MLFF evaluated for convergence, accuracy, and computational cost. Additionally, we evaluate the force-prediction accuracy of these models for close to 2 million atomic structures. By offering a streamlined, flexible benchmarking infrastructure, CHIPS-FF aims to guide the development and deployment of MLFFs for real-world semiconductor applications, bridging the gap between quantum mechanical simulations and large-scale device modeling.

Title: Complete classification of integrability and non-integrability of S=1/2 spin chains with symmetric next-nearest-neighbor interaction
Authors: Naoto Shiraishi
Abstract: We study S=1/2 quantum spin chains with shift-invariant and inversion-symmetric next-nearest-neighbor interaction, also known as zigzag spin chains. We completely classify the integrability and non-integrability of the above class of spin systems. We prove that in this class there are only two integrable models, a classical model and a model solvable by the Bethe ansatz, and all the remaining systems are non-integrable. Our classification theorem confirms that within this class of spin chains, there is no missing integrable model. This theorem also implies the absence of intermediate models with a finite number of local conserved quantities.

Title: Dynamics of Baxter-Wu model
Authors: Chen Tang, Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Wanzhou Zhang, Chengxiang Ding
Abstract: Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the dynamical properties of the Baxter-Wu (BW) model under linear quenches. For the linear cooling process, the scaling behavior of the excess defect density in the critical region aligns well with the predictions of the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism. However, the scaling behavior of the excess defect density after exiting the impulse regime does not follow from a simple interplay between the KZ mechanism and the coarsening dynamics; the system undergoes a decay close to a power-law form with an exponent that is significantly different from the coarsening exponent observed in instantaneous quenching. For the linear heating process, we show that, if the system starts from its ground state, the relevant exponents describing the KZ mechanism are identical to those in the cooling scenario. We find that the system does not directly enter the adiabatic regime after leaving the impulse regime but instead passes through a crossover regime with an exponential decay of the excess defect density. If the initial state is ordered but not the ground state of the system, the defect density exhibits a good scaling behavior, but the relevant exponents do not conform to the predictions of the KZ mechanism.

Title: Modeling and computation of the effective elastic behavior of parallelogram origami metamaterials
Authors: Hu Xu, Frederic Marazzato, Paul Plucinsky
Abstract: Origami metamaterials made of repeating unit cells of parallelogram panels joined at folds dramatically change their shape through a collective motion of their cells. Here we develop an effective elastic model and numerical method to study the large deformation response of these metamaterials under a broad class of loads. The model builds on an effective plate theory derived in our prior work [64]. The theory captures the overall shape change of all slightly stressed parallelogram origami deformations through nonlinear geometric compatibility constraints that couple the origami's (cell averaged) effective deformation to an auxiliary angle field quantifying its cell-by-cell actuation. It also assigns to each such origami deformation a plate energy associated to these effective fields. Seeking a constitutive model that is faithful to the theory but also practical to simulate, we relax the geometric constraints via corresponding elastic energy penalties; we also simplify the plate energy density to embrace its essential character as a regularization to the geometric penalties. The resulting model for parallelogram origami is a generalized elastic continuum that is nonlinear in the effective deformation gradient and angle field and regularized by high-order gradients thereof. We provide a finite element formulation of this model using the $C^0$ interior penalty method to handle second gradients of deformation, and implement it using the open source computing platform Firedrake. We end by using the model and numerical method to study two canonical parallelogram origami patterns, in Miura and Eggbox origami, under a variety of loading conditions.

Title: A Jellium Model for the Anomalous Hall Crystal
Authors: Tomohiro Soejima, Junkai Dong, Ashvin Vishwanath, Daniel E. Parker
Abstract: The jellium model is a paradigmatic problem in condensed matter physics, exhibiting a phase transition between metallic and Wigner crystal phases. However, its vanishing Berry curvature makes it ill-suited for studying recent experimental platforms that combine strong interactions with nontrivial quantum geometry. These experiments inspired the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) -- a topological variant of the Wigner crystal. The AHC spontaneously breaks continuous translation symmetry but has a nonzero Chern number. In this work, we introduce $\lambda-$jellium, a minimal extension of the two-dimensional jellium model. Its Berry curvature distribution is controlled by a single parameter, $\lambda$, where $\lambda=0$ corresponds to the standard jellium model. This setup facilitates the systematic exploration of Berry curvature's impact on electron crystallization. The phase diagram of this model, established using self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations, reveals several interesting features: (i) The AHC phase occupies a large region of the phase diagram. (ii) Two distinct Wigner crystal phases, the latter enabled by quantum geometry, and two distinct Fermi liquid phases are present. (iii) A continuous phase transition separates the AHC and one of the WC phases. (iv) In some parts of the AHC phase, the lattice geometry is non-triangular, unlike in the classical Wigner crystal. In addition to elucidating the physics of correlated electrons with nonzero Berry curvature, we expect that the simplicity of the model makes it an excellent starting point for more advanced numerical methods.

Title: A scalable, reproducible platform for molecular electronic technologies
Authors: Seham Helmi, Junjie Liu, Keith Andrews, Robert Schreiber, Jonathan Bath, Harry L Anderson, Andrew J Turberfield, Arzhang Ardavan
Abstract: Molecular electronics and other technologies whose components comprise individual molecules have been pursued for half a century because the molecular scale represents the limit of miniaturisation of objects whose structure is tuneable for function. Despite the promise, practical progress has been hindered by the lack of methodologies for directed assembly of arbitrary structures applicable at the molecular scale. DNA nanotechnology is an emerging framework that uses programmed synthetic oligomers to encode the design of self-assembling structures with atomic precision at the nanoscale. Here, we leverage DNA-directed self-assembly to construct single-molecule electrical transport devices in high yield, precisely positioning a metal-porphyrin between two 60 nm gold nanoparticles. Following deposition on SiO2 substrates, we image and establish electrical contact via established nanofabrication techniques. Each step of the process has a high probability of success and we demonstrate device yields dramatically better than is possible using conventional approaches. Our approach is inherently scalable and adaptable to devices incorporating multiple heterogenous functional molecular components, finally offering a realistic framework for the realisation of classical and quantum molecular technologies.

Title: Quantized Magneto-Terahertz Effects in the Antiferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ Thin Films
Authors: Xingyue Han, An-Hsi Chen, Matthew Brahlek, Liang Wu
Abstract: MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) is an ideal platform for studying the interplay between magnetism and topology. Many exotic topological phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the axion insulator, have been observed in few-layer MBT. A key feature in MBT is the emergence of the surface exchange gap, which lies in the milli-electron-volt range (1 THz corresponds to 4.14 meV). This makes THz spectroscopy a powerful tool to probe the associated topological physics. In this study, we report the THz spectra of Faraday and Kerr rotations in MBT thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By varying the external magnetic field, we observe three magnetic states: the antiferromagnetic state, the canted antiferromagnetic state, and the ferromagnetic state. Our terahertz results show a quantized Hall state under 6 T in both 6 SL and 7 SL samples without gate voltage. These findings provide new insights into the magneto-terahertz properties of MBT and its potential for topological spintronic applications.

Title: Quantum transport in the presence of a chiral molecular potential
Authors: Ragheed Alhyder, Mikhail Lemeshko, Alberto Cappellaro
Abstract: We investigate quantum transport in a two-dimensional electron system coupled to a chiral molecular potential, demonstrating how molecular chirality and orientation affect charge and spin transport properties. We propose a minimal model for realizing true chiral symmetry breaking on a magnetized surface, with a crucial role played by the tilt angle of the molecular dipole with respect to the surface. For non-zero tilting, we show that the Hall response exhibits clear signatures of chirality-induced effects, both in charge and spin-resolved observables. Concerning the former, tilted enantiomers produce asymmetric Hall conductances and, even more remarkably, the persistence of this feature in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) signals how the enantiospecific charge response results from electron scattering off the molecular potential. Concerning spin-resolved observables where SOC plays a relevant role, we reveal that chiral symmetry breaking is crucial in enabling spin-flipping processes.

Title: An empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics for simulating and predicting microstructure evolution in materials
Authors: Liang Wan, Qingsong Mei, Haowen Liu, Huafeng Zhang, Jun-Ping Du, Shigenobu Ogata, Wen Tong Geng
Abstract: Despite its widespread use in materials science, conventional molecular dynamics simulations are severely constrained by timescale limitations. To address this shortcoming, we propose an empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics method, adapted from a collective-variable-based extended system dynamics framework. While this framework is originally developed for efficient free energy sampling and reaction pathway determination of specific rare events in condensed matter, we have modified it to enable accelerated molecular dynamics simulation and prediction of microstructure evolution of materials across a broad range of scenarios. In essence, the nearest neighbor off-centering absolute displacement (NNOAD), which quantifies the deviation of an atom from the geometric center of its nearest neighbors in materials, is introduced. We propose that the collection of NNOADs of all atoms can serve as a generalized reaction coordinate for various structural transitions in materials. The NNOAD of each atom, represented by its three components, is coupled with three additional dynamic variables assigned to the atom. Time evolution of the additional dynamic variables follows Langevin equation, while Nosé-Hoover dynamics is employed to thermostat the system. Through careful analysis and benchmark simulations, we established appropriate parameter ranges for the equations in our method. Application of this method to several test cases demonstrates its effectiveness and consistency in accelerating molecular dynamics simulations and predicting various microstructure evolutions of materials over much longer timescale. We also provide a preliminary theoretical analysis and qualitative justification of the method, offering insights into its underlying principles.

Title: Foundation of classical dynamical density functional theory: uniqueness of time-dependent density-potential mappings
Authors: Michael Andreas Klatt, Christian Bair, Hartmut Löwen, René Wittmann
Abstract: When can we map a classical density profile to an external potential? In equilibrium, without time dependence, the one-body density is known to specify the external potential that is applied to the many-body system. This mapping from a density to the potential is the cornerstone of classical density functional theory (DFT). Here, we consider non-equilibrium, time-dependent many-body systems that evolve from a given initial condition. We derive explicit conditions, for example, no flux at the boundary, that ensure that the mapping from the density to a time-dependent external potential is unique. We thus prove the underlying assertion of dynamical density functional theory (DDFT), without resorting to the so-called adiabatic approximation often used in applications. By ascertaining uniqueness for all $n$-body densities, we ensure that the proof and the physical conclusions drawn from it hold for general superadiabatic dynamics of interacting systems even in the presence of (known) non-conservative forces.

Title: Thermally driven quantum refrigerator autonomously resets superconducting qubit
Authors: Mohammed Ali Aamir, Paul Jamet Suria, José Antonio Marín Guzmán, Claudia Castillo-Moreno, Jeffrey M. Epstein, Nicole Yunger Halpern, Simone Gasparinetti
Abstract: Although classical thermal machines power industries and modern living, quantum thermal engines have yet to prove their utility. Here, we demonstrate a useful quantum absorption refrigerator formed from superconducting circuits. We use it to cool a transmon qubit to a temperature lower than that achievable with any one available bath, thereby resetting the qubit to an initial state suitable for quantum computing. The process is driven by a thermal gradient and is autonomous, requiring no external feedback. The refrigerator exploits an engineered three-body interaction between the target qubit and two auxiliary qudits. Each auxiliary qudit is coupled to a physical heat bath, realized with a microwave waveguide populated with synthesized quasithermal radiation. If the target qubit is initially fully excited, its effective temperature reaches a steady-state level of approximately 22~mK, lower than what can be achieved by existing state-of-the-art reset protocols. Our results demonstrate that superconducting circuits with propagating thermal fields can be used to experimentally explore quantum thermodynamics and apply it to quantum information-processing tasks.

Title: Dynamics of Pseudoentanglement
Authors: Xiaozhou Feng, Matteo Ippoliti
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum entanglement plays a central role in explaining the emergence of thermal equilibrium in isolated many-body systems. However, entanglement is notoriously hard to measure. Recent works have introduced a notion of pseudoentanglement describing ensembles of many-body states that, while only weakly entangled, cannot be efficiently distinguished from states with much higher entanglement, such as random states in the Hilbert space. This prompts the question: how much entanglement is truly necessary to achieve thermal equilibrium in quantum systems? In this work we address this question by introducing random circuit models of quantum dynamics that, at late times, equilibrate to pseudoentangled ensembles -- a phenomenon we name ensemble pseudothermalization. These models replicate all the efficiently observable predictions of thermal equilibrium, while generating only a small (and tunable) amount of entanglement. We examine (i) how a pseudoentangled ensemble on a small subsystem spreads to the whole system as a function of time, and (ii) how a pseudoentangled ensemble can be generated from an initial product state. We map the above problems onto a family of classical Markov chains on subsets of the computational basis. The mixing times of such Markov chains are related to the time scales at which the states produced from the dynamics become indistinguishable from Haar-random states at the level of each statistical moment, or number of copies. Based on a combination of rigorous bounds and conjectures supported by numerics, we argue that each Markov chain's relaxation time and mixing time have different asymptotic behavior in the limit of large system size. This is a necessary condition for a cutoff phenomenon: an abrupt dynamical transition to equilibrium. We thus conjecture that our random circuits give rise to asymptotically sharp distinguishability transitions.

Title: Simple crowd dynamics to generate complex temporal contact networks
Authors: Razieh Masoumi, Juliette Gambaudo, Mathieu Génois
Abstract: Empirical contact networks or interaction networks demonstrate peculiar characteristics stemming from the fundamental social, psychological, physical mechanisms governing human interactions. Although these mechanisms are complex, we test whether we are able to reproduce some dynamical properties of these empirical networks from relatively simple models. In this study, we perform simulations for a range of 2D models of particle dynamics, namely the Random Walk, Active Brownian Particles, and Vicsek models, to generate artificial contact networks. We investigate temporal properties of these contact networks: the distributions of contact durations, inter-contact durations and number of contact per pair of particle. We demonstrate that the distribution of inter-contact durations can be recovered by the dynamics of these simple crowd particle models, and show that it is simply related to the well-know first-return process, which explains the -3/2 exponent that is found in both the numerical models and empirical contact networks.

Title: Tunably-polarized driving light controls the phase diagram of 1D quasicrystals and 2D quantum Hall matter
Authors: Yifei Bai, David M. Weld
Abstract: The well-known mapping between 1D quasiperiodic systems and 2D integer quantum Hall matter can also be applied in the presence of driving. Here we explore the effect of time-varying electric fields on the transport properties and phase diagram of Harper-Hofstadter materials. We consider light of arbitrary polarization illuminating a 2D electron gas at high magnetic field; this system maps to a 1D quasicrystal subjected to simultaneous phasonic and dipolar driving. We show that this generalized driving generates a tessellated phase diagram featuring a nested duality-protected pattern of metal-insulator transitions. Circularly or elliptically polarized light can create an extended critical phase, opening up a new route to achieving wavefunction multifractality without fine-tuning to a critical point. We describe in detail a path to experimental realization of these phenomena using lattice-trapped ultracold atoms.

Title: High-purity and stable single-photon emission in bilayer WSe$_2$ via phonon-assisted excitation
Authors: Claudia Piccinini, Athanasios Paralikis, José Ferreira Neto, Abdulmalik Abdulkadir Madigawa, Paweł Wyborski, Vikas Remesh, Luca Vannucci, Niels Gregersen, Battulga Munkhbat
Abstract: The excitation scheme is essential for single-photon sources, as it governs exciton preparation, decay dynamics, and the spectral diffusion of emitted photons. While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.

Title: Exploring $G$-ality defects in 2-dim QFTs
Authors: Da-Chuan Lu, Zhengdi Sun, Zipei Zhang
Abstract: The Tambara-Yamagami (TY) fusion category symmetry $\text{TY}(\mathbb{A},\chi,\epsilon)$ describes the enhanced non-invertible self-duality symmetry of a $2$-dim QFT under gauging a finite Abelian group $\mathbb{A}$. We generalize the enhanced non-invertible symmetries by considering twisted gauging which allows stacking $\mathbb{A}$-SPT before and after the gauging. Such non-invertible symmetries correspond to invertible anyon permutation symmetries of the $3$-dim SymTFT. Consider a finite group $G$ formed by (un)twisted gaugings of $\mathbb{A}$, a $2$-dim QFT invariant under topological manipulations in $G$ admits non-invertible $\textit{$G$-ality defects}$. We study the classification and the physical implication of the $G$-ality defects using SymTFT and the group-theoretical fusion categories, with three concrete examples. 1) Triality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ where $N$ is coprime with $3$. The classification is acquired previously by Jordan and Larson where the data is similar to the $\text{TY}$ fusion categories, and we determine the anomaly of these fusion categories. 2) $p$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p$ is an odd prime. We consider two such categories $\mathcal{P}_{\pm,m}$ which are distinguished by different choices of the symmetry fractionalization, a new data that does not appear in the TY classification, and show that they have distinct anomaly structures and spin selection rules. 3) $S_3$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$. We study their classification explicitly for $N < 20$ via SymTFT, and provide a group-theoretical construction for certain $N$. We find $N=5$ is the minimal $N$ to admit an $S_3$-ality and $N=11$ is the minimal $N$ to admit a group-theoretical $S_3$-ality.

Title: Vector Resonant Relaxation and Statistical Closure Theory. I. Direct Interaction Approximation
Authors: Sofia Flores, Jean-Baptiste Fouvry
Abstract: Stars orbiting a supermassive black hole in the center of galaxies undergo very efficient diffusion in their orbital orientations: this is "Vector Resonant Relaxation". Such a dynamics is intrinsically non-linear, stochastic, and correlated, hence bearing deep similarities with turbulence in fluid mechanics or plasma physics. In that context, we show how generic methods stemming from statistical closure theory, namely the celebrated "Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism", can be used to characterize the correlations describing the redistribution of orbital orientations. In particular, limiting ourselves to the leading order truncation in this closure scheme, the so-called "Direct Interaction Approximation", and placing ourselves in the limit of an isotropic distribution of orientations, we explicitly compare the associated prediction for the two-point correlation function with measures from numerical simulations. We discuss the successes and limitations of this approach and present possible future venues.

Title: A symmetry-based approach to species-rich ecological communities
Authors: Juan Giral Martínez
Abstract: Disordered systems theory provides powerful tools to analyze the generic behaviors of highdimensional systems, such as species-rich ecological communities or neural networks. By assuming randomness in their interactions, universality ensures that many microscopic details are irrelevant to system-wide dynamics; but the choice of a random ensemble still limits the generality of results. We show here, in the context of ecological dynamics, that these analytical tools do not require a specific choice of ensemble, and that solutions can be found based only on a fundamental rotational symmetry in the interactions, encoding the idea that traits can be recombined into new species without altering global features. Dynamical outcomes then depend on the spectrum of the interaction matrix as a free parameter, allowing us to bridge between results found in different models of interactions, and extend beyond them to previously unidentified behaviors. The distinctive feature of ecological models is the possibility of species extinctions, which leads to an increased universality of dynamics as the fraction of extinct species increases. We expect that these findings can inform new developments in theoretical ecology as well as for other families of complex systems.

Title: Many-Body Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Rosario Fazio, Jonathan Keeling, Leonardo Mazza, Marco Schirò
Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.

Title: Geometric contribution to adiabatic amplification in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Tomoki Ozawa, Henning Schomerus
Abstract: Concepts from non-Hermitian quantum mechanics have proven useful in understanding and manipulating a variety of classical systems, such as those encountered in optics, classical mechanics, and metamaterial design. Recently, the non-Hermitian analog of the Berry phase for adiabatic processes was experimentally measured. In non-Hermitian systems, the Berry phase can have an imaginary part, which contributes to the amplification or decay of the total wave intensity. When the imaginary part of the Berry curvature is zero, this geometric amplification factor is determined solely by the initial and final points of the adiabatic path in parameter space, and it does not depend on how these points are connected by the path. We list classes of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians where this path independence is guaranteed by suitable symmetries, and we find that, for some of these classes, the amplification factor can be written only in terms of the Petermann factors of the initial and final points. Our result can, in turn, be used to experimentally obtain the Petermann factor by observing how the norm of the wave function changes under adiabatic processes. We validate our theory using a couple of concrete examples of physical relevance.

Title: MOFFlow: Flow Matching for Structure Prediction of Metal-Organic Frameworks
Authors: Nayoung Kim, Seongsu Kim, Minsu Kim, Jinkyoo Park, Sungsoo Ahn
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline materials with promising applications in many areas such as carbon capture and drug delivery. In this work, we introduce MOFFlow, the first deep generative model tailored for MOF structure prediction. Existing approaches, including ab initio calculations and even deep generative models, struggle with the complexity of MOF structures due to the large number of atoms in the unit cells. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Riemannian flow matching framework that reduces the dimensionality of the problem by treating the metal nodes and organic linkers as rigid bodies, capitalizing on the inherent modularity of MOFs. By operating in the $SE(3)$ space, MOFFlow effectively captures the roto-translational dynamics of these rigid components in a scalable way. Our experiment demonstrates that MOFFlow accurately predicts MOF structures containing several hundred atoms, significantly outperforming conventional methods and state-of-the-art machine learning baselines while being much faster.

Title: Generalized many-body perturbation theory for the electron correlation energy: multi-reference random phase approximation via diagrammatic resummation
Authors: Yuqi Wang, Wei-Hai Fang, Zhendong Li
Abstract: Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) based on Green's functions and Feynman diagrams provides a fundamental theoretical framework for various \emph{ab initio} computational approaches in molecular and materials science, including the random phase approximation (RPA) and $GW$ approximation. Unfortunately, this perturbation expansion often fails in systems with strong multi-reference characters. Extending diagrammatic MBPT to the multi-reference case is highly nontrivial and remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the breakdown of Wick's theorem. In this work, we develop a diagrammatic multi-reference generalization of MBPT for computing correlation energies of strongly correlated systems, by using the cumulant expansion of many-body Green's function in place of Wick's theorem. This theoretical framework bridges the gap between MBPT in condensed matter physics and multi-reference perturbation theories (MRPT) in quantum chemistry, which had been almost exclusively formulated within time-independent wavefunction frameworks prior to this work. Our formulation enables the explicit incorporation of strong correlation effects from the outset as in MRPT, while treating residual weak interactions through a generalized diagrammatic perturbation expansion as in MBPT. As a concrete demonstration, we formulate a multi-reference (MR) extension of the standard single-reference (SR) RPA by systematically resumming generalized ring diagrams, which naturally leads to a unified set of equations applicable to both SR and MR cases. Benchmark calculations on prototypical molecular systems reveal that MR-RPA successfully resolves the well-known failure of SR-RPA in strongly correlated systems. This theoretical advancement paves the way for advancing \emph{ab initio} computational methods through diagrammatic resummation techniques in future.

Title: Information-theoretic limits and approximate message-passing for high-dimensional time series
Authors: Daria Tieplova, Samriddha Lahiry, Jean Barbier
Abstract: High-dimensional time series appear in many scientific setups, demanding a nuanced approach to model and analyze the underlying dependence structure. Theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signal. In non-sparse regimes, analyses have primarily focused on linear regression models with the design matrix having independent rows. In this paper, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal, as well as for minimum mean-square errors. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing VAMP algorithm and show that, despite the lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.

Title: Tensor Completion for Surrogate Modeling of Material Property Prediction
Authors: Shaan Pakala, Dawon Ahn, Evangelos Papalexakis
Abstract: When designing materials to optimize certain properties, there are often many possible configurations of designs that need to be explored. For example, the materials' composition of elements will affect properties such as strength or conductivity, which are necessary to know when developing new materials. Exploring all combinations of elements to find optimal materials becomes very time consuming, especially when there are more design variables. For this reason, there is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to predict a material's properties. In this work, we model the optimization of certain material properties as a tensor completion problem, to leverage the structure of our datasets and navigate the vast number of combinations of material configurations. Across a variety of material property prediction tasks, our experiments show tensor completion methods achieving 10-20% decreased error compared with baseline ML models such as GradientBoosting and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), while maintaining similar training speed.

Title: Optimal Symbolic Construction of Matrix Product Operators and Tree Tensor Network Operators
Authors: Hazar Çakır, Richard M. Milbradt, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.

Title: Digital Simulation of Non-Abelian Parafermions in Superconducting Circuits
Authors: Hong-Yu Wang, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana fermions, exhibit profound non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding statistics of parafermion modes, and show the application of this approach to fusing and braiding the $d=3$ parafermions. We also examine the experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulation for twist defects in SC qubits to qudit systems, and may open up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.
