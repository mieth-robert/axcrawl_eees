Title: Data-Driven Approach to Hyperelastic Membranes
Authors: Claudia Grabs, Werner Wirges
Abstract: We study large deformations of hyperelastic membranes using a purely two-dimensional formulation derived from basic balance principles within a modern geometric setting, ensuring a framework that is independent of an underlying three-dimensional formulation. To assess the predictive capabilities of membrane theory, we compare numerical solutions to experimental data from axisymmetric deformations of a silicone rubber film. Five hyperelastic models - Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, Gent, Yeoh, and Ogden - are evaluated by fitting their material parameters to our experimental data using TensorFlow. Our results provide a systematic comparison of these models based on their accuracy in capturing observed deformations, establishing a framework for integrating theory, experiment, and data-driven parameter identification.

Title: Bose-Einstein Condensation and the Lambda Transition for Interacting Lennard-Jones Helium-4
Authors: Phil Attard
Abstract: An introduction to Bose-Einstein condensation and the $\lambda$-transition is given. Results of quantum loop Monte Carlo simulations are presented for interacting Lennard-Jones helium-4. The optimum condensation fraction is found by minimizing the constrained free energy. The results show that approaching the transition the growth of pure position permutation loops and the consequent divergence of the heat capacity are enabled by the suppression of condensation and consequently of superfluidity. Condensation and superfluidity emerge at the peak of the heat capacity due to mixed position permutation chains.

Title: From Continuous to First-Order-Like: Amorphous-to-Amorphous Transition in Phase-Change Materials
Authors: Tomoki Fujita, Yoshio Kono, Yuhan Chen, Jens Moesgaard, Seiya Takahashi, Arune Makareviciute, Sho Kakizawa, Davide Campi, Marco Bernasconi, Koji Ohara, Ichiro Inoue, Yujiro Hayashi, Makina Yabashi, Eiji Nishibori, Riccardo Mazzarello, Shuai Wei
Abstract: Polymorphism is ubiquitous in crystalline solids. Amorphous solids, such as glassy water and silicon, may undergo amorphous-to-amorphous transitions (AATs). The nature of AATs remains ambiguous, due to diverse system-dependent behaviors and experimental challenges to characterize disordered structures. Here, we identify two ordered motifs in amorphous phase-change materials and monitor their interplay upon pressure-induced AATs. Tuning temperature, we find a crossover from continuous to first-order-like AATs. The crossover emerges at a special pressure-temperature combination, where the AAT encounters a maximum in crystallization rate. Analyzing the two ordered motifs in a two-state model, we draw a phenomenological parallel to the phase transition behavior of supercooled water near its second critical point. This analogy raises an intriguing question regarding the existence of a critical-like point within amorphous solids.

Title: Quantum Geometry: Revisiting electronic scales in quantum matter
Authors: Nishchhal Verma, Philip J. W. Moll, Tobias Holder, Raquel Queiroz
Abstract: Electronic properties of solids are often well understood via the low energy dispersion of Bloch bands, motivating single band approximations in many metals and semiconductors. However, a closer look reveals new length and time scales introduced by quantum dipole fluctuations due to interband mixing, which are reflected in the momentum space textures of the electronic wavefunctions. This structure is usually referred to as quantum geometry. The scales introduced by geometry not only qualitatively modify the linear and nonlinear responses of a material but can also have a vital role in determining the many-body ground state. This review explores how quantum geometry impacts properties of materials and outlines recent experimental advances that have begun to explore quantum geometric effects in various condensed matter platforms. We discuss the separation of scales that can allow us to estimate the significance of quantum geometry in various response functions.

Title: Two-dimensional nonlinear optical response of a spiral magnet
Authors: Wolfram Brenig
Abstract: We study the dynamical response function relevant for two-dimensional coherent nonlinear optical spectroscopy of the antiferromagnetic frustrated $J_{1}$-$J_{3}$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice within its long-range ordered, incommensurate diagonal spiral phase. We argue that in this phase effective dipole coupling to the electric field is important, with the spin-current coupling potentially being the dominant mechanism for spin-1/2. For this setting, we use linear spin wave theory to evaluate the leading nonlinear polarization response which is of second order in the driving field. We show that the response function features a strong antidiagonal, galvanoelectric feature. The width of this feature is set by relaxation rates beyond the noninteracting magnon picture, thereby providing access to single-magnon lifetimes within the multi-magnon continuum of the response function. Moreover, the response function is shown to display various structures in the two-dimensional frequency plane related to exceptional regions of the magnon dispersion.

Title: Fixed Point Stability Switches from Attractive to Repulsive at 2d Pomeranchuk/Stoner Instabilities via Field-Theoretical RG
Authors: Han Ma
Abstract: We study an interacting two-flavor fermionic system via field-theoretical functional renormalization group (RG). Each flavor, labeled by $\pm$, has a dispersion of $E^{\pm}=c k^{2\alpha}-\mu^\pm$ with tunable real exponent $\alpha>0$. The effective theory is parametrized by intra-flavor and inter-flavor interactions, preserving global U(1) $\times$ U(1) symmetry, which can be enhanced to U(2). The U(2) symmetric system has a Fermi liquid phase and two possible instabilities, leading to spontaneous spatial rotational or flavor symmetry breaking, known as the Pomeranchuk and Stoner instabilities, respectively. The key discovery of this work is the following. The Stoner instability possesses an RG fixed point that preserves the U(2) symmetry. For $\alpha<1$, this fixed point is attractive, indicating a continuous transition. Conversely, for $\alpha>1$, the fixed point becomes repulsive, and without fine-tuning, there is runaway RG flow, resulting in a discontinuous transition. The U(1) $\times$ U(1) symmetric system, with $\mu^+\neq \mu^-$, exhibits richer physics. This system have two Pomeranchuk instabilities. At one of them, a non-trivial RG fixed point switches its nature from attractive to repulsive as $\alpha$ increases across $1$. Notably, the runaway flow at $\alpha>1$ results in the depletion of a Fermi surface at the transition. Collective modes in these Fermi liquids are also investigated. A universal Fermi surface deformation ratio $\delta\mu^+/\delta\mu^-$ is predicted for $\alpha<1$ at the instability as a continuous transition, which can be observed experimentally.

Title: Magnetic ground state of a Jeff = 1/2 based frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet
Authors: M. Barik, J. Khatua, Suyoung Kim, Eundeok Mun, Suheon Lee, Bassam Hitti, Gerald D. Morris, Kwang-Yong Choi, P. Khuntia
Abstract: The subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom, crystal electric fields, and spin correlations can lead to exotic quantum states in 4f ion-based frustrated magnets. We present the crystal structure, thermodynamic, and muon spin relaxation studies of the 4f ion-based frustrated magnet Ba4YbReWO12, wherein Yb3+ ions constitute a triangular lattice. The magnetic susceptibility does not show any signature of spin freezing down to 1.9 K or long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.4 K. The low-temperature Curie-Weiss fit to the inverse magnetic susceptibility data reveals a weak antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the Jeff=1/2 state of the Yb3+ moments in the lowest Kramers doublet. The lowest Kramers ground state doublet is well separated from the first excited state with a gap of 278 K, as evidenced by our muon spin relaxation experiments that support the realization of the Jeff 1/2 state at low temperatures. The specific heat indicates a phase transition at 0.09 K, and the associated entropy release at low temperatures is consistent with that expected for the Jeff = 1/2 state. The zero-field muSR measurements show neither the signature of spin freezing nor a phase transition, at least down to 43 mK. Our results suggest the coexistence of static and slowly fluctuating moments in the ground state of this Jeff = 1/2 frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet. Ba4RReWO12 (R=rare earth) offers a viable platform to realize intriguing quantum states borne out of spin-orbit coupling and frustration.

Title: Mott transition in excitonic Bose polarons
Authors: E. A. Szwed, B. Vermilyea, D. J. Choksy, Zhiwen Zhou, M. M. Fogler, L. V. Butov
Abstract: For a neutral system of positive and negative charges, such as atoms in a crystal, increasing the density causes the Mott transition from bound electrons to free electrons. The density of optically generated electron-hole systems can be controlled in situ by the power of optical excitation that enables the Mott transition from excitons, the bound pairs of electrons and holes, to free electrons and holes with increasing density. These Mott transitions occur in systems of pairs of the same kind, such as atoms or excitons. However, a different type of the Mott transition can occur for Bose polarons. A Bose polaron is a mobile particle of one kind in a Bose gas of particles of another kind. For the Mott transition in polarons, the polaron states vanish with increasing density of the surrounding gas. In this paper, we present the observation of this type of the Mott transition and the measurement of the Mott transition parameter $n_{\rm M}^{1/2} a_{\rm B}$ in 2D excitonic Bose polarons.

Title: Crystal fields, exchange, and dipolar interactions and noncollinear magnons of erbium oxide
Authors: Kian Maleki, Michael E. Flatté
Abstract: We simulate the properties of magnons in erbium oxide, a noncollinear antiferromagnet, from an effective single-ion Hamiltonian, including exchange and long-range dipolar interactions. We parametrize the crystal field splitting of Er$_2$O$_3$ using Steven's operators and obtain the effective symmetry-dependent exchange constants between different erbium ions quenched by the crystal field at different symmetry sites. We apply the Holstein-Primakoff transformation to the noncollinear spin system and employ paraunitary diagonalization for the effective spin Hamiltonian. The addition of the dipolar interaction to the exchange magnon dispersion changes the magnon bands drastically. The long-range nature of the dipolar interaction provides challenges to convergence, however we find that the averaged and normalized difference in the magnon dispersion is less than an averaged factor of $10^{-6}$ if the dipolar interaction is included out to the fortieth nearest neighbor.

Title: Tuning Diblock Copolymer Morphology by Adding Associative Homopolymers
Authors: Xiangyu Zhang, Jing Zong, Dong Meng
Abstract: The ability to tune the microstructures formed by block copolymers using accessible physical approaches provides control for practical material applications. A common strategy involves the addition of homopolymers, which can induce morphological changes through their preferential partitioning into specific microdomains. More recently, supramolecular interactions - being chemistry-specific and stimuli-responsive - have emerged as powerful tools for enabling switchable morphologies. To gain microscopic insight into this process, we present a simulation study of diblock copolymers blended with homopolymers that selectively associate with one of the blocks via reversible associations. By varying the mode of association, we examine the structural changes induced by supramolecular complexation and compare them with those arising from Van der Waals (VDW) interactions. Our results reveal that, despite exhibiting similar levels of homopolymer partitioning, the lamellar structures differ significantly between the association-driven system and the VDW driven system. Cluster analysis indicates that only small clusters form at weak association strength, whereas a continuous network emerges under strong association conditions. Dynamic analysis further indicates that both morphology and supramolecular binding kinetics significantly influence the diffusion of homopolymers across microdomains, highlighting the material's potential responsiveness to external stimuli.

Title: The dynamical role of optical phonons and sub-lattice screening in a solid-state ion conductor
Authors: Kim H. Pham, Vijaya Begum-Hudde, Amy K. Lin, Natan A. Spear, Jackson McClellan, Michael W. Zuerch, Andre Schliefe, Kimberly A. See, Scott Cushing
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) require ionic conductivities that are competitive with liquid electrolytes to realize applications in all-solid state batteries. Although numerous materials have been discovered, the underlying mechanisms enabling superionic conduction remain elusive. In particular, the role of ultrafast lattice dynamics in mediating ion migration, which involves couplings between ions, phonons, and electrons, is rarely explored experimentally at their corresponding timescales. To investigate the contributions of coupled lattice dynamics on ion migration, we modulate the charge density occupations within the crystal, and then measure the time-resolved change in impedance on picosecond timescales for a candidate SSE, Li0.5La0.5TiO3. Upon perturbation, we observe enhanced ion migration at ultrafast timescales that are shorter than laser-induced heating. The respective transients match the timescales of optical and acoustic phonon vibrations, suggesting their involvement in ion migration. We further computationally evaluate the effect of a charge transfer from the O 2p to Ti 3d band on the electronic and physical structure of LLTO. We hypothesize that the charge transfer excitation distorts the TiO6 polyhedra by altering the local charge density occupancy of the hopping site at the migration pathway saddle point, thereby causing a reduction in the migration barrier for the Li+ hop, shown using computation. We rule out the contribution of photogenerated electrons and laser heating. Overall, our investigation introduces a new spectroscopic tool to probe fundamental ion hopping mechanisms transiently at ultrafast timescales, which has previously only been achieved in a time-averaged manner or solely via computational methods. Our proposed technique expands our capability to answer dynamical questions previously limited by incumbent spectroscopic strategies.

Title: Magnetic excitations in Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_{n}$O$_{3n+1}$ Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates observed via resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
Authors: Sophia F. R. TenHuisen, Grace A. Pan, Qi Song, Denitsa R. Baykusheva, Dan Ferenc Segedin, Berit H. Goodge, Hanjong Paik, Jonathan Pelliciari, Valentina Bisogni, Yanhong Gu, Stefano Agrestini, Abhishek Nag, Mirian García-Fernández, Ke-Jin Zhou, Lena F. Kourkoutis, Charles M. Brooks, Julia A. Mundy, Mark P. M. Dean, Matteo Mitrano
Abstract: Magnetic interactions are thought to play a key role in the properties of many unconventional superconductors, including cuprates, iron pnictides, and square-planar nickelates. Superconductivity was also recently observed in the bilayer and trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, whose electronic structure is expected to differ from that of cuprates and square-planar nickelates. Here we study how electronic structure and magnetic interactions evolve with the number of layers, $n$, in thin film Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_{n}$O$_{3n+1}$ with $n=1,\:3$, and 5 using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). The RIXS spectra are consistent with a high-spin $|3d^8 \underline{L} \rangle$ electronic configuration, resembling that of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_4$ and the parent perovskite, NdNiO$_3$. The magnetic excitations soften to lower energy in the structurally self-doped, higher-$n$ films. Our observations confirm that structural tuning is an effective route for altering electronic properties, such as magnetic superexchange, in this prominent family of materials.

Title: Flow-driven Stretch Fluctuations Cause Anomalous Rate-Thinning In Elongating Associative Polymers
Authors: Songyue Liu, Thomas C. O'Connor
Abstract: We use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to verify recent tube-model predictions that associative polymer networks exhibit broad stretch fluctuations during elongational flow. Simulations further show that these fluctuating dynamics give rise to the rate-dependent extensional viscosity $\eta_E$ measured in filament stretching experiments on H-bonding networks. Simulations model bivalent associative networks with a reactive bead-spring model for varying association strength and extensional strain rate. We observe that stretch fluctuations are driven by a new form of chain tumbling, where chains continually collapse and elongate as their associations break and reform within the convecting network. This produces a broad, nearly uniform distribution of chain stretch over a wide range of strain rates, manifesting as a rate-independent plateau in the extensional stress. Our results show that the nonlinear viscoelasticity of associative networks is dominated by large fluctuations in molecular response, which cannot be captured by current mean-field models.

Title: Small-Cell-Based Fast Active Learning of Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Zijian Meng, Hao Sun, Edmanuel Torres, Christopher Maxwell, Ryan Eric Grant, Laurent Karim Béland
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are often trained with on-the-fly active learning, where sampled configurations from atomistic simulations are added to the training set. However, this approach is limited by the high computational cost of ab initio calculations for large systems. Recent works have shown that MLIPs trained on small cells (1-8 atoms) rival the accuracy of large-cell models (100s of atoms) at far lower computational cost. Herein, we refer to these as small-cell and large-cell training, respectively. In this work, we iterate on earlier small-cell training approaches and characterize our resultant small-cell protocol. Potassium and sodium-potassium systems were studied: the former, a simpler system benchmarked in detail; the latter, a more complex binary system for further validation. Our small-cell training approach achieves up to two orders of magnitude of cost savings compared to large-cell (54-atom) training, with some training runs requiring fewer than 120 core-hours. Static and thermodynamic properties predicted using the MLIPs were evaluated, with small-cell training in both systems yielding strong ab initio agreement. Small cells appear to encode the necessary information to model complex large-scale phenomena--solid-liquid interfaces, critical exponents, diverse concentrations--even when the training cells themselves are too small to accommodate these phenomena. Based on these tests, we provide analysis and recommendations.

Title: Advanced measurement techniques in quantum Monte Carlo: The permutation matrix representation approach
Authors: Nic Ezzell, Itay Hen
Abstract: In a typical finite temperature quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation, estimators for simple static observables such as specific heat and magnetization are known. With a great deal of system-specific manual labor, one can sometimes also derive more complicated non-local or even dynamic observable estimators. Within the permutation matrix representation (PMR) flavor of QMC, however, we show that one can derive formal estimators for arbitrary static observables. We also derive exact, explicit estimators for general imaginary-time correlation functions and non-trivial integrated susceptibilities thereof. We demonstrate the practical versatility of our method by estimating various non-local, random observables for the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice.

Title: GPR_calculator: An On-the-Fly Surrogate Model to Accelerate Massive Nudged Elastic Band Calculations
Authors: Isaac Onyango, Byungkyun Kang, Qiang Zhu
Abstract: We present GPR_calculator, a package based on Python and C++ programming languages to build an on-the-fly surrogate model using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to approximate expensive electronic structure calculations. The key idea is to dynamically train a GPR model during the simulation that can accurately predict energies and forces with uncertainty quantification. When the uncertainty is high, the expensive electronic structure calculation is performed to obtain the ground truth data, which is then used to update the GPR model. To illustrate the power of GPR_calculator, we demonstrate its application in Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) simulations of surface diffusion and reactions, achieving 3-10 times acceleration compared to pure ab initio calculations.

Title: Capturing the Demon in Szilard's Engine
Authors: Xiangjun Xing (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China)
Abstract: In Szilard's engine, a demon measures a one-particle gas and applies feedback to extract work from thermal fluctuations, embodying Maxwell's notion that information reduces thermodynamic entropy - an apparent second-law violation. The Landauer-Bennett Thesis resolves this paradox by requiring the demon to record the measurement, which results in an entropy increase in the demon's memory. Eventually, the demon's memory needs to be erased. The erasure costs the same work as extracted previously, hence there is no violation of the second law. Though widely accepted, the fictitious memory invoked in the thesis has drawn multiple criticisms, with debates persisting over the demon's necessity. We show that the demon is the piston that partitions the space and drives the expansion. The final position of the piston after expansion records the particle's position pre-expansion: it is an ``information-bearing degree of freedom''. In this Piston-Demon Thesis, memory register and feedback (expansion) happen simultaneously. Our exposition identifies the mischievous demon as a physical degree of freedom, and greatly simplifies Szilard's engine. It also offers educators a tangible illustration of information-thermodynamics.

Title: Exact lattice summations for Lennard-Jones potentials coupled to a three-body Axilrod-Teller-Muto term applied to cuboidal phase transitions
Authors: Andres Robles-Navarro, Shaun Cooper, Andreas A. Buchheit, Jonathan Busse, Antony Burrows, Odile Smits, Peter Schwerdtfeger
Abstract: This work provides a rigorous analysis of Bain-type cuboidal lattice transformations, which connect the face-centered cubic (fcc), mean-centered cubic (mcc), body-centered cubic (bcc) and axially centered cubic (acc) lattices. Our study incorporates a general $(n,m)$ Lennard-Jones two-body potential and a long-range repulsive Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM) three-body potential. The two-body lattice sums and their meromorphic continuations are evaluated to full precision using super-exponentially convergent series expansions. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach to computing three-body lattice sums by converting the multi-dimensional sum into an integral involving products of Epstein zeta functions. This enables us to evaluate three-body lattice sums and their meromorphic continuations to machine precision within minutes on a standard laptop. Using our computational framework, we analyze the stability of cuboidal lattice phases relative to the close-packed fcc structure along a Bain transformation path for varying ATM coupling strengths. We analytically demonstrate that the ATM cohesive energy exhibits an extremum at the bcc phase and show numerically that it corresponds to a minimum for repulsive three-body forces along the Bain path. Our results indicate that strong repulsive three-body interactions can destabilize the fcc phase and render bcc energetically favorable for soft LJ potentials. However, even in this scenario, the bcc phase remains susceptible to further cuboidal distortions. These results suggest that the stability of the bcc phase is, besides vibrational, temperature, and pressure effects, strongly influenced by higher than two-body forces. Because of the wrong short-range behavior of the triple-dipole ATM model the LJ potential is limited to exponents $n>9$ for the repulsive wall, otherwise one observes distortion into a set of linear chains collapsing to the origin.

Title: Cryogenic-temperature Grain-to-grain Epitaxial Growth of High-quality Ultrathin CoFe Layer on MgO Tunnel Barrier for High-performance Magnetic Tunnel Junctions
Authors: Tomohiro Ichinose, Tatsuya Yamamoto, Takayuki Nozaki, Kay Yakushiji, Shingo Tamaru, Shinji Yuasa
Abstract: One candidate for ultimate non-volatile memory with ultralow power consumption is magneto-resistive random-access memory (VC-MRAM). To develop VC-MRAM, it is important to fabricate high-performance magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), which require the epitaxial growth of an ultrathin ferromagnetic electrode on a crystalline tunnel barrier using a mass-manufacturing-compatible process. In this study, the grain-to-grain epitaxial growth of perpendicularly magnetized CoFe ultrathin films on polycrystalline MgO (001) was demonstrated using cryogenic-temperature sputtering on 300 mm Si wafers. Cryogenic-temperature sputtering at 100 K suppressed the island-like initial growth of CoFe on MgO without hampering epitaxy. Sub-nanometer-thick CoFe layers exhibited remarkable perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). An even larger PMA was obtained using an Fe-doped MgO (MgFeO) tunnel barrier owing to improved uniformity of the CoFe layer. A 0.8-nm-thick CoFe layer grown on MgFeO exhibited a magnetic damping constant as low as 0.008. The ultralow magnetic damping enables voltage-driven magnetization switching with a low write-error rate (WER) below 10^-6 at a pulse duration of 0.3 ns, and WER on the order of 10^-3 even for a relatively long pulse duration of 1.5 ns. These properties achieved using a mass-manufacturing deposition process can promote the development of VC-MRAM and other advanced spintronic devices based on MTJs.

Title: Orientational ordering in active nematic solids
Authors: Haiqian Yang, Ming Guo, L. Mahadevan
Abstract: In vivo and in vitro systems of cells and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) systems are well known to form ordered patterns of orientationally aligned fibers. Here, we interpret them as active analogs of the (disordered) isotropic to the (ordered) nematic phase transition seen in passive liquid crystalline elastomers. A minimal theoretical framework that couples cellular activity (embodied as mechanical stress) and the finite deformation elasticity of liquid crystal elastomers sets the stage to explain these patterns. Linear stability analysis of the governing equations about simple homogeneous isotropic base states shows how the onset of periodic morphologies depends on the activity, elasticity, and applied strain, provides an expression for the wavelength of the instability, and is qualitatively consistent with observations of cell-ECM experiments. Finite element simulations of the nonlinear problem corroborate the results of linear analysis. These results provide quantitative insights into the onset and evolution of nematic order in cell-matrix composites.

Title: Ultrahigh room-temperature hole conductivity in a perovskite cuprate with vanishing electron-correlation

Abstract: Electron-correlated two-dimensional (2D) cuprates have been extensively studied since the discovery of high-Tc superconductivity, in contrast, the three-dimensional (3D) counterpart perovskite cuprates remain largely unexplored due to their chemical instability and synthesis challenges. Herein, we develop an efficient two-step approach that combines symmetry-selective growth and topotactic oxidization to synthesize high-quality perovskite LaCuO3 films, and furthermore reveal its exotic electronic states. The compressively strained LaCuO3 films exhibit an unexpected ultrahigh p-type conductivity of ~1.5*10^5 S/cm with a hole mobility of ~30 cm2 V-1 s-1 at room-temperature. X-ray absorption spectra and first-principles calculations unveil a ligand-hole state of p-d hybridization with degenerate eg orbitals and light effective mass, indicating nearly-vanishing electron-correlation. These features contrast sharply with 2D cuprates and offer physical insights into the design of high-performance electronic devices.

Title: Structure-Property Relationship in Disordered Hyperuniform Materials: Microstructure Representation, Field Fluctuations and Effective Properties
Authors: Liyu Zhong, Sheng Mao, Yang Jiao
Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform (DHU) materials are an emerging class of exotic heterogeneous material systems characterized by a unique combination of disordered local structures and a hidden long-range order, which endow them with unusual physical properties. Here, we consider material systems possessing continuously varying local material properties $\mathcal{K}({\bf x})$ modeled via a random field. We devise quantitative microstructure representation of the material systems based on a class of analytical spectral density function ${\tilde \chi}_{_\mathcal{K}}({k})$ associated with $\mathcal{K}({\bf x})$, possessing a power-law small-$k$ scaling behavior ${\tilde \chi}_{_\mathcal{K}}({k}) \sim k^\alpha$. By controlling the exponent $\alpha$ and using a highly efficient forward generative model, we obtain realizations of a wide spectrum of distinct material microstructures spanning from hyperuniform ($\alpha>0$) to nonhyperuniform ($\alpha=0$) to antihyperuniform ($\alpha<0$) systems. We perform a comprehensive perturbation analysis to quantitatively connect the fluctuations of the local material property to the fluctuations of the resulting physical fields. In the weak-contrast limit, our first-order perturbation theory reveals that the physical fields associated with Class-I hyperuniform materials (characterized by $\alpha \ge 2$) are also hyperuniform, albeit with a lower hyperuniformity exponent ($\alpha-2$). As one moves away from this weak-contrast limit, the fluctuations of the physical field develop a diverging spectral density at the origin. We also establish an end-to-end mapping connecting the spectral density of the local material property to the overall effective conductivity of the material system via numerical homogenization.

Title: Evaluation of Circular Complex Permeability in Single-Crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet at Cryogenic Temperatures
Authors: Junta Igarashi, Shota Norimoto, Hiroyuki Kayano, Noriyoshi Hashimoto, Makoto Minohara, Nobu-Hisa Kaneko, Tomonori Arakawa
Abstract: The operation of superconducting qubits requires a sensitive readout circuit at cryogenic temperatures, driving the demand for cryogenic non-reciprocal microwave components such as circulators. However, evaluating these components at low temperatures presents significant challenges for companies and institutions without specialized measurement systems. In the development of such cryogenic non-reciprocal components, the temperature dependence of ferrite's magnetic properties is the most critical factor. Therefore, an evaluation technique for accurately assessing these properties at cryogenic temperatures is essential. In this study, we develop a measurement method to characterize low-loss ferrite materials over a temperature range of 300 K to 2 K. The use of the circularly polarized resonance mode (TE11n) enables the direct estimation of circular complex permeability and the determination of key material parameters, including saturation magnetization and damping constant - both essential for assessing the performance of ferrite materials in circulator applications. Without the need for device fabrication, we demonstrate that single-crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) can effectively function as a circulator down to 2 K. This approach offers a promising pathway for the development of cryogenic circulators.

Title: Quantifying the Phase Diagram and Hamiltonian of $S=1/2$ Kagome Antiferromagnets: Bridging Theory and Experiment
Authors: Shengtao Jiang, Arthur C. Campello, Wei He, Jiajia Wen, Daniel M. Pajerowski, Young S. Lee, Hong-Chen Jiang
Abstract: Spin-$1/2$ kagome antiferromagnets are leading candidates for realizing quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground states. While QSL ground states are predicted for the pure Heisenberg model, understanding the robustness of the QSL to additional interactions that may be present in real materials is a forefront question in the field. Here we employ large-scale density-matrix renormalization group simulations to investigate the effects of next-nearest neighbor exchange couplings $J_2$ and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions $D$, which are relevant to understanding the prototypical kagome materials herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite. By utilizing clusters as large as XC12 and extrapolating the results to the thermodynamic limit, we precisely delineate the scope of the QSL phase, which remains robust across an expanded parameter range of $J_2$ and $D$. Direct comparison of the simulated static and dynamic spin structure factors with inelastic neutron scattering reveals the parameter space of the Hamiltonians for herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite, and, importantly, provides compelling evidence that both materials exist within the QSL phase. These results establish a powerful convergence of theory and experiment in this most elusive state of matter.

Title: Optoelectronic properties of self-trapped holes in orthorhombic Ga2O3 and its alloys
Authors: Eric Welch, Lauro Guerra, Luisa Scolfaro, Luiz A. F. C. Viana, Pablo D. Borges
Abstract: We investigated the influence of valence band holes on the optoelectronic properties of orthorhombic k-Ga2O3 and its alloys with Al and In. Our hybrid density functional theory calculations show that self-trapped holes (STHs) localize on oxygen atoms within a single unit cell and exhibit \emph{p}-orbital characteristics. The inclusion of isoelectronic dopants such as Al and In reduces but does not remove the absorption of visible light due to STH formation. The combination of a positive STH formation energy, large lattice distortions, and emergent acceptor levels, coupled with the observed red-shifted, visible spectrum, emergent absorption peaks, implies that alternative doping/alloying strategies are necessary to achieve effective p-type conductivity in orthorhombic k-Ga2O3.

Authors: Yubin Zhang, Anthony Seret, Jette Oddershede, Azat Slyamov, Jan Kehres, Florian Bachmann, Carsten Gundlach, Ulrik Lund Olsen, Jacob Bowen, Henning Friis Poulsen, Erik Lauridsen, Dorte Juul Jensen
Abstract: The development of three-dimensional (3D) non-destructive X-ray characterization techniques in home laboratories is essential for enabling many more researchers to perform 3D characterization daily, overcoming the limitations imposed by competitive and scarce access to synchrotron facilities. Recent efforts have focused on techniques such as laboratory diffraction contrast tomography (LabDCT), which allows 3D characterization of recrystallized grains with sizes larger than 15-20 $\mu$m, offering a boundary resolution of approximately 5$\mu$m using commercial X-ray computed tomography (CT) systems. To enhance the capabilities of laboratory instruments, we have developed a new laboratory-based 3D X-ray micro-beam diffraction (Lab-3D$\mu$XRD) technique. Lab-3D$\mu$XRD combines the use of a focused polychromatic beam with a scanning-tomographic data acquisition routine to enable depth-resolved crystallographic orientation characterization. This work presents the first realization of Lab-3D$\mu$XRD, including hardware development through the integration of a newly developed Pt-coated twin paraboloidal capillary X-ray focusing optics into a conventional X-ray $\mu$CT system, as well as the development of data acquisition and processing software. The results are validated through comparisons with LabDCT and synchrotron phase contrast tomography. The findings clearly demonstrate the feasibility of Lab-3D$\mu$XRD, particularly in detecting smaller grains and providing intragranular information. Finally, we discuss future directions for developing Lab-3D$\mu$XRD into a versatile tool for studying materials with smaller grain sizes and high defect densities, including the potential of combining it with LabDCT and $\mu$CT for multiscale and multimodal microstructural characterization.

Title: Homogeneous nucleation rate of carbon dioxide hydrate formation under experimental condition from Seeding simulations
Authors: I. M. Zerón, J. Algaba, J. M. Míguez, J. Grabowska, S. Blazquez, E. Sanz, C. Vega, F. J. Blas
Abstract: We investigate the nucleation of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) hydrates from carbon dioxide aqueous solutions by means of molecular dynamics simulations using the TIP4P/Ice and the TraPPE models for water and CO$_2$ respectively. We work at 400 bar and different temperatures and CO$_2$ concentrations. We use brute force molecular dynamics when the supersaturation or the supercooling are so high so that nucleation occurs spontaneously and Seeding otherwise. We used both methods for a particular state and we get a rate of 10$^{25}\,\text{m}^{-3}\text{s}^{-1}$ for nucleation in a CO$_2$ saturated solution at 255 K (35 K of supercooling). By comparison with our previous work on methane hydrates, we conclude that nucleation of CO$_2$ hydrates is several orders of magnitude faster due to a lower interfacial free energy between the crystal and the solution. By combining our nucleation studies with a recent calculation of the hydrate-solution interfacial free energy at coexistence, we obtain a prediction of the nucleation rate temperature dependence for CO$_{2}$-saturated solutions (the experimentally relevant concentration). On the one hand, we open the window for comparison with experiments for supercooling larger than 25 K. On the other hand, we conclude that homogeneous nucleation is impossible for supercooling lower than 20 K. Therefore, nucleation must be heterogeneous in typical experiments where hydrate formation is observed at low supercooling. To assess the hypothesis that nucleation occurs at the solution-CO$_2$ interface we run spontaneous nucleation simulations in two-phase systems and find, by comparison with single-phase simulations, that the interface does not affect hydrate nucleation, at least at the deep supercooling at which this study was carried out (40 and 45 K). Overall, our work sheds light on molecular and thermodynamic aspects of hydrate nucleation.

Title: Coexistence of topologically trivial and non-trivial Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bands in magnetic atomic chains on a superconductor
Authors: Bendegúz Nyári, Philip Beck, András Lászlóffy, Lucas Schneider, Krisztián Palotás, László Szunyogh, Roland Wiesendanger, Jens Wiebe, Balázs Újfalussy, Levente Rózsa
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have been proposed as a promising basis for Majorana qubits offering great potential for topological quantum computation. Such modes may form at the ends of a magnetic atomic chain on a superconductor. Typically only a single MZM may be present at one end of the chain, but symmetry may protect multiple MZMs at the same end. Here, we study the topological properties of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bands of excitations in Mn chains constructed on a Nb(110) and on a Ta(110) substrate using first-principles calculations and scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy experiments. We demonstrate that even and odd YSR states with respect to mirroring on the symmetry plane containing the chain have different dispersions, and both of them may give rise to MZMs separately. Although the spin-orbit coupling leads to a hybridization between the bands, multiple MZMs may still exist due to the mirror symmetry. These findings highlight the influence of symmetries on interpreting the spectroscopic signatures of candidates for MZMs.

Title: Wigner distribution, Wigner entropy, and Anomalous Transport of a Generalized Aubry-André model
Authors: Feng Lu, Hailin Tan, Ao Zhou, Shujie Cheng, Gao Xianlong
Abstract: In this paper, we study a generalized Aubry-André model with tunable quasidisordered potentials. The model has an invariable mobility edge that separates the extended states from the localized states. At the mobility edge, the wave function presents critical characteristics, which can be verified by finite-size scaling analysis. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the extended, critical, and localized states can be effectively distinguished via their phase space representation, specially the Wigner distribution. Based on the Wigner distribution function, we can further obtain the corresponding Wigner entropy and employ the feature that the critical state has the maximum Wigner entropy to locate the invariable mobility edge. Finally, we reveal that there are anomalous transport phenomena between the transition from ballistic transport to the absence of diffusion.

Title: Atomic structure analysis of PL5 in silicon carbide with single-spin spectroscopy
Authors: Yu Chen, Qi Zhang, Mingzhe Liu, Jinpeng Liu, Jingyang Zhou, Pei Yu, Shaochun Lin, Yuanhong Teng, Wancheng Yu, Ya Wang, Changkui Duan, Fazhan Shi, Jiangfeng Du
Abstract: Divacancy (VV) spin defects in 4H polytype of silicon carbide (4H-SiC) are emerging candidates for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Among these defects, PL5 and PL6 stand out due to their superior charge stability and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) properties at room temperature. However, their atomic structures remain unresolved, with ongoing controversy regarding their potential association with stacking faults. Previous measurements relying on spin ensemble detection are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In this study, we conduct correlative imaging of stacking faults and PL5-6 at single-defect level, conclusively demonstrating that PL5-6 are not associated with stacking faults. Further investigation of PL5 through single-spin ODMR spectroscopy allows us to determine its six spatial orientations, as well as to measure the orientation of its transverse anisotropy spin splitting (E) and the statistical distribution of hyperfine splitting. These results and ab initio calculations suggest that PL5 should be VsiVc(hk) divacancy coupled with a nearby antisite atom (VVA). The structure resolution of PL5 starts the first step toward its controllable fabrication, paving the way for various applications.

Title: Tuning chirality amplitude at ultrafast timescales
Authors: Hiroki Ueda, Takahiro Sato, Quynh L. Nguyen, Elizabeth Skoropata, Ludmila Leroy, Tim Suter, Elsa Abreu, Matteo Savoini, Vincent Esposito, Matthias Hoffmann, Carl P. Romao, Julien Zaccaro, Diling Zhu, Steven Lee Johnson, Urs Staub
Abstract: Chirality is a fundamental symmetry concept describing discrete states, i.e., left-handed, right-handed, or achiral, and existing at disparate scales and in many categories of scientific fields. Even though symmetry breaking is indispensable for describing qualitatively distinct phenomena, symmetry cannot quantitatively predict measurable quantities. One can continuously distort an object, introducing the concept of chirality amplitude, similar to representing magnetization as the amplitude of time-reversal symmetry breaking. Considering the role of magnetization in emergent phenomena with time-reversal symmetry breaking, chirality amplitude is intuitively a key quantity for controlling chirality-related emergent phenomena. Here, we propose two types of chiral lattice distortions and demonstrate the tunability of their amplitude in ultrafast timescales. Resonant X-ray diffraction with circular polarization is an established technique to measure crystal chirality directly. We quantify the ultrafast change in chirality amplitude in real time after an optical excitation. Using instead a THz excitation, we observe oscillations in the resonant diffraction intensities corresponding to specific phonon frequencies. This indicates the creation of additional asymmetry, which could also be described as an enhancement in chirality amplitude. Our proposed concept of chirality amplitude and its ultrafast control may lead to a unique approach to control chirality-induced emergent phenomena in ultrafast timescales.

Title: Enhanced THz emission from spintronic emitters with Pt-Al alloys
Authors: Felix Janus, Nicolas Beermann, Jyoti Yadav, Reshma Rajeev Lekha, Wentao Zhang, Hassan A. Hafez, Dmitry Turchinovich, Markus Meinert
Abstract: Platinum (Pt) is the element with the largest spin Hall conductivity and is known as the most efficient spin-to-charge conversion material in spintronic THz emitters. By alloying with aluminum (Al), its resistivity can be substantially increased, exceeding $100\,\mu\Omega$cm. While the spin Hall conductivity is reduced by alloying, the relative resistivity increase surpasses the reduction of spin Hall conductivity and thereby enhances the spin Hall angle. We make use of this mechanism to improve the commonly used Pt-based spintronic THz emitter and demonstrate that an increase of 67% in the THz emission amplitude can be achieved between 20\% and 30\% Al in Pt. We show that the enhanced THz emission amplitude is driven by the enhanced multilayer impedance due to the larger resistivity.

Title: Quasi-rigid-band behavior and band gap changes upon isovalent substitution in Cs$_3$Bi$_2$Br$_{9-x}$I$_x$
Authors: Sergei M. Butorin
Abstract: The recently introduced approach, combining the parameter-free Armiento-Kümmel generalized gradient approximation exchange functional with the nonseparable gradient approximation Minnesota correlation functional, was used to calculate the electronic structure of the Cs$_3$Bi$_2$Br$_{9-x}$I$_x$ series within density functional theory including the spin-orbit coupling. The changes in the band gap size and its dependence on the $x$ value was investigated. The band gap was found to be of indirect nature and it decreases with increasing I content as long as the system is in the $P\overline{3}m1$ phase. A clear non-linear dependence of the band gap size on $x$ was established which is in qualitative and quantitative agreement with reported experimental data. The quasi-rigid band behavior of the states in the valence and conduction bands of the $P\overline{3}m1$ phase is discussed since no significant changes in the shape of the total density of unoccupied states were observed upon the isovalent substitution.

Title: Nonperturbative quantum theory of multiplasmonic electron emission from surfaces: Gauge-specific cumulant expansions vs. Volkov ansatz over plasmonic coherent states
Authors: Branko Gumhalter
Abstract: Energetic electromagnetic fields produce a variety of elementary excitations in solids that can strongly modify their primary photoemission spectra. Such is the plasmon excitation or pumping mechanism which, although indirect, is very efficient and hence may give rise to formation of plasmonic coherent states. In turn, these states may act as a source or sink of energy and momentum for escaping electrons. Starting from the model Hamiltonian approach we show that prepumped plasmonic bath of coherent states gives rise to ponderomotive potentials and Floquet electronic band structure that support multiple plasmon-induced electron emission or plasmoemission from metals. Theoretical description of multiple plasmoemission requires a nonperturbative approch which is here formulated by applying cumulant expansion and Volkov ansatz to the calculations of electron wavefunctions and emission rates. The calculations are performed in the standard length gauge as well as in the Pauli-transformed velocity gauge for electron-plasmon interaction. The applicability of two nonperturbative approaches to calculation of excitation amplitudes are examined in each gauge. They smoothly interpolate between the fully quantal first order Born approximation and semiclassical multiplasmon-induced electron excitation limit. This is illustrated on the example of plasmoemission from Floquet surface bands on Ag(111) from which this channel of electron yield has been detected. Our calculations indicate that even subsingle mode occupations of plasmonic coherent states can support multiplasmon electron emission from surface bands. A way of calibration of plasmonic coherent states is proposed.

Title: Chirality-induced selectivity of angular momentum by orbital Edelstein effect in carbon nanotubes
Authors: Börge Göbel, Ingrid Mertig, Samir Lounis
Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising materials exhibiting exceptional strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal properties, making them promising for various technologies. Besides achiral configurations with a zigzag or armchair edge, there exist chiral CNTs with a broken inversion symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that chiral CNTs exhibit chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS), which is caused by the orbital Edelstein effect and could be detected as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that the orbital Edelstein susceptibility is an odd function of the chirality angle of the nanotube and is proportional to its radius. For metallic CNTs close to the Fermi level, the orbital Edelstein susceptibility increases quadratically with energy. This makes the CISS and CIOS of metallic chiral nanotubes conveniently tunable by doping or applying a gate voltage, which allows for the generation of spin- and orbital-polarized currents. The possibility of generating large torques makes chiral CNTs interesting candidates for technological applications in spin-orbitronics and quantum computing.

Title: Role of activity and dissipation in achieving precise beating in cilia: Insights from the rower model
Authors: Subhajit Gupta, Debasish Chaudhuri, Supravat Dey
Abstract: Cilia and flagella are micron-sized filaments that actively beat with remarkable precision in a viscous medium, driving microorganism movement and efficient flow. We study the rower model to uncover how cilia activity and dissipation enable this precise motion. In this model, cilia motion is represented by a micro-beads Brownian movement between two distant harmonic potentials. At specific locations, energy pumps trigger potential switches, capturing cilia activity and generating oscillations. We quantify precision of oscillation using a quality factor, identifying its scaling with activity and oscillation amplitude, finding precision maximization at an optimal amplitude. The data collapse is not accurate for noisy oscillations. An exact analytic expression for the precision quality factor, based on first passage time fluctuations, and derived in the small noise approximation, explains its optimality and scaling. Energy budget analysis shows the quality factor's consistency with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation.

Title: Hallmarks of terahertz magnon currents in an antiferromagnetic insulator
Authors: Hongsong Qiu, Oliver Franke, Yuanzhe Tian, Zdeněk Kašpar, Reza Rouzegar, Oliver Gueckstock, Ji Wu, Maguang Zhu, Biaobing Jin, Yongbing Xu, Tom S. Seifert, Di Wu, Piet W. Brouwer, Tobias Kampfrath
Abstract: The efficient transport of spin angular momentum is expected to play a crucial role in future spintronic devices, which potentially operate at frequencies reaching the terahertz range. Antiferromagnetic insulators exhibit significant potential for facilitating ultrafast pure spin currents by terahertz magnons. Consequently, we here use femtosecond laser pulses to trigger ultrafast spin currents across antiferromagnetic NiO thin films in Py|NiO|Pt stacks, where permalloy (Py) and Pt serve as spin-current source and detector respectively. We find that the spin current pulses traversing NiO reach a velocity up to 40 nm/ps and experience increasing delay and broadening as the NiO thickness is increased. We can consistently explain our observations by ballistic transport of incoherent magnon. Our approach has high potential to characterize terahertz magnon transport in magnetic insulators with any kind of magnetic order.

Title: Effects of Berry Curvature and Orbital Magnetic Moment in the Magnetothermoelectric Transport of Bloch Electron Systems
Authors: Viktor Könye, Masao Ogata
Abstract: Thermoelectric transport coefficients up to linear order in the applied magnetic field are microscopically studied using Kubo-Luttinger linear response theory and thermal Green's functions. We derive exact formulas for the thermoelectric conductivity and thermal conductivity in the limit of small relaxation rates for Bloch electrons in terms of Bloch wave functions, which show that the Sommerfeld-Bethe relationship holds. Our final formula contains the Berry curvature contributions as well as the orbital magnetic moment contributions, that arise naturally from the microscopic theory. We show that generalized $f$-sum rules containing the Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment play essential roles in taking into account the interband effects of the magnetic field. As an application, we study a model of a gapped Dirac electron system with broken time-reversal symmetry and show the presence of a linear magnetothermopower in such systems.

Title: Magnetic polarons at finite temperature: One-hole spectroscopy study
Authors: Toni Guthardt, Markus Scheb, Jan von Delft, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated fermions described by Hubbard or $t$-$J$ models in the underdoped regime -- relevant for high-temperature superconductivity in cuprate compounds -- remains a subject of ongoing debate. In particular, the nature of charge carriers in this regime is poorly understood, in part due to the unusual properties of their spectral function. In this Letter, we present unbiased numerical results for the one-hole spectral function in a $t$-$J$ model at finite temperatures. Our study provides valuable insights into the underlying physics of magnetic (or spin-) polaron formation in a doped antiferromagnet (AFM). For example, we find how the suppression of spectral weight outside the magnetic Brillouin zone -- a precursor of Fermi arc formation -- disappears with increasing temperature, revealing nearly-deconfined spinon excitations of the undoped AFM. The pristine setting we consider can be directly explored using quantum simulators. Our calculations demonstrate that coherent quasiparticle peaks associated with magnetic polarons can be observed up to temperatures $T>J$ above the spin-exchange $J$, routinely obtained in such experiments. This paves the way for future studies of the fate of magnetic polarons in the pseudogap phase.

Title: Finite-temperature real-time properties of magnetic polarons in two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets
Authors: Toni Guthardt, Markus Scheb, Jan von Delft, Fabian Grusdt, Annabelle Bohrdt
Abstract: Due to significant progress in quantum gas microscopy in recent years, there is a rapidly growing interest in real-space properties of single mobile dopands created in correlated antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulators. However, a detailed numerical description remains challenging, even for simple toy models. As a consequence, previous numerical simulations for large systems were largely limited to $T=0$. To provide guidance for cold-atom experiments, numerical calculations at finite temperature are required. Here, we numerically study the real-time properties of a single mobile hole in the 2D $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature and draw a comparison to features observed at $T=0$. We find that a three-stage process of hole motion, which was reported at $T=0$, is valid even at finite temperature. However, already at low temperatures, the average hole velocity at long times is not simply proportional to the spin coupling, contrary to the $T=0$ behavior. Comparing our finite-temperature numerical results with the experimental data from quantum gas microscopy we find a qualitative disagreement: in experiment, hole spreading speeds up with increasing $J/t$, while in our numerics it slows down. The latter is consistent with the numerical findings previously reported at $T=0$.

Title: Statistics of power and efficiency for collisional Brownian engines
Authors: Gustavo A. L. Forão, Fernando S. Filho, Pedro V. Paraguassú
Abstract: Collisional Brownian engines have attracted significant attention due to their simplicity, experimental accessibility, and amenability to exact analytical solutions. While previous research has predominantly focused on optimizing mean values of power and efficiency, the joint statistical properties of these performance metrics remain largely unexplored. Using stochastic thermodynamics, we investigate the joint probability distributions of power and efficiency for collisional Brownian engines, revealing how thermodynamic fluctuations influence the probability of observing values exceeding their respective mean maxima. Our conditional probability analysis demonstrates that when power fluctuates above its maximum mean value, the probability of achieving high efficiency increases substantially, suggesting fluctuation regimes where the classical power-efficiency trade-off can be probabilistically overcome. Notably, our framework extends to a broader class of engines, as the essential features of the statistics of the system are fully determined by the Onsager coefficients. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of fluctuations in Brownian engines, highlighting how stochastic behavior can enable performance beyond traditional thermodynamic bounds.

Title: Antiferromagnetic Chiral Bobber Formation and Topological Proximity Effect in MnBi2Te4
Authors: Y. Xu, D. Kurebayashi, D. Zhang, P. Schoenherr, L. Li, Z. Yue, W. J. Ren, M.-G. Han, Y. Zhu, Z. Cheng, X. Wang, Oleg A. Tretiakov, J. Seidel
Abstract: With topological materials being billed as the key to a new generation of nanoelectronics via either functional real-space topological structures (domain walls, skyrmions etc.) or via momentum-space topology (topological insulators), tailored and controllable topological properties are of paramount significance, since they lead to topologically protected states with negligible dissipation, enabling stable and non-volatile information processing. Here, we report on the evolution of topological magnetic textures in the proximity of other topological defects, i.e., antiferromagnetic domain walls in the topological insulator MnBi2Te4. The transition from the antiferromagnetic ground state to a canted antiferromagnetic state at finite magnetic fields is accompanied by the formation of chiral bobbers - bulk-terminated topological defects adjacent to the domain walls in this system, leading to a topological proximity effect.

Title: Monitored quantum transport: full counting statistics of a quantum Hall interferometer
Authors: C.W.J. Beenakker, Jin-Fu Chen
Abstract: We generalize the Levitov-Lesovik formula for the probability distribution function of the electron charge transferred through a phase coherent conductor, to include projective measurements that monitor the chiral propagation in quantum Hall edge modes. When applied to an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the monitoring reduces the visibility of the Aharonov-Bohm conductance oscillations while preserving the binomial form of the counting statistics, thereby removing a fundamental shortcoming of the dephasing-probe model of decoherence.

Title: Active Matter Flocking via Predictive Alignment
Authors: Julian Giraldo-Barreto, Viktor Holubec
Abstract: Understanding collective self-organization in active matter, such as bird flocks and fish schools, remains a grand challenge in physics. Alignment interactions are essential for flocking, yet alone, they are generally considered insufficient to maintain cohesion against noise, forcing traditional models to rely on artificial boundaries or added attractive forces. Here, we report the first model to achieve cohesive flocking using purely alignment interactions, introducing predictive alignment: agents orient based on the predicted future headings of their neighbors. Implemented in a discrete-time Vicsek-type framework, this approach delivers robust, noise-resistant cohesion without additional parameters. In the stable regime, flock size scales linearly with interaction radius, remaining nearly immune to noise or propulsion speed, and the group coherently follows a leader under noise. These findings reveal how predictive strategies enhance self-organization, paving the way for a new class of active matter models blending physics and cognitive-like dynamics.

Title: Interference-caged quantum many-body scars: the Fock space topological localization and interference zeros
Authors: Tao-Lin Tan, Yi-Ping Huang
Abstract: We propose a general mechanism for realizing athermal finite-energy-density eigenstates -- termed interference-caged quantum many-body scars (ICQMBS) -- which originate from exact many-body destructive interference on the Fock space graph. These eigenstates are strictly localized to specific subsets of vertices, analogous to compact localized states in flat-band systems. Central to our framework is a connection between interference zeros and graph automorphisms, which classify vertices according to the graph's local topology. This connection enables the construction of a new class of topological ICQMBS, whose robustness arises from the local topology of the Fock space graph rather than from conventional conservation laws or dynamical constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by developing a graph-theory-based search algorithm, which identifies ICQMBS in both a one-dimensional spin-1 XY model and two-dimensional quantum link models across distinct gauge sectors. In particular, we discover the proposed topological ICQMBS in the two-dimensional quantum link model and provide an intuitive explanation for previously observed order-by-disorder phenomena in Hilbert space. Our results reveal an unexpected synergy between graph theory, flat-band physics, and quantum many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the structure and stability of nonthermal eigenstates.

Title: Atomic Regional Superfluids in two-dimensional Moiré Time Crystals
Authors: Weijie Liang, Weiping Zhang, Keye Zhang
Abstract: Moiré physics has transcended spatial dimensions, extending into synthetic domains and enabling novel quantum phenomena. We propose a theoretical model for a two-dimensional (2D) Moiré time crystal formed by ultracold atoms, induced by periodic perturbations applied to a non-lattice trap. Our analysis reveals the emergence of regional superfluid states exhibiting moiré-scale quantum coherence across temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal domains. This work provides fundamental insights into temporal moiré phenomena and presents an alternative pathway to engineer spatial moiré phases without requiring twisted multilayer lattices.

Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we examine the electronic structure of quasi-one-dimensional fullerene nanoribbons derived from two-dimensional fullerene networks. Depending on the edge geometry and width, these nanoribbons exhibit a rich variety of properties, including direct and indirect band gaps, positive and negative effective masses, as well as dispersive and flat bands. Our findings establish a comprehensive understanding of the electronic properties of fullerene nanoribbons, with potential implications for the design of future nanoscale devices.

Title: Mechanical Amorphization of Glass-Forming Systems Induced by Oscillatory Deformation: The Energy Absorption and Efficiency Control
Authors: Baoshuang Shang, Xinxin Li, Pengfei Guan, Weihua Wang
Abstract: The kinetic process of mechanical amorphization plays a central role in tailoring material properties. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of how this process depends on loading parameters is critical for optimizing mechanical amorphization and tuning material performance. In this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate oscillatory deformation-induced amorphization in three glass-forming intermetallic systems, addressing two unresolved challenges: (1) the relationship between amorphization efficiency and mechanical loading, and (2) energy absorption dynamics during crystal-to-amorphous (CTA) transitions. Our results demonstrate a decoupling between amorphization efficiency--governed by work rate and described by an effective temperature model--and energy absorption, which adheres to the Herschel-Bulkley constitutive relation. Crucially, the melting enthalpy emerges as a key determinant of the energy barrier, establishing a thermodynamic analogy between mechanical amorphization and thermally induced melting. This relationship provides a universally applicable metric to quantify amorphization kinetics. By unifying material properties and loading conditions, this work establishes a predictive framework for controlling amorphization processes. These findings advance the fundamental understanding of deformation-driven phase transitions and offer practical guidelines for designing materials with tailored properties for ultrafast fabrication, ball milling, and advanced mechanical processing techniques.

Title: Inverse Design of Block Polymer Materials with Desired Nanoscale Structure and Macroscale Properties
Authors: Vinson Liao, Arthi Jayaraman
Abstract: The rational design of novel polymers with tailored material properties has been a long-standing challenge in the field due to the large number of possible polymer design variables. To accelerate this design process, there is a critical need to develop novel tools to aid in the inverse design process and efficiently explore the high-dimensional polymer design space. Optimizing macroscale material properties for polymeric systems is difficult as properties are dictated by features on a multitude of length scales, ranging from the chosen monomer chemistries to the chain level design to larger-scale domain structures. In this work, we present an efficient high-throughput in-silico based framework to effectively design high-performance polymers with desired multi-scale nanostructure and macroscale properties, which we call RAPSIDY 2.0 - Rapid Analysis of Polymer Structure and Inverse Design strategY 2.0. This new version of RAPSIDY builds upon our previous work, RAPSIDY 1.0, which focused purely on identifying polymer designs that stabilized a desired nanoscale morphology. In RAPSIDY 2.0 we use a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and Bayesian optimization driven active learning to optimally query high-dimensional polymer design spaces and propose promising design candidates that simultaneously stabilize a selected nanoscale morphology and exhibit desired macroscale material properties. We utilize MD simulations with polymer chains preplaced into selected nanoscale morphologies and perform virtual experiments to determine the stability of the chosen polymer design within the target morphology and calculate the desired macroscale material properties (e.g., thermal conductivity). Our methodology directly addresses the unique challenge associated with copolymers, whose macroscale properties are a function of both their chain design and mesoscale morphology, which are coupled.

Title: Short-range magnetic order and planar anisotropy in the topological ferrimagnet Mn3Si2Te6
Authors: Raju Baral, Andrew F. May, Stuart Calder
Abstract: Mn3Si2Te6 is a ferrimagnetic topological nodal-line semiconductor that exhibits unconventional colossal magnetoresitance (CMR) behavior, with short-range spin fluctuations being potentially intimately linked to the emergent properties. In this work, we determine the short range magnetic order and quantify the local magnetic anisotropy through total neutron scattering and polarized neutron powder diffraction (pNPD) measurements on polycrystalline Mn3Si2Te6. The real space local and long range spin structure was determined through the application of magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis, with measurements from the low temperature ordered phase to the high temperature paramagnetic state. Short-range order over a frustrated trimer of three nearest neighbors was found to exist well above the long range ferrimagnetic transition. pNPD measurements in the spin polarized paramagnetic state were used to extract the local site susceptibility tensor of the Mn ions to quantify the magnetic anisotropy. Our combined mPDF and pNPD results provide quantitative information on the short-range order intrinsic to Mn3Si2Te6, showing strong in-plane anisotropy with the spins largely confined to the ab-plane in zero field and remain stable with increasing temperature through the long-range to short-range ordered transition.

Title: Phonon fluctuation diagnostics: Origin of charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals
Authors: Stefan Enzner, Jan Berges, Arne Schobert, Dongjin Oh, Mingu Kang, Riccardo Comin, Ronny Thomale, Tim O. Wehling, Domenico Di Sante, Giorgio Sangiovanni
Abstract: The microsopic origin of the charge-density wave (CDW) in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) kagome metals remains a longstanding question, often revolving around electron-phonon coupling and purely electronic mechanisms involving Van Hove scenarios, nesting, and sublattice interference. To reveal the processes driving the CDW transition, we combine ab-initio calculations analysis of the phonon self-energy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Our momentum-resolved study, supported by ARPES data, reveals that lattice instabilities in the V-135 family of kagome metals appear to also be driven by electronic states far from high-symmetry points, where these states exhibit the strongest coupling with the phonon modes responsible for the CDW distortion. Footing on an interpretation scheme based on phonon fluctuation diagnostics, our work challenges and revises theories that so far have exclusively attributed CDW formation to nesting effects close to the Fermi level.

Title: Dislocation Patterning as a Mechanism for Flat Band Formation
Authors: Aziz Fall, Kaushik Dayal
Abstract: We compute the second-order correction to the electronic dispersion relation of a free electron gas interacting with an effective electron-dislocation potential, derived from a modern quantized theory of dislocations. Our results demonstrate that dislocation patterning induces anisotropic flat bands in the electronic dispersion under specific strain fields and directions, referred to as ``magic'' parameters. These flat bands acquire non-zero curvature as the strain or direction deviates from these magic parameters.

Title: Spectral delineation of Markov Generators: Classical vs Quantum
Authors: Dariusz Chruściński, Sergey Denisov, Wojciech Tarnowski, Karol Życzkowski
Abstract: The celebrated theorem of Perron and Frobenius implies that spectra of classical Markov operators, represented by stochastic matrices, are restricted to the unit disk. This property holds also for spectra of quantum stochastic maps (quantum channels), which describe quantum Markovian evolution in discrete time. Moreover, the spectra of stochastic $N \times N$ matrices are additionally restricted to a subset of the unit disk, called Karpeleviuc region, the shape of which depends on $N$. We address the question of whether the spectra of generators, which induce Markovian evolution in continuous time, can be bound in a similar way. We propose a rescaling that allows us to answer this question affirmatively. The eigenvalues of the rescaled classical generators are confined to the modified Karpeleviuc regions, whereas the eigenvalues of the rescaled quantum generators fill the entire unit disk.

Title: Hydrodynamic Coulomb drag in odd electron liquids
Authors: Dmitry Zverevich, Dmitri B. Gutman, Alex Levchenko
Abstract: We consider the problem of Coulomb drag resistance in bilayers of electron liquids with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. In the hydrodynamic regime, the viscosity tensor of such fluids has a nonvanishing odd component. In this scenario, fluctuating viscous stresses drive the propagation of plasmons, whose dispersion relations are modified by nondissipative odd viscous waves. Coulomb coupling of electron density fluctuations induces a drag force exerted by one layer on the other in the presence of a steady flow. This drag force can be expressed through the dynamic structure factor of the electron liquid, which is peaked at frequencies corresponding to plasmon resonances in the bilayer. As a result, the drag resistivity depends on the dissipationless odd viscosity of the fluid. We quantify this effect and present a general theory of hydrodynamic fluctuations applicable to odd electron liquids, both with and without Galilean invariance.

Title: A Novel Graphyne-Like Carbon Allotrope: 2D Dewar-Anthracyne
Authors: José A. S. Laranjeira, Kleuton A. L. Lima, Nicolas F. Martins, Luiz A. Ribeiro Junior, Douglas S. Galvao, Julio R. Sambrano
Abstract: Anthracyne (2DDA). 2DDA consists of chains of Dewar-anthracenes connected by acetylenic linkages. DFT-based simulations show that 2DDA is thermally stable and exhibits no imaginary phonon modes, confirming its dynamic stability. 2DDA is metallic with Dirac-like features near the Fermi level, dominated by C pz orbitals. It shows marked mechanical anisotropy, with Young's modulus of 176.24 N/m (x) and 31.51 N/m (y), shear modulus up to 69.14 N/m, and Poisson's ratio varying from 0.27 to 0.87. The material also exhibits strong anisotropic optical absorption in the visible and ultraviolet ranges. Raman and IR spectra reveal intense bands at 648 cm-1 (Raman) and 1292 cm-1 (Infrared). Nanoribbon structures derived from 2DDA exhibit diverse electronic behaviors, from metals up to bandgap values of up to 0.42 eV, depending on the edge-type terminations and width. These findings demonstrate the 2DDA potential for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications.

Title: Localization and Topology in Noncentrosymmetric Superconductors with Disorder
Authors: Jinkun Wang, Sigma-Jun Lu, Mei Xiang, Wu-Ming Liu
Abstract: The celebrated Kitaev chain reveals a captivating phase diagram in the presence of various disorders, encompassing multifractal states and topological Anderson phases. In this work, we investigate the localization and topological properties of a dimerized topological noncentrosymmetric superconductor (NCS) under quasiperiodic and Anderson disorders. Using both global and local characterization methods, we identify energy-dependent transitions from ergodic to multifractal and localized states. Extended multifractal regimes emerge from the competition between dimerization, NCS order, and quasiperiodic modulation. This interplay causes localization to occur preferentially in different energy bands depending on the disorder strength, with the lowest bands exhibiting the highest sensitivity to parameter variations. We employ the real-space polarization method to compute the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant, revealing alternating topological and trivial phases as the quasiperiodic potential increases, a behavior distinct from the typical topological Anderson phase diagram. Additionally, the topological states show remarkable robustness against Anderson disorder, providing new insights into topological phase stability in non-centrosymmetric systems. Finally, we propose a feasible experimental scheme based on superconducting Josephson junctions, where NCS-like behavior can be engineered via spatially modulated supercurrents. Our findings highlight the distinct roles of different disorder types in shaping localization and topology, providing insight into the engineering of Majorana zero modes and offering profound implications for topological quantum encryption schemes.

Title: Fractional Chern Insulator and Quantum Anomalous Hall Crystal in Twisted MoTe$_2$
Authors: Jialin Chen, Qiaoyi Li, Xiaoyu Wang, Wei Li
Abstract: Recent experimental advances have uncovered fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) systems, posing significant theoretical challenges in understanding the interaction effects and correlated topological phases. Here, we construct a realistic moiré lattice model tailored for tMoTe$_2$ and conduct investigations using state-of-the-art tensor-network methods. Our ground-state calculations reveal a rich array of interaction- and filling-dependent phases, including the FCI, Chern insulator, and generalized Wigner crystal, etc., explaining recent experimental observations. Moreover, we reveal quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibiting integer Hall conductivity at fractional moiré unit cell fillings, which opens new avenues for experimental exploration in tMoTe$_2$. In the FCI phase, dynamical simulations reveal a single-particle continuum with a finite charge gap, indicating the presence of fractional charge excitations. Moreover, our finite-temperature calculations determine the characteristic temperatures for charge activation and ferromagnetic (FM) transitions, consistent with experiments. We find that the charge gap is significantly larger than the energy scales of both thermal activation and FM transitions, explaining recent experimental observations. Overall, by integrating ground-state, finite-temperature, and dynamical tensor-network calculations on the real-space model, we establish a theoretical framework for understanding and exploring correlated topological phases in tMoTe$_2$ and related systems.

Title: Stacking-induced ferroelectricity in tetralayer graphene
Authors: Amit Singh, Shuigang Xu, Patrick Johansen Sarsfield, Pablo Diaz Nunez, Ziwei Wang, Sergey Slizovskiy, Nicholas Kay, Jun Yin, Yashar Mayamei, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Qian Yang, Kostya S. Novoselov, Vladimir I. Falko, Artem Mishchenko
Abstract: Recent studies have reported emergent ferroelectric behavior in twisted or moiré-engineered graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures, yet the microscopic origin of this effect remains under debate. Pristine mono- or few-layer graphene lacks a permanent dipole due to its centrosymmetric lattice, making the emergence of ferroelectricity unlikely. However, mixed-stacked graphene, such as the ABCB tetralayer configuration, breaks both inversion and mirror symmetry and has been theoretically predicted to support electrically switchable dipoles. ABCB graphene represents the simplest natural graphene polytype exhibiting intrinsic out-of-plane polarization, arising from asymmetric charge carrier distribution across its layers. Here, we report robust ferroelectric behavior in dual-gated, non-aligned ABCB tetralayer graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. The device exhibits pronounced hysteresis in resistance under both top and bottom gate modulation, with the effect persisting up to room temperature. This hysteresis originates from reversible layer-polarized charge reordering, driven by gate-induced transitions between ABCB and BCBA stacking configurations -- without requiring moiré superlattices. Our findings establish stacking-order-induced symmetry breaking as a fundamental route to electronic ferroelectricity in graphene and open pathways for non-volatile memory applications based on naturally occurring mixed-stacked multilayer graphene.

Title: Periodic Motzkin chain: Ground states and symmetries
Authors: Andrei G. Pronko
Abstract: Motzkin chain is a model of nearest-neighbor interacting quantum $s=1$ spins with open boundary conditions. It is known that it has a unique ground state which can be viewed as a sum of Motzkin paths. We consider the case of periodic boundary conditions and provide several conjectures about structure of the ground state space and symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We conjecture that the ground state is degenerate and independent states distinguished by eigenvalues of the third component of total spin operator. Each of these states can be described as a sum of paths, similar to the Motzkin paths. Moreover, there exist two operators commuting with the Hamiltonian, which play the roles of lowering and raising operators when acting at these states. We conjecture also that these operators generate the Lie algebra of $C$-type of the rank equal to the number of sites. The symmetry algebra of the Hamiltonian is actually wider, and extended, besides the cyclic shift operator, by a central element contained in the third component of total spin operator.

Title: High-Performance Gradient Evaluation for Complex Soft Materials Using MPI-based DFS Algorithm
Authors: Anurag Bhattacharyya
Abstract: This article presents a depth-first search (DFS)-based algorithm for evaluating sensitivity gradients in the topology optimization of soft materials exhibiting complex deformation behavior. The algorithm is formulated using a time-dependent adjoint sensitivity approach and is implemented within a PETSc-based C++ MPI framework for efficient parallel computing. It has been found that on a single processor, the sensitivity analysis for these complex materials can take approximately 45 minutes. This necessitates the use of high-performance computing (HPC) to achieve feasible optimization times. This work provides insights into the algorithmic framework and its application to large-scale generative design for physics integrated simulation of soft materials under complex loading conditions.

Title: Functionally graded keratin facilitates tactile sensing in elephant whiskers
Authors: Andrew K. Schulz, Lena V. Kaufmann, Lawrence T. Smith, Deepti S. Philip, Hilda David, Jelena Lazovic, Michael Brecht, Gunther Richter, Katherine J. Kuchenbecker
Abstract: Keratin composites enable animals to hike with hooves, fly with feathers, and sense with skin. These distinct functions arise from variations in the underlying properties and microscale arrangement of this natural polymer. One well-studied example is mammalian whiskers, elongated keratin rods attached to tactile skin structures that extend the animal's sensory volume. Here, we investigate the non-actuated whiskers that cover Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) trunks and find they are geometrically and mechanically tailored to facilitate tactile perception by encoding contact location in vibrotactile signal amplitude and frequency. Elephant whiskers emerge from armored trunk skin and shift from a thick, circular, porous, stiff root to a thin, ovular, dense, soft point. This smooth transition enables interaction with widely varying substrates, reduces wear, and increases the vibrotactile signal information generated during contact. The functionally graded geometry, porosity, and stiffness of elephant whiskers tune the neuromechanics of trunk touch, facilitating highly dexterous manipulation.

Title: Efficient mutual magic and magic capacity with matrix product states
Authors: Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Tobias Haug
Abstract: Stabilizer Rényi entropies (SREs) probe the non-stabilizerness (or magic) of many-body systems and quantum computers. Here, we introduce the mutual von-Neumann SRE and magic capacity, which can be efficiently computed in time $O(N\chi^3)$ for matrix product states (MPSs) of bond dimension $\chi$. We find that mutual SRE characterizes the critical point of ground states of the transverse-field Ising model, independently of the chosen local basis. Then, we relate the magic capacity to the anti-flatness of the Pauli spectrum, which quantifies the complexity of computing SREs. The magic capacity characterizes transitions in the ground state of the Heisenberg and Ising model, randomness of Clifford+T circuits, and distinguishes typical and atypical states. Finally, we make progress on numerical techniques: we design two improved Monte-Carlo algorithms to compute the mutual $2$-SRE, overcoming limitations of previous approaches based on local update. We also give improved statevector simulation methods for Bell sampling and SREs with $O(8^{N/2})$ time and $O(2^N)$ memory, which we demonstrate for $24$ qubits. Our work uncovers improved approaches to study the complexity of quantum many-body systems.

Title: Noise-Aware Entanglement Generation Protocols for Superconducting Qubits with Impedance-Matched FBAR Transducers
Authors: Erin Sheridan, Michael Senatore, Samuel Schwab, Eric Aspling, Taylor Wagner, James Schneeloch, Stephen McCoy, Daniel Campbell, David Hucul, Zachary Smith, Matthew LaHaye
Abstract: Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\;\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $>90\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.

Title: Low-voltage Ferroelectric Field-Effect Transistors with Ultrathin Aluminum Scandium Nitride and 2D channels
Authors: Chloe Leblanc, Hyunmin Cho, Yinuo Zhang, Seunguk Song, Zachary Anderson, Yunfei He, Chen Chen, Joan Redwing, Roy H. Olsson III, Deep Jariwala
Abstract: The continued evolution of CMOS technology demands materials and architectures that emphasize low power consumption, particularly for computations involving large scale data processing and multivariable optimization. Ferroelectric materials offer promising solutions through enabling dual-purpose memory units capable of performing both storage and logic operations. In this study, we demonstrate ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs) with MoS2 monolayer channels fabricated on ultrathin 5 nm and 10 nm ferroelectric Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) films. By decreasing the thickness of the ferroelectric film, we achieve significantly reduced gate voltages (<3V) required to switch the conductance of the devices, enabling operation at low voltages compatible with advanced CMOS. We observe a characteristic crossover in hysteresis behavior that varies with film thickness, channel fabrication method, and environmental conditions. Through systematic investigation of multiple parameters including channel fabrication methods, dimensional scaling, and environmental effects, we provide pathways to improve device performance. While our devices demonstrate clear ferroelectric switching behavior, further optimization is required to enhance the ON/OFF ratio at zero gate voltage while continuing to reduce the coercive field of these ultrathin films.

Title: Bistability and charge-density blowup in the onset of drop Quincke rotation
Authors: Gunnar G. Peng, Ory Schnitzer
Abstract: Particles in a sufficiently strong electric field spontaneously rotate, provided that charge relaxation is slower in the particle than in the suspending fluid. It has long been known that drops also exhibit such "Quincke rotation," with the electrohydrodynamic flow induced by electrical shear stresses at the interface leading to an increased critical field. However, the hysteretic onset of this instability, observed for sufficiently low-viscosity drops, has so far eluded theoretical understanding -- including simulations that have struggled in this regime owing to charge-density-steepening effects driven by surface convection. Here, we conduct a numerical study of the leaky-dielectric model in a simplified two-dimensional setting involving a circular drop, considering arbitrary viscosity ratios and field strengths. As the viscosity of the drop is decreased relative to the suspending fluid, the pitchfork bifurcation marking the onset of drop rotation is found to transition from supercritical to subcritical, giving rise to a field-strength interval of bistability. In this subcritical regime, the critical field is always large enough that, at the bifurcation, the symmetric base-state solution exhibits equatorial charge-density blowup singularities of the type recently described by Peng et al. (Phys. Rev. Fluids, 9 083701, 2024). As the rotation speed increases along the initially unstable solution branch from the bifurcation, the singularities gradually shift from the equator and ultimately disperse once the rotational component of the flow is strong enough to eliminate the surface stagnation points.

Title: Data Fusion of Deep Learned Molecular Embeddings for Property Prediction
Authors: Robert J Appleton, Brian C Barnes, Alejandro Strachan
Abstract: Data-driven approaches such as deep learning can result in predictive models for material properties with exceptional accuracy and efficiency. However, in many problems data is sparse, severely limiting their accuracy and applicability. To improve predictions, techniques such as transfer learning and multi-task learning have been used. The performance of multi-task learning models depends on the strength of the underlying correlations between tasks and the completeness of the dataset. We find that standard multi-task models tend to underperform when trained on sparse datasets with weakly correlated properties. To address this gap, we use data fusion techniques to combine the learned molecular embeddings of various single-task models and trained a multi-task model on this combined embedding. We apply this technique to a widely used benchmark dataset of quantum chemistry data for small molecules as well as a newly compiled sparse dataset of experimental data collected from literature and our own quantum chemistry and thermochemical calculations. The results show that the fused, multi-task models outperform standard multi-task models for sparse datasets and can provide enhanced prediction on data-limited properties compared to single-task models.

Title: Learning to erase quantum states: thermodynamic implications of quantum learning theory
Authors: Haimeng Zhao, Yuzhen Zhang, John Preskill
Abstract: The energy cost of erasing quantum states depends on our knowledge of the states. We show that learning algorithms can acquire such knowledge to erase many copies of an unknown state at the optimal energy cost. This is proved by showing that learning can be made fully reversible and has no fundamental energy cost itself. With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning. Together, our results establish a concrete connection between quantum learning theory and thermodynamics, highlighting the physical significance of learning processes and enabling efficient learning-based protocols for thermodynamic tasks.

Title: Catalight -- an open source automated photocatalytic reactor package illustrated through plasmonic acetylene hydrogenation
Authors: B. B. Bourgeois, A. X. Dai, C. C. Carlin, L. Yuan, A. Al-Zubeidi, W-H. Cheng, D. F. Swearer, J. A. Dionne
Abstract: An open-source and modular Python package, Catalight, is developed and demonstrated to automate (photo)catalysis measurements. (Photo)catalysis experiments require studying several parameters to evaluate performance, including temperature, gas flow rate and composition, illumination power, and spectral profile. Catalight orchestrates measurements over this complicated parameter space and systematically stores, analyzes, and visualizes the resulting data. To showcase the capabilities of Catalight, we perform an automated apparent activation barrier measurement of acetylene hydrogenation over a plasmonic AuPd catalyst on Al2O3 support, simultaneously varying laser power, wavelength, and temperature in a multi-day experiment controlled by a simple Python script. Our chemical results unexpectedly show an increased activation barrier upon light excitation, contrary to previous findings for other plasmonic reactions and catalysts. We show that the reaction rate order with respect to both acetylene and hydrogen is unchanged upon illumination, suggesting that molecular surface coverage is not changing under light excitation. By analyzing the inhomogeneity of the laser induced heating, we attribute these results to a partial photothermal effect combined with a photochemical/hot electron driven mechanism. Our findings highlight the capabilities of a new experiment automation tool; explore the photocatalytic mechanism for an industrially relevant reaction; and identify systematic sources of error in canon photocatalysis experimental procedures.

Title: Dynamical quantum phase transition, metastable state, and dimensionality reduction: Krylov analysis of fully-connected spin models
Authors: Kazutaka Takahashi
Abstract: We study quenched dynamics of fully-connected spin models. The system is prepared in a ground state of the initial Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian is suddenly changed to a different form. We apply the Krylov subspace method to map the system onto an effective tridiagonal Hamiltonian. The state is confined in a potential well and is time-evolved by nonuniform hoppings. The dynamical singularities for the survival probability can occur when the state is reflected from a potential barrier. Although we do not observe any singularity in the spread complexity, we find that the entropy exhibits small dips at the singular times. We find that the presence of metastable state affects long-time behavior of the spread complexity, and physical observables. We also observe a reduction of the state-space dimension when the Hamiltonian reduces to a classical form.

Title: Lifetime-limited Gigahertz-frequency Mechanical Oscillators with Millisecond Coherence Times
Authors: Yizhi Luo, Hilel Hagai Diamandi, Hanshi Li, Runjiang Bi, David Mason, Taekwan Yoon, Xinghan Guo, Hanlin Tang, Ryan O. Behunin, Frederick J. Walker, Charles Ahn, Peter T. Rakich
Abstract: High-frequency mechanical oscillators with long coherence times are essential to realizing a variety of high-fidelity quantum sensors, transducers, and memories. However, the unprecedented coherence times needed for quantum applications require exquisitely sensitive new techniques to probe the material origins of phonon decoherence and new strategies to mitigate decoherence in mechanical oscillators. Here, we combine non-invasive laser spectroscopy techniques with materials analysis to identify key sources of phonon decoherence in crystalline media. Using micro-fabricated high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonators ($\mu$HBARs) as an experimental testbed, we identify phonon-surface interactions as the dominant source of phonon decoherence in crystalline quartz; lattice distortion, subsurface damage, and high concentration of elemental impurities near the crystal surface are identified as the likely causes. Removal of this compromised surface layer using an optimized polishing process is seen to greatly enhance coherence times, enabling $\mu$HBARs with Q-factors of > 240 million at 12 GHz frequencies, corresponding to > 6 ms phonon coherence times and record-level f-Q products. Complementary phonon linewidth and time-domain ringdown measurements, performed using a new Brillouin-based pump-probe spectroscopy technique, reveal negligible dephasing within these oscillators. Building on these results, we identify a path to > 100 ms coherence times as the basis for high-frequency quantum memories. These findings clearly demonstrate that, with enhanced control over surfaces, dissipation and noise can be significantly reduced in a wide range of quantum systems.

Title: Ground State Energy of Helium Using a Four-Qubit Photonic Processor with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
Authors: Badie Ghavami, Forouzan Mirmasoudi
Abstract: To understand the properties and interactions of materials, and determining the ground state energies is one of the important challenges in quantum chemistry, materials science, and quantum mechanics, where quantum computing can play an important role for studying the properties of materials. In this study, we have explored the quantum processor application to compute the Helium (He) molecule ground state energy which utilizes the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In here, we have implemented VQE on a state-of-the-art quantum processor, optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit to minimize the energy expectation value of the He molecule's Hamiltonian on the four qubits processor. The obtained results of this work show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to classical computational methods, such as Hartree-Fock and density functional theory, which demonstrate the compute potential of quantum algorithms in quantum many-body problems. Thus, these results demonstrate the advantages of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy in simulations of molecular and material properties, and pave the way for future applications in more complex systems. This work highlights the potential of quantum processors in the fields of quantum chemistry, computational physics, and data science.

Title: Operator growth in many-body systems of higher spins
Authors: Igor Ermakov
Abstract: We study operator growth in many-body systems with on-site spins larger than $1/2$, considering both non-integrable and integrable regimes. Specifically, we compute Lanczos coefficients in the one- and two-dimensional Ising models for spin values $S=1/2$, $1$, and $3/2$, and observe asymptotically linear growth $b_n \sim n$. On the integrable side, we investigate the Potts model and find square-root growth $b_n \sim \sqrt{n}$. Both results are consistent with the predictions of the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. To analyze operator dynamics in this setting, we employ a generalized operator basis constructed from tensor products of shift and clock operators, extending the concept of Pauli strings to higher local dimensions. We further report that the recently introduced formalism of equivalence classes of Pauli strings can be naturally extended to this setting. This formalism enables the study of simulable Heisenberg dynamics by identifying dynamically isolated operator subspaces of moderate dimensionality. As an example, we introduce the Kitaev-Potts model with spin-$1$, where the identification of such a subspace allows for exact time evolution at a computational cost lower than that of exact diagonalization.

Title: Quantum error correction via multi-particle discrete-time quantum walk
Authors: Ryo Asaka, Ryusei Minamikawa
Abstract: We propose a scheme of quantum error correction that employs a multi-particle quantum walk defined on nested squares, each hosting a single particle. In this model, each particle moves within its own distinct square through iterations of three discrete-time steps. First, a particle updates its two-level internal {\it coin} state. Next, it either moves to an adjacent vertex or stays put, depending on the outcome. Finally, it interacts with another particle if these particles arrive at the nearest-neighbor vertices of the two adjacent squares, acquiring a phase factor of $-1$. Because a single particle represents a three-qubit state through its position and coin state, Shor's nine-qubit code is implemented using only three particles, with two additional particles for syndrome measurement. Furthermore, by exploiting gauge symmetry, our scheme achieves redundant encoding, error correction, and arbitrary operations on the encoded information using only nearest-neighbor interactions.

Title: Localized quasiparticles in a fluxonium with quasi-two-dimensional amorphous kinetic inductors

Abstract: Disordered superconducting materials with high kinetic inductance are an important resource to generate nonlinearity in quantum circuits and create high-impedance environments. In thin films fabricated from these materials, the combination of disorder and the low effective dimensionality leads to increased order parameter fluctuations and enhanced kinetic inductance values. Among the challenges of harnessing these compounds in coherent devices are their proximity to the superconductor-insulator phase transition, the presence of broken Cooper pairs, and the two-level systems located in the disordered structure. In this work, we fabricate tungsten silicide wires from quasi-two-dimensional films with one spatial dimension smaller than the superconducting coherence length and embed them into microwave resonators and fluxonium qubits, where the kinetic inductance provides the inductive part of the circuits. We study the dependence of loss on the frequency, disorder, and geometry of the device, and find that the loss increases with the level of disorder and is dominated by the localized quasiparticles trapped in the spatial variations of the superconducting gap.

Title: Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity: a Bayesian mean-field framework for epidemic inference
Authors: Alfredo Braunstein, Giovanni Catania, Luca Dall'Asta, Matteo Mariani, Fabio Mazza, Mattia Tarabolo
Abstract: We present the Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity (SCDC) method, a novel generalized mean-field approximation for epidemic inference and risk assessment within a fully Bayesian framework. SCDC accounts for non-causal effects of observations and uses a graphical model representation of epidemic processes to derive self-consistent equations for edge probability marginals. A small-coupling expansion yields time-dependent cavity messages capturing individual infection probabilities and observational conditioning. With linear computational cost per iteration in the epidemic duration, SCDC is particularly efficient and valid even for recurrent epidemic processes, where standard methods are exponentially complex. Tested on synthetic networks, it matches Belief Propagation in accuracy and outperforms individual-based mean-field methods. Notably, despite being derived as a small-infectiousness expansion, SCDC maintains good accuracy even for relatively large infection probabilities. While convergence issues may arise on graphs with long-range correlations, SCDC reliably estimates risk. Future extensions include non-Markovian models and higher-order terms in the dynamic cavity framework.

Title: Three-component Bose-Einstein condensates and wetting without walls
Authors: Joseph O. Indekeu, Nguyen Van Thu, Jonas Berx
Abstract: In previous work within Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) theory for ultracold gases wetting phase transitions were predicted for a phase-segregated two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) adsorbed at an optical wall. The wetting phase diagram was found to depend on intrinsic atomic parameters, being the masses and the scattering lengths, and on the extrinsic wall boundary condition. Here we study wetting transitions in GP theory without an optical wall in a setting with three phase-segregated BEC components instead of two. The boundary condition is removed by replacing the wall with the third component and treating the three phases on an equal footing. This leads to an unequivocal wetting phase diagram that depends only on intrinsic atomic parameters. It features first-order and critical wetting transitions, and prewetting phenomena. The phase boundaries are computed by numerical solution of the GP equations. In addition, useful analytic results are obtained by extending the established double-parabola approximation to three components.

Title: Transformer Wave Function for two dimensional frustrated magnets: emergence of a Spin-Liquid Phase in the Shastry-Sutherland Model
Authors: Luciano Loris Viteritti, Riccardo Rende, Alberto Parola, Sebastian Goldt, Federico Becca
Abstract: Understanding quantum magnetism in two-dimensional systems represents a lively branch in modern condensed-matter physics. In the presence of competing super-exchange couplings, magnetic order is frustrated and can be suppressed down to zero temperature. Still, capturing the correct nature of the exact ground state is a highly complicated task, since energy gaps in the spectrum may be very small and states with different physical properties may have competing energies. Here, we introduce a variational Ansatz for two-dimensional frustrated magnets by leveraging the power of representation learning. The key idea is to use a particular deep neural network with real-valued parameters, a so-called Transformer, to map physical spin configurations into a high-dimensional feature space. Within this abstract space, the determination of the ground-state properties is simplified and requires only a shallow output layer with complex-valued parameters. We illustrate the efficacy of this variational Ansatz by studying the ground-state phase diagram of the Shastry-Sutherland model, which captures the low-temperature behavior of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ with its intriguing properties. With highly accurate numerical simulations, we provide strong evidence for the stabilization of a spin-liquid between the plaquette and antiferromagnetic phases. In addition, a direct calculation of the triplet excitation at the $\Gamma$ point provides compelling evidence for a gapless spin liquid. Our findings underscore the potential of Neural-Network Quantum States as a valuable tool for probing uncharted phases of matter, and open up new possibilities for establishing the properties of many-body systems.

Title: Nonuniversal Equation of State of a Quasi-2D Bose Gas in Dimensional Crossover
Authors: Xiaoran Ye, Tao Yu, Zhaoxin Liang
Abstract: Equation of state (EOS) for a pure two-dimensional (2D) Bose gas exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the s-wave scattering length [L. Salasnich, Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 130402 (2017)]. The pronounced disparity between the EOS of a 2D Bose gas and its 3D counterpart underscores the significance of exploring the dimensional crossover between these two distinct dimensions. In this work, we are motivated to deduce nonuniversal corrections to EOS for an optically trapped Bose gas along the dimensional crossover from 3D to 2D, incorporating the finite-range effects of the interatomic potential. Employing the framework of effective field theory, we derive the analytical expressions for both the ground state energy and quantum depletion. The introduction of the lattice induces a transition from a 3D to a quasi-2D regime. In particular, we systematically analyze the asymptotic behaviors of both the 2D and 3D aspects of the model system, with a specific focus on the nonuniversal effects on the EOS arising from finite-range interactions. The nonuniversal effects proposed in this study along the dimensional crossover represent a significant stride toward unraveling the intricate interplay between dimensionality and quantum fluctuations.

Title: Universal distributions of overlaps from generic dynamics in quantum many-body systems
Authors: Alexios Christopoulos, Amos Chan, Andrea De Luca
Abstract: We study the distribution of overlaps with the computational basis of a quantum state generated under generic quantum many-body chaotic dynamics, without conserved quantities, for a finite time $t$. We argue that, scaling time logarithmically with the system size $t \propto \log L$, the overlap distribution converges to a universal form in the thermodynamic limit, forming a one-parameter family that generalizes the celebrated Porter-Thomas distribution. The form of the overlap distribution only depends on the spatial dimensionality and, remarkably, on the boundary conditions. This picture is justified in general by a mapping to Ginibre ensemble of random matrices and corroborated by the exact solution of a random quantum circuit. Our results derive from an analysis of arbitrary overlap moments, enabling the reconstruction of the distribution. Our predictions also apply to Floquet circuits, i.e., in the presence of mild quenched disorder. Finally, numerical simulations of two distinct random circuits show excellent agreement, thereby demonstrating universality.

Title: Self-correcting GKP qubit and gates in a driven-dissipative circuit
Authors: Frederik Nathan, Liam O'Brien, Kyungjoo Noh, Matthew H. Matheny, Arne L. Grimsmo, Liang Jiang, Gil Refael
Abstract: We show that a self-correcting GKP qubit can be realized with a high-impedance LC circuit coupled to a resistor and a Josephson junction via a controllable switch. When activating the switch in a particular stepwise pattern, the resonator relaxes into a subspace of GKP states that encode a protected qubit. Under continued operation, the resistor dissipatively error-corrects the qubit against bit flips and decoherence by absorbing noise-induced entropy. We show that this leads to an exponential enhancement of coherence time (T1 and T2), even in the presence of extrinsic noise, imperfect control, and device parameter variations. We show the qubit supports exponentially robust single-qubit Clifford gates, implemented via appropriate control of the switch, and readout/initialization via supercurrent measurement. The qubit's self-correcting properties allows it to operate at ~1K temperatures and resonator Q factors down to ~1000 for realistic parameters, and make it amenable to parallel control through global control signals. We discuss how the effects of quasiparticle poisoning -- potentially, though not necessarily, a limiting factor -- might be mitigated. We finally demonstrate that a related device supports a self-correcting magic T gate.

Title: Local structural distortions drive magnetic molecular field in compositionally complex spinel oxide
Authors: Rukma Nevgi, Subha Dey, Nandana Bhattacharya, Soheil Ershadrad, Tinku Dan, Sujay Chakravarty, S. D. Kaushik, Christoph Klewe, George E. Sterbinsky, Biplab Sanyal, Srimanta Middey
Abstract: Understanding how local distortions determine the functional properties of high entropy materials, containing five or more elements at a crystallographic site, is an open challenge. We address this for a compositionally complex spinel oxide (Mn$_{0.2}$Co$_{0.2}$Ni$_{0.2}$Cu$_{0.2}$Zn$_{0.2}$)Cr$_2$O$_4$ ($A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$). By comparatively examining extended X-ray absorption fine structure on $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$ and its parent counterparts $A$Cr$_2$O$_4$ along with density functional theory calculations for multiple configurations, we find that the element-specific distortions go beyond the first neighbor. Specifically, the strong Jahn-Teller distortion present in CuCr$_2$O$_4$ is found to be completely suppressed in $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$. Instead, there is a broad distribution of Cu-O and Cu-Cr bond distances while other $A$-O distances acquire certain specific values. This study demonstrates the additional flexibility of a cationic sublattice in maintaining a uniform long-range structure, in contrast to previous reports showing only the accommodative anionic sublattice. Remarkably, despite the presence of multiple magnetic ions and variable bond lengths, the mean field magnetic interactions of $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$ exhibit a striking resemblance to those of NiCr$_2$O$_4$. This compelling observation originates from the comparability of bond lengths around Cr in both materials. Our study paves the way for a deeper understanding of the impact of local structural distortions in compositionally complex quantum materials, enabling the targeted design with tailored properties.

Title: Translation symmetry restoration under random unitary dynamics
Authors: Katja Klobas, Colin Rylands, Bruno Bertini
Abstract: The finite parts of a large, locally interacting many-body system prepared out-of-equilibrium eventually equilibrate. Characterising the underlying mechanisms of this process and its timescales, however, is particularly hard as it requires to decouple universal features from observable-specific ones. Recently, new insight came by studying how certain symmetries of the dynamics that are broken by the initial state are restored at the level of the reduced state of a given subsystem. This provides a high level, observable-independent probe. Until now this idea has been applied to the restoration of internal symmetries, e.g. U(1) symmetries related to charge conservation. Here we show that that the same logic can be applied to the restoration of space-time symmetries, and hence can be used to characterise the relaxation of fully generic systems. We illustrate this idea by considering the paradigmatic example of "generic" many-body dynamics, i.e. a local random unitary circuit, where our method leads to exact results. We show that the restoration of translation symmetry in these systems only happens on time-scales proportional to the subsystem's volume. In fact, for large enough subsystems the time of symmetry restoration becomes initial-state independent (as long as the latter breaks the symmetry at time zero) and coincides with the thermalisation time. For intermediate subsystems, however, one can observe the so-called "quantum Mpemba effect", where the state of the system restores a symmetry faster if it is initially more asymmetric. We provide the first exact characterisation of this effect in a non-integrable system.

Title: Programmable time crystals from higher-order packing fields
Authors: R. Hurtado-Gutiérrez, C. Pérez-Espigares, P.I. Hurtado
Abstract: Time crystals are many-body systems that spontaneously break time-translation symmetry, and thus exhibit long-range spatiotemporal order and robust periodic motion. Recent results have demonstrated how to build time-crystal phases in driven diffusive fluids using an external packing field coupled to density fluctuations. Here we exploit this mechanism to engineer and control on-demand custom continuous time crystals characterized by an arbitrary number of rotating condensates, which can be further enhanced with higher-order modes. We elucidate the underlying critical point, as well as general properties of the condensates density profiles and velocities, demonstrating a scaling property of higher-order traveling condensates in terms of first-order ones. We illustrate our findings by solving the hydrodynamic equations for various paradigmatic driven diffusive systems, obtaining along the way a number of remarkable results, e.g. the possibility of explosive time crystal phases characterized by an abrupt, first-order-type transition. Overall, these results demonstrate the versatility and broad possibilities of this promising route to time crystals.

Title: Effective Affinity for Generic Currents in Markov Processes
Authors: Adarsh Raghu, Izaak Neri
Abstract: In nonequilibrium systems with uncoupled currents, the thermodynamic affinity determines the direction of currents, quantifies dissipation, and constrains current fluctuations. However, these properties of the thermodynamic affinity do not hold in complex systems with multiple coupled currents. For this reason, there has been an ongoing search in nonequilibrium thermodynamics for an affinity-like quantity, known as the effective affinity, which applies to a single current in a system with multiple coupled currents. Here, we introduce an effective affinity that applies to generic currents in time-homogeneous Markov processes. We show that the effective affinity is a single number encapsulating several dissipative and fluctuation properties of fluctuating currents: the effective affinity determines the direction of flow of the current; the effective affinity multiplied by the current is a lower bound for the rate of dissipation; for systems with uncoupled currents the effective affinity equals the standard thermodynamic affinity; and the effective affinity constrains negative fluctuations of currents, namely, it is the exponential decay constant of the distribution of current infima. We derive the above properties with large deviation theory and martingale theory, and one particular interesting finding is a class of martingales associated with generic currents. Furthermore, we make a study of the relation between effective affinities and stalling forces in a biomechanical model of motor proteins, and we find that both quantities are approximately equal when this particular model is thermodynamically consistent. This brings interesting perspectives on the use of stalling forces for the estimation of dissipation.

Title: Physical networks become what they learn
Authors: Menachem Stern, Marcelo Guzman, Felipe Martins, Andrea J Liu, Vijay Balasubramanian
Abstract: Physical networks can develop diverse responses, or functions, by design, evolution or learning. We focus on electrical networks of nodes connected by resistive edges. Such networks can learn by adapting edge conductances to lower a cost function that penalizes deviations from a desired response. The network must also satisfy Kirchhoff's law, balancing currents at nodes, or, equivalently, minimizing total power dissipation by adjusting node voltages. The adaptation is thus a double optimization process, in which a cost function is minimized with respect to conductances, while dissipated power is minimized with respect to node voltages. Here we study how this physical adaptation couples the cost landscape, the landscape of the cost function in the high-dimensional space of edge conductances, to the physical landscape, the dissipated power in the high-dimensional space of node voltages. We show how adaptation links the physical and cost Hessian matrices, suggesting that the physical response of networks to perturbations holds significant information about the functions to which they are adapted.

Title: Superballistic conduction in hydrodynamic antidot graphene superlattices
Authors: Jorge Estrada-Álvarez, Juan Salvador-Sánchez, Ana Pérez-Rodríguez, Carlos Sánchez-Sánchez, Vito Clericò, Daniel Vaquero, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Enrique Diez, Francisco Domínguez-Adame, Mario Amado, Elena Díaz
Abstract: Viscous electron flow exhibits exotic signatures such as superballistic conduction. In order to observe hydrodynamics effects, a 2D device where the current flow is as inhomogeneous as possible is desirable. To this end, we build three antidot graphene superlattices with different hole diameters. We measure their electrical properties at various temperatures and under the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field. We find an enhanced superballistic effect, suggesting the effectiveness of the geometry at bending the electron flow. In addition, superballistic conduction, which is related to a transition from a non-collective to a collective regime of transport, behaves non-monotonically with the magnetic field. We also analyze the device resistance as a function of the size of the antidot superlattice to find characteristic scaling laws describing the different transport regimes. We prove that the antidot superlattice is a convenient geometry for realizing hydrodynamic flow and provide valuable explanations for the technologically relevant effects of superballistic conduction and scaling laws.

Title: Quantum and Classical Dynamics with Random Permutation Circuits
Authors: Bruno Bertini, Katja Klobas, Pavel Kos, Daniel Malz
Abstract: Understanding thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is among the most enduring problems in modern physics. A particularly interesting question concerns the role played by quantum mechanics in this process, i.e. whether thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is fundamentally different from that in classical many-body systems and, if so, which of its features are genuinely quantum. Here we study this question in minimally structured many-body systems which are only constrained to have local interactions, i.e. local random circuits. We introduce a class of random permutation circuits (RPCs), where the gates locally permute basis states modelling generic microscopic classical dynamics, and compare them to random unitary circuits (RUCs), a standard toy model for generic quantum dynamics. We show that, like RUCs, RPCs permit the analytical computation of several key quantities such as out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs), or entanglement entropies. RPCs can be interpreted both as quantum or classical dynamics, which we use to find similarities and differences between the two. Performing the average over all random circuits, we discover a series of exact relations, connecting quantities in RUC and (quantum) RPCs. In the classical setting, we obtain similar exact results relating (quantum) purity to (classical) growth of mutual information and (quantum) OTOCs to (classical) decorrelators. Our results indicate that despite of the fundamental differences between quantum and classical systems, their dynamics exhibits qualitatively similar behaviours.

Title: Modeling shallow confinement in tuneable quantum dots
Authors: Austris Akmentinsh, Niels Ubbelohde, Vyacheslavs Kashcheyevs
Abstract: This paper proposes a universal microscopic model for the shallow confinement regime of single-electron tunneling devices. We consider particle escape from a quantum well generically emerging as a bifurcation in a smooth electrostatic potential and develop a set of analytic and numerical approximations for the ground-state tunneling and thermally activated escape rates. These approximations are applied to the problem of electron capture by a closing tunnel barrier where the competition between the closing speed and the escape rate defines a scaling relation for the capture fidelity. Effective one-dimensional cubic potential approximation leads to a universal form of this scaling relation in terms of device-independent dimensionless depth and speed parameters. Using predictions for temperature and magnetic-field dependence we show how to infer the energy scales of cubic longitudinal and quadratic transverse confinement. Finally, we derive an intrinsic quantum speed bound for adiabatic protection of the ground state tunneling and show that the latter can potentially be exploited up to the break down of confinement with a practical speed limit set by reaching the quantum uncertainty of the barrier height before the onset of non-adiabatic excitation. These results contribute to mapping out the physical limits of single-electron quantum technologies for electrical metrology and sensing.

Title: Elastic Screening of Pseudogauge Fields in Graphene
Authors: Christophe De Beule, Robin Smeyers, Wilson Nieto Luna, E. J. Mele, Lucian Covaci
Abstract: Lattice deformations in graphene couple to the low-energy electronic degrees of freedom as effective scalar and gauge fields. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the optical component of the displacement field, i.e., the relative motion of different sublattices, contributes at equal order as the acoustic component and effectively screens the pseudogauge fields. In particular, we consider twisted bilayer graphene and corrugated monolayer graphene. In both cases, optical lattice displacements significantly reduce the overall magnitude of the pseudomagnetic fields. For corrugated graphene, optical contributions also reshape the pseudomagnetic field and significantly modify the electronic bands near charge neutrality. Previous studies based on continuum elasticity, which ignores this effect, have therefore systematically overestimated the strength of the strain-induced pseudomagnetic field. Our results have important consequences for the interpretation of experiments and design of straintronic applications.

Title: Multi-orbital two-particle self-consistent approach -- strengths and limitations
Authors: Jonas B. Profe, Jiawei Yan, Karim Zantout, Philipp Werner, Roser Valentí
Abstract: Extending many-body numerical techniques which are powerful in the context of simple model calculations to the realm of realistic material simulations can be a challenging task. Realistic systems often involve multiple active orbitals, which increases the complexity and numerical cost because of the large local Hilbert space and the large number of interaction terms or sign-changing off-diagonal Green's functions. The two-particle self-consistent approach (TPSC) is one such many-body numerical technique, for which multi-orbital extensions have proven to be involved due to the substantially more complex structure of the local interaction tensor. In this paper we extend earlier multi-orbital generalizations of TPSC by setting up two different variants of a fully self-consistent theory for TPSC in multi-orbital systems. We first investigate the strengths and limitations of the approach analytically and then benchmark both variants against dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and D-TRILEX results. We find that the exact behavior of the system can be faithfully reproduced in the weak-coupling regime, while at stronger couplings the performance of the two TPSC variants strongly depends on details of the system.

Title: Contrasting dynamical properties of single-Q and triple-Q magnetic orderings in a triangular lattice antiferromagnet
Authors: Pyeongjae Park, Woonghee Cho, Chaebin Kim, Yeochan An, Kazuki Iida, Ryoichi Kajimoto, Sakib Matin, Shang-Shun Zhang, Cristian D. Batista, Je-Geun Park
Abstract: Multi-Q magnetic structures on triangular lattices, with their two-dimensional topological spin texture, have attracted significant interest. However, unambiguously confirming their formation by excluding the presence of three equally-populated single-Q domains remains challenging. In the metallic triangular lattice antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2, two magnetic ground states have been suggested at different temperature ranges, with the low-temperature phase being a triple-Q structure corresponding to the highest-density Skyrmion lattice. Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and advanced spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate a clear distinction in the excitation spectra between the single-Q and triple-Q phases of Co1/3TaS2 and, more generally, a triangular lattice. First, we refined the spin Hamiltonian by fitting the excitation spectra measured in its paramagnetic phase, allowing us to develop an unbiased model independent of magnetic ordering. Second, we observed that the two magnetically ordered phases in Co1/3TaS2 exhibit markedly different behaviors in their long-wavelength Goldstone modes. Our spin model, derived from the paramagnetic phase, confirms that these behaviors originate from the single-Q and triple-Q nature of the respective ordered phases, providing unequivocal evidence of the single-Q to triple-Q phase transition in Co1/3TaS2. Importantly, we propose that the observed contrast in the long-wavelength spin dynamics between the single-Q and triple-Q orderings is universal, offering a potentially unique way to distinguish a generic triple-Q ordering on a triangular lattice from its multi-domain single-Q counterparts. We describe its applicability with examples of similar hexagonal systems forming potential triple-Q orderings. (For the full abstract, please refer to the manuscript)

Title: Magnon spectroscopy in the electron microscope

Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.

Title: Two-particle calculations with quantics tensor trains: Solving the parquet equations
Authors: Stefan Rohshap, Marc K. Ritter, Hiroshi Shinaoka, Jan von Delft, Markus Wallerberger, Anna Kauch
Abstract: We present the first application of quantics tensor trains (QTTs) and tensor cross interpolation (TCI) to the solution of a full set of self-consistent equations for multivariate functions, the so-called parquet equations. We show that the steps needed to evaluate the equations (Bethe--Salpeter equations, parquet equation and Schwinger--Dyson equation) can be decomposed into basic operations on the QTT-TCI (QTCI) compressed objects. The repeated application of these operations does not lead to a loss of accuracy beyond a specified tolerance and the iterative scheme converges even for numerically demanding parameters. As examples we take the Hubbard model in the atomic limit and the single impurity Anderson model, where the basic objects in parquet equations, the two-particle vertices, depend on three frequencies, but not on momenta. The results show that this approach is able to overcome major computational bottlenecks of standard numerical methods. The applied methods allow for an exponential increase of the number of grid points included in the calculations leading to an exponentially improving computational error for a linear increase in computational cost.

Title: Multifunctional steep-slope spintronic transistors with spin-gapless-semiconductor or spin-gapped-metal electrodes
Authors: Ersoy Şaşıoğlu, Paul Bodewei, Nicki F. Hinsche, Ingrid Mertig
Abstract: Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications, enabling functions beyond conventional electronics. This study introduces a novel design for multifunctional spintronic field-effect transistors (FETs) using SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as source and drain electrodes. These devices operate similarly to metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms between the SGS (or SGM) electrode and the semiconducting channel. Unlike traditional Schottky barrier FETs, these devices utilize the unique spin-dependent transport properties of SGS/SGM electrodes to achieve sub-60 mV/dec switching, overcoming the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing limit in MOSFETs for low-voltage operation. Additionally, SGMs contribute a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current ratio. The proposed spintronic FETs combine sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR), and NDR, making them suitable for applications like logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These properties support computing architectures beyond the von-Neumann model, enabling efficient data processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials provide a promising platform for these multifunctional FETs. We screen a computational 2D materials database to identify suitable SGS and SGM materials, selecting VS$2$ as the SGS for simulations. Using a non-equilibrium Green's function method with density functional theory, we simulate transfer ($I{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{G}}$) and output ($I_{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{D}}$) characteristics of a VS$_2$/Ga$_2$O$_2$ FET based on 2D type-II SGS VS$_2$, predicting a sub-threshold swing of 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 10$^8$, and a notable non-local GMR effect, demonstrating potential for low-power, high-performance applications.

Title: Advancing Electrochemical CO$_2$ Capture with Redox-Active Metal-Organic Frameworks

Abstract: Addressing climate change calls for action to control CO$_2$ pollution. Direct air and ocean capture offer a solution to this challenge. Making carbon capture competitive with alternatives, such as forestation and mineralisation, requires fundamentally novel approaches and ideas. One such approach is electrosorption, which is currently limited by the availability of suitable electrosorbents. In this work, we introduce a metal-organic copper-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$) metal-organic framework (MOF) that can act as electrosorbent for CO$_2$ capture, thereby expanding the palette of materials that can be used for this process. Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ is the first MOF to switch its ability to capture and release CO$_2$ in aqueous electrolytes. By using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis, and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), we demonstrate reversible CO$_2$ electrosorption. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide atomistic insights into the mechanism of electrosorption and conclude that efficient CO$_2$ capture is facilitated by a combination of redox-active copper atom and aromatic HHTP ligand within Cu3(HHTP)2. By showcasing the applicability of Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ -- with a CO$_2$ capacity of 2 mmol g$^{-1}$ and an adsorption enthalpy of -20 kJ mol$^{-1}$ - this study encourages further exploration of conductive redox-active MOFs in the search for superior CO$_2$ electrosorbents.

Title: Transition temperature and thermodynamic properties of homogeneous weakly interacting Bose gas in self-consistent Popov approximation
Authors: Nguyen Van Thu, Pham Duy Thanh, Lo Thi Thuy
Abstract: This study utilizes the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action approach combined with variational perturbation theory to investigate the relative shift in the transition temperature of a homogeneous, repulsive, weakly interacting Bose gas compared to that of an ideal Bose gas. By applying both the one-loop and self-consistent Popov approximations, the universal form of the relative shift in the transition temperature is derived, demonstrating its proportionality to the s-wave scattering length. The results exhibit excellent agreement with those obtained from precise Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the zero-point energy and various thermodynamic properties are examined in both the condensed and normal phases. A comparison with experimental data reveals an excellent agreement, further validating the findings.

Title: How glass breaks -- Damage explains the difference between surface and fracture energies in amorphous silica
Authors: Gergely Molnár, Etienne Barthel
Abstract: The difference between free surface energy and fracture toughness in amorphous silica is studied via multi-scale simulations. We combine the homogenization of a molecular dynamics fracture model with a phase-field approach to track and quantify the various energy contributions. We clearly separate free surface energy localized as potential energy on the surface and damage diffusion over a 16-23 A range around the crack path. The plastic contribution is negligible. These findings, which clarify brittle fracture mechanisms in amorphous materials, align with toughness measurements in silica.

Title: Instability of the ferromagnetic phase under random fields in an Ising spin glass with correlated disorder
Authors: Hidetoshi Nishimori
Abstract: It is well established that the ferromagnetic phase remains stable under random magnetic fields in three and higher dimensions for the ferromagnetic Ising model and the Edwards-Anderson model of spin glasses without correlation in the disorder variables. In this study, we investigate an Ising spin glass with correlated disorder and demonstrate that the ferromagnetic phase becomes unstable under random fields in any dimension, provided that magnetic field chaos exists in the Edwards-Anderson model on the same lattice. Additionally, we show that this instability can also be attributed to disorder (bond) chaos. We further argue that the model with correlated disorder remains in the ferromagnetic phase even in the presence of symmetry-breaking fields, as long as the Edwards-Anderson model on the same lattice exhibits a spin glass phase under a magnetic field. These results underscore the profound impact of spatial correlations in the disorder.

Title: Crossed Andreev reflection in collinear $p$-wave magnet/triplet superconductor junctions
Authors: Abhiram Soori
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a fundamental quantum transport phenomenon that holds significant implications for spintronics and superconducting devices. However, its experimental detection and enhancement remain challenging. Recently, magnetic materials exhibiting $p$-wave magnetic ordering, distinct from conventional spin-orbit coupling, referred to as $p$-wave magnets, have attracted considerable interest. In this work, we propose a junction consisting of $p$-wave magnets and a triplet superconductor as a promising platform to enhance CAR. The setup features a triplet superconductor sandwiched between two collinear $p$-wave magnets rotated by $180^\circ$ relative to each other, allowing for precise control over transport processes. We demonstrate that CAR can dominate over electron tunneling (ET) within specific parameter regimes, such as the orientation angle of the $p$-wave magnets and their chemical potential. Enhanced CAR occurs when the constant energy contours of the two spins in the $p$-wave magnets are well-separated. Furthermore, the conductivities display Fabry-Pérot-type oscillations due to interference effects, with CAR diminishing as the length of the superconductor exceeds the decay length of the wavefunctions. These findings underscore the potential of collinear $p$-wave magnet-superconductor junctions as a robust platform for the experimental investigation and enhancement of CAR.

Title: Disordered Weyl semimetal as an array of coupled Hubbard chains
Authors: Jinmin Yi, A.A. Burkov
Abstract: We demonstrate that a disordered magnetic Weyl semimetal may be mapped onto a two-dimensional array of coupled replicated Hubbard chains, where the Hubbard $U$ is directly related to the variance of the disorder potential. This is a three-dimensional generalization of a similar mapping of the two-dimensional quantum Hall plateau transition to a one-dimensional Hubbard chain. We demonstrate that this mapping leads to the conclusion that the Weyl semimetal becomes a diffusive metal with a nonzero density of states at arbitrarily weak disorder, in agreement with recent work. We also discuss the absence of localization in strongly disordered Weyl semimetals from the viewpoint of this mapping.

Title: Highly efficient field-free switching by orbital Hall torque in a MoS2-based device operating at room temperature
Authors: Antonio Bianco, Michele Ceccardi, Raimondo Cecchini, Daniele Marre', Chanchal K. Barman, Fabio Bernardini, Alessio Filippetti, Federico Caglieris, Ilaria Pallecchi
Abstract: Charge-to-spin and spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms in high spin-orbit materials are the new frontier of memory devices. They operate via spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching of a magnetic electrode, driven by an applied charge current. In this work, we propose a novel memory device based on the semiconducting two-dimensional centrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) MoS2, that operates as a SOT device in the writing process and a spin valve in the reading process. We demonstrate that stable voltage states at room temperature can be deterministically controlled by a switching current density as low as 3.2x10^4 A/cm^2 even in zero field, owed to a tilted geometry and a differential voltage architecture. An applied field of 50-100 Oe can be used as a characterizing control parameter for the state switching. Ab initio calculations of spin Hall effect (SHE) and orbital Hall effect (OHE) point to the latter as the most likely responsible for the generation of the SOT in the magnetic electrode. The large value of OHC in bulk MoS2 makes our device competitive in terms of energetic efficiency and could be integrated in TMD heterostructures to design memory devices with multiple magnetization states for non-Boolean computation.

Authors: Elena Agliari, Andrea Alessandrelli, Paulo Duarte Mourao, Alberto Fachechi
Abstract: We consider $L$-directional associative memories, composed of $L$ Hopfield networks, displaying imitative Hebbian intra-network interactions and anti-imitative Hebbian inter-network interactions, where couplings are built over a set of hidden binary patterns. We evaluate the model's performance in reconstructing the whole set of hidden binary patterns when provided with mixtures of noisy versions of these patterns. Our numerical results demonstrate the model's high effectiveness in the reconstruction task for structureless and structured datasets.

Title: A first principles approach to electromechanics in liquids
Authors: Anna T. Bui, Stephen J. Cox
Abstract: Electromechanics in fluids describes the response of the number density to electric fields, and thus provides a powerful means by which to control the behavior of liquids. While continuum approaches have proven successful in describing electromechanical phenomena in macroscopic bodies, their use is questionable when relevant length scales become comparable to a system's natural correlation lengths, as commonly occurs in, e.g., biological systems, nanopores, and microfluidics. Here, we present a first principles theory for electromechanical phenomena in fluids. Our approach is based on the recently proposed hyperdensity functional theory [Sammüller et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024)] in which we treat the charge density as an observable of the system, with the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional dependent upon both density and electrostatic potential. Expressions for the coupling between number and charge densities emerge naturally in this formalism, avoiding the need to construct density-dependent and spatially-varying material parameters such as the dielectric constant. Furthermore, we make our theory practical by deriving a connection between hyperdensity functional theory and local molecular field theory, which facilitates machine learning explicit representations for the free energy functionals of systems with short-ranged electrostatic interactions, with long-ranged effects accounted for in a well-controlled mean field fashion.

Title: Strain-induced non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect
Authors: Wancheng Zhang, Mingkun Zheng, Yong Liu, Rui Xiong, Zhenhua Zhang, Zhihong Lu
Abstract: Recently, the large time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) spin current generated by the non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) has demonstrated significant potential for spintronic applications, with both computational and experimental validations. However, considering the broad application prospects and the scarcity of conductive altermagnetic materials, the development of novel reliable methods for inducing altermagnetism is necessary. Here, strain engineering is proposed as a simple yet effective approach. This work focuses on $\mathrm{OsO}_2$--the $5d$ counterpart of $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ sharing the rutile structure--employing $ab~initio$ calculations to systematically investigate strain effects on its ASSE. We find that applying a minor equibiaxial tensile strain $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ to $\mathrm{OsO}_2$ can induce a transition from non-magnetic to altermagnetic states. Only $3\%$ $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ is required to achieve a spin-charge conversion ratio ($\theta_{\text{AS}}$) of $\sim7\%$ for the $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin current generated by ASSE, far exceeding the intrinsic spin Hall angle $\theta_{\text{IS}}$ produced by the conventional spin Hall effect (CSHE). Calculations reveal that substantial $\theta_{\text{AS}}$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to non-relativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirms the strain-induced ASSE's non-relativistic origin. Further calculations reveal that $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties. Our research opens new simple pathways for developing next-generation altermagnetic spintronic devices.

Title: Prospect for measuring work statistics in quantum coherent systems
Authors: Cheolhee Han, Nadav Katz, Eran Sela
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics is concerned with heat and work exchange between a quantum coherent system and heat reservoirs or work agents. In stochastic thermodynamics a key object of interest is the statistics of these quantities, but it is notoriously difficult to measure it in general systems. Here we discuss the prospect for measuring work statistics in electronic devices, via a study of a transmon-microcavity system. The microwave cavity acts as a work agent, exchanging work with the transmon. We formulate a protocol to measure the first moments of work $\langle W^n \rangle$ via photon number detection. We find conditions for capturing quantum coherence in the work statistics. Interestingly, by measuring higher moments one can verify the Jarzynski equality $\langle e^{-W/T} \rangle = 1$ including quantum interference. Our work opens a way for measuring work statistics in nontrivial quantum systems.

Title: Equivalent Electric Model of a Macrospin
Authors: Steven Louis, Hannah Bradley, Vasyl Tyberkevych
Abstract: Dynamics of a ferromagnetic macrospin (e.g., a free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)) can be described in terms of equivalent capacitor charge $Q$ and inductor flux $\Phi$, in a manner similar to a standard electric LC circuit, but with strongly nonlinear and coupled capacitance and inductance. This description allows for the inclusion of Gilbert damping and spin transfer torques and yields a relatively simple equivalent electric circuit, which can be easily modeled in LTspice or other electrical engineering software. It allows one to easily simulate advanced electrical circuits containing MTJs and conventional electronic components in standard simulation software.

Title: A Physics-Based Circuit Model for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions
Authors: Steven Louis, Hannah Bradley, Artem Litvinenko, Vasyl Tyberkevych
Abstract: This work presents an equivalent circuit model for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) that accurately captures their magnetization dynamics and electrical behavior. Implemented in LTspice, the model is validated against direct numerical solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation. It effectively simulates essential spintronic phenomena, including ferromagnetic resonance, field- and spin-torque-induced switching, and spin-torque-induced oscillations. Simulation results demonstrate strong agreement between LTspice and LLGS solutions, confirming the model accuracy and utility for efficient circuit-level analysis of spintronic devices. The ability to incorporate time-dependent magnetic fields and voltage inputs makes the proposed model suitable for diverse applications such as neuromorphic computing, microwave signal processing, and spintronic memory technologies. By providing a computationally efficient yet physically accurate circuit representation, this work enables seamless integration of MTJs into larger electronic systems, potentially accelerating the development of advanced spintronic circuit architectures.

Title: Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of vacuum decay
Authors: Alexander C. Jenkins, Hiranya V. Peiris, Andrew Pontzen
Abstract: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.

Abstract: Triggered by the development of exfoliation and the identification of a wide range of extraordinary physical properties in self-standing films consisting of one or few atomic layers, two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and other van der Waals (vdW) crystals currently constitute a wide research field protruding in multiple directions in combination with layer stacking and twisting, nanofabrication, surface-science methods, and integration into nanostructured environments. Photonics encompasses a multidisciplinary collection of those directions, where 2D materials contribute with polaritons of unique characteristics such as strong spatial confinement, large optical-field enhancement, long lifetimes, high sensitivity to external stimuli (e.g., electric and magnetic fields, heating, and strain), a broad spectral range from the far infrared to the ultraviolet, and hybridization with spin and momentum textures of electronic band structures. The explosion of photonics with 2D materials as a vibrant research area is producing breakthroughs, including the discovery and design of new materials and metasurfaces with unprecedented properties as well as applications in integrated photonics, light emission, optical sensing, and exciting prospects for applications in quantum information, and nanoscale thermal transport. This Roadmap summarizes the state of the art in the field, identifies challenges and opportunities, and discusses future goals and how to meet them through a wide collection of topical sections prepared by leading practitioners.

Title: Quantum controlling and the topological properties of the magnon photo-transport in two-dimensional collinear ferromagnet
Authors: Jun-Cen Li, An Du
Abstract: In our work, we study magnon transport induced by light through Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect, including magnon spin photocurrent (MSPC) and magnon energy photocurrent (MEPC). Firstly, we regard the effect of the electric field on the magnon through the AC effect as a perturbation. Then we derived the expressions of MSPC and MEPC in two-dimensional collinear ferromagnetic system. And we apply our theory to the two-dimension ferromagnetic Hexagonal and Kagome lattice. We find that the optical frequency and the relaxation time of the material can be used to control the photo-transport of magnons. In addition, under the condition of low light frequncy and infinite relaxation time, the longitudinal magnon photo-transport is related to the topological property of the magnon system.

Title: Screening of material defects using universal machine-learning interatomic potentials
Authors: Ethan Berger, Mohammad Bagheri, Hannu-Pekka Komsa
Abstract: Finding new materials with previously unknown atomic structure or materials with optimal set of properties for a specific application greatly benefits from computational modeling. Recently, such screening has been dramatically accelerated by the invent of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials that offer first principles accuracy at orders of magnitude lower computational cost. Their application to the screening of defects with desired properties or to finding new stable compounds with high density of defects, however, has not been explored. Here, we show that the universal machine-learning interatomic potentials have reached sufficient accuracy to enable large-scale screening of defective materials. We carried out vacancy calculations for 86 259 materials in the Materials Project database and analyzed the formation energies in terms of oxidation numbers. We further demonstrate the application of these models for finding new materials at or below the convex hull of known materials and for simulated etching of low-dimensional materials.

Title: Universal Scaling Laws of Absorbing Phase Transitions in Artificial Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Keiichi Tamai, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Truong Vinh Truong Duy, Naotake Natori, Synge Todo
Abstract: We demonstrate that conventional artificial deep neural networks operating near the phase boundary of the signal propagation dynamics, also known as the edge of chaos, exhibit universal scaling laws of absorbing phase transitions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We exploit the fully deterministic nature of the propagation dynamics to elucidate an analogy between a signal collapse in the neural networks and an absorbing state (a state that the system can enter but cannot escape from). Our numerical results indicate that the multilayer perceptrons and the convolutional neural networks belong to the mean-field and the directed percolation universality classes, respectively. Also, the finite-size scaling is successfully applied, suggesting a potential connection to the depth-width trade-off in deep learning. Furthermore, our analysis of the training dynamics under the gradient descent reveals that hyperparameter tuning to the phase boundary is necessary but insufficient for achieving optimal generalization in deep networks. Remarkably, nonuniversal metric factors associated with the scaling laws are shown to play a significant role in concretizing the above observations. These findings highlight the usefulness of the notion of criticality for analyzing the behavior of artificial deep neural networks and offer new insights toward a unified understanding of the essential relationship between criticality and intelligence.

Title: Intertwining the Busemann process of the directed polymer model
Authors: Erik Bates, Wai-Tong Louis Fan, Timo Seppäläinen
Abstract: We study the Busemann process and competition interfaces of the planar directed polymer model with i.i.d.\ weights on the vertices of the planar square lattice, in both the general case and the solvable inverse-gamma case. We prove new regularity properties of the Busemann process without reliance on unproved assumptions on the shape function. For example, each nearest-neighbor Busemann function is strictly monotone and has the same random set of discontinuities in the direction variable. When all Busemann functions on a horizontal line are viewed together, the Busemann process intertwines with an evolution that obeys a version of the geometric Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence. When specialized to the inverse-gamma case, this relationship enables an explicit distributional description: the Busemann function on a nearest-neighbor edge has independent increments in the direction variable, and its distribution comes from an inhomogeneous planar Poisson process. The distribution of the asymptotic competition interface direction of the inverse-gamma polymer is discrete and supported on the Busemann discontinuities which -- unlike in zero-temperature last-passage percolation -- are dense. Further implications follow for the eternal solutions and the failure of the one force -- one solution principle of the discrete stochastic heat equation solved by the polymer partition function.

Title: Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Aiichi Iwazaki
Abstract: Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or higher and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz despite a low temperature of 35 mK and a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes. These unexpected results are caused by axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. By comparing the axion effect with thermal effect on the width $\Delta B$, we have shown the dominance of the axion effect over thermal effect at low temperature less than $50$mK. The dominance of the axion effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.

Title: Towards scalable active steering protocols for genuinely entangled state manifolds
Authors: Samuel Morales, Silvia Pappalardi, Reinhold Egger
Abstract: We introduce and analyze an active steering protocol designed to target multipartite entangled states. The protocol involves multiple qubits subjected to weak Bell pair measurements with active feedback, where the feedback operations are optimized to maximize the Quantum Fisher Information. Our scheme efficiently reaches a genuinely entangled one-parameter state manifold. Numerical simulations for systems with up to 22 qubits suggest that the protocol is scalable and allows high multipartite entanglement across the system.

Title: Manifolds of exceptional points and effective Zeno limit of an open two-qubit system
Authors: Vladislav Popkov, Carlo Presilla, Mario Salerno
Abstract: We analytically investigate the Liouvillian exceptional point manifolds (LEPMs) of a two-qubit open system, where one qubit is coupled to a dissipative polarization bath. Exploiting a Z_2 symmetry, we block-diagonalize the Liouvillian and show that one symmetry block yields two planar LEPMs while the other one exhibits a more intricate, multi-sheet topology. The intersection curves of these manifolds provide a phase diagram for effective Zeno transitions at small dissipation. These results are consistent with a perturbative extrapolation from the strong Zeno regime. Interestingly, we find that the fastest relaxation to the non-equilibrium steady state occurs on LEPMs associated with the transition to the effective Zeno regime.

Title: Emergent weight morphologies in deep neural networks
Authors: Pascal de Jong, Felix Meigel, Steffen Rulands
Abstract: Whether deep neural networks can exhibit emergent behaviour is not only relevant for understanding how deep learning works, it is also pivotal for estimating potential security risks of increasingly capable artificial intelligence systems. Here, we show that training deep neural networks gives rise to emergent weight morphologies independent of the training data. Specifically, in analogy to condensed matter physics, we derive a theory that predict that the homogeneous state of deep neural networks is unstable in a way that leads to the emergence of periodic channel structures. We verified these structures by performing numerical experiments on a variety of data sets. Our work demonstrates emergence in the training of deep neural networks, which impacts the achievable performance of deep neural networks.

Title: Geometric origin of self-intersection points in non-Hermitian energy spectra
Authors: Jinghui Pi, Chenyang Wang, Yong-Chun Liu, Yangqian Yan
Abstract: Unlike Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian energy spectra under periodic boundary conditions can form closed loops in the complex energy plane, a phenomenon known as point gap topology. In this paper, we investigate the self-intersection points of such non-Hermitian energy spectra and reveal their geometric origins. We rigorously demonstrate that these self-intersection points result from the intersection of the auxiliary generalized Brillouin zone and the Brillouin zone in one-band systems, as confirmed by an extended Hatano-Nelson model. This finding is further generalized to multi-band systems, illustrated through a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Moreover, we address multiple self-intersection points and derive the geometric conditions for general n-fold self-intersection points. Our results enhance the fundamental understanding of generic non-Hermitian quantum systems and provide theoretical support for further experimental investigations of energy self-intersection points.

Title: Modelling of the dewetting of ultra-thin liquid films on chemically patterned substrates: linear spectrum and deposition patterns
Authors: Tilman Richter, Paolo Malgaretti, Jens Harting
Abstract: Liquid films of nanometric thickness are prone to spinodal dewetting driven by disjoining pressure, meaning that a non-wetting liquid film of homogeneous thickness in the range of tens of nanometers will spontaneously break into droplets. The surface energy of the underlying solid substrate heavily influences the dynamics and resulting droplet configurations. Here, we study the dewetting of thin liquid films on physically flat but chemically heterogeneous substrates using the thin film equation. We use linear stability analysis (LSA) to describe and predict the system's behavior until the film ruptures and compare it to numerical simulations. The good agreement between the numerical solutions and the LSA allows us to propose a method for measuring surface energy patterns from early time-step film height profiles with good precision. Furthermore, we study the non-linear dynamics and the eventually formed droplet pattern by numerical simulations. This offers insights into the dependency of the resultant droplet arrays on shape, feature size, and magnitude of the chemical patterning of the underlying substrate.

Title: Feedback controlled microengine powered by motor protein
Authors: Suraj Deshmukh, Basudha Roy, Sougata Guha, Shivprasad Patil, Arnab Saha, Sudipto Muhuri
Abstract: We present a template for realization of a novel microengine which is able to harness and convert the activity driven movement of individual motor protein into work output of the system. This engine comprises of a micron size bead-motor protein complex that is subject to a time-varying, feedback controlled optical potential, and a driving force due to the action of the motor protein which stochastically binds, walks and unbinds to an underlying microtubule filament. Using a Stochastic thermodynamics framework and theoretical modeling of bead-motor transport in a harmonic optical trap potential, we obtain the engine characteristics, e.g., work output per cycle, power generated, efficiency and the probability distribution function of the work output as a function of motor parameters and optical trap stiffness. The proposed engine is a work-to-work converter. Remarkably, the performance of this engine can vastly supersede the performance of other microengines that have been realized so far for feasible biological parameter range for kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 motor proteins. In particular, the work output per cycle is ~ (10-15) k_b T while the power output is (5-8) k_b T s^{-1}. Furthermore, we find that even with time delay in feedback protocol, the performance of the engine remains robust as long as the delay time is much smaller than the Brownian relaxation time of the micron size bead. Indeed such low delay time in feedback in the optical trap setup can easily be achieved with current Infrared (IR) lasers and optical trap sensor. The average work output and power output of the engine, exhibits interesting non-monotonic dependence on motor velocity and optical trap stiffness. As such this motor protein driven microengine can be a promising potential prototype for fabricating an actual microdevice engine which can have practical utility.

Title: Direct-Write Printed Contacts to Layered and 2D Materials
Authors: Sharadh Jois, Erica Lee, Philip Li, Tsegereda Esatu, Jason Fleischer, Edwin Quinn, Genda Gu, Vadym Kulichenko, Luis Balicas, Son T. Le, Samuel W. LaGasse, Aubrey T. Hanbicki, Adam L. Friedman
Abstract: Advancements in fabrication methods have shaped new computing device technologies. Among these methods, depositing electrical contacts to the channel material is fundamental to device characterization. Novel layered and two-dimensional (2D) materials are promising for next-generation computing electronic channel materials. Direct-write printing of conductive inks is introduced as a surprisingly effective, significantly faster, and cleaner method to contact different classes of layered materials, including graphene (semi-metal), MoS2 (semiconductor), Bi-2212 (superconductor), and Fe5GeTe2 (metallic ferromagnet). Based on the electrical response, the quality of the printed contacts is comparable to what is achievable with resist-based lithography techniques. These devices are tested by sweeping gate voltage, temperature, and magnetic field to show that the materials remain pristine post-processing. This work demonstrates that direct-write printing is an agile method for prototyping and characterizing the electrical properties of novel layered materials.

Title: Dissipation and non-thermal states in cryogenic cavities
Authors: Zeno Bacciconi, Giulia Piccitto, Alessandro Maria Verga, Giuseppe Falci, Elisabetta Paladino, Giuliano Chiriacò
Abstract: We study the properties of photons in a cryogenic cavity, made by cryo-cooled mirrors surrounded by a room temperature environment. We model such a system as a multimode cavity coupled to two thermal reservoirs at different temperatures. Using a Lindblad master equation approach, we derive the photon distribution and the statistical properties of the cavity modes, finding an overall non-thermal state described by a mode-dependent effective temperature. We also calculate the dissipation rates arising from the interaction of the cavity field with the external environment and the mirrors, relating such rates to measurable macroscopic quantities. These results provide a simple theory to calculate the dissipative properties and the effective temperature of a cavity coupled to different thermal reservoirs, offering potential pathways for engineering dissipations and photon statistics in cavity settings.
