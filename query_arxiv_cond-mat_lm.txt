Title: Photoluminescence from metal nanostructures -- dependence on size
Authors: Imon Kalyan, Ieng Wai Un, Gilles Rosolen, Nir Shitrit, Yonatan Sivan
Abstract: For decades, there have been multiple seemingly contradicting experimental reports on the dependence of the photoluminescence from metal nanostructures on their size. We reconcile these reports using a simple analytic formula which is found to match well photoluminescence measurements for a range of structures and illumination conditions. Our expression requires only knowledge of the local electric field and temperature, and it points to the physical quantities that determine the emission strength and its dependence on size.

Title: Parity Metamaterials and Dynamic Acoustic Mimicry
Authors: Jinjie Shi, Hongchen Chu, Aurelien Merkel, Chenkai Liu, Johan Christensen, Xiaozhou Liu, Yun Lai
Abstract: While parity transformation represents a fundamental symmetry operation in physics, its implications remain underexplored in metamaterial science. Here, we introduce a framework leveraging parity transformation to construct parity-inverted counterparts of arbitrary three-dimensional meta-atoms, enabling the creation of parity-engineered metamaterial slabs. We demonstrate that the synergy between reciprocity and parity transformation, distinct from mirror operation, guarantees undistorted wave transmission across exceptional bandwidths, independent of structural configuration or meta-atom design specifics. Furthermore, these metamaterials exhibit dynamic acoustic mimicry capability, enabling adaptive blending of reflected signatures into surrounding environments while preserving transmitted wavefront integrity. Validated through numerical simulations and experimental prototypes, this breakthrough offers transformative potential for acoustic camouflage applications, particularly for sonar systems. Our findings reveal fundamental implications of parity transformation in artificial materials, establishing parity engineering as a paradigm for designing ultra-broadband functional materials with unprecedented operational versatility.

Title: The semi-classical Floquet-Markov master equation for Monte Carlo spin integration
Authors: Raymond Tat
Abstract: In designing an experiment to measure a neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM), it is often necessary to determine the behavior of an ensemble of spins under time-dependent and randomly fluctuating magnetic fields. This is particularly relevant for the proposed nEDM@SNS experiment, which features ultra-cold neutrons (UCNs) and helium-3 atoms occupying the same measurement cell, as well as a sinusoidal dressing field. In this work, we investigate a new technique to calculate the frequency shifts arising from magnetic field inhomogeneities and motional magnetic fields, particularly in the case where the spins in question are subjected to a time-periodic magnetic field. The method is based on Floquet theory, a general framework for analyzing periodic linear differential equations, and Redfield theory, which governs the time evolution of the density matrix in the presence of weak couplings to an environment. We benchmark the results against the analytical results derived for the static magnetic field case, as well as against the results of a conventional Runge-Kutta integrator, and find agreement with both. We further study the performance of the method, and find order-of-magnitude improvements in runtime over the conventional integrator.

Title: 3D variational autoencoder for fingerprinting microstructure volume elements
Authors: Michael D. White, Michael D. Atkinson, Adam J. Plowman, Pratheek Shanthraj
Abstract: Microstructure quantification is an important step towards establishing structure-property relationships in materials. Machine learning-based image processing methods have been shown to outperform conventional image processing techniques and are increasingly applied to microstructure quantification tasks. In this work, we present a 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) for encoding microstructure volume elements (VEs) comprising voxelated crystallographic orientation data. Crystal symmetries in the orientation space are accounted for by mapping to the crystallographic fundamental zone as a preprocessing step, which allows for a continuous loss function to be used and improves the training convergence rate. The VAE is then used to encode a training set of VEs with an equiaxed polycrystalline microstructure with random texture. Accurate reconstructions are achieved with a relative average misorientation error of 9x10-3 on the test dataset, for a continuous latent space with dimension 256. We show that the model generalises well to microstructures with textures, grain sizes and aspect ratios outside the training distribution. Structure-property relationships are explored through using the training set of VEs as initial configurations in various crystal plasticity (CP) simulations. Microstructural fingerprints extracted from the VAE, which parameterise the VEs in a low-dimensional latent space, are stored alongside the volume-averaged stress response, at each strain increment, to uniaxial tensile deformation from CP simulations. This is then used to train a fully connected neural network mapping the input fingerprint to the resulting stress response, which acts as a surrogate model for the CP simulation. The fingerprint-based surrogate model is shown to accurately predict the microstructural dependence in the CP stress response, with a relative mean-squared error of 8.9x10-4 on unseen test data.

Title: Dynamics of Transition Metal Ion Transport in High-Gradient Magnetic Fields
Authors: Prateek Benhal, Muhammad Garba, Jamel Ali, Theo Siegrist, Munir Humayun, Hadi Mohammadigoushki
Abstract: Magnetic separation has emerged as an eco-friendly and sustainable technique with applications in water purification, chemical separation, biochemical, medical, and mining. In this study, we present, a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the transport of transition metal ions using high-gradient magnetic fields. Experiments were conducted on aqueous solutions containing either paramagnetic manganese chloride (MnCl$_$2) or diamagnetic zinc chloride (ZnCl$_$2) ions, with concentrations ranging from 1 mM to 100 mM under a non-uniform magnetic field of an electromagnet. Our results demonstrate that while paramagnetic MnCl$_$2 is captured by the mesh wool in the magnetic field, diamagnetic ZnCl$_$2 remains unaffected by the presence of magnetic field. The capture efficiency of paramagnetic MnCl$_$2 increases with both the initial ion concentration and the applied magnetic field strength. Furthermore, in binary mixtures, the capture rate of MnCl2 is reduced compared to single-ion solutions, highlighting the role of ion interactions in magnetic separation. Our theoretical modeling indicates that magnetic capture is governed by a balance between magnetic forces and viscous forces. Additionally, the magnetic separation process is enhanced by the field-induced cluster formation of paramagnetic metal ions, which are predicted to be two orders of magnitude larger than individual hydrated ion units. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of magnetic transport of metal ions and offer potential pathways for improving separation efficiency in complex ion mixtures that contain critical materials.

Title: Random batch list method for metallic system with embedded atom potential
Authors: Jieqiong Zhang, Jizu Huang, Zihao Yang
Abstract: The embedded atom method (EAM) is one of the most widely used many-body, short-range potentials in molecular dynamics simulations, particularly for metallic systems. To enhance the efficiency of calculating these short-range interactions, we extend the random batch list (RBL) concept to the EAM potential, resulting in the RBL-EAM algorithm. The newly presented method introduces two "core-shell" lists for approximately computing the host electron densities and the force terms, respectively. Direct interactions are computed in the core regions, while in the shell zones a random batch list is used to reduce the number of interaction pairs, leading to significant reductions in both computational complexity and storage requirements. We provide a theoretical, unbiased estimate of the host electron densities and the force terms. Since metallic systems are Newton-pair systems, we extend the RBL-EAM algorithm to exploit this property, thereby halving the computational cost. Numerical examples, including the lattice constant, the radial distribution function, and the elastic constants, demonstrate that the RBL-EAM method significantly accelerates simulations several times without compromising accuracy.

Title: Stereological 3D modeling of nano-scale catalyst particles using TEM projections
Authors: Lukas Fuchs, Kerstin Wein, Jens Friedland, Orkun Furat, Robert Güttel, Volker Schmidt
Abstract: Catalysis, particularly heterogeneous catalysis, is crucial in the chemical industry and energy storage. Approximately 80% of all chemical products produced by heterogeneous catalysis are produced by solid catalysts, which are essential for the synthesizing of ammonia, methanol, and hydrocarbons. Despite extensive use, challenges in catalyst development remain, including enhancing selectivity, stability, and activity. These effective properties are influenced by the nanoscale morphology of the catalysts, whereby the size of the nanoparticles is only one key descriptor. To investigate the relationship between nanoparticle morphology and catalytic performance, a comprehensive 3D analysis of nano-scale catalyst particles is necessary. However, traditional imaging techniques for a representative recording of this size range, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), are mostly limited to 2D. Thus, in the present paper, a stochastic 3D model is developed for a data-driven analysis of the nanostructure of catalyst particles. The calibration of this model is achieved using 2D TEM data from two different length scales, allowing for a statistically representative 3D modeling of catalyst particles. Furthermore, digital twins of catalyst particles can be drawn for the stochastic 3D model for virtual materials testing, enhancing the understanding of the relationship between catalyst nanostructure and performance.

Title: Observation of Persistent Zero Modes and Superconducting Vortex Doublets in UTe$_2$
Authors: Nileema Sharma, Matthew Toole, James McKenzie, Fangjun Cheng, Sean Michael Thomas, Priscila F. S. Rosa, Yi-Ting Hsu, Xiaolong Liu
Abstract: Superconducting vortices can reveal electron pairing details and nucleate topologically protected states. Yet, vortices of bulk spin-triplet superconductors have never been visualized. Recently, UTe$_2$ has emerged as a nominative spin-triplet superconductor, but its superconducting order parameter is elusive, and whether time-reversal symmetry is broken remains unsettled. Here, we visualize superconducting vortices on the (011) surface of ultra-clean UTe$_2$ single crystals ($T_c=2.1 K$) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We introduce $\frac{d^2 I}{dV^2}$ imaging as an effective method for vortex visualization in superconductors with substantial residual zero-energy density of states (DOS), as in UTe$_2$. Anisotropic single-flux-quantum vortices, with coherence lengths of $\sim$ 12 nm (4 nm) parallel (perpendicular) to the a-axis, form a triangular vortex lattice (VL) under small out-of-plane magnetic fields. The vortex size decreases at higher fields, suggesting multi-band superconductivity. The robustness of vortex structures and VL against magnetic field polarity and cooling history strongly supports time-reversal invariant superconductivity. Spatially non-splitting and spectroscopically narrow zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) of differential conductance at vortex cores (VCs) persist up $8T$, well beyond the Pauli limit ($3.9T$), consistent with Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in a topological vortex line protected by a combination of mirror, time-reversal, and particle-hole symmetries. Close examination of vortex structures reveals a mirror-asymmetric doublet $--$ one with a singular core and another with an enhanced energy gap. Such unconventional vortices in a non-chiral $p$-wave superconductor could originate from the induction of a subdominant order parameter close to the VCs.

Title: Energetics and dynamics of membrane necks in particle wrapping
Authors: Florent Fessler, Pierre Muller, Antonio Stocco
Abstract: Transport of microscopic objects across biological membranes usually involves membrane deformation to enclose the object followed by detachment of the engulfed particle. However, in artificial membranes, this last topological remodelling step is in many cases not spontaneous due to the elastic stability of the neck structure formed upon complete particle wrapping. In this work, we use optical trapping to induce the wrapping of a non-adhesive microsphere by the membrane of a giant lipid vesicle and investigate the energetics and dynamics of the resulting neck structure. We find that neck formation occurs as a result of membrane shape energy minimization under the application of external force. Remarkably, increasing membrane tension could reopen the neck and reverse the wrapping process. This process shows a clear hysteresis and a degree of reversibility. Neck cleavage and particle detachment into the vesicle's interior could not be triggered in the range of our optical forces. Systematic studies on the thermal dynamics of wrapped particles allowed to establish that diffusion properties of the system are in agreement with a coupling of the particle motion with the neck structure, modeled as a solid inclusion within the membrane. Interestingly, the wrapped particle dynamics exhibited a tension dependency, which can be described as the sum of several drag contributions.

Title: Selective Oxidation and Cr Segregation in High-Entropy Oxide Thin Films
Authors: Le Wang, Krishna Prasad Koirala, Shuhang Wu, Jueli Shi, Hsin-Mei Kao, Andrew Ho, Min-Ju Choi, Dongchen Qi, Anton Tadich, Mark E. Bowden, Bethany E. Matthews, Hua Zhou, Yang Yang, Chih-hung Chang, Zihua Zhu, Chongmin Wang, Yingge Du
Abstract: High-entropy oxides (HEOs) offer exceptional compositional flexibility and structural stability, making them promising materials for energy and catalytic applications. Here, we investigate Sr doping effects on B-site cation oxidation states, local composition, and structure in epitaxial La1-xSrx(Cr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2)O3 thin films. X-ray spectroscopies reveal that Sr doping preferentially promotes Cr oxidation from Cr3+ to Cr6+, partially oxidizes Co and Ni, while leaving Mn4+ and Fe3+ unchanged. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy shows pronounced Cr segregation, with Cr exhibiting depletion at the film-substrate interface and enrichment at the film surface, along with the formation of a partially amorphous phase in heavily Sr-doped samples. This segregation is likely driven by oxidation-induced migration of smaller, high-valence Cr cations during the growth. These findings underscore the critical interplay between charge transfer, local strain, and compositional fluctuations, providing strategies to control surface composition and electronic structure in HEOs for more robust electrocatalyst design.

Title: A method for determining the Zeeman splitting of a spin qubit via Rabi-driven tunneling
Authors: Emily Townsend, Joshua Pomeroy, Garnett W. Bryant
Abstract: We show that resonant driving between the spin up and spin down states of an electron spin-qubit in a quantum dot reduces the occupancy of the dot through leakage to an appropriately tuned lead. A nearby charge sensor measuring the occupancy of the dot should be able to detect the narrow resonant condition upon sweeping the driving frequency. The presence of interactions with noisy and thermal environments such as leads are an inherent part of creating and manipulating quantum information processing systems. This work is an example of how to incorporate methods from the ``open quantum systems'' perspective into descriptions of quantum devices. The method used here captures the coherent dynamics of the Rabi driving on the spin state of an electron tunneling into a lead, and yields full equations of motion for the interaction-picture density matrix with on- or off-resonance driving

Title: Phase-Field Model of Solution and Stoichiometric Phases with Molar Volume Difference
Authors: Chengyin Wu, Yanzhou Ji
Abstract: Phase-field models have proven indispensable for deciphering the microstructure complexities inherent in multicomponent systems. The confluence of varying phase molar volumes presents unique challenges. Understanding the impact of molar volume differences on multiphase systems is of crucial significance, as it directly influences the system's thermodynamic and kinetic behavior, as well as resulting phase morphologies and distributions. In this study, we developed a phase-field model of solution and stoichiometric phases that can account for the molar volume differences. With the phase molar volumes taken from existing CALPHAD thermodynamic databases, we quantitatively investigated how the different molar volume settings would influence the growth rate and morphologies of stoichiometric $\theta^\prime$-\ce{Al2Cu} and $\beta$-\ce{Al140Mg89} precipitates in Al-based alloys. We anticipate that this approach can be applied to various materials systems with phase- and composition-dependent molar volumes for more accurate phase-field predictions.

Title: Spall failure of alumina at high-strain rates using femtosecond laser experiments and high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations
Authors: Mewael Isiet, Musanna Galib, Yunhuan Xiao, Jerry I. Dadap, Zliliang Ye, Mauricio Ponga
Abstract: Ceramic materials are widely used in high-strain-rate applications due to their exceptional strength-to-weight ratio. However, under these extreme conditions, spall failure becomes a critical concern, which is driven by a large hydrostatic tensile stress state. This study introduces a novel two-laser setup to generate controlled hydrostatic stress states at specific locations within test specimens. By inducing and manipulating shock wave interactions, we achieve large hydrostatic compressive and tensile stresses at very high-strain-rates, enabling the controlled nucleation and growth of nanovoids leading to spall failure. Our experiments demonstrate that shock wave interference can precisely trigger spallation at arbitrary locations in the specimen thickness. To further validate our approach, we investigate alumina spall failure using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a custom-designed graph neural network potential. The MD results show strong agreement with experimentally estimated spall strength. These findings highlight the potential of the two-laser technique as a powerful tool for studying the early stages of spall failure in ceramics, paving the way for advanced materials testing methodologies.

Title: Lanczos-Pascal approach to correlation functions in chaotic quantum systems
Authors: Merlin Füllgraf, Jiaozi Wang, Jochen Gemmer
Abstract: Equilibration is a ubiquitous phenomenon in chaotic quantum systems. Given the variety and multitude of condensed matter-type chaotic quantum systems, it may be considered as surprising how simple dynamics often are on the level of few body observables. In the context of this paper simple implies "in good agreement with a superpostion of only a few exponentially damped oscillations". We follow the (possibly somewhat odd) idea that it may be precisely the complexity of chaotic systems that entails the simpleness of their dynamics. We do so employing the framework of the recently resurged recursion method comprising Lanczos coefficients to generate the dynamics. We find that the structure of the Lanczos coefficients that enables simpleness is in accord with the operator growth hypothesis. We present a method to explicitly construct approximations to the dynamics from the Lanczos coefficients. These approximations result as simple for various chaotic spin systems. While the consideration applies to systems in the thermodynamic limit, we compare our approximations to state-of-the-art numerics for large but finite quantum systems and obtain good agreement.

Title: Long-range magnetic perturbations at Bi2Te3/Cr2Te3 interfaces induced by chemical diffusion and proximity effects
Authors: Markel Pardo-Almanza, Yuita Fujisawa, Takatsugu Onishi, Chia Hsiu Hsu, Alec P. LaGrow, Yoshinori Okada
Abstract: The heterointerface between topological insulators and magnetic materials provides a crucial platform for investigating exotic electronic and magnetic phases, with implications for both fundamental studies and potential applications. A key challenge is determining the spatial extent of magnetic perturbation across the interface. In this study, we grew Bi2Te3 films with mixed thicknesses of 5 and 6 quintuple layers (QLs) on a thick ferromagnetic Cr2Te3 film. Chemical analysis indicates gradual Cr diffusion across the interface into Bi2Te3, reaching up to the 4th QL, while the 5th and 6th QL remain free of Cr. Despite the absence of direct Cr incorporation, quasiparticle interference imaging using spectroscopic scanning tunneling microscopy reveals strong backscattering on the 5th QL surface. This suggests an intrinsic magnetic proximity effect, which breaks time-reversal symmetry without magnetic doping, extending into the 5th QLs. Although variations may exist across different systems, the large magnetic perturbation length scale observed here is a valuable guiding principle for engineering exotic electronic and magnetic states at heterointerfaces between topological insulators and magnetic materials.

Title: Broad-based experimental evidence for a hidden phase of cuprate coexistence with far-reaching implications
Authors: K.E. Gray
Abstract: Analyses of experimental data in the literature show thresholds that directly imply a coexistent superconductive (SC) and pseudogap (PG) phase that, to our knowledge, has not been previously identified. The data used emphasize the essences of d-wave cuprate SC, i.e., the superfluid density and the momentum dependence. For severe underdoping, these data imply that SC condenses conventionally onto the unaltered low-energy density-of-states of a high-temperature PG. Beyond a doping threshold, the high-temperature normal state is replaced, below the SC transition temperature, by a single energetically-favorable thermodynamic phase that embodies a more complex interplay of these orders. This previously hidden phase occupies a central portion of the SC dome, enhances the superfluid density by a factor of two or more to benefit applications, can resolve thirteen mysteries in the literature and suggests an alternative approach to cuprate SC.

Title: Individual and cooperative superexchange enhancement in cuprates
Authors: Tonghuan Jiang, Nikolay A. Bogdanov, Ali Alavi, Ji Chen
Abstract: It is now widely accepted that the antiferromagnetic coupling within high temperature superconductors strongly exhibits a profound correlation with the upper limit of superconducting transition temperature these materials can reach. Thus, accurately calculating the positive and negative mechanisms that influence magnetic coupling in specific materials is crucial for the exploration of superconductivity at higher temperatures. Nevertheless, it is notoriously difficult to establish a complete description of electron correlations employing ab initio theories because of the large number of orbitals involved. In this study, we tackle the challenge of achieving high-level ab initio wave function theory calculations, which allow an explicit treatment of electron correlations associated with a large number of high-energy orbitals. We elucidate the atomic-shell-wise contributions to the superexchange coupling in the lanthanum cuprate, including individual effects of high-energy orbitals (Cu 4d, 5d, 4f, 5p) and cooperative effects between the core and these high-energy orbitals. Specifically, the prominent contributions from Cu 4d, 5d, 4f and 5p give rise to a rich collection of previously unexamined superexchange channels. We propose a p-d-f model to universally account for the contributions of high-energy orbitals at copper sites. Our calculations and physical rationalizations offer a more robust theoretical foundation for investigating cuprate-type high-temperature superconductors.

Title: Phonon-mediated relaxation in nanomaterials from combining Density Functional Theory based non-adiabatic molecular dynamics with Kadanoff-Baym-Keldysh technique
Authors: Hadassah Griffin, Andrei Kryjevski
Abstract: Boltzmann transport equation (BE) is a potent approach to dynamics of a photoexcited (nano)material. BE collision integrals for different relaxation channels can be systematically computed using the Kadanoff-Baym-Keldysh (KBK) formalism (also called NEGF) utilizing the Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulation output. However, accurate description of phonon-mediated relaxation in a general class of (nano)materials that includes exciton effects is still an outstanding problem. The approach proposed here is based on the observation that the non-adiabatic couplings of the DFT-based non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) play the role of a time-dependent external potential coupled to the electrons. This allows application of the Keldysh approach resulting in the exciton-phonon BE collision integral, which incorporates exciton wave functions and energies obtained from Bethe-Salpeter equation. As an application, we augment BE with radiative recombination and photon-mediated exciton-exciton transition terms and then use it to calculate photoluminescence (PL) spectrum for several 1.5-$nm$ semiconductor chalcogenide nanocrystals, such as $Cd_{37}Pb_{31}Se_{68},~Cd_{31}Pb_{37}Se_{68},$ which are Janus-type, and for $Pb_{68}Se_{68}.$

Title: Flocking Beyond One Species: Novel Phase Coexistence in a Generalized Two-Species Vicsek Model
Authors: Eloise Lardet, Letian Chen, Thibault Bertrand
Abstract: A hallmark in natural systems, self-organization often stems from very simple interaction rules between individual agents. While single-species self-propelled particle (SPP) systems are well understood, the behavior of binary mixtures with general alignment interactions remains largely unexplored with few scattered results hinting at the existence of a rich emergent phase behavior. Here, we investigate systematically a generalization of the two-species Vicsek model with reciprocal intra- and interspecies (anti)alignment couplings, uncovering a rich phenomenology of emergent states. Notably, we show that rather than destroying polar order, anti-aligning interactions can promote phase separation and the emergence of global polar order. In doing so, we uncover a novel phase separation mechanism. We further find these coexistence patterns can be generalized to multi-species systems with cyclic alignment interactions.

Title: Electron transport in disordered insulating lattice under nonlinear electric field
Authors: Kunal Mozumdar, Herbert F. Fotso, Jong E. Han
Abstract: Transport in disordered systems often occurs via the variable range hopping (VRH) in the dilute carrier density limit, where electrons hop between randomly distributed localized levels. We study the nonequilibrium transport by a uniform DC electric field on a one-dimensional insulating tight-binding chain with the on-site disorder, using a finite-lattice calculation and the coherent potential approximation. We develop a theory of electric-field-assisted variable range hopping as a mechanism for nonlinear transport in a disordered chain. Our finite-lattice calculations of the electron propagation distance and the electron mobility determine the range of the variable range hopping as $\Delta < W \lesssim 2\Delta$ in the gap $\Delta$. We further propose a nonlinear scaling of the conductivity by an electric field that is similar to Mott's variable range hopping in equilibrium. The nonlinear conductivity of an electronic lattice model follows the scaling law $\sigma(E) \propto \exp[-(E_0/E)^{\nu}]$ with the exponent $\nu = 1/3$ in one dimension for the VRH. We also discuss the experimental relevance of temperature-dependent nonlinear current-voltage relation.

Title: Moiré Superradiance in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with Quantum Atom Gas
Authors: Lu Zhou, Zheng-Chun Li, Keye Zhang, Zhihao Lan, Alessio Celi, Weiping Zhang
Abstract: As a novel platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, the moiré lattice has garnered significant interest in solid-state physics, photonics, and cold atom physics. While moiré lattices in two- and three-dimensional systems have been proposed for neutral cold atoms, the simpler one-dimensional moiré effect remains largely unexplored. We present a scheme demonstrating moiré effects in a one-dimensional cold atom-cavity coupling system, which resembles a generalized open Dicke model exhibiting superradiant phase transitions. We reveal a strong link between the phase transition critical point and the one-dimensional moiré parameter. Additionally, we derive the cavity field spectrum, connected to the dynamical structure factor, and showcase controlled atomic diffusion. This work provides a new route for testing one-dimensional moiré effects with cold atoms and open new possibility of moiré metrology.

Title: Exchangeless braiding of Majorana zero modes in weakly coupled Kitaev chains
Authors: Robin Quade, Michael Potthoff
Abstract: Exchangeless braiding of Majorana modes is studied in minimal networks of weakly hybridized Kitaev chains of finite length using a rigorous many-body framework. In particular, for two coupled chains it is shown that exchangeless braiding is achieved by $2\pi$ rotations of the phase $\phi$ of the superconducting order parameter of one of the chains. This braiding protocol is verified by the numerical calculation of the non-Abelian Wilczek-Zee phase of the low-energy many-body subspaces $\ca H_{0}(\phi)$ based on the Bertsch-Robledo ground-state overlap formula. In the parameter space spanned by the total chain length, the strength of the weak hybridization connecting the chains, and the on-site potential, we identify two regions with different braiding outcomes, i.e., a projective $\sigma_{x}$-gate and a projective $\sigma_{z}$-gate phase. The transition between these phases is a continuous crossover, the location of which is reliably given by a simple four-Majorana mode model. This demonstrates the resilience of the anyonic properties of the Majorana modes against finite-size effects and weak links between Kitaev chains.

Title: Anisotropic superconductivity in the quasi-one-dimensional superconductor V$_2$Ga$_5$
Authors: G. Lamura, D. Tay, R. Khasanov, P. Gentile, C. Q. Xu, X. Ke, I. J. Onuorah, P. Bonfà, Xiaofeng Xu, T. Shiroka
Abstract: The intermetallic quasi-one-dimensional binary superconductor V$_2$Ga$_5$ was recently found to exhibit a topologically nontrivial normal state, making it a natural candidate for a topological superconductor (TSC). By combining dc-magnetization, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon-spin rotation ({$\mu$SR) measurements on high-quality V$_2$Ga$_5$ single crystals, we investigate the electronic properties of its normal- and superconducting (SC) ground states. NMR measurements in the normal state indicate a strong anisotropy in both the line shifts and the relaxation rates. Such anisotropy persists also in the superconducting state, as shown by the magnetization- and $\mu$SR-spectroscopy results. In the latter case, data collected at different temperatures, pressures, and directions of the magnetic field evidence a fully-gapped, strongly anisotropic superconductivity. At the same time, hydrostatic pressure is shown to only lower the $T_c$ value, but not to change the superfluid density nor its temperature dependence. Lastly, we discuss the search for topological signatures in the normal state of V$_2$Ga$_5$, as well as a peak splitting in the FFT of the $\mu$SR spectrum, possibly related to an unconventional vortex lattice. Our results suggest that V$_2$Ga$_5$ is a novel system, whose anisotropy plays a key role in determining its unusual electronic properties.

Title: Klein Tunneling in Uniaxial Strained Graphene under Super-Periodic Potential
Authors: Sudhanshu Shekhar, Bhabani Prasad Mandal, Anirban Dutta
Abstract: In this article, we employ the transfer matrix method (TMM) to analytically explore the impact of uniaxial strain on electron scattering in graphene under locally periodic and super-periodic electrostatic potential. Our study reveals that strain significantly influences electron transmission through the merging parameter $(\delta)$, which modulates the Dirac cone positions. a positive merging parameter ($\delta > 0$) reduces the transmission probability by opening an energy gap at the merging point, while a negative merging parameter ($\delta < 0$) enhances transmission by bringing the Dirac cones closer, facilitating electron transport at certain angles. However, the resonance peaks in super-periodic potential (SPP) are sharper for $\delta < 0$, making them more pronounced but increasingly difficult to resolve as the number of barriers increases.

Title: Optical signatures of noncentrosymmetric structural distortion in altermagnetic MnTe
Authors: Ao Wu, Di Cheng, Xinyun Wang, Meng Zeng, Chang Liu, Xinwei Li
Abstract: The hexagonal MnTe is a prime material candidate for altermagnets, an emerging class of magnetic compounds characterized by the nontrivial interplay of antiparallel spin arrangements with their underlying crystal structures. Recognizing precise knowledge of crystal symmetry as the cornerstone of the spin-group classification scheme, we report here a native inversion-symmetry-breaking structural distortion in this compound that has previously been overlooked. Through optical polarimetry experiments and first-principle calculations, we show that MnTe belongs to the noncentrosymmetric $D_{3h}$ group, effectively resolving key inconsistencies in the earlier interpretations of Raman spectroscopy data. Our finding impacts the symmetry analysis of MnTe within the altermagnetic class and sheds light on the mechanism of its magneto-controllable Néel order.

Title: Imaging Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2

Abstract: Although no known material definitely exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, where a spin-triplet electron pairing potential $\Delta(k)$ has odd parity, UTe2 is now the leading candidate. Ideally, the parity of $\Delta(k)$ might be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging, a recognized technique for $\Delta(k)$ determination in complex superconductors. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) on crystal termination surfaces only for energies within the superconductive energy gap. The QPI should then be dominated by the QSB electronic structure and only reveal bulk $\Delta(k)$ characteristics excursively. Here, by using a superconducting scan-tip to achieve $\sim$ 10 $\mu$eV energy resolution QPI for UTe2 studies, we discover and visualize the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of its QSB. QPI visualization then yields a characteristic sextet $q_{i}:i$ = 1-6 of interference wavevectors from which we establish QSB dispersions, and their existence only for energies $|E| \leq \Delta_{\text{max}}$ within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface. Quantitative evaluation of this sextet $q_{i}$ then demonstrates precisely how the QSB is projected from the subtending bulk Fermi surface. Finally, a novel theoretical framework has been developed to predict the QPI signatures of a topological QSB at this (0-11) surface. Its predictions are demonstrably consistent with the experimental results if the bulk $\Delta(k)$ exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry. Ultimately, these new techniques adumbrate a novel spectroscopic approach to identification of intrinsic topological superconductors and their superconductive topological surface states.

Title: Quasiparticle interference and spectral function of the UTe$_2$ superconductive surface band
Authors: Adeline Crépieux, Emile Pangburn, Shuqiu Wang, Kuanysh Zhussupbekov, Joseph P. Carroll, Bin Hu, Qiangqiang Gu, J.C.Séamus Davis, Catherine Pépin, Cristina Bena
Abstract: We compute the (0-11) surface spectral function, the surface density of states (DOS), and the quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns, both in the normal state and superconducting (SC) state of UTe$_2$. We consider all possible non-chiral and chiral order parameters (OPs) that could in principle describe the superconductivity in this compound. We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.

Title: Unit-density SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard Model with Spin Flavor Imbalance
Authors: Zewen Zhang, Qinyuan Zheng, Eduardo Ibarra-Garcia-Padilla, Richard T. Scalettar, Kaden R. A. Hazzard
Abstract: The advent of ultracold alkaline-earth atoms in optical lattices has established a platform for investigating correlated quantum matter with SU($N$) symmetry, offering highly tunable model parameters that allow experiments to access phenomena that are unavailable in conventional materials. Understanding the ground-state physics of SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard models away from the Heisenberg limit and from the spin-flavor balanced setting is important, as examining the flavor imbalance reveals new physics in Fermi-Hubbard models and shows how SU($N$) phases react to practical experimental imperfections in optical lattices. In this study, mean-field phase diagrams are presented for the unit-density SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model at two sets of flavor densities, $\left(\tfrac{1}{3}-\delta,\tfrac{1}{3}+\delta,\tfrac{1}{3}\right)$ and $\left(\tfrac{1}{4}-\delta,\tfrac{1}{4}+\delta,\tfrac{1}{2}\right)$, with the flavor imbalance introduced as $\delta$. Novel phases are identified at moderate interaction strengths for both densities and their robustness is investigated in the presence of flavor imbalance. Furthermore, we provide microscopic explanations of the phases found and their stability. Analysis of thermal ensembles of random mean-field solutions indicate that, at temperatures accessible in state-of-the-art cold atom experiments, some spin orders are hard for conventional scattering or local observable measurements to detect, but can be more accessible with quantum gas microscopy in optical lattice experiments. This work also shows that nesting and Mottness, intertwined in the usual SU(2) Hubbard model in stark contrast to generic materials, can be tuned in the SU(3) model and play distinct roles. The resulting phase diagrams not only deepen our understanding of SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard models but also inform future experimental search for new phases.

Title: Enhanced Crystallization and Evaporation Retardation in Mixed Surfactant Systems at the Air-Water Interface: A Study on Chain Length Compatibility and Molecular Ratio
Authors: Kulsuma Begum, Abhijeet Das, Dinesh O. Shah, Sanjeev Kumar
Abstract: Effects of chain length compatibility and molecular ratio on the two-dimensional crystallization of a binary mixed surfactant system with non-identical molecular size and its consequence on retardation to water evaporation are described via Langmuir Blodgett films. The mixed monolayers corresponding to 1:3 exhibit minimal area per molecule owing to identical chain length. The maximum crystallization was also observed at this ratio from BAM images at constant surface pressure. The prominent changes in the physical properties of the analyzed system, for the 1:3 molecular ratio, are attributed to the augmented stability mediated by the hexagonal closed packing and packing behavior in the mixed monolayer. The observation was validated from a random ball mixing model and simulation study. The maximum retardation to evaporation was also observed for the 1:3 molecular ratio and is attributed to augmented stability and spreading of the monolayers at the air-water interface.

Title: Bose-Einstein condensation on axially-symmetric surfaces
Authors: A. Tononi, G. E. Astrakharchik
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation in ideal bosonic gases confined to axially-symmetric surfaces of revolution, focusing on ellipsoidal and toroidal geometries. By formulating the single-particle Schrödinger equation for a general surface of revolution, we derive the corresponding energy spectra and analyze the impact of curvature on the quantum statistical properties of the system. Our results demonstrate that the geometric constraints imposed by these curved manifolds modify the energy spectrum and affect the critical condensation temperature. Specifically, we show that in ellipsoidal and toroidal manifolds, the critical temperature is suppressed as their aspect ratio is increased and, correspondingly, they become highly elongated and acquire a one-dimensional character. Additionally, we evaluate the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum, providing insights into the collective excitations of the condensate. Our results establish the conditions required to achieve quantum degeneracy in curved manifolds, thus guiding forthcoming experiments and setting the basis for solving the few-to-many body problem in general surfaces of revolution.

Title: Accelerating and enhancing thermodynamic simulations of electrochemical interfaces
Authors: Xiaochen Du, Mengren Liu, Jiayu Peng, Hoje Chun, Alexander Hoffman, Bilge Yildiz, Lin Li, Martin Z. Bazant, Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli
Abstract: Electrochemical interfaces are crucial in catalysis, energy storage, and corrosion, where their stability and reactivity depend on complex interactions between the electrode, adsorbates, and electrolyte. Predicting stable surface structures remains challenging, as traditional surface Pourbaix diagrams tend to either rely on expert knowledge or costly $\textit{ab initio}$ sampling, and neglect thermodynamic equilibration with the environment. Machine learning (ML) potentials can accelerate static modeling but often overlook dynamic surface transformations. Here, we extend the Virtual Surface Site Relaxation-Monte Carlo (VSSR-MC) method to autonomously sample surface reconstructions modeled under aqueous electrochemical conditions. Through fine-tuning foundational ML force fields, we accurately and efficiently predict surface energetics, recovering known Pt(111) phases and revealing new LaMnO$_\mathrm{3}$(001) surface reconstructions. By explicitly accounting for bulk-electrolyte equilibria, our framework enhances electrochemical stability predictions, offering a scalable approach to understanding and designing materials for electrochemical applications.

Title: Heavy fermions, mass renormalization and local moments in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene via planar tunneling spectroscopy
Authors: Zhenyuan Zhang, Shuang Wu, Dumitru Călugăru, Haoyu Hu, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Wanatabe, Andrei B. Bernevig, Eva Y. Andrei
Abstract: Topological heavy fermion models[1-5] describe the flat bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) as arising from the hybridization between localized flat-band orbitals (f-electrons) and nearly-free conduction bands (c-electrons). The interplay between these f-electrons and c-electrons is theorized to give rise to emergent phenomena, including unconventional superconductivity[6-8], non-Fermi liquid behavior[9-11], and topologically nontrivial phases[12-14]. However, the fundamental properties of f- and c-electrons, such as their respective heavy and light effective mass and their properties under strain, need experimental verification. Here we report on the electronic inverse compressibility, effective mass, and entropy of MATBG, obtained from planar tunneling spectroscopy. Our results include the observation of electron mass renormalization, found to be consistent with the topological heavy fermion model prediction of heavy charge-one excitations away from integer fillings. Importantly, we present entropic evidence for 4-fold and 8-fold degenerate isospin local moment states emerging at temperatures of 10K and 20K, respectively, consistent with the entropy of 8 heavy-fermions flavors energetically split by the sample strain.

Title: Orientation-Dependent \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Heterojunction Diode with Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) Grown NiO
Authors: Yizheng Liu, Shane M.W. Witsell, John F. Conley, Sriram Krishnamoorthy
Abstract: This work reports the demonstration of ALD-deposited NiO/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs) on low doped drift layer and highly doped (001) & (100) n+ substrates with experimental observation of a parallel-plane junction electric field as high as 7.5 MV/cm, revealing a crystal orientation dependence in \b{eta}-Ga2O3. We use a novel metalorganic precursor bis(1,4-di-tert-butyl-1,3-diazadienyl) (nickel Ni(tBu2DAD)2) with ozone (O3) to deposit NiO. The NiO/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJD on 7.7 {\mu}m-thick HVPE-grown drift region exhibited an on-state current density of ~20 A/cm2 at 5 V, ~10-8 A/cm2 reverse leakage at low reverse bias(-5 V), and a rectifying ratio(Jon/Joff) of ~109. The HJD broke down at ~2.2 kV reverse bias, corresponding to a ~3.4 MV/cm parallel-plane junction electric field, with a noise floor reverse leakage (10-8~10-6 A/cm2, nA) at 80% of the device catastrophic breakdown voltage. The NiO/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs on n+ (001) & (100) highly-doped substrates exhibited breakdown voltages at 12.5-16.0 V and 28.5-70.5 V, respectively, with extracted critical electric field (EC) at 2.30-2.76 MV/cm, and 4.33-7.50 MV/cm, revealing a substrate crystal orientation dependence on breakdown electric field for \b{eta}-Ga2O3. The 7.5 MV/cm EC reported here is one of the highest parallel-plane junction electric fields reported in literature.

Title: Matrix approach to generalized ensemble theory
Authors: Shaohua Guan
Abstract: We provide a concise framework for generalized ensemble theory through a matrix-based approach. By introducing an observation matrix, any discrete probability distribution, including those for non-equilibrium steady states, can be expressed as a generalized Boltzmann distribution, with observables and conjugate variables as the basis and coordinates in a linear space. In this framework, we identify the minimal sufficient statistics required for inferring the Boltzmann distribution. Furthermore, we show that the Hadamard and Vandermonde matrices are suitable observation matrices for spin systems and random walks. In master equation systems, the probability flux observation matrix facilitates the identification of detailed balance violations. Our findings provide a new approach to developing generalized ensemble theory for non-equilibrium steady-state systems.

Title: Strain manipulation of charge density wave and Mott-insulating states in monolayer VTe2
Authors: W. Q. Tu, R. Lv, D. F. Shao, Y. P. Sun, W. J. Lu
Abstract: Monolayer vanadium ditelluride (VTe2) has recently been shown to host a Mott-insulating state that is intertwined with a 2{\sqrt{3}}*2{\sqrt{3}} charge density wave (CDW) order. However, the physical mechanisms driving the emergence of CDW order and its relationship with the Mott-insulating state are still not well understood. Unveiling the underlying physical mechanisms and exploring effective methods to modulate both CDW order and Mott-insulating state in monolayer VTe2 is therefore important. In this study, we systematically investigate the electronic band structure, phonon dispersion, and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) of monolayer VTe2 under the influence of biaxial strain. Our results reveal that the formation of CDW orders primarily arises from strong EPC effects. The narrowing of the bandwidth due to the CDW order, combined with the correlation effect of the V-3d orbital, collectively drives the system into a Mott-insulating state. Furthermore, we find that compressive strain significantly enhances the CDW order, while tensile strain suppresses it. Notably, beyond a threshold of {\epsilon} = 2% tensile strain, the CDW instability is entirely suppressed, paving the way for the emergence of a superconducting state. Our results establish that the CDW, Mott, and superconducting states in monolayer VTe2 can be effectively modulated through strain engineering, thereby advancing the understanding of the complex interplay between these correlated quantum states in VTe2.

Title: Strain-induced non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect
Authors: Wancheng Zhang, Mingkun Zheng, Yong Liu, Rui Xiong, Zhenhua Zhang, Zhihong Lu
Abstract: Recently, the large time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) spin current generated by the non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) has demonstrated significant potential for spintronic applications, with both computational and experimental validations. However, considering the broad application prospects and the scarcity of conductive altermagnetic materials, the development of novel reliable methods for inducing altermagnetism is necessary. Here, strain engineering is proposed as a simple yet effective approach. This work focuses on $\mathrm{OsO}_2$--the $5d$ counterpart of $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ sharing the rutile structure--employing \textit{ab initio} calculations to systematically investigate strain effects on its ASSE. We find that applying a small equibiaxial tensile strain $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ to $\mathrm{OsO}_2$ can induce a transition from non-magnetic to altermagnetic states. Only $3\%$ $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ is required to achieve a spin-charge conversion ratio ($\theta_{\text{AS}}$) of $\sim7\%$ for the $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin current generated by ASSE, far exceeding the intrinsic spin Hall angle $\theta_{\text{IS}}$ produced by the conventional spin Hall effect (CSHE). Calculations reveal that substantial $\theta_{\text{AS}}$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to non-relativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirming the strain-induced ASSE's non-relativistic origin. Further calculations reveal that $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties. Our research opens new simple pathways for developing next-generation altermagnetic spintronic devices.

Title: Hybridization of colloidal handlebodies with singular defects and topological solitons in chiral liquid crystals
Authors: Jun-Yong Lee, Asha Kumari, Ye Yuan, Mykola Tasinkevych, Ivan I. Smalyukh
Abstract: Topology can manifest itself in colloids when quantified by invariants like Euler characteristics of nonzero-genus colloidal surfaces, albeit spherical colloidal particles are most often studied, and colloidal particles with complex topology are rarely considered. On the other hand, singular defects and topological solitons often define the physical behavior of the molecular alignment director fields in liquid crystals. Interestingly, nematic liquid crystalline dispersions of colloidal particles allow for probing the interplay between topologies of surfaces and fields, but only a limited number of such cases have been explored so far. Here, we study the hybridization of topological solitons, singular defects, and topologically nontrivial colloidal particles with the genus of surfaces different from zero in a chiral nematic liquid crystal phase. Hybridization occurs when distortions separately induced by colloidal particles and LC solitons overlap, leading to energy minimization-driven redistribution of director field deformations and defects. As a result, hybrid director configurations emerge, combining topological features from both components. We uncover a host of director field configurations complying with topological theorems, which can be controlled by applying electric fields. Rotational and translational dynamics arise due to the nonreciprocal evolution of the director fields in response to alternating electric fields of different frequencies. These findings help define a platform for controlling topologically hyper-complex colloidal structures and dynamics with electrically reconfigurable singular defects and topological solitons induced by colloidal handlebodies.

Title: Deep Learning Assisted Denoising of Experimental Micrographs
Authors: Owais Ahmad, Albert Linda, Saumya Ranjan Jha, Somanth Bhowmick
Abstract: Microstructure imaging is crucial in materials science, but experimental images often introduce noise that obscures critical structural details. This study presents a novel deep learning approach for robust microstructure image denoising, combining phase-field simulations, Fourier transform techniques, and an attention-based neural network. The innovative framework addresses dataset limitations by synthetically generating training data by combining computational phase-field microstructures with experimental optical micrographs. The neural network architecture features an attention mechanism that dynamically focuses on important microstructural features while systematically eliminating noise types like scratches and surface imperfections. Testing on a FeMnNi alloy system demonstrated the model's exceptional performance across multiple magnifications. By successfully removing diverse noise patterns while maintaining grain boundary integrity, the research provides a generalizable deep-learning framework for microstructure image enhancement with broad applicability in materials science.

Abstract: Van der Waals materials enable the construction of atomically sharp interfaces between compounds with distinct crystal and electronic properties. This is dramatically exploited in moiré systems, where a lattice mismatch or twist between monolayers generates an emergent in-plane periodicity, giving rise to electronic properties absent in the constituent materials. In contrast, vertical superlattices-formed by stacking dissimilar van der Waals materials in the out-of-plane direction on the nanometer scale-remain largely unexplored, despite their potential to realize analogous emergent phenomena in three dimensions. Here, we employ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory to investigate six-to-eight layer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures. We find that even a single superlattice unit, i.e. a pair of stacked few-layer materials, exhibits emergent bands that closely resemble the hallmark three-dimensional electronic structure of many-layer TMDs, while simultaneously exhibiting an orbital- and momentum-dependent delocalization through the entire heterostructure due to its asymmetric architecture. We demonstrate how non-trivial band topology and unique TMD fermiologies are readily stabilized through these mechanisms, thus providing direct evidence for the novel electronic states possible through vertical superlattice engineering. These findings establish asymmetric heterostructures as platforms to invoke and control unprecedented combinations of the diverse quantum phases native to many-layer TMDs.

Abstract: Due to the dominant Kitaev exchange interactions, the cobaltate, Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_{6}$, has been considered to be approximate to the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL). Here, we investigate both magnetic dilution and chemical pressure effects of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_{6}$ by the substitutions of Mg$^{2+}$ for Co$^{2+}$ through the structural, optical, magnetic and thermodynamic measurements. No structural transition has been observed, and the bandgaps remain constant in all doping levels. Combining with the magnetic and thermodynamic measurements, we find that the antiferromagnetic transition temperature is continuously suppressed with increasing Mg doping levels and completely disappears at $x=0.2$. Interestingly, when the doping level $x$ is larger than 0.2, neither long-range magnetic order nor spin glass state has been detected, and the specific heat has a residual linear term at zero field. All features indicate that Na$_{3}$(Co$_{2-x}$Mg$_{x}$)SbO$_{6}$ system enters into a novel spin disorder (NSD) state.

Title: High-Efficiency Electrically Switchable Nonvolatile Thermal Transistor with Multiple Thermal Conductivity States Based on Ferroelectric HfO2
Authors: Yong-Kun Huo, Hui-Feng Feng, Chao Yao, Zhong-Xiao Song, Zhi-Xin Guo
Abstract: While nanoscale electronic logic circuits are well-established, the development of na-noscale thermal logic circuits has been slow, mainly due to the absence of efficient and controllable nonvolatile field-effect thermal transistors. In this study, we introduce a novel approach that leverages ferroelectric orthorhombic hafnium dioxide (o-HfO2) thin films to achieve electrically switchable nonvolatile field-effect thermal transistors. Using molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning potentials, we demonstrate that a 24 nm o-HfO2 film can exhibit four distinct, reversible states of thermal conductivity. Notably, these states achieve a maximum switching ratio of 171% under 2% tensile strain. Our results underscore the potential of ferroelectric materials, particularly o-HfO2, in advancing thermal logic circuits by enabling multiple, stable thermal conductivity states controlled by electric fields.

Title: Unravel the rotational and translational behavior of a single squirmer in flexible polymer solutions at different Reynolds numbers
Authors: Yuan Zhou, Kai Qi, Marco De Corato, Kevin Stratford, Ignacio Pagonabarraga
Abstract: Microorganisms thrive in complex environments and their behavior in fluids holds significant importance for various medical and industrial applications. By conducting Lattice Boltzmann simulations, the transport and rotational properties of a generic squirmer are investigated in solutions embedded with flexible polymers at different Reynolds numbers. The interplay of activity and heterogeneously distributed polymers have profound influences on these properties. Remarkable enhancements of up to three orders of magnitude in the rotational motion, along with apparent decays in self-propelling velocities, are observed for squirmers with non-zero active stresses. These extraordinary phenomena stem from the squirmer-polymer mechanical and hydrodynamic interactions. Specifically, polymer wrapping occurs in front of a pusher, while numerous polymers are absorbed in the rear of a puller. Both mechanisms enhance the rotational motion and simultaneously impede translations through forces and torques arising from direct contacts or asymmetric local flows induced by polymers. The source dipole flow fields generated by a neutral swimmer rapidly advect polymers to the rear, leaving no apparent impacts on its rotational and transport properties. The influences of Reynolds number Re and squirmer-polymer boundary conditions (no-slip and repulsive) on the dynamics are addressed. In short, the no-slip boundary condition results in more profound effects on both rotational and translational properties at Re = 0.8. However, at Re = 0.04, the disparity between the two boundary conditions diminishes due to the heightened fluid viscous drag, which impedes direct contacts between squirmers and polymers. Our results reveal the relevance of system heterogeneity and highlight the essential role of squirmer-polymer mechanical and hydrodynamic interactions in shaping the behavior of swimmers in viscoelastic fluids.

Title: Identifying Ising and percolation phase transitions based on KAN method
Authors: Dian Xu, Shanshan Wang, Wei Li, Weibing Deng, Feng Gao, Jianmin Shen
Abstract: Modern machine learning, grounded in the Universal Approximation Theorem, has achieved significant success in the study of phase transitions in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. However, identifying the critical points of percolation models using raw configurations remains a challenging and intriguing problem. This paper proposes the use of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network, which is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem, to input raw configurations into a learning model. The results demonstrate that the KAN can indeed predict the critical points of percolation models. Further observation reveals that, apart from models associated with the density of occupied points, KAN is also capable of effectively achieving phase classification for models where the sole alteration pertains to the orientation of spins, resulting in an order parameter that manifests as an external magnetic flux, such as the Ising model.

Title: Pseudo-giant number fluctuations and nematic order in microswimmer suspensions
Authors: Ismail El Korde, Dóra Bárdfalvy, Jason M. Lewis, Alexander Morozov, Cesare Nardini, Joakim Stenhammar
Abstract: Giant number fluctuations (GNFs), whereby the standard deviation $\Delta N$ in the local number of particles $\langle N \rangle$ grows faster than $\sqrt{\langle N \rangle}$, are a hallmark property of dry active matter systems with orientational order, such as a collection of granular particles on a vibrated plate. This contrasts with momentum-conserving ("wet") active matter systems, such as suspensions of swimming bacteria, where no theoretical prediction of GNFs exist, although numerous experimental observations of such enhanced fluctuations have been reported. In this Letter, we numerically confirm the emergence of super-Gaussian number fluctuations in a 3-dimensional suspension of pusher microswimmers undergoing a transition to collective motion. These fluctuations emerge sharply above the transition, but only for sufficiently large values of the bacterial persistence length $\ell_p = v_s / \lambda$, where $v_s$ is the bacterial swimming speed and $\lambda$ the tumbling rate. Crucially, these "pseudo-GNFs" differ from true GNFs, as they only occur on length scales shorter than the typical size $\xi$ of nematic patches in the collective motion state, which is in turn proportional to the single-swimmer persistence length $\ell_p$. Our results thus suggest that observations of enhanced density fluctuations in biological active matter systems actually represent transient effects that decay away beyond mesoscopic length scales, and raises the question to what extent "true" GNFs with universal properties can exist in the presence of fluid flows.

Title: Fermi-Energy-Sensitive Universal Conductance Fluctuations in Anisotropic Materials
Authors: Yang Qinag, Hu Yayun, Hou Zhe, Tong Peiqing
Abstract: Universal conductance fluctuation (UCF) is a hallmark of quantum interference in mesoscopic devices. According to the Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory, the amplitude of UCF remains independent of system parameters such as Fermi energy and disorder strength. However, recent experiments have demonstrated a significant variation in UCF with respect to Fermi energy in the anisotropic Dirac semimetal $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, suggesting a dependence on band anisotropy. In this work, we reconcile the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental observations through a detailed study of UCF versus Fermi energy using a tight-binding model with tunable anisotropy parameters. Near the band edge, the Hamiltonian is simplified to an anisotropic free electron gas model, recovering the generalized Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory. However, as the Fermi energy shifts toward the band center, where rotational symmetry breaks into $C_4$ (four-fold rotational) symmetry, the UCF amplitude deviates from the standard theory. Our findings reveal that UCF becomes increasingly sensitive to Fermi energy as the anisotropy grows stronger. Furthermore, using realistic parameters for $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, our calculations demonstrate an increase in UCF away from the Dirac point, in qualitative agreement with experimental results. The enhancement of UCF occurs in two perpendicular transport directions that we have calculated, albeit with quantitative differences in magnitude, which can be tested in future experiments. Given the prevalence of anisotropic materials and technical advances in engineering anisotropy through strain or twist, our results offer a valuable reference for characterizing intrinsic electronic properties via UCF.

Title: Critical role of the motor density and distribution on polar active polymers
Authors: Surabhi Jaiswal, Prithwiraj Maity, Snigdha Thakur, Marisol Ripoll
Abstract: Polar polymer activity is a fundamental mechanism behind a large number of cellular dynamical processes. The number and location of the active sites on the polymer backbone play a central role in their dynamics and conformational properties. Globular conformations for high motor densities change to stretched ones for the more realistic moderate or low density of motors, with a self-propelled polymer velocity non-monotonically related to the motor density. A small difference in the position of the first motor, or the motor distribution, can also dramatically modify the polymer typical conformations

Title: Adiabatic charge transport in extended SSH models
Authors: Dharana Joshi, Tanay Nag
Abstract: We explore the topological properties of extended SSH models, considering four sub-lattices in a unit cell and second-nearest-neighbor intercell hopping for SSH4 and SSH long-range (SSHLR) models, respectively. The additional tuning parameters cause the SSH4 (SSHLR) model to host chiral symmetry protected two (two and four) zero-energy modes producing a richer phase diagram that we characterize by momentum space, periodic-bulk and open-bulk real space winding numbers. We introduce time to study charge transport in the periodically driven SSH4 and SSHLR models under the adiabatic limit. We remarkably find that the whole parameter space turned topological for a certain choice of the remaining parameters leading to always finite quantized value of pumped charge at the end of a complete cycle. Considering time as another variable, we characterize these new phases of the driven models by momentum space Chern number, periodic-bulk and open-bulk real space Bott index. We also investigate the time evolution of pumped charge for these models and connect it with the intriguing windings of the mid-gap energy levels with time. Interestingly, the maximum value of Chern number or Bott index for the driven models is more than that of the winding number associated with the static model indicating the fact that there exist more zero-energy modes during the full course of a driving cycle compared to the underlying static models. We further extend our study to the quantum metric where the fluctuations in the above quantity can identify the presence of a topological phase boundary.

Title: Emergent supercounterfluid and quantum phase diagram of two-component interacting bosons in one-dimensional optical lattice
Authors: Saisai He, Yang Liu, Bin Xi, Hong-Gang Luo, Qiang Luo, Jize Zhao
Abstract: Motivated by a recent experiment that realizes nearest-neighbor dipolar couplings in an optical lattice [C. Lagoin, $\textit{et al.}$, Nature $\textbf{609}$, 485 (2022)], we study a one-dimensional version of the two-component extended Bose-Hubbard model via the density-matrix renormalization group method. By using the nearest-neighbor and on-site interaction parameters from the experiment, we start by mapping the quantum phase diagram in the hopping parameters $t_{A}\mbox{-}t_{B}$ plane with boson densities $\rho_{A}=\rho_{B}=1/2$. In addition to the density wave phase reported in the experiment, we find several regimes of superfluidity when one or two hopping parameters are large enough, and interestingly there is a supercounterfluid phase at moderate and comparable hopping parameters. The universality classes of these phase transitions are analyzed from the correlation functions, excitation gaps, and entanglement entropy. In particular, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type is recognized several gapped-to-gapless transitions. In addition, we also study the quantum phase transitions when varying $\rho_{B}$ from 0 to 1 while keeping $\rho_A = 1/2$. We identify a supersolid phase in a wide range of $1/2<\rho_B<1$. Our work paves the way for realizing exotic many-body phases in cold atom experiments upon proper tuning of experimental parameters.

Title: Predicting Mode-I/II fracture toughness and crack growth in diboride ceramics via machine-learning potentials
Authors: Shuyao Lin, Zhuo Chen, Rebecca Janknecht, Zaoli Zhang, Lars Hultman, Paul H. Mayrhofer, Nikola Koutna, Davide G. Sangiovanni
Abstract: Fracture toughness and strength are critical for structural ceramics, which are prone to brittle failure. However, accurately characterizing these properties is challenging, especially for thin films on substrates. In-situ microscopy often fails to resolve crack initiation, while fractured samples provide limited insight into fracture modes and crack paths. Here, we employ stress intensity factor ($K$) controlled atomistic simulations of fracture to characterize the crack-initiation properties of hard but brittle diboride ceramics. Our molecular statics calculations are based on moment-tensor machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained on {\it{ab initio}} information collected for a variety of atomistic environments. TMB$_{2}$ (TM$=$Ti, Zr, Hf) lattice models with six distinct atomically-sharp crack geometries subjected to Mode-I (opening) and/or Mode-II (sliding) deformation serve as platforms to illustrate the capability of the approach. The Mode-I initiation toughness $K_{Ic}$ and fracture strength $\sigma_{f}$ -- within ranges 1.8-2.9~MPa$\cdot\sqrt{m}$ and 1.6-2.4~GPa -- are extrapolated at the macroscale limit by fitting the results of finite (up to 10$^{6}$ atoms) cracked plate models with constitutive scaling relations. Our simulations show that most diboride lattice models fail by extension of the native crack. However, crack-deflection on the $(1\overline{1}01)$ plane is observed for the $(10\overline{1}0)[\overline{1}2\overline{1}0]$ crystal geometry. As exemplified by TiB$_{2}$, varying Mode-I/II loading ratios have little influence on crack propagation paths, which overall occurs by decohesion of low-energy fracture planes or combined sliding. Our predictions are supported by cube-corner nanoindentation on TiB$_{2}$ samples along the [0001] direction, revealing the same fracture plane as observed in simulations.

Title: Oscillatory instability in an Ostwald ripening process
Authors: Michael Wilkinson
Abstract: This paper considers an Ostwald ripening process in which new droplets are injected at a constant rate, with a fixed distribution of radii, and in which droplets are removed when they grow to a specified maximum radius. This process exhibits a transition from a steady state to a limit cycle as a parameter is varied. The instability is shown to be related to the roots of the Laplace transform of a response kernel. A model is described which gives a good approximation of the period of the limit cycle. The model may also exhibit chaotic behaviour. The relevance of the model to atmospheric precipitation is discussed.

Title: Review of the Electrochemical Double Layer Theory and Its Applications in Battery Electrode Materials
Authors: Yitao He
Abstract: The interface plays a critical role in electrochemical systems, driving the development of various theories to investigate properties at nanoscale and microscale levels, including the electrictrochemical double layer (EDL) theory and continuum theory. However, the application of EDL theory within the realm of battery electrode materials has not been clearly defined according to material type. The diverse range of materials and their intricate interactions with interface theories often lead to misunderstandings. This review meticulously outlines the origins and principles of the EDL theory. Additionally, it categorizes battery electrode materials into two main groups: semiconductors and conductors. A comprehensive examination is presented on the implementation of EDL and other interface theories, accompanied by a comparative evaluation of the fundamental models and experiments described. The review also explores the potential advancements of EDL and other interface theories, as well as their application in electrode materials. This exhaustive review serves as an invaluable resource for scholars in electrochemistry and materials science, aiding in their understanding of interface theories, their scope of applicability, and the integration of these theories with practical experimental approaches.

Abstract: Vibrational dynamics governs the fundamental properties of molecular crystals, shaping their thermodynamics, mechanics, spectroscopy, and transport phenomena. However desirable, the first-principles calculation of solid-state vibrations, i.e.\ phonons, stands as a major computational challenge in molecular crystals characterized by many atoms in the unit cell and by weak intermolecular interactions. Here we propose a formulation of the harmonic lattice dynamics based on a natural basis of molecular coordinates consisting of rigid-body displacements and intramolecular vibrations. This enables a sensible \emph{minimal molecular displacement} approximation for the calculation of the dynamical matrix, combining isolated molecule calculations with only a small number of expensive crystal supercell calculations, ultimately reducing the computational cost by up to a factor 10. The comparison with reference calculations demonstrates the quantitative accuracy of our method, especially for the challenging and dispersive low-frequency region it is designed for. Our method provides an excellent description of the thermodynamic properties and offers a privileged molecular-level insight into the complex phonons band structure of molecular materials.

Title: Optically tunable spin Hall effect in periodically driven monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Naoya Arakawa, Kenji Yonemitsu
Abstract: We show that the driving field of circularly polarized light (CPL) can be used to enhance and reverse the spin current generated in the spin Hall effect for some transition-metal dichalcogenides. This is demonstrated by analyzing the time-averaged spin Hall conductivities in the nonequilibrium steady states of monolayers WS$_{2}$, MoS$_{2}$, MoTe$_{2}$, and WTe$_{2}$ driven by CPL with the Floquet linear-response theory. We argue that the enhancement and reversals of the spin current come from a combination of the non-Rashba effect of broken inversion symmetry and the nonperturbative effect of CPL beyond the dynamical localization. This work allows optical control of the magnitude and direction of the pure spin current.

Title: Electric fields-tuning plasmon and coupled plasmon-phonon modes in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Chengxiang Zhao, Wenjun Zhang, Haotong Wang, Fangwei Han, and Haiming Dong
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the electric field-tuning plasmons and plasmon-phonon couplings of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as monolayer MoS2, under the consideration of spin-orbit coupling. It is revealed that the frequencies of plasmons and coupled plasmon-phonon modes originating from electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions can be effectively changed by using applied driving electric fields. Notably, these frequencies exhibit a decreasing trend with an increasing electric field. Moreover, the weak angular dependence of these modes suggests that the driving electric field does not induce significant anisotropy in the plasmon modes. The outcomes of this work demonstrate that the plasmon and coupled plasmon-phonon modes can be tuned not only by manipulating the electron density via the application of a gate voltage but also by tuning the applied driving electric field. These findings hold relevance for facilitating the application of 2D TMDs in optoelectronic devices.

Title: Topologically protected synchronization in networks
Authors: Massimo Ostilli
Abstract: In a graph, we say that two nodes are topologically equivalent if their sets of first neighbors, excluding the two nodes, coincide. We prove that nonlinearly coupled oscillators located on a group of topologically equivalent nodes can get easily synchronized when the group forms a fully connected subgraph (or combinations of these), regardless of the status of all the other oscillators. More generally, any change occurring in the inner part of the remainder of the graph will not alter the synchronization status of the group. Typically, the group can synchronize when $k^{(\mathrm{OUT})}\leq k^{(\mathrm{IN})}$, $k^{(\mathrm{IN})}$ and $k^{(\mathrm{OUT})}$ being the common internal and outgoing degree of each node in the group, respectively. Simulations confirm our analysis and suggest that groups of topologically equivalent nodes play the role of independent pacemakers.

Title: Computing ternary liquid phase diagrams: Fe-Cu-Ni
Authors: Dallas R. Trinkle (Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign)
Abstract: We compute the phase separation of the immiscible liquid alloy Fe-Cu-Ni. Our computational approach uses a virtual semigrand canonical Widom approach to determine differences in excess chemical potentials between different species. Using an embedded atom potential for Fe-Cu-Ni, we simulate liquid states over a range of compositions and temperatures. This raw data is then fit to Redlich-Kister polynomials for the Gibbs free energy with a simple temperature dependence. Using the analytic form, we can determine the phase diagram for the ternary liquid, compute the miscibility gap and spinodal decomposition as a function of temperature for this EAM potential. In addition, we compute density as a function of composition and temperature, and predict pair correlation functions. We use static structure factors to estimate the second derivative of the Gibbs free energy (the $S^0$ method) and compare with our fit Gibbs free energy. Finally, using a nonequilibrium Hamiltonian integration method, we separately compute absolute Gibbs free energies for the pure liquid states; this shows that our endpoints are accurate to within 1 meV for our ternary Gibbs free energy, as well as the absolute Gibbs free energy for the ternary liquid.

Title: Electron pairing by dispersive phonons in altermagnets: re-entrant superconductivity and continuous transition to finite momentum superconducting state
Authors: Ivan Iorsh
Abstract: We consider an altermagnet subject to the electron attractive potential mediated by the dispersive phonons. While altermagnetism suppresses superconductivity, scattering of electrons on the Fermi surface by thermal phonons suppresses altermagnetism. We show that this leads to the re-entrant superconductivity over temperature and to the stabilization of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) finite momentum superconducting state at low temperatures. The effect is mediated by the retardation effects and no d-wave pairing interaction is required.

Title: Possible high thermoelectric power factor in alkali-metal-intercalated BC$_3$: anisotropic multiple valleys originating from the van Hove singularity of graphene
Authors: Ryutaro Enami, Kazuhiko Kuroki, Masayuki Ochi
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the electronic structure of monolayer BC$_3$ and find that monolayer BC$_3$ hosts anisotropic multiple valleys originating from the splitting of the van Hove singularity in graphene. This splitting is caused by the inequivalency between boron and carbon atoms. To make use of the favorable electronic structure, we investigate the electronic structure of alkali-metal-intercalated BC$_3$, where intercalated atoms not only introduce the electron carriers but also suppress the interlayer coupling. We find that the interlayer transfer is effectively suppressed by potassium intercalation, by which the favorable electronic structure of monolayer BC$_3$ is kept. Finally, we perform model calculation with the onsite-energy offset, and verified that the strategy, introducing the splitting to the van Hove singularity, works well in general situations.

Title: Unveiling Coverage Dependent Interactions of N-Methylaniline with the Pt(111) Surface
Authors: Bushra Ashraf, Nils Brinkmann, Dave Austin, Duy Le, Katharina Al Shamery, Talat S. Rahman
Abstract: This study aims to elucidate the adsorption and surface chemistry of N-methylaniline (NMA) on Pt(111), using it as a model molecule to probe the activation mechanisms of aromatic amines on catalytic surfaces. Through a combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental techniques such as temperature programmed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (TP-XPS), temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and Fourier transform infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy(FT-IRRAS),we explored the coverage-dependent behaviour of NMA on Pt(111) to identify key steps in the activation process. The population of certain reaction paths is driven by a coverage dependent balance between molecule surface charge transfer and intermolecular interactions, dictating the selective activation of specific bonds. Our findings reveal how coverage influences the orientation and bonding of NMA on the Pt(111)surface. At lower coverages, the molecule binds to the surface through the phenyl ring and activation, facilitating C-N bond cleavage to the ring under HCN formation. In comparison, at higher coverages, the molecule binds only through the nitrogen atom and desorbs intact. These insights into variable bond activation lay the ground work for understanding the fundamental processes involved in potential heterogeneously catalyzed reactions of aromatic amines, contributing to the development of new catalytic strategies.

Title: Enhanced superconductivity in co-doped infinite-layer samarium nickelate thin films
Authors: Mingwei Yang, Heng Wang, Jiayin Tang, Junping Luo, Xianfeng Wu, Ruilin Mao, Wenjing Xu, Guangdi Zhou, Zhengang Dong, Bohan Feng, Lingchi Shi, Zhicheng Pei, Peng Gao, Zhuoyu Chen, Danfeng Li
Abstract: Rare-earth infinite-layer nickelates represent an emerging class of unconventional superconductors, with materials synthesis largely limited to early lanthanide compounds. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of phase-pure superconducting samarium-based infinite-layer nickelate thin films, including the first demonstration of Sm$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$, along with co-doped variants incorporating europium and calcium. These films, grown on LSAT (001) substrates, exhibit coherent lattice structures up to $\sim$ 9 nm thickness with minimal stacking faults. The co-doped compounds achieve a record-small c-axis parameter of 3.26 Å and display remarkable superconducting transition temperatures up to 32.5 K. We observe distinct magnetotransport behaviors in europium-containing samples, including negative magnetoresistance and field-enhanced superconductivity. By establishing a clear correlation between decreasing c-axis parameter and increasing critical temperature across different rare-earth systems, these findings establish clear materials design principles for achieving higher transition temperatures in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors through structural engineering of the rare-earth site.

Title: Identifying Majorana edge and end modes in Josephson junction of $p$-wave superconductor with magnetic barrier
Authors: Minakshi Subhadarshini, Amartya Pal, Pritam Chatterjee, Arijit Saha
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model describing a Josephson junction featuring a magnetically textured barrier within two-dimensional (2D) $p$-wave superconductor, considering both $p_x + p_y$ and $p_x + ip_y$ type pairing symmetries. Our study reveals the influence of the magnetic barrier strength and its spatial periodicity on the system's topological properties, in terms of local density of states and Josephson current calculations. Notably, we demonstrate that these parameters regulate the number of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological regime. Our setup further allows for the identification of three distinct topological phases, the differentiation between one-dimensional (1D) Majorana edge (either flat/dispersive and arising from intrinsic 2D $p$-wave pairing) and localized Majorana end modes, and an analysis of their hybridization through the Josephson current. In particular, the Josephson current exhibits a discontinuous jump due to the edge modes and pronounced hump in the $p_x + ip_y$ pairing case, directly linked to the hybridized Majorana modes. Moreover, our study opens a possible interesting avenue to distinguish between 1D Majorana edge modes and zero-dimensional end modes via Josephson current signatures.

Title: Generic power laws in higher-dimensional lattice models with multidirectional hopping
Authors: Animesh Hazra, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Anirban Mukherjee, Punyabrata Pradhan
Abstract: We show that lattice models in $d>1$ dimensions with mass-conserving and multidirectional hopping dynamics exhibit power-law correlations for generic parameter values, even {\it far} from phase transition point (if any). The key idea for generating the algebraic decay is the notion of {\it multidirectional} hopping, which means that several chunks of masses, or several particles, can hop out simultaneously from a lattice site in multiple directions, consequently breaking detailed balance. Notably, the systems are described by continuous-time Markov jump processes, are diffusive, {\it lattice-rotation symmetric}, spatially homogeneous and thus have {\it no} net mass current. Using hydrodynamic and exact microscopic theory, we show that, in dimensions $d > 1$, the steady-state static density-density and ``activity''-density correlations in the thermodynamic limit decay {\it universally} as $\sim 1/r^{(d+2)}$ at large distance $r=|{\bf r}|$; the strength of the power law is exactly calculated for several models and expressed in terms of the bulk-diffusion coefficient and mobility tensor. In particular, our theory explains why center-of-mass-conserving dynamics, used to model disordered {\it hyperuniform} state of matter, should result in generic long-ranged correlations in the systems.

Title: Universal Optical Conductivity from Quantum Geometry in Quadratic Band-Touching Semimetals
Authors: Chang-geun Oh, Sun-Woo Kim, Kun Woo Kim, Bartomeu Monserrat, Jun-Won Rhim
Abstract: Exploring the quantum geometric properties of solids beyond their topological aspects has become a key focus in current solid-state physics research. We derive the geometric formula for optical conductivity from the quantum metric tensor, applicable to the low-energy regime. This general formulation also depends on the detailed shape of the band dispersion in addition to the geometric properties of the Bloch wave function. We demonstrate, however, that for quadratic band-touching (QBT) semimetals, the optical conductivity simplifies to $\sigma = (e^2/8\hbar)d^2_\mathrm{max}$ when the light frequency exceeds a critical threshold, where $d_\mathrm{max}$ represents the maximum Hilbert-Schmidt quantum distance around the band-crossing point. This result indicates that the optical conductivity of QBT semimetals is universal and determined entirely by quantum geometry, independent of other details of the band structure. Furthermore, under time-reversal and rotational symmetries, $d_\mathrm{max}$ is restricted to discrete values of 0 or 1, leading to a quantized universal optical conductivity. Through first-principles calculations, we show that our findings are applicable to real materials, including bilayer graphene, Pd$_3$P$_2$S$_8$, and other realistic material candidates. Our work underscores the critical role of quantum geometry in governing optical properties, which can be probed through standard optical methods.

Title: A Promising Method for Strongly Correlated Electrons in Two Dimensions: Gutzwiller-Guided Density Matrix Renormalization Group
Authors: Hui-Ke Jin, Rong-Yang Sun, Hong-Hao Tu, Yi Zhou
Abstract: The study of strongly correlated electron systems remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly in two-dimensional (2D) systems hosting various exotic phases of matter including quantum spin liquids, unconventional superconductivity, and topological orders. Although Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) has established itself as a pillar for simulating one-dimensional quantum systems, its application to 2D systems has long been hindered by the notorious ``local minimum'' issues. Recent methodological breakthroughs have addressed this challenge by incorporating Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions as initial states for DMRG simulations. This hybrid approach, referred to as DMRG guided by Gutzwiller-projected wave functions (or Gutzwiller-guided DMRG), has demonstrated remarkable improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to explore exotic quantum phases such as topological orders. This review examines the theoretical underpinnings of this approach, details key algorithmic developments, and showcases its applications in recent studies of 2D quantum systems.

Title: Uncovering the underlying mechanisms of phase transitions in chiral active particles
Authors: Dongrun Jian, Jie Su, Jun Wang, Jin Wang
Abstract: Chiral active matter widely exists in nature and emerges rich dynamical behaviors. Among these, chiral active particles (CAPs) with alignment effects show novel collective motions such as orderly rotating droplets and distinct phase transitions under different chirality degrees. However, the underlying dynamical and thermodynamical mechanisms of the phase transitions in the CAP system are not quite clear. Here, by combining the nonequilibrium physics with the coarse-grained mapping method, we quantified the potential landscape and the flux field to reflect global driving forces of the CAP system, characterizing the number and location of the steady states. Moreover, we revealed that mean flux and entropy production rate are respectively the dynamical and thermodynamical origins for the nonequilibrium phase transition, further providing a practical tool to confirm the continuity of the phase transition and the phase boundary. Our findings may inspire the design of experimental CAPs and present a new approach for investigating phase transition behaviors in other complex active systems.

Title: Discrete spectrum of edge states in a two-dimensional topological insulator
Authors: A. I. Milstein, I. S. Terekhov
Abstract: The interaction model of two electrons in the edge states of a two-dimensional topological insulator is investigated. Both solutions of the Schrödinger equation and solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation at different values of the Fermi energy are considered. It is shown that for the Bethe-Salpeter equation, which takes into account the existence of the Fermi surface, there is a discrete spectrum in the system of two electrons. This phenomenon does not appear in the case of the Schrödinger equation.

Title: Quantum Geometry and Many-Body Landau-Zener Tunneling in Time-dependent Quantum Systems with Instantaneous Quantum Integrability
Authors: Xiao Wang, Xiaodong He, Jianda Wu
Abstract: We study quantum geometric effects in time-dependent quantum many-body systems quenched from integrable systems through a unitary transformation whose phase operator is linear in time. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the time-dependent many-body system, can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two-particle processes derived from the quantum integrable system. This geometric characterization provides a powerful lens for analyzing dynamical transitions in driven many-body settings. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze a prototypical time-dependent Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined, where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhbits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. When the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling. Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.

Title: Exploring the Finite-Temperature Behavior of Rydberg Atom Arrays: A Tensor Network Approach
Authors: Yuzhou Han, Hao Zhang, Lixin He
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for experimental research and a challenging subject for theoretical investigation in quantum science. In this study, we investigate the finite-temperature properties of two-dimensional square-lattice Rydberg atom arrays using the projected entangled pair states (PEPS) method. By analyzing the thermal behavior of systems in the checkerboard and striated phases, we extract critical exponents and identify phase transition characteristics. Our results confirm that the checkerboard phase transition belongs to the 2D Ising universality class, while the striated phase exhibits critical exponents that deviate from known universality classes, possibly due to finite-size effects. These findings provide theoretical insights into the thermal stability of quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays and offer valuable guidance for future experimental efforts.

Title: Emergent ferromagnetic ladder excitations in heavy fermion superconductor CeSb$_{2}$
Authors: Zhaoyang Shan, Yangjie Jiao, Jiayu Guo, Yifan Wang, Jinyu Wu, Jiawen Zhang, Yanan Zhang, Dajun Su, Devashibhai T. Adroja, Christian Balz, Matthias Gutmann, Yu Liu, Huiqiu Yuan, Zhentao Wang, Yu Song, Michael Smidman
Abstract: Low-dimensional spin fluctuations play a crucial role in unconventional superconductors, with quasi-one-dimensional spin excitations potentially linked with spin-triplet superconductivity. The heavy fermion superconductor CeSb$_2$ exhibits an unusual large inverted S-shaped upper critical field that suggests a possible triplet pairing state within its pressure-induced superconducting dome. Using inelastic neutron scattering, we discover quasi-one-dimensional magnetic excitations in CeSb$_2$ emerging from nearly square Ce layers with minor orthorhombic deformation. We show that the data are well described by a ferromagnetic spin ladder model, where the "rungs" of the ladder straddle Ce bilayers. Moreover, we find that diffuse excitations akin to those in the ordered phase persist well above $T_{\rm N}$, suggesting that quasi-one-dimensional ferromagnetic paramagnons may significantly contribute to the unusual superconductivity that appears under pressure once magnetic order is suppressed.

Title: Description processes of the interaction of water and aqueous solutions with fuel-containinig materials in the New Safe Confinement of the "Shelter'' object
Authors: M. V. Tokarchuk, B. M. Markovych, O. S. Zakharyash, O. L. Ivankiv, S. M. Mohnyak
Abstract: The main mechanisms and conditions of interaction of lava-like fuel-containing materials (LFCM) with the atmosphere, water and aqueous solutions are presented. The mechanisms of destruction of the LFCM surface, including ion-exchange processes, hydrolysis, dissolution, oxidation, etc., were analyzed. Inhomogeneous diffusion coefficients for UO$_{2}^{2+}$, Cs$^{+}$ ions at the interface "aqueous solution of radioactive elements - LFCM" were calculated. The interdiffusion processes and the rate of penetration into the porous medium of the reaction front of the internal hydrolysis of the silicon-oxygen network during interaction with an aqueous solution were analyzed, where the reaction and adsorption processes are hidden in the rate of internal hydrolysis.

Title: Theoretical study of thermoelectric properties of $\textrm{CeIr}_\textrm{4} \textrm{P}_\textrm{12}$ filled skutterudite for energy conversion
Authors: M. Bouchenaki, L. I. Karaouzène, B. N. Brahmi, M. Kaid Slimane
Abstract: The structural, elastic, thermodynamic and thermoelectric characteristics of the $\textrm{CeIr}_\textrm{4} \textrm{P}_\textrm{12}$ skutterudite have been predicted for the first time by applying density functional theory and the semi-classical Boltzmann simulations. Firstly, the structural-magnetic stability was verified through ground-state energy calculations obtained from structural optimizations. The predicted single-crystal elastic constants (${C}_{ij}$) show that the title compound is mechanically stable. At the same time, it turns out to be dynamically stable where all the calculated phonon frequencies have positive values. The cohesive energy was calculated to verify the energy stability of the material considered. We also determined the variations of some macroscopic physical parameters as functions of temperature, namely the thermal expansion coefficient, the lattice thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we investigated the temperature dependencies of some thermoelectric coefficients such as electronic thermal conductivity, and figure of merit. Such encouraging results indicate that the compound is a potential candidate for thermoelectric devices.

Title: Molecular Insights into the Crystallization of 4'-Hydroxyacetophenone from Water: Solute Aggregation, Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation and Polymorph Selection
Authors: Carlos E S Bernardes, Ricardo G Simões, M Soledade, C S Santos, Pedro L T Melo, Ângela F S Santos, Stéphane Veesler, Manuel E Minas da Piedade
Abstract: In this work insights into the structural rearrangements occurring in aqueous solution, prior to the nucleation of different 4'-hydroxyacetophenone (HAP) forms from water were obtained, through a combination of thermomicroscopy, micro-differential scanning calorimetry, density and speed of sound measurements, and molecular dynamics simulations. The results confirmed our previous observation that cooling crystallization of HAP is intermediated by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and, depending on the initially selected concentration range, selectively leads to the formation of different crystal forms. Analysis of the solution properties before the onset of LLPS revealed that, in the HAP mole fraction range xHAP \< 0.004 (Zone I), where hydrate H2 ultimately crystallizes, small, solvated clusters are initially present in solution, which remain approximately invariant in size, shape and HAP/H2O proportion as the temperature decreases. For the xHAP \&gt; 0.005 range (Zone III), where anhydrous form I crystallizes, large HAP/water aggregates (that can even percolate the whole system as xHAP approaches the 0.005 limit) are already initially present in solution. As cooling progresses, they become more compact, a process accompanied by a reduction in water content, and which is more significant as the solution concentration increases. The 0.004 \< xHAP \< 0.005 (Zone II) range corresponds to a transition region where, as xHAP increases, the physical properties of the solution initially evolve from those typical of Zone I and, at a certain point, abruptly change and start converging to those typical of Zone III. In all zones, the colloidal particles formed upon LLPS (from which crystallization results) can also reduce their water content on cooling, but the extent of this process increases as xHAP moves from Zones I and II, where hydrates are formed, to Zone III, where anhydrous Form I is produced.

Title: Triangular lattice magnet GdGa$_2$ with short-period spin cycloids and possible skyrmion phases
Authors: Priya R. Baral, Nguyen Duy Khanh, Masaki Gen, Hajime Sagayama, Hironori Nakao, Taka-hisa Arima, Yoshichika Ōnuki, Yoshinori Tokura, Max Hirschberger
Abstract: The two-dimensional triangular lattice (TAL) is a model system of magnetic frustration and competing interactions, where skyrmion spin vortices can be induced by a vertical magnetic field $B$. We target the binary compound GdGa$_2$ with an undistorted TAL of Gd$^{3+}$ Heisenberg moments. At higher temperature ($T > 5$ K, $B = 0$, phase II), we reveal the cycloidal spin textures in GdGa$_2$ via resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS). Further, a transition with strong magneto-elastic response occurs when cooling into the zero-field ground state ($T < 5$ K, phase I). We also report the thermodynamic phase boundaries of $B$-induced magnetic A-phases, which are suppressed by an in-plane magnetic field and which have enhanced resistivity due to the partial opening of a charge gap. In analogy to Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, these phases may represent a superposition of various cycloids, possibly a Néel skyrmion lattice. Our work lays the basis for further studies of the magnetic phase diagram of GdGa$_2$.

Title: Defect Accumulation in beta-Ga2O3 Implanted with Yb
Authors: Mahwish Sarwar, Renata Ratajczak, Cyprian Mieszczynski, Sylwia Gierałtowska, René Heller, Stefan Eisenwinder, Wojciech Woźniak, Elżbieta Guziewicz
Abstract: Radiation-induced crystal lattice damage and its recovery in wide bandgap oxides, in particular beta-gallium oxide (beta-Ga2O3), is a complex process. This paper presents the first study on the process of the defects accumulation in beta-Ga2O3 implanted with Rare Earth (RE) ions and the impact of Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA) on the defects formed. (-201) oriented beta-Ga2O3 single crystals were implanted with Yb ions fluences ranging from 1 x 1012 to 5 x 1015 at/cm2. Channeling Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS/c) was used to study the crystal lattice damage induced by ion implantation and the level of structure recovery after annealing. The quantitative and qualitative analyses of collected spectra were performed by computer simulations. The resulting accumulation curve reveals a two-step damage process. In the first stage, the damage of the beta-Ga2O3 is inconspicuous, but begins to grow rapidly from the fluence of 1 x 1013 at/cm2, reaching the saturation at the random level for the Yb ion fluence of 1 x 1014 at/cm2. Further irradiation causes the damage peak to become bimodal, indicating that at least two new defect forms develop for the higher ion fluence. These two damage zones differently react to annealing, suggesting that they could origin from two phases, the amorphization phase and the new crystalline phase of Ga2O3.

Title: Rietveld Refinement and NMR Crystallographic Investigations of Multicomponent Crystals Containing Alkali Metal Chlorides and Urea

Abstract: New mechanochemical preparations of three multicomponent crystals (MCCs) of the form MCl:urea.nH2O (M = Li+, Na+, and Cs+) are reported. Their structures were determined by an NMR crystallography approach, combining Rietveld refinement of synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction data (PXRD), multinuclear (35Cl, 7Li, 23Na, and 133Cs) solid-state NMR (SSNMR) spectroscopy, and thermal analysis. Mechanochemical syntheses of the three MCCs, two of which are novel, are optimized for maximum yield and efficiency. 35Cl SSNMR is well-suited for the structural characterization of these MCCs since it is sensitive to subtle differences and/or changes in chloride ion environments, providing a powerful means of examining H...Cl-bonding environments. Alkali metal NMR is beneficial for identifying the number of unique magnetically and crystallographically distinct sites and enables facile detection of educts and/or impurities. In the case of NaCl:urea.H2O, 23Na MAS NMR spectra are key, both for identifying residual NaCl educt and for monitoring NaCl:urea.H2O degradation, which appears to proceed via an autocatalytic decomposition process driven by water (with a rate constant of k = 1.22x10-3 s-1). SSNMR and PXRD were used to inform the initial structural models. Following Rietveld refinement, the models were subjected to dispersion-corrected plane-wave DFT geometry optimizations and subsequent calculations of the 35Cl EFG tensors, which enable the refinement of hydrogen atom positions, as well as the exploration of their relationships to the local hydrogen bonding environments of the chloride ions and crystallographic symmetry elements.

Title: Breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation in Stillinger-Weber Silicon
Authors: Himani Rautela, Shiladitya Sengupta, Vishwas V. Vasisht
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical properties of liquid and supercooled liquid silicon, modeled using the Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential, to examine the validity of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation. Towards this end, we examine the relationship among various dynamical quantities, including (i) the macroscopic transport coefficients - self diffusion coefficient $D$ and viscosity $\eta$, (ii) relaxation time $\tau_{\alpha}$ as well as (iii) lengthscale dependent relaxation times $\tau_{\alpha}(q)$ over a broad range of temperature $T$, pressure $P$ and density $\rho$ covering both equilibrium and metastable liquid state points in the phase diagram. Our study shows a weak break down in SE relation involving $D$ and $\eta$, and the loci of \Revision{the breakdown of the SE relation} (SEB) is found in the high T liquid phase. The $\tau_{\alpha}$, when used as a proxy to $\eta$, shows distinct breakdown in the SE relation whose loci is found in the supercooled liquid phase. Interestingly, certain parts of the phase diagram shows that loci of onset of slow dynamics lie below the loci of SEB, suggesting a regime that exhibits Arrhenius but non-Fickian behaviour. Computation of $\tau_{\alpha}(q)$ enables us to extract the lengthscale associated with the Fickian to non-Fickian behaviour using which we show that the \Revision{breakdown of the SE relation} occurs only below a specific lengthscale at a given temperature. Further we also compare the SEB loci with other features of the phase behaviour, including the loci of compressiblity maximum, density maximum as well as diffusivity maximum.

Title: Tracking the photoinduced dynamics of a dark excitonic state in single-layer WS$_2$ via resonant Autler-Townes splitting
Authors: Angela Montanaro, Francesco Valiera, Francesca Giusti, Francesca Fassioli, Chiara Trovatello, Giacomo Jarc, Enrico Maria Rigoni, Fang Liu, Xiaoyang Zhu, Stefano Dal Conte, Giulio Cerullo, Martin Eckstein, Daniele Fausti
Abstract: Excitons in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (1L-TMD) are highly bound states characterized by a Rydberg-like spectrum of discrete energy levels. Within this spectrum, states with odd-parity are known as dark excitons because transitions to the ground state are forbidden by selection rules. This makes their stationary and transient characterization challenging using linear optical techniques. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamics of a 2p dark excitonic state in 1L-WS$_2$ can be directly retrieved by measuring the Autler-Townes splitting of bright states in a three-pulse experiment. The splitting of the bright 1s excitonic state, observed by detuning a mid-infrared control field across the 1s-2p transition, provides an accurate characterization of the 2p state, which is used here to reveal its dynamics following a sudden photoinjection of free carriers in the conduction band. We observe a qualitatively different dynamics of the 1s and 2p levels, which is indicative of symmetry-dependent screening and exciton-exciton interactions. These findings provide new insights into many-body effects in TMDs, offering potential avenues for advancing the next generation optoelectronics.

Title: Influence of Aspect Ratio and Deformation on the Isotropic-Nematic Crossover in Quasi-One-Dimensional Hard Superellipses
Authors: Sakineh Mizani, Martin Oettel, Péter Gurin, Szabolcs Varga
Abstract: We study the orientational ordering and close packing behavior of a quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) hard superellipse system in which centers of particles are restricted to a line while they can rotate freely in a two-dimensional plane. Through the aspect ratio (k), the elongation of the particles and through the deformation parameter (n), the shape can be tuned between ellipses and rectangles. Maxima in the pressure ratio (P/Phd) (where P and Phd are the pressure of hard superellipses and that of q1D hard disks) are a good indicator for the continuous structural change from isotropic to nematic order. This change occurs at higher densities than the sharp nematic transitions of corresponding two-dimensional and three-dimensional hard body systems. Additionally, suitable close packing exponents describing the close-packing limit show universality in that they depending only on n and certain combinations are independent of both k and n.

Authors: Etienne Wamba, Jeremie Bai, A. Serge Tchakoutio Nguetcho
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical instabilities of an ultracold Bose-Bose mixture with long-range dipole-dipole interactions, trapped in deep optical lattices and subject to periodically varying contact interaction. The effect of beyond-mean-field corrections due to quantum fluctuations is considered. In the tight-binding regime, we employ Wannier functions to derive a discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation that captures the dynamics of the system. Using linear stability analysis coupled to multiple scale expansion, we systematically study the modulational and parametric instabilities of the system, identifying the conditions under which these instabilities emerge. The corresponding instability domains are found and examined. The roles of long-range interactions and quantum fluctuations are highlighted, demonstrating their significant impact on the stability and dynamics of the lattice system. Our analytical predictions are validated through direct numerical simulations, which confirm the instability diagrams through the effective onset of instabilities and reveal the intricate interplay between interaction strength, quantum fluctuation, and the long-range nature of the dipole-dipole forces. This work provides insights into the control and manipulation of ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices, which have potential applications in quantum simulation and condensed matter physics.

Title: Linear statistics at the microscopic scale for the 2D Coulomb gas
Authors: Pierre Le Doussal, Gregory Schehr
Abstract: We consider the classical Coulomb gas in two dimensions at the inverse temperature $\beta=2$, confined within a droplet of radius $R$ by a rotationally invariant potential $U(r)$. For $U(r)\sim r^2$ this describes the eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre ensemble of random matrices. We study linear statistics of the form ${\cal L}_N = \sum_{i=1}^N f(|{\bf x}_i|)$, where ${\bf x}_i$'s are the positions of the $N$ particles, in the large $N$ limit with $R=O(1)$. It is known that for smooth functions $f(r)$ the variance ${\rm Var} \,{\cal L}_N= O(1)$, while for an indicator function relevant for the disk counting statistics, all cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ of order $q \geq 2$ behave as $\sim \sqrt{N}$. In addition, for smooth functions, it was shown that the cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ of order $q \geq 3$ scale as $\sim N^{2-q}$. Surprisingly it was found that they depend only on $f'(|\bf x|)$ and its derivatives evaluated exactly at the boundary of the droplet. To understand this property, and interpolate between the two behaviors (smooth versus step-like), we study the microscopic linear statistics given by $f(r) \to f_N(r) = \phi((r-\hat r) \sqrt{N}/\xi)$, which probes the fluctuations at the scale of the inter-particle distance. We compute the cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ at large $N$ for a fixed $\phi(u)$ at arbitrary $\xi$. For large $\xi$ they match the predictions for smooth functions which shows that the leading contribution in that case comes from a boundary layer of size $1/\sqrt{N}$ near the boundary of the droplet. Finally we show that the full probability distribution of ${\cal L}_N$ take two distinct large deviation forms, in the regime ${\cal L}_N \sim \sqrt{N}$ and ${\cal L}_N \sim N$ respectively. We also discuss applications of our results to fermions in a rotating harmonic trap and to the Ginibre symplectic ensemble.

Title: Electronic structure of CeCo$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge$_3$ studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and first-principles calculations
Authors: P. Skokowski (1), K. Synoradzki (1,2), M. Werwiński (1), A. Bajorek (3), G. Chełkowska (3), T. Toliński (1) ((1) Institute of Molecular Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznań, Poland, (2) Institute of Low Temperature and Structure Research, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wrocław, Poland, (3) Institute of Physics, Silesian University, Katowice, Poland)
Abstract: A transformation between the magnetically ordered CeCoGe$_3$ and heavy fermion CeFeGe$_3$ is isostructural but not isoelectronic, therefore the characterization of the electronic structure of the CeCo$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge$_3$ series is of special importance. We report both the experimental investigation by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and the first-principles calculations within the full-potential local-orbital (FPLO) scheme based on the density functional theory. Experimentally, we investigate mainly the valence band and the Ce $3d$ spectra, both giving the possibility to conclude about the level of the $f$ states localization. Computationally, we investigate the most characteristic CeCoGe$_3$, CeCo$_{0.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$Ge$_3$, and CeFeGe$_3$ compositions. Based on the electronic band structure results, we calculate the X-ray photoelectron spectra of the valence band. We consider the effects of the spin-orbit coupling and intra-atomic Hubbard U repulsion. Furthermore, we discuss the charge distribution and occupation of valence-band orbitals. The experimentally observed evolution of the 3$d$ band with the Fe concentration is related to the decrease of the number of electrons and reduction of the 3$d$ photoionization cross-sections. Calculations indicate that charge is transferred mainly from the Ce to Ge sites and the bondings are formed mainly by the Ce 5$d$, Fe/Co 3$d$, and Ge 4$p$ and 4$s$ orbitals.

Title: Nanometric skyrmion lattice from anisotropic exchange interactions in a centrosymmetric host
Authors: Max Hirschberger, Satoru Hayami, Yoshinori Tokura
Abstract: Skyrmion formation in centrosymmetric magnets without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions was originally predicted from unbiased numerical techniques. However, no attempt has yet been made, by comparison to a real material, to determine the salient interaction terms and model parameters driving spin-vortex formation. We identify a Hamiltonian with anisotropic exchange couplings, local ion anisotropy, and four-spin interactions, which is generally applicable to this class of compounds. In the representative system Gd3Ru4Al12, anisotropic exchange drives a fragile balance between helical, skyrmion lattice, and transverse conical (cycloidal) orders. The model is severely constrained by the experimentally observed collapse of the SkL with a small in-plane magnetic field. For the zero-field helical state, we further anticipate that spins can be easily rotated out of the spiral plane by a tilted magnetic field or applied current.

Title: Screening in Hubbard models with long-range interactions
Authors: Florian Gebhard, Kevin Bauerbach, Örs Legeza
Abstract: We provide solid evidence for the long-standing presumption that model Hamiltonians with short-range interactions faithfully reproduce the physics of the long-range Coulomb interaction in real materials. For this aim, we address a generic Hubbard model that captures the quantum phase transitions between metal, Mott insulator, and charge-density-wave insulator, in the absence of Fermi-surface nesting. By comparing the quantum phase diagrams for the $1/r$-Hubbard model on a half-filled chain with nearest-neighbor and $1/r$-long-range interactions, we argue that the inclusion of long-range interactions is not crucial for a proper description of interacting many-electron systems. To this end, we employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method on finite lattices and antiperiodic boundary conditions to determine the quantum phase transitions between the metallic Luttinger liquid for weak interactions, the Mott-Hubbard insulator for dominant on-site interactions, and the charge-density wave insulator for dominant inter-site interactions. The two phase diagrams qualitatively agree inasmuch as the quantum phase transitions are continuous in both cases. Moreover, simple Hartree-Fock theory and the atomic limit provide renormalization factors that allow us to quantitatively map the two phase diagrams onto each other. As a practical advantage, our findings imply that computational efforts can be reduced tremendously by using models with short-range interactions only.

Title: Effective field theory for triple-Q magnetic orders on a hexagonal lattice
Authors: Jin-Tao Jin, Yi Zhou
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive Ginzburg-Landau theory describing triple-Q magnetic orders on hexagonal lattices, focusing on $O(N)$ models with $N=2$ and $N=3$. Through systematic analysis of symmetry-allowed terms in the free energy, we establish complete phase diagrams governed by competing interaction parameters. Our theory reveals distinct magnetic configurations including single-Q, double-Q, and triple-Q states, each characterized by unique symmetry breaking patterns and collective excitations. The framework provides fundamental insights into complex magnetic orders recently observed in materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, where the interplay between geometric frustration and multiple ordering vectors leads to exotic magnetic states. Our results establish clear connections between microscopic interactions, broken symmetries, and experimentally observable properties, offering a powerful tool for understanding and predicting novel magnetic phases in frustrated magnets.

Title: Entropy-assisted, long-period stacking of honeycomb layers in an AlB2-type silicide
Authors: Leonie Spitz, Takuya Nomoto, Shunsuke Kitou, Hironori Nakao, Akiko Kikkawa, Sonia Francoual, Yasujiro Taguchi, Ryotaro Arita, Yoshinori Tokura, Taka-hisa Arima, Max Hirschberger
Abstract: Configurational entropy can impact crystallization processes, tipping the scales between structures of nearly equal internal energy. Using alloyed single crystals of Gd2PdSi3 in the AlB2-type structure, we explore the formation of complex layer sequences made from alternating, two-dimensional triangular and honeycomb slabs. A four-period and an eight-period stacking sequence are found to be very close in internal energy, the latter being favored by entropy associated with covering the full configuration space of interlayer bonds. Possible consequences of polytype formation on magnetism in Gd2PdSi3 are discussed.

Title: Dzyalonshinskii-Moriya interaction in Fe5GeTe2 epitaxial thin films
Authors: J. Sampaio, A. Pascaud, E. Quero, A. Thiaville, V. Polewczyk, A. Marty, F. Bonell, A. Mougin
Abstract: Van der Waals ferromagnets, such as Fe5GeTe2, offer a promising platform for spintronic devices based on chiral magnetic textures, provided a significant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) can be induced to stabilise them. Here, we directly measure DMI in epitaxial Fe5GeTe2 thin films using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy and observe a consistent DMI (D = 0.04 mJ/m2) across various thicknesses. Its weak thickness dependence, combined with the nominally symmetric film interfaces, suggests a bulk origin. Although we do not determine the microscopic mechanism, our findings are compatible with ab-initio calculations linking DMI to partial ordering of Fe split sites. Additionally, we find a low magnetic dissipation (alpha < 0.003). The observed DMI, which could be further enhanced by optimising the Fe site ordering, combined with low dissipation, makes Fe5GeTe2 a strong candidate for exploring the dynamics of chiral magnetic textures in two-dimensional materials.

Title: Random quantum Ising model with three-spin couplings
Authors: Ferenc Iglói, Yu-Cheng Lin
Abstract: We apply a real-space block renormalization group approach to study the critical properties of the random transverse-field Ising spin chain with multispin interactions. First we recover the known properties of the traditional model with two-spin interactions by applying the renormalization approach for arbitrary size of the block. For the model with three-spin couplings we calculate the critical point and demonstrate that the phase transition is controlled by an infinite disorder fixed point. We have determined the typical correlation-length critical exponent, which seems to be different from that of the random transverse Ising chain with nearest-neighbor couplings. Thus this model represents a new infinite disorder universality class.

Title: Characterization of Nuclear and Magnetic Structures of Wolframite-Type MgReO4 and ZnReO4
Authors: Ugne Miniotaite, Ola K. Forslund, Elisabetta Nocerino, Yuqing Ge, Frank Elson, Michael Sannemo, Hiroya Sakurai, Jun Sugiyama, Hubertus Leutkens, Toru Ishigaki, Takafumi Hawai, Rasmus Palm, Chennan Wang, Yasmine Sassa, David W. Tam, Martin Månsson
Abstract: We utilized high-pressure methods to synthesize the oxides AReO$4$ (A=Zn, Mg) and characterized their crystal structures as monoclinic wolframite-type. By combining muon spin spectroscopy ($\mu^+$SR) with DFT calculations for muon stopping sites, we identify two possible magnetic spin structures for both compounds: $\Gamma_3$ with the propagation vector $\mathbf{k} = (0,1/2,0)$ and $\Gamma_4$ with $\mathbf{k} = (0,0,0)$. In both cases, the magnetic moments are canted from the principal axes within the $ac$-plane. The ordered moment of the proposed structures is $\mathbf{0.29(5)~\mu\mathrm{B}}$ for $\Gamma_3$ and $\mathbf{0.25(8)~\mu_\mathrm{B}}$ for $\Gamma_4$. The low moment is consistent with the absence of a magnetic contribution to the neutron powder diffraction (NPD) spectra. Bond valence sum (BVS) analysis supports the oxidation state of Re being Re$^{6+}$ in the compounds, and we suggest that a combination of $t_\mathrm{2g}$ orbital splitting due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and $d$-$p$ orbital hybridization is responsible for the strongly suppressed ordered magnetic moment.

Title: Accurate Formula for the Effective Conductivity of Highly Clustered Two-Phase Materials
Authors: Murray Skolnick, Salvatore Torquato
Abstract: Two-phase heterogeneous materials arising in a variety of natural and synthetic situations exhibit a wide-variety of microstructures and thus display a broad-spectrum effective physical properties. Given that such properties of disordered materials generally depend on an infinite-set of microstructural correlation functions that are typically unobtainable, in practice, one must consider rigorous bounds and approximations on the effective properties that depend on a limited set of nontrivial microstructural information. Torquato derived [Random Heterogeneous Materials, Microstructure and Macroscopic Properties (2002)] such an approximation for the effective thermal/electrical conductivity of two-phase microstructures that perturb about those that realize the well-known self-consistent formula; a key feature of such microstructures being phase-inversion symmetry which can be observed in certain cellular, bicontinuous, and porous materials. Here, we show via extensive numerical simulations that this virtually unexamined approximation, which depends on up to three-point correlations, predicts accurately the effective conductivities of various two- and three-dimensional two-phase microstructures across phase volume fractions in which both phases can form large and well-connected clusters; including certain phase-inversion symmetric microstructures as well as phase-inversion asymmetric dispersions of certain fully penetrable particles. We also highlight the accurate sensitivity of this approximation to phase-connectedness properties by showing that it predicts percolation thresholds that are in good quantitative and/or qualitative agreement with known thresholds for the models considered here. Finally, we discuss how this formula can be used to design materials with desirable effective conductivity properties and thus aid in materials by design.

Title: Large deformation and collapse analysis of re-entrant auxetic and hexagonal honeycomb lattice structures subjected to tension and compression
Authors: Sima Farshbaf, Narges Dialami, Miguel Cervera
Abstract: Additively manufactured auxetic structures offer desirable qualities like lightweight, good energy absorption, excellent indentation resistance, high shear stiffness and fracture toughness among others. A wide range of materials from polymers to metals can be used to fabricate these structures. In contrast to conventional materials, auxetic structures exhibit negative Poisson's ratios. Hence, unique mechanical properties can be achieved by specific design. In this work, two types of structures, namely re-entrant auxetic and non-auxetic hexagonal honeycomb, are investigated. Large deformation analyses in both 2D plane strain and 3D are conducted using linear triangular and tetrahedral multi-field displacement-pressure elements. Hyperelastic with rate-independent plasticity constitutive models are utilized and calibrated with experimental uni-axial tensile test results. The structures are subjected to compression and tension at both transversal and longitudinal directions. The contact domain method is employed to capture both self-contact and the interaction between the structure and loading plates. The obtained results show consistency with the experimental data. The outcomes of the analyses regarding the re-entrant auxetic structure agree with the expected behavior, showing a negative value of Poisson's ratio and greater efficiency of energy absorption than the hexagonal honeycomb. By understanding the influence of the loading direction on the structural behavior, equivalent Poisson's ratio and energy absorption a reliable theoretical framework for prospective designs of the lattice materials can be established.

Title: Capillary force-driven particle orientation in rod networks
Authors: Lingyue Liu, Sebastian Gassenmeier, Erin Koos
Abstract: Capillary suspensions containing anisotropic rod particles exhibit complex microstructural behaviors. Our study investigates the orientation, network formation, and rheological properties of glass microrods in capillary suspensions with varying secondary liquid volumes. Using confocal microscopy, rheometry, and rheoconfocal techniques, we reveal how capillary forces affect particle alignment and movement, and consequently, the microstructure of the samples. As the volume fraction of the secondary liquid increases, the structure of the rod network exhibits a transition from point-to-point contact to side-to-side aligned clusters. This structural change leads to pronounced changes in coordination number, clustering coefficient, and particle orientation distribution. In contrast to spherical systems, the average clustering coefficient decreases with increasing coordination number, denoting the formation of particle clusters with complex configurations instead of solely side-to-side alignment. Rheological measurements demonstrate the sensitivity of rod-based networks to deformation, with shorter linear viscoelastic regions compared to spherical particle systems. The research provides insights into designing advanced materials with tunable mechanical properties through controlled particle interactions.

Title: Large deviations of density fluctuations in the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process
Authors: Denis Bernard, Tony Jin, Stefano Scopa, Shiyi Wei
Abstract: We consider the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process (QSSIP) which describes a one-dimensional system of bosonic particles with stochastic nearest-neighbor hopping, modeled as a Brownian motion, with gain/loss processes at the endpoints of the chain driving the system out-of-equilibrium. Although the averaged QSSIP dynamics differs from that of the Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (QSSEP) - the analogous system where bosons are replaced by fermions - we show that, paradoxically, the dynamics of their matrices of two-point functions, along with all their fluctuations, coincide. In contrary, the underlying classical models differs significantly, as the bosonic statistics allow the inclusion of multiple particles at the same site, in contrast to (symmetric) simple exclusion processes (SSEP). We provide an exact derivation of the large deviation function of density fluctuations in QSSIP and, as a consequence, in the classical inclusion process (SSIP) by exploiting its quantum formulation. Remarkably, our study highlights that, both in QSSEP and QSSIP, fluctuations of the local densities are typically classical, i.e. the cumulant generating functions of the local densities are asymptotically self-averaging and converge toward those of the classical SSEP and SSIP, realization-wise. This provides a test of the conjectured almost sure classical behavior of transport fluctuations, at leading order in the system size, in noisy diffusive quantum many-body systems.

Title: Lateral force microscopy calibration using an interferometric atomic force microscope
Authors: Joel Lefever, Aleksander Labuda, Roger Proksch
Abstract: A new method is introduced for calibrating lateral force as measured by an atomic force microscope (AFM), making use of both an interferometric detector and an optical beam detector on the same instrument. The method may be implemented automatically and performed with minimal user input. The microscope has the capability to measure the probe tip height in situ, which allows for a complete lateral force calibration without changing the sample or probe. Two options for lateral force measurements are described wherein the two detectors are alternately used to measure normal and lateral forces, and methods for applying the calibration protocol for both alternatives are provided. The tip height measurement is validated by direct comparison with an electron micrograph and they are generally in agreement to within 1.4 microns. For most cantilevers tested, the complete lateral calibration method is consistent with the wedge calibration method to within the intrinsic uncertainty of the wedge method.

Title: A geometrically inspired constitutive framework for damage and intrinsic self-healing of elastomers
Authors: Sanhita Das, Nivedita Kumari
Abstract: Autonomic interfacial self-healing in elastomers enables their reprocessing and recycling, making them valuable for applications such as ballistic resistance, surface coatings, adhesives, and biomedical materials. This article prescribes a geometry-based damage-healing theory for autonomic healing in elastomers, built on a framework where damage induces an incompatibility in the Euclidean material manifold, transforming it into a Riemannian manifold. Healing restores the Euclidean state through a reversing damage variable or an evolving healing variable. The reversing damage variable models the rebonding mechanism while the healing variable accounts for healing by chain diffusion and entanglement. The model also predicts healing where rebonding is preceded by chain diffusion. The microforce balance governs the evolution of the damage and healing variables, capturing rate-dependent damage and intrinsic temperature-independent healing. The model is validated through numerical simulations, including one-dimensional and two-dimensional simulations, demonstrating accurate predictions of coupling between damage and healing and post-healing mechanical response. The model also predicts the recovery of fracture toughness with healing time in supramolecular elastomers, aligning with experimental data. With minimal parameters, the model is versatile and can easily be used for material design and structural analysis, surpassing existing models in simplicity and predictive capability.

Title: Adhesion differentials control the rheology of biomimetic emulsions
Authors: Quentin Guigue, Marc Besse, Raphael Voituriez, Alexis M. Prevost, Elie Wandersman, Matthias Merkel, Lea-Laetitia Pontani
Abstract: Animal morphogenesis involves complex tissue deformation processes, which require tight control over tissue rheology. Yet, it remains insufficiently understood how tissue rheology results from the interplay between its supracellular structure and cellular forces, such as cortical tension, cellular pressure, and cell-cell adhesion. Here, we follow a biomimetic approach to study this interplay, focusing on the cellular adhesion hierarchy. We mimic adhesive cells with oil droplets whose adhesion strength and specificity can be flexibly tuned. Using microfluidics, we expose 2D emulsions to an oscillatory shear, and we develop a method to quantify their rheology using only image data. We find that emulsions made of two droplet types with a high adhesion differential progressively change their yielding behavior across subsequent shear cycles. Combining this with vertex model simulations, we show that the observed drift in yielding behavior is due to a progressive compaction, which only occurs in emulsions with a high adhesion differential and only when exposed to oscillatory shear. Gradients of cell compaction have been observed during animal development. Our work demonstrates how such gradients can be used to control gradients of tissue rheological properties. Moreover, the progressive compaction suggests the emergence of a pumping mechanism, which potentially acts in many cellular materials, from tissues to foams.

Title: Pseudopotentials that move: From inertia to electromagnetism
Authors: Massimiliano Stengel, Miquel Royo, Emilio Artacho
Abstract: Recent works have pointed out some worrisome inconsistencies in linear-response calculations performed with nonlocal pseudopotentials. Here we show that most of these issues are fixed by correctly adapting the pseudopotential to the motion of the corresponding nucleus, with a velocity dependence of the nonlocal operator. This prescription restores the correct Galilean covariance of the Schrödinger equation, and the expected identity between mechanical rototranslations and electromagnetic perturbations. We demonstrate our arguments by relating the interatomic force constants to the electromagnetic susceptibility of the system via a set of exact sum rules. Among other virtues, these results conclusively reconcile the inertial and electrical definitions of the Drude weight in metals.

Title: Content-Addressable Memory with a Content-Free Energy Function
Authors: Félix Benoist, Luca Peliti, Pablo Sartori
Abstract: Content-addressable memory, i.e. stored information that can be retrieved from content-based cues, is key to computation. Besides natural and artificial neural networks, physical learning systems have recently been shown to have remarkable ability in this domain. While classical neural network models encode memories as energy minima, biochemical systems have been shown to be able to process information based on purely kinetic principles. This opens the question of whether neural networks can also encode information kinetically. Here, we propose a minimal model for content-addressable memory in which the kinetics, and not the energy function, are used to encode patterns. We find that the performance of this kinetic encoding approach is comparable to that of classical energy-based encoding schemes. This highlights the fundamental significance of the kinetic stability of kinetic traps as an alternative to the thermodynamic stability of energy minima, offering new insights into the principles of computation in physical and synthetic systems.

Title: Dome-like pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$
Authors: Liam A. V. Nagle-Cocco, James M. A. Steele, Shiyu Deng, Xiaotian Zhang, Dominik Daisenberger, Annalena R. Genreith-Schriever, Siddharth S. Saxena, Clare P. Grey, Si^an E. Dutton
Abstract: NaNiO$_2$ is a Ni$^{3+}$-containing layered material consisting of alternating triangular networks of Ni and Na cations, separated by octahedrally-coordinated O anions. At ambient pressure, it features a collinear Jahn--Teller distortion below $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}\approx480$ K, which disappears in a first-order transition on heating to $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{end}\approx500$ K, corresponding to the increase in symmetry from monoclinic to rhombohedral. It was previously studied by variable-pressure neutron diffraction [ACS Inorganic Chemistry 61.10 (2022): 4312-4321] and found to exhibit an increasing $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$ with pressure up to ~5 GPa. In this work, powdered NaNiO$_2$ was studied via variable-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction up to pressures of ~67 GPa at 294 K and 403 K. Suppression of the collinear Jahn--Teller ordering is observed via the emergence of a high-symmetry rhombohedral phase, with the onset pressure occurring at ~18 GPa at both studied temperatures. Further, a discontinuous decrease in unit cell volume is observed on transitioning from the monoclinic to the rhombohedral phase. These results taken together suggest that in the vicinity of the transition, application of pressure causes the Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$, to decrease rapidly. We conclude that the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$ is dome-like.

Title: Impact of Nonlocal Coulomb Repulsion on Superconductivity and Density-Wave Orders in Bilayer Nickelates
Authors: Jun Zhan, Congcong Le, Xianxin Wu, Jiangping Hu
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and its thin films has sparked significant interest in understanding their pairing mechanism and correlated states. While previous theoretical studies have mainly focused on onsite Coulomb interactions, the role of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion has been neglected, leaving its effect unexplored and elusive. In this work, we comprehensively explore the effect of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion on both superconductivity and density-wave orders in the presence of onsite interactions by performing functional renormalization group calculations. We find that interlayer repulsion suppresses the interlayer intra-orbital $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing and spin-density-wave order, while driving a transition to an interlayer inter-orbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing and a mirror-symmetry breaking charge order. This transition occurs across a wide range of charge doping and is independent of the presence of the $\gamma$ pocket around M point. Remarkably, the critical scale of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is significantly lower than that of the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity, suggesting that the former pairing is unlikely to account for the observed high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Additionally, the intralayer nearest-neighbor repulsion promotes an in-plane charge density wave order with a vector of $(\pi,\pi)$. Our findings highlight profound impact of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion and the robustness of interlayer pairing associated with the bilayer structure and multi-orbital nature, advancing the understanding of the complex correlation effects within bilayer nickelates.

Title: Optimizing compensation in Ising spin-$1/2$ site-diluted trilayered square ferrimagnets: Insights from Monte Carlo Simulations
Authors: Soham Chandra
Abstract: This study employs Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis algorithm to investigate the thermomagnetic properties of a site-diluted trilayered ferrimagnetic system with spin-$1/2$ particles placed on square monolayers. The system is composed of two different types of theoretical atoms, labeled $A$ and $B$, resulting in two distinct configurations, $ABA$ and $AAB$. Atoms of the same type $(A-A$ and $B-B)$ exhibit ferromagnetic interactions, while unlike atoms $(A-B)$ display antiferromagnetic interactions. The $A$-layers are randomly site-diluted with non-magnetic atoms and the percentage of dilution is varied from 5\% to 45\%. Depending upon the concentration of these impurities, both the compensation and critical points shift, leading to different equilibrium ferrimagnetic behaviors. The phase area in the Hamiltonian parameter space, \textit{without} compensation, scales according to the relation: $\ln |A(\rho)/\tilde{A}|=ae^{b\rho}$ . Attention is paid to the mathematical relationships between the compensation temperature and the concentration of nonmagnetic impurities. Suggested mathematical formulas reveal how the threshold impurity concentration is linked to the Hamiltonian parameters.

Title: Scaling properties of diblock copolymers: dynamic simulations study
Authors: K. Haydukivska
Abstract: The influence of monomer-monomer interactions on the scaling exponents and shape characteristics of a single polymer chain in a selective solvent is investigated using Langevin dynamics simulations. By systematically increasing the temperature of the solution, the effects of interactions between blocks on the conformational properties of the chain are explored. The results demonstrate that longer-range interactions cause a transition of a polymer similar to the transition for homopolymers; short-range repulsive interactions between different blocks have a negligible impact on the effective scaling exponents: they are the same regardless of the blocks being globule and coil or ideal and swollen coils.

Abstract: We consider the valence bond solid (VBS) state built of singlet pairs of fundamental representations and projected onto adjoint representations of the exceptional Lie group G$_2$. The two-point correlation function in the VBS state is non-vanishing only for nearest neighbours, but possesses finite string order. We construct a parent Hamiltonian for the VBS state, which constitutes the G$_2$ analog of the famous AKLT chain.

Title: Defect Engineering in Large-Scale CVD-Grown Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Formation, Spectroscopy, and Spin Relaxation Dynamics

Lupini, Marti Checa, Liam Collins, Huan Zhao, Farzana Likhi, Kai Xiao, Ilia Ivanov, David Glasgow, Alexander Tselev, Benjamin Lawrie, Sergei Smirnov, Steven Randolph
Abstract: Recently, numerous techniques have been reported for generating optically active defects in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which hold transformative potential for quantum photonic devices. However, achieving on-demand generation of desirable defect types in scalable hBN films remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that formation of negative boron vacancy defects, VB-, in suspended, large-area CVD-grown hBN is strongly dependent on the type of bombarding particles (ions, neutrons, and electrons) and irradiation conditions. In contrast to suspended hBN, defect formation in substrate-supported hBN is more complex due to the uncontrollable generation of secondary particles from the substrate, and the outcome strongly depends on the thickness of the hBN. We identify different defect types by correlating spectroscopic and optically detected magnetic resonance features, distinguishing boron vacancies (formed by light ions and neutrons) from other optically active defects emitting at 650 nm assigned to anti-site nitrogen vacancy (NBVN) and reveal the presence of additional dark paramagnetic defects that influence spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and zero-field splitting parameters, all of which strongly depend on the defect density. These results underscore the potential for precisely engineered defect formation in large-scale CVD-grown hBN, paving the way for the scalable fabrication of quantum photonic devices.

Title: Advances of Mayer's cluster approach in quantitative theoretical description of phase transitions for various lattice models of matter
Authors: M. V. Ushcats, L. A. Bulavin, S. Yu. Ushcats, Zh. Yu. Burunina, O. V. Maiboroda, N. O. Romanchuk, N. O. Shapoval
Abstract: Resent achievements in statistical theory, namely, a possibility to reproduce almost unlimited Mayer's activity series based on the information about their convergence radius, on the one hand, and generalization of the lattice statistics by eliminating the simplification of nearest-neighbor interactions, on the other hand, have allowed accurate quantitative description of the condensation in lattice gases, spontaneous magnetization in ferromagnets, and spinodal decomposition in binary mixtures by evaluating only several irreducible cluster integrals (virial coefficients). In particular, the results of calculations indicate qualitative and even quantitative universality in the behavior of the mentioned lattice systems of different geometry and dimensionality at the same values of a certain reduced temperature when that behavior is expressed in terms of some dimensionless parameters. An additional possibility to describe the order-disorder phase transitions in some other lattice systems (e.g., antiferromagnets and alloys) is also discussed in the paper.

Title: On the temperature, pressure and composition effects in the properties of water-methanol mixtures. I. Density, excess mixing volume and enthalpy, and self-diffusion coefficients from molecular dynamics simulations
Authors: M. Cruz Sanchez, V. Trejos Montoya, O. Pizio
Abstract: We report the temperature, pressure and composition dependence of some basic properties of model liquid water-methanol mixtures. For this purpose the isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics computer simulations are employed. Our principal focus is on the united atom non-polarizable UAM-I-EW model for methanol which was recently parametrized the paper by Garcia-Melgarejo et al. [J. Mol. Liq., 2021, 323, 114576], combined with the TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ water model. In perspective, the methanol model permits a convenient extension for other monohydric alcohols mixed with water. The behavior of density, excess mixing volume and enthalpy are described. Partial mixing properties are interpreted. Besides, we explored the trends of behavior of self-diffusion coefficients of the species of a mixture. The quality of predictions of the model is critically evaluated by detailed comparisons with experimental results. Various results are novel and provide new insights into the behavior of the mixtures in question at different temperatures and at high pressures. An improvement of the modelling necessary for further research is discussed.

Title: Variational solution of the superconducting Anderson impurity model and the band-edge singularity phenomena
Authors: Teodor Iličin, Rok Žitko
Abstract: We propose a set of variational wavefunctions for the sub-gap spin-doublet and spin-singlet eigenstates of the particle-hole symmetric superconducting Anderson impurity model. The wavefunctions include up to two Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the continuum which is necessary to correctly capture the weak-coupling asymptotics in all parameter regimes. The eigenvalue problems reduce to solving transcendental equations. We investigate how the lowest singlet state evolves with increasing charge repulsion $U$, transitioning from a proximitized state (a superposition of empty and doubly occupied impurity orbitals, corresponding to an Andreev bound state) to a local moment that is Kondo screened by Bogoliubov quasiparticles (Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state). This change occurs for $U = 2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the BCS gap. At this point, the band-edge effects make the eigenenergy scale in a singular way as $\Gamma^{2/3}$, where $\Gamma$ is the hybridization strength. Away from this special point, regular $\Gamma$-linear behavior is recovered, but only for $\Gamma \lesssim (U/2-\Delta)^2/\Delta$. The singular behavior thus extends over a broad range of parameters, including those relevant for some quantum devices in current use. The singular state is an equal-superposition state with maximal fluctuations between the local impurity charge configurations. Accurately capturing the band-edge singularity requires a continuum model, and it cannot be correctly described by discrete (truncated) models such as the zero-bandwidth approximation or the superconducting atomic limit. We determine the region of parameter space where the second spin-singlet state exists: in addition to the whole $U<2\Delta$ ABS region, it also includes a small part of the $U>2\Delta$ YSR region for finite values of $\Gamma$, as long as some ABS component is admixed.

Title: Entropy of a restricted primitive model electrolyte using a mean electrostatic potential approach
Authors: S. Lamperski, L. B. Bhuiyan, C. W. Outhwaite, R. Gorniak
Abstract: The excess entropy of restricted primitive model electrolytes is calculated using a potential based approach through the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann and the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theories. The theories are utilized in conjunction with a statistical thermodynamics equation that is shown to be equivalent to thermodynamic integration. Electrolyte systems having ionic valencies 1:1 and 2:2 with diameters $3 \times 10^{-10}$~m and 4.25 $\times 10^{-10}$ m are treated over a wide range of concentrations. The exact radial distribution functions for the model electrolytes obtained from Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble are compared with the corresponding theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the radial distribution functions from the theories and the simulations are used in the Laird-Haymet entropy expansion equations [J. Chem. Phys., 1994, 100, 3775] to estimate the excess entropy of the solutions. These equations take into account multi-particle distribution functions, which are approximated using a ``ring'' term. In general, the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory gives results that are more consistent with the simulation data than those from the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann theory. The results show that the excess entropy is negative with its absolute value increasing for 1:1 electrolytes with increasing concentration. The symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann values are slightly overestimated, while the modified Poisson-Boltzmann values are slightly underestimated relative to the simulations. The curves for 1:1 electrolytes including that from the Laird-Haymet equations are consistent with each other, while only the MPB curves for 2:2 electrolytes at $4.25 \times 10^{-10}$ m are qualitative relative to the simulations up to about 1 mol/dm$^{3}$. The 2:2 electrolyte curves reveal a characteristic inflection and plateau....

Title: Phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model via Krylov spread complexity
Authors: E.Medina-Guerra, I.V. Gornyi, Yuval Gefen
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) with an imaginary chemical potential via Krylov spread complexity and Krylov fidelity. The spread witnesses the PT-transition for the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum of the SSH Hamiltonian, where the spectrum goes from purely real to complex (oscillatory dynamics to damped oscillations). In addition, it also witnesses the transition occurring in the PT-broken phase, where the spectrum goes from complex to purely imaginary (damped oscillations to sheer decay). For a purely imaginary spectrum, the Krylov spread fidelity, which measures how the time-dependent spread reaches its stationary state value, serves as a probe of previously undetected dynamical phase transitions.

Title: In-plane magnetic field-induced orbital FFLO superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers
Authors: Jihang Zhu, Yang-Zhi Chou, Yi Huang, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: We theoretically predict the in-plane magnetic field-induced orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting states in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers (tWSe$_2$), focusing on its dependence on layer polarization and Fermi surface geometry. For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moiré mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.

Title: Path integral calculation for emergence of rapid evolution from demographic stochasticity
Authors: Hong-Yan Shih, Nigel Goldenfeld
Abstract: Genetic variation in a population can sometimes arise so fast as to modify ecosystem dynamics. Such phenomena have been observed in natural predator-prey systems, and characterized in the laboratory as showing unusual phase relationships in population dynamics, including a $\pi$ phase shift between predator and prey (evolutionary cycles) and even undetectable prey oscillations compared to those of the predator (cryptic cycles). Here we present a generic individual-level stochastic model of interacting populations that includes a subpopulation of low nutritional value to the predator. Using a master equation formalism, and by mapping to a coherent state path integral solved by a system-size expansion, we show that evolutionary and cryptic quasicycles can emerge generically from the combination of intrinsic demographic fluctuations and clonal mutations alone, without additional biological mechanisms.

Title: 2D Spintronics for Neuromorphic Computing with Scalability and Energy Efficiency
Authors: Douglas Z. Plummer, Emily D'Alessandro, Aidan Burrowes, Joshua Fleischer, Alexander M. Heard, Yingying Wu
Abstract: The demand for computing power has been growing exponentially with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This growth requires unconventional computing primitives that prioritize energy efficiency, while also addressing the critical need for scalability. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the biological brain, offers a transformative paradigm for addressing these challenges. This review paper provides an overview of advancements in 2D spintronics and device architectures designed for neuromorphic applications, with a focus on techniques such as spin-orbit torque, magnetic tunnel junctions, and skyrmions. Emerging van der Waals materials like CrI3, Fe3GaTe2, and graphene-based heterostructures have demonstrated unparalleled potential for integrating memory and logic at the atomic scale. This work highlights technologies with ultra-low energy consumption (0.14 fJ/operation), high switching speeds (sub-nanosecond), and scalability to sub-20 nm footprints. It covers key material innovations and the role of spintronic effects in enabling compact, energy-efficient neuromorphic systems, providing a foundation for advancing scalable, next-generation computing architectures.

Title: Refining spectroscopic calculations for trivalent lanthanide ions: a revised parametric Hamiltonian and open-source solution
Authors: Juan-David Lizarazo-Ferro, Tharnier O. Puel, Michael E. Flatté, Rashid Zia
Abstract: The historical calculation of spectroscopic properties for trivalent lanthanide ions is a complex multistep process that has been prone to inaccuracies. In this work, we revise the parametric semi-empirical Hamiltonian and address long-standing discrepancies in the literature. We also resurface the distinctions between orthogonal and non-orthogonal operators and use orthogonal operators to provide an alternative parametric description. Based on experimental data available in the literature, a new set of parameter values for the ions in LaF$_3$ and LiYF$_4$ is presented. Additionally, we provide calculations of spontaneous emission rates and oscillator strengths for magnetic dipole transitions in the LaF$_3$ crystal host. To ensure the replicability of our findings, we make available the open-source code $\mathbf{\texttt{qlanth}}$, accompanied by a comprehensive set of electronic files to serve as an updated reference for future calculations.

Title: Quantum ATK Analysis and Detection of Toxic Gases Nitrogen Oxide using Pristine, Defective, and Doped Graphene
Authors: Raju Kumar Yadav, Prince Philip, Boddepalli SanthiBhushan
Abstract: While doping and defects are often considered detrimental to material performance, at the nanoscale, modifications are needed to create novel properties beneficial for device applications. In this work, we focus on optimizing graphene as a gas sensor for detecting toxic gases such as nitrogen oxide (NO). The study explores the effects of doping graphene sheets with transition metals (Cu, Au, Pt) and introducing a single vacancy (SV) defect at the center of the sheet. Pristine, defected, and doped graphene sheets are systematically analyzed as potential sensing materials for NO gas detection. The investigation includes the design of graphene-based devices and the evaluation of their electrical I-V characteristics under different configurations. The sensing mechanism is examined through parameters such as electronic properties, charge transfer, adsorption energy, electrical characteristics (I-V), sensitivity, and the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach. The results indicate that defected graphene demonstrates superior gas adsorption performance, with an adsorption energy of 8.316 eV and a sensitivity of 51.1%, outperforming both pristine and doped graphene. These findings establish defected graphene as a promising candidate for NO gas sensing applications, while doped graphene shows moderate sensing potential.

Title: An atomistic approach for modeling of polarizability and Raman scattering of water clusters and liquid water
Authors: Atanu Paul, Ilya Grinberg
Abstract: In this work, we develop a framework for atomistic modeling of electronic polarizability to predict the Raman spectra of hydrogen-bonded clusters and liquids from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The total polarizability of the system is assumed to arise from contributions of both the monomer unit and intermolecular interactions. The generalized bond-polarizability model (GBPM), inspired by the classic bond-polarizability model, effectively describes the electronic polarizability of a monomer. To account for the electronic polarizability arising from intermolecular interactions, we use a basis set of rapidly decaying functions of interatomic distances. We apply this model to calculate the electronic polarizability and Raman spectra of water clusters ((H2O)r, r = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and liquid water. The computational results are compared with the results of quantum-mechanical calculations for clusters and to experimental data for the liquid. It is demonstrated that this simple and physically motivated model, which relies on a small number of parameters, performs well for clusters at both low and high temperatures, capturing strong anharmonic effects. Moreover, its high transferability suggests its applicability to other water clusters. These results suggest that a hierarchical approach based on the Jacob's ladder of increasingly sophisticated and accurate atomistic polarizability models incorporating additional effects can be used for efficient modeling of Raman spectra from MD simulations of clusters, liquids and solids.

Title: Making Truncated Wigner for dissipative spins 'plain easy'
Authors: Hossein Hosseinabadi, Oksana Chelpanova, Jamir Marino
Abstract: We put forward a user-friendly framework of the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) for dissipative quantum many-body systems. Our approach is computationally affordable and it features a straightforward implementation. The leverage of the method can be ultimately traced to an intimate connection between the TWA and the semi-classical limit of the quantum Langevin equation, which we unveil by resorting to a path integral representation of the Lindbladian. Our approach allows us to explore dynamics from early to late times in a variety of models at the core of modern AMO research, including lasing, central spin models, driven arrays of Rydbergs and correlated emission in free space. Notably, our TWA outperforms the method of cumulant expansion in terms of efficiency, ease of use, and broad applicability. We therefore argue that TWA could become in the near future a primary tool for a fast and efficient first exploration of driven-dissipative many-body dynamics on consumer grade computers.

Title: Quantum null energy condition in quenched 2d CFTs
Authors: Tanay Kibe, Pratik Roy
Abstract: The quantum null energy condition (QNEC) is a lower bound on the expectation value of the null-null component of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of null variations of the entanglement entropy. A stronger version of the QNEC (the primary QNEC) is expected to hold in 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories (CFT). QNEC has been shown to impose non-trivial quantum thermodynamic restrictions on irreversible entropy production in quenches in 1+1 dimensional holographic CFTs. It is therefore natural to study if QNEC imposes similar bounds in other quench setups. In this paper we study QNEC in the Calabrese-Cardy global and local joining quenches using standard CFT techniques. In the global quench we show that the primary QNEC must hold at sufficiently early times and find that it imposes bounds on the four point correlators of twist fields in a boundary state. This is a constraint on the set of boundary states that satisfy the primary QNEC. Furthermore, we find that a violation of the primary QNEC implies a violation of the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) in a conformally transformed frame. In the local quench we find similar bounds on four point correlators from both the primary and the usual QNEC.

Title: Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures
Authors: Tâm Johan Nguyên, Darrick Lee, Bernadette Jana Stolz
Abstract: The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.

Title: Equivariant Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials with Global Charge Redistribution
Authors: Moin Uddin Maruf, Sungmin Kim, Zeeshan Ahmad
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to quantum mechanical simulations for predicting material properties. Message-passing graph neural networks, commonly used in these MLIPs, rely on local descriptor-based symmetry functions to model atomic interactions. However, such local descriptor-based approaches struggle with systems exhibiting long-range interactions, charge transfer, and compositional heterogeneity. In this work, we develop a new equivariant MLIP incorporating long-range Coulomb interactions through explicit treatment of electronic degrees of freedom, specifically global charge distribution within the system. This is achieved using a charge equilibration scheme based on predicted atomic electronegativities. We systematically evaluate our model across a range of benchmark periodic and non-periodic datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms both short-range equivariant and long-range invariant MLIPs in energy and force predictions. Our approach enables more accurate and efficient simulations of systems with long-range interactions and charge heterogeneity, expanding the applicability of MLIPs in computational materials science.

Title: Large $N$ Wess-Zumino model at finite temperature and large chemical potential in $3d$
Authors: Srijan Kumar
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.

Title: The Stochastic Mechanics of Hawking Radiation
Authors: Noah M. MacKay
Abstract: In Ref. arXiv:2502.08816, Hawking radiation was analyzed through a statistical mechanics framework, revealing a structured microstate description of black hole horizons and information transfer into the radiation background. This study extends that approach by formulating Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation in the language of stochastic mechanics, employing an analytical Langevin framework and a numerical Euler iteration scheme. Both methods confirm that small black holes behave as thermal systems with Gaussian noise, while larger black holes develop a structured noise spectrum that aligns with the gradual contraction of the horizon. This suggests an alternative interpretation of Hawking radiation as an effective surface fuzziness, encoding horizon-scale fluctuations. The appendix provides a Wolfram Mathematica blueprint for numerical simulations, open to heuristic modifications for further exploration of black hole noise spectra.

Title: The probability of almost all eigenvalues being real for the elliptic real Ginibre ensemble
Authors: Gernot Akemann, Sung-Soo Byun, Yong-Woo Lee
Abstract: We investigate real eigenvalues of real elliptic Ginibre matrices of size $n$, indexed by the asymmetric parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$. In both the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes, where $\tau \in [0,1)$ is fixed or $1-\tau=O(1/n)$, respectively, we derive the asymptotic expansion of the probability $p_{n,n-2l}$ that all but a finite number $2l$ of eigenvalues are real. In particular, we show that the expansion is of the form $$\begin{align*} \log p_{n, n-2l} = \begin{cases} a_1 n^2 +a_2 n + a_3 \log n +O(1) &\text{at strong non-Hermiticity}, \\ b_1 n +b_2 \log n + b_3 +o(1) &\text{at weak non-Hermiticity}, \end{cases} \end{align*}$$ and we determine all coefficients explicitly. Furthermore, in the special case where $l=1$, we derive the full-order expansions. For the proofs, we employ distinct methods for the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes. In the former case, we utilise potential-theoretic techniques to analyse the free energy of elliptic Ginibre matrices conditioned to have $n-2l$ real eigenvalues, together with strong Szegő limit theorems. In the latter case, we utilise the skew-orthogonal polynomial formalism and the asymptotic behaviour of the Hermite polynomials.

Title: Effective field theory for weakly bound two-neutron halo nuclei: corrections from neutron-neutron effective range
Authors: Davi B. Costa, Masaru Hongo, Dam Thanh Son
Abstract: Using an effective field-theoretical approach, we investigate the properties of weakly bound two-neutron halo nuclei (also known as Borromean nuclei) that do not support a low-energy $s$-wave core-neutron resonance. Extending the recently formulated effective field theory for weakly bound Borromean nuclei, we incorporate corrections arising from the effective range of neutron-neutron scattering and evaluate their impact on the mean-square radii and electromagnetic response. In particular, we compute the ratio of the matter and charge radii, the shape of the $E1$ dipole strength function, and the electric polarizability. Our results indicate that these corrections remain numerically small when the two-neutron separation energy of the Borromean nucleus is much less than 1~MeV.

Title: Localization in the Dirac spectrum and gauge-field topology
Authors: Claudio Bonanno, Matteo Giordano
Abstract: We study localization of the low Dirac modes in 3+1 dimensional pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory at zero and nonzero imaginary $\theta$ angle, with the aim of better characterizing the relation between low-mode localization and topological features of gauge theories. We show that the mobility edge observed in the deconfined phase at $\theta=0$ is present also at nonzero $\theta$, appearing exactly at the deconfinement transition. We find that the mobility edge is affected by topology only indirectly, through its effects on the ordering of the Polyakov loop. Moreover, the change in the mobility edge is strongly correlated with the change in the Polyakov-loop expectation value, both as one moves along the critical line, and as one departs from it toward higher temperatures. This further strengthens the connection between low-mode localization and deconfinement, showing in particular the key role played by the ordering of the Polyakov loop.

Title: First Computation of Entanglement Dynamics in the SYK Model on Quantum Computers
Authors: Talal Ahmed Chowdhury, Kwangmin Yu, Raza Sabbir Sufian
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, fundamental to quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, features random all-to-all quartic or higher-order interactions, exhibiting both maximal chaos and exact solvability--yet its entanglement entropy has remained challenging and never been measured on a real quantum device. We overcome this limitation by presenting the first measurement of entanglement entropy growth under the SYK Hamiltonian using IBM's superconducting quantum computer. We implement an optimized version of swap-based many-body interference protocol, alleviating the challenges posed by IBM's limited qubit connectivity. Additionally, to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the randomized measurement protocol, we expand the unitary ensemble, which increases the volume of quantum circuits that are difficult to execute on current quantum computers. We tackle this challenge for the first time by parallelizing these quantum circuits through quantum multi-programming--establishing a foundation for how tailored innovations reveal complex quantum dynamics within current hardware constraints.

Title: Dynamically Learning to Integrate in Recurrent Neural Networks
Authors: Blake Bordelon, Jordan Cotler, Cengiz Pehlevan, Jacob A. Zavatone-Veth
Abstract: Learning to remember over long timescales is fundamentally challenging for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). While much prior work has explored why RNNs struggle to learn long timescales and how to mitigate this, we still lack a clear understanding of the dynamics involved when RNNs learn long timescales via gradient descent. Here we build a mathematical theory of the learning dynamics of linear RNNs trained to integrate white noise. We show that when the initial recurrent weights are small, the dynamics of learning are described by a low-dimensional system that tracks a single outlier eigenvalue of the recurrent weights. This reveals the precise manner in which the long timescale associated with white noise integration is learned. We extend our analyses to RNNs learning a damped oscillatory filter, and find rich dynamical equations for the evolution of a conjugate pair of outlier eigenvalues. Taken together, our analyses build a rich mathematical framework for studying dynamical learning problems salient for both machine learning and neuroscience.

Title: Optomechanical quantum bus for donor spins in silicon
Authors: Henri Lyyra, Cliona Shakespeare, Simeoni Ahopelto, Teemu Loippo, Alberto Hijano, Reetu Inkilä, Pyry Runko, Tero T. Heikkilä, Juha T. Muhonen
Abstract: Silicon is the foundation of current information technology, and also a very promising platform for the future quantum information technology. This is because the silicon-based qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times and silicon is the underlying material for advanced photonics. In addition, photonics structures in silicon can be used to define optomechanical cavities where the vibrations of nanoscale mechanical resonators can be probed down to the quantum level with laser light. Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers. We present an optimized geometry of the proposed device and discuss with the help of numerical simulations the predicted performance of the proposed quantum bus. We analyze the optomechanical spin readout fidelity find the optimal donor species for the strain and magnetic field gradient coupling. We also study the gate fidelity of a two-qubit gate for a universal gate set and discuss future developments.

Title: Transport in multifractal Kraichnan flows: from turbulence to Liouville quantum gravity
Authors: André L. P. Considera, Simon Thalabard
Abstract: We investigate the behaviors of fluid parcel trajectories in a multifractal extension of the Kraichnan model of turbulent advection, obtained by coupling one-dimensional monofractal white-in-time Gaussian flows to a frozen-in-time Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC). The resulting random flows are characterized by the interplay between a smoothness exponent $\xi\in(0,1)$ controlling the correlation decay of the Gaussian component and the intermittency parameter $\gamma \in (0,\sqrt 2)$ prescribing the deviations from self-similarity. In recent numerical work, this coupling was observed to induce a smoothing effect, whereby two-particle separations exhibit behavior similar to those in (monofractal) Gaussian flows only with increased smoothness exponent. The purpose of this work is to develop a rigorous theory of this phenomenon, contrasting the quenched setting where the GMC has prescribed realization to an annealed setting where the GMC is averaged over. Using the theory of 1D Markov processes we characterize the Lagrangian flow through boundary behaviors at the origin for the two-particle separation process upon varying $\xi$ and $\gamma$. This extends to a multifractal setting the stochastic/deterministic transition and the coalescing/non-coalescing transition well known in the monofractal Kraichnan setting. We show that the separation process present some analogies with multiplicative 1D versions of the Liouville Brownian Motion, a canonical diffusion evolving within a random landscape induced by the GMC and previously introduced in the context of Liouville quantum gravity. In particular, both quenched and annealed phase diagrams are retrieved upon considering a multiplicative Liouville Brownian motion characterized by a smoothness parameter $\xi+\gamma^2$ and an intermittency exponent $\gamma$.

Title: Self-Organizing Graph Reasoning Evolves into a Critical State for Continuous Discovery Through Structural-Semantic Dynamics
Authors: Markus J. Buehler
Abstract: We report fundamental insights into how agentic graph reasoning systems spontaneously evolve toward a critical state that sustains continuous semantic discovery. By rigorously analyzing structural (Von Neumann graph entropy) and semantic (embedding) entropy, we identify a subtle yet robust regime in which semantic entropy persistently dominates over structural entropy. This interplay is quantified by a dimensionless Critical Discovery Parameter that stabilizes at a small negative value, indicating a consistent excess of semantic entropy. Empirically, we observe a stable fraction (12%) of "surprising" edges, links between semantically distant concepts, providing evidence of long-range or cross-domain connections that drive continuous innovation. Concomitantly, the system exhibits scale-free and small-world topological features, alongside a negative cross-correlation between structural and semantic measures, reinforcing the analogy to self-organized criticality. These results establish clear parallels with critical phenomena in physical, biological, and cognitive complex systems, revealing an entropy-based principle governing adaptability and continuous innovation. Crucially, semantic richness emerges as the underlying driver of sustained exploration, despite not being explicitly used by the reasoning process. Our findings provide interdisciplinary insights and practical strategies for engineering intelligent systems with intrinsic capacities for long-term discovery and adaptation, and offer insights into how model training strategies can be developed that reinforce critical discovery.

Title: Magnetic monopole relaxation effects in spin ice Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Richard Edberg, Akash Khansili, Ingrid Marie Fjellvåg, Lise Ørduk Sandberg, Petronella Pascale Deen, Kim Lefmann, Patrik Henelius, Andreas Rydh
Abstract: Spin ice compounds enable the exploration of the dynamics of magnetic monopoles in condensed matter systems. In this study, we use ac calorimetry to probe the dynamical response of the heat capacity of the classical spin-ice compounds Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures (0.5-5 K). Using frequencies of 0.01-500 Hz, we find a strong frequency dependence in the measured heat capacity and are able to study thermal relaxation effects on the corresponding timescales. The relaxation time $\tau$ is determined from the frequency dependence of the heat capacity as the characteristic frequency below which the heat capacity saturates. The extracted $\tau$ shows a divergent behavior below 1 K reaching $\sim$6 s at 0.65 K, similar to the relaxation time seen in previous studies. Corresponding specific heat shows a maximum around this temperature. Performing dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, we verify that the specific heat frequency response has its origin in the slow magnetic monopole dynamics indigenous to spin ice. We find a timescale of 20 ms per Monte Carlo step at 4 K in contrast to 2.5 ms mentioned in previous studies by other techniques.

Title: Dynamical quantum phase transitions in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate and criticality enhanced quantum sensing
Authors: Lu Zhou, Jia Kong, Zhihao Lan, Weiping Zhang
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions universally exist in the ground and excited states of quantum many-body systems, and they have a close relationship with the nonequilibrium dynamical phase transitions, which however are challenging to identify. In the system of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates, though dynamical phase transitions with correspondence to equilibrium phase transitions in the ground state and uppermost excited state have been probed, those taken place in intermediate excited states remain untouched in experiments thus far. Here we unravel that both the ground and excited-state quantum phase transitions in spinor condensates can be diagnosed with dynamical phase transitions. A connection between equilibrium phase transitions and nonequilibrium behaviors of the system is disclosed in terms of the quantum Fisher information. We also demonstrate that near the critical points parameter estimation beyond standard quantum limit can be implemented. This work not only advances the exploration of excited-state quantum phase transitions via a scheme that can immediately be applied to a broad class of few-mode quantum systems, but also provides new perspective on the relationship between quantum criticality and quantum enhanced sensing.

Title: Exact Spectral Function of One-Dimensional Bose Gases
Authors: Song Cheng, Yang-Yang Chen, Xi-Wen Guan, Wen-Li Yang, Rubem Mondaini, Hai-Qing Lin
Abstract: Exactly solved models provide rigorous understanding of many-body phenomena in strongly correlated systems. In this article, we report a breakthrough in uncovering universal many-body correlated properties of quantum integrable Lieb-Liniger model. We calculate exactly the dynamical correlation functions by computing the form factor through a newly developed method, by which we are capable of calculating all possible "relative excitations" over the ground state or a finite temperature state at a high precision. Consequently, full spectral functions obtained for the model manifests the unique power-law singularity behaviour at the spectral threshold, confirming the validity of nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory. Our method advances the theory of dynamical correlation functions with high precision towards the thermodynamic limit, and is capable of benchmarking experimental observation of such novel correlated properties.

Title: Spin-resolved electronic structure of ferromagnetic triple-layered ruthenate Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$
Authors: Prosper Ngabonziza, Jonathan D. Denlinger, Alexei V. Fedorov, Gang Cao, J. W. Allen, G. Gebreyesus, Richard M. Martin
Abstract: High-resolution angle- and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of the triple-layered ruthenate Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$ reveals features of the electronic structure that extend our understanding of the layered strontium ruthenates. The spectra near the Fermi energy are very different from the non-magnetic analogues Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ with distinct Fermi surfaces for wide electron-like minority spin bands around the zone center and narrow hole-like majority spin Fermi surface contours around the zone corners. The most dramatic results are two narrow spectral peaks $\sim$30 meV below the Fermi-level, a spin-minority hole-like band at the Brillouin zone center, and a spin-majority saddle-band van Hove singularity at the zone edge, which exhibits almost 100\% spin-polarization at low temperature, and a strong temperature dependent coherence-incoherence crossover attributed to Hund metal correlations. Quantitative comparison of the ARPES to spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations identify the specific antibonding and nonbonding orbital origins of the narrow bands, with a prediction of different spatial localization in the central and outer layers. This is shown to be consistent with experimental ARPES multi-zone matrix element intensity variations, and implicates outer-layer-specific control of the in-plane metamagnetism. The renormalization of the bands relative to the mean-field DFT, the demonstration of spin-polarized oxygen bands, and of spin-minority and spin-majority band-crossing hybridization, provide a more complete picture of the magnetism which displays aspects of both delocalized and local moment behavior.

Title: Unusually Strong Four-Phonon Scattering Effects on Low-Temperature Thermal Conductivity in Two-Dimensional Materials
Authors: H. F. Feng, B. Liu, Xin-Gao Gong, Zhi-Xin Guo
Abstract: First principles-based predictions of lattice thermal conductivity (TC) from perturbation theory have achieved significant success. Usually, it only included three-phonon (3ph) scattering processes, only recently four-phonon (4ph) scattering processes were found to have a comparable impact as 3ph scattering at medium and high temperatures in various materials. While the influence of 4ph scattering on TC at low temperatures was generally believed to be insignificant. By combining the first-principles calculations, machine learning techniques, and Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), we find that there are unusually strong 4ph processes even in the low-frequency range of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as h-XN (X = B, Al, Ga), which have a remarkable influence on the low-temperature TC. Such strong 4ph processes originated from the out-of-plane acoustic (ZA) phonon mode of 2D materials. Furthermore, we find that the intensity of 4ph scattering and thus TC can be effectively manipulated by changing the dispersion of ZA phonon mode, which can be easily achieved through strain engineering. The present study provides new insights into low-temperature phonon transport and its manipulation in 2D materials.

Title: Respective Roles of Electron-Phonon and Electron-Electron Interactions in the Transport and Quasiparticle Properties of SrVO$_3$
Authors: David J. Abramovitch, Jernej Mravlje, Jin-Jian Zhou, Antoine Georges, Marco Bernardi
Abstract: The spectral and transport properties of strongly correlated metals, such as SrVO$_3$ (SVO), are widely attributed to electron-electron ($e$-$e$) interactions, with lattice vibrations (phonons) playing a secondary role. Here, using first-principles electron-phonon ($e$-ph) and dynamical mean field theory calculations, we show that $e$-ph interactions play an essential role in SVO: they govern the electron scattering and resistivity in a wide temperature range above 30 K, and induce an experimentally observed kink in the spectral function. In contrast, the $e$-$e$ interactions control quasiparticle renormalizations and low temperature transport, and enhance the $e$-ph coupling. We clarify the origin of the near $T^2$ temperature dependence of the resistivity by analyzing the $e$-$e$ and $e$-ph limited transport regimes. Our work disentangles the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in a prototypical correlated metal, revealing the dominant role of $e$-ph interactions in SVO.

Title: Constructing vortex functions and basis states of Chern insulators: ideal condition, inequality from index theorem, and coherent-like states on von Neumann lattice
Authors: Nobuyuki Okuma
Abstract: In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators in the tight-binding formalism. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. This degree of freedom serves as a discrete analog of the non-uniformity in the spatial metric and magnetic field in a continuous model. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone. These basis sets are expected to be useful for many-body calculations of fractional Chern insulators.

Title: Self-trapping phenomenon, multistability and chaos in open anisotropic Dicke dimer
Authors: G. Vivek, Debabrata Mondal, Subhadeep Chakraborty, S. Sinha
Abstract: We investigate semiclassical dynamics of a coupled atom-photon interacting system described by a dimer of anisotropic Dicke model in the presence of photon loss, exhibiting a rich variety of non-linear dynamics. Based on symmetries and dynamical classification, we characterize and chart out various dynamical phases in a phase diagram. A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from a saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics self-trapped limit cycle, hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.

Title: Error evaluation of partial scattering functions obtained from contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering
Authors: Koichi Mayumi, Tatsuro Oda, Shinya Miyajima, Ippei Obayashi, Kazuaki Tanaka
Abstract: Contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering (CV-SANS) is a powerful tool to evaluate the structure of multi-component systems by decomposing scattering intensities $I$ measured with different scattering contrasts into partial scattering functions $S$ of self- and cross-correlations between components. The measured $I$ contains a measurement error, $\Delta I$, and $\Delta I$ results in an uncertainty of partial scattering functions, $\Delta S$. However, the error propagation from $\Delta I$ to $\Delta S$ has not been quantitatively clarified. In this work, we have established deterministic and statistical approaches to determine $\Delta S$ from $\Delta I$. We have applied the two methods to (i) computational data of a core-shell sphere and experimental CV-SANS data of (ii) clay/polyethylene glycol (PEG) aqueous solutions and (iii) polyrotaxane solutions, and have successfully estimated the errors of \(S\). The quantitative error estimation of \(S\) offers us a strategy to optimize the combination of scattering contrasts to minimize error propagation.

Title: A General Approach for Determining Applicability Domain of Machine Learning Models
Authors: Lane E. Schultz, Yiqi Wang, Ryan Jacobs, Dane Morgan
Abstract: Knowledge of the domain of applicability of a machine learning model is essential to ensuring accurate and reliable model predictions. In this work, we develop a new and general approach of assessing model domain and demonstrate that our approach provides accurate and meaningful domain designation across multiple model types and material property data sets. Our approach assesses the distance between data in feature space using kernel density estimation, where this distance provides an effective tool for domain determination. We show that chemical groups considered unrelated based on chemical knowledge exhibit significant dissimilarities by our measure. We also show that high measures of dissimilarity are associated with poor model performance (i.e., high residual magnitudes) and poor estimates of model uncertainty (i.e., unreliable uncertainty estimation). Automated tools are provided to enable researchers to establish acceptable dissimilarity thresholds to identify whether new predictions of their own machine learning models are in-domain versus out-of-domain.

Title: Stochastic density functional theory for ions in a polar solvent
Authors: Pierre Illien, Antoine Carof, Benjamin Rotenberg
Abstract: In recent years, the theoretical description of electrical noise and fluctuation-induced effects in electrolytes has gained a renewed interest, enabled by stochastic field theories like stochastic density functional theory (SDFT). Such models, however, treat solvents implicitly, ignoring their generally polar nature. In the present study, starting from microscopic principles, we derive a fully explicit SDFT theory that applies to ions in a polar solvent. These equations are solved to compute observables like dynamic charge structure factors and dielectric susceptibilities. We unveil the relative importance of the different contributions (solvent, ions, cross terms) to the dynamics of electrolytes, which are key to understand the couplings between ions and the fluctuations of their microscopic environment.

Title: Minimum time connection between non-equilibrium steady states: the Brownian gyrator
Authors: A. Patrón, C. A. Plata, A. Prados
Abstract: We study the problem of minimising the connection time between non-equilibrium steady states of the Brownian Gyrator. This is a paradigmatic model in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, an overdamped Brownian particle trapped in a two-dimensional elliptical potential, with the two degrees of freedom $(x,y)$ coupled to two, in principle different, thermal baths with temperatures $T_x$ and $T_y$, respectively. Application of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle reveals that shortest protocols belong to the boundaries of the control set defined by the limiting values of the parameters $(k,u)$ characterising the elliptical potential. We identify two classes of optimal minimum time protocols, i.e. brachistochrones: (i) regular bang-bang protocols, for which $(k,u)$ alternatively take their minimum and maximum values allowed, and (ii) infinitely degenerate singular protocols. We thoroughly investigate the minimum connection time over the brachistochrones in the limit of having infinite capacity for compression. A plethora of striking phenomena emerge: sets of states attained at null connection times, discontinuities in the connection time along adjacent target states, and the fact that, starting from a state in which the oscillators are coupled, uncoupled states are impossible to reach in a finite time.

Title: Partial presentence of memory in bubble breakup: incomplete universality acquired by broken symmetry
Authors: Ikumi Yoshino, Ko Okumura
Abstract: When a water drop falls from a faucet, the drop is created with the formation of an axisymmetric constriction region, which thins down to breakup. Near the singularity of the breakup the physics at small scales becomes important, which could lead to universal dynamics independent of the scales setting the initial boundary conditions, as if memories were lost. This is true in the drop breakup surrounded by air or less viscous fluid, but not in the bubble breakup surrounded by more viscous fluid, under no geometrical confinement. Recently, it has been reported that the axisymmetry at the constriction region can be broken when a system of bubble breakup is confined. Here, we focus on the confined and non-axisymmetric breakup and find its dynamics self-similar: shapes of the liquid-air interface at different times collapsing onto a master curve. Unexpectedly, the master curve depends on the smallest among the length scales setting the initial boundary conditions but not on the other scales: The system retains partial memory, acquiring an incomplete universality by broken symmetry. Furthermore, we find the collapse is space-time dependent: the collapse onto the linear region of the master curve near the breakup tip persists for long time after breakup, while the parabolic region away from the tip is observed only for short time. We elucidate the physics in our findings, including the space-time dependent collapse, exploiting analogy with critical phenomena, which has guided recent developments across physics.

Title: Correlation versus dissipation in a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model
Authors: Kazuki Yamamoto, Masaya Nakagawa, Norio Kawakami
Abstract: We analyze the competition between strong correlations and dissipation in quantum impurity systems from the Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime by developing a slave-boson theory for a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss. Notably, in the non-Hermitian Kondo regime, strong correlations qualitatively change the nature of dissipation through renormalization effects, where the effective one-body loss is suppressed and emergent many-body dissipation characterized by the complex-valued hybridization is generated. We unveil the mechanism of a dissipative quantum phase transition of the Kondo state on the basis of this renormalization effect, which counterintuitively enhances the lifetime of the impurity against loss. We also find a crossover from the non-Hermitian Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime dominated by one-body dissipation. Our results can be tested in a wide variety of setups such as quantum dots coupled to electronic leads and quantum point contacts in ultracold Fermi gases.

Title: Fate of poor man's Majoranas in the long Kitaev chain limit
Authors: Melina Luethi, Henry F. Legg, Daniel Loss, Jelena Klinovaja
Abstract: A minimal Kitaev chain, consisting of two quantum dots connected via a superconductor, can host highly localized near-zero-energy states, known as poor man's Majoranas (PMMs). These states have been proposed as promising candidates to study Majorana bound states (MBSs) in a highly tunable setup. However, it is unclear whether and how PMMs observed in real systems are actually connected to the topological phase of the full Kitaev chain. Here, we study PMMs using a microscopic model and show that, in the long chain limit, not all PMMs are related to topological states. Rather, in long chains, some PMMs evolve into trivial highly localized low-energy states. We provide an explanation for the occurrence of these states and show that there is no clear conductance signature that is able to distinguish PMMs that evolve into true topological states from PMMs that evolve into trivial states.

Title: Interface dynamics of wet active systems
Authors: Fernando Caballero, Ananyo Maitra, Cesare Nardini
Abstract: We study the roughening of interfaces in phase-separated active suspensions on substrates. At both large length and timescales, we show that the interfacial dynamics belongs to the |q|KPZ universality class discussed in Besse et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 187102 (2023). This holds despite the presence of long-ranged fluid flows. At early times, however, or for sufficiently small systems, the roughening exponents are the same as those in the presence of a momentum-conserving fluid. Surprisingly, when the effect of substrate friction can be ignored, the interface becomes random beyond a de Gennes-Taupin lengthscale which depends on the interfacial tension.

Title: One-body correlations and momentum distributions of trapped one-dimensional Bose gases at finite temperature
Authors: Attila Takács, Yicheng Zhang, Pasquale Calabrese, Jerôme Dubail, Marcos Rigol, Stefano Scopa
Abstract: We introduce a general approximate method for calculating the one-body correlations and the momentum distributions of one-dimensional Bose gases at finite interaction strengths and temperatures trapped in smooth confining potentials. Our method combines asymptotic techniques for the long-distance behavior of the gas (similar to Luttinger liquid theory) with known short-distance expansions. We derive analytical results for the limiting cases of strong and weak interactions, and provide a general procedure for calculating one-body correlations at any interaction strength. A step-by-step explanation of the numerical method used to compute Green's functions (needed as input to our theory) is included. We benchmark our method against exact numerical calculations and compare its predictions to recent experimental results.

Title: Nonlinear transport theory at the order of quantum metric
Authors: Zhen-Hao Gong, Z. Z. Du, Hai-Peng Sun, Hai-Zhou Lu, X. C. Xie
Abstract: Quantum metric, a probe to spacetime of the Hilbert space, has been found measurable in the nonlinear electronic transport thus has attracted tremendous interest. However, without comparing with mechanisms tied to disorder, it is still unclear whether the quantum metric dominates in recent experiments. We exhaust all possible mechanisms of nonlinear transport under the same symmetry that the quantum metric emerges, by finding five more disorder-related mechanisms and their nonlinear conductivity formulas. With the help of the formulas, we derive the scaling law to identify distinct mechanisms in the recent experiments [Gao, et al., Science 381, 181 (2023); Wang, et al., Nature 621, 487 (2023)], determine nonzero nonlinear conductivity elements for all 122 magnetic point groups to guide future experiments, and calculate the nonlinear conductivity to explain the sophisticated features in the experiments of the even-layered MnBi$_2$Ti$_4$ thin films. Our theory will facilitate future experiments and applications of nonlinear transport.

Title: Room temperature Planar Hall effect in nanostructures of trigonal-PtBi2

Abstract: Trigonal-PtBi2 has recently garnered significant interest as it exhibits unique superconducting topological surface states due to electron pairing on Fermi arcs connecting bulk Weyl nodes. Furthermore, topological nodal lines have been predicted in trigonal-PtBi2, and their signature was measured in magnetotransport as a dissipationless, i.e. odd under a magnetic field reversal, anomalous planar Hall effect. Understanding the topological superconducting surface state in trigonal-PtBi2 requires unravelling the intrinsic geometric properties of the normal state electronic wavefunctions and further studies of their hallmarks in charge transport characteristics are needed. In this work, we reveal the presence of a strong dissipative, i.e. even under a magnetic field reversal, planar Hall effect in PtBi2 at low magnetic fields and up to room temperature. This robust response can be attributed to the presence of Weyl nodes close to the Fermi energy. While this effect generally follows the theoretical prediction for a planar Hall effect in a Weyl semimetal, we show that it deviates from theoretical expectations at both low fields and high temperatures. We also discuss the origin of the PHE in our material, and the contributions of both the topological features in PtBi2 and its possible trivial origin. Our results strengthen the topological nature of PtBi2 and the strong influence of quantum geometric effects on the electronic transport properties of the low energy normal state.

Title: Resistively detected electron spin resonance and g-factor in few-layer exfoliated MoS2 devices
Authors: Chithra H. Sharma, Appanna Parvangada, Lars Tiemann, Kai Rossnagel, Jens Martin, Robert H. Blick
Abstract: MoS2 has recently emerged as a promising material for enabling quantum devices and spintronic applications. In this context, an improved physical understanding of the g-factor of MoS2 depending on device geometry is of great importance. Resistively detected electron spin resonance (RD-ESR) could be employed to and the determine the g-factor in micron-scale devices However, its application and RD-ESR studies have been limited by Schottky or high-resistance contacts to MoS2. Here, we exploit naturally n-doped few-layer MoS2 devices with ohmic tin (Sn) contacts that allow the electrical study of spin phenomena. Resonant excitation of electron spins and resistive detection is a possible path to exploit the spin effects in MoS2 devices. Using RD-ESR, we determine the g-factor of few-layer MoS2 to be ~1.92 and observe that the g-factor value is independent of the charge carrier density within the limits of our measurements.

Title: Geometric Breaking of Quantum Strings in Kagome Rydberg Atom Array
Authors: Wei Xu, Xue-Feng Zhang
Abstract: Leveraging the rapid development of quantum simulators, the intriguing phenomena of string breaking are observed across various quantum simulation platforms \cite{Rydberg_kagome,qbit_string_breaking}. However, the strings can only be broken by quenching the tension energy due to the system size limitation, such "tensile breaking" behaves quite the same as in one-dimension \cite{ion_string_breaking}. To discover the distinctive properties of quantum strings in two dimensions, we utilize a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo method to simulate a ten times larger scale (743-site) Kagome Rydberg atom array which can be described with U(1) lattice gauge theory. With designed edges, one end of the string can be easily grasped, allowing for clearly observing the dynamics of the dangling gauge charge at the open end. Then, we can drag each end in opposite directions perpendicular to the string. As the separation distance increases, asymptotic freedom-like behavior is detected. Eventually, the string breaks because the distance between both ends surpasses the string's length, so named "geometric breaking". Distinct from "tensile breaking," the two newly formed strings are suddenly uncorrelated, accompanied by a sudden energy increase. Lastly, we study multiple strings and successfully prepare a heart-like superposition state of broken and unbroken quantum strings with three gauge charges attached reminiscent of quarks and gluon. This work can benefit the comprehension of quantum strings and also shed light on the simulation of high-energy physics.

Title: Collective excitations and universal coarsening dynamics of a spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Rajat, Paramjeet Banger, Sandeep Gautam
Abstract: We study the collective excitation spectrum of a Raman-induced spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a quasi-one-dimensional harmonic trap while varying either the Raman coupling or quadratic Zeeman term by using the Bogoliubov approach. A few low-lying modes, which can be used to delineate the phase boundaries, are identified by exciting them with suitable perturbations. We also investigate the coarsening dynamics of a homogeneous quasi-two-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 condensate by quenching from the zero-momentum into the plane wave phase through a sudden change in Raman coupling strength. We demonstrate that the correlation function of the order parameter displays dynamic scaling during the late-time dynamics, allowing us to determine the dynamic critical exponent.

Title: Darkness in interlayer and charge density wave states of 2H-TaS2
Authors: Luigi Camerano, Dario Mastrippolito, Debora Pierucci, Ji Dai, Massimo Tallarida, Luca Ottaviano, Gianni Profeta, Federico Bisti
Abstract: The wave-like nature of electrons is evident from quantum interference effects observed during the photoemission process. When there are different nuclei in the unit cell of a crystal and/or structural distortions, photo-electron wavefunctions can interfere, giving rise to peculiar intensity modulation of the spectrum, which can also hide energy states in a photoemission experiment. The 2H phase of transition metal dichalcogenides, with two nonequivalent layers per unit cell and charge density wave distortion, is an optimal platform for such effects to be observed. Here, we discover undetectable states in 2H-TaS2, interpreting high-resolution angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy considering interference effects of the correlated electron wave functions. In addition, phase mismatching induced by the charge density wave distortion, results in evident signature of the phase transition in the photoemission spectrum. Our results highlight the importance of quantum interference, electronic correlations and structural distortion to understand the physics of layered materials.

Title: The effects of fibre spatial distribution and relative orientation on the percolation and mechanics of stochastic fibre networks: A model of peptide hydrogels
Authors: Amir Hossein Namdar, Nastaran Zoghi, Aline Miller, Alberto Saiani, Tom Shearer
Abstract: The structures of fibre networks can vary greatly due to fibre interactions during formation. We have modified the steps of generating Mikado networks to create two new model classes by altering the spatial distribution and relative orientation of their fibres to mimic the structures of self-assembling peptide hydrogels (SAPHs), whose physical properties depend strongly on their fibres' interactions. The results of our models and experiments on a set of beta-sheet forming SAPHs show that modifying a network's structure affects the percolation threshold and the mechanical behaviour of the material, both near percolation and at higher densities.

Title: Formulation of entropy through work by Carnot machine and direct derivation of law of entropy non-decrease from Kelvin-Planck principle
Authors: Yuki Izumida
Abstract: We derive the law of entropy non-decrease directly from the Kelvin-Planck principle for simple and compound systems without using the Clausius inequality. A key of the derivation is a formulation of entropy in terms of work by a Carnot machine operating between a system and a single heat reservoir, which is equivalent to Clausius entropy based on heat and Gyftopoulos-Beretta entropy based on work. We also characterize entropy as the thermodynamic cost to create from one state to another.

Title: Switchable Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Bogoliubov Modes
Authors: Hsuan Lo, You Wang, Rimi Banerjee, Baile Zhang, Y. D. Chong
Abstract: Interacting or nonlinear lattices can host emergent particle-like modes, such as Bogoliubov quasiparticles, whose band topology and other properties are potentially highly tunable. Despite originating in the study of superconducting materials, Bogoliubov quasiparticles can also occur in synthetic metamaterials. Here, we implement a nonlinear driven-dissipative circuit whose fluctuations are Bogoliubov modes possessing nontrivial non-Hermitian band topology. We show experimentally that the system exhibits a switchable non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which abruptly appears when the on-site driving voltage amplitude exceeds a threshold. In contrast to earlier realizations of the NHSE and related phenomena in circuit models, the switchable NHSE in our system occurs in Bogoliubov modes, which are strongly affected by how the system is driven. Moreover, unlike other experimental platforms hosting non-Hermitian Bogoliubov modes, our system does not contain unconventional asymmetric hopping nonlinearities, only a local Kerr-type nonlinearity.

Title: Gross-Neveu-Yukawa SO(2) and SO(3) tensorial criticality
Authors: SangEun Han, Shouryya Ray, Igor F. Herbut
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.

Title: Field-free Josephson diode effect in interacting chiral quantum dot junctions
Authors: Debika Debnath, Paramita Dutta
Abstract: We investigate chiral quantum dot (QD)-based Josephson junction and show the correlation-induced Josephson diode effect (JDE) in it. The presence of electron-electron interaction spontaneously creates an imbalance between up- and down-spin electrons during the non-equilibrium transport making the QD effectively magnetic. The simultaneous presence of the chirality and the interaction eventually results in the field-free JDE in our chiral QD junction. We employ the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function technique to study the behavior of the Josephson current (JC) and the rectification coefficient (RC) of our Josephson diode (JD). We show a sign-changing behavior of the RC with the Coulomb correlation and the lead-to-dot coupling strength and find the maximum magnitude of the RC $\sim 72\%$ for moderate interaction strength. Our proposed field-free JD based on interacting chiral QD may be a potential switching component in superconductor based devices.

Title: Redefining the dielectric response of nanoconfined liquids: insights from water
Authors: Jon Zubeltzu, Fernando Bresme, Matthew Dawber, Marivi Fernandez-Serra, Emilio Artacho
Abstract: Recent experiments show that the relative dielectric constant $\epsilon$ of water confined to a film of nanometric thickness reaches a strikingly low value of 2.1, barely above the bulk's 1.8 value for the purely electronic response. We argue that $\epsilon$ is not a well-defined measure for dielectric properties at sub-nanometer scales due to the ambiguous definition of confinement width. Instead we propose the 2D polarisability $\alpha_{\perp}$ as the appropriate, well-defined response function whose magnitude can be directly obtained from both measurements and computations. Once the appropriate description is used a very significant reduction, $\sim 30$\%, of the electronic response with respect to the bulk's is observed contrary to what widely assumed, highlighting the importance of electronic degrees of freedom to interpret the dielectric response of polar fluids under nanoconfinement conditions. This is obtained from molecular dynamics simulations.

Title: Thermodynamics, elastic anomalies and excitations in the field induced phases of CeRh2As2
Authors: Peter Thalmeier, Alireza Akbari, Burkhard Schmidt
Abstract: The tetragonal heavy fermion compound CeRh2As2 exhibits unconventional superconductivity accompanied by other broken symmetry phases that have been identified as presumably small moment intrinsic antiferromagnetism at low magnetic fields and induced quadrupolar order at higher in-plane fields. The latter may extend to very large pulsed-field range. The phase boundaries can be investigated by following thermodynamic anomalies like specific heat, magnetocaloric coefficient, thermal expansion and magnetostriction. We calculate their discontinuities and identify the influence of the field induced quadrupole on them. Furthermore we investigate the elastic constant anomalies which are determined by the static homogeneous quadrupolar RPA response functions. We present a calculation of these anomalies for the appropriate symmetry mode both in the disordered and ordered regime and investigate their change with applied field. In addition we consider the dynamical momentum dependent magnetic susceptibility and the associated dispersion of low energy magnetic modes and how their characteristics change across the phase boundary.

Title: Inverse Superconductor-Insulator Transition in Weakly Monitored Josephson Junction Arrays
Authors: Purnendu Das, Sumilan Banerjee
Abstract: Control and manipulation of quantum states by measurements and bath engineering in open quantum systems have emerged as new paradigms in many-body physics. Here, taking a prototypical example of Josephson junction arrays (JJAs), we show how repetitive monitoring through continuous weak measurements and feedback can transform an insulating state in these systems to a superconductor and vice versa. We show that, even in the absence of any external thermal bath, the monitoring leads to a long-time steady state characterized by an effective `quantum' temperature in a suitably defined semiclassical limit. However, we show that the quantum dissipation due to monitoring has fundamental differences with equilibrium quantum and/or thermal dissipation in the well-studied case of JJAs in contact with an Ohmic bath. In particular, using a variational approximation, and by considering various limiting cases, we demonstrate that this difference can give rise to re-entrant steady-state phase transitions, resulting in unusual inverse transition from an effective low-temperature insulating normal state to superconducting state at intermediate temperature. Our work emphasizes the role of quantum feedback, that acts as an additional knob to control the effective temperature of non-equilibrium steady state leading to a phase diagram, not explored in earlier works on monitored and open quantum systems.

Title: Non-Markovian Effects in Quantum Rate Calculations of Hydrogen Diffusion with Electronic Friction
Authors: George Trenins, Mariana Rossi
Abstract: We address the challenge of incorporating non-Markovian electronic friction effects in quantum-mechanical approximations of dynamical observables. A generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is formulated for ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate calculations, which combines electronic friction with a description of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) for adsorbates on metal surfaces. An efficient propagation algorithm is introduced that captures both the spatial dependence of friction strength and non-Markovian frictional memory. This framework is applied to a model of hydrogen diffusing on Cu(111) derived from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing significant alterations in rate constants and tunnelling crossover temperatures due to non-Markovian effects. Our findings explain why previous classical molecular dynamics simulations with Markovian friction showed unexpectedly good agreement with experiment, highlighting the critical role of non-Markovian effects in first-principles atomistic simulations.

Title: Bulk photovoltaic effects in altermagnets
Authors: Motohiko Ezawa
Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect is a photocurrent generation from alternating electric field, which is a promising candidate for future efficient solar cell technology. It is the second-order optical current, which is the injection current or the shift current. We focus on the direct current generation. By employing a simple two-band model of the $d$-wave altermagnet coupled with the Rashba interaction, we show that the linearly polarized light can generate the injection and shift currents when the Néel vector points to an in-plane direction. The magnitude of the injection current is almost constant over a wide range of the frequency $\omega $ of the applied light provided it is smaller than a certain critical frequency $\omega _{\text{c}}$ and larger than the bulk gap energy $\varepsilon _{\text{gap}}$, $\varepsilon _{\text{gap}}<\hbar \omega <\hbar \omega _{\text{c}}$. Hence, the use of the injection current is quite efficient for solar cell technology because any photon whose energy is within this range can be equally utilized.

Abstract: We report on an experimental study of spin and valley blockade in two-electron bilayer graphene (BLG) double quantum dots (DQDs) and explore the limits set by asymmetric orbitals and electronelectron interactions. The results obtained from magnetotransport measurements on two-electron BLG DQDs, where the resonant tunneling transport involves both orbital symmetric and antisymmetric two-particle states, show a rich level spectrum. We observe a magnetic field tunable spin and valley blockade, which is limited by the orbital splitting, the strength of the electron-electron interaction and the difference in the valley g-factors between the symmetric and antisymmetric twoparticle orbital states. Our conclusions are supported by simulations based on rate equations, which allow the identification of prominent interdot transitions associated with the transition from single to two-particle states observed in the experiment.

Title: Amorphous silicon structures generated using a moment tensor potential and the activation relaxation technique nouveau
Authors: Karim Zongo, Hao Sun, Claudiane Ouellet-Plamondon, Normand Mousseau, Laurent Karim Béland
Abstract: Preparing realistic atom-scale models of amorphous silicon (a-Si) is a decades-old condensed matter physics challenge. Herein, we combine the Activation Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) to a Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) to generate seven a-Si models containing between 216 and 4096 atoms. A thorough analysis of their short-range and medium-range structural properties is performed, alongside assessments of excess energy and mechanical properties. The seven ARTn-MTP models are compared with available experimental data and other high quality a-Si models present in the literature. The seven ARTn-MTP a-Si models are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. Notably, several of our models, including the 216-atom, 512-atom, and 1000-atom a-Si models, exhibit low coordination defects without any traces of crystalline grains. Historically overlooked in previous research, our study underlines the need to assess the validity of the continuous random-network hypothesis for the description of perfect amorphous model by characterizing local crystalline environment and to explore the crystallisation process of a-Si through modelling.

Title: Rheological response of soft Solid/Liquid Composites
Authors: Elina Gilbert, Christophe Poulard, Anniina Salonen
Abstract: Understanding a material's dissipative response is important for their use in many applications, such as adhesion. In dispersions the interplay between matrix and inclusions complicates any description. Fractional rheology is conveniently used to fit the storage and loss moduli of complex materials, although the physical picture is often elusive. We study the rheology of soft solid/liquid composites of liquid poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) droplets in a soft poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix. We analyze the influence of the droplets through fractional rheology and a time-concentration superposition. Viscous dissipation increases proportionally with volume fraction, and we show that a simple, well-fitting model can induce misinterpretation of the physics in a complex material.

Title: Dumbbell Fermions and Spin Models on Honeycomb Lattices
Authors: T. Banks
Abstract: We express Kitaev's exact solution of spin models on the honeycomb lattice as a special case of a higher dimensional duality between staggered Majorana fermions and Pauli spins. General models with bilinear nearest neighbor couplings of spins and external magnetic fields are soluble in this way. Each model gives rise to an infinite number of single particle fermion Schrodinger equations, depending on the choice of discrete gauge field flux.

Title: Anomalies of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetries
Authors: Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi, Carolyn Zhang
Abstract: Anomalies of global symmetries provide important information on the quantum dynamics. We show the dynamical constraints can be organized into three classes: genuine anomalies, fractional topological responses, and integer responses that can be realized in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Coset symmetry can be present in many physical systems including quantum spin liquids, and the coset symmetry can be a non-invertible symmetry. We introduce twists in coset symmetries, which modify the fusion rules and the generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. We call such coset symmetries twisted coset symmetries, and they are labeled by the quadruple $(G,K,\omega_{D+1},\alpha_D)$ in $D$ spacetime dimensions where $G$ is a group and $K\subset G$ is a discrete subgroup, $\omega_{D+1}$ is a $(D+1)$-cocycle for group $G$, and $\alpha_{D}$ is a $D$-cochain for group $K$. We present several examples with twisted coset symmetries using lattice models and field theory, including both gapped and gapless systems (such as gapless symmetry-protected topological phases). We investigate the anomalies of general twisted coset symmetry, which presents obstructions to realizing the coset symmetry in (gapped) symmetry-protected topological phases. We show that finite coset symmetry $G/K$ becomes anomalous when $G$ cannot be expressed as the bicrossed product $G=H\Join K$, and such anomalous coset symmetry leads to symmetry-enforced gaplessness in generic spacetime dimensions. We illustrate examples of anomalous coset symmetries with $A_5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, with realizations in lattice models.

Title: Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes
Authors: Ankit Singh, Vinay Vaibhav, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.

Title: Revealing Actual Viscoelastic Relaxation Times in Capillary Breakup
Authors: Nan Hu, Jonghyun Hwang, Tachin Ruangkriengsin, Howard A. Stone
Abstract: We use experiments and theory to elucidate the size effect in capillary breakup rheometry, where pre-stretching in the visco-capillary stage causes the apparent relaxation time to be consistently smaller than the actual value. We propose a method accounting for both the experimental size and the finite extensibility of polymers to extract the actual relaxation time. A phase diagram characterizes the expected measurement variability and delineates scaling law conditions. The results refine capillary breakup rheometry for viscoelastic fluids and advance the understanding of breakup dynamics across scales.

Title: Scaling laws of shrinkage induced fragmentation phenomena
Authors: Roland Szatmári, Akio Nakahara, So Kitsunezaki, Ferenc Kun
Abstract: We investigate the shrinkage induced breakup of thin layers of heterogeneous materials attached to a substrate, a ubiquitous natural phenomenon with a wide range of potential applications. Focusing on the evolution of the fragment ensemble, we demonstrate that the system has two distinct phases: damage phase, where the layer is cracked, however, a dominant piece persists retaining the structural integrity of the layer, and a fragmentation phase, where the layer disintegrates into numerous small pieces. Based on finite size scaling we show that the transition between the two phases occurs at a critical damage analogous to continuous phase transitions. At the critical point a fully connected crack network emerges whose structure is controlled by the strength of adhesion to the substrate. In the strong adhesion limit, damage arises from random microcrack nucleation, resembling bond percolation, while weak adhesion facilitates stress concentration and the growth of cracks to large extensions. The critical exponents of the damage to fragmentation transition agree to a reasonable accuracy with those of the two-dimensional Ising model. Our findings provide a novel insights into the mechanism of shrinkage-induced cracking revealing generic scaling laws of the phenomenon.

Title: BCS-like formula for $T_c$ does not necessarily imply BCS pairing mechanism
Authors: Yuxuan Wang, Andrey V. Chubukov
Abstract: In the BCS theory of superconductivity, an instability towards pairing develops at arbitrary weak dimensionless coupling $\lambda$ due to a divergence of logarithmic perturbative series for the pairing susceptibility (Cooper logarithms) at $T_c \sim \omega_0 e^{-1/\lambda}$, where $\omega_0$ is an energy cutoff. On the contrary, in many models of superconductivity out of a non-Fermi liquid, Cooper logarithm is absent and superconductivity emerges only when $\lambda$ exceeds a certain threshold. We argue that there are situations when there is no threshold and at weak coupling the formula for $T_c$ is BCS-like, yet the origin of the pairing instability is fundamentally different from that in the BCS scenario. As an example, we revisit superconductivity in a metal at the onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ spin-density-wave order. Earlier studies of this problem found no threshold and a BCS-like expression for $T_c$ at weak coupling. We argue that, despite this, the pairing is not caused by the Cooper logarithm and in many respects is qualitatively similar to that in non-Fermi liquids.

Title: Crystal field splittings and magnetic ground state of the square-lattice antiferromagnets YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 with Jeff = 1/2
Authors: Pyeongjae Park, Qianli Ma, G. Sala, S. Calder, Douglas L. Abernathy, Matthew B. Stone, Andrew F. May, Andrew D. Christianson
Abstract: We report on the crystal field level splitting and magnetic ground state of the Jeff = 1/2 square lattice antiferromagnets YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 using powder inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and neutron diffraction measurements. Both compounds exhibit a well-isolated $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet ground state under a tetragonal crystal field environment, confirming a robust Jeff = 1/2 picture with slight XY-type anisotropic character in the g-tensor. Notably, the ground state wave functions closely resemble the $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet expected in the perfect cubic limit, consistent with the nearly cubic ligand configuration of eight O2- ions surrounding Yb3+. Below TN =0.21 K, YbBi2IO4 exhibits a stripe long-range magnetic order characterized by an ordering wave vector qm = (1/2, 0, 0) or its symmetry-equivalent (0, 1/2, 0), with magnetic moments aligned along qm. The ordered moment is approximately 79 % of the classical prediction, significantly larger than expected from the isotropic J1-J2 model, suggesting the possible involvement of exchange anisotropy in explaining this observation. We show that symmetry-allowed XXZ and bond-dependent anisotropic exchange terms in a square lattice can play a critical role in stabilizing the stripe order and suppressing the moment reduction as observed. These findings establish YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 as unique platforms for exploring rich Jeff = 1/2 magnetism from two less investigated perspectives: (i) on a square lattice and (ii) within a (nearly) cubic ligand environment.

Title: Understanding phonon selection and interference in momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy
Authors: Thomas W. Pfeifer, Harrison A. Walker, Henry T. Aller, Samuel Graham, Sokrates Pantelides, Jordan A. Hachtel, Patrick E. Hopkins, Eric R. Hoglund
Abstract: As momentum-resolved Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (q-EELS) becomes more widely used for phonon measurements, better understanding of the intricacies of the acquired signal becomes necessary. Selection rules limit the allowed scattering directions, which may prohibit the appearance of specific phonon branches, and features may appear with no clear explanation. To explore both, we perform frequency-resolved q-EELS simulations via the multislice method and compare results to Spectral Energy Density (SED) and Lattice Dynamics (LD) calculations. We discuss common misconceptions of phonon behavior and characterization generally and in the context of measured or simulated q-EELS signals. We highlight the presence of an ``interferometric Brillouin zone'' (closely related to the Dynamic Structure Factor), resulting from the simultaneous sampling of the lattice across each basis index. We also demonstrate the scattering selection rules on well-studied systems and explore the acquisition of a polarization-selective signal based on this phenomena. Finally, we identify thickness-dependent sensitivity effects, where the upper surface of a film is sampled at a disproportionate level. We show that this can yield sensitivity to through-plane vibrational modes, which may be measured experimentally assuming sufficient sensitivity can be achieved. Our work should serve as a road map to guide momentum-resolved vibrational EELS measurements in the future, particularly as ever-increasing energy and momentum resolution becomes available.

Title: A Jammed Parisi Ansatz
Authors: Michael Winer, Aidan Herderschee
Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems are ubiquitous in fields ranging from the physics of solids to artificial intelligence. In many cases, such systems undergo a transition when the ratio of constraints to variables reaches some value $\alpha_{\textrm{crit}}$. Above this critical value, it is exponentially unlikely that all constraints can be mutually satisfied. We calculate the probability that constraints can all be satisfied, $P(\textrm{SAT})$, for the spherical perceptron. Traditional replica methods, such as the Parisi ansatz, fall short. We find a new ansatz, the jammed Parisi ansatz, that correctly describes the behavior of the system in this regime. With the jammed Parisi ansatz, we calculate $P(\textrm{SAT})$ for the first time and match previous computations of thresholds. We anticipate that the techniques developed here will be applicable to general constraint satisfaction problems and the identification of hidden structures in data sets.

Title: Extended Fractional Chern Insulators Near Half Flux in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Above the Magic Angle
Authors: Joe Finney, Aaron L. Sharpe, Linsey K. Rodenbach, Jian Kang, Xiaoyu Wang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Marc A. Kastner, Oskar Vafek, David Goldhaber-Gordon
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) -- the lattice analog of the fractional quantum Hall states -- form as fractionalized quasiparticles emerge in a partially-filled Chern band. This fractionalization is driven by an interplay of electronic interaction and quantum geometry of the underlying wavefunctions. Bilayer graphene with an interlayer twist near the magic angle of 1.1° hosts diverse correlated electronic states at zero magnetic field. When the twist angle exceeds 1.3°, the electronic bandwidth is sufficient to suppress the zero-field correlated states. Yet applying a magnetic field can restore the importance of electron-electron interactions. Here, we report strongly-correlated phases when a 1.37° twisted bilayer graphene sample is tuned to near half a magnetic flux quantum per moiré cell, deep into the Hofstadter regime. Most notably, well-quantized odd-denominator FCI states appear in multiple Hofstadter subbands, over unusually large ranges of density. This suggests a mechanism beyond disorder is stabilizing the fractional states. We also observe a bending and resetting of the Landau minifan reminiscent of the cascade of Dirac resets observed in magic-angle samples near integer filling at zero field.

Title: Slow Oscillations of the Transverse Magnetoresistance in HoTe3
Authors: S. V. Zaitsev-Zotov, P. D. Grigoriev, D. Voropaev, A. A. Morocho, I. A. Cohn, E. Pachoud, A. Hadj-Azzem, P. Monceau
Abstract: Slow oscillations of the magnetoresistance periodic in the inverse magnetic field with a frequency of 3.4 T have been identified in HoTe3. The temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude is close to exponential even at low temperatures. This may be attributed to the existence of soft modes in the system and allows the estimation of the electron scattering rate on these modes. In the region of magnetic fields exceeding 1 T, the oscillations can be described as interference oscillations associated with the splitting of the band structure due to the bilayer structure of HoTe3. The obtained data have allowed us to calculate the ratio tb/tz~7.7 of the hopping integrals between layers within each bilayer (tb) and between the adjacent bilayers (tz) to estimate these integrals as tb ~ 2 meV and tz ~ 0.26 meV.

Title: Interaction tuned pattern-selective superconductivity: Application to the dodecagonal quasicrystal
Authors: Junmo Jeon, SungBin Lee
Abstract: Quasicrystals exhibit superconductivity under the unique interplay of long-range order and strong inhomogeneity, distinguishing them from both crystalline and amorphous systems. Understanding how this structural complexity affects superconducting states and phase transitions remains an important open question. Here, we unveil anomalous superconductivity in a dodecagonal quasicrystal using the attractive Hubbard model within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework. We show that both the gap structure and critical temperature depend on the local pattern due to inhomogeneous charge distribution and kinetic terms. This leads to unconventional phase transitions between mixed phases where superconducting and normal metal regions coexist, even without external fields, which we term pattern-selective superconductivity. Furthermore, superconductivity can be anomalously suppressed even under stronger attractive interactions due to the alignment of the Fermi level with a spectral gap in the fragmented Hartree-shifted spectrum. These findings, not observed in conventional crystals, amorphous systems, or previous studies of quasicrystal superconductivity, highlight the distinct role of quasicrystalline order.

Title: The Energy Barrier of Precritical Nuclei in Hard Spheres is Consistent with Predictions
Authors: Lars Kürten, Antoine Castagnède, Frank Smallenburg, C. Patrick Royall
Abstract: Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on the origins of this discrepancy due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy. Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of \emph{pre--critical} nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been directly compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.

Title: Bounds on the rates of statistical divergences and mutual information via stochastic thermodynamics
Authors: Jan Karbowski
Abstract: Statistical divergences are important tools in data analysis, information theory, and statistical physics, and there exist well known inequalities on their bounds. However, in many circumstances involving temporal evolution, one needs limitations on the rates of such quantities, instead. Here, several general upper bounds on the rates of some f-divergences are derived, valid for any type of stochastic dynamics (both Markovian and non-Markovian), in terms of information-like and/or thermodynamic observables. As special cases, the analytical bounds on the rate of mutual information are obtained. The major role in all those limitations is played by temporal Fisher information, characterizing the speed of global system dynamics, and some of them contain entropy production, suggesting a link with stochastic thermodynamics. Indeed, the derived inequalities can be used for estimation of minimal dissipation and global speed in thermodynamic stochastic systems. Specific applications of these inequalities in physics and neuroscience are given, which include the bounds on the rates of free energy and work in nonequilibrium systems, limits on the speed of information gain in learning synapses, as well as the bounds on the speed of predictive inference and learning rate. Overall, the derived bounds can be applied to any complex network of interacting elements, where predictability and thermodynamics of network dynamics are of prime concern.

Title: Anomalous size effects with fixed criticality in bistable flexible mechanical metamaterials
Authors: Zehuan Tang, Tingfeng Ma, Boyue Su, Qing Xia, Pengfei Kang, Bowei Wu
Abstract: When the structure deformation is dominated by the low-energy deformation mode, the structure hardens with the increase in the size (number of units) at small sizes. This anomalous behavior will eventually disappear with the decay length of the finite structure converging to a size-independent characteristic quantity, but the specific critical point at which the anomalous behavior disappears still cannot be accurately and concisely described. Here, under two steady states of the bistable chain, we observe anomalous size effects with constant and oscillating criticality (the proportion of inhomogeneous deformation), two criticalities exactly separate the increasing and decreasing intervals of stiffness variation. They are interrelated because of the implied symmetries between the two steady states, on the other hand, they are distinguished because of the opposite superposition mode under the two steady states. Specifically, the constant criticality corresponds to the anomalous size effect achieved by the competition mechanism, while the oscillating criticality reveals an anomalous size effect achieved by the new mechanism (cancellation mechanism). In the anomalous size effect achieved by the cancellation mechanism, the singular characteristics generated by the completely cancelled deformation make it very robust. This robustness reflects in that the anomalous effects are no longer limited to linear small deformation, but it can still be observed stably in nonlinear large deformation. Our study reinterprets the anomalous size effect at a quantitative level, and the proposed cancellation mechanism expands the possible application range of this anomalous effect.

Title: Exponential mixing of all orders for Arnol'd cat map lattices
Authors: Minos Axenides, Emmanuel Floratos, Stam Nicolis
Abstract: We show that the recently introduced classical Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories, which are chaotic, are exponentially mixing to all orders. Their mixing times are well-defined and are expressed in terms of the Lyapunov exponents, more precisely by the combination that defines the inverse of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of these systems. We prove by an explicit recursive construction of correlation functions, that these exhibit $l-$fold mixing for any $l= 3,4,5,\ldots$. This computation is relevant for Rokhlin's conjecture, which states that 2-fold mixing induces $l-$fold mixing for any $l>2$. Our results show that 2-fold exponential mixing, while being necessary for any $l-$fold mixing to hold it is nevertheless not sufficient for Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories.

Title: Quantum reservoir probing of quantum phase transitions
Authors: Kaito Kobayashi, Yukitoshi Motome
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are highly remarkable phenomena manifesting in quantum many-body systems. However, their precise identifications in equilibrium systems pose significant theoretical and experimental challenges. Thus far, dynamical detection protocols employing global quantum quenches have been proposed, wherein transitions are discerned via global nonequilibrium excitations. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum phase transitions can be detected through localized out-of-equilibrium excitations induced by local quantum quenches. While the resulting dynamics after the quench is influenced by both the local quench operation and the intrinsic dynamics of the quantum system, the effects of the former are exclusively extracted using the cutting-edge framework called quantum reservoir probing (QRP). Through the QRP, we find that the impacts of the local quenches vary across different quantum phases and are significantly suppressed by quantum fluctuations amplified near quantum critical points; consequently, phase boundaries are precisely delineated. We demonstrate that the QRP can detect quantum phase transitions in the paradigmatic integrable and nonintegrable quantum spin systems, and even topological quantum phase transitions, all within the identical framework employing local quantum quenches and single-site observables.

Title: Deriving the non-perturbative gravitational dual of quantum Liouville theory from BCFT operator algebra
Authors: Lin Chen, Ling-Yan Hung, Yikun Jiang, Bing-Xin Lao
Abstract: We demonstrate that, by utilizing the boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) operator algebra of the Liouville CFT, one can express its path-integral on any Riemann surface as a three dimensional path-integral with appropriate boundary conditions, generalising the recipe for rational CFTs \cite{Hung:2019bnq, Brehm:2021wev, Chen:2022wvy, Cheng:2023kxh}. This serves as a constructive method for deriving the \textit{quantum} holographic dual of the CFT, which reduces to Einstein gravity in the large central charge limit. As a byproduct, the framework provides an explicit discrete state-sum of a 3D non-chiral topological theory constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(sl(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, representing a long-sought non-perturbative discrete formulation of 3D pure gravity with negative cosmological constant, at least within a class of three manifolds. This constitutes the first example of an exact holographic tensor network that reproduces a known irrational CFT with a precise quantum gravitational interpretation.

Title: Long-range multipartite entanglement near measurement-induced transitions
Authors: Sebastien J Avakian, T. Pereg-Barnea, William Witczak-Krempa
Abstract: Measurements profoundly impact quantum systems, and can be used to create novel states of matter out of equilibrium. We investigate the multipartite entanglement structure that emerges in hybrid quantum circuits involving unitaries and measurements. We describe how a balance between measurements and unitary evolution can lead to multipartite entanglement spreading to distances far greater than what is found in non-monitored systems, thus evading the usual fate of entanglement. We introduce a graphical representation based on spanning graphs that allows to infer the evolution of genuine multipartite entanglement for general subregions. We exemplify our findings on hybrid random Haar circuits that realize a 1d measurement-induced dynamical phase transition, where we find genuine 3-party entanglement at all separations. At criticality, our data is consistent with power-law decay with a tripartite exponent strictly larger than the one of the bipartite logarithmic negativity. The 4-party case is also explored. Finally, we discuss how our approach can provide fundamental insights regarding entanglement dynamics for a wide class of quantum circuits and architectures.

Title: Transitionless Quantum Driving of the Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid
Authors: Léonce Dupays, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) make the fast preparation of many-body states possible, circumventing the limitations of adiabatic strategies. We propose a fast STA protocol for generating interacting states in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by counter-diabatic driving, stirring the dynamics with an auxiliary control field. To this end, we exploit the equivalence between the time-dependent Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and an ensemble of quantum oscillators with driven mass and frequency. We specify the closed-form expression of the counterdiabatic control and demonstrate its efficiency in suppressing excitations.

Title: Glassy dynamics in deep neural networks: A structural comparison
Authors: Max Kerr Winter, Liesbeth M. C. Janssen
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) share important similarities with structural glasses. Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with exponent $\approx -0.5$, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.

Title: Lumos Extrema
Authors: Upamanyu Moitra
Abstract: We consider trajectories of massless particles in the presence of charged black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions. We study the properties of the photon ring in the (near-)extremal limit and show that the photon ring can probe the near-horizon region in two different scenarios: in high enough number of spacetime dimensions or when the massless particle carries an electric charge. We propose a simple $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription for implementing the JWKB approximation and show its utility in various contexts. We calculate the quasi-normal modes for charged fields in the eikonal limit and show the emergence of a new time-scale of relaxation in the dual field theory side. In the near-extremal limit, we show generally that the time-scale of decay of the perturbations is governed by the chemical potential. We also verify our analytical results numerically. The $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription allows us to study the superradiant modes and the associated instabilities in the eikonal limit easily. We comment on some related aspects regarding near-extremal black holes.

Title: Unifying theory of scaling in drop impact: Forces & maximum spreading diameter
Authors: Vatsal Sanjay, Detlef Lohse
Abstract: The dynamics of drop impact on a rigid surface -- omnipresent in nature and technology -- strongly depends on the droplet's velocity, its size, and its material properties. The main characteristics are the droplet's force exerted on the surface and its maximal spreading radius. The crucial question is: How do they depend on the (dimensionless) control parameters, which are the Weber number $We$ (non-dimensionalized kinetic energy) and the Ohnesorge number $Oh$ (dimensionless viscosity)? Here we perform direct numerical simulations over the huge parameter range $1\le We \le 10^3$ and $10^{-3}\le Oh \le 10^2$ and in particular develop a unifying theoretical approach, which is inspired by the Grossmann-Lohse theory for wall-bounded turbulence [J. Fluid Mech. 407, 27 (2000); PRL 86, 3316 (2001)]. The key idea is to split the energy dissipation rate into the different phases of the impact process, in which different physical mechanisms dominate. The theory can consistently and quantitatively account for the $We$ and $Oh$ dependences of the maximal impact force and the maximal spreading diameter over the huge parameter space. It also clarifies why viscous dissipation plays a significant role during impact, even for low-viscosity droplets (low $Oh$), in contrast to what had been assumed in prior theories.

Title: Multicomponent Fermi systems at low densities
Authors: C.J. Pethick, A. Schwenk
Abstract: We calculate, to second order in the scattering length between two fermions, the Landau quasiparticle interaction for a low-density mixture of two fermion species with unequal densities at temperature zero. From the Landau parameters we evaluate the energy density and find agreement with the result of Kanno, Prog. Theor. Phys. 44, 813 (1970). The calculations are then extended to the case of two fermion components with different total densities, each with two spin components, a situation of interest in nuclear physics and astrophysics, where the species are neutrons and protons. An interesting finding is that, for low proton concentrations, $x \ll 1$, the leading term in the energy density, beyond the $x^{5/3}$ contribution from the kinetic energy and the $x^2$ one due to the two-body interaction in the mean-field approximation, varies as $x^{7/3} \ln x$. This is to be contrasted with the higher powers of $x$ implicit in many phenomenological energy-density functionals employed in nuclear physics, such as those of the Skyrme type.

Title: On Chord Dynamics and Complexity Growth in Double-Scaled SYK
Authors: Jiuci Xu
Abstract: We study the time evolution governed by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in the double-scaled SYK model, which induces a probability distribution over operators in the double-scaled algebra. Through the bulk-to-boundary map, this distribution translates into dynamical profiles of bulk states within the chord Hilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for such profiles, valid across a broad parameter range and all time scales. Additionally, we demonstrate how distinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific energy regions in the semi-classical limit. We revisit the doubled Hilbert space formalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord Hilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Utilizing this map, we obtain analytic results for correlation functions and investigate the dynamical evolution for chord operators. Specifically, we establish an equivalence between the chord number generating function in presence of matter chords and the crossed four-point correlation function, the latter is closely related to the $6j$-symbol of $U_{\sqrt{q}}(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$. We also explore finite-temperature effects, showing that operator spreading slows as temperature decreases. In the semi-classical limit, we perform a saddle point analysis and incorporate the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized time-ordered four-point correlation function at infinite temperature. The leading correction reproduces the \(1/N\) connected contribution observed in the large-\(p\) SYK model. Finally, we examine the time evolution of total chord number in presence of matter in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to the renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.

Title: Near linearity of the macroscopic Hall current response in infinitely extended gapped fermion systems
Authors: Marius Wesle, Giovanna Marcelli, Tadahiro Miyao, Domenico Monaco, Stefan Teufel
Abstract: We consider an infinitely extended system of fermions on a $d$-dimensional lattice with (magnetic) translation-invariant short-range interactions. We further assume that the system has a locally unique gapped ground state. Physically, this is a model for the bulk of a generic topological insulator at zero temperature, and we are interested in the current response of such a system to a constant external electric field. Using the non-equilibrium almost-stationary states approach, we prove that the longitudinal current density induced by a constant electric field of strength $\varepsilon$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, i.e. the system is an insulator in the usual sense. For the Hall current density we show instead that it is linear in $\varepsilon$ up to terms of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$. The proportionality factor $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is by definition the Hall conductivity, and we show that it is given by a generalization of the well known double commutator formula to interacting systems. As a by-product of our results, we find that the Hall conductivity is constant within gapped phases, and that for $d=2$ the relevant observable that "measures" the Hall conductivity in experiments, the Hall conductance, not only agrees with $\sigma_{\mathrm{H}}$ in expectation up to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, but also has vanishing variance. A notable difference to several existing results on the current response in interacting fermion systems is that we consider a macroscopic system exposed to a small constant electric field, rather than to a small voltage drop.

Title: Picocavity-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of physisorbed H2 and D2 molecules
Authors: Akitoshi Shiotari, Shuyi Liu, George Trenins, Toshiki Sugimoto, Martin Wolf, Mariana Rossi, Takashi Kumagai
Abstract: We report on tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) of H2 and D2 molecules physisorbed within a plasmonic picocavity at 10 K. The intense Raman peaks resulting from the rotational and vibrational transitions are observed at sub-nanometer gap distances of the junction formed by an Ag tip and Ag(111) surface, where a picocavity-enhanced field plays a crucial role. A significant red-shift of the H-H stretch frequency is found as the gap distance decreases, while the D-D stretch frequency is unaffected. Density functional theory, path-integral molecular dynamics, and quantum anharmonic vibrational energy calculations suggest that this unexpected isotope effect is explained by a different molecular density between H2 and D2 on the surface.

Title: Dielectric waveguide setup tested with a superconducting millimeter-wave Fabry-Pérot interferometer at milli-Kelvin temperatures
Authors: Jakob Lenschen (1), Rosalie Labbe (1), Nils Drotleff (1), Markus Fuhrmann (1), Jürgen Lisenfeld (1), Hannes Rotzinger (1 and 2), Alexey V. Ustinov (1 and 2) ((1) Physiklalisches Institut, Karlsruher Institut für Technologie, (2) Institut für Quantenmaterialien und Technologie, Karlsruher Institut für Technologie)
Abstract: We propose and test a cryogenic setup comprising dielectric waveguides for mm-wave frequencies in the range of 75-110 GHz and temperatures down to 10 mK. The targeted applications are quantum technologies at millimeter-wave frequencies, which require measurements at low photon numbers and noise. We show that the high density polyethylene waveguides combine a frequency independent low photon loss with a very low heat conductance. Black high density polyethylene shows a higher attenuation, which is useful to block thermal photons in a cryogenic environment. The dielectric waveguides are thermally anchored and attenuated at several stages of the cryostat. They are individually protected by additional metallic shields to suppress mutual cross-talk and external interference. With this setup, multiple superconducting resonances of a Fabry-Pérot cavity were measured at 10 mK. We find quality factors up to 15 million in the single photon limit for resonances above 100 GHz. These results show no evident influence of atomic two-level systems in the cavity.

Title: Onset of wavenumber bandgaps via alternating Willis coupling signs
Authors: Hasan B. Al Ba'ba'a
Abstract: This article introduces a methodology for inducing wavenumber bandgaps via alternating Willis coupling signs. A non-reciprocal wave equation of Willis-type is first considered, and its wave dispersion analyses are carried out via the transfer matrix method. By creating unit cells from two identical Willis-type elastic layers, yet with reversed Willis-coupling signs, a reciprocal band structure peculiarly emerges, although each layer exhibits non-reciprocity if considered individually. Wavenumber bandgaps open due to such unit cell configuration, and their width and limits are analytically quantified. Similarities between materials with reversed-sign Willis coupling and bi-layered phononic crystals are noted, followed by concluding remarks.

Title: Material instability and subsequent restabilization from homogenization of periodic elastic lattices
Authors: Davide Bigoni, Andrea Piccolroaz
Abstract: Two classes of non-linear elastic materials are derived via two-dimensional homogenization. These materials are equivalent to a periodic grid of axially-deformable and axially-preloaded structural elements, subject to incremental deformations that involve bending, shear, and normal forces. The unit cell of one class is characterized by elements where deformations are lumped within a finite-degrees-of-freedom framework. In contrast, the other class involves smeared deformation, modelled as flexurally deformable rods with sufficiently high axial compliance. Under increasing compressive load, the elasticity tensor of the equivalent material loses positive definiteness and subsequently undergoes an ellipticity loss. Remarkably, in certain conditions, this loss of stability is followed by a subsequent restabilization; that is, the material re-enters the elliptic regime and even the positive definiteness domain and simultaneously, the underlying elastic lattice returns to a stable state. This effect is closely related to the axial compliance of the elements. Our results: (i.) demonstrate new possibilities for exploiting structural elements within the elastic range, characterized by a finite number of degrees of freedom, to create architected materials with tuneable instabilities, (ii.) introduce reconfigurable materials characterized by 'islands' of stability or instability.

Title: A relativistic continuous matrix product state study of field theories with defects
Authors: Karan Tiwana, Edoardo Lauria, Antoine Tilloy
Abstract: We propose a method to compute expectation values in 1+1-dimensional massive Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) with line defects using Relativistic Continuous Matrix Product State (RCMPS). Exploiting Euclidean invariance, we use a quantization scheme where (imaginary) time runs perpendicularly to the defect. With this choice, correlation functions of local operators in the presence of the defect can be computed as expectation values of extended operators in the no-defect vacuum, which can be approximated by a homogeneous RCMPS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this machinery by computing correlation functions of local bulk and defect operators in $\phi^4$ theory with a magnetic line defect, in perturbative, strong coupling, critical, and symmetry-broken regimes.

Title: Stability of the $π$-Flux Phase for $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Lattice Gauge Theory Coupled to Fermionic Matter
Authors: Leonardo Goller, Marcello Porta
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Ising gauge theory coupled to fermionic matter. In absence of electric fields, we prove that, at half-filling, the ground state of the gauge theory coincides with the $\pi$-flux phase, associated with magnetic flux equal to $\pi$ in every elementary lattice plaquette, provided the fermionic hopping is large enough. This proves in particular the semimetallic behavior of the ground state of the model. Furthermore, we compute the magnetic susceptibility of the gauge theory, and we prove that it is given by the one of massless $2d$ Dirac fermions, thus rigorously justifying recent numerical computations. The proof is based on reflection positivity and chessboard estimates, and on lattice conservation laws for the computation of the transport coefficient.

Title: Symmetries of Living Systems: Symmetry Fibrations and Synchronization in Biological Networks
Authors: Hernan A. Makse, Paolo Boldi, Francesco Sorrentino, Ian Stewart
Abstract: A symmetry is a `change without change'. As simple as it sounds, this concept is the fundamental cornerstone that unifies all branches of theoretical physics. Virtually all physical laws -- ranging from classical mechanics and electrodynamics to relativity, quantum mechanics, and the standard model -- can be expressed in terms of symmetry invariances. In this book, we explore whether the same principle can also explain the emergent laws of biological systems. We introduce a new geometry for biological networks and AI architectures, drawing inspiration from the mystic genius of Grothendieck's fibrations in category theory. We attempt to bridge the gap between physics and biology using symmetries but with a twist. The traditional symmetry groups of physics are global and too rigid to describe biology. Instead, the novel notion of symmetry fibration is local, flexible, and adaptable to evolutionary pressures, providing the right framework for understanding biological complexity. In other words, this more general symmetry invariance is necessary and sufficient to ensure that a given biological network configuration can support a synchronized function. In this book, we review the theoretical progress over the last decades from mathematics, physics, computer science, dynamical systems, and graph theory that has led to the discovery of symmetry fibrations in biological networks. These symmetries act as organizing principles for biological networks. They serve as effective tools for describing the structure of these networks, blending geometry and topology. Fibrations explain how structure dictates function across various biological domains, including the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome. Additionally, they facilitate a reduction in the dimensionality of the network, simplifying it into its fundamental building blocks for biological computation.

Title: Digital Simulation of Non-Abelian Parafermions in Superconducting Circuits
Authors: Hong-Yu Wang, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana fermions, exhibit profound non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding statistics of parafermion modes, and show the application of this approach to fusing and braiding the $d=3$ parafermions. We also examine the experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulation for twist defects in SC qubits to qudit systems, and may open up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.

Title: Holographic study of shear viscosity and butterfly velocity for magnetic field-driven quantum criticality
Authors: Jun-Kun Zhao, Li Li
Abstract: We investigate the shear viscosity and butterfly velocity of a magnetic field-induced quantum phase transition in five dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, which is holographically dual to a class of strongly coupled quantum field theories with chiral anomalies. Our analysis reveals that the ratio of longitudinal shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta_\parallel/s$ exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic dependence on temperature $T$ when the magnetic field $B$ is slightly below the critical value $B_c$ of the quantum phase transition. In particular, it can develop a distinct minimum at an intermediate temperature. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic temperature scaling observed at and above $B_c$, where $\eta_\parallel/s$ follows the scaling $T^{2/3}$ at $B=B_c$ and transitions to $T^2$ for $B>B_c$ as $T\to0$. The non-vanishing of $\eta_\parallel/s$ for $B<B_c$ in the zero temperature limit suggests that it could serve as a good order parameter of the quantum phase transition. We also find that all butterfly velocities change dramatically near the quantum phase transition, and thus their derivatives with respect to $B$ can be independently used to detect the quantum critical point.

Title: Singular Value Decomposition and Its Blind Spot for Quantum Chaos in Non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models
Authors: Matteo Baggioli, Kyoung-Bum Huh, Hyun-Sik Jeong, Xuhao Jiang, Keun-Young Kim, Juan F. Pedraza
Abstract: The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we show that SVD fails to reproduce conventional eigenvalue statistics in the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, as exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.

Title: Highly efficient exciton-exciton annihilation in single conjugated polymer chains
Authors: Nicola J. Fairbairn, Olga Vodianova, Gordon J. Hedley
Abstract: The number of excitons that conjugated polymers can support at any one time underpins their optoelectronic performance in light emitting diodes and as laser gain media, as it sets a natural limit on exciton density. Here we have measured the time-resolved photon statistics of single chains of polyfluorene to extract the absolute number of independent emitting sites present and its time dependence. We find that after 100 ps each chain can only support 1 or 2 independent excitons, and that even at the earliest times this number rises only to 4, suggesting a high degree of electronic coupling between chromophores that facilitates efficient exciton-exciton annihilation. In circumstances where a low density of low-energy sites is present, annihilation between them still dominates. The results indicate that achieving high exciton densities in conjugated polymers is difficult, and in applications where it is desirable new strategies should be devised to control exciton-exciton annihilation.

Title: Current and quantum transport factor of fermionic system in fermionic bath
Authors: Jayarshi Bhattacharya, Gautam Gangopadhyay, Sunandan Gangopadhyay
Abstract: This paper explores the dynamics of current and the quantum transport factor in a fermionic system with a central oscillator interacting with two fermionic reservoirs at different temperatures. We derive the master equation for the system density matrix, accounting for energy exchange between the system and the reservoirs. The current is analyzed in relation to system parameters and reservoir temperatures, revealing that the quantum transport factor differs from classical systems, approaching Carnot efficiency at high temperatures but being different at low temperatures. We also examine the power spectrum of the current, providing insights into current fluctuations and their temperature dependence. Furthermore, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation and the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation, where the steady-state probability distribution takes a Gaussian form, confirming the system behaves like a harmonic oscillator. This work advances the understanding of quantum transport in fermionic systems and provides a foundation for future research in quantum thermodynamics.

Title: Noise equals endogenous control
Authors: Eric De Giuli
Abstract: Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of endogenous control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, control is optimal and an exact mathematical mapping from noise to control is described, where the maximizing the probability of a state becomes the control objective. In Langevin dynamics noise is identified directly with control, while in general Markov jump processes, which include chemical reaction networks and electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Zel'dovich-Grassberger-Goldenfeld-Peliti path integral to identify the `response' or `tilt' field $\pi$ as control, which is proportional to the noise in the semiclassical limit. This solves the longstanding problem of interpreting $\pi$. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks and systems with unstable fixed points. The noise-control mapping builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why the probability is generically a non-smooth function of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agentic behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.
