Title: Seamlessly joining length scales: From atomistic thermal graphs to anisotropic continuum conductivity
Authors: C. Ugwumadu, D. A. Drabold, R. M. Tutchton
Abstract: Thermal transport in complex solids is governed by local structure, defects, and anisotropy, yet most continuum models still rely on oversimplified, homogenized conductivities. Here, we bridge atomistic and continuum descriptions by building finite element (FE) models directly from the site-projected thermal conductivity (SPTC), an atomic-level decomposition of the Green-Kubo thermal conductivity. We introduce a new toolkit, the Simulator Collection for Atomic-to-Continuum Scales (SCACS), which uses a graph neural network to predict SPTC on large atomic structures, coarse-grain these fields into anisotropic conductivity tensors, and embeds them into the heat-flow FE equation with a customized, anisotropy-aware adaptive mesh refinement scheme. Applied to silicon nanostructures, the resulting FE models act as representative volume elements, reproduce bulk conductivities, and capture interfacial and defect-driven anisotropy while maintaining thermodynamic consistency. Additionally, SCACS predicts experimental conductance trends and fields. This innovation demonstrates a novel and general route for transferring atomistic transport information into device-scale thermal simulations with physics-based approximations.

Title: Phononic enhancement and detection of hidden spin-nematicity and dynamics in quantum magnets
Authors: Junyu Tang, Hong-hao Song, Gang v. Chen
Abstract: The spin nematic phase, characterized by long-range order of spin quadrupole moments in the absence of dipolar magnetism, presents a significant challenge for conventional experimental detection. We propose a novel method to detect this elusive order in quantum magnets with an illustration in the spin-1 triangular lattice Mott insulator. By integrating out the phonon degrees of freedom, we obtain a phase diagram with substantially enlarged regions for the spin-nematic and spin-nematic-supersolid phases. We then demonstrate that through the spin-lattice coupling, the emergence of spin nematic order imprints a distinctive signature onto the phonon spectra, providing a clear spectroscopic signature for the quadrupolar order accessible via Raman or inelastic X-ray scattering. Our formalism offers a direct and powerful method to uncover the hidden spin nematicity, opening a new pathway for diagnosing multipolar orders in quantum magnets.

Title: Atomic-Scale Quantum Control of Single Spin Defects in a Two-Dimensional Semiconductor
Authors: Kwan Ho Au-Yeung, Wantong Huang, Johanna Matusche, Paul Greule, Jonas Arnold, Lovis Hardeweg, Máté Stark, Luise Renz, Affan Safeer, Daniel Jansen, Thomas Michely, Jeison Fischer, Wolfgang Wernsdorfer, Christoph Sürgers, Hannu-Pekka Komsa, Johannes Schwenk, Wouter Jolie, Philip Willke
Abstract: Individual spin defects in solids are promising building blocks for quantum technologies, but their deterministic creation, individual addressability, and operation near surfaces remain major challenges. Two-dimensional materials provide an attractive alternative, as their single-layer thickness enables direct atomic-scale access to defect states. Here, we demonstrate single-spin control of solid-state defects in a two-dimensional semiconductor by a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance. We create and manipulate individual sulfur vacancies and carbon substitution defects in monolayer molybdenum disulfide and characterize their spin dynamics, including coherent control, at the single-defect level. Using atomic manipulation, we further engineer and probe spin-spin interactions between defect pairs. Our results demonstrate deterministic creation, addressability, coherent manipulation, and controlled coupling of individual spin defects within a single experimental platform. This establishes atomically engineered spin defects in two-dimensional semiconductors as a versatile class of controllable solid-state quantum systems and opens a route towards tailored quantum sensing experiments.

Title: Tuning the magnetic properties of Kitaev materials via the antiferromagnetic proximity effect: Novel phases and application to an $α$-RuCl$_3$/MnPS$_3$ bilayer
Authors: Pedro M. Cônsoli, Ezra Day-Roberts, Johannes Knolle, Antia S. Botana, Onur Erten
Abstract: In recent years, the increasing level of control over van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures has opened new routes to tune the properties of quantum materials. Motivated by these developments, we examine the potential consequences of interfacing a Kitaev honeycomb magnet, such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, with a nearly lattice-matched vdW antiferromagnet. By combining perturbation theory, exact diagonalization, and a classical energy-minimization method, we show that an effective staggered magnetic field originating from the vdW antiferromagnet can drive a monolayer of a Kitaev material into various novel phases, including an antichiral Kitaev spin liquid, a nonmagnetic nematic phase, and different types of skyrmion crystals. We then apply first-principle simulations to assess the prospect of concretely realizing this setup in a heterobilayer of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and the easy-axis antiferromagnet MnPS$_3$.

Title: Inhomogeneous superconductivity in (001), (110) and (111) KTaO$_3$ two-dimensional electronic gas: $T_c$ driven from electronic confinement
Authors: Matta Trama, Roberta Citro, Carmine Antonio Perroni
Abstract: We investigate superconductivity in KTaO$_3$ (KTO)-based two-dimensional electron gases for the (001), (110), and (111) crystallographic orientations within a unified microscopic framework. Using a self-consistent tight-binding slab model, we determine the confinement potential, electronic structure, and orbital composition for each orientation, explicitly including inversion-symmetry-induced orbital Rashba couplings. Using a local spin-singlet s-wave pairing interaction, we find that the pronounced orientation dependence of the superconducting critical temperature primarily originates from differences in the spatial extent of the two-dimensional electron gas and the associated redistribution of the density of states at the Fermi level, rather than from changes in the pairing interaction. Our results provide a microscopic explanation for the experimentally observed orientation dependence of superconductivity at KTO-based interfaces.

Title: The Anyon Zeno Effect
Authors: David F. Mross
Abstract: Two anyons encircling each other acquire a quantized braiding phase that is independent of their spatial separation. We show that detecting this phase in a fractional quantum Hall interference experiment results in a quantum Zeno effect: a localized anyon is trapped by constant observation from a stream of anyons supplied by the measurement current. Interferometers with an embedded antidot are ideal for accessing the Zeno regime, where the bare tunneling rate of localized anyons is much lower than the measurement rate. The Zeno-suppressed tunneling rate of the trapped anyon depends on the braiding phase and the transmission of the quantum point contacts. Our primary prediction is that the autocorrelation time of the conductance through the interferometer increases with the bias current. This effect may be used to experimentally control the anyon dynamics, in particular to increase the lifetime of localized anyons.

Title: Resonant Zener Interferometry in van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: Nisarga Paul, Gil Refael
Abstract: We demonstrate the presence of quantum interference effects in van der Waals heterostructures subject to in-plane electric fields. The in-plane field $F$ accelerates carriers through a hybridized band edge, and interlayer Zener tunneling occurs by distinct pathways, resulting in a solid-state quantum interferometer with imprints in transport observables. For parabolic-band bilayers, we identify two characteristic signatures which are observable in lateral conductance: Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg oscillations in the band-overlap regime periodic in $1/F$ at small fields, resembling electric-field induced quantum oscillations, and a pronounced resonance at $F\propto T_0^{3/2}$ set by the interlayer tunneling $T_0$. These features provide a directly accessible probe of coherent interferometric dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures, and could be harnessed for more precise engineering and characterization.

Title: Probing the influence of topological and geometric disorder on the spectrum of the differential Laplacian operator on networks
Authors: Charles Emmett Maher, Jeremy L. Marzuola, Katherine A. Newhall
Abstract: Metric networks are network-shaped, one-dimensional structures on which one can solve differential equations to simulate a wide range of physical systems including conjugated molecules, photonic crystals, quantum mechanics in waveguide networks, and acoustic metamaterials. More concretely, a metric network is a network whose edges are each assigned a notion of length and a coordinate describing position. One can then define function spaces and differential operators on these objects to model the aforementioned systems. Recent software advancements have made it feasible to analyze partial differential equations on large, compact metric networks with a vast array of structures. Here, we generate compact metric network structures using the spatial tessellations of two-dimensional hyperuniform point patterns, which have suppressed large-scale density fluctuations relative to typical disordered point patterns. This choice of structure is inspired by the exotic physical properties of network materials with these structures in other contexts. Then, we characterize the eigenvalue spectrum structure of the differential Laplace operator on these networks. In particular, we find that gaps can form in the eigenvalue spectra of these networks whose widths increase when the distribution of edge lengths is narrow and as the number of triangular faces increases. Importantly, many of the structures we consider are realizable in Euclidean space, meaning they are well-suited for practical applications in, e.g., metamaterial design. This work can thus be used to inform the design of metric network-based systems with spectral gaps with tunable widths and locations.

Title: Field-induced phase transitions in ferro-antiferromagnetic diblock copolymers
Authors: Alberto Raiola, Emanuele Locatelli, Davide Marenduzzo, Enzo Orlandini
Abstract: We study the equilibrium properties of a model of magnetic diblock copolymer where each monomer is decorated with an Ising-like spin. Spins interact ferromagnetically within each block and antiferromagnetically across blocks, generating frustration between magnetic ordering and spatial organization. By employing a mean-field approach and Monte Carlo simulations for self-avoiding walks on the cubic lattice, we investigate the system's response to an external magnetic field. We discover a rich phase diagram that includes: a swollen phase with both filaments magnetically disordered and spatially extended; a mixed compact phase characterized by a single globule in which the two filaments are strongly intertwined; a segregated compact phase composed of two globular, magnetically ordered, and spatially separated blocks. Further, if the magnitude of the intra-block ferromagnetic interaction differs between the two blocks, we observe a hybrid segregated (``tadpole'') phase where one extended block coexists with a collapsed one. Mean-field predictions are in quantitative agreement with Monte Carlo results for the location of the phase boundaries. These findings provide a minimal statistical-mechanical framework for field-controlled self-assembly of tunable patterns by magnetically heterogeneous polymers. They may also serve as a simple platform to investigate the coupling between internal epigenetic-like states and chromatin folding.

Title: Hidden $Z_{2}\times Z_{2}$ subspace symmetry protection for quantum scars
Authors: Ayush Sharma, Vikram Tripathi
Abstract: We study the paradigmatic spin-1 XY chain under open boundary conditions, which hosts exact quantum many-body scars generated by an emergent Spectrum Generating Algebra (SGA). We show that the scar subspace possesses a symmetry-protected trivial (SPt) character that we attribute to a hidden $Z_{2}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry of another model, namely the commutant Hamiltonian, for which the scars are the ground states. We construct a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) type twist operator, which, for scar states, takes the value $-1,$ and, for ergodic states, approaches zero in the thermodynamic limit. A complementary understanding of the stability of the scars under different perturbations is obtained by analyzing the Loschmidt echo and Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) of the scars. Finite-size scaling analysis of the QFI reveals that the scars are much more sensitive to perturbations as compared to the nearby thermal states. Based on the analysis of QFI and different LSM twist operators, we obtain a classification of different SGA-preserving and SGA-breaking perturbations.

Title: An Information-theoretic Collective Variable for Configurational Entropy
Authors: Ashley Z. Guo, Kaelyn Chang, Nicholas J. Corrente
Abstract: Entropy governs molecular self-assembly, phase transitions, and material stability, yet remains challenging to quantify and directly control in molecular systems. Here, we demonstrate that the computable information density (CID), a data compression-based information theoretic metric, provides an instantaneous general measure of configurational entropy in molecular dynamics simulations, reflecting both local and long-range structural organization. We validate the CID across systems of increasing complexity, beginning with single-component Lennard-Jones melting before examining binary phase separation, polymer condensation and dispersion, and assembly of amorphous carbon networks at multiple densities. Unlike conventional order parameters, CID requires no a priori knowledge of relevant structural features and captures entropic signatures across a variety of molecular systems and discretization resolutions. By establishing entropy as a directly accessible structural metric, this framework lays a foundation for future entropy-driven materials design and optimization strategies.

Title: Controlled symmetry breaking of the Fermi surface in ultracold polar molecules
Authors: Shrestha Biswas, Sebastian Eppelt, Weikun Tian, Wei Zhang, Fulin Deng, Christine Frank, Tao Shi, Immanuel Bloch, Xin-Yu Luo
Abstract: Long-range anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions between ultracold polar molecules are predicted to drive exotic quantum phases, yet direct many-body signatures of these interactions in degenerate Fermi gases have remained elusive. Here, we report the observation of an interaction-induced controlled deformation of the Fermi surface, providing a clear many-body signature in a deeply degenerate Fermi gas of $^{23}\text{Na}^{40}\text{K}$ molecules. Using double microwave (MW) shielding, we prepare $8 \times 10^3$ molecules at $0.23(1)$ times the Fermi temperature, achieving a three-fold suppression of inelastic losses compared to single MW shielding while preserving strong elastic dipolar scattering. We observe Fermi surface deformations of up to $7\,\%$, more than two times larger than those observed in magnetic atoms, despite operating at two orders of magnitude lower densities. Crucially, we demonstrate continuous tuning of the interaction potential from axial U(1) to biaxial C$_{2}$ symmetry, directly imprinting this geometry onto the Fermi surface. We find excellent agreement between our experimental results and parameter-free Hartree-Fock theory. These results establish MW-shielded polar molecules as a highly tunable platform for exploring strongly correlated dipolar Fermi matter and offer a promising path towards topological superfluidity.

Title: Enhancement of superconductivity by disorder in Remeika-type quasiskutterudites
Authors: Andrzej Ślebarski, Maciej M. Maśka
Abstract: Atomic-scale disorder is conventionally regarded as detrimental to superconductivity; however, under specific conditions, it can enhance superconducting properties. Here, we investigate the role of substitutional disorder in Remeika-type quasiskutterudites $R_3M_4$Sn$_{13}$ and $R_5M_6$Sn$_{18}$ ($R=$ Y, La, Lu; $M=$ Co, Rh, Ru) by combining measurements of magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and heat capacity with microscopic modeling. We demonstrate that increasing disorder leads to the emergence of locally superconducting regions characterized by an enhanced critical temperature $T_c^{\ast}$, exceeding the bulk transition temperature $T_c$. Both $T_c^\ast$ and $T_c$ exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on dopant concentration and show a strong correlation with entropy isotherms measured as a function of disorder. The pronounced entropy maxima coincide with the largest separation between $T_c^{\ast}$ and $T_c$, establishing disorder as a thermodynamically controlled parameter governing superconductivity in these materials. Measurements of the upper critical field reveal distinct $H_{c2}(T)$ branches associated with the bulk and locally superconducting phases, providing direct experimental evidence for a percolative superconducting state. To interpret these observations, we propose a microscopic model that captures the interplay between the impurity-induced enhancement of local pairing and the disorder-driven suppression of global superconducting coherence. The model reproduces the experimentally observed nonmonotonic evolution of $T_c^{\ast}$ with disorder and supports a percolation-based interpretation of the superconducting transition. Our results demonstrate that controlled atomic disorder can serve as an effective materials-design parameter for tuning superconductivity in complex correlated systems.

Title: Kondo Reshapes Multiple Orders in a $5f$ van der Waals Material

Abstract: Electron interactions can drive magnetism, superconductivity, and topology. However, the realization of these phases remains limited in van der Waals materials, and the full landscape of strong correlations remains uncharted in any context. While interactions between conduction electrons and localized spins yield a well-known competition between heavy fermions (Kondo hybridization) and magnetic order (RKKY exchange), such spin-driven competition represents only part of the correlated electron phase diagram. Here we demonstrate that a heavy-fermion state can also compete with charge order, such as the charge density wave (CDW) state typical in the van der Waals $4f$ rare-earth tritellurides (RTe$_3$). We exploit the spatially-extended $5f$ orbitals of $\beta$-UTe$_3$ to enhance Kondo hybridization compared to its isostructural RTe$_3$ cousins. Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy on $\beta$-UTe$_3$ shows Fano resonances characteristic of the heavy fermion state, while our quasiparticle interference imaging reveals the disappearance of Fermi-level nesting and the appearance of flat bands. We extend the tritelluride tight-binding model to include Kondo coupling and quantify the Fermi surface reconstruction. Consistent with the destruction of nesting, we observe no CDW in $\beta$-UTe$_3$. Our expansion of the Kondo phase diagram beyond spin-mediated competition opens new possibilities for proximity-induced phase engineering in correlated van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: Mimicking the earth core conditions with ultrafast laser materials interaction
Authors: Mohamed Yaseen Noor, Aram Yedigaryan, Gabriel Calderon, Arshak Tsaturyan, Elena Kanchan, Jinwoo Hwang, Carmen S. Menoni, Jean-Philippe Colombier, Enam Chowdhury
Abstract: Ultrafast lasers create extreme, non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions that can transiently reach pressures and temperatures comparable to interior core of the earth. Here we show that femtosecond excitation of amorphous silica-hafnia multilayer dielectrics drives the formation of high-pressure crystalline phases of silica including stishovite, seifertite, and the pyrite-type high density structure, within confined subsurface this http URL TEM, SAED, and 4D-STEM, we directly map nanoscale phase evolution and identify crystalline motifs embedded inside laser generated this http URL molecular dynamics simualtions reveal the thermodynamic pathway underlying these transformations, where rapid electronic pressure initiates densification and octahedral coordination, followed by temperature driven crystallization and displacive transitions during ultrafast quenching. The resulting polymorphs reflects a dual-stage pathway inaccessible under equilibrium processing. Our results establish femtosecond laser excitation as a viable route to synthesize and stabilize ultrahigh-density high pressure silica phases under ambient conditions, without a diamond anvil cell, with implications for laser-damage mechanisms, high-energy-density materials, and planetary physics.

Title: Many-Body effects beyond excitons in second-harmonic generation of monolayer MoS$_{2}$
Authors: Peio Garcia-Goiricelaya, Julen Ibañez-Azpiroz
Abstract: We present a quantitative study of many-body effects including the three-particle level on second-harmonic generation in monolayer MoS$_{2}$. Our approach combines many-body perturbation theory with time-dependent current-density-functional theory within an \textit{ab initio} framework in the optical limit. Inclusion of two-particle excitonic effects \textit{via} a dynamical long-range linear exchange-correlation kernel reproduces the qualitative features of the second-harmonic response, but underestimates the experimentally reported magnitudes by nearly a factor of two. By incorporating three-particle (trionic) correlations through a static long-range quadratic exchange-correlation kernel, we achieve significantly improved quantitative agreement with experiment. These findings highlight the role of many-body interactions beyond the excitonic level in accurately describing second-order optical responses in two-dimensional semiconductors.

Title: Impact of Stealthy Hyperuniform Magnetic Impurity Configurations on Bulk Magnetism in a Two-dimensional Heisenberg Model
Authors: K. Asakura, K. Yamamoto, A. Koga
Abstract: We investigate an antiferromagnetic quantum Heisenberg model on a square lattice with high-spin magnetic impurities to clarify how random and stealthy hyperuniform impurity configurations influence the bulk magnetic properties. Stealthy hyperuniform configurations are generated using generalized cost functions that interpolate between square-lattice-like and triangular-lattice-like arrangements. Using linear spin-wave theory for the mixed-spin model, we demonstrate that triangular-lattice-like arrangements yield a larger average staggered magnetization than both random and square-lattice-like cases. This enhancement originates from sublattice effects: while the square-lattice-like configuration enforces nearest-neighbor impurities to occupy opposite sublattices due to its bipartite structure, the triangular-lattice-like arrangement allows same-sublattice nearest-neighbor pairs, thereby strengthening cooperative magnetic enhancement.

Title: The Surface Sensitivity of X-ray Second Harmonic Generation as a Function of Energy
Authors: Daniel Schacher, Tod A. Pascal, Keith V. Lawler, Craig P. Schwartz
Abstract: The surface sensitivity and probe depth in the x-ray regime of diamond for second harmonic generation (SHG) was investigated both analytically and computationally with velocity gauge real-time time-dependent density functional theory (VG-RT-TDDFT), which includes a full multipole expansion. This was accomplished using two different approaches, by changing the number and location of layers that can generate SHG computationally and by exploiting the symmetry of a crystal, a similar pattern emerged. We find that by 1000 eV, well above the ~285 eV of the C $K$-edge, the SHG of diamond is dominated by the bulk, quadrupole response, in agreement with our analytic calculations. The bulk response continues to grow as the energy is increased, becoming overwhelming by 7000 eV. Near the C $K$-edge the measurement is quite surface sensitive, however, this surface sensitivity reduces as the energy increases such that by 1000 eV (and certainly by 3500 eV) SHG is largely bulk sensitive. Moreover, we find that the specific details of the crystal orientation (i.e., comparing a (001)-terminated and (111)-terminated surface) appear to have significant effects on the surface sensitivity.

Title: Interpretable self-driving sputter epitaxy: from black-box optimization to human-usable growth rules
Authors: Yuki K. Wakabayashi, Yui Ogawa, Franz Benedict Romero, Takuma Otsuka, Yoshitaka Taniyasu
Abstract: Self-driving laboratories have emerged as powerful tools for navigating high-dimensional process spaces, yet systems remain black-box optimizers that yield limited transferable process understanding. Here, we demonstrate an interpretable self-driving laboratory framework that transforms autonomous optimization into human-usable growth rules. As a stringent benchmark, we apply this framework to RF magnetron sputtering, addressing a long-standing challenge of achieving high-quality beta-Ga2O3 heteroepitaxy and single-crystalline beta-Ga2O3 homoepitaxy via sputtering. By combining Bayesian optimization with automated optical evaluation of the Urbach energy as a metric of sub-bandgap disorder, the self-driving system efficiently identifies heteroepitaxial growth conditions yielding a minimum Urbach energy of 182 meV, the lowest value for sputtered beta-Ga2O3 films. Importantly, the optimized growth window is transferable, realizing single-crystalline beta-Ga2O3 homoepitaxy without further optimization, corroborated by scanning transmission electron microscopy. To convert the closed-loop dataset into interpretable growth rules, we train a random forest surrogate and distill it into response curves and quantified pairwise interactions across the four-dimensional growth-parameter space. This analysis identifies substrate temperature as the primary control knob, with RF power and gas flows acting largely additively and only a modest temperature-oxygen coupling delineating the narrow window for high-quality growth, establishing a general route from autonomous experimentation to transferable growth rules.

Title: Quantum-geometry-driven Mott transitions and magnetism
Authors: Jixun K. Ding, Martin Claassen
Abstract: Quantum geometry quantifies how the single-particle Bloch wavefunction changes in phase and amplitude across the Brillouin Zone. In multi-orbital systems where bands have strongly mixed orbital composition, quantum geometry plays a vital role in determining the ground state and low-energy properties of interacting electronic systems. In this work, we show that Mott metal-insulator transitions, as well as transitions between different magnetic orders within the Mott insulating phase, can be driven by the quantum geometry of the underlying Bloch band, thereby providing a mechanism complementary to conventional bandwidth-tuned Mott transitions. By studying the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate that in in half-filled and topologically-trivial bands, quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states alone can act as a tuning knob for Mott metal-to-insulator and affect the competition between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. We show that both transitions may be heuristically understood via non-local Coulomb scattering in a basis of exponentially localized Wannier functions. These results highlight the role of quantum geometry beyond topological settings as a governing principle for conventional Mott and magnetic physics in multi-orbital and moiré materials.

Title: Symmetry-Protected Minimum of Four Conventional Weyl Points in Nonmagnetic Crystals
Authors: Ze-Xin Xue, Ke-Xin Pang, Yun-Yun Bai, Yanfeng Ge, Yong Liu, Yan Gao
Abstract: Realizing nonmagnetic Weyl semimetals (WSMs) with the minimal number of conventional Weyl points (WPs) and a clean Fermi surface remains a central challenge. Here, combining symmetry analysis with first-principles calculations, we establish the definitive conditions under which a nonmagnetic crystal can host exactly four conventional ($C = \pm 1$) WPs, identifying 76 space groups in the spinless limit and 83 in the spinful case that allow this minimal configuration. Guided by this framework, we predict two previously unknown boron allotropes, P6-B$_{48}$ and TBIN-B$_{48}$, as ideal WSMs. Both exhibits precisely four isolated WPs near the Fermi level, with exceptionally clean electronic structures. Notably, the WPs in P6-B$_{48}$ are pinned to high-symmetry points, while those in TBIN-B$_{48}$ lie along high-symmetry lines, leading to distinct and experimentally accessible surface states, including single and double Fermi arcs. Our work provides a complete symmetry-based foundation and pristine material platforms for minimal Weyl physics.

Title: Symmetry-enforced agreement of Kohn--Sham and many-body Berry phases in the SSH--Hubbard chain
Authors: Kai Watanabe
Abstract: We study when a density-matching Kohn--Sham (KS) description can reproduce a many-body Berry phase in a correlated insulator, despite the fact that geometric phases are functionals of the wave function. Focusing on the one-dimensional SSH--Hubbard chain on a ring as a controlled interacting topological model, we introduce a $U(1)$ twist $\theta$ (flux insertion). The many-body ground state along the full twist cycle is computed by the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), while the onsite interaction $U$ is tuned from the noninteracting to the strong-coupling regime. At half filling in the inversion-symmetric gapped regime, our DMRG calculations show that the density remains constant within numerical accuracy over the entire $(\theta,U)$ range studied. Thus, the density has no dependence on either the flux $\theta$ or the interaction strength $U$. Accordingly, the symmetry-preserving density constraint collapses the KS reference to an SSH-type quadratic representative with $U$-independent geometric diagnostics. Nevertheless, the many-body wave function exhibits a nontrivial geometric response: the quantum metric associated with the $\theta$-parametrized ground-state manifold depends on $\theta$ at intermediate $U$ and is strongly suppressed at large $U$, consistent with the charge fluctuation freezing. Intriguingly, the KS and many-body Berry phases coincide throughout the gapped regime as $U$ is tuned from weak to strong coupling. We show that this agreement is best understood as symmetry-enforced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector matching, rather than as evidence that the density encodes the many-body Berry connection.

Title: Single Pair of Charge-two Weyl Fermions in Chiral Boron Allotropes
Authors: Hui-Jing Zheng, Yan Gao, Yanfeng Ge, Yong Liu, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: The realization of a minimal Weyl semimetal (WSM) hosting a single pair of Weyl points (WPs) has thus far been restricted to magnetic systems, since time-reversal symmetry generally enforces a minimum of four WPs in nonmagnetic materials. Here, combining first-principles calculations with symmetry analysis, we identify two stable boron allotropes, chiral HDSBC-B$_{20}$ and cage-like CR-B$_{12}$, as the first nonmagnetic electronic materials realizing a single pair of WPs in the spinless regime. We show that the interplay between time-reversal symmetry and crystallographic rotation symmetry ($C_4$ or $C_3$) stabilizes exactly one pair of $C=2$ WPs pinned at time-reversal-invariant momenta, thereby circumventing the conventional node-quartet constraint. These double-WPs exhibit linear dispersion along the rotation axis and quadratic dispersion in the perpendicular plane. In HDSBC-B$_{20}$, the sign of the topological charge is directly correlated with structural chirality. Both materials host exceptionally long double Fermi arcs spanning the surface Brillouin zone, providing experimentally accessible signatures. Our findings establish nonmagnetic material platforms for minimal double-Weyl fermions and broaden the landscape of unconventional WSMs.

Title: Memory-Dominated Quantum Criticality as a Universal Route to High-Temperature Superconductivity
Authors: Byung Gyu Chae
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical origin of high--temperature superconductivity remains a central challenge of strongly correlated quantum matter. Conventional approaches to quantum criticality assume overdamped Markovian dissipation governed by Ohmic Landau damping. Here we show that infrared collective dynamics is instead generically controlled by the time--scale density of states (TDOS) of relaxation modes. Within the Martin--Siggia--Rose--Janssen--De Dominicis formalism, we derive an exact spectral representation of the collective susceptibility in terms of the TDOS. A finite infrared TDOS defines a new universality class of memory--dominated critical dynamics characterized by long--time kernels $K(t)\sim1/t$ and nonanalytic dynamical response. This spectral reorganization produces a strong infrared amplification of the particle--particle channel, converting the marginal instabilities of BCS and Eliashberg theories into algebraic superconducting transitions. As a result, the transition temperature scales linearly with the infrared spectral weight of slow collective modes, naturally yielding superconducting domes and Uemura scaling without invoking bosonic glue or fine tuning. The same slow--mode reservoir governs anomalous normal--state dynamics, including long--time correlations and strange--metal behavior, providing a unified description of thermodynamic and dynamical phenomena in correlated superconductors. Our results establish dynamical spectral organization as a fundamental principle of quantum critical matter and identify memory--dominated criticality as a generic route to high--temperature superconductivity.

Title: Moire Engineering of Cooper-Pair Density Modulation States
Authors: Zihao Wang, Bing Xia, Stephen Paolini, Zi-Jie Yan, Pu Xiao, Jiatao Song, Veer Gowda, Hongtao Rong, Di Xiao, Xiaodong Xu, Weida Wu, Ziqiang Wang, Cui-Zu Chang
Abstract: Cooper-pair density modulation (CPDM) states are superconducting phases in which the order parameter varies periodically in real space without breaking translational symmetry. Recently, moire superlattices in layered materials have emerged as powerful platforms for engineering charge density with tunable lattice symmetry, offering a new route to creating and controlling CPDM states. In this work, we demonstrate moire-induced CPDM states in a bilayer heterostructure formed by epitaxially stacking one quintuple layer (1 QL) of topological insulator Sb2Te3 on a six-unit-cell (6 UC) antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) measurements reveal a moiré superlattice formed between the hexagonal Te lattice of Sb2Te3 and the square Te lattice of FeTe, which spatially modulates the two superconducting gaps of the 1 QL Sb2Te3/6 UC FeTe bilayer. Our Josephson STM/S measurements provide direct real-space imaging of the CPDM states with a wavelength corresponding to the periodicity of the moire superlattice. By substituting Sb2Te3 with Bi2Te3, we achieve control over both the periodicity and magnitude of the CPDM states. Our work demonstrates an epitaxial strategy for synthesizing moire superlattices from materials with different crystal symmetries and reveals a new mechanism for engineering CPDM states in designer bilayer heterostructures.

Title: Exact mapping of a spin glass with correlated disorder to the pure Ising model
Authors: Hidetoshi Nishimori
Abstract: We introduce an Ising spin-glass model with correlated disorder which continuously interpolates between the pure ferromagnetic Ising model and the Edwards-Anderson model with symmetric disorder. For this model, we prove that physical quantities on the Nishimori line (NL) can be expressed exactly in terms of those of the pure Ising model at an effective temperature on any lattice in any dimension. For example, the energy on the NL is equal to the energy of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature up to a constant and a trivial factor. More remarkably, the specific heat on the NL equals the energy, not the specific heat, of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature, again up to a constant and a trivial factor. Gauge-noninvariant quantities such as the magnetization and correlation functions are exactly equal to the corresponding quantities of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature. These exact relations imply that the leading critical behavior at that multicritical point for the disorder-correlated model is pure-Ising-like, in contrast to the conventional multicritical universality class of the standard Edwards-Anderson model. Our results motivate further investigations of the relatively unexplored topic of correlations in disorder in spin glasses and related problems.

Title: Chaos in Liquid Crystal Directrons
Authors: Praveen Kumar Singh, Salman Ahmad Khan, Soumik Das
Abstract: Biological systems often operate at the boundary between order and chaos, transitioning from directed to irregular dynamics to achieve adaptability and robustness. Reproducing such transitions in artificial soft matter remains a central challenge. Here, we report a biomimetic regime of directron dynamics in achiral nematic liquid crystals, in which coherent, directed motion collectively evolves into chaos. Driven by multi-directron interactions, the system develops coexisting directron families with competing trajectories, displaying randomized motion, dynamic assembly formation and spontaneous fission of high energy to low energy daughter directrons - all of which mimics the phenotypic diversity observed in biological groups. Above a critical electric field, these interactions drive the system into a chaotic state that is distinct from the directed behaviours reported previously. We further introduce a minimal dipole-based model that qualitatively captures the underlying physics of this transition. Together, our results establish an artificial active system in which chaos emerges intrinsically from interactions, offering a versatile platform to study biological dynamics and opening new avenues for liquid-crystal-based soft-matter applications involving adaptive transport, cargo delivery, and energy transduction

Title: Quantum Monte Carlo study of the metal-insulator crossover in the square-lattice Hubbard model
Authors: Mingzhong Lu, Yu-Feng Song, Youjin Deng, Yuan-Yao He
Abstract: The interaction-driven evolution from a Fermi liquid to a Mott insulator is a hallmark of strongly correlated fermion systems. In this work, we present a {\it numerically unbiased} study of such metal-to-insulator crossover in the half-filled square-lattice Hubbard model at finite temperatures, employing auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. By jointly analyzing thermodynamic and dynamical observables, we establish the crossover diagram of the model in the temperature-interaction ($T$-$U$) plane. With increasing $U$, our numerical results reveal an extended crossover regime, which we refer to as the {\it Bad Metal}, that separates the Fermi liquid and Mott insulator. During the crossover, we also examine the antiferromagnetic spin correlations and observe pronounced nodal-antinodal dichotomy in the momentum-resolved single-particle spectral functions. Furthermore, we investigate the temperature dependence of several commonly used observables in the model. As representative results, we achieve an accurate map of the thermal entropy across the crossover diagram, and identify the parameter regions in which the model exhibits the Pomeranchuk cooling, characterized by an adiabatic cooling with increasing $U$. Beyond offering a more refined understanding of the crossover phenomenon, our work also provides valuable benchmark and guideline for future optical lattice experiments on the square-lattice Hubbard model.

Title: LLM-driven discovery for carbon allotropes with bond-network entropy
Authors: Yuzhou Hao, Yujie Liu, Xuejie Li, Turab Lookman, Xiangdong Ding, Jun Sun, Zhibin Gao
Abstract: The discovery of novel carbon allotropes with tailored thermal and mechanical properties is critical for advanced thermal management. However, exploring the vast configurational space of carbon using \textit{ab initio} calculations remains computationally prohibitive. Driven by the rich topological landscape of carbon, where the competition between $sp, sp^2,$ and $sp^3$ hybridization states dictates material performance, we establish a closed-loop AI framework to explore this complex configurational space. We introduce a hybridization entropy descriptor to guide the search beyond conventional forms. Here, we establish a closed-loop AI framework that synergizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for structural generation with a Machine Learning Potential (MLP) for accelerated evaluation. Leveraging CrystaLLM to generate candidates and an iteratively refined MLP for high-fidelity validation, we screened thousands of structures to identify several stable allotropes with exotic properties. Specifically, we report ``yne-diamond C$_{12}$'' and ``yne-hex-diamond C$_{8}$'', which exhibit extreme thermal anisotropy and ultralow in-plane shear stiffness arising from their mixed $sp$-$sp^3$ hybridization. Furthermore, we discovered a complex $sp$-$sp^2$-$sp^3$ hybridized C$_{12}$ phase that combines metallic conductivity with an anomalous negative Poisson's ratio. Notably, we identified a superhard phase (C16_3) possessing a calculated Vickers hardness (103.3 GPa) exceeding that of diamond 96 GPa). Microscopic analysis reveals that thermal transport in these materials is governed by the interplay between rigid frameworks and flexible linkers. This work expands the known carbon phase space and demonstrates the efficacy of coupling generative AI with machine learning potentials for the accelerated inverse design of functional materials.

Title: Phonons reflect dynamic spin-state order in LaCoO$_3$
Authors: Alsu Ivashko, Taishun Manjo, Maximilian Kauth, Yuliia Tymoshenko, Adrian M. Merritt, Klaus-Peter Bohnen, Rolf Heid, Michael Merz, Andreas Eich, John-Paul Castellan, Alexandre Ivanov, Nathaniel Schreiber, Hong Zheng, J. F. Mitchell, Martin Meven, Jitae T. Park, Daisuke Ishikawa, Yuiga Nakamura, Alfred Q. Baron, Frank Weber
Abstract: We investigate lattice dynamics in LaCoO$_3$ using inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering over $T = 2\mbox{-}650\,\mathrm{K}$, spanning the spin-state crossover at $T_{1} \approx 100\,\mathrm{K}$ and the insulator--metal transition at $T_{2} \approx 550\,\mathrm{K}$. Comparison with quasi-harmonic $ab-initio$ lattice-dynamical calculations helps reveal anomalous softening of a $\approx 10\,\mathrm{meV}$ oxygen phonon, confined to the temperature interval $T_{1} \leq T \leq T_{2}$ and localized in momentum space at $\boldsymbol{q}_{\mathrm{SSO}} = \left( \frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2} \right)_{c}$. This wave vector corresponds to the spin-state ordering originally proposed by Goodenough [J. Phys. Chem. Solids 6, 287-297 (1958)]. Our results therefore provide momentum-resolved evidence for dynamic correlations of high-spin and low-spin Co$^{3+}$ states in LaCoO$_{3}$, linking spin-state fluctuations to anomalous phonon renormalization.

Title: Role of the Nephelauxetic Effect in Engineering Mn4+ Luminescence Kinetics for Lifetime-Based Thermometry
Authors: A. Basheer, M. Szymczak, M. Piasecki, A. M. Srivastava, M.G. Brik, L. Marciniak
Abstract: Although the considerable potential of luminescence thermometry based on emission kinetics has been widely demonstrated, reliable tools for the intentional prediction of thermometric performance remain limited. To address this challenge, the present work introduces an approach that enables a theoretical description of the 2E state lifetime of Mn4+ ions, as well as the absolute and relative sensitivities, in terms of the nephelauxetic effect within the group of double perovskites: Sr2InNbO6, Sr2InTaO6, Ba2InTaO6, and Ba2InNbO6. Our results clearly show that, contrary to common assumptions, the Dq/B ratio is not the primary factor governing either the spectroscopic behavior of Mn4+ ions or the thermometric performance of Mn4+-doped phosphors. Instead, the nephelauxetic beta1 parameter plays the dominant role. The empirical analysis carried out in this study led to the development of a predictive model that enables estimation of SAMAX and SRMAX values based exclusively on beta1. This methodology represents a significant step toward the rational design of lifetime-based luminescence thermometers with predefined thermometric characteristics tailored to the requirements of specific applications.

Title: Emergence of chiral $p$-wave and $d$-wave states in $g$-wave altermagnets
Authors: Tilen Cadez, Abraham Nathan Sunanta, Kyoung-Min Kim
Abstract: Altermagnets emerge as a novel platform for realizing unconventional superconductivity through their exotic momentum-dependent spin-splitting of electronic band structures. Recent experiments have uncovered a novel form of altermagnetism with distinctive $g$-wave symmetry in CrSb. However, the potential for unconventional superconductivity arising from $g$-wave altermagnetism in such systems remains largely unexplored. In this study, we discover the emergence of chiral superconducting states in three-dimensional $g$-wave altermagnetic metals. Through systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with $g$-wave altermagnetic exchange fields in a three-dimensional hexagonal lattice, as observed in CrSb, we find that the altermagnetic spin splitting of Fermi surfaces favors chiral $p$-wave states as the dominant pairing channel under strong altermagnetic fields and high electron densities, while chiral $d$-wave states become predominant under weak altermagnetic fields and intermediate electron densities. Conversely, at weak altermagnetic fields and typical electron densities, non-chiral $s$-, extended $s$-, or $f$-wave states become stabilized. We also showcase the possible experimental detection using the quasiparticle energy dispersions and the density of states to distinguish different pairing symmetries. These findings underscore the potential of $g$-wave altermagnets to host sought-after chiral and gapless superconductivity.

Title: Anti-Thermal Quenching Phosphors based on Metal Halides
Authors: Baowei Zhang, Liberato Manna
Abstract: Thermal quenching (TQ) generally occurs in phosphors and is ascribed to the activation of non-radiative transitions at elevated temperatures. This effect limits the use of most phosphors in high-power/high-temperature applications, such as outdoor lighting and laser systems. To achieve anti-TQ properties, structural design of phosphors is required. This usually follows two guidelines: (1) increasing lattice rigidity to minimize thermal expansion; (2) converting thermal energy into radiative transitions to compensate for the non-radiative losses. While metal oxides and metal nitrides dominate the field of commercial anti-TQ phosphors, metal halides - despite their inherently soft lattices - have shown remarkable progress as anti-TQ phosphors in recent years. Here, we review the advances in anti-TQ metal halides (covering the time span from 2017, when first reports have appeared, till today) and discuss their mechanisms and applications. We argue that the low synthesis temperatures of metal halides and their high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) make them promising candidates as anti-TQ phosphors. Furthermore, since the rich optical-physical processes underlying the anti-TQ effect in soft-lattice in metal halides are only now beginning to be unraveled, this creates opportunities for many fundamental investigations.

Title: Interaction and disorder effects on Cooper instability in two-dimensional fractional Dirac semimetals
Authors: Hua Zang, Jing Wang
Abstract: Employing a renormalization group analysis that allows for an unbiased treatment of competing physical ingredients, we systematically trace how the interplay between Cooper pairing and disorder scatterings governs the emergence or suppression of Cooper instability in the low-energy regime of fractional Dirac this http URL the clean limit, we find that the emergence of Cooper instability requires surpassing a finite interaction threshold $|\lambda_c|$, and depends sensitively on both the fractional exponent $\alpha$ and the transfer momentum $\mathbf{Q}=(Q,\phi)$. Specifically, bigger values of $\alpha$ enhance the tendency toward BCS instability. For $\alpha\in(0.001,0.61)$, the $(Q,\phi)$ parameter space separates into two distinct regions: Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}, where Cooper instability is suppressed, and Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}, where it is allowed. In the presence of disorders, we demonstrate that they can either promote or suppress Cooper instability. Disorder of type $\Delta_1$ or $\Delta_2$ enhances superconductivity by reducing the critical interaction threshold $|\lambda_c|$ and expanding the superconducting phase space (Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}). In sharp contrast, either $\Delta_0$ or $\Delta_3$ suppresses Cooper pairing by increasing $|\lambda_c|$ and shrinking the available phase space (Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}). Although Cooper instability can be enhanced when promotive disorders ($\Delta_1$, $\Delta_2$) coexist with a single suppressive disorder ($\Delta_0$ or $\Delta_3$), the suppressive influence of $\Delta_{0,3}$ generally dominates the promotive effects of $\Delta_{1,2}$ in the presence of all sorts of disorders. These results would be helpful for further studies of fractional Dirac semimetals and alike materials.

Title: Magnetoresistance Oscillations in Few-Layer NbSe2 in Superconducting Fluctuation Regime
Authors: Xiaolong Yin, Congzhe Cao, Yibin Feng, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jiawei Mei, Qi-Kun Xue, Shuo-Ying Yang
Abstract: Quantum interference phenomena in superconductors, such as Josephson interference and Little-Parks oscillations, serve as powerful probes of phase coherence, symmetry breaking and vortex dynamics. However, they are typically observed in well-defined mesoscopic structures, and their behavior in the two-dimensional limit remains largely unexplored. Here, we report periodic magnetoresistance oscillations, superconducting interference patterns, and interfering diode effect in unpatterned few-layer NbSe2. These phenomena emerge exclusively within the superconducting fluctuation regime of thin samples, consistent with the enhanced anomalous metallic behavior of atomically thin NbSe2. The non-monotonic temperature dependence of both the oscillation amplitude and the diode efficiency can be captured by a model in which thermally activated vortices traverse intrinsic supercurrent loops. Our results reveal that the observed interference phenomena originate from the lost of global phase coherence, providing a new route to accessing interference effects in unpatterned superconductors.

Title: First-principles and tight-binding analysis of thermoelectricity in irradiated WSe$_2$
Authors: Cynthia Ihuoma Osuala, Tanu Choudhary, Raju K. Biswas, Sudin Ganguly, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: Electronic and thermoelectric transport in zigzag monolayer WSe$_2$ nanoribbons are studied under monochromatic irradiation. The electronic structure is described within a six-orbital tight-binding framework constructed from the relevant tungsten and selenium orbitals, with atomic spin-orbit coupling included explicitly. Periodic driving is incorporated via the Peierls substitution, and in the high-frequency limit the system is mapped onto an effective static Floquet Hamiltonian with polarization-dependent renormalized hoppings. Coherent transport is evaluated using wave-function matching within the Landauer-Büttiker formalism. The lattice thermal conductivity is obtained independently from density functional perturbation theory combined with an iterative solution of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Light-induced hopping renormalization reshapes the band dispersion and transmission spectrum near the Fermi level, modifying the Landauer transport integrals that determine electrical and thermal conductances and the Seebeck coefficient. Together with spin-orbit-driven band splitting and reduced lattice thermal conductivity from enhanced anharmonic scattering, this leads to a thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$ exceeding unity over a broad temperature range.

Title: Hourglass Dirac chains enable intrinsic topological superconductivity in nonsymmorphic silicides
Authors: Shashank Srivastava, Dibyendu Samanta, Pavan Kumar Meena, Poulami Manna, Priya Mishra, Suhani Sharma, Prabin Kumar Naik, Rhea Stewart, Adrian D. Hillier, Sudeep Kumar Ghosh, Ravi Prakash Singh
Abstract: Nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetries provide a robust route to symmetry-protected electronic topology, yet their role in stabilizing intrinsic topological superconductivity remains largely unexplored. Here, we report \ch{TaPtSi} as a new member of the superconducting nonsymmorphic silicide family, characterized via AC transport, magnetization, heat capacity, and muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements. Zero field $\mu$SR reveals spontaneous internal magnetic fields below $T_{\rm c}$, establishing time reversal symmetry breaking in \ch{TaPtSi}. First principles calculations on \ch{TaPtSi} and its isostructural nonsymmorphic superconducting analogues reveal the presence of symmetry-protected hourglass dispersions. The "necks" of these dispersions form Dirac nodal rings and chains that reside near or intersect the Fermi level. Guided by Ginzburg Landau symmetry analysis, we identify an internally antisymmetric non unitary triplet pairing state as the unique ground state consistent with the experimental phenomenology. Based on Bogoliubov de Gennes calculations, we further demonstrate that this state supports Majorana surface modes, establishing its intrinsically topological nature. These results reveal a systematic route by which nonsymmorphic symmetry drives the interplay between hourglass Dirac chain topology and unconventional triplet pairing, positioning equiatomic silicides as a unified materials platform for intrinsic topological superconductivity.

Title: Self-foaming, Sintering-resistant Iron-Tungsten Powders Enable High-Cycle Thermochemical Hydrogen Storage
Authors: Jie Qi, David C. Dunand
Abstract: H2-H2O redox cycling of iron powder beds at 650-800 °C offers a compact, safe, economical hydrogen storage method, but sintering-induced capacity loss has stalled its scalability for decades. Here, we show that adding redox-active tungsten to Fe powders solves this problem in static powder beds: Fe-25W (at%) alloyed powder self-foams during redox cycling via W gas-phase transport, increasing porosity and preserving capacity. In a custom automated reactor, a kilogram-scale powder bed reversibly stores 42g H2 and sustains 96+/-3% capacity utilization over 30 redox cycles. Temperature-resolved in-situ X-ray diffraction reveals a chemical-vapor-transport-mediated self-foaming mechanism that redistributes W to refine the microstructure, complemented by a contact-barrier stabilization mechanism during high-temperature holds. Partial-capacity cycling up to 90 cycles further confirms sintering resistance under incomplete redox conditions. These results establish Fe-W powder beds as a robust, scalable, and compact platform for safe, stationary hydrogen storage.

Title: Surface-localized topological superconductivity in nodal-loop materials: BdG analysis
Authors: Takeru Matsushima, Hiroki Tsuchiura
Abstract: We theoretically study surface superconductivity in a nodal-line semimetal by combining a minimal tight-binding model with a layer-resolved Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach. In the normal state, the model realizes a bulk nodal loop and an associated drumhead surface band in a slab geometry with open boundaries in the $z$ direction: the central layers reproduce the bulk-like density of states, whereas the surface layer exhibits a sharp zero-energy peak originating from the drumhead states. On top of this band structure we introduce chiral $p$-wave and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconducting channels and determine the layer-dependent gap amplitudes self-consistently. The chiral $p$-wave order parameter is strongly enhanced at the outermost layers and decays within only a few layers towards the interior, while the $d$-wave order parameter is more than an order of magnitude smaller on all layers. The quasiparticle dispersion and surface local density of states in the chiral $p$-wave state show that the drumhead band is efficiently gapped out and that the zero-energy peak in the normal surface spectrum is split into two coherence peaks, directly reflecting the induced superconducting gap. These results demonstrate that superconductivity driven by drumhead surface states is naturally biased toward a surface-localized chiral $p$-wave pairing symmetry and may offer qualitative guidance for interpreting surface-sensitive experiments on Pd-doped CaAgP.

Title: Non-linear visco-elasto-plastic rheology of a viscous vertex model
Authors: Shalabh Kumar Anand, Matthias Merkel
Abstract: Morphogenesis involves complex shape changes of biological tissues. Yet, tissue shape changes depend on tissue rheology, which in turn arises from the interplay of large numbers of cells. Here, we link cell- and tissue-scale mechanics by constructing mean-field rheological relations for the vertex model. In contrast to past work in the field, we study a vertex model with an explicit viscous friction. We also include two different cellular mechanisms creating active, anisotropic stresses. Our mean-field model accounts for cell shape and the non-linear elastic and visco-plastic regimes. We validate our results by predicting the response to large-amplitude oscillatory shear. There are several vertex model variants, and comparing to results from the literature, we show that their rheology depends on a number of model details. Our approach should be sufficiently general to construct non-linear mean-field constitutive relations for any cell-based tissue model.

Title: Macroscopic quantum self-trapping in bosonic Josephson junctions: an exact quantum treatment
Authors: Andrea Bardin, Anna Minguzzi, Luca Salasnich
Abstract: We investigate the fully quantum evolution of the population imbalance in a perfectly symmetric Bose-Josephson junction modeled by a two-mode Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, focusing on the validity of macroscopic quantum self-trapping beyond the mean-field theory. We show that for any finite number of particles the exact quantum dynamics leads to the breakdown of macroscopic quantum self-trapping after a finite time, regardless of the initial state. Using the symmetries of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, we provide a mathematical demonstration of this result and analyze the spectral properties governing the dynamics. We identify a branching behavior in the eigenvalues differences and a nontrivial structure of the population-imbalance amplitudes. These features allow us to distinguish two clearly different dynamical regimes and to elucidate the mechanism leading to the emergence of a quasi-MQST regime for large particle numbers. These findings bridge the gap between mean-field predictions and exact quantum dynamics and provide insight into the emergence of classical nonlinear behavior from finite quantum many-body systems.

Title: Substrate induced optimization of the Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) performances of MoS2 thin film

Abstract: Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has emerged as a promising, cost-effective catalyst for hydrogen production via water splitting. We investigate the structural and electrocatalytic properties of MoS2 thin films deposited on different substrates (Al2O3, SiC, STO) to study their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. In particular, in order to study the substrate influence on the stabilization of different polymorphic MoS2 phases, the films are synthesised using pulsed laser deposition on substrates with different crystal symmetries and lattice parameters. All the deposited samples are characterized by X-Ray Diffraction, Raman Spectroscopy, Linear Sweep Voltammetry and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy analyses. The films grown on Al2O3 substrates exhibit the best HER performance, likely due to the stabilization of the metastable 1T phase through the interfacial interactions between film and substrate. Presence of the 1T phase in the samples grown on Al2O3 improves the charge transfer efficiency and the electrochemically active surface with a better response to the applied potential, demonstrating their enhanced catalytic behaviour for hydrogen evolution.

Title: Dephasing-induced relaxation in tight-binding chains with linear and nonlinear defects
Authors: Debraj Das, Andrea Gambassi, Stefano Iubini, Stefano Lepri
Abstract: We investigate thermalization in a tight-binding chain with an on-site defect subject to local dephasing noise implemented as random phase kicks. For a single linear defect of strength $\epsilon$, we obtain an exact analytical description of the system spectrum and formulate the dephasing-induced dynamics in the eigenstate basis. We derive an approximate kinetic equation for mode populations that describes a continuous-time random walk in action space. The walk transition rates are defined by the overlap matrix encoding the spatial structure of eigenstates that can be computed exactly. Analyzing the spectral properties of the equation, we show that defect-induced localized modes act as bottlenecks that strongly slow down relaxation, with rates scaling as $\epsilon^{-2}$ for strong defects. Using large-deviation theory, we characterize rare dynamical trajectories and identify distinct relaxation pathways associated with low- and high-activity regimes in action space. We provide numerical evidence that the large-deviation function exhibits a dynamical phase transition in the limit $\epsilon \to \infty$. We then extend our analysis to the nonlinear case, considering a single nonlinear defect embedded in either a linear or a fully nonlinear discrete Schrödinger equation. Numerical simulations reveal a qualitatively faster approach to equilibrium driven by the amplitude-dependent weakening of the defect. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding thermalization, rare fluctuations, and relaxation pathways in stochastic tight-binding systems.

Title: Metastable confinement in Rydberg lattice gauge theories
Authors: Yaohua Li, Devendra Singh Bhakuni, Yong-Chun Liu, Marcello Dalmonte
Abstract: Confinement and string breaking are two fundamental phenomena in gauge theories. Signatures of both are currently pursued in quantum-simulator experiments, opening a new angle on strongly interacting dynamics of gauge fields out of equilibrium, complementary to traditional particle-physics settings. In this work, we report the emergence of metastable confinement dynamics in a U(1) lattice gauge theory, originating from the competition between string tension and four-Fermi coupling - a competition that naturally arises in Rydberg atom arrays. We show that the initial string state can be resonantly melted through controlled energy matching, a phenomenon we identify as resonant string breaking. We demonstrate this mechanism for both static and Floquet-driven systems, where periodic modulation generates a spectrum of tunable sideband resonances. Our work provides new insights into the mechanisms of confinement and string breaking driven by long-range interactions and time-dependent fields, which are available in current quantum simulators on a variety of platforms.

Title: Exact Rheology of Uniform Shear Flow in a Gas of Inelastic and Rough Maxwell Particles
Authors: Andrés Santos, Gilberto M. Kremer
Abstract: We investigate the steady uniform shear flow of a granular gas composed of inelastic and rough Maxwell particles. Exploiting the mean-field character of the model, we derive exact expressions for the collisional production rates of the second-degree moments and obtain a closed nonlinear solution for the stress and spin-spin tensors. The rotational-to-translational temperature ratio and the proportionality between the spin-spin and stress tensors are shown to be independent of the coefficient of normal restitution and determined solely by roughness and moment of inertia. The reduced normal stresses, shear stress, and shear rate are obtained explicitly in terms of two effective parameters generalizing the cooling and stress relaxation rates of the smooth model. From these results we derive exact expressions for the non-Newtonian shear viscosity, the first viscometric function, and the friction coefficient. The dependence of the rheological properties on the normal and tangential restitution coefficients is analyzed in detail, revealing strong non-Newtonian behavior and nonmonotonic effects of roughness. The results reduce, in the appropriate limits, to those of the inelastic Maxwell model for smooth particles and to the Pidduck gas in the elastic perfectly rough case.

Title: A Comparative Study of Structural Representations for 2D Materials: Insights from Dynamic Collision Fingerprint and Matminer
Authors: Raphael M. Tromer, Isaac M. Felix, Rafael Besse, Marcelo L. Pereira Junior, Marcos G. E. da Luz
Abstract: In materials science, the selection of structural descriptors for machine learning protocols strongly influences predictive performance and the degree of physical interpretability that can be achieved from the derived models. Although more complex descriptors may improve numerical accuracy, they often represent extra computational load, also reducing transparency into the underlying structural information. A framework called the Dynamic Collision Fingerprint (DCF) was recently proposed with the goal of producing concise, physically significant representations, generating descriptors via dynamical probing of atomic structures. In this work, we benchmark DCF using a dataset composed of 120 two-dimensional carbon allotropes and compare its performance with the widely considered Matminer library. The analysis employs three regression models, linear regression, decision tree, and XGBoost, evaluated over train and test partitions ranging from 10\% to 90\% and repeated over multiple random seeds in order to characterize statistical variability. The obtained results demonstrate that DCF easily matches Matminer in terms of predicting accuracy across all learning algorithms. However, it accomplishes this using descriptors that are significantly lower dimensional, pointing to manageable computing costs. Moreover, compared to the rather technical Matminer descriptions, the DCF exhibits considerably clearer physical interpretability. These findings suggest that DCF is a significant substitute for high-dimensional descriptor libraries as structural representation since it is both computationally flexible and physically grounded.

Title: Growth-controlled photochromism in yttrium oxyhydride thin films deposited by HiPIMS and pulsed-DC magnetron sputtering
Authors: M. Zubkins, E. Letko, E. Strods, V. Vibornijs, D. Moldarev, K. Sarakinos, K. Mizohata, K. Kundzins, J. Purans
Abstract: The present study investigates photochromic oxygen-containing yttrium hydride (YHO) thin films deposited by reactive high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) and compares their photochromic, optical, and structural properties with those of films synthesized by reactive pulsed direct current magnetron sputtering (pulsed-DCMS). Optical emission spectroscopy reveals that, unlike pulsed-DCMS where Ar$^{+}$ ions dominate, HiPIMS discharges are characterised by strong Y$^{+}$ emission, evidencing high yttrium ionisation and substantial self-sputter recycling. The critical working pressure (P$_c$) required to obtain transparent and photochromic films is higher for HiPIMS (Pc $\approx$ 1.0 Pa) than for pulsed-DCMS (Pc $\approx$ 0.5 Pa). Although films deposited near Pc exhibit similar solar transmittance (~72 %) and lattice parameters (5.38--5.39 Å), the pulsed-DCMS film shows a substantially higher relative photochromic contrast (34 %) and a lower optical band gap (2.70 eV) compared with the HiPIMS film (9 % contrast and 2.94 eV). This difference is partly attributed to a lower oxygen-to-hydrogen atomic ratio in the pulsed-DCMS film. Structurally, HiPIMS films are largely polycrystalline with random out-of-plane crystallographic orientation, whereas pulsed-DCMS films exhibit a pronounced <100> out-of-plane preferred orientation. These results demonstrate that, beyond composition, thin-film growth conditions and microstructure play a crucial role in governing the photochromic performance of YHO.

Title: Coupling between Phase Separation and Geometry on a Closed Elastic Curve: Free Energy Minimization and Dynamics
Authors: Hanchun Wang, Ronojoy Adhikari, Michael E. Cates
Abstract: We study the free energy and dynamics of a closed elastic filament (a one-dimensional curve in two dimensions) whose local internal state is specified by curvature, stretch, and a scalar density field representing, for example, the concentration of an absorbed species. The density variable has a tendency to phase-separate whereas the local spontaneous curvature is concentration-dependent. There is also a coupling between concentration and the stretching of the filament, although our main interest is in the nearly inextensible regime. We formulate and simulate the dynamics, comprising a coupled Willmore flow and Cahn-Hilliard gradient flow on the full differential geometry of a closed filament, addressing issues that previous work typically sidestepped by restricting to the Monge gauge. We use a numerical strategy for global free energy minimization, presenting the equilibrium shapes and density profiles across a wide range of model parameters. The phase diagram is dominated by a relatively small number of simple shapes that exhibit, as expected, strong coupling between local curvature and concentration. We also find regimes where curvature and/or stretching energies suppress phase separation altogether. For selected parameter values we present fully dynamical results, tracking the time evolution of the various contributions to the free energy. The dynamics often arrive at metastable minima rather than the equilibrium state - for example, at states with more than the minimum number of interfaces between coexisting phases. The metastability of these states is absent for phase separation on a rigid circular domain and thus a direct result of the coupling between geometry and density.

Title: Chalcogen Impurity Barriers in 2D Systems via Semi-Empirical/Machine Learning Modeling: A Survey over 4000 Materials
Authors: M. L. Pereira Junior, M. G. E. da Luz, P. Cesana, A. L. da Rosa, M. J. Piotrowski, D. Guedes-Sobrinho, T. A. S. Pereira, E. A. Moujaes, A. C. Dias, R. M. Tromer
Abstract: Adequate characterization of two-dimensional materials with low energy barriers for impurity adsorption is key for advancing applications based on catalysis, sensing, and surface functionalization. However, first-principles methods, such as DFT, are often computationally extremely expensive for feasible large-scale screenings. Given such a scenario, we address a data-driven approach which integrates the semi-empirical Extended Huckel Method with machine learning techniques to estimate adsorption energy barriers in the case of three relevant chalcogen impurities, S, Se and Te. With this aim, we consider the 4036 2D materials found in the C2DB. The scheme employs the EHM to compute energy profiles along three in-plane migration paths, from which average barriers can be derived. The equilibrium distance between the impurity and the 2D surface is not calculated from a tie-consuming geometry optimization. Instead, it is estimated from a simple effective phenomenological expression. Physicochemical descriptors are then obtained from the Matminer library for curated features. Four different ML models are tested, with the XGBoost leading to the highest performance. We further use SHAP to verify the resulting predictions, focusing on the $\sim1,500$ materials displaying the lowest barrier values. As it could be anticipated, we establish that the average valence electron count, electronegativity, and atomic number are typically the most relevant attributes to validate the ML model. But we also are able to determine, for the different chalcogen atoms, which other few descriptors likewise considerably influence the adsorption properties. Our results show that when combined with interpretable ML protocols, EHM can produce a scalable framework for choosing 2D structures that exhibit the desired capture/release dynamics pertinent in a variety of utilization.

Title: Mechanistic Insights into Li+ Transport Enabled by Isolated Sulfur Species in Li3PS4 Glasses
Authors: J. Pawelko, X. Rocquefelte, A. Tetenoire, D. Le Coq, L. Calvez, E. Furet
Abstract: All-solid-state lithium-ion batteries have renewed interest in high-performance solid electrolytes. Li3PS4 (Li2S-P2S5) glasses are among the most studied due to their high ionic conductivity, traditionally ascribed to rotational motion of polyhedral units facilitating Li+ migration. Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we investigate Li-ion diffusion in Li3PS4 glass, demonstrating that our structural model reproduces experimental neutron and X-ray diffraction patterns and conductivity measurements. Importantly, we identify a previously unrecognized diffusion mechanism: Li+ ions near isolated sulfur species (Sn with n = 1, 3) display significantly enhanced mobility, with atomic displacements up to 1.7 greater than those associated with bulkier polyhedral units. These results highlight the critical role of free sulfur species in promoting fast ionic transport, providing insights for the rational design of glass compositions with optimized conductivity for solid-state battery applications

Title: Influence of Hydrogen on Dislocation Relaxation in BCC Iron: Atomistic Mechanisms and Implications
Authors: Sanjay Manda, Madhur Gupta, Saurabh Kumar, Junaid Akhter, P. J. Guruprasad, Indradev Samajdar, Ajay S. Panwar
Abstract: In this study, the influence of pure dislocation and hydrogen-dislocation interactions on anelastic response or internal friction relaxation peaks in bcc-iron was investigated. These relaxations are primarily governed by thermally activated kink nucleation and kink migration events. An atomistic multiscale framework, coupling molecular dynamics (MD) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, was developed to investigate the underlying atomistic mechanisms behind dislocation-relaxation peaks. MD simulations revealed that the presence of hydrogen atoms near the dislocation core facilitates the kink nucleation process by reducing the nucleation barrier while enhancing the barrier for dislocation migration. The KMC model captured Snoek-Koster peaks arising from the Cottrell atmosphere formed by hydrogen atoms and clusters around the dislocation core, providing insights into the atomistic mechanisms controlling these relaxations. Furthermore, the proposed computational scheme elucidated a unique linear relationship between hydrogen content and the internal friction loss factor, offering a methodology for hydrogen detection and quantification.

Title: Pressure-induced reentrant superconductivity in a misfit layered compound $\mathrm{(SnS)_{1.15}(TaS_2)}$
Authors: Chutong Zhang, Jiajia Feng, Xiao Tang, Xiangzhuo Xing, Na Zuo, Xiaolei Yi, Yan Meng, Xiaoran Zhang, Rajesh Kumar Ulaganathan, Raman Sankar, Xiaofeng Xu, Xin Chen, Xiaobing Liu
Abstract: Misfit layered compounds are natural van der Waals heterostructures in which electronically active transition-metal dichalcogenide layers are decoupled by incommensurate blocking layers, enabling bulk realization of quasi-two-dimensional quantum states. Here we investigate the superconducting, transport,and structural properties of the misfit compound $\mathrm{(SnS)_{1.15}(TaS_2)}$ under pressures up to 150 GPa. The low-pressure superconducting phase is gradually suppressed and disappears near 14.7 GPa,accompanied by increasing residual resistance. Remarkably, a distinct superconducting phase reemerges above 80 GPa and persists to the highest pressures achieved. This reentrant superconductivity follows a pressure-induced sign reversal of the Hall coefficient near 60 GPa and a nonmonotonic evolution of the normal-state resistance, indicating an electronic reconstruction. No structural phase transition is detected over the entire pressure range. Our results demonstrate a pressure-driven electronic reconstruction leading to reentrant superconductivity in a misfit layered compound, establishing pressure as an effective route to engineer superconductivity and electronic states in natural van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: Quantum magnetic phase transitions in a Kugel-Khomskii model including spin-orbit coupling
Authors: D. E. Chizhov, P. A. Igoshev, V. Yu. Irkhin
Abstract: Using the formalism of pseudospin and isospin operators the Hamiltonian of an effective Kugel-Khomskii model with spin-orbit coupling is derived with an exact account of the $t_{2g}$ multiplet splitting by the crystal field. An analytical solution is obtained for an arbitrary relation between the Hubbard repulsion and crystal field splitting, i.e., interpolating the cases of Mott-Hubbard and charge-transfer insulators. A description of orbital orders is given in terms of octupole moments. The ground-state phase diagram is constructed in the parameter space spanned by spin-orbit coupling, Hund's exchange, and Hubbard interaction. We investigate a quantum phase transition between a state exhibiting hidden magnetic and orbital long-range order and a ferromagnetic state with a reduced magnetic moment accompanied by antiferroorbital order. It is shown that the cooperative effect of Hund's and spin-orbit interactions gives rise to an easy-plane-type anisotropy.

Title: Highly Efficient Second/Third Harmonic Generation in van der Waals Layered Material AgScP2S6 with Anisotropic Polarization and Temperature Dependence
Authors: Mohamed Yaseen Noor, Ryan Siebenaller, Wenhao Liu, Zixin Zhai, Conrad Kuz, Simin Zhang, Mousumi Upadhyay Kahaly, Gergely Nagy, Aamir Mushtaq, Rahul Rao, Emmanuel Rowe, Benjamin S. Conner, Bing Lv, Michael A. Susner, Enam Chowdhury
Abstract: Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and nonlinear optical measurements, especially second- and third-harmonic generation (SHG/THG) are comprehensively investigated for the van der Waals layered material AgScP2S6 with a non-centrosymmetric P31c (159) space group. Linear optical constants are extracted using spectroscopic ellipsometry and applied in fitting the harmonic generation behavior. Polarization-resolved SHG and THG measurements exhibit pronounced anisotropy, with emission patterns well-described by theoretical models derived from the khi(2) and khi(3) tensor elements. The material demonstrates exceptionally high nonlinear susceptibilities, with khi(2) ~ 10^(-8) m/V and khi(3) ~ 10^(-17) m^2/V^2 which is a few orders of magnitude greater than comparable 2D materials reported in the literature. Temperature-dependent SHG and THG measurements from 300 K to 25 K reveal exponential decay in harmonic signal intensities, attributed to reduced carrier mobility, with no evidence of structural phase transitions, consistent with results from single crystal diffraction and heat capacity measurements. Polarization-resolved SHG and THG measurements also reveal distinct orientation and ellipticity trends, highlighting the anisotropic nonlinear tensor contributions and contrasting polarization selection rules in the material. These results establish AgScP2S6 as a high-performance, thermally stable, and highly anisotropic nonlinear candidate material suitable for compact photonic applications such as ultrafast optical modulators, polarization-sensitive detectors, and wavelength-tunable light sources.

Title: Equal-spin and opposite-spin density-density correlations in the BCS-BEC crossover: Gauge Symmetry, Pauli Exclusion Principle, Wick's Theorem and Experiments
Authors: Nikolai Kaschewski, Axel Pelster, Carlos A. R. Sá de Melo
Abstract: We develop a general theory of spin-dependent density-density correlations, that is valid for any temperature, interactions, dimensions and mass or population status of Fermi gases with two internal states. We use gauge invariance and the Pauli principle to establish constraints on the spin-dependent density-density correlations that are consistent with the fluctuation-dissipation and Wick's theorem. As an example, we study the spin-dependent density-density correlations from the BCS to the Bose regime in two dimensions at zero temperature, inspired by experiments in 6Li. We show that two-particle irreducible contributions involving collective excitations, many-particle scattering and vertex corrections, are essential to describe experiments. In particular they turn out to be responsible for the emergence of an experimentally observed minimum in the opposite-spin density-density correlations.

Title: Tracking the Lithiation State of Li$_x$Si from Machine-Learned XPS Binding Energies
Authors: Michael Alejandro Hernandez Bertran, Davide Tisi, Federico Grasselli, Michele Ceriotti, Elisa Molinari, Deborah Prezzi
Abstract: X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is a powerful technique to probe chemical states and interfacial processes in battery materials, but a quantitative interpretation is often hindered by the complex, heterogeneous microstructures that form during operation and dominate electrochemical cycling. Silicon based anodes represent a paradigmatic example in Li batteries, as (de)lithiation proceeds through the formation of strongly disordered Li$_x$Si phases and crystal-amorphous transformations that are hard to characterize. Here, we introduce a computational framework that combines machine-learning (ML) prediction of core-level binding energies to large-scale atomistic simulations -- Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) complemented with molecular dynamics (MD), driven by a ML potential -- for a systematic sampling of lithiation states and local atomic environments. This approach yields stoichiometry maps that match the characteristic experimental trends observed in operando and ex situ XPS measurements, including the distinctive Si $2p$ spectroscopic signatures associated with the crystal-to-amorphous disordering driving early delithiation.

Title: Dynamics of neural scaling laws in random feature regression with powerlaw-distributed kernel eigenvalues
Authors: Jakob Kramp, Javed Lindner, Moritz Helias
Abstract: Training large neural networks exposes neural scaling laws for the generalization error, which points to a universal behavior across network architectures of learning in high dimensions. It was also shown that this effect persists in the limit of highly overparametrized networks as well as the Neural network Gaussian process limit. We here develop a principled understanding of the typical behavior of generalization in Neural Network Gaussian process regression dynamics. We derive a dynamical mean-field theory that captures the typical case learning dynamics: This allows us to unify multiple existing regimes of learning studied in the current literature, namely Bayesian inference on Gaussian processes, gradient flow with or without weight-decay, and stochastic Langevin training dynamics. Employing tools from statistical physics, the unified framework we derive in either of these cases yields an effective description of the high-dimensional microscopic behavior of networks dynamics in terms of lower dimensional order parameters. We show that collective training dynamics may be separated into the dynamics of N independent eigenmodes, those evolution equations are only coupled through collective response functions and a common statistics of an effective, independent noise. Our approach allows us to quantitatively explain the dynamics of the generalization error by linking spectral and dynamical properties of learning on data with power law spectra, including phenomena such as neural scaling laws and the effect of early stopping.

Title: $Z_3$ confined and deconfined Coulomb liquids in $S_{\rm eff} = 3/2$ pyrochlore magnets
Authors: Jay Pandey, Souvik Kundu, Kedar Damle
Abstract: We identify an interesting regime in the physics of pyrochlore magnets in which spin-orbit and crystal field effects lead to {\em two} low-lying magnetic doublets that can be modeled as an effective spin $S=3/2$ degree of freedom that sees a dominant easy-axis antiferromagnetic exchange $J>0$ favoring the local $[111]$ axes, which competes with a comparably strong single-ion anisotropy $\Delta = J+\mu/2$ (with $|\mu| \ll J$) favoring the perpendicular planes. For a precise analysis, we study the $T/J \rightarrow 0$ limit in which $w \equiv \exp(-\mu/T)$ is the control variable. In this limit, we find {\em two topologically distinct} zero-field Coulomb phases separated by a first-order $Z_3$ confinement transition at $w_c \approx 2.02$. Both Coulomb phases admit a description in terms of the fluctuations of a coarse-grained divergence-free polarization field. However, the flux of this polarization field is restricted to integer multiples of $3$, and only charges that are multiples of 3 are deconfined in one of these phases, while all integer fluxes are allowed and all integer charges are deconfined in the other phase. Experimental systems with small negative $\mu$ ({\em i.e.}, $-J \ll \mu < 0$) are therefore predicted to exhibit signatures of this topological transition when cooled below $T_c \approx 1.42|\mu|$.

Title: Finite-time thermal refrigerator in interacting Bose-Einstein Condensates

Abstract: We study a finite-time thermodynamic refrigeration cycle realized numerically in three-dimensional, weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). The setup consists of three spatially separated condensates -- system, piston, and reservoir -- coupled through time-dependent potential barriers that implement compression, expansion, and contact strokes. Finite-temperature initial states are generated with the Stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation, and the subsequent dynamics are evolved using the truncated Gross-Pitaevskii equation. To measure temperatures we use a momentum-space thermometry method that provides estimates for each condensate. We find that despite mass transfer and sound excitations, the protocol achieves successful cooling during consecutive cycles: the first cycle lowers its temperature by ~20%, and a second cycle yields additional, though reduced, cooling, reaching a final ~27% cooling from the initial state. Our results show that interacting BECs can sustain finite-time quantum thermal cycles under realistic conditions, and provide a platform for exploring different refrigeration schemes, optimized control protocols, and shortcuts to adiabaticity.

Title: Machine Learning for Electron-phonon Interactions From Finite Difference
Authors: Zun Wang, Wenhui Duan, Zuzhang Lin
Abstract: First-principles investigations of electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) play a crucial role in understanding a wide range of phenomena in physics and materials science. Among various approaches, the finite difference method offers a direct route to capture higher-order EPIs and is compatible with diverse electronic structure solvers. However, its considerable computational cost limits its broader application. To overcome this bottleneck, we present a machine learning electron-phonon interaction (MLEPI) pipeline that predicts force constants and electronic Hamiltonians for modeling EPIs from finite difference calculations, improving efficiency by orders of magnitude without compromising accuracy. The performance of MLEPI is validated by studying the temperature dependence of the electronic band properties in bilayer graphene, where both first- and second order EPIs are treated on an equal footing. Using a heterogeneous edge network, the pipeline integrates both interlayer and intralayer interactions, making it particularly suitable for studying multilayer materials. With its inherent adaptability and ease of transfer to other applications, our methodology provides a robust tool with a very favorable accuracy/efficiency balance for investigating EPIs in large-scale material systems.

Title: Coupling-energy driven pumping through quantum dots: the role of coherences
Authors: Lukas Litzba, Gernot Schaller, Jürgen König, Nikodem Szpak
Abstract: We study the impact of off-resonant tunneling and coherences on the electron pumping through quantum dots. Thereby, we focus on two electron-pump setups where lowest-order tunneling processes are suppressed and the pump is exclusively driven by modulations of the coupling energy. The first setup is driven by switching on and off the couplings between the quantum dot and the leads, while the second setup employs measurements of the dot occupation. We derive exact solutions for arbitrarily strong tunnel couplings in the absence of Coulomb interaction, identify parameter regimes with optimal pumping currents or optimal energy efficiency, and discuss similarities between both pumping mechanisms.

Title: Depth-dependent interplay of dynamical heterogeneity and chain dynamics at the surface of glass-forming polymers
Authors: Bao T. Ma, David S. Simmons
Abstract: Polymer thin films exhibit pronounced interfacial mobility gradients that modify chain relaxation, yet how these gradients govern chain-scale dynamics across depth remains incompletely understood. Using molecular dynamics simulations of freestanding glass-forming polymer films, we resolve how depth-dependent variations in segmental relaxation shape chain dynamics across a wide range of displacement scales. Near the free surface, accelerated segmental mobility suppresses Rouse-regime scaling exponents to values as low as gamma = 0.4, reflecting transient localization induced by interfacial mobility gradients rather than topological entanglement. In contrast, the film interior exhibits enhanced Rouse scaling exponents consistent with predictions of the Heterogeneous Rouse Model (HRM), indicating that bulk dynamic heterogeneity compresses the Rouse regime. Mapping the minimum scaling exponent gamma_min across depth reveals a linear gradient that separates the bulk-like enhancement regime from the surface-induced suppression regime of chain dynamical scaling. Together, these results demonstrate that bulk and interfacial dynamic heterogeneity modify chain relaxation in opposite ways and establish Rouse scaling as a sensitive, spatially resolved probe of glassy dynamical heterogeneity and interfacial dynamical gradients in polymers.

Title: Thermodynamic uncertainty relation under continuous measurement and feedback with quantum-classical-transfer entropy
Authors: Kaito Tojo, Takahiro Sagawa, Ken Funo
Abstract: We derive a thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) under quantum continuous measurement and feedback control. By incorporating the quantum-classical-transfer entropy, which quantifies the information gained by continuous measurement, we show that the precision of currents is constrained by information-thermodynamic costs such as the entropy production and information gain. Our result shows that information gain has the potential to enhance the precision of currents beyond the bounds set by the conventional TUR. We illustrate the bound with a driven two-level system under continuous measurement and feedback, demonstrating that feedback achieves higher precision of currents while suppressing the entropy production.

Title: A Maxwell Fish-Eye Lens in a Bose-Einstein Condensate
Authors: Jelte Duchêne, Elinor Kath, Floriane Arrouas, Hanyi Jang, Helmut Strobel, Markus K. Oberthaler, Jay Mehta, Liam M. Farrell, Wyatt Kirkby, Duncan H.J. O'Dell
Abstract: We experimentally realize an analogue of the optical Maxwell fish-eye lens (MFEL) using phononic excitations in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). A MFEL is characterized by a radially symmetric, spatially varying refractive index with the remarkable property that rays emitted from any point within the lens are perfectly focused at their image points. While the implementation of such gradient-index lenses is challenging in conventional optical systems, BECs offer a highly tunable platform in which the spatially varying speed of sound of collective excitations -- phonons, the acoustic-wave analogues of photons -- can be engineered and their dynamics observed in real time. Time-resolved measurements of phonon wavefronts reveal focusing behavior that shows good agreement with analytical theory and numerical simulations. This work provides both a geometric and physical framework for engineering effective refractive indices using ultracold atoms, and simulating wave propagation on effective spherical geometries.

Title: Landau level spectroscopy in current solid state physics
Authors: Ana Akrap, Milan Orlita
Abstract: Landau level spectroscopy plays an important role in modern condensed-matter physics. In this technique, electrons in a solid are subjected to quantizing magnetic fields and probed experimentally, often through optical methods. Direct and detailed insights into the electronic properties of crystalline materials are obtained, particularly the properties related to their band structure. Landau level spectroscopy enables the precise extraction of key parameters such as effective mass, carrier density, mobility, and band gap, and serves as a powerful tool for studying interactions between electrons and other quasiparticles in solids. Over its more than seventy-year history, Landau level spectroscopy has been applied mainly to semiconductors and semimetals. Today, its scope also includes graphene-based systems, surface and bulk states in topological materials, and other emergent systems with a narrow or vanishing band gap. In this work, we review the fundamentals of Landau level spectroscopy and illustrate them with selected examples from the literature.

Title: Engineering in-plane anisotropy in 2D materials via surface-bound ligands
Authors: Tomoaki Sakurada, Woo Seok Lee, Yeongsu Cho, Rattapon Khamlue, Petcharaphorn Chatsiri, Nicholas Samulewicz, Tejas Deshpande, Annlin Su, Peter Müller, Tadashi Kawamoto, Shun Omagari, Martin Vacha, Watcharaphol Paritmongkol, Heather J. Kulik, William A. Tisdale
Abstract: 2D materials exhibiting in-plane anisotropy enable novel functionality in electronic, optoelectronic, and photonic devices, yet their availability is generally limited to naturally-occurring low-symmetry van der Waals compounds. Here, we demonstrate an approach to structural engineering in a family of blue-emitting 2D silver phenylchalcogenide semiconductors based on steric interactions among surface-bound organic molecular ligands. By strategically halogenating specific sites of phenyl ligands, we demonstrate dramatic changes to the inorganic AgSe plane in mithrene (silver phenylselenolate, AgSePh). Density functional theory revealed pronounced in-plane electronic anisotropy for direct-gap fluorinated derivatives, while a chlorinated variant exhibited a direct-to-indirect bandgap transition. Furthermore, some fluorinated variants displayed strongly polarized absorption and luminescence, accompanied by a 10x enhancement in photoluminescence quantum yield. This work establishes a versatile approach for tailoring optoelectronic properties in hybrid semiconductors that is difficult or impossible to achieve in all-inorganic materials alone, offering new opportunities in advanced material design.

Title: Rheological properties and shear-induced structures of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals
Authors: Ashish Chandra Das, Sathyanarayana Paladugu, Oleg D. Lavrentovich
Abstract: Recently discovered ferroelectric nematic (NF) liquid crystals are fluids with a polar orientational order. The electric polarization vector can be aligned by an electric field and by surface anchoring. Here, we explore how the polarization field and effective viscosity of the NF materials are affected by shear flows. We explore three NF materials, abbreviated RM734, DIO, and a room-temperature FNLC919, all of which exhibit a paraelectric nematic (N) and the NF phase. All materials show an increase of the viscosity upon cooling, with an Arrhenius behavior. In DIO and FNLC919, the antiferroelectric SmZA phase shows a strong dependence of the effective viscosity on the shear rate: this viscosity is lower than the viscosity of the N and NF phases at high shear rates but is much higher when the shear rate is low. The behavior is associated with the layered structure of the SmZA phase. All mesophases exhibit shear-thinning behavior at low shear rates and a nearly Newtonian behavior at higher shear rates. In terms of alignment, we observe three regimes in the N and NF phases: flow-alignment at low shear rates, log-rolling regime with the director and polarization along the vorticity axis at high shear rates, and polydomain structures at intermediate rates. In the flow-aligning regime, the NF polarization does not tilt away from the shear direction, which is in sharp contrast to the flow-induced tilt of the N director. The effect is attributed to the avoidance of splay deformations and associated space charge in the flowing NF. The temperature and shear rate dependencies of the viscosity and the uncovered shear-induced structural effects of NF advance our understanding of these materials and potentially facilitate their applications.

Title: Persistence-Driven Void Formation in Active-Passive Mixtures
Authors: Giulia Janzen, Liesbeth M. C. Janssen, Nuno A.M. Araújo, Rastko Sknepnek, D. A. Matoz-Fernandez
Abstract: It is well established that dilute active dopants can melt an arrested amorphous solid by enhancing cage breaking and accelerating structural relaxation. Yet it remains unclear whether increasing persistence simply amplifies this effective melting or instead reorganizes the fluidization mechanism itself. Here we show that, in a minimal active-passive mixture, increasing persistence drives a crossover from homogeneous fluidization to a localized mechanical instability, demonstrating that sustained active forcing restructures relaxation in space rather than merely strengthening it. Persistent dopants accumulate stress and nucleate voids as their mechanically perturbed regions overlap. In this regime, rearrangements localize at void boundaries, and active and passive particles exhibit comparable mobility, producing dynamics reminiscent of crowd mosh pits. Persistence therefore reorganizes fluidization through stress accumulation and confinement, revealing a distinct nonequilibrium localization mechanism in disordered solids.

Title: Extended Ashkin-Teller transition in two coupled frustrated Haldane chains
Authors: Bowy M. La Rivière, Natalia Chepiga
Abstract: We report an extremely rich ground state phase diagram of two spin-1 Haldane chains frustrated with a three-site exchange and coupled by the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction on a zig-zag ladder. A particular feature of the phase diagram is the extended quantum phase transition in the Ashkin-Teller universality class that separates the plaquette phase, which spontaneously breaks translation symmetry, and the uniform disordered phase. The former is connected to the Haldane phase, stabilized by large inter-chain coupling, via the topological Gaussian transition. Upon decreasing the inter-chain interactions, this intermediate disorder phase vanishes, giving place to a dimerized phase separated from the plaquette phase on one side via a non-magnetic Ising transition and from the Haldane phase on the other side by a topological weak first-order transition. Finally, in the limit of two decoupled chains, we recover a quantum critical point that corresponds to two copies of the Wess-Zumino-Witten $\mathrm{SU(2)}_2$ criticality with a total central charge $c=3$.

Title: Dimensional and doping stability of Peierls charge density waves
Authors: Aitor Garcia-Ruiz, Che-pin Hsu, Ming-Hao Liu, Marcin Mucha-Kruczynski
Abstract: The Peierls instability, the spontaneous dimerization of a one-dimensional metallic chain at half filling, is a paradigmatic mechanism for charge-density-wave (CDW) formation. Here we test its robustness under finite doping and interchain hybridization in finite-thickness arrays of identical chains. We find that the stacking geometry plays a decisive role in stabilizing CDW order away from half filling. In particular, parallel-coupled chains exhibit a bistable regime where the normal and dimerized states coexist as local minima of the total energy, while skew-coupled chains display reentrant CDW order upon doping. Our results demonstrate that even minimal models of coupled atomic chains host rich phase diagrams controlled by doping, lattice rigidity, and interchain coupling geometry.

Title: Mesoscopic fluctuation theory of particle systems driven by Poisson noise: study of the $q$-TASEP
Authors: Alexandre Krajenbrink, Pierre Le Doussal
Abstract: We pursue our study of integrable weak noise theories of directed polymer and interacting particle stochastic models in the 1D KPZ universality class. Here we focus on the $q$-TASEP in either continuous or discrete time. Each particle on $\mathbb{Z}$ jumps independently by $+1$ with a rate (or probability) depending on the gap to the next particle on its right. We consider initial conditions (either step or random) which are empty of particles on $\mathbb{Z}^+$, and focus on the dynamics of the $N$ rightmost particles. In the limit $q \to 1$ and at large time (and large gaps) we identify a new intermediate "mesoscopic" (i.e. finite $N$) regime which corresponds to weak noise. In that regime Poisson noise remains important. We obtain the large deviations of the position of a given particle by two methods. The first derives asymptotics of $q$-TASEP Fredholm determinant formula. The second maps the weak noise limit to a system of semi-discrete or fully discrete, non linear differential equations. These are obtained as saddle point classical equations of a dynamical field theory, and their solutions represent the optimal configurations in the large deviation regime. We show the classical integrability of these two systems, and exhibit their explicit Lax pair. In the case of the continuous time $q$-TASEP it provides the first instance of classical integrability arising in a stochastic system, with signatures of the Poisson noise persisting in the weak noise limit. For this model, we solve the scattering problem associated to its Lax pair and fully characterize the large deviations associated to the weak noise theory. Finally, we supplement this work with an Appendix on the first cumulant method to obtain the large deviations of several lattice polymer models (Strict Weak, Log Gamma, Beta).

Title: Efficient training of generative models from multireference simulations and its application to the design of Dy complexes with large magnetic anisotropy
Authors: Zahra Khatibi, Lorenzo A. Mariano, Lion Frangoulis, Alessandro Lunghi
Abstract: Generative machine learning models can potentially provide direct access to novel and relevant portions of the full chemical space, overcoming the cost of systematic sampling. However, the training of these models generally requires a large amount of data, often precluding the use of expensive high-level ab initio simulations for this task. The generation of coordination compounds of Dy with large magnetic anisotropy represents a topical example, where multireference simulations of large molecules are necessary to perform reliable predictions. Here, we show that a semi-supervised chemically-inspired training-by-proxy of generative variational autoencoders can reduce the cost associated with building a training set from multireference simulations by two orders of magnitude. We illustrate the power of this approach by generating 100s of new organic ligands for Dy(III) pentagonal bipyramidal complexes exhibiting record values of magnetic anisotropy, while starting from datasets as small as 1k multireference calculations. This work thus paves the way to the computational generation of molecules as complex coordination compounds with target electronic and magnetic properties.

Title: Threefold error in the reported zero-field cooled magnetic moment of single crystal $La_2SmNi_2O_7$
Authors: Aleksandr V. Korolev, Evgeny F. Talantsev
Abstract: For a relatively long time, the observation of the DC diamagnetic state in highly compressed nickelate superconductors [1],[2] has been a challenging experimental problem. And recently Li et al.[3] reported on the measurements of the DC diamagnetism in zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) pressurized single crystal $La_2SmNi_2O_7$. From the analysis of experimental data, Li et al.[3] reported that the superconducting phase fraction in their $La_2SmNi_2O_7$ sample measured in the ZFC mode is 62.1%, and the superconducting phase fraction in the FC mode is 14.4%. It should be clarified that we regard the measurements of the DC diamagnetic state [3] in $La_2SmNi_2O_7$ (and more recently in $Pr_4Ni_3O_{10}$ [4]) as outstanding experimental results confirming bulk superconductivity in pressurized nickelates. However, we should note that Li et al.[3] made a threefold error in their calculations of the superconducting phase fraction in $La_2SmNi_2O_7$. We believe that correcting this and other errors in Ref.[3] will benefit the physics community.

Title: Accounting for the length-scale dependence of thermal diffusivity in 3C-SiC measured with transient thermal gratings
Authors: Keshav Vasudeva, Samuel Huberman, Angus P.C. Wylie, Maxwell Rae, Joey Demiane, Jamal A. Haibeh, Elena Botica-Artalejo, Kevin B. Woller, Michael P. Short, Sara E. Ferry
Abstract: Pump-probe optical methods like transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) enable rapid, nondestructive thermoelastic property measurements. But, in phonon-dominated ceramics, they can underpredict bulk thermal diffusivity when long mean free path (MFP) phonons do not equilibrate over experimental length scales. We combine in situ TGS with Si4+ ion irradiation of CVD 3C-SiC (300 and 550C, 0.5-1 dpa) and density functional theory informed Boltzmann transport equation solutions to understand the origins of this offset. We show how the discrepancy between laser flash analysis (LFA) and TGS-measured thermal diffusivity varies with grain-boundary density, temperature, and defect concentration. We introduce a dimensionless suppression factor that accounts for this discrepancy and demonstrate its utility by using it to show an agreement between the thermal defect resistance of neutron irradiated 3C-SiC (measured using LFA) and ion irradiated 3C-SiC (measured using TGS). This theory-informed experimental framework enables quantitative, in situ tracking of ion irradiation damage induced thermal transport degradation in ceramics.

Title: Extrinsic Spin Splitter Currents in Altermagnets
Authors: Sanjay Sarkar, Sayan Sarkar, Amit Agarwal
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting despite having zero net magnetization. This enables a spin-splitter effect in which an external electric field generates transverse spin currents by separating oppositely polarized carriers. Here, we develop a unified semiclassical theory of linear extrinsic spin-splitter currents, incorporating impurity-induced side-jump and skew-scattering contributions, and apply it to the $d$-wave altermagnet \ch{FeSb2}. We demonstrate that asymmetric impurity scattering provides a dominant channel for spin-splitter currents. Remarkably, the resulting extrinsic spin conductivity is time-reversal even, in contrast to previously studied spin-splitter responses arising from symmetric scattering.

Title: Electromechanical Switching and Momentum-Selective Transport in Geometry-Defined Blue Phosphorus Homojunctions
Authors: Zewen Wu, Min Zhou, Yanxia Xing, Xianghua Kong
Abstract: Developing intrinsic homojunctions without chemical heterogeneity remains a key challenge in future two - dimensional devices. Here, we report a geometry - defined metal--semiconductor--metal homojunction in bilayer blue phosphorus (BlueP) created by a localized bubble corrugation, without chemical doping or foreign - material interfaces. First - principles calculations show that enlarging the interlayer separation in the metallic A\(_1\)B\(_1\) - stacked BlueP bilayer opens a band gap, enabling a semiconducting barrier embedded between metallic segments. First - principles quantum - transport simulations reveal a crossover from ballistic to tunneling transport upon bubble formation. In the tunneling regime, transmission decreases exponentially with bubble width while remaining weakly sensitive to bubble height and bulging direction. The junction acts as an orientation - dependent \(k\) - space filter, producing transport anisotropy and momentum selectivity. Orbital - resolved scattering analysis shows that intralayer - bonding channels persist under deformation whereas interlayer - hybridized channels are quenched, and that \sigma - type bonding yields higher conductance than \pi - type bonding. These insights motivate two electromechanical device concepts: a mechanically switchable memory element with ON/OFF ratios up to 30 and a nanoscale sliding rheostat with reproducible exponential resistance tuning for Å- scale displacement sensing.

Title: Magnetic order and excitations in Ce$_3$TiBi$_5$ and Ce$_3$ZrBi$_5$
Authors: Pyeongjae Park, Qianli Ma, Wei Tian, Stuart Calder, Matthias Frontzek, G. Sala, D. Mandrus, Shirin Mozaffari, Andrew D. Christianson, Matthew B. Stone
Abstract: The R3MBi5 rare-earth intermetallics (R = rare earth, M = Ti, Zr, Sc) provide a versatile platform to explore how Kondo hybridization, RKKY exchange, magnetic frustration, and broken inversion symmetry may cooperate to generate unusual magnetic behavior. We present a comprehensive neutron scattering investigation of the magnetic structure, crystal electric field (CEF), and low-energy excitations in the locally noncentrosymmetric Kondo-lattice compounds Ce3TiBi5 and Ce3ZrBi5. Powder and single-crystal neutron diffraction reveals incommensurate cycloidal antiferromagnetic order in Ce3TiBi5 with propagation vector k = (0, 0, 0.388) and a reduced ordered moment of m = 0.53(3)$\mu_{B}$. Ce3ZrBi5 exhibits a qualitatively similar magnetic diffraction profile, with k $\simeq$ (0, 0, 0.37). Inelastic neutron scattering measurements resolve two clear, well-separated CEF excitations in both compounds with nearly the same profile, confirming a well-isolated Kramers doublet ground state. At low energies, a broad, quasi-elastic magnetic response is observed at T $\simeq$ TN, whose momentum-dependence is inconsistent with that expected from conventional collective excitations of localized moments. This discrepancy, along with a Kondo temperature estimate TK ~ 3--5 K -- comparable to TN -- indicates sizable Kondo hybridization, which accounts for the moment reduction and the spiral magnetic order that appears to involve the magnetic hard direction. Our results place these compounds in a regime where local inversion symmetry breaking, anisotropic CEF effects, and competing Kondo and RKKY interactions collectively give rise to unconventional magnetic order.

Title: Memory-induced active particle ratchets: Mean currents and large deviations
Authors: Venkata D. Pamulaparthy, Rosemary J. Harris
Abstract: We analyse a continuous-time random walk model with stochastic reversals of direction. There is no external potential but the reorientation mechanism generates a non-zero current from asymmetry in the forward and backward waiting-time distributions (even when they have the same mean); the system can therefore can be considered as a type of active particle ratchet. We derive an explicit expression for the mean ratchet current with exponentially distributed reorientation times and also develop a general renewal-theory framework to obtain the full large deviations, using this to comment on the possibility of dynamical phase transitions.

Abstract: Tin selenide (SnSe) is a van der Waals (vdW) layered post-transition metal monochalcogenide compound which is promising for a wide range of device applications when its thickness is reduced to a few layers. Hence, developing a mature synthesis technique to obtain wafer-scale, high-quality ultrathin SnSe layers is crucial. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the effect of growth parameters on the material quality of ultrathin SnSe thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. A growth window including substrate temperature of 210-270°C and low Se/Sn flux ratio with Se valve position of 10-30 mils has been identified which results in SnSe films with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness as low as 0.6 nm and full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.1° in SnSe (400) x-ray diffraction (XRD) rocking curve. Finally, using a three-step growth approach, we demonstrate wafer-scale coalesced ultrathin SnSe layers with thicknesses from 20 nm down to 5 nm, with good crystallinity, structural quality, and surface morphology. This work establishes a growth condition framework for MBE-grown SnSe and presents a viable route for developing wafer-scale single-layer films, unlocking the potential of this highly promising material for advanced device integration.

Title: Arrested Relaxation in a Disorder-Free Coulomb Spin Liquid
Authors: Souvik Kundu, Arnab Seth, Sthitadhi Roy, Subhro Bhattacharjee, Roderich Moessner
Abstract: We investigate Coulomb spin liquids in classical spin-3/2 ice and show that the enlarged on-site Hilbert space gives rise to a qualitatively new class of such phases. Beyond the conventional magnetic monopoles of spin-1/2 ice, the system hosts additional low-energy crystal-field excitations, whose interplay with monopoles significantly modifies both equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties. Following a thermal quench, we find a pronounced dynamical arrest manifested in an exponentially long-lived {athermal} plateau in spin autocorrelations. This constitutes a rare example of dynamical arrest in a short-range interacting, disorder-free system. We demonstrate that the arrested dynamics originate from novel composite excitation structures unique to spin-3/2 ice and from kinetically constrained relaxation pathways that require activated processes. Our results establish higher-spin ice as a fertile platform for realising unconventional Coulomb spin liquids and dynamical arrest without quenched disorder.

Title: Zatom-1: A Multimodal Flow Foundation Model for 3D Molecules and Materials
Authors: Alex Morehead, Miruna Cretu, Antonia Panescu, Rishabh Anand, Maurice Weiler, Tynan Perez, Samuel Blau, Steven Farrell, Wahid Bhimji, Anubhav Jain, Hrushikesh Sahasrabuddhe, Pietro Lio, Tommi Jaakkola, Rafael Gomez-Bombarelli, Rex Ying, N. Benjamin Erichson, Michael W. Mahoney
Abstract: General-purpose 3D chemical modeling encompasses molecules and materials, requiring both generative and predictive capabilities. However, most existing AI approaches are optimized for a single domain (molecules or materials) and a single task (generation or prediction), which limits representation sharing and transfer. We introduce Zatom-1, the first foundation model that unifies generative and predictive learning of 3D molecules and materials. Zatom-1 is a Transformer trained with a multimodal flow matching objective that jointly models discrete atom types and continuous 3D geometries. This approach supports scalable pretraining with predictable gains as model capacity increases, while enabling fast and stable sampling. We use joint generative pretraining as a universal initialization for downstream multi-task prediction of properties, energies, and forces. Empirically, Zatom-1 matches or outperforms specialized baselines on both generative and predictive benchmarks, while reducing the generative inference time by more than an order of magnitude. Our experiments demonstrate positive predictive transfer between chemical domains from joint generative pretraining: modeling materials during pretraining improves molecular property prediction accuracy.

Title: Taxonomy of Integrable and Ground-State Solvable Models: Jastrow Wavefunctions on Graphs and Parent Hamiltonians
Authors: Nilanjan Sasmal, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: We introduce a family of many-body systems of distinguishable continuous-variable particles in which interparticle interactions are set by the adjacency matrix of a graph. The ground-state wavefunction of such systems is of a generalized Jastrow form involving the product of pair-correlation functions over the edge set of the graph. These systems describe quantum fluids when the graph is complete, and the pair function has a well-defined permutation symmetry. In general, they provide the continuous-variable generalization of spin systems on graphs, with broken permutation symmetry. The corresponding parent Hamiltonian is shown to include (a) two-body interactions determined by the graph adjacency matrix and (b) three-body interactions over all possible 2-paths on the graph. Employing elements of graph theory, we chart the landscape of models, recovering known instances in the literature and providing numerous new examples of ground-state solvable models for which the system Hamiltonian, ground-state wavefunction, and corresponding energy eigenvalue are specified.

Title: Partial Reversibility and Counterdiabatic Driving in Nearly Integrable Systems
Authors: Rohan Banerjee, Shahyad Khamnei, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Stewart Morawetz
Abstract: Adiabatic (or reversible) processes are the key concept unifying our understanding of thermodynamics and dynamical systems. Reversibility in the thermodynamic sense is understood as entropy-preserving processes, such as in the idealized Carnot engine, whereas in integrable dynamical systems it is understood as the conservation of the action variables. Between these two idealized limits, however, where the phase space can become mixed, things are much less clear. In this work, we first determine the extent to which reversible processes are even possible in this regime. We then explore how the dissipative losses resulting from rapidly driving these kinds of systems can be fought by approximate counterdiabatic driving. Finally, we argue that much of the phenomenology should be the same for quantum many-body systems with large degeneracy in the presence of integrability breaking perturbations.

Title: Symmetry-protected control of Liouvillian topological phases via Hamiltonian band topology
Authors: Shu Long, Chao Yang, Sen Mu, Linhu Li
Abstract: We establish a symmetry-protected correspondence between band topology of coherent Hamiltonians and Liouvillian spectral winding in Lindblad descriptions of open quantum systems. This allows the Hamiltonian topology to act as a knob for controlling Liouvillian topology and corresponding non-equilibrium dynamics, rather than being passively manipulated by system-environment exchanges. In particular, by exactly solving the Liouvillian spectrum in a class of one-dimensional dissipative lattices, we find that the Hamiltonian band topology constrains the Liouvillian spectral winding and determines the Liouvillian skin effect, provided the Hamiltonian and quantum jump operators respect the same chiral symmetry. We further demonstrate that lattice parity controls the associated bulk-boundary correspondence and the coherence properties of the steady state. Our results unveil a symmetry-enforced topological control of spectral and spatial organization in open quantum systems, providing a unified perspective on topology in Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics.

Title: Schwinger-Keldysh field theory for operator Rényi entropy and entanglement growth in non-interacting systems with sub-ballistic transports
Authors: Priesh Roy, Sumilan Banerjee
Abstract: The notion of operator growth in quantum systems furnishes a bridge between transport and the generation of entanglement between different parts of the system under quantum dynamics. We define a measure of operator growth in terms of subsystem operator Rényi entropy, which provides a state-independent measure of operator growth, unlike entanglement entropies, and the usual measures of operator growth like out-of-time-order correlators. We show that the subsystem operator Rényi entropy encodes both spatial and temporal information, and thus can directly connect to transport for a local operator related to a conserved quantity. We construct a unified Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory formalism for the time evolution of operator Rényi entropy and entanglement entropies of initial pure states. We use the SK field theory to obtain the operator Rényi and state entanglement entropies in terms of infinite-temperature and vacuum Keldysh Green's functions, respectively, for non-interacting systems. We apply the method to explore the connection between operator and entanglement growth, and transport in non-interacting systems with quasiperiodic and random disorder, like the one- and two-dimensional Aubry-André models and the two-dimensional Anderson model. In particular, we show that the growth of subsystem operator Rényi entropy and state von Neumann and Rényi entanglement entropies can capture both ballistic and sub-ballistic transport behaviors, like diffusive and anomalous diffusive transport, as well as localization in these systems.

Title: Resurgence in the Virasoro Minimal String and 3d Gravity
Authors: Maximilian Schwick
Abstract: We compute non-perturbative, resurgent contributions to the Virasoro minimal string and 3d gravity using techniques from hermitian matrix models. In particular, we construct a fully non-perturbative partition function for the Virasoro minimal string in terms of a Zak transform. In this context, negative tension D-branes appear naturally, which in the matrix model correspond to anti-eigenvalues, or instantons on the involuted sheet of the spectral curve. We further extend this analysis to resolvents and observe resurgent wall crossing phenomena between ZZ- and FZZT-branes. Using recent results that relate the Virasoro minimal string to 3d gravity with end-of-the-world branes we proceed to study the resurgent consequences of summing over the genus in 3d gravity, where we find non-perturbative contributions of doubly exponential type. These statements are then tested using resurgent large-order asymptotics. Lastly, we compute the non-perturbative eigenvalue density for generic hermitian matrix models and identify the change of asymptotic behavior at the edge of the eigenvalue distribution with a Stokes transition. This allows us to identify oscillations in the eigenvalue density with anti-Stokes behavior of FZZT-branes. In the case of 3d gravity with end-of-the-world branes we comment how this Stokes transition coincides with the onset of black hole behaviour and compute the non-perturbative primary density. Furthermore, we apply these techniques to the eigenvalue density of JT gravity to compute higher genus corrections.

Title: Numerical Experiments with Parameter Setting of Trotterized Quantum Phase Estimation for Quantum Hamiltonian Ground State Computation
Authors: Elijah Pelofske, Stephan Eidenbenz
Abstract: We numerically investigate quantum circuit elementary-gate level instantiations of the standard Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm for the task of computing the ground-state energy of a quantum magnet; the disordered fully-connected quantum Heisenberg spin glass model. We consider (classical simulations of) QPE circuit computations on relatively small quantum Hamiltonians ($3$ qubits) with up to $10$ phase bits of precision, using up to Trotter order $10$. We systematically study the inputs of QPE, specifically time evolution, Trotter order, Trotter steps, and initial state, and illustrate how these inputs practically determine how QPE operates. From this we outline a coherent set of quantum algorithm input and tuning guidelines. One of the notable properties we characterize is that QPE sampling of the optimal digitized phase converges to a fixed rate. This results in strong diminishing returns of optimal phase sampling rates which can occur when the Trotter error is surprisingly high.

Title: Adaptive Patching for Tensor Train Computations
Authors: Gianluca Grosso, Marc K. Ritter, Stefan Rohshap, Samuel Badr, Anna Kauch, Markus Wallerberger, Jan von Delft, Hiroshi Shinaoka
Abstract: Quantics Tensor Train (QTT) operations such as matrix product operator contractions are prohibitively expensive for large bond dimensions. We propose an adaptive patching scheme that exploits block-sparse QTT structures to reduce costs through divide-and-conquer, adaptively partitioning tensors into smaller patches with reduced bond dimensions. We demonstrate substantial improvements for sharply localized functions and show efficient computation of bubble diagrams and Bethe-Salpeter equations, opening the door to practical large-scale QTT-based computations previously beyond reach.

Title: A Reduced Order Model approach for First-Principles Molecular Dynamics Computations
Authors: Siu Wun Cheung, Youngsoo Choi, Jean-Luc Fattebert, Jonas Kaufman, Daniel Osei-Kuffuor
Abstract: To leverage the redundancy between the electronic structure computed at each step of first-principles molecular dynamics, we present a data-driven modeling framework for Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory that bypasses the explicit optimization of electronic wavefunctions. We sample a priori representative atomic configurations and construct a low-dimensional basis that efficiently approximates the electronic structure subspace. Subsequently, we employ this reduced basis in a direct solver for the electronic single particle density matrix, thereby enabling the efficient determination of ground state without iterative wavefunction optimization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics of a water molecule, showing that the resulting simulations accurately reproduce key structural properties, such as bond lengths and bond angle, obtained from full first-principles molecular dynamics. This work highlights the potential of data-driven approaches to develop efficient electronic structure solvers for first-principles simulations.

Title: Macroscopic Quantum Electrodynamics with Gain: Modified Fluctuations and Their Consequences
Authors: Daigo Oue
Abstract: Macroscopic quantum electrodynamics (MQED) provides a unified framework to describe quantum electromagnetic fields in the presence of arbitrary macroscopic environments. Central to this theory is the field correlation, which governs both radiative (e.g., Lamb shifts and the Purcell effect) and mechanical phenomena, such as van der Waals and Casimir forces. In this tutorial, we provide an overview of MQED and its extension to active media, highlighting fluctuation-induced forces as manifestations of gain-modified field correlations.

Title: Kelvin wave and soliton propagation in classical viscous vortex filaments
Authors: Elio Sterkers, Giorgio Krstulovic
Abstract: Vortex filaments are highly rotating localized structures of fluids that admits several types of excitation. Here, we study them by using numerical simulations of the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We first address the propagation of Kelvin waves, helicoidal excitations propagating along the filament, and measure their dispersion relation which turns out to be in good agreement with the original Lord Kelvin predictions. Then, inspired by the connection between vortex line dynamics and an integrable system, we show numerically the existence of solitons propagating along vortex filaments and study the collision of two of such structures. Finally, we show numerically the experimental feasibility of studying vortex solitons in the lab, by proposing an experiment for their generation.

Title: Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation with Quantum Feedback
Authors: Ryotaro Honma, Tan Van Vu
Abstract: Fluctuations are intrinsic to microscopic systems and impose fundamental limits on nonequilibrium precision, as captured by the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), which links current fluctuations to entropy production. While feedback control is expected to further suppress fluctuations, its role within the TUR framework has remained unclear, particularly in quantum systems where control is inherently information-driven. In this Letter, we consider open quantum systems weakly coupled to a thermal environment, in which quantum jumps are continuously monitored, and Markovian feedback is applied. Using quantum mutual information to quantify the information contribution induced by feedback, we derive a finite-time TUR for arbitrary time-integrated currents in terms of entropy production and mutual information. Our results uncover how feedback control suppresses fluctuations together with thermodynamic cost and establishes a fundamental precision bound imposed by information-based control. As an application, we analyze a quantum clock model and demonstrate that the clock precision can be enhanced by feedback control in the presence of a single thermal reservoir.

Title: Generating entangled polaritonic condensates by pumping with entangled pairs of photons
Authors: N.A. Asriyan, A.A. Elistratov, A.V. Kavokin
Abstract: We investigate the steady state of two single-mode uniform spatially separated polaritonic conden- sates exposed to resonant pumping with entangled pairs of photons. We demonstrate the principal possibility of driving the system to an entangled state despite its exposure to noises arising from the excitonic reservoir and photon leakage through the microcavity mirrors. Estimates are provided for the flux of entangled particles required to drive the system into a steady state that violates the partial-transpose criterion for entanglement. Furthermore, we trace the evolution of the system after a sudden disappearance of the entangled pumping. Our analysis provides estimates for the entanglement lifetime in a system of two exciton-polariton condensates

Title: (1+1)-Dimensional Schrödinger-Poisson equation with contact interaction
Authors: Óscar Rodríguez-Villalba, Ivan Saychenko, Massimo Pietroni, Sandro Wimberger
Abstract: We investigate the role of contact interactions in the dynamics of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) modeled through the Schrödinger-Poisson equation in one spatial dimension. While the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm successfully explains structure formation on large scales, its small-scale predictions remain in tension with observations. FDM offers an alternative framework, where local self-interactions can further influence the formation and evolution of structures. We explore both attractive and repulsive contact interactions in static and expanding backgrounds. Using numerical simulations, we examine their impact on three key scenarios: the properties of the lowest-energy stationary solution, the relaxation of localized initial states, and the gravitational collapse of nonlocalized states. Our results show that contact interactions modify the density profile of the stationary solution and affect the onset of characteristic stages of gravitational collapse, particularly the shell-crossing event. In the (1+1) model, we confirm that relaxation does not converge to the lowest-energy stationary solution, even when local self-interactions are included. Taken together, local self-interactions play a relevant role in shaping the nonlinear dynamics of FDM and motivate further studies in higher-dimensional and cosmologically realistic settings.

Title: Demonstrating Single Photon Counting with Kinetic Inductance Detectors from 3.8 to 25 $μ$m
Authors: Wilbert G. Ras-Vinke, Kevin Kouwenhoven, Jochem J.A. Baselmans, Kenichi Karatsu, David J. Thoen, Vignesh Murugesan, Pieter J. de Visser
Abstract: One of the primary objectives of modern astronomy is the atmospheric characterization of Earth-like exoplanets at visible and infrared wavelengths. Achieving this goal requires extremely sensitive detectors capable of measuring faint signal of the exoplanet at the single-photon level while maintaining near-zero dark count rates. In the infrared, however, conventional semiconducting detector technologies struggle to meet these stringent requirements. In this work we demonstrate single-photon counting with superconducting Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors at the wavelengths 3.8, 8.5, 18.5, and 25 $\mu$m and measure resolving powers ($E/\delta E$) of 9.9, 5.9, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively, with corresponding dark count rates of 4, 8, 34, and 48 mHz. Our membrane-based devices reach phonon-loss limited performance at 3.8 $\mu$m, more than doubling the performance attainable with comparable solid-substrate devices. These results showcase the detector technology in the mid-infrared and the intricate measurement setup required for these sensitive detectors. We discuss how the detector design and measurement setup can be further optimized to increase the detector performance in the mid-infrared.

Title: Symmetric Mass Generation via Multicriticality in a 3D Lattice Gross-Neveu Model
Authors: Sandip Maiti, Debasish Banerjee, Shailesh Chandrasekharan, Marina K. Marinkovic
Abstract: We investigate a three-dimensional lattice model of two flavors of massless staggered fermions coupled through two independent four-fermion interactions, $U_I$ and $U_B$. Using large-scale fermion-bag Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram in the $(U_I, U_B)$ parameter space and identify three distinct phases: a massless fermion phase, a symmetry-broken massive phase, and a symmetric massive phase. When one of the interactions is absent ($U_B=0$), the system undergoes a single continuous transition directly connecting the massless and symmetric massive phases, a feature previously associated with unconventional fermion mass generation. We find that turning on a nonzero $U_B$ separates this direct transition into two successive transitions with an intermediate symmetry-broken phase. The transition from the massless to the broken phase belongs to the Gross-Neveu universality class, while the transition from the broken to the symmetric massive phase falls into the three-dimensional XY universality class. Our results indicate that the special point at vanishing coupling, where the direct transition occurs, plays the role of a multicritical point organizing the surrounding phase structure. These findings provide a unified lattice perspective on conventional and unconventional mechanisms of fermion mass generation within a single model.

Title: Collective Dynamics in Spiking Neural Networks Beyond Dale's Principle
Authors: Ross Ah-Weng, Hardik Rajpal
Abstract: Dale's Principle has historically guided neuroscience research as a valuable rule of thumb, namely that all synapses on each neuron release the same set of neurotransmitters. Most existing Spiking Neuron Network models share this dichotomous assumption that neurons are either excitatory or inhibitory; however, recent experimental evidence points towards co-release mechanisms that violate this assumption. Here, we introduce a minimal model of "Bilingual" neurons violating Dale's principle that can exert both excitatory and inhibitory effects. We identify parameter regimes in which this architecture exhibits transitions between synchronous and asynchronous dynamics that differ quantitatively from those observed in a matched monolingual control architecture. We report distinct information-processing signatures both at the level of neurons and higher-order interactions between them near the phase transitions. These results suggest that the population of neurons violating Dales principle may provide an alternative mechanism for regulating large-scale oscillatory activity in neural circuits.

Title: Polarization-selective quantum cooperative response in dual-species atom arrays
Authors: Huan Wang, Shangguo Zhu, Yun Long, Fei Zhang, Yinghui Guo, Mingbo Pu, Xiangang Luo
Abstract: Atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for quantum light-matter interfaces, yet single-species arrays are constrained by in-plane symmetry, restricting polarization control. Here we investigate the cooperative optical response of dual-species subwavelength atom arrays, in which intrinsic polarizability difference breaks in-plane symmetry. By engineering the lattice spacing and detunings, the arrays exhibit polarization-dependent subradiant modes, enabling complete reflection of specific polarization component. Leveraging this mechanism, we assemble array units as functional pixels and demonstrate a scalable polarization-selective quantum light modulator. Our work establishes a dynamically reconfigurable atomic-photonic platform for versatile subwavelength quantum optical elements.

Title: Analogue many-body gravitating quantum systems with a network of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Youssef Trifa, Dario Cafasso, Marco Fattori, Luca Pezzè
Abstract: Operational probes of the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity in the Newtonian regime -- via mass-energy equivalence in clocks or spatial superpositions in interferometers -- share a common description in terms of an effective qubit-qubit Ising coupling. Here we generalize both paradigms to interacting $(N+1)$-level effective qudits made of atomic ensembles with particle number, $N$. The many-body enhancement boosts the signal-to-noise and increases the effective interaction rate, facilitating the observation of gravitationally induced entanglement and decoherence, certified by metrological witnesses based on local and collective measurements. Furthermore, we show that quantum effects induced by gravitational interaction can be simulated by trapped bimodal Bose-Einstein condensates with long-range (e.g. dipolar) coupling, providing a programmable analogue platform to explore gravitating quantum dynamics at accessible time and energy scales. Finally, extending the protocol to a sensor network broadens the entanglement-detection window.

Title: Discrete turn strategies emerge in information-limited navigation
Authors: Jose M. Betancourt, Matthew P. Leighton, Thierry Emonet, Benjamin B. Machta, Michael C. Abbott
Abstract: Navigation up a sensory gradient is one of the simplest behaviours, and the simplest strategy is run and tumble. But some organisms use other strategies, such as reversing direction or turning by some angle. Here we ask what drives the choice of strategy, which we frame as maximising up-gradient speed using a given amount of sensory information per unit time. We find that, without directional information on which way to turn, behavioural strategies which make sudden turns perform better than gradual steering. We see various transitions where a different strategy becomes optimal, such as a switch from reversing direction to fully re-orienting tumbles as more information becomes available. And, among more complex re-orientation strategies, we show that discrete turn angles are best, and see transitions in how many such angles the optimal strategy employs.

Title: Spin Glass Concepts in Computer Science, Statistics, and Learning
Authors: Andrea Montanari
Abstract: Spin glass theory studies the structure of sublevel sets and minima (or near-minima) of certain classes of random functions in high dimension. Near-minima of random functions also play an important role in high-dimensional statistics and statistical learning, where minimizing the empirical risk (which is a random function of the model parameters) is the method of choice for learning a statistical model from noisy data. Finally, near-minima of random functions are obviously central to average-case analysis of optimization algorithms. Computer science, statistics, and machine learning naturally lead to questions that are traditionally not addressed within physics and mathematical physics. I will try to explain how ideas from spin glass theory have seeded recent developments in these fields. (This article was written on the occasion of the 2024 Abel Prize to Michel Talagrand.)

Abstract: We consider N interacting quantum particles on a one-dimensional lattice, and subjected to an external linear potential. For N = 1, the corresponding Hamiltonian is explicitly diagonalizable, with superexponentially localized eigenstates. This is called Stark localization. We prove that superexponential spectral localization persists for arbitrary N and every interaction strength.

Title: Algebraic-Dynamical Perturbation Theory of Large-$U$ Hubbard Models. Single Particle Spectrum of Antiferromagnetic Mott Insulating States
Authors: Wenxin Ding, Rong Yu
Abstract: In this work, we present an analytical framework for studying antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulating states in the Hubbard model. We first derive an analytical solution for the single-particle Green's functions in the atomic limit. Within a second-order perturbation approach, we compute the ground state energy and show that the ground state is antiferromagnetically ordered. Then we derive an analytical solution for single-particle Green's functions when effects of the hopping term are considered in the Néel state. With the analytical solution, we compute the spectral functions and explain various properties of the AFM Mott insulating state as observed both experimentally and numerically: i) magnetic blueshift of the Mott gap; ii) the low energy part in the parental compounds of cuprate high \(T_c\) superconductors, which corresponds to a single band Hubbard model description. This work comprehends the electronic properties of antiferromagnetic Mott states analytically and provides a foundation for future investigations of doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, aiming for the mechanism of cuprates high-\(T_c\) superconductivity.

Title: Unravelling spontaneous Bloch-type skyrmion in centrosymmetric two-dimensional magnets
Authors: Jingman Pang, Xiaohang Niu, Hong Jian Zhao, Yun Zhang, Laurent Bellaiche
Abstract: The realization of magnetic skyrmions in two-dimensional (2D) magnets holds great promise for both fundamental research and device applications. Despite recent progress, two-dimensional skyrmion hosts are still limited, due to the fact that most 2D magnets are centrosymmetric and thus lack Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). We show here, using a general analysis based on symmetry, that Bloch-type skyrmions can, in fact, be stabilized in 2D magnets, due to the interplay between in-plane component (dx) of second nearest-neighbor DMI and magnetic anisotropy. Its validity is demonstrated in the Cr2Ge2Te6 monolayer, which is also verified by recent experiments. Our work gives a clear direction for experimental studies of 2D magnetic materials to stabilize skyrmions and should greatly enrich the research on magnetic skyrmions in 2D lattices.

Title: Interaction robustness of the chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals and Luttinger liquids from a mixed anomaly approach
Authors: Shuyang Wang, Jay D. Sau
Abstract: The chiral anomaly is one of the robust quantum effects in relativistic field theories with a chiral symmetry where charges in chiral sectors appear to be separately conserved. The chiral anomaly, which is often associated with a renormalization-invariant topological term, is a violation of this conservation law due to quantum effects. Such anomalies manifest in Weyl materials as an electromagnetic field-induced transfer of charge between Fermi pockets. However, the emergent nature of the conservation of chiral charge leads to manifestations of the chiral anomaly response that depend on the details of the system such as the strength of interactions. In this paper, we apply an approach where the chiral symmetry in solid materials is replaced by the combination of charge $U(1)$ gauge and spatial translation symmetry. The chiral anomaly in this case is replaced by a mixed anomaly between the two symmetries and the chiral charge can be defined as being proportional to the total momentum. We show that the chiral anomaly associated with this chiral charge is unrenormalized by interactions in contrast to other chiral charges in $(1+1)D$ whose renormalization is regularization dependent. In $(3+1)$D Weyl systems, this chiral anomaly is equivalent to the charge transferred between Fermi surfaces which can be measured through changes in Fermi-surface-enclosed volume. We propose a pump-probe technique to measure this.

Title: Atomic-scale tunable phonon transport at tailored grain boundaries and Their Impact on Thermal Conductivity

Abstract: Grain boundaries (GBs) strongly influence thermal transport in crystalline solids by disrupting lattice periodicity and scattering phonons. Due to the atomic-level disorder and structural complexity, a fundamental understanding of how specific GB geometries regulate nanoscale phonon behavior and macroscopic thermal conductivity has remained elusive. Here, using emerging atomic-resolution vibrational spectroscopy, we directly correlate GB structure, defect-specific vibrational states, and thermal transport in bicrystal strontium titanate with controlled tilt and twist angles. The phonon characterizations and thermal conductivity data reveal two distinct regimes, where low-angle tilt GBs (2deg, 6deg, 10deg) substantially modulate phonon populations and mode frequencies, resulting in pronounced changes in thermal conductivity, whereas high-angle tilt GBs (22deg, 36deg) exhibit weak conductivity variation due to saturated structural disorder and scattering. In contrast, twist GBs introduce periodic defect motifs that only locally tailor phonon transport. Our results suggest tilt and twist angles as complementary knobs for coarse and fine control of phonon propagation and cross-GB thermal transport, providing a predictive framework for thermal engineering in materials.

Title: Light-enhanced dipolar interactions between exciton polaritons
Authors: Yasufumi Nakano, Olivier Bleu, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Jesper Levinsen, Meera M. Parish
Abstract: We consider the scenario of excitons in a semiconductor bilayer that are strongly coupled to cavity photons, leading to the formation of dipolar exciton polaritons (dipolaritons). Using a realistic pseudopotential for the dipolar interactions, we exactly determine the scattering between dipolaritons, accounting for the hybridization between interlayer and intralayer excitons. Similar to conventional non-dipolar polaritons, we find that the light-matter coupling enhances the interactions between dipolaritons by forcing excitons to scatter at energies that would otherwise be forbidden in ordinary exciton-exciton collisions. However, we show that this light enhancement is larger for long-range dipolar interactions than for short-range intralayer interactions, and is sensitive to the (non-uniform) dielectric environment of the bilayer. Crucially, we find that the largest dipolariton interactions are achieved for transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers in vacuum. Our results thus reveal the optimal dipolariton setup for realizing strong photon correlations.

Title: Composable and adaptive design of machine learning interatomic potentials guided by Fisher-information analysis
Authors: Weishi Wang, Mark K. Transtrum, Vincenzo Lordi, Vasily V. Bulatov, Amit Samanta
Abstract: An adaptive physics-inspired model design strategy for machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is proposed. This strategy relies on iterative reconfigurations of composite models from single-term models, followed by a unified training procedure. A model evaluation method based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and multiple-property error metrics is also proposed to guide the model reconfiguration and hyperparameter optimization. By combining the reconfiguration and the evaluation subroutines, we provide an adaptive MLIP design strategy that balances flexibility and extensibility. In a case study of designing models against a structurally diverse niobium dataset, we managed to obtain an optimal model configuration with 75 parameters generated by our framework that achieved a force RMSE of 0.172 eV/Å and an energy RMSE of 0.013 eV/atom.

Title: Kinetic Flat-Histogram Simulations of Non-Equilibrium Stochastic Processes with Continuous and Discontinuous Phase Transitions
Authors: L. M. C. Alencar, T. F. A. Alves, G. A. Alves, F. W. S. Lima, A. Macedo-Filho, R. S. Ferreira
Abstract: As far as we know, there is no flat-histogram algorithm to sample the stationary distribution of non-equilibrium stochastic processes. The present work addresses this gap by introducing a generalization of the Wang-Landau algorithm, applied to non-equilibrium stochastic processes with local transitions. The main idea is to sample macroscopic states using a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to generate trial moves, which are accepted or rejected with a probability that depends inversely on the stationary distribution. The stationary distribution is refined through the simulation by a modification factor, leading to convergence toward the true stationary distribution. A visitation histogram is also accumulated, and the modification factor is updated when the histogram satisfies a flatness condition. The stationary distribution is obtained in the limit where the modification factor reaches a threshold value close to unity. To test the algorithm, we compare simulation results for several stochastic processes with theoretically known behavior. In addition, results from the kinetic flat-histogram algorithm are compared with standard exact stochastic simulations. We show that the kinetic flat-histogram algorithm can be applied to phase transitions in stochastic processes with bistability, which describe a wide range of phenomena such as epidemic spreading, population growth, chemical reactions, and consensus formation. With some adaptations, the kinetic flat-histogram algorithm can also be applied to stochastic models on lattices and complex networks.

Title: Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of diffusive U(1)-invariant qubit circuits
Authors: Urban Duh, Marko Žnidarič
Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of translationally invariant magnetization-conserving qubit circuits via the spectrum of the quasi-momentum-resolved truncated propagator of extensive observables. Diffusive transport of the conserved magnetization is reflected in the Gaussian quasi-momentum $k$ dependence of the leading eigenvalue (Ruelle-Pollicott resonance) of the truncated propagator for small $k$. This, in particular, allows us to extract the diffusion constant. For large $k$, the leading Ruelle-Pollicott resonance is not related to transport and governs the exponential decay of correlation functions. Additionally, we conjecture the existence of a continuum of eigenvalues below the leading diffusive resonance, which governs non-exponential decay, for instance, power-law hydrodynamic tails. We expect our conclusions to hold for generic systems with exactly one U(1) conserved quantity.

Title: Floquet-Engineering Weyl Points and Linked Fermi Arcs from Straight Nodal Lines
Authors: Dongling Liu, Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Zhongbo Yan
Abstract: Floquet engineering provides a powerful and flexible method for modifying the band structures of quantum materials. While circularly polarized light has been shown to convert curved nodal lines in three-dimensional semimetals into Weyl points, such a transformation is forbidden for an isolated straight nodal line. In this work, we uncover a dramatic shift in this paradigm when multiple straight nodal lines intersect. We observe that circularly polarized light not only gaps them into Weyl points but also induces unprecedented surface-state Fermi arcs that extend across the entire surface Brillouin zone and form a linked topological structure. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of light-driven transitions in topological semimetals and unveil a unique Weyl semimetal phase defined by linked Fermi arcs. We discuss potential exotic phenomena arising from this phase, applications of our predictions to spin-splitting antiferromagnets, and the extension of this Weyl semimetal phase to classical systems.

Title: Light-induced odd-parity altermagnets on dimerized lattices
Authors: Dongling Liu, Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Di Zhu, Zhigang Wu, Zhongbo Yan
Abstract: Altermagnets are an emerging class of collinear magnets with momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization. These materials can be broadly classified into two categories based on the behavior of spin splitting at time-reversal-related momenta: even-parity and odd-parity altermagnets. While even-parity altermagnets have been thoroughly investigated both theoretically and experimentally, the systems capable of hosting odd-parity altermagnetism remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light dynamically converts collinear PT-symmetric antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices into odd parity p-wave altermagnets. Because of the underlying Dirac band structure of the dimerized lattice, we find that the resulting p-wave altermagnets can realize Chern insulators (2D) and Weyl semimetals (3D) under appropriate drive conditions. Our findings demonstrate that collinear antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices provide ideal platforms to investigate the dynamical generation of odd-parity altermagnetism.

Title: One-dimensional lattice random walks in a Gaussian random potential
Authors: Silvio Kalaj, Enzo Marinari, Gleb Oshanin, Luca Peliti
Abstract: We study random walks evolving in continuous time on a one-dimensional lattice where each site $x$ hosts a quenched random potential $U_x$. The potentials on different sites are independent, identically distributed Gaussian random variables. We analyze three distinct models that specify how the transition rates depend on $U_x$: the random-force-like model, random walks with randomized stepping times, and the Gaussian trap model. Our analysis focuses on five key disorder-dependent quantities defined for a finite chain with $N$ sites: the probability current, its reciprocal (the resistance), the splitting probability $E_-$, the mean first-passage time $T_N$, and the diffusion coefficient $D_N$ in a periodic chain. By determining the moments of these random variables, we demonstrate that the probability current and resistance are not self-averaging, which leads to pronounced differences between their average and typical behaviors. In contrast, $E_-$, $T_N$ and $D_N$ become self-averaging when $N \to \infty$, though they exhibit strong sample-to-sample fluctuations for finite $N$.

Title: Extrapolation of Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials for Organic and Polymeric Systems
Authors: Natalie E. Hooven, Arthur Y. Lin, Charles H. Carroll, Rose K. Cersonsky
Abstract: Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) have surged in popularity due to their promise of expanding the spatiotemporal scales possible for simulating molecules with high fidelity. The accuracy of any MLIP is dependent on the data used for its training; thus, for large molecules, like polymers, where accurate training data is prohibitively difficult to obtain, it becomes necessary to pursue non-traditional methods to construct MLIPs, many of which are based on constructing MLIPs using smaller, analogous chemical systems. However, we have yet to understand the limits to which smaller molecules can be used as a proxy for extrapolating macromolecular energetics. Here, we provide a ``control study'' for such experiments, exploring the ability of MLIP approaches to extrapolate between n=1-8 n-polyalkanes at identical conditions. Through Principal Covariates Classification, we quantitatively demonstrate how convergence in chemical environments between training and testing datasets coincides with an MLIP's transferability. Additionally, we show how careful attention to the construction of an MLIP's neighbor list can promote greater transferability when considering various levels of the energetic hierarchy. Our results establish a roadmap for how one can create transferable MLIPs for macromolecular systems without the prohibitive cost of constructing system-specific training data.

Title: Giant and robust Josephson diode effect in multiband topological nanowires
Authors: Bao-Zong Wang, Zi-Kai Li, Zhong-Da Li, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: We theoretically predict the giant and robust Josephson diode effect in quasi-one-dimensional topological Majorana nanowires in the regime with multiple subbands, which is expected to be relevant for the real experiment. In the multiband regime, the Majorana bound states and conventional Andreev bound states can naturally coexist, and respectively contribute to the fractional and conventional parts in the Josephson effect, with the former/latter having 4$\pi$/2$\pi$-periodicity. We show that the interplay between the two types of bound modes can produce a robust and giant diode effect in the deep topological phase regime. Notably, we unveil a novel spin parity exchange mechanism, occurring only in the multiband regime, which leads to a robust high efficiency plateau of the giant diode effect. This effect is a nontrivial consequence of the balanced Fermi moment shifts of the multiple subbands in tuning the external magnetic field. Our finding highlights the subband engineering as a powerful tool to optimize the Josephson diode effect realistically and provides a new feasible signature to identify topological phase regime in superconducting nanowires.

Title: Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum transition in 2 dimensions
Authors: M. C. Diamantini, C. A. Trugenberger, V. M. Vinokur
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is the prototype of a phase transition driven by the formation and interaction of topological defects in two-dimensional (2D) systems. In typical models these are vortices: above a transition temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$ vortices are free, below this transition temperature they get confined. In this work we extend the concept of BKT transition to quantum systems in two dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate that a zero-temperature quantum BKT phase transition, driven by a coupling constant can occur in 2D models governed by an effective gauge field theory with a diverging dielectric constant. One particular example is that of a compact U(1) gauge theory with a diverging dielectric constant, where the quantum BKT transition is induced by non-relativistic, purely 2D magnetic monopoles, which can be viewed also as electric vortices. These quantum BKT transitions have the same diverging exponent $z$ as the quantum Griffiths transition but have nothing to do with disorder.

Title: Microwave surface resistance of Tl-1223 films in a dc magnetic field
Authors: Alessandro Magalotti, Andrea Alimenti, Emilio Bellingeri, Cristina Bernini, Sergio Calatroni, Alessandro Leveratto, Enrico Silva, Kostiantyn Torokhtii, Ruggero Vaglio, Pablo Vidal García, Nicola Pompeo
Abstract: We present first preliminary surface impedance measurements on Tl-1223 films in dc magnetic fields, in view of potential applications for the next generation Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh) at CERN. The Tl-1223 samples were produced through laser ablation, with nominal thickness of 1 {\mu}m and grown on a thick LaAl2O3 substrate. The presence of Tl-1212 phase identified by XRD and BSE microscopy, could be avoided by changing the oxygen partial pressure during heat treatment. The high-frequency transport properties of the samples were characterized using microwave resonant devices, at fixed frequencies of 14.9 GHz, 24.2 GHz and 26.7 GHz, in the temperature range 40 K to 140 K. An external applied static magnetic field up to 12 T was applied. Samples from subsequent batches exhibited huge improvements in the microwave properties, confirming the progress in the deposition technique.

Title: Photoinduced melting dynamics and collective mode in a correlated charge-ordered system
Authors: Yasuhiro Tanaka, Hitoshi Seo
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the transient spectral function during the photoinduced melting of charge order in a correlated electron system, to unravel the dynamical processes triggered by different initial excitations. We employ a one-dimensional interacting spinless fermion model introducing a pulsed laser light, and perform a comparative study by the Hartree-Fock approximation and by the exact diagonalization method to numerically solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. We find characteristic behavior in the transient spectral function, whose features strongly depend on the pump light frequency $\omega_p$. When $\omega_p$ is resonant with the collective phase mode of frequency $\Omega_c\simeq \Delta_{\rm CO}/2$, where $\Delta_{\rm CO}$ is the charge gap, the transient spectral function exhibits a photoinduced in-gap weight which triggers large responses. With increasing the laser intensity, the development of in-gap weight directly turns into the collapse of the gap. This charge-order destabilization process is in sharp contrast to the case of $\omega_p>\Delta_{\rm CO}$, where the photoirradiation induces interband electron-hole excitations giving rise to a shrinkage of the gap. The impact of quantum fluctuations and spatial inhomogeneity on the photoinduced dynamics is also discussed.

Title: Generating ferro-spinetic polarizations in altermagnetic insulators
Authors: Toshihiro Sato, Mengli Hu, Ion Cosma Fulga, Oleg Janson, Jorge I. Facio, Alessandro Stroppa, Fakher F. Assaad, Jeroen van den Brink
Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel class of fully spin-compensated magnetic materials that nevertheless have spin-split electronic bands, offering novel perspectives for spintronics applications. Based on a rigorous analysis of altermagnetic many-body models and their symmetry we establish the important role of two fundamental types of polarizations in altermagnetic insulators: the charge and the spinetic one, where the latter corresponds to a macroscopic spin-displacement field. First principles calculations confirm and quantify their presence in real materials. The two polarizations are directly coupled and emerge in orthogonal directions when inversion symmetry is broken, either by the system developing a spontaneously ferroelectric polarization (in ferroelectric altermagnets), or by a charge displacement induced by an external electric field (for inversion invariant altermagnetic insulators). This presence of large and switchable spin accumulations constitute an attractive fundamental feature of altermagnetic insulators.

Title: TXL Fusion: A Hybrid Machine Learning Framework Integrating Chemical Heuristics and Large Language Models for Topological Materials Discovery
Authors: Arif Ullah, Rajibul Islam, Ghulam Hussain, Zahir Muhammad, Xiaoguang Li, Ming Yang
Abstract: Topological materials--including insulators (TIs) and semimetals (TSMs)--hold immense promise for quantum technologies, yet their discovery remains constrained by the high computational cost of first-principles calculations and the slow, resource-intensive nature of experimental synthesis. Here, we introduce TXL Fusion, a hybrid machine learning framework that integrates chemical heuristics, engineered physical descriptors, and large language model (LLM) embeddings to accelerate the discovery of topological materials. By incorporating features such as space group symmetry, valence electron configurations, and composition-derived metrics, TXL Fusion classifies materials across trivial, TSM, and TI categories with improved accuracy and generalization compared to conventional approaches. The framework successfully identified new candidates, with representative cases further validated through density functional theory (DFT), confirming its predictive robustness. By uniting data-driven learning with chemical intuition, TXL Fusion enables rapid and interpretable exploration of complex materials spaces, establishing a scalable paradigm for the intelligent discovery of next-generation topological and quantum materials.

Title: From percolation transition to Anderson localization in one-dimensional speckle potentials
Authors: Margaux Vrech, Jan Major, Dominique Delande, Marcel Filoche, Nicolas Cherroret
Abstract: Classical particles in random potentials typically experience a percolation phase transition, being trapped in clusters of mean size $\chi$ that diverges algebraically at a percolation threshold. In contrast, quantum transport in random potentials is controlled by the Anderson localization length, which shows no distinct feature at this classical critical point. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the semi-classical crossover between these two regimes by studying particle propagation in a one-dimensional, red speckle potential, which hosts a percolation transition at its upper bound. As the system deviates from the classical limit, we find that the algebraic divergence of $\chi$ continuously connects to a smooth yet non-analytic increase of the localization length. We characterize this behavior both numerically and theoretically using a semi-classical approach. In this crossover regime, the correlated and non-Gaussian nature of the speckle potential becomes essential, causing the standard Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DPMK) description for uncorrelated disorder to break down. Instead, we predict the emergence of a bimodal transmission distribution, a behavior normally absent in one dimension, which we capture within our semi-classical analysis. Deep in the quantum regime, the DMPK framework is recovered and the universal features of Anderson localization reappear.

Title: The crossover from classical to quantum transport in a weakly-interacting Fermi gas
Authors: Hadrien Kurkjian
Abstract: We present an exact solution of the quantum kinetic equation of a weakly interacting Fermi gas in the crossover from the degenerate Fermi-liquid regime to the classical Boltzmann gas. We construct families of orthogonal polynomials tailored to each angular momentum channel, enabling a fast and systematically improvable decomposition of the phase-space distribution. This approach yields accurate, non-variational predictions for the shear viscosity, thermal diffusivity, and spin diffusivity to leading order in the scattering length. We demonstrate that the commonly used relaxation-time approximation fails dramatically at low temperature--by up to 25%. Our method provides a numerically efficient framework for benchmarking transport in strongly correlated regimes and for simulating the kinetics of quantum gases beyond hydrodynamics.

Title: Interface Spin-orbit Coupling Induced Room-temperature Ferromagnetic Insulator
Authors: Yuhao Hong, Shilin Hu, Ziyue Shen, Chao Deng, Xiaodong Zhang, Lei Wang, Long Wei, Qinghua Zhang, Lingfei Wang, Liang Si, Yulin Gan, Kai Chen, Zhaoliang Liao
Abstract: Fabricating room-temperature ferromagnetic insulators, which are crucial candidates for next-generation dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices, remains a significant challenge. In this Letter, we report on the epitaxial synthesis of novel room-temperature ferromagnetic insulating thin films created through the precise construction of (111)-oriented 3d/5d interfaces. Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling. This enhanced interfacial spin-orbit coupling strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path. As a result, the intrinsic metallicity of LSMO is suppressed, giving rise to a new ferromagnetic insulating phase that emerges between the ferromagnetic metal and paramagnetic insulator regimes of the LSMO phase diagram. Furthermore, the temperature window of the ferromagnetic insulating phase can be tuned by precisely controlling the thickness of the LSMO layers. Our Letter reveals a new strategy for developing ferromagnetic insulators by engineering 3d/5d interfaces and orientations, paving a way for the development of novel dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices.

Title: Highly controllable switching pathways in multiferroic GdMn$_2$O$_5$
Authors: M. Ryzhkov, A. Granero, J. Wettstein, Anna Pimenov, X. Wang, L. Ponet, S.-W. Cheong, M. Mostovoy, Andrei Pimenov, S. Artyukhin
Abstract: Controlling magnetic moments using electric fields remains a central challenge in spintronics. Multiferroics, where magnetic and electric orders coexist, may be a natural platform for such control, but progress has been limited because interactions between these orders are typically too weak to overcome the energy barriers between magnetic states. A recently demonstrated topologically protected switching circumvents this limitation by exploiting reduced barriers at a phase transition. Nevertheless, the conditions enabling this phenomenon remain elusive and electric field control is poorly understood. Here, we experimentally map the energy landscape by tracking transitions in GdMn$_2$O$_5$ under combined electric and magnetic fields. The experiments reveal that the switching pathways can be controlled by the electric field. A minimal theoretical model captures the observed behavior, identifies the parameter space where switching paths are sensitive to small perturbations and reveals design principles for implementing topological switching in other materials.

Title: Stress-Induced Ferroelectricity in Hafnium Oxide Core-Shell Nanoparticles
Authors: Anna N. Morozovska, Eugene A. Eliseev, Richard (Yu)Liu, Sergei V. Kalinin, Dean R. Evans
Abstract: In contrast to hafnia (HfO2) thin films, where the appearance of switchable ferroelectric polarization can be induced by strain or defect engineering, reliable methods for controlling ferroelectricity are absent in HfO2 nanoparticles. Direct experimental observations of ferroelectric hysteresis and ferroelectric domains in these nanoparticles are also absent. To the best of our knowledge, stress-induced ferroelectric states in the HfO2 nanoparticles have not been explored. In this work, we study the influence of chemical stress on phase diagrams, dielectric and polar properties of spherical HfO2 core-shell nanoparticles using a Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional that includes trilinear and biquadratic couplings involving polar, antipolar, and nonpolar order parameters. The ferroelectric phase exhibits reentrant behavior as a function of nanoparticle size, such that the spontaneous polarization exists only within a limited range of core radii R_c, namely R_cr^min<R_c<R_cr^max. The minimal critical radius R_cr^min is primarily determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects; the maximal critical radius R_cr^max is primarily determined by the size dependence of chemical stresses induced by the elastic defects in the shell. Thus, this work identifies a stress-driven mechanism for reentrant ferroelectricity stabilization in nanoscale HfO2 systems, arising from the competition between depolarization field-induced suppression of ferroelectricity and its stabilization by shell-induced chemical stress. We revealed that relatively large compressive chemical strains are necessary to induce the ferroelectric phase in the HfO2 nanoparticles. Successful chemical strain engineering opens the way for significant enhancement of nanoscale HfO2 polar properties for applications in advanced memory cells and logic devices.

Title: Quantum critical behavior of cuprate superconductors observed by inelastic X-ray scattering
Authors: H. Y. Huang, C. Y. Mou, A. Singh, J. S. Su, J. Okamoto, S. Komiya, C. T. Chen, T. K. Lee, A. Fujimori, D. J. Huang
Abstract: Progress toward a complete understanding of cuprate superconductors has been hindered by their intricate phase diagram, potentially linked to a quantum critical point (QCP). However, conclusive evidence for the QCP is lacking, as the presumed QCP is buried under the superconducting dome, disguising its presence. Here, we use high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to examine the dynamical charge-charge correlation in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and uncover the quantum critical scaling, a key feature required for a QCP. Specifically, \djh{we observed that the inverse correlation lengths for various dopings and temperatures collapsed onto a universal scaling curve, yielding a critical exponent $\nu$ of $0.74 \pm 0.08$. The non-negativity of this exponent confirms the presence of a QCP. Remarkably, the value of $\nu$ suggests that while the QCP is manifested through the charge-density wave, other orders also participate, such that the QCP appears to belong to the universality class characterized by the O(4) symmetry, reminiscent of the microscopic SO(4) symmetry in the Hubbard model at half-filling. Further analysis indicates that the QCP is highly dissipative with a short quasi-particle lifetime, reflecting the intertwined quantum fluctuations due to its being buried inside the superconducting state.

Title: Quantization Mapping on Dirac Dynamics via Voltage-Driven Charge Density in Monolayer Graphene: A Klein Paradox and Entropy-Ruled Wavevector Mechanics Study
Authors: Karuppuchamy Navamani
Abstract: Thermodynamics coupled with quantum features on electron and hole dynamics in Dirac materials is quite interesting and crucial for real device applications. The correlation between the formation of electron-hole puddles in nearer to the charge neutrality point (CNP), and the role of disorder is fundamentally important for Dirac transport in graphene systems. Numerous studies on graphene further urge the necessity to find a better descriptor for disorder-charge puddles relation, which directly influences electrical conductivity. In principle, the external bias-driven energy level shift and its relevant density of states (DOS) provide information about the effect of total interactive potential on linear energy dispersion in terms of wavevector, but yet to be well-explored. With this ground, here we map the energy quantization for Dirac materials through the empirical relation of voltage-driven charge density in monolayer graphene, using the differential entropy (h)-ruled wavevector (k) mechanics. For this work, we propose the four postulates which are the key observable descriptions of earlier research reports, to study the precise electronic transport via an entropy-guided wavevector propagation approach, along with the Klein paradox, which pertains to the ultrafast dynamics in the Dirac or quasi-Dirac systems. The introduced h-ruled k and h-ruled N relations generalize the electron dynamics in both the unbounded and potentially bounded Dirac systems. Through the quantization mapping procedure under different voltage-driven potential (U=eV) boundary conditions, the observed energy shift from lower to excited quantum state obeys the relation of N(k)=N(U)^3; here, N(U) is the voltage-driven potential energy contribution factor for the quantum state existence. This study reveals information about the interaction potential-DOS relationship in the Dirac materials.

Title: Mesoscopic MCT theory resolves Giant Non-Gaussian Parameter and Flory's conjecture
Authors: Yikun Ren, Feixiang Xu, Ming Lin
Abstract: Extending Prigogine's ideas to the interior of the system, we generalize mode-coupling theory from a microscopic to a mesoscopic formulation by incorporating the non-equilibrium eigen-phase. The resulting framework resolves two long-standing puzzles in glass transition physics with an error less than 0.01 against experiments: (i) the giant non-Gaussian parameter $\alpha_{2} \sim 1-10$ which exceeds standard MCT predictions (only 0.1) by two orders of magnitude; (ii) the universal WLF constant $C_{1}=17 \ln 10 /(3 \sqrt{42}-19) \approx 16.7$, empirically observed for seven decades but never derived from first principles(e.g. Adam-Gibbs $C_{1}=8.5$, while other theories are off by more than a factor of two). These results establish mesoscopic MCT as a measurable foundation for non-equilibrium thermodynamics, unifying dynamic heterogeneity and thermodynamic universality in glass-forming systems.

Title: Quadrupole formation and coupling to magnetic and structural degrees of freedom in the $5d^1$ double perovskites Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$
Authors: Francesco Martinelli, Claude Ederer
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between charge, magnetic, and structural degrees of freedom in the isostructural and isoelectronic $5d^1$ double-perovskites Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$. Using first-principles-based electronic structure calculations, we show that both materials exhibit a tendency toward spontaneous quadrupolar order in the cubic paramagnetic phase, which is slightly weaker in Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ than in Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$. Our analysis further reveals an intimate coupling between the local magnetic moments and charge quadrupoles, mediated by the strong spin-orbit interaction, that leads to the unusual canted configuration of magnetic moments observed in these systems. When structural degrees of freedom are included, the two materials exhibit pronounced differences. In Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ the strong coupling to Jahn-Teller distortions stabilizes the antiferroic $\mathcal{Q}_{x^2-y^2}$ order, yielding excellent agreement with available experimental data. In contrast, the Jahn-Teller coupling is significantly weaker in Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ and appears insufficient to stabilize the antiferroic quadrupolar order. While this is consistent with the absence of any measurable long-range structural distortion above the magnetic transition temperature, it contrasts with experimental results indicating a strong canting of the magnetic moments. Our analysis thus successfully describes the mechanisms shaping the properties of the Re-compound while a full quantitative description of the magnetic ground state of Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ is still elusive.

Title: peapods: A Rust-Accelerated Monte Carlo Package for Ising Spin Systems
Authors: Yan Ru Pei
Abstract: We present peapods (this http URL), an open-source Python package for Monte Carlo simulation of Ising spin systems with arbitrary coupling constants on periodic Bravais lattices with user-specified neighbor offsets. The computational core is written in Rust and exposed to Python via PyO3, combining the ergonomic interface of Python with the performance of compiled, memory-safe code. The package implements Metropolis and Gibbs single-spin-flip algorithms, Swendsen-Wang and Wolff cluster updates, parallel tempering, and three replica cluster moves for spin glasses: the Houdayer isoenergetic cluster move, the Jorg stochastic variant, and the Chayes-Machta-Redner (CMR) blue-bond algorithm. Overlap statistics between replica pairs enable computation of the spin glass order parameter and Binder ratio. Replica-level parallelism is achieved through the Rayon work-stealing scheduler. We validate the implementation against the exact critical temperatures of the two-dimensional Ising model on the square and triangular lattices via finite-size scaling of the Binder cumulant.

Title: Superconductivity and magnetism in bilayer nickelates: itinerant perspective
Authors: Yi-Ming Wu, Tobias Helbig, Salahudin V. Smailagić, Hao-Xin Wang, Yijun Yu, Harold Y. Hwang, Srinivas Raghu
Abstract: We study superconductivity and magnetism in bilayer nickelates from an itinerant perspective. Starting from a tight binding fit to recent ARPES measurements on compressively strained thin films, we incorporate the standard set of onsite repulsive interactions among partially filled $e_g$ orbitals: intra-orbital $U$, inter-orbital $U'$, Hund's coupling $J_H$ and a pair hopping $J_P$. We obtain the effective pairing interaction by dressing these bare interactions with particle-hole fluctuations via the RPA. In the strong Hund's coupling regime, we find that $s$-wave superconductivity and $(\pi/2, \pi/2)$ SDW order are the favored ground states. With weaker Hund's coupling, we find that $d$-wave pairing and $(\pi, \pi)$ SDW are the leading ground states. Our results are qualitatively consistent with earlier DMRG studies, and point to the key role played by Hund's coupling in determining the nature of superconductivity and magnetism in this system.

Title: On the electrical double layer capacitance of the restricted primitive model: a link between the mesoscopic theory and the associative mean spherical approximation
Authors: O. Patsahan
Abstract: The results for the electrical double layer capacitance and the charge density of ``free ions'' obtained from the mesoscopic theory are compared with the corresponding results of the associative mean spherical approximation. While the first theory takes into account the fluctuations of the charge density, the second theory assumes that the free ions and ion pairs are in chemical equilibrium according to the mass action law. Our results demonstrate a fairly good agreement between the two theories at high densities and low temperatures.

Title: Crystallography-driven molecularization of a two-dimensional spin-$3/2$ magnet
Authors: Hari Borutta, Tobias Müller, Ronny Thomale, Harald O. Jeschke, Yasir Iqbal
Abstract: Large-spin two-dimensional magnets are generally expected to develop conventional long-range order once the dominant exchange scale becomes appreciable. The layered spin-$3/2$ maple-leaf compound Na$_2$Mn$_3$O$_7$ defies this expectation: despite sizable antiferromagnetic interactions and no evident disorder, it exhibits no magnetic ordering and displays two well-separated thermodynamic crossover scales. We show that this behavior originates from a crystallography-driven molecularization of the magnetic degrees of freedom. The low-symmetry structure partitions the Mn sublattice into inequivalent exchange pathways, generating a pronounced hierarchy that nearly isolates antiferromagnetic hexagons. Magnetic correlations therefore develop in two stages: first within individual hexagons at a scale set by the dominant exchange, and only at much lower temperatures do frustrated inter-hexagon couplings attempt to establish coherence across the lattice. While isolated hexagons reproduce the two-step thermodynamic structure, the experimentally relevant temperature scales emerge only once the hexagons are embedded in the frustrated two-dimensional network. The resulting quantum ground state is magnetically disordered, characterized by strong intra-hexagon correlations and rapidly decaying inter-hexagon correlations. These results identify crystallographic inequivalence as a materials-level mechanism for stabilizing molecularized and quantum-disordered states even in large-spin two-dimensional magnets.

Title: Discovering new photovoltaics using optimal transport theory
Authors: Matthew A. H. Walker, Zibo Zhou, Junayd Ul Islam, Keith T. Butler
Abstract: Searching by chemical and structural analogy is one of the most commonly used and successful approaches to materials discovery. However, formulating this task for algorithmic implementation raises the question of how we define similar materials. Methods have been proposed for searching materials space using vectors based on chemical composition and functional fragments in the material. Descriptors for structural similarity have also been proposed. However, the question of how to incorporate and balance structural and compositional similarity measures in a single metric remains open. Here, we adapt methods developed for calculating distances between undirected graphs and apply them to crystalline materials similarity. The Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) metric uses optimal transport theory to map between two graphs considering a balance of the graph structure and the information present at the nodes of the graph (atoms in crystals). We apply the method to exploring new photovoltaic materials. We demonstrate that FGW is competitive with embeddings from an equivariant graph neural network, trained on $> 10^6$ materials, despite minimal training. We then apply FGW to a discovery campaign to identify materials from the Materials Project database that have not previously been explored as photovoltaics, but have similarities to known high-efficiency materials. After validating predictions with hybrid density functional theory, we identify seven previously unexplored high-efficiency photovoltaic absorber candidates, including Cs$_5$Sb$_8$, which is found to have a predicted SLME of $> 30\%$ and to be thermodynamically stable. The FGW approach demonstrates the power of strong inductive biases for developing metrics for materials exploration with minimal training data.

Title: Minimal Time Robust Control for Two Superconducting Qubits
Authors: Niril George, Joseph L. Allen, Robert Kosut, Eran Ginossar
Abstract: High-fidelity quantum gates are crucial for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing; however, decoherence significantly reduces gate fidelities during long operation times. Although optimal control techniques can theoretically minimize these operation times, they often neglect realistic uncertainties in system parameters. In this work, we demonstrate that by using robust optimal control strategies, the cross-resonance gate in superconducting systems can be operated within 64 ns, achieving fidelities of F > 0.99 while maintaining robustness against up to 10% uncertainty in a single parameter. Alternatively, by extending the control time to 71 ns, we achieve fidelities of F > 0.999 with robustness against up to 3% uncertainty. Our results identify the minimal control times attainable with experimentally feasible pulses and system parameters, as well as the maximum allowable static parameter error for high-fidelity operations. Furthermore, we demonstrate simultaneous robustness against both static and time-dependent errors by generating 100 ns control pulses (F > 0.99) that maintain robustness against 10% static parameter error and time-dependent parameter fluctuations two orders of magnitude stronger than typical experimental noise. These findings demonstrate a viable open-loop strategy for implementing fast, high-fidelity quantum gates in the presence of realistic system uncertainties that would otherwise degrade conventional control pulses.

Title: Mixed-state Quantum Phases: Renormalization and Quantum Error Correction
Authors: Shengqi Sang, Yijian Zou, Timothy H. Hsieh
Abstract: Open system quantum dynamics can generate a variety of long-range entangled mixed states, yet it has been unclear in what sense they constitute phases of matter. To establish that two mixed states are in the same phase, as defined by their two-way connectivity via local quantum channels, we use the renormalization group (RG) and decoders of quantum error correcting codes. We introduce a real-space RG scheme for mixed states based on local channels which ideally preserve correlations with the complementary system, and we prove this is equivalent to the reversibility of the channel's action. As an application, we demonstrate an exact RG flow of finite temperature toric code in two dimensions to infinite temperature, thus proving it is in the trivial phase. In contrast, for toric code subject to local dephasing, we establish a mixed state toric code phase using local channels obtained by truncating an RG-type decoder and the minimum weight perfect matching decoder. We also discover a precise relation between mixed state phase and decodability, by proving that local noise acting on toric code cannot destroy logical information without bringing the state out of the toric code phase.

Title: Global graph features unveiled by unsupervised geometric deep learning
Authors: Mirja Granfors, Jesús Pineda, Blanca Zufiria Gerbolés, Joana B. Pereira, Carlo Manzo, Giovanni Volpe
Abstract: Graphs provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems, but their structural variability poses significant challenges for analysis and classification. To address these challenges, we introduce GAUDI (Graph Autoencoder Uncovering Descriptive Information), a novel unsupervised geometric deep learning framework designed to capture both local details and global structure. GAUDI employs an innovative hourglass architecture with hierarchical pooling and upsampling layers linked through skip connections, which preserve essential connectivity information throughout the encoding-decoding process. Even though identical or highly similar underlying parameters describing a system's state can lead to significant variability in graph realizations, GAUDI consistently maps them into nearby regions of a structured and continuous latent space, effectively disentangling invariant process-level features from stochastic noise. We demonstrate GAUDI's versatility across multiple applications, including small-world networks modeling, characterization of protein assemblies from super-resolution microscopy, analysis of collective motion in the Vicsek model, and identification of age-related changes in brain connectivity. Comparison with related approaches highlights GAUDI's superior performance in analyzing complex graphs, providing new insights into emergent phenomena across diverse scientific domains.

Title: Flow birefringence measurement in a radial Hele-Shaw cell considering three-dimensional effects
Authors: Misa Kawaguchi, William Kai Alexander Worby, Yuto Yokoyama, Ryuta X. Suzuki, Yuichiro Nagatsu, Yoshiyuki Tagawa
Abstract: Flow birefringence measurement is an emerging technique for visualizing stress fields in fluid flows. This study investigates flow birefringence in the steady radial Hele-Shaw flow. In the radial Hele-Shaw flow, stress is dominant along the gap direction, challenging the applicability of the conventional stress-optic law (SOL) with measurement from the gap direction. To overcome this problem, we used two types of flow birefringence measurement using radial Hele-Shaw cell and rheometer. We conduct flow birefringence measurements at various flow rates and compare the results with theoretical predictions. The observed phase retardation cannot be quantitatively explained using the conventional SOL, but is successfully described using the second-order SOL, which accounts for stress along the optical direction. The stress-optic coefficient in the second-order SOL was obtained by rheo-optical measurements. This study demonstrates that the combination of the second-order SOL and rheo-optical measurements is essential for an accurate interpretation of flow birefringence in Hele-Shaw flow, providing a noninvasive approach for stress field analysis in high-aspect-ratio geometries.

Title: Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal
Authors: Samuel D. Tomlinson, Aliki M. Tsopelakou, Tzia M. Onn, Steven R. H. Barrett, Adam M. Boies, Shaun D. Fitzgerald
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, the global potential of surface-based removal techniques has not yet been quantified based on limits of pollutant transport and removal rates. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for global-scale deployment across a variety of configurations, including air interaction with the built environment, mechanical ventilation and convection systems, and over the global transportation fleet Cities provide the highest removal potential, with median annual estimates of 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ and 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$ transported to their total surface area. Cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters have the potential to exceed 1 GtCO$_2$/yr (1 GtCO$_2$e/yr for CH$_4$, 20-year GWP) of removal when literature-based CO$_2$-sorbent (CH$_4$-catalyst) efficiencies are applied across their total surface area. These values represent theoretical upper bounds and are intended for comparison across applications rather than application-specific deployment. HVAC filters have the potential to achieve materials costs as low as \$600 per tCO$_2$ removed (\$2000 per tCO$_2$e) when CO$_2$-sorption (CH$_4$-catalyst) technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets and maintained through routine filter replacement, compared with \$3000 per tCO$_2$ (\$10000 per tCO$_2$e) for city surfaces, based on the literature values for these technologies' materials costs. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a pathway to advance climate and health objectives, though further studies are needed to assess their feasibility in application, and application-implementation rates and cost.

Title: Time-bin encoded quantum key distribution over 120 km with a telecom quantum dot source

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology

Title: Breaking conservation law enables steady-state entanglement out of equilibrium
Authors: Vince Hou, Eric Kleinherbers, Shane P. Kelly, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak
Abstract: We show how entangled steady states can be prepared by purely dissipative dynamics in a system coupled to a thermal environment. While entanglement is hindered by thermalization when the system and environment exchange a conserved quantity, we demonstrate that breaking this conservation law through the system-environment interaction drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady state. Such an interaction will generate multiple competing equilibration channels, effectively mimicking baths at distinct chemical potentials. When the environment also supports long-range correlations, these channels mediate nonlocal dissipation capable of generating entanglement. We illustrate the scheme in a model of two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers weakly coupled to a spin-pumped magnet, where tuneable magnon excitations enable steady-state entanglement over finite distances. Our results identifies a general mechanism for dissipative entanglement generation, rooted in the conservation structure and environmental correlations rather than fine-tuned coherent control or active driving.

Title: Free and Interacting Fermionic Conformal Field Theories on the Fuzzy Sphere
Authors: Zheng Zhou, Davide Gaiotto, Yin-Chen He
Abstract: The fuzzy-sphere regularisation is a powerful tool to study conformal field theories (CFT) in three spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we extend its scope to CFTs with local fermionic operators. We realise the free-Majorana-fermion CFT on a set-up with one flavour of bosons and one flavour of fermions on the lowest Landau level with a $1/2$ angular momentum mismatch and allow conversion between two bosons and two fermions, and use a relative chemical potential as the tuning parameter. On the phase diagram, we observe two continuous transitions described respectively by a free Majorana fermion and a gauged Ising CFT. We numerically confirm the emergent conformal symmetry through the operator spectrum and the two-point correlation function of the local Majorana fermion. We further establish a correspondence between the fuzzy-sphere models and the field-theory Lagrangians, and extend it to an interacting fermionic CFT -- the super-Ising theory with emergent super-conformal symmetry.

Title: Statistical Advantage of Softmax Attention: Insights from Single-Location Regression
Authors: O. Duranthon, P. Marion, C. Boyer, B. Loureiro, L. Zdeborová
Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation. Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear) remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with optimization by gradient-based algorithms.

Title: Quantum Complexity in Rule-Based Constrained Many-Body Models: Scars, Fragmentation, and Chaos
Authors: Arkaprava Sil, Sudipto Singha Roy
Abstract: Kinetic constraints in quantum many-body systems strongly restrict the accessible Hilbert space, giving rise to highly nontrivial dynamical behavior. In recent years, such systems have attracted growing interest as they provide insight into mechanisms of thermalization and into regimes where thermalization fails. In this work, we study a family of rule-based kinetically constrained models, including the celebrated Quantum Game of Life, from the perspective of quantum complexity, with a focus on entanglement, nonstabilizerness, and quantum chaos. Using spectral diagnostics such as level statistics and spectral form factors, we show that these models exhibit robust chaotic behavior while simultaneously supporting both strong and weak Hilbert-space fragmentation and quantum many-body scar states. To further elucidate the structure of these fragmented subspaces, we characterize them through their ability to generate quantum resources. In particular, we show that resource-generation capacity does not necessarily correlate with the dimensionality of a fragmented sector, and that entanglement structure and the ability to generate nonstabilizerness provide effective diagnostics for distinguishing dynamically disconnected sectors. Our work therefore explores kinetically constrained models in a general framework that is not restricted to Rydberg blockade-based constraints alone.

Title: Symmetry in language statistics shapes the geometry of model representations
Authors: Dhruva Karkada, Daniel J. Korchinski, Andres Nava, Matthieu Wyart, Yasaman Bahri
Abstract: The internal representations learned by language models consistently exhibit striking geometric structure: calendar months organize into a circle, historical years form a smooth one-dimensional manifold, and cities' latitudes and longitudes can be decoded using a linear probe. To explain this neural code, we first show that language statistics exhibit translation symmetry (for example, the frequency with which any two months co-occur in text depends only on the time interval between them). We prove that this symmetry governs these geometric structures in high-dimensional word embedding models, and we analytically derive the manifold geometry of word representations. These predictions empirically match large text embedding models and large language models. Moreover, the representational geometry persists at moderate embedding dimension even when the relevant statistics are perturbed (e.g., by removing all sentences in which two months co-occur). We prove that this robustness emerges naturally when the co-occurrence statistics are controlled by an underlying latent variable. These results suggest that representational manifolds have a universal origin: symmetry in the statistics of natural data.
