Title: Spherical Balls Settling Through a Quiescent Cement Paste Measured by X-ray Tomography: Influence of the Paste Thixotropy
Authors: Subhransu Dhar, Eduardo Machado-Charry, Robert Schennach, Teresa Liberto, Agathe Robisson
Abstract: The settling of spherical balls in quiescent cement pastes of increasing age is studied. Metallic spheres with radii of 2, 2.5 and 3mm are dropped into the paste and allowed to settle, while their position is tracked using X-ray tomography. The instantaneous velocity of the spheres, calculated from their movement, is observed to be quasi-constant during their fall, and an average is estimated. The results show that the average velocity of the balls decreases logarithmically with paste age until ball stoppage, for all three ball sizes. In parallel, the rheological properties of the cement paste are measured using a rheometer with a vane geometry. The evolution of the paste static yield stress over time is evaluated, and proves to be a reliable predictor for ball stoppage. Finally, thixotropic models of increasing complexity are evaluated. These models consider four forms of structural growth and breakdown parameters, and their ability to capture the ball settling velocity as a function of paste age is compared. This emphasizes the importance of considering paste breakdown in relation to shearing of the paste when the ball passes through it.

Title: Autonomous Multi-Agent AI for High-Throughput Polymer Informatics: From Property Prediction to Generative Design Across Synthetic and Bio-Polymers
Authors: Mahule Roy, Adib Bazgir, Arthur da Silva Sousa Santos, Yuwen Zhang
Abstract: We present an integrated multiagent AI ecosystem for polymer discovery that unifies high-throughput materials workflows, artificial intelligence, and computational modeling within a single Polymer Research Lifecycle (PRL) pipeline. The system orchestrates specialized agents powered by state-of-the-art large language models (DeepSeek-V2 and DeepSeek-Coder) to retrieve and reason over scientific resources, invoke external tools, execute domain-specific code, and perform metacognitive self-assessment for robust end-to-end task execution. We demonstrate three practical capabilities: a high-fidelity polymer property prediction and generative design pipeline, a fully automated multimodal workflow for biopolymer structure characterization, and a metacognitive agent framework that can monitor performance and improve execution strategies over time. On a held-out test set of 1,251 polymers, our PolyGNN agent achieves strong predictive accuracy, reaching R2 = 0.89 for glass-transition temperature (Tg ), R2 = 0.82 for tensile strength, R2 = 0.75 for elongation, and R2 = 0.91 for density. The framework also provides uncertainty estimates via multiagent consensus and scales with linear complexity to at least 10,000 polymers, enabling high-throughput screening at low computational cost. For a representative workload, the system completes inference in 16.3 s using about 2 GB of memory and 0.1 GPU hours, at an estimated cost of about $0.08. On a dedicated Tg benchmark, our approach attains R2 = 0.78, outperforming strong baselines including single-LLM prediction (R2 = 0.67), group-contribution methods (R2 = 0.71), and ChemCrow (R2 = 0.66). We further demonstrate metacognitive control in a polystyrene case study, where the system not only produces domain-level scientific outputs but continually monitors and optimizes its own behavior through tactical, strategic, and meta-strategic self-assessment.

Title: Microfluidic Fabrication and Analysis of Biocompatible, Monodisperse DNA-Hydrogels with Tunable Swelling and Dissolution Kinetics
Authors: Corinna Torabi, Takayuki Suzuki, Emily Helm, Harrison Khoo, Sophie Tanengaum, Rebecca Schulman, Soojung Claire Hur
Abstract: Stimulus-responsive DNA-hydrogels with swelling capabilities are a promising class of materials for biomedical applications such as drug delivery and biosensing. Designing these systems remains challenging because fabrication methods must be simultaneously biocompatible and conserve scarce DNA materials, even at the microscale. Moreover, stimulus-induced swelling must be precisely controlled and shown to drive measurable changes in molecular properties. We present a biocompatible fabrication and characterization method for micron-scale DNA-hydrogels with tunable isotropic swelling and dissolving properties. We first developed a fabrication method demonstrating that both the hydrogel composition and the fabrication process itself are biocompatible, while also minimizing the consumption of valuable DNA reagents. We then demonstrated modular control over isotropic swelling in micron-scale DNA microgels, achieving up to a two-fold size increase with tunable swelling through defined design parameters. We further established a quantitative workflow to measure structural changes of spherical, swollen and unswelled microgels leveraging the diffusive properties of a DNA-binding dye. Finally, we demonstrate tunable dissolving of microgels and quantitatively reveal various experimental factors that influence dissolution rates beyond what is traditionally considered in microgel experiments. Together, these advances establish a biocompatible platform for the fabrication and analysis of stimulus-responsive DNA micro-hydrogels, providing a foundation for their future use in drug delivery, biosensing, and related biomedical technologies.

Title: Plasticity, hysteresis, and recovery mechanisms in spider silk fibers
Authors: Renata Olivé, José Pérez-Riguero, Noy Cohen
Abstract: Spider silk is a remarkable biomaterial with exceptional stiffness, strength, and toughness stemming from a unique microstructure. While recent studies show that silk fibers exhibit plasticity, hysteresis, and recovery under cyclic loading, the underlying microstructural mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this work, we propose a mechanism explaining the loading-unloading-relaxation response through microstructural evolution: initial loading distorts intermolecular bonds, resulting in a linear elastic regime. Upon reaching the yield stress, these bonds dissociate and the external load is transferred to the polypeptide chains, which deform entropically to allow large deformations. Unloading is driven by entropic shortening until a traction free state with residual stretch is achieved. Subsequently, the fiber recovers as chains reorganize and bonds reform, locking the microstructure into a new stable equilibrium that increases stiffness in subsequent cycles. Following these mechanisms, we develop a microscopically motivated, energy-based model that captures the macroscopic response of silk fibers under cyclic loading. The response is decoupled into two parallel networks: (1) an elasto-plastic network of inter- and intramolecular bonds governing the initial stiffness and yield stress, and (2) an elastic network of entropic chains that enable large deformations. The model is validated against experimental data from Argiope bruennichi dragline silk. The findings from this work are three-fold: (1) explaining the mechanisms that govern hysteresis and recovery and linking them to microstructural evolution; (2) quantifying the recovery process of the fiber, which restores and enhances mechanical properties; and (3) establishing a predictive foundation for engineering synthetic fibers with customized properties.

Title: Towards Agentic Intelligence for Materials Science

Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and materials science presents a transformative opportunity, but achieving true acceleration in discovery requires moving beyond task-isolated, fine-tuned models toward agentic systems that plan, act, and learn across the full discovery loop. This survey advances a unique pipeline-centric view that spans from corpus curation and pretraining, through domain adaptation and instruction tuning, to goal-conditioned agents interfacing with simulation and experimental platforms. Unlike prior reviews, we treat the entire process as an end-to-end system to be optimized for tangible discovery outcomes rather than proxy benchmarks. This perspective allows us to trace how upstream design choices-such as data curation and training objectives-can be aligned with downstream experimental success through effective credit assignment. To bridge communities and establish a shared frame of reference, we first present an integrated lens that aligns terminology, evaluation, and workflow stages across AI and materials science. We then analyze the field through two focused lenses: From the AI perspective, the survey details LLM strengths in pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and natural language processing for literature mining, materials characterization, and property prediction; from the materials science perspective, it highlights applications in materials design, process optimization, and the acceleration of computational workflows via integration with external tools (e.g., DFT, robotic labs). Finally, we contrast passive, reactive approaches with agentic design, cataloging current contributions while motivating systems that pursue long-horizon goals with autonomy, memory, and tool use. This survey charts a practical roadmap towards autonomous, safety-aware LLM agents aimed at discovering novel and useful materials.

Title: QUASAR: A Universal Autonomous System for Atomistic Simulation and a Benchmark of Its Capabilities
Authors: Fengxu Yang, Jack D. Evans
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into materials science offers a transformative opportunity to streamline computational workflows, yet current agentic systems remain constrained by rigid tool-calling approaches and narrowly scoped agents. In this work, we introduce QUASAR, a universal autonomous system for atomistic simulation designed to facilitate production-grade scientific discovery. QUASAR autonomously orchestrates complex multi-scale workflows across diverse methods, including density functional theory, machine learning potentials, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulations. The system incorporates robust mechanisms for adaptive planning, context-efficient memory management, and hybrid knowledge retrieval to navigate real-world research scenarios without human intervention. We benchmark QUASAR against a series of three-tiered tasks, progressing from routine tasks to frontier research challenges such as photocatalyst screening and novel material assessment. These results suggest that QUASAR can function as a general atomistic reasoning system rather than a task-specific automation framework. They also provide initial evidence supporting the potential deployment of agentic AI as a component of computational chemistry research workflows, while identifying areas requiring further development.

Title: Topological Defects from Quantum Reset Dynamics
Authors: R. Jafari, Henrik Johannesson, Sebastian Eggert
Abstract: We analyze mechanisms for universal out-of-equilibrium dynamics near criticality by exploring the effect of randomized quantum resetting (QR) under a finite-time quench across a quantum phase transition. Using the transverse-field Ising chain as a generic model and exploiting its exact solution, QR is found to cause a crossover of the scaling of the topological defect density with the time scale $\tau$ of the quench, from Kibble-Zurek to anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling as $\tau$ increases. This reflects a competition between non-adiabatic quench-driven excitations and QR, giving rise to local minima of the defect densities at optimal annealing times. These times and the corresponding local minima are shown to scale as universal power laws with the rate of QR. Additional results for the scaling of the mean excess energy suggest that a system driven across a quantum critical point exhibits the same scaling behavior under a linear quench with QR as with uncorrelated noise.

Title: Discrete holography and density of states in the crossover from hyperbolic to Euclidean lattices
Authors: Mireia Tolosa-Simeón, Igor Boettcher
Abstract: We study tight-binding models in the crossover from hyperbolic to Euclidean lattices, realized through the successive insertion of Euclidean defects into hyperbolic lattices. We analyze how the holographic two-point boundary correlation function and bulk density of states evolve as defects are gradually introduced. We find that bulk properties are strongly affected by the presence of Euclidean defects, whereas boundary observables remain remarkably robust even at high defect fractions. This robustness indicates that essential features of boundary physics on hyperbolic lattices, which capture aspects of AdS/CFT-like dualities in discrete systems, can be reproduced both experimentally and numerically without requiring perfectly hyperbolic lattices, thereby reducing the system size needed for implementation.

Title: Gradient-expansion of the inhomogeneous electron-gas revisited
Authors: Mario Benites, Angel Rosado, Efstratios Manousakis
Abstract: In the present work, we revisit the problem of the inhomogeneous electron gas under the influence of a weak external potential, which allows us to calculate the gradient corrections to the density functional within linear response, an approach known as the gradient expansion approximation. To obtain the exchange ($b_x$) and correlation ($b_{c}$) contributions to the coefficient $b_{xc}$, i.e., to the prefactor of the $q^2$ term of the proper-polarization function, we revisited all the previous calculations and expose misconceptions which led to incorrect conclusions. We used various ways to apply a necessary regularization to the singular Coulomb interaction potential. We found that the separate exchange ($b_x$) and correlation ($b_c$) contributions to the coefficient $b_{xc}$ have regularization-scheme dependent values even though the regulator is set to zero at the end of the calculation. This implies that it is impossible to define such a separation meaningfully. On the contrary, we found that when the regulator is set to zero at the end of the calculation, the combination $b_{xc}$ is regularization-scheme independent and, thus, has a unique value. We conclude that it is incorrect to separate those two terms when constructing a generalized-gradient-approximation (GGA) contribution to the density functional. This appears to be a common approach in most popular GGA functionals, where various constraints are applied to each contribution separately.

Title: Machine Learning to Predict Spectral Anisotropy in Valence-to-Core X-ray Emission Spectroscopy
Authors: Charles A. Cardot, John Tichenor, Seth M. Shjandemaar, Josh J. Kas, Fernando D. Vila, Gerald T. Seidler, John J. Rehr
Abstract: Polarization analysis in x-ray spectroscopy provides an orientation dependent sensitivity to local bonding environments. For a cluster of atoms, polarization sensitivity is most often discussed through the lens of point group symmetries. However, this is a discrete, qualitative method of classifying clusters, and it does little to indicate the degree of spectral anisotropy. Here we adopt a random forest model for quantitative prediction of spectral anisotropy. Its input relies on simplified local geometric and chemical information that can be obtained from any crystal structure file. The model is trained on over 10,000 experimentally realized transition metal structures from the Materials Project, with the target being VtC-XES calculated using the real space Green's function code FEFF. We find that the model can strongly predict the degree of spectral anisotropy, with the primary factors being derived from the spatial moments of ligands in a cluster.

Title: Enhanced detection of circularly polarized photons with topological materials
Authors: Hamideh Sharifpour, George J. de Coster, Avik W. Ghosh
Abstract: Topological insulators (TI) are highly attractive platforms for next-generation optoelectronic and photonic devices. Spin-momentum locking of topological surface states enhance their nonlinear optical responses and sensitivities, especially to circularly polarized light. Until now, theoretical investigations of nonlinear responses in TIs have been limited to microscopic calculations on analytical continuum models, or leveraging density functional theory based Hamiltonians. In this work, we expand beyond these two approaches by employing a nonlinear Kubo formalism to calculate second-order nonlinear optical conductivity in a slab geometry using symmetry informed tight binding models that accurately reproduce the conduction, valence and topological surface bands in Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Our methodology enables us to study the layer resolved contribution to injection-currents coupled to the incident electric field. We demonstrate that our technique can reveal how device engineering modifies elements of the nonlinear optical response such as the circular photogalvanic effect by breaking inversion and time-reversal symmetry. We find, in line with experiments, that the photogalvanic current is sensitive to field effects, Fermi level energy, gate voltage and the energy of incident light. Our computed midwavelength infrared (mid-IR) responsivity $R \approx 0.169~\mathrm{\mu A/W}$ is comparable to reported TI and intrinsic 2D-material photodetectors. We further simulate experimentally unexplored methods to modify the circular photogalvanic effect such as proximitizing a magnetic field to one of the TI surface materials, suggesting a mechanism for optoelectronic tuning.

Title: A seven-facet polyhedron captures the composition-only formation-energy landscape of inorganic solids
Authors: Justin Tahmassebpur, Sarvesh Chaudhari, Cristóbal Méndez, Rushil Choudhary, Sudipta Kundu, Raymond E. Schaak, Héctor Abruña, Peter Frazier, Tomás Arias
Abstract: This work demonstrates that the convex hull of formation energies for solid compounds involving elements from hydrogen to uranium admits a remarkably simple description over the 92-dimensional space of chemical compositions, despite the enormous combinatorial complexity of possible atomic structures. By training an interpretable max-affine model directly on near-hull formation energies from the Materials Project density-functional theory (DFT) database, we find that the hull can be reconstructed to DFT accuracy using a polyhedron with only seven facets. These facets define seven chemically coherent materials classes, with just seven coefficients per element sufficing to capture the dominant energetic trends across composition space. Remarkably, this compact, composition-only representation generalizes far beyond bulk formation energies. Without retraining or structural input, the same model reproduces trends in DFT-calculated defect formation energies, captures experimentally observed elemental mixing correlations in high-entropy materials, and enables the construction and optimization of Pourbaix diagrams for electrochemical stability. Together, these results show that many materials properties governed by energy differences can be expressed as simple linear combinations of a small set of interpretable, element-specific parameters. The result is a bonding-geometry-free thermodynamic framework that unifies stability, defects, mixing, and electrochemistry, and enables rapid, interpretable screening across vast chemical spaces.

Title: Defects, Corrugation and Temperature Govern Rarefied-Air Drag on Graphene Coatings
Authors: Samuel Cajahuaringa, Davide Bidoggia, Maria Peressi, Antimo Marrazzo
Abstract: In rarefied atmospheric environments, where continuum fluid dynamics breaks down, aerodynamic drag is governed by gas-surface momentum exchange, making surface structure and chemistry key design knobs. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that coating the $\alpha$-Al2O3(0001) surface with graphene markedly reduces the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient (TMAC) of N2, shifting scattering toward more specular reflection and thereby lowering drag; we further benchmark this response against graphite. The reduction strengthens up to 900 K. While structural defects can increase TMAC via defect-induced corrugation and local atomic and electronic rearrangements, graphene retains its performance at experimentally relevant defect densities.

Title: Many-body contributions to polymorphism and polyhexaticity in a water monolayer
Authors: Oriol Vilanova, Giancarlo Franzese
Abstract: Nanoconfined water plays a crucial role in nanofluidics, biology, and cutting-edge technologies. The process of melting water monolayers and quasi-two-dimensional confined water involves, as an intermediate stage, the hexatic phase--a state that lies between solid and liquid and is characterized by quasi-long-range orientational order and short-range translational order. However, the influence of hydrogen bond (HB) cooperativity in this process has not been thoroughly investigated. This gap hampers our understanding of the phase behavior of confined water and limits the accuracy of our models. To address this, we extend the water model developed by Franzese and Stanley, which explicitly includes many-body interactions (MBIs) of HBs. We distinguish the contributions of three-body and five-body HB-MBIs. Our Monte Carlo calculations in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble produces a detailed pressure-temperature phase diagram, revealing polymorphism and polyhexaticity: low-density square ice and high-density triangular ice are separated from the liquid phase by distinct hexatic phases. Three-body interactions notably promote crystallization and can destabilize the low-density hexatic phase, while cooperative five-body interactions help restore it, thus modifying the thermodynamic landscape. These findings demonstrate that HB-MBIs are key in determining the phase behavior of confined water, influencing phenomena such as the non-monotonic specific heat, maximum density lines, and the accessibility of the liquid-liquid critical point. Beyond advancing theoretical understanding, these results have wide-ranging implications for nanofluidics, interfacial science, and applications in biology, food technology, and pharmaceutics, where controlling water under confinement is essential.

Title: On the Landauer formula in interfacial thermal transport
Authors: Jinghang Dai, Zhiting Tian
Abstract: In this commentary, we clarify that the Landauer formula is not limited to the phonon gas model. It is fundamentally more general and applies to both particle- and wave-based descriptions of phonons, provided the transmission function is well defined. In the harmonic regime, the phonon transmission function and the resulting Landauer expression for heat current are exact. They can be rigorously derived using the atomistic Green's function method, which treats phonons as waves and does not require phonon dispersion in the interface region. In short, the Landauer framework remains valid for ideal, disordered, and defective interfaces, as long as an appropriate transmission function is used.

Title: Deriving Reliable Nucleation Rates from Metadynamics Simulations: Application to Yukawa Fluids
Authors: B. Arnold, J. Daligault, D. Saumon, S. X. Hu
Abstract: In order to solidify the usefulness of metadynamics in studying nucleation of crystals from supercooled liquids, we provide a specific procedure to calculate nucleation free energy barriers. After a pedagogical review of the important elements of classical nucleation theory and how metadynamics is used to find nucleation free energy barriers, we explain the benefits of local collective variables over more common global collective variables. We show how a metadynamics free energy barrier must be carefully postprocessed so that classical nucleation theory can be applied to calculate nucleation rates. We apply our procedure to a Yukawa plasma and show that a particular physically-motivated fit to metadynamics data reproduces low-temperature reference data, justifying the usefulness of metadynamics to predict nucleation rates and the nucleation critical temperature.

Title: Memory effects govern scale-free dynamics beyond universality classes
Authors: K. Duplat, A. Douin, O. Ramos
Abstract: Scale-invariant avalanches -- with events of all sizes following power-law distributions -- are considered critical. Above the upper critical dimension of four, the mean-field solution with a robust $3/2$ size exponent describes the dynamics. In two and three dimensions, spatial constraints yield smaller yet robust exponent values governed by universality classes. However, both earthquake data and experiments often show exponent values larger than $3/2$, challenging those theoretical arguments based on critical behavior. Through extensive simulations in the classical OFC earthquake model, here we show a clear transition from the theoretical expected behavior of a robust exponent value, to a regime of quasi-critical dynamics with larger than $3/2$ exponents that depend on dissipation. While the first critical regime exhibits an inherently memoryless behavior, both the transition and the second regime are driven by memory effects provoked by the growth of avalanches over the traces left by previous events, due to dissipative mechanisms. The system hovers at a distance $d_{cp}$ from the critical point, and accounting for a power-law distribution of $d_{cp}$, validated by susceptibility measurements, captures the transition. This framework provides a unified description of both critical and quasi-critical behavior, and thus of the full spectrum of scale-free dynamics observed in nature.

Title: Interatomic potentials for platinum
Authors: R. K. Koju, Y. Li, Y. Mishin
Abstract: We present two new interatomic potentials for platinum (Pt) in angular-dependent potential (ADP) and modified Tersoff (MT) formats. Both potentials have been trained on a reference database of first-principles calculations without using experimental data. The properties of Pt predicted by the ADP and MT potentials agree better with DFT calculations and experimental data than the potentials available in the literature. Future applications of the MT model to mixed-bonding metal-covalent systems are discussed.

Title: Continuously tunable dipolar exciton geometry for controlling bosonic quantum phase transitions

Abstract: The geometry and binding energy of excitons, set by electron-hole wavefunction distributions, are fundamental factors that underpin their many-body interactions and determine optoelectronic properties of semiconductors. However, in typical solid-state systems, these quantities are fixed by material composition and structure. Here we introduce a polarizable interlayer exciton hosted in a two-dimensional tetralayer heterostructure whose dipole length, in-plane radius, and binding energy can be continuously programmed in situ over a wide range, enabling direct control over the nature of excitonic many-body phase transitions. An out-of-plane electric field redistributes layer-hybridized electron-hole wavefunctions, realizing in situ control of exciton geometry through a strong quadratic Stark response. This tunability further regulates the nature of interaction-driven Mott transition, transforming it from gradual to abrupt. Our results establish exciton geometry as a continuously tunable materials parameter, opening routes to exciton-based quantum phase-transition simulators and guiding the design of emergent optoelectronic functionalities from programmable excitonic materials.

Title: Ammonia Catalyst Evolution Under Reactor Conditions Revealed by Environmental and Multimodal Electron Microscopy
Authors: Amy S. McKeown-Green, Parivash Moradifar, Zisheng Zhang, Cedric Lim, Andrew Barnum, Lin Yuan, Robert Sinclair, Frank Abild-Pedersen, Colin Ophus, Jennifer A. Dionne
Abstract: Bimetallic catalysts provide new routes toward sustainable ammonia synthesis, but the structural dynamics controlling their performance under real-world conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we combine in situ gas-cell and multimodal electron microscopy to disentangle the temperature-, pressure-, and chemistry-dependent restructuring of AuRu catalysts, revealing pathways accessible only at atmospheric pressure. As synthesized, AuRu nanocatalysts are polycrystalline face-centered-cubic alloys with Au/Ru intermixing that phase-segregate into Au- and Ru-rich domains with elevated temperature (>450 °C). Increased pressure (~1 atm in 3:1, hydrogen:nitrogen) unlocks pronounced faceting and internal nanovoid formation, which systematic gas-chemistry variation identifies as hydrogen-driven. Density functional theory-based interatomic potentials show that hydrogen can amplify Au/Ru diffusion asymmetry, promoting nanovoid formation via a gas-mediated Kirkendall mechanism. Together, these results bridge the pressure gap between traditional in situ electron microscopy and benchtop ammonia reactors, enabling resolution of distinct restructuring stimuli in multicomponent systems.

Title: Electron-phonon interactions and instabilities in Weyl semimetals under magnetic fields and torsional strain
Authors: Fabian Jofre Parra, Daniel A. Bonilla, Enrique Muñoz
Abstract: We study the presence of an external magnetic field, in combination with torsional strain, over the electron-phonon interactions in a type I Weyl semimetal. This particular superposition of field and strain, modeled in the continuum approximation by an effective gauge field, leads to an asymmetric pseudo-magnetic field at each Weyl node of opposite chirality. Therefore, we also studied the role of nodal asymmetry in the properties of the system by means of the Kadanoff-Wilson renormalization group and the corresponding flow equations. By solving those, we discuss the evolution of the coupling parameters of the theory, and analyze possible fixed points and lattice (Peierls) instabilities emerging from interactions between phonons with the chiral Landau level in the very strong pseudo-magnetic field regime.

Title: Upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpy in multi-component cubic halide perovskite alloys
Authors: Xiuwen Zhang, Fernando P. Sabino, Jia-Xin Xiong, Alex Zunger
Abstract: Physical properties intermediate between constituents of alloys can be achieved as downward convex positive bowing, upward concave negative bowing, or zero bowing. Such bowing effects are essential for band gap engineering in semiconductor alloys. Upward band gap bowing effects are rather rare, hindering the exploration on half of the available physical property space of alloys. Part of the this being a rare event is related to the need to stabilize an alloy with low mixing enthalpy, so it does not phase separate. In this paper we find via density functional theory that one can satisfy the simultaneous conditions of negative mixing enthalpy and upward band gap bowing in four-component ABX3 halide perovskite alloys in the cubic perovskite structure. Such perovskite alloys have the B-site occupied by a mixture of group IVB and IIB elements that have the IVB-s and IIB-s states in the valence bands and conduction bands, respectively, leaving the delocalized s states strongly repel each other. This s-s repulsion leads to the upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpies simultaneously. Remarkably, we identify a perovskite alloy that has a band gap much larger than all its components. Analogous trends of upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpy also appear in the corresponding three-component and two-component ABX3 halide perovskite alloys. These observations of upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpy will significantly accelerate the design of stable upward band gap bowing alloys in a broad range of material families.

Title: Exactly solvable higher-order Liouvillian exceptional points in dissipative fermionic systems
Authors: Mingtao Xu, Wei Yi
Abstract: We propose a general class of open fermionic models where quadratic Liouvillians governing the dissipative dynamics feature exactly solvable higher-order exceptional points (EPs). Invoking the formalism of third quantization, we show that, among the multiple EPs of Liouvillian, an EP with its order approaching the system size arises as the quasisteady state of the system, leading to a gapless Liouvillian spectrum. By introducing perturbations, in the form of many-body quantum-jump processes, these higher-order EPs break down, leading to finite Liouvillian gaps with fractional power-law scalings. While the power-law scaling is a signature of the higher-order EP, its explicit form is sensitively dependent on the many-body perturbation. Finally, we discuss the steady-state approaching dynamic which can serve as detectable signals for the higher-order Liouvillian EPs.

Title: Unified origin of negative energetic elasticity in a lattice polymer chain: soft self-repulsion and bending stiffness
Authors: Nobu C. Shirai
Abstract: We study a single lattice polymer chain under a fixed end-to-end distance, incorporating both Domb--Joyce (DJ) soft-core self-repulsion between polymer segments and a local bending-energy cost. By decomposing the stiffness into energetic and entropic contributions, we survey the parameter space defined by the self-repulsion strength and bending-energy cost. We find that the energetic contribution to stiffness is negative across the entire explored range, whereas the entropic contribution remains positive. These results unify two previously independent mechanisms of negative energetic elasticity -- solvent-induced self-repulsion and bending stiffness -- and demonstrate that either mechanism alone, as well as their combination, produces the same sign. Beyond this sign-level unification, we analyze the internal-energy scaling and show that, in the absence of the bending-energy term, the DJ (self-repulsion) limit exhibits a robust $(n-r)^{7/4}/n$ scaling collapse. In contrast, the introduction of finite bending stiffness progressively disrupts this scaling, providing an internal-energy-based diagnostic to distinguish between contributions from self-repulsion and bending stiffness.

Title: Synergistic effect of the electronic band delocalization and bond anharmonicity on the thermoelectric performance of Cs2TeX6(X=Cl, Br, I)
Authors: Heena, Vineet Kumar Pandey, Saanvi Marethiya, Ambesh Dixit, Ajay Singh Verma, K.C. Bhamu
Abstract: We investigate the structural, mechanical, and thermoelectric properties of lead-free double halide perovskites Cs2TeX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) using first-principles calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. The HSE06 band gap is incorporated using the scissor correction method along with PBE calculated electronic band structures including spin orbit coupling to accurately predict transport properties. The band gap values are 3.27, 2.50, and 1.55 eV for Cs2TeX6 (X = Cl, Br, I), respectively. The coexistence of heavy and light bands in the Cs2TeI6 band structure helps mitigate the trade-off between the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. Among these systems, Cs2TeI6 exhibits superior performance with a ZT of 1.97 at 800 K and an electronic concentration of 3.35 x 10^19 cm^-3. Such a high ZT at relatively low carrier concentration arises from high electrical conductivity combined with low lattice thermal conductivity. The lattice thermal conductivity of Cs2TeI6 is found to be 0.41 W m^-1 K^-1 at room temperature. This low lattice thermal conductivity is attributed to weak Te-I bonding and non-uniform out-of-phase displacement of Cs atoms. The presence of local TeX6 units together with weak bonds strongly resists heat conduction, leading to significant suppression of lattice thermal conductivity. In particular, transverse acoustic phonons and optical phonons play a key role in limiting lattice thermal conductivity. These results identify Cs2TeI6 as a promising candidate for high performance thermoelectric applications.

Title: Floquet quantum geometry in periodically driven topological insulators
Authors: Peng He, Jian-Te Wang, Jiangbin Gong, Hai-Tao Ding
Abstract: Quantum geometry plays a fundamental role across many branches of modern physics, yet its full characterization in nonequilibrium systems remains a challenge. Here, we propose a framework for quantum geometry in Floquet topological insulators by introducing a time-resolved quantum metric tensor, defined via the trace distance between micromotion operators in momentum-time space. For class A in two spatial dimensions, we find a general inequality linking the Floquet quantum metric tensor and the Floquet topology: the associated quantum volume is bounded below by the Floquet topological invariant. This relation is found to also hold in class AIII in one dimension, where the Floquet geometric tensor may be notably reduced due to time-reflection symmetry. This work will be useful in digesting the general aspects of quantum geometry in periodically driven systems in connection with their topological characterization.

Title: Multimodal Machine Learning for Integrating Heterogeneous Analytical Systems
Authors: Shun Muroga, Hideaki Nakajima, Taiyo Shimizu, Kazufumi Kobashi, Kenji Hata
Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships in complex materials requires integrating complementary measurements across multiple length scales. Here we propose an interpretable "multimodal" machine learning framework that unifies heterogeneous analytical systems for end-to-end characterization, demonstrated on carbon nanotube (CNT) films whose properties are highly sensitive to microstructural variations. Quantitative morphology descriptors are extracted from SEM images via binarization, skeletonization, and network analysis, capturing curvature, orientation, intersection density, and void geometry. These SEM-derived features are fused with Raman indicators of crystallinity/defect states, specific surface area from gas adsorption, and electrical surface resistivity. Multi-dimensional visualization using radar plots and UMAP reveals clear clustering of CNT films according to crystallinity and entanglements. Regression models trained on the multimodal feature set show that nonlinear approaches, particularly XGBoost, achieve the best predictive accuracy under leave-one-out cross-validation. Feature-importance analysis further provides physically meaningful interpretations: surface resistivity is primarily governed by junction-to-junction transport length scales, crystallinity/defect-related metrics, and network connectivity, whereas specific surface area is dominated by intersection density and void size. The proposed multimodal machine learning framework offers a general strategy for data-driven, explainable characterization of complex materials.

Title: The Impact of Geometric Blockade on Thermoelectric Transport in Triangular Triple Quantum Dots
Authors: Shuo Dong, Yiming Liu, Junqing Li, Jianhua Wei
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of a triangular triple quantum dot (TTQD) system connected with two reservoirs under linear response regime. By employing the hierarchical equations of motion(HEOM), we compute the thermopower and thermoelectric figure of merit. The impact of interaction scheme among three quantum dots on the thermopower is thoroughly analyzed, while the thermoelectric current and spectral function throughout this process are also elaborated. Our results reveal that, under low-temperature conditions, the alleviation of the geometric blockade in the TTQD system leads to a significantly faster enhancement of the heat current compared to the electric current. This phenomenon consequently elevates the thermopower, resulting in a remarkably high thermoelectric figure of merit.

Title: Josephson Oscillation and Nonlinear Self-Trapping in Quasi-one-dimensional Quantum Liquid
Authors: Shivam Singh, Ibrar, Suhail Rashid, Ayan Khan
Abstract: In this article, we study the two-mode method to analyze the Josephson oscillation for a trapped binary Bose-Einstein condensate while taking into account the beyond mean-field and three body interactions. For this purpose, we use the archetypal model of double well potential and study the Josephson oscillation and self-trapping phases in quasi-one dimension. Additionally, our analysis provides quantitative discussion on the effect of asymmetry and dimension. We further corroborate our findings with Bogoliubov quasi-particle method and notice regions of instabilities and roton like mode.

Title: Momentum- and frequency-resolved collective electronic excitations in solids: insights from spectroscopy and first-principles calculations
Authors: Dario A. Leon, Kristian Berland
Abstract: Collective electronic excitations, including plasmons, excitons, and intra- and interband transitions, play a central role in determining the dynamic screening, optical response, and energy transport properties of materials. Recent advances in momentum- and frequency-resolved spectroscopies, such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS), together with progress in first-principles many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculations, now allow collective excitations to be mapped with considerable precision across the Brillouin zone. This topical review surveys current developments in the representation and interpretation of both experimental and theoretical dielectric-response spectra. Particular emphasis is placed on recent ways of representing spectral band structures (SBS) of the direct and inverse dielectric functions, such as analytical approaches based on multipole-Padé approximants in momentum and frequency (MPA($\q$)), which provide a combined band-like description of the dispersion of the main collective excitations. We discuss how features observed in metals, semiconductors, and low dimensional systems reflect the interplay between electronic structure, screening strength, and local-field effects, and how post-processing procedures can improve the quantitative comparison between experiment and theory. Finally, we provide perspectives on open challenges and potential developments in quantitative dielectric-function analyses.

Title: Van Hove singularity-induced multiple magnetic transitions in multi-orbital systems
Authors: Chen Lu, Lun-Hui Hu
Abstract: Van Hove singularities (VHSs) amplify electronic correlations, providing a crucial platform for discovering novel quantum phase transitions. Here, we show that VHSs in multi-orbital systems can stabilize a variety of competing $\bm{Q}=0$ magnetic orders, including intrinsic altermagnetism emerging from spontaneous orbital antiferromagnetism. This intrinsic phase, in which antiparallel spins reside on distinct orbitals, is realized across all four 2D Bravais lattices. It is driven by orbital-resolved spin fluctuations enhanced by inter-orbital hopping and favors suppressed Hund's coupling $J_H$, strong inter-orbital hybridization, and filling near a VHS from quadratic band touching. Through Hubbard-$U$-$J_H$ phase diagrams we map several magnetic phase transitions: (i) ferrimagnet to $d$-wave extrinsic altermagnet, (ii) $d$-wave intrinsic altermagnet to ferromagnet, and (iii) $g$-wave extrinsic altermagnet to either $d$-wave extrinsic altermagnet or ferromagnet. Our work identifies VHSs as a generic route to altermagnetism in correlated materials.

Title: A New Workflow for Materials Discovery Bridging the Gap Between Experimental Databases and Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Brandon Schoener, Yuting Hu, Pasit Wanlapha, Akshay Rengarajan, Ian Moog, Michael Wang, Peihong Zhang, Jinjun Xiong, Hao Zeng
Abstract: Incorporating Machine Learning (ML) into material property prediction has become a crucial step in accelerating materials discovery. A key challenge is the severe lack of training data, as many properties are too complicated to calculate with high-throughput first principles techniques. To address this, recent research has created experimental databases from information extracted from scientific literature. However, most existing experimental databases do not provide full atomic coordinate information, which prevents them from supporting advanced ML architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this work, we propose to bridge this gap through an alignment process between experimental databases and Crystallographic Information Files (CIF) from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Our approach enables the creation of a database that can fully leverage state-of-the-art model architectures for material property prediction. It also opens the door to utilizing transfer learning to improve prediction accuracy. To validate our approach, we align NEMAD with the ICSD and compare models trained on the resulting database to those trained on NEMAD originally. We demonstrate significant improvements in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Correct Classification Rate (CCR) in predicting the ordering temperatures and magnetic ground states of magnetic materials, respectively.

Title: Disproportionate influence of site disorder on the evolution of magnetic phases in anti-Heusler alloy Al$_2$MnFe

Abstract: Anti-Heusler alloys, being a new addition to the Heusler alloys family, exhibit atomic disorders, and almost all of them are reported as a re-entrant spin-glass system. Although such spin-glass feature is generally attributed to the inherent atomic disorder, a comprehensive and extensive investigation on the individual roles of different types of disorders in magnetic interactions remains lacking for any of the reported anti-Heusler systems. As an illustrative case, we have carried out an in-depth experimental as well as theoretical investigation of structural, magnetic, and transport properties of a polycrystalline anti-Heusler alloy, Al$_2$MnFe. While the major atomic disorder is found to be among Fe and Mn atoms, which are randomly distributed among the two octahedral sites, 4$a$ and 4$b$ (B2-type disorder), a relatively small fraction ($\sim$12\%) of Mn atoms also replace Al atoms at the tetrahedral 8$c$ site. Magnetically, the system undergoes two transitions: a paramagnetic to a ferromagnetic transition at $T_{\rm C}\sim$113~K, followed by a spin-glass phase transition below $T_{\rm f}\sim$20~K. Here, the magnetic moment is primarily confined to Mn atoms. Very interestingly, our theoretical analysis reveals that the ferromagnetic spin arrangement remains rather robust in spite of the 50\% disorder of moment-carrying Mn atoms between the two octahedral sites, but a much smaller ($\sim$12\%) cross-distribution of Mn atoms between octahedral and tetrahedral sites are sufficient to impose a reentrant spin-glass state at low temperature. Our analysis brings forth the importance of understanding the role of individual types of swap-disorder on magnetic properties in the anti-Heusler family of materials.

Title: Observing quantum phase transitions at non-zero temperature: non-analytic behavior of order-parameter correlation times
Authors: István Csépányi, Giuseppe Del Vecchio Del Vecchio, Benjamin Doyon, Márton Kormos
Abstract: Phase transitions occur when a macroscopic number of local degrees of freedom coherently change their behavior. In ground states of quantum many-body systems, phase transitions due to quantum fluctuations are observed as non-analytic behaviors of order parameters, such as magnetization, as functions of a conjugate parameter, such as the magnetic field. However, as soon as thermal fluctuations are present, these effects are believed to disappear for local observables. We show that this is not necessarily the case: order parameters may still show non-analytic behaviors within their dynamics. With the example of the Ising model and using methods based on hydrodynamic fluctuations, we evaluate the exact order-parameter correlation time, in space-time directions of all velocities, in equilibrium states at nonzero temperature. We reveal non-analytic behaviors of spin correlation times as functions of the magnetic field, velocity, and temperature. As a function of the magnetic field, they occur at values that continuously approach that of the zero-temperature equilibrium transition point as the velocity is decreased and reach it within the light cone, where we obtain a new, temperature-independent logarithmic divergence characterizing the collective dynamics. Thus, collective effects induced by quantum fluctuations persist within the dynamics of local observables.

Title: Elastic, Quasielastic, and Superelastic Electron Scattering from Thermal Lattice Distortions in Perfect Crystals
Authors: Eric J. Heller, Anton M. Graf, Yubo Zhang, Alhun Aydin., Joonas Keski-Rahkonen
Abstract: In conventional treatments of electron transport, momentum relaxation within a perfect, defect free crystal is commonly assumed to require phonon creation or annihilation. Here we treat the crystal as finite and isolated, retaining the lattice center of mass (recoil) degree of freedom and enforcing conservation of total mechanical momentum alongside discrete crystal pseudomomentum. Starting from the density density form of the electron lattice interaction, we find that an electron in the interior of a perfect crystal admits strong, and in some regimes dominant, elastic momentum relaxing scattering channels, in which momentum is conserved by recoil of the lattice background without phonon excitation. In addition, we identify mixed quasielastic and superelastic channels in which phonon occupations change but do not account fully for the electron's momentum transfer. These results provide a microscopic basis for momentum relaxation that does not rely on local energy dissipation. They naturally reconcile a wide range of experimental observations, including weak localization, quantum oscillations, ultrasonic attenuation, and the separation of momentum and energy relaxation times, with predominantly elastic scattering in clean crystals. The framework clarifies how diffusive transport, including Planckian scale diffusion, can emerge from elastic dynamics in a time dependent lattice background.

Title: An Open-Source Framework for Measurement and Analysis of Nanoscale Ionic Transport
Authors: Yichao Wang, Munan Fang, Aziz Roshanbhai Lokhandwala, Siddhi Vinayak Pandey, Boya Radha
Abstract: Nanofluidic systems exploit nanometre-scale confinement in channels and pores to regulate ionic transport, enabling functionalities such as osmotic energy harvesting and neuromorphic ionic memory. Studying such confined transport requires both precise electrical instrumentation and careful data analysis, yet, in practice, measurements are still often taken with vendor software, exported as files, and processed later in separate environments. In this work, we bring these steps together in a unified Python-based framework built around three interoperable graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for nanochannel, nanopore and memristor experiments. The framework is organised into two functional parts, measurement and analysis. On the measurement side, two GUIs drive Keithley Source Meters to run continuous voltage sweeps and user-defined memristive pulse sequences, while providing live plots, configuration management and controlled shutdown routines. On the analysis side, a dedicated nanochannel and nanopore GUI reads raw I-V datasets, applies unit-consistent processing, extracts conductance and ion mobility, evaluates selectivity and osmotic power, and is complemented by a web-based calculator that performs the same mobility analysis without a local Python installation. All three GUIs are implemented in Python/Tkinter with modular plotting and logging layers so that flexible control sequences and physics-based post-processing share a common data format, improving reproducibility, timing stability and day-to-day efficiency in nanofluidic and electronic device studies.

Title: Ferroelectric quantum critical point in superconducting hydrides: The case of H$_3$S
Authors: Marco Cherubini, Abhishek Raghav, Michele Casula
Abstract: H$_3$S sulfur hydride has been widely investigated for its high superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ of 203 K at about $p_c = 155$ GPa. Despite being the precursor of superconducting hydrides, a detailed picture of its phase diagram in an extended temperature and pressure range is still missing. To determine it with inclusion of both thermal and quantum effects, we carry out path integral molecular dynamics combined to a MACE neural network potential trained on BLYP density functional theory configurations. The resulting H$_3$S phase diagram is characterized by the ferroelectric transition between the Im$\bar{3}$m and R3m phases, which originates from a quantum critical point (QCP) located at $p_\mathrm{QCP} \approx 134$ GPa. We show that the experimental $T_c$ peak falls into a paraelectric region of large nuclear quantum fluctuations above the ferroelectric QCP, as measured by local phonon Green's functions resolved in imaginary time, where fluctuating dipole moments are at play. We study the critical behavior of the system in the proximity of the QCP by a finite-size scaling analysis, showing that it belongs to the 4D Ising universality class. We finally discuss its implications for the superconducting state.

Title: Plateau moduli of Kremer-Grest models for commodity polymer melts
Authors: Carsten Svaneborg, Ralf Everaers
Abstract: We estimate the plateau moduli of highly entangled end-pinned bead-spring polymer melts with Z = 100 and Z = 200 from the time-dependent elastic response to a step strain, which we first extrapolate to infinite time and then interpolate to zero strain. We present data for systems deformed in the melt state as well as for systems deformed at the primitive path level following the recent iPPA protocol. We observe excellent agreement between the plateau moduli obtained via the two deformation protocols and good agreement with the available experimental data for commodity polymer melts using a common mapping on the Kuhn scale.

Title: Critical Temperatures from Domain-Wall Microstate Counting: A Topological Solution for the Potts Universality Class
Authors: David Vaknin
Abstract: We derive a universal relation for the critical temperatures of the $q$-state Potts model based on the counting of domain-wall microstates. By balancing interface energy against configurational entropy, we show that the critical temperature is determined by the ratio of the coordination-dependent energy cost to the logarithm of a total multiplicity factor. This factor decomposes into a lattice-topological constant, representing a projection from an underlying orthogonal Euclidean space, and a term representing Markovian sampling in the $q$-dimensional state space. The framework recovers exact solutions for two-dimensional square, triangular, and honeycomb lattices and achieves sub-3\% accuracy for three-dimensional simple cubic, bcc, fcc, and diamond geometries. This approach unifies the Potts universality class into a single geometric classification, revealing that the phase transition is governed by the saturation of interface propagation through the lattice manifold and providing a predictive tool that characterizes the entire $q$-state family from a single topological calibration.

Title: Soft 3D Metamaterial for Low-Frequency Elastic Waves
Authors: Thomas Daunizeau, David Gueorguiev, Vincent Hayward, Allison Okamura, Sinan Haliyo
Abstract: Acoustic metamaterials offer exceptional control over wave propagation, but their potential remains unfulfilled due to fabrication constraints. Conventional processes yield mostly rigid, planar structures, whereas soft-matter alternatives have so far been confined to ultrasounds. This work overcomes prior limitations with a fully soft 3D metamaterial operating around 200Hz. The design combines a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with resonant inclusions of liquid metal, injected via a network of mesofluidic channels. Its dynamic response is derived from a hybrid strategy uniting a lumped-element model with finite element analysis. Simulations reveal how the dual-phase design decouples flexural and torsional modes, opening a subwavelength band gap for low-frequency elastic waves. Empirical validation is achieved via a custom camera-based vibrometer. Its high spatiotemporal resolution and full-field capabilities enable direct capture of local modes and evanescent waves underlying the band gap. Accelerometer data corroborate these findings and demonstrate greater attenuation than common silicone elastomers at only half of the density. By combining scalable fabrication, compliance, and operations at frequencies relevant to human tactile perception, this novel metamaterial paves the way for lightweight, high-performance cushioning and handles that protect users from harmful vibration exposure.

Title: Leaves of preferential attachment trees
Authors: Harrison Hartle, P. L. Krapivsky
Abstract: We provide a local probabilistic description of the limiting statistics of large preferential attachment trees in terms of the ordinary degree (number of neighbors) but augmented with information on leafdegree (number of neighbors that are leaves). The full description is the joint degree-leafdegree distribution $n_{k,\ell}$, which we derive from its associated multivariate generating function. From $n_{k,\ell}$ we obtain the leafdegree distribution, $m_{\ell}$, as well as the fraction of vertices that are protected (nonleaves with leafdegree zero) as a function of degree, $n_{k,0}$, among numerous other results. We also examine fluctuations and concentration of joint degree-leafdegree empirical counts $N_{k,\ell}$. Although our main findings pertain to the preferential attachment tree, the approach we present is highly generalizable and can characterize numerous existing models, in addition to facilitating the development of tractable new models. We further demonstrate the approach by analyzing $n_{k,\ell}$ in two other models: the random recursive tree, and a redirection-based model.

Title: From shape to fate: making bacterial swarming expansion predictable
Authors: Shengyou Duan, Zhaoyang Wang, Kaiyi Xiong, Jin Zhu, Pengxi Gu, Weijie Chen, Hongyi Xin, Zijie Qu
Abstract: Microbial swarming on mucosal surfaces reshapes microbial communities and influences mucosal healing and antibiotic tolerance. Yet even with time-lapse microscopy and deep learning, analyses of swarming colonies remain descriptive and cannot forecast how their fronts reorganize in time. This limitation is significant because the advancing edge determines access to nutrients, host tissue and competing microbes. We recast the expansion of Enterobacter sp. SM3 swarms as a problem of morphological forecasting, and assemble SwarmEvo, a time-lapse dataset represented as boundary-resolved segmentations. TexPol--Net, a texture- and geometry-aware segmentation model, sharpens diffuse edges and preserves fingered fronts, creating a stable substrate for dynamics. On this representation, we develop Morpher, an autoregressive forecasting network with a ``Morphon'' memory that links local curvature to long-range temporal dependencies. Morpher outperforms leading video-prediction models in maintaining front localization and anisotropic branching, and modest segmentation improvements yield noticeably more stable forecasts. Ablations across sequence models, inference strategies and observation ratios show that attention-based architectures with structural memory best preserve dense-finger propagation. By uniting geometry-aware segmentation with morphology-level forecasting, this framework turns swarming expansion into a predictive dynamical system, enabling quantitative interrogation and potential control of microbial collectives during mucosal repair and gut ecosystem engineering.

Title: Anisotropic electron gas in a hyperbolic van der Waals material
Authors: Nicola Melchioni, Andrea Mancini, Antonio Ambrosio
Abstract: Electron gases in low dimensional materials exhibit unconventional transport and optical phenomena due to reduced phase space, enhanced interactions, and strong sensitivity to lattice symmetry. While commonly realized in quantum confined systems and engineered heterostructures, such states are rare in naturally occurring materials. Hyperbolic materials provide a compelling alternative, as extreme lattice anisotropy can host unconventional electronic states and novel electron-phonon interactions. Here, we investigate the angle resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) response of MoOCl2, the first naturally occurring hyperbolic material whose hyperbolicity originates from a highly anisotropic electron gas. We observe pronounced polarization dependent Fano line shapes, revealing coherent coupling between phonons and an anisotropic electronic continuum. We characterize the directional response of this continuum, incorporating it into effective Raman tensors that quantitatively reproduce the ARPR measurements and capture the distinct Raman fingerprint of MoOCl2. Excitation energy and thickness dependent ARPR measurements further demonstrate a tunable quasi 1D electronic continuum with weak interlayer coupling, establishing MoOCl2 as a model system for Raman studies of electron-phonon coupling in hyperbolic materials

Title: Robust Machine Learning Framework for Reliable Discovery of High-Performance Half-Heusler Thermoelectrics
Authors: Shoeb Athar, Adrien Mecibah, Philippe Jund
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) can facilitate efficient thermoelectric (TE) material discovery essential to address the environmental crisis. However, ML models often suffer from poor experimental generalizability despite high metrics. This study presents a robust workflow, applied to the half-Heusler (hH) structural prototype, for figure of merit (zT) prediction, to improve the generalizability of ML models. To resolve challenges in dataset handling and feature filtering, we first introduce a rigorous PCA-based splitting method that ensures training and test sets are unbiased and representative of the full chemical space. We then integrate Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with k-best feature filtering across three architectures-Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks - while employing SISSO symbolic regression for physical insight and comparison. Using SHAP and SISSO analysis, we identify A-site dopant concentration (xA'), and A-site Heat of Vaporization (HVA) as the primary drivers of zT besides Temperature (T). Finally, a high-throughput screening of approximately 6.6x10^8 potential compositions, filtered by stability constraints, yielded several novel high-zT candidates. Breaking from the traditional focus of improving test RMSE/R^2 values of the models, this work shifts the attention on establishing the test set a true proxy for model generalizability and strengthening the often neglected modules of the existing ML workflows for the data-driven design of next-generation thermoelectric materials.

Title: AI Meets Plasticity: A Comprehensive Survey
Authors: Hadi Bakhshan, Sima Farshbaf, Junior Ramirez Machado, Fernando Rastellini Canela, Josep Maria Carbonell
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly emerging as a new paradigm of scientific discovery, namely data-driven science, across nearly all scientific disciplines. In materials science and engineering, AI has already begun to exert a transformative influence, making it both timely and necessary to examine its interaction with materials plasticity. In this study, we present a holistic survey of the convergence between AI and plasticity, highlighting state-of-the-art AI methodologies employed to discover, construct surrogate models for, and emulate the plastic behavior of materials. From a materials science perspective, we examine cause-and-effect relationships governing plastic deformation, including microstructural characterization and macroscopic responses described through plasticity constitutive models. From the perspective of AI methodology, we review a broad spectrum of applied approaches, ranging from frequentist techniques such as classical machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and physics-informed models to probabilistic frameworks that incorporate uncertainty quantification and generative AI methods. These data-driven approaches are discussed in the context of materials characterization and plasticity-related applications. The primary objective of this survey is to develop a comprehensive and well-organized taxonomy grounded in AI methodologies, with particular emphasis on distinguishing critical aspects of these techniques, including model architectures, data requirements, and predictive performance within the specific domain of materials plasticity. By doing so, this work aims to provide a clear road map for researchers and practitioners in the materials community, while offering deeper physical insight and intuition into the role of AI in advancing materials plasticity and characterization, an area of growing importance in the emerging AI-driven era.

Title: Topological Quantum Criticality in Quasiperiodic Ising Chain
Authors: Sheng Yang, Hai-Qing Lin, Xue-Jia Yu
Abstract: Topological classifications of quantum critical systems have recently attracted growing interest, as they go beyond the traditional paradigms of condensed matter and statistical physics. However, such classifications remain largely unexplored at critical points in aperiodic environments, particularly under quasiperiodic modulations. In this Letter, we uncover a novel class of topological quasiperiodic fixed points that are intermediate between the clean and infinite-randomness limits. By exactly solving the quasiperiodic cluster-Ising chain, we unambiguously demonstrate that all phase boundaries separating quasiperiodically modulated phases are governed by a new family of topological Ising-like fixed points unique to strongly modulated quasiperiodic systems: Despite exhibiting indistinguishable bulk critical properties, these fixed points host robust topological edge degeneracies and are therefore topologically distinct from previously recognized quasiperiodic universality classes, as further supported by complementary lattice simulations.

Title: Geometry-driven splitting dynamics of a triply quantized vortex in a ring-shaped condensate
Authors: Sixun Jia, Xin Wang, Xiaofeng Wu, Shuhang Wang, Bo Zhang, Bo Xiong
Abstract: We study the splitting dynamics of a triply quantized vortex (TQV) confined in a ring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate under a weakly elliptical harmonic trap. Using full 3D simulations in cylindrical coordinates, combined with a semi-analytical energy analysis, we show that the vortex preferentially splits along the long axis of the trap, a direction that minimizes the kinetic-energy cost relative to the initial TQV state. Systematic parameter scans reveal that initial quantum fluctuations increase the splitting time and suppress the transient three-core pattern observed in noise-free simulations, whereas stronger nonlinear interactions accelerate the splitting. When the trap is nearly isotropic, the unstable Bogoliubov modes are dominated by both azimuthal quantum number $l_q=3$ and $l_q=2$; this leads to a dynamical sequence where three daughter vortices first form a triangular arrangement, later evolving into a linear chain. For stronger anisotropy, geometric coupling selectively enhances the $l_q=2$ mode, making it the sole dominant channel and resulting directly in linear vortex alignment -- a clear signature of geometry-induced mode competition explained through combined energy-based and Bogoliubov stability analysis. Our results provide a quantitative picture of how trap geometry can steer the instability pathway, splitting time, and final pattern of a multiply quantized vortex, offering a route toward geometry-controlled vortex engineering.

Title: Novel dynamical excitations and roton-based measurement of Cooper-pair momentum in a two-dimensional Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superfluid on optical lattices
Authors: Shuning Tan, Jiayi Shi, Peng Zou, Tianxing Ma, Huaisong Zhao
Abstract: Determining the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of Cooper pairs in unconventional superconductors or superfluids is a topic of great interest in condensed matter physics and ultracold atomic gases. Theoretically, we investigate the dynamical excitations of a two-dimensional spin-polarized attractive Hubbard model on a square optical lattice under an effective Zeeman field by computing the density and spin dynamical structure factors, focusing on phase transition from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid to an Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluid. In the FFLO superfluid, besides the phonon mode in the density channel, a low-energy bogolon mode emerges in the spin channel, which is associated with Bogoliubov quasiparticles on a Bogoliubov Fermi surface. Moreover, the dynamical excitations exhibit pronounced anisotropy in momentum space due to the finite COM momentum. At half filling, the roton mode around $[\pi,\pi]$ evolves from a point-like minimum into a ring structure shifted by the COM momentum across the BCS-FFLO transition, providing a roton-based protocol to extract the COM momentum. These predictions provide key insights for confirming the existence of FFLO superfluids and understanding their dynamical excitation spectra.

Title: Magnetic, transport and electronic properties of Ni$_2$FeAl Heusler alloy nanoparticles: Experimental and theoretical investigation
Authors: Priyanka Yadav, Mohd Zeeshan, Brajesh K. Mani, Rajendra S. Dhaka
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of structural, magnetic and transport properties of Ni$_2$FeAl Heusler alloy nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized via template-less chemical route. The NPs exhibit high saturation magnetization of 3.02 $\mu_ {\rm B}$/f.u. at 5~K, large magnetic anisotropy of 0.238 MJ/m$^3$, and a Curie temperature of 874~K. Magnetocaloric analysis reveals a magnetic entropy change of 3.1 this http URL$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 70 kOe. Low-temperature transport measurements show a weak resistivity upturn, following a $-T^{1/2}$ dependence, indicative of disorder-enhanced electron-electron interactions. First-principles calculations based on density functional theory yield a magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy of 0.987 MJ/m$^3$, consistent with experiment and demonstrate pronounced surface and finite-size effects through comparison of bulk and nanocluster geometries. The combination of high Curie temperature, sizable perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and moderate spin polarization and magnetic entropy change make the Ni$_2$FeAl as promising candidate for various applications.

Title: Quantum Metric Length as a Fundamental Length Scale in Disordered Flat Band Materials
Authors: Chun Wang Chau, Tian Xiang, Shuai A. Chen, K. T. Law
Abstract: Our previous understanding of electronic transport in disordered systems was based on the assumption that there is a finite Fermi velocity for the relevant electrons. The Fermi velocity determines important length scales in disordered systems such as the diffusion length and the localization length. However, in disordered systems with vanishing or nearly vanishing Fermi velocity, it is uncertain what determines the important length scales in such systems. In this work, we use the 1D Lieb lattice with isolated flat bands as an example to show that the quantum metric length (QML) is a fundamental length scale in the ballistic, diffusive and localization regimes. The QML is defined through the Bloch state wave functions of the flat bands. In the ballistic regime with short junctions, the QML controls the finite energy transport properties. In the localization regime with long junctions, the localization length is determined by the QML and remarkably, independent of disorder strength over a wide range of disorder strength. We call this unconventional localization regime, the quantum metric localization regime. In the diffusive regime, we demonstrate that the diffusion coefficient is linearly proportional to the QML via the wave-packet dynamics numerically. Importantly, the numerical results are consistent with the analytical results obtained through the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We conclude that the QML is a fundamentally important length scale governing the properties of disordered flat band materials.

Title: Towards knowledge-based workflows: a semantic approach to atomistic simulations for mechanical and thermodynamic properties
Authors: Abril Azocar Guzman, Hoang-Thien Luu, Sarath Menon, Tilmann Hickel, Nina Merkert, Stefan Sandfeld
Abstract: Mechanical and thermodynamic properties, including the influence of crystal defects, are critical for evaluating materials in engineering applications. Molecular dynamics simulations provide valuable insight into these mechanisms at the atomic scale. However, current practice often relies on fragmented scripts with inconsistent metadata and limited provenance, which hinders reproducibility, interoperability, and reuse. FAIR data principles and workflow-based approaches offer a path to address these limitations. We present reusable atomistic workflows that incorporate metadata annotation aligned with application ontologies, enabling automatic provenance capture and FAIR-compliant data outputs. The workflows cover key mechanical and thermodynamic quantities, including equation of state, elastic tensors, mechanical loading, thermal properties, defect formation energies, and nanoindentation. We demonstrate validation of structure-property relations such as the Hall-Petch effect and show that the workflows can be reused across different interatomic potentials and materials within a coherent semantic framework. The approach provides AI-ready simulation data, supports emerging agentic AI workflows, and establishes a generalizable blueprint for knowledge-based mechanical and thermodynamic simulations.

Title: Superstable Geometry in Triadic Percolation
Authors: Fatemeh Aghaei, Abbas Ali Saberi, Holger Kantz, Juergen Kurths
Abstract: Triadic percolation turns bond percolation into a dynamical problem governed by an effective one-dimensional unimodal map. We show that the geometry of superstable cycles provides a direct, map-agnostic probe of local nonlinearity: specifically, the distance from the map's maximum to a distinguished next-to-maximum point on the attracting $2^n$-cycle (which coincides with a preimage of the maximum at $2^n$-superstability) scales as $|\Delta p|^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma = 1/z$, where $z$ is the nonflat order of the maximum. This prediction is verified across canonical unimodal families and heterogeneous triadic ensembles, with Lyapunov spectra corroborating the one-dimensional reduction. A derivative condition on the activation kernel fixes the local nonlinearity order $z$ (and thus, under standard unimodal-map hypotheses, the associated $z$-logistic universality class) and gives conditions under which $z>2$ can be realized. The diagnostic operates directly on orbit data under standard regularity assumptions, providing a practical tool to classify universality in higher-order networks.

Title: Inferring Concepts from Noisy Examples in Hopfield-like Neural Networks
Authors: Marco Benedetti, Giulia Fischetti, Enzo Marinari, Gleb Oshanin, Victor Dotsenko
Abstract: We study a variant of the pseudo-inverse learning rule for Hopfield-like Neural Networks, which allows the network to infer archetypal concepts on the basis of a limited number of examples. The mean-field replica theory for this model reveals how this generalization ability is mediated by a multitude of states, with diverse thermodynamic properties, coexisting with the standard Hopfield ones. They appear and vanish through smooth transitions or discontinuous jumps and, interestingly, show much stronger Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) effects than the standard Hopfield model, as captured by our 1RSB analysis. Our results, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, provide deeper insight into the interplay between memory storage and generalization in attractor neural networks.

Abstract: Self-accelerating Airy matter waves offer a clean setting to access the cubic Kennard phase. Here we reconstruct the relative phase of simulated Airy-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates in free space, a regime approached in microgravity, from interference fringes. The cubic phase dynamics are quantified via windowed polynomial fits with systematics-aware uncertainty estimates that account for window-induced correlations. We compare two experimentally feasible phase-extraction methods - heterodyne-based and density-based - and show that an Airy-Gaussian geometry yields substantially improved robustness to fit-window selection relative to an Airy-Airy collision. In the weakly interacting regime, the extracted cubic coefficient responds linearly to the effective one-dimensional interaction strength. Our approach turns cubic phase dynamics into a practical probe of weak mean-field nonlinearities in self-accelerating condensates.

Title: Correlated and anti-correlated density dependent motility
Authors: Itay Azizi
Abstract: I study via Langevin dynamics simulations two opposite cases of systems of particles that alternate their identity according to density dependent motility (DDM) rules and interact via a soft repulsive potential. In the correlated case, dilute regions are passive and dense regions are active, while in the anti-correlated case, dilute regions are active and dense regions are passive. I classify the emerging steady states, explain the principal phase transitions, and finally suggest directions for further investigation.

Title: Reshaping Global Loop Structure to Accelerate Local Optimization by Smoothing Rugged Landscapes
Authors: Timothee Leleu, Sam Reifenstein, Atsushi Yamamura, Surya Ganguli
Abstract: Probabilistic graphical models with frustration exhibit rugged energy landscapes that trap iterative optimization dynamics. These landscapes are shaped not only by local interactions, but crucially also by the global loop structure of the graph. The famous Bethe approximation treats the graph as a tree, effectively ignoring global structure, thereby limiting its effectiveness for optimization. Loop expansions capture such global structure in principle, but are often impractical due to combinatorial explosion. The $M$-layer construction provides an alternative: make $M$ copies of the graph and reconnect edges between them uniformly at random. This provides a controlled sequence of approximations from the original graph at $M=1$, to the Bethe approximation as $M \rightarrow \infty$. Here we generalize this construction by replacing uniform random rewiring with a structured mixing kernel $Q$ that sets the probability that any two layers are interconnected. As a result, the global loop structure can be shaped without modifying local interactions. We show that, after this copy-and-reconnect transformation, there exists a regime in which layer-to-layer fluctuations decay, increasing the probability of reaching the global minimum of the energy function of the original graph. This yields a highly general and practical tool for optimization. Using this approach, the computational cost required to reach these optimal solutions is reduced across sparse and dense Ising benchmarks, including spin glasses and planted instances. When combined with replica-exchange Monte Carlo, the same construction increases the polynomial-time algorithmic threshold for the maximum independent set problem. A cavity analysis shows that structured inter-layer coupling significantly smooths rugged energy landscapes by collapsing configurational complexity and suppressing many suboptimal metastable states.

Title: Spin Relaxometry with Solid-State Defects: Theory, Platforms, and Applications
Authors: Ruotian Gong, Alex L. Melendez, Guanghui He, Zhongyuan Liu, Chong Zu, Huan Zhao
Abstract: Spin relaxometry using solid-state spin defects, such as the diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, probes dynamical processes by measuring how environmental fluctuations enhance the spin relaxation rate. In the weak-coupling limit, relaxation rates sample the transverse magnetic-noise power spectral density through a sensor-specific filter function, turning the defect into a local, frequency-selective noise spectrometer. This review bridges theory and experiment, clarifying how measured relaxation rates map onto noise spectra and how near-field geometry shapes the response. We highlight representative applications across condensed-matter physics, chemical and biological sensing, and relaxometry-based magnetic-resonance spectroscopy. We conclude with emerging opportunities and key challenges.

Title: Freezing-Melting Mediated Dewetting Transition for Droplets on Superhydrophobic Surfaces with Condensation
Authors: Jiawang Cui, Tianyou Wang, Zhizhao Che
Abstract: The water-repellence properties of superhydrophobic surfaces make them promising for many applications. However, in some extreme environments, such as high humidities and low temperatures, condensation on the surface is inevitable, which induces the loss of surface superhydrophobicity. In this study, we propose a freezing-melting strategy to achieve the dewetting transition from the Wenzel state to the Cassie-Baxter state. It requires freezing the droplet by reducing the substrate temperature and then melting the droplet by heating the substrate. The condensation-induced wetting transition from the Cassie-Baxter state to the Wenzel state is analyzed first. Two kinds of superhydrophobic surfaces, i.e., single-scale nano-structured superhydrophobic surface and hierarchical-scale micro-nano-structured superhydrophobic surface, are compared and their effects on the static contact states and impact processes of droplets are analyzed. The mechanism for the dewetting transition is analyzed by exploring the differences in the micro/nano-structures of the surfaces and it is attributed to the unique structure and strength of the superhydrophobic surface. These findings will enrich our understanding of the droplet-surface interaction involving phase changes and have great application prospects for the design of superhydrophobic surfaces.

Title: Excitations and anisotropic sound in planar dipolar supersolids with tilted dipoles
Authors: Reuben Cook, Au-Chen Lee, P. Blair Blakie
Abstract: We investigate the collective excitations of anisotropic dipolar supersolids in planar confinement, focusing on triangular and stripe phases in situations where the dipoles are titled to have a component in the plane. Using Bogoliubov-de Gennes calculations and hydrodynamic theory, we identify the elastic parameters that govern the long-wavelength dynamics, including two orientational coefficients that capture the broken rotational symmetry induced by dipole tilt. Analytical expressions for the speeds of sound are obtained along the principal axes for triangular supersolids and along any propagation direction for the stripe supersolid. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding sound propagation in anisotropic dipolar supersolids and establish connections to recent experiments on sound propagation in striped Bose-Einstein condensates.

Title: Steady-state skin effect in bosonic topological edge states under parametric driving
Authors: Nobuyuki Okuma
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have attracted significant theoretical interest due to their extreme properties. However, realizations have mostly been limited to classical applications or artificial setups. In this study, we focus on the quantum nature inherent in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) systems, which from the perspective of spectral theory corresponds to non-Hermiticity. Based on this insight, we propose a steady-state skin effect in quantum condensed matter utilizing such BdG non-Hermiticity. Specifically, we introduce BdG quantum terms arising from parametric pumping to the edge states of an underlying bosonic Hermitian Chern insulator, thereby realizing non-Hermiticity without dissipation. This system design has the advantage of being largely independent of microscopic model details. Through analysis using non-equilibrium Green's functions, we find that under open boundary conditions, a steady state exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect is realized. The pronounced corner particle accumulation observed in this steady state shows quadrature anisotropy, which manifests the bosonic quantum nature. Our results bridge the gap between the fascinating mathematics of non-Hermitian matrices and practical quantum physical systems.

Title: Depth and slip ratio dependencies of friction for a sphere rolling on a granular slope
Authors: Takeshi Fukumoto, Hiroyuki Ebata, Ishan Sharma, Hiroaki Katsuragi
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the dynamics of a sphere rolling down a granular slope by varying the initial velocity, slope angle, and sphere density. The results show that the sphere rolls down with constant deceleration while sinking into the granular bed. $\delta/R$ (the sinking depth $\delta$ normalized to the sphere radius $R$) is scaled by the sphere density normalized by the bulk density of the granular layer. To evaluate the translational energy dissipation, we introduce an effective friction coefficient $\mu_\mathrm{d}$. We demonstrate that $\mu_\mathrm{d}$ decreases with increasing the slope angle and the slip ratio. Furthermore, systematic measurements over a wide range of sphere densities reveal that $\mu_\mathrm{d}$ increases linearly with $\delta/R$ : $\mu_\mathrm{d}=\beta(\delta/R)+\mu_0$. The value of $\mu_0$ is linearly decreasing with slip ratio and its coefficient $\beta(\simeq0.41)$ does not vary significantly. The results suggest that the normalized depth and slip ratio determine the effective friction of a rolling sphere.

Title: Ferromagnetic Ferroelectricity due to Orbital Ordering
Authors: I. V. Solovyev
Abstract: Realization of ferromagnetic ferroelectricity, combining two ferroic orders in a single phase, is the longstanding problem of great practical importance. One of the difficulties is that ferromagnetism alone cannot break inversion symmetry $\mathcal{I}$. Therefore, such a phase cannon be obtained by purely magnetic means. Here, we show how it can be designed by making orbital degrees of freedom active. The idea can be traced back to a basic principle of interatomic exchange, which states that an alternation of occupied orbitals along a bond (i.e., antiferro orbital order) favors ferromagnetic coupling. Moreover, the antiferro orbital order breaks $\mathcal{I}$, so that the bond becomes not simply ferromagnetic but also ferroelectric. Then, we formulate main principles governing the realization of such a state in solids, namely: (i) The magnetic atoms should not be located in inversion centers, as in the honeycomb lattice; (ii) The orbitals should be flexible enough to adjust they shape and minimize the energy of exchange interactions; (iii) This flexibility can be achieved by intraatomic interactions, which are responsible for Hund's second rule and compete with the crystal field splitting; (iv) For octahedrally coordinated transition-metal compounds, the most promising candidates appear to be iodides with a $d^{2}$ configuration and relatively weak $d$-$p$ hybridization. Such a situation is realized in the van der Walls compound VI$_3$, which we expect to be ferromagnetic ferroelectric.

Title: Degenerate Soft Modes and Selective Condensation in BaAl$_2$O$_4$ via Inelastic X-ray Scattering
Authors: Yui Ishii, Arisa Yamamoto, Alfred Q. R. Baron, Hiroshi Uchiyama, Naoki Sato
Abstract: BaAl$_2$O$_4$ is a ferroelectric material that exhibits structural quantum criticality through chemical composition tuning. Although theoretical calculations and several diffraction experiments have suggested the involvement of a soft mode in its ferroelectric structural phase transition, direct experimental verification is still lacking. In this study, we successfully observed two soft modes of BaAl$_2$O$_4$ using x-ray inelastic scattering, providing direct experimental evidence for their role in the structural phase transition. Furthermore, we reveal that the soft modes at the M and K points are nearly degenerate in energy, indicating a delicate balance in which either mode could potentially freeze. The K-point mode simultaneously softens toward the transition temperature ($T_{\rm C}$) in a manner nearly identical to the M-point mode. However, the phase transition condenses only at the M point, with the M-point mode stabilizing as an acoustic mode in the low-temperature structure and the K-point mode hardening as temperature decreases.

Title: A Three-State Thermodynamically Consistent Cross-Bridge Model for Muscle Contraction
Authors: Yiwei Wang, Chun Liu
Abstract: Muscle contraction is a prototypical multiscale chemomechanical process in which ATP hydrolysis at the molecular level drives force generation and mechanical work at larger scales. A long-standing challenge is to connect microscopic cross-bridge dynamics to macroscopic observables while retaining an explicit, thermodynamically consistent energetic budget for chemical-to-mechanical transduction. Here we use the Energetic Variational Approach (EnVarA) to unify Hill's cycle-affinity viewpoint with Huxley's sliding-filament mechanics within a single thermodynamically closed framework. We formulate a three-state Fokker--Planck-jump description for cross-bridge populations evolving on state-dependent free-energy landscapes, in which ATP hydrolysis enters through local detailed balance and biases the transition rates. Filament sliding velocity is incorporated as a convective transport mechanism in the Fokker--Planck dynamics, so that mechanical power exchange with the external motion emerges transparently from the resulting energy-dissipation law together with chemical input and irreversible dissipation. Under chemostatted conditions and a fast-equilibration closure for the attached substates, the model reduces to a closed two-state molecular motor description; in a further singular limit, this reduction recovers a Huxley-type transport-reaction equation. Proof-of-concept simulations of the reduced model reproduce a Hill-like force-velocity relation and show how ATP availability modulates the force-velocity curve while preserving its characteristic Hill-type shape.

Title: Rheologically tuned diffusion modulates quorum sensing in Vibrio fischeri
Authors: Chunhe Li, Zixiang Lin, Hongyi Bian, Anqi Li, Yu Cheng, Honyi Xin, Zijie Qu
Abstract: Understanding how the physical properties of a fluid influence bacterial behavior is essential for explaining how microorganisms interact with their environment and with animal hosts. Here, we examine how changes in fluid viscosity and rheological properties affect the locomotion of the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri and its ability to produce luminescence through cell--cell communication. We track the three-dimensional motion of single cells in well-defined fluids with different physical properties and measure the luminescence emitted by cell populations. We find that fluids with higher viscosity cause V. fischeri to spend more time in a slower, turning-focused swimming mode, which reduces how effectively cells spread out and encounter the chemical signals required to activate luminescence. As a result, luminescence first increases and then decreases in Newtonian fluids, but decreases monotonically in fluids that exhibit non-Newtonian rheological behavior. Computer simulations based on our measurements confirm that the ability of cells to explore their surroundings plays a central role in determining when and how strongly they communicate. These findings reveal a direct link between the physical environment, bacterial movement, and collective behavior, and offer new insight into how microorganisms adapt to complex fluid habitats, including those found inside animal hosts.

Title: Morphological Evolution of Nickel-Fullerene Thin Film Mixtures
Authors: Giovanni Ceccio, Kazumasa Takahashi, Romana Miksova, Yuto Kondo, Eva Stepanovska, Josef Novak, Sebastiano Vasi, Jiri Vacik
Abstract: Hybrid systems consisting of metal-fullerene composites exhibit intriguing properties but often suffer from thermal instability. With proper control, such instability can be harnessed to enable the formation of sophisticated nanostructures with nanometric precision. These self-organization phenomena are not limited to thermal stimulation alone but can also be triggered by other external stimuli. In this work, we investigate the morphological evolution of thin films composed of evaporated C60 and sputtered nickel mixtures, focusing on how external stimuli influence both their structural and electrical properties. Thin films were prepared under controlled deposition conditions, and their surface morphology was analyzed using advanced characterization techniques. Progressive changes in film morphology were observed as a function of composition and external treatment, highlighting the interplay between metallic and molecular components. In particular, it was observed that, due to the annealing treatment, the sample undergoes strong phase separation, with the formation of structures tens of microns in diameter and an increase in electrical resistance, exhibiting insulating behavior. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms governing hybrid thin film formation and suggest potential applications in electronic, optoelectronic, and energy-related devices.

Title: Facilitating electrical and laser-induced skyrmion nucleation with a dipolar-field enhanced effective DMI
Authors: Mark C. H. de Jong, Dinar Khusyainov, Julian Hintermayr, Bart Sanders, Dmitry Kozodaev, Aleksei V. Kimel, Bert Koopmans, Theo H. M. Rasing, Reinoud Lavrijsen
Abstract: We demonstrate experimentally how the nucleation of skyrmions in an Ir, Co, and Pt based magnetic multilayer is affected by introducing a layer dependent sign for the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In one stack, the bottom half of the stack is given a positive DMI and the top half a negative DMI, and as a result, the in-plane component of the dipolar field is aligned parallel to the effective field of the DMI in every layer, enhancing the effective DMI. We show that this enhanced DMI facilitates the nucleation and stability of skyrmions using both current-driven and laser-induced skyrmion nucleation. In the devices with an enhanced effective DMI, the density of nucleated skyrmions is greater by up to a factor 20 and skyrmions can be observed in stronger magnetic fields - suggesting that their stability is also improved. These results show that skyrmion nucleation depends strongly on the magnitude of the effective DMI in a magnetic multilayer and that the dipolar field within such a multilayer presents an effective route towards controlling the effective DMI, and thereby, the nucleation of chiral magnetic textures.

Title: Weyl-Dirac nodal line phonons with type-selective surface states
Authors: Le Du, Zeling Li, Jiabing Chen, Dongliang Mao, Lei Wang, Xiao-Ping Li
Abstract: The band complex formed by multiple topological states has attracted extensive attention for the emergent properties produced by the interplay among the constituent states. Here, based on group theory analysis, we present a scheme for rapidly identifying the Weyl-Dirac nodal lines (a complex of Weyl and Dirac nodal lines) in bosonic systems. We find only 5 of the 230 space groups host Weyl-Dirac nodal line phonons. Notably, the Dirac nodal line resides along the high-symmetry line, whereas the Weyl nodal line is distributed on the high-symmetry plane and is interconnected with the Dirac nodal line, jointly forming a composite nodal network structure. Unlike traditional nodal nets, this nodal network exhibits markedly distinct surface states on different surfaces, which can be attributed to the fundamental differences in the topological properties between the Weyl and Dirac nodal lines. This unique property thus allows the material to present distinct surface states in a termination-selective manner. Furthermore, by first-principles calculations, we identify the materials NdRhO$_{3}$ and ZnSe$_{2}$O$_{5}$ as candidate examples to elaborate the Weyl-Dirac nodal line and their related topological features. Our work provides an insight for exploring and leveraging topological properties in systems with coexisting multiple topological states.

Title: Bayesian Parameter Estimation for Predictive Modeling of Illumination-Dependent Current-Voltage Curves
Authors: Eunchi Kim, Thomas Kirchartz
Abstract: Machine learning enables rapid estimation of material parameters in solar cells via neural-network-based surrogate models. However, the reliability of extracted parameters depends on underlying assumptions such as the choice of one-dimensional drift-diffusion model and selection of free material parameters. To validate the inferred parameters, we perform predictive modeling of light-intensity-dependent current-voltage (JV) characteristics. Well-known physical effects, including the influence of external resistance and recombination dynamics on illumination-dependent device performance, are reflected in parameter estimation and prediction workflow. We show that correct treatment of dark shunt resistance and emphasizing shifted current (J + Jsc) during fitting enhances prediction accuracy at low to intermediate illumination level. Additionally, we analyze the information content of various input JV curve combinations, demonstrating that including at least one illuminated JV, preferably not under high illumination due to series resistance effects, is critical for reliable parameter estimation and device performance prediction.

Title: Quantum vortex channels as Josephson junctions
Authors: Natalia Masalaeva, Wyatt Kirkby, Francesca Ferlaino, Russell N. Bisset
Abstract: In quantum gases, weak links are typically realized with externally imposed optical potentials. We show that, in rotating binary condensates, quantized vortices in one component form hollow channels that act as self-induced weak links for the other, enabling superflow through otherwise impenetrable, phase-separated domains. This introduces a novel barrier mechanism: quantum pressure creates an effective barrier inside the vortex channel, set by the constriction width, which controls the superflow. Tuning the interspecies interaction strength drives a crossover from the hydrodynamic transport to Josephson tunneling regime. Long-range dipolar interactions further tune the weak-link properties, enabling both short links and two coupled junctions in series. Circuit models quantitatively capture the dc current-phase relations for both configurations. These results establish vortices as reconfigurable, interaction-controlled Josephson elements in superfluids.

Title: Thermophysical properties of spark plasma sintered UCo: a comparison with machine learning predictions
Authors: Yifan Sun, Hironobu Nakamura, Masaya Kumagai, Yuji Ohishi, Ken Kurosaki
Abstract: Uranium dioxide has been widely used as a nuclear fuel in commercial light water reactors due to its high uranium density and chemical stability. However, its relatively low thermal conductivity is not optimal from the viewpoints of fuel integrity and safety margins, particularly during loss-of-coolant accidents. Although the development of accident-tolerant fuels with higher thermal conductivity is strongly desired, many potential uranium compounds remain unexplored due to constraints associated with handling radioactive materials. To efficiently screen promising uranium compounds with high thermal conductivity, past studies have leveraged machine-learning models to accelerate the discovery process. In this study, we experimentally examine the model's predictions by fabricating UCo and measuring its high-temperature thermophysical properties. Our results show that the thermal conductivity of UCo predicted by machine learning is in good agreement with the experimental measurements. Despite slight discrepancies, additional SHAP analysis suggests that the model's decision logic is consistent with known physical trends. Overall, this study fills a gap in reported thermophysical properties of UCo and provides experimental support for machine-learning-assisted screening of uranium compounds relevant to advanced fuel development.

Title: Internal Trajectories and Observation Effects in Langevin Splitting Schemes
Authors: Bettina G. Keller
Abstract: Langevin integrators based on operator splitting are widely used in molecular dynamics. This work examines Langevin splitting schemes from the perspective of their internal trajectories and observation points, complementing existing generator-based analyses. By exploiting merging, splitting, and cyclic permutation of elementary update operators, formally distinct schemes can be grouped according to identical or closely related trajectories. Accuracy differences arising from momentum updates and observation points are quantified for configurational sampling, free-energy estimates, and transition rates. While modern Langevin integrators are remarkably stable under standard simulation conditions, subtle but systematic biases emerge at large friction coefficients and time steps. These results clarify when accuracy differences between splitting schemes matter in practice and provide an intuitive framework for understanding observation effects.

Title: Fe-DCA Metal-Organic Frameworks on the Bi2Se3(0001) Topological Insulator Surface
Authors: Anna Kurowská, Jakub Planer, Pavel Procházka, Veronika Stará, Elena Vaníčková, Zdeněk Endstrasser, Matthias Blatnik, Čestmír Drašar, Jan Čechal
Abstract: The formation of two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on an inert surface of a topological insulator (TI) is a pathway to engineer quantum materials with exotic properties. MOFs featuring ferromagnetically coupled metal atoms are theoretically predicted to induce an exchange gap in the TI surface band structure, potentially leading to a quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, achieving ordered MOFs on TI surfaces remains challenging due to the limited knowledge of self-assembly on these substrates. In this paper, we demonstrate self-assembly of Fe atoms and dicyanoanthracene (DCA) molecules into 2D MOFs on the Bi2Se3(0001) surface at room temperature, investigated via a combination of low-energy electron microscopy and diffraction (LEEM/LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and ab initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Two competing Fe-DCA phases form. The first phase corresponds to a close-packed Fe1DCA3 structure. In contrast, the second phase exhibits a larger unit cell with no match to either known or DFT-calculated systems, indicating a more complex bonding environment. These findings advance the understanding of the growth of MOFs on a strong topological insulator surface and provide insights for designing MOFs/TI interfaces with tailored electronic and magnetic properties.

Title: FluxNet: Learning Capacity-Constrained Local Transport Operators for Conservative and Bounded PDE Surrogates
Authors: Zishuo Lan, Junjie Li, Lei Wang, Jincheng Wang
Abstract: Autoregressive learning of time-stepping operators offers an effective approach to data-driven PDE simulation on grids. For conservation laws, however, long-horizon rollouts are often destabilized when learned updates violate global conservation and, in many applications, additional state bounds such as nonnegative mass and densities or concentrations constrained to [0,1]. Enforcing these coupled constraints via direct next-state regression remains difficult. We introduce a framework for learning conservative transport operators on regular grids, inspired by lattice Boltzmann-style discrete-velocity transport representations. Instead of predicting the next state, the model outputs local transport operators that update cells through neighborhood exchanges, guaranteeing discrete conservation by construction. For bounded quantities, we parameterize transport within a capacity-constrained feasible set, enforcing bounds structurally rather than by post-hoc clipping. We validate FluxNet on 1D convection-diffusion, 2D shallow water equations, 1D traffic flow, and 2D spinodal decomposition. Experiments on shallow-water equations and traffic flow show improved rollout stability and physical consistency over strong baselines. On phase-field spinodal decomposition, the method enables large time-steps with long-range transport, accelerating simulation while preserving microstructure evolution in both pointwise and statistical measures.

Title: Strong Correlations in the Dynamical Evolution of Lowest Landau Level Bosons
Authors: Yuchen Yang, Nigel R. Cooper
Abstract: Recent experiments with rotating Bose gases have demonstrated the interaction-driven hydrodynamic instability of an initial extended strip-like state in the lowest Landau level. We investigate this phenomenon in the low density limit, where the mean-field Gross--Pitaevskii theory becomes inadequate, using exact diagonalisation studies and analytic arguments. We show that the behaviour can be understood in terms of weakly-interacting repulsively-bound few-body clusters. Signatures of cluster behaviour are observed in the expectation values of observables which oscillate at frequencies characterised by the energies of few-body boundstates. Using a semiclassical theory for interacting clusters, we predict the long-time growth of the cloud width to be a power law in the logarithm of time. This slow thermalisation of bound clusters represents a form of quantum many-body scars.

Title: Optical properties of Fermi polarons in a GaInP/MoSe2 monolayer heterostructure

Mulkerin, Jesper Levinsen, Francesca Maria Marchetti, Meera M. Parish, Niklas Nilius, Christian Schneider, Sven Höfling
Abstract: Engineering optical properties, such as luminescence purity and charge transfer, is crucial for harnessing the application potential of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). While electrostatic gating is widely applied to gain charge control in TMDC monolayers, charge transfer can also be engineered via coupling of TMDC monolayers at semiconductor III/V, organic, or van der Waals interfaces. This confers great advantages, such as ease in implementation and compatibility in device integration. Here, we shed light on the optical properties of many-particle complexes emerging at the GaInP/MoSe2 interface as a highly relevant material combination to manipulate the optical properties of TMDCs in integrated photonic devices. Our study verifies its nature as a type II hetero-interface, which bears the feasibility to display disorder-free photoluminescence. Through optical absorption measurements, we verify that the charged complexes acquire substantial oscillator strength. Furthermore, temperature-dependent photoluminescence, supported by a microscopic theory framework, evidences the suppression of the characteristic carrier recoil effect that was previously observed in the photoluminescence of trions in TMDCs. These phenomena allow us to identify the optical signatures at the TMDC-GaInP interface as Fermi polaron quasiparticle resonances, which are of high importance in researching Bose-Fermi mixtures in condensed matter systems.

Title: Putting machine learning to the test in a quantum many-body system
Authors: Yilun Gao, Alberto Rodríguez, Rudolf A. Römer
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems pose a formidable computational challenge due to the exponential growth of their Hilbert space. While machine learning (ML) has shown promise as an alternative paradigm, most applications remain at the proof-of-concept stage, focusing narrowly on energy estimation at the lower end of the spectrum. Here, we push ML beyond this frontier by extensively testing HubbardNet, a deep neural network architecture for the Bose-Hubbard model. Pushing improvements in the optimizer and learning rates, and introducing physics-informed output activations that can resolve extremely small wave-function amplitudes, we achieve ground-state energy errors reduced by orders of magnitude and wave-function fidelities exceeding 99%. We further assess physical relevance by analysing generalized inverse participation ratios and multifractal dimensions for ground and excited states in one and two dimensions, demonstrating that optimized ML models reproduce localization, delocalization, and multifractality trends across the spectrum. Crucially, these qualitative predictions remain robust across four decades of the interaction strength, e.g. spanning across superfluid, Mott-insulating, as well as quantum chaotic regimes. Together, these results suggest ML as a viable qualitative predictor of many-body structure, complementing the quantitative strengths of exact diagonalization and tensor-network methods.

Title: Spin Hall and Edelstein effects in a ballistic quantum dot with Rashba spin-orbit coupling

Abstract: We study spin-resolved transport in a ballistic quantum dot with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, focusing on charge-to-spin conversion and spin Hall effect. In the regime where the dot size is comparable to the Fermi wavelength, we identify a clear crossover from weak localization to weak antilocalization as the Rashba coupling increases. This transition is accompanied by gate-tunable spin currents of Edelstein and spin Hall type, whose behavior reflects the underlying electron wavefunction interference. Notably, the Edelstein current shows an inflection point at the critical Rashba strength, signaling the crossover from weak localization to weak antilocalization. In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field we also report a transition in angular periodicity of the magnetoresistance -- from $\pi$ to $2\pi$ -- arising from the interplay between spin-orbit interaction and Zeeman coupling. These results establish a direct link between quantum coherence, charge-to-spin conversion, and geometric confinement in mesoscopic systems.

Title: Quantum Geometric Entropy Production and Entropy Hall Effect
Authors: Longjun Xiang, Jinxiong Jia, Jian Wang
Abstract: Quantum geometry, encoded in the Berry curvature and quantum metric, has unified diverse anomalous transport phenomena in solids, yet a microscopic quantum-geometric theory of entropy transport for Bloch electrons is still lacking. We formulate an entropy continuity equation for noninteracting fermions driven by an electric field, starting from the von Neumann entropy, and obtain quantum-mechanical expressions for the entropy current density and entropy production rate. Introducing relaxation through a relaxation-time dissipator, we identify the quantum metric as the origin of the leading entropy production, providing a direct microscopic diagnostic of dissipation in both the extrinsic Drude response and an intrinsic nonlinear Ohmic contribution controlled by quantum metric. We further predict an entropy Hall effect arising from the Berry curvature and show that it obeys an Onsager reciprocal relation with the anomalous Nernst effect under a temperature gradient. Finally, we establish universal relations connecting entropy and charge currents under DC and AC driving, offering experimentally accessible probes of quantum geometry through nonequilibrium entropy flow.

Title: Topological superconducting phase in a non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with staggered pairing imbalance
Authors: Xiao-Jue Zhang, Rong Lü, Qi-Bo Zeng
Abstract: We introduce a one-dimensional non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with staggered imbalance in the $p$-wave superconducting pairing. By tuning the chemical potential and the pairing imbalance, we find that the eigenenergy spectrum undergoes real-to-complex transitions, and the spectral gap can change from a real to an imaginary line gap. The pairing imbalance significantly enlarges the parameter region supporting a topological superconducting phase. Remarkably, we show that a topologically nontrivial phase hosting Majorana zero modes can be induced by varying the pairing imbalance, even in the regime of strong chemical potential. The gap-closing points and phase boundaries are determined analytically, and the resulting phase diagrams are characterized by a nonzero topological invariant. Furthermore, we identify the existence of Majorana zero modes and finite-energy Majorana edge modes in this system. Our results reveal exotic phenomena arising from imbalanced pairing and establish a new platform for exploring topological superconductivity in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Atomistic Approach to Exciton-Phonon Couplings in Semiconductor Quantum Dots
Authors: Yasser Saleem, Moritz Cygorek
Abstract: We present a fully atomistic approach to exciton-phonon coupling in semiconductor quantum dots that bridges microscopic electronic-structure calculations with non-Markovian open-quantum-system dynamics. On the example of an InAsP quantum dot embedded in an InP matrix, we compute single-particle states using an ab initio-parametrized tight-binding model, then obtain correlated many-body wave functions of neutral excitons, biexcitons, and charged trions via the configuration-interaction method. Using these correlated states, we compute the exciton-phonon coupling matrix elements. The resulting phonon spectral densities for different excitonic complexes are compared with the widely used analytical super-Ohmic form and reveal deviations at higher energies originating from the realistic dot geometry and atomistic wave functions, whereas configuration mixing is found to play only a minor role. Furthermore, we extract radiative lifetimes comparable to values experimentally measured. As a direct application, we simulate the emission brightness of a pulsed-driven quantum dot and demonstrate that the atomistically derived spectral density substantially broadens the region of efficient off-resonant excitation compared to the analytical model. The presented framework provides a nearly parameter-free route to simulate the non-Markovian open quantum dynamics in semiconductor quantum dots.

Title: Mandelbrot, Financial Markets and the Origins of "Econophysics"
Authors: Jean-Philippe Bouchaud
Abstract: This text revisits the origins of econophysics through the figure of Benoît Mandelbrot, not as the father of fractals, but as the instigator of a distinctive scientific posture. The guiding thread is methodological: accept the stubborn features of the data and use models as instruments for intuition rather than as axiomatic certificates of truth. In this perspective, scaling, intermittency and extremes are not peripheral imperfections around a well-behaved equilibrium; they are the very texture of economic and financial fluctuations. This naturally shifts attention from exogenous narratives to endogenous dynamics: interactions, feedback loops, and collective amplification mechanisms that can make systems intrinsically {\it fragile}. We argue that the importation of concepts from statistical physics -- criticality, disorder, emergence, multiplicative cascades -- should be read not as an artificial transposition but as a candid attempt to look for generic mechanisms compatible with empirical regularities observed across scales, from markets to macroeconomic aggregates.

Abstract: Several models of the strange-metal state of the cuprate superconductors postulate the existence of strong inelastic forward scattering of the electrons, but direct evidence of such scattering is missing. Here we show that angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) provides a unique tool which can address this issue. We propose a two-lifetime phenomenological model of the superconducting state of the cuprates and we show that it explains several salient low-energy features of the measured ARPES spectra. The model enables discrimination between forward- and large-angle scattering and, in addition, gives access to the magnitude of the gap function away from the Fermi surface.

Title: Nonreciprocity Induced Fractional Nonlinear Thouless Pumping
Authors: Yanqi Zheng, Kun Pu, Ligging Ren, Chenxi Bai, Zhaoxin Liang
Abstract: Recent interest has surged in eigenvalue's nonlinearity-based topological transport governed by the equation of auxiliary eigenvalues $H\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$ [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024); C. Bai and Z. Liang, 111, 042201 (2025); Phys. Rev. A 112, 052207 (2025)] rather than the conventional Schrodinger equation $H\Psi=E\Psi$ in conservative settings, yet non-Hermitian generalizations remain uncharted. In this work, we are motivated to investigate the nonlinear Thouless pumping in a non-Hermitian and nonlinear Rice-Mele model. In particular, we uncover how non-Hermiticity parameters can induce fractional topological phases--even in the presence of quantized topological invariants as predicted by conventional linear approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are naturally explained within the framework of the equation of auxiliary eigenvalues, directly linking nonlinear spectral characteristics to the bulk-boundary correspondence. Our findings reveal novel emergent phenomena arising from the interplay between nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity, providing key insights for the design of topological insulators and the controlled manipulation of quantum edge states in the real world.

Title: Microscopic simulations of the coupled dynamics of cavity photons, excitons, and biexcitons
Authors: Hendrik Rose, Stefan Schumacher, Torsten Meier
Abstract: The coherent interaction between quantum light and material excitations in semiconductor nanostructures is investigated using a fully quantized microscopic approach that incorporates many-body Coulomb correlations. The simulations demonstrate that the quantum dynamics is influenced by biexciton continuum states and is highly sensitive to both the frequency of the cavity mode and the strength of the light-matter coupling.

Title: Intersubband electric dipole spin resonance in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers
Authors: K.K. Grigoryan, M.M. Glazov
Abstract: The theory of inter-spin-subband electric dipole spin resonance in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers is proposed. Our symmetry analysis demonstrates that, in contrast to monolayers, the reduced symmetry of heterobilayers enables coupling between conduction band spin subbands by an electric field. We establish the optical selection rules for all six high-symmetry stacking configurations. The microscopic mechanism of the effect is identified as the spin-orbit coupling induced mixing of Bloch states from different conduction bands, which generates a non-zero momentum matrix element between the spin-split states. It also leads to the linear-in-wavevector spin-dependent terms in the effective Hamiltonian, i.e., the Rashba effect. Our estimates show that the rate of electric-dipole spin-flip transitions exceeds by far that of the magnetic-dipole transitions in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers.

Title: Machine-Learned Hamiltonians for Quantum Transport Simulation of Valence Change Memories
Authors: Chen Hao Xia, Manasa Kaniselvan, Marko Mladenoivić, Mathieu Luisier
Abstract: The construction of the Hamiltonian matrix \textbf{H} is an essential, yet computationally expensive step in \textit{ab-initio} device simulations based on density-functional theory (DFT). In homogeneous structures, the fact that a unit cell repeats itself along at least one direction can be leveraged to minimize the number of atoms considered and the calculation time. However, such an approach does not lend itself to amorphous or defective materials for which no periodicity exists. In these cases, (much) larger domains containing thousands of atoms might be needed to accurately describe the physics at play, pushing DFT tools to their limit. Here we address this issue by learning and directly predicting the Hamiltonian matrix of large structures through equivariant graph neural networks and so-called augmented partitioning training. We demonstrate the strength of our approach by modeling valence change memory (VCM) cells, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.39 to 3.58 meV, as compared to DFT, when predicting the Hamiltonian matrix entries of systems made of $\sim$5,000 atoms. We then replace the DFT-computed Hamiltonian of these VCMs with the predicted one to compute their energy-resolved transmission function with a quantum transport tool. A qualitatively good agreement between both sets of curves is obtained. Our work provides a path forward to overcome the memory and computational limits of DFT, thus enabling the study of large-scale devices beyond current \textit{ab-initio} capabilities

Title: Direct Observation of Unidirectional Density Wave and Band splitting in a Single-Domain Trilayer Nickelate Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$
Authors: Zhicheng Jiang, Enkang Zhang, Yuxin Wang, Zhengtai Liu, Jishan Liu, Runfeng Zhang, Xinnuo Zhang, Wenchuan Jing, Yu Huang, Qi Jiang, Mao Ye, Kun Jiang, Jun Zhao, Dawei Shen, Donglai Feng
Abstract: Unraveling the interplay between density-wave (DW) instabilities and multi-orbital physics is critical for understanding superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, yet intrinsic electronic features have been persistently obscured by material inhomogeneity and thus the multi-domain averaging effect. Here, we employ micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ($\mu$-ARPES) on single-domain Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ to disentangle the complex hierarchy of intrinsic and back-folded bands, explicitly identifying the electronic states driving the DW phase transition. We provide decisive spectroscopic evidence that the low-energy reconstruction is governed by inter-orbital nesting between the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands. Specifically, we resolve a orbital-dependent gap of $\sim44$ meV on the $\alpha$ pocket, a value quantitatively consistent with prior measurements, unifying previously conflicting experimental reports regarding the locus and magnitude of the DW gap. Furthermore, we reveal strong orbital-selective mass renormalization in the $d_{z^2}$ states and successfully resolve the long-sought intrinsic trilayer $\beta$-band splitting, establishing a critical lower bound for the outer-layer hopping. These results define a coherent microscopic fingerprint for the trilayer nickelates, identifying the specific nesting channels and correlation effects that underpin the phase diagram.

Title: Viscous Electron Flow and Nonlinear Magnetotransport in 2D Channels
Authors: A. D. Levin, G. M. Gusev, A. K. Bakarov
Abstract: We examine nonlinear transport in a viscous two-dimensional electron fluid within narrow GaAs channels. The differential magnetoresistance shows nonmonotonic behavior, a signature of electron pairing in the hydrodynamic regime. Theoretical models that account for both the influence of these interactions on shear stress relaxation and viscosity changes from electron heating show good agreement with the data. The nonlinear regime thus reveals how such correlated states govern the hydrodynamic behavior of the electron fluid. Our findings establish the nonlinear transport regime as a powerful probe for dissecting the complex interplay of correlated electron states and momentum relaxation in the hydrodynamic flow of an electron fluid.

Title: The Dose Makes the Poison: Perturbative Steps Toward the Ultimate Linearized Coupled Cluster Method
Authors: Sylvia J. Bintrim, Ella R. Ransford, Kevin Carter-Fenk
Abstract: "Addition-by-subtraction" coupled cluster (CC) approaches provide a promising approach to treating the difficult strong correlation problem by simplifying the standard CC equations. In a separate vein, linearized CC methods have drawn interest for their lower computational cost, increased parallelizability, and favorable properties for extension to the excited state--but the inclusion of ring/crossed-ring terms causes singularities even for single bond breaking. A linearized, addition-by-subtraction CC method called linearized ladder CCD (linLCCD) removes these terms to avoid divergences, but linLCCD under-estimates dynamical correlation. Herein we resolve this deficiency of linLCCD by introducing a linearized external coupled cluster perturbation theory that adds a second-order ring/crossed-ring correction back into a linLCCD reference wave function. Our resultant xlinCCD(2) method is regular and yields comparable results to linearized CCD in weakly-correlated regimes.

Title: Contrasting Momentum-Selective Spin-Density-Wave Gaps in Bilayer and Trilayer Nickelates
Authors: Jun Shu, Jun Shen, Xiaoxiang Zhou, Yinghao Zhu, Qingsong Wang, Dengjing Wang, Weihong He, Jie Yuan, Kui Jin, Dawei Shen, Congcong Le, Jun Zhao, Zengyi Du, Ge He, Donglai Feng
Abstract: Resolving where the density-wave gap opens in momentum space is essential for identifying the microscopic origin of the instability in layered nickelates. Using polarization-resolved electronic Raman scattering, we map the momentum selectivity of the spin-density-wave (SDW) gap in trilayer La4Ni3O10. We observe a SDW-induced redistribution of spectral weight on both the $\alpha$ pocket at the Brillouin-zone centre and a portion of the $\beta$ pocket near the zone boundary, characterized by gap energies of approximately 55~meV. In contrast, no comparable spectral weight suppression is observed along the diagonal region of $\beta$ pockets, implying little or no gap opening. This gap topology contrasts sharply with that in La3Ni2O7, where anisotropic SDW gaps open solely on the $\beta$ pocket. Our results establish a distinct momentum-space gap topology between bilayer and trilayer nickelates, placing new constraints on the ordering wave vector and the mechanism of the density-wave instability relevant to superconductivity.

Title: Interaction-induced moiré lattices: from mosaic mobility edges to many-body localization
Authors: Yan-Hao Yang, Zhihao Xu, Lei Ying, Qizhong Zhu
Abstract: We study localization driven solely by interparticle interactions in moiré lattice systems without intrinsic disorder or externally imposed quasiperiodic potentials. We consider a one-dimensional bilayer with incommensurate lattice constants, described by a spin-dependent Fermi-Hubbard-type model with short-range interlayer interactions, where quasiperiodicity emerges only through interactions. Exact diagonalization shows that quenching hopping in one layer generates an interaction-induced mosaic potential with multiple mobility edges. When both layers are dynamical, increasing interlayer interactions drives transitions among ergodic, critical, and many-body localized regimes, with energy-dependent coexistence in certain parameter ranges. An exact mapping to a noninteracting single-particle model on a higher-dimensional structured graph provides a unified interpretation of these results and suggests an experimentally accessible route to interaction-induced moiré physics and localization.

Title: Triplet Envelope Functions for increasing machine learning interatomic potential efficiency and stability
Authors: Emil Annevelink, Varun Shankar
Abstract: Central to interatomic potential efficiency is the radial envelope function that enables linear scaling with computational cost by defining a local neighborhood of atoms. This has enabled MLIPs to revolutionize materials science over the past decade by providing DFT accuracy with linear scaling computational cost in molecular dynamics workflows. However, MLIPs still have a relatively high computational cost compared to empirical interatomic potentials, preventing them from transforming molecular dynamics workflows. A central issue is that MLIPs use relatively large cutoff radii, converging to 6A over the last few years. The large cutoffs prioritize accuracy of any material over efficiency in any particular region of phase space, capturing dispersion effects and low density materials at the expense of increased computational cost in higher density materials. Past work has aimed to address this with KNN graph sparsification, which, while significantly reducing cost, has the drawback of breaking energy conservation. In this work, we propose higher-order envelope functions that prune local atomic neighborhoods through physically inspired geometric functions to provide the memory and efficiency benefits of KNN graph sparsification while eliminating non-conservative energy dynamics. Through numerical experiments on solids and liquids with 5-8A cutoffs, we show that triplet envelope functions complement radial envelope functions by doubling training and inference speed, tripling memory efficiency, and increasing simulation stability while not impacting accuracy or data efficiency for the most common 6A cutoff. Moreover, experiments with 8A radial cutoffs show triplet envelope functions create a pathway to larger cutoff radii for efficiently and accurately modeling open structures with large interatomic distances, showing a promising new direction for engineering MLIP efficiency.

Title: Symmetry-restricted energy landscapes as a benchmark for machine learned interatomic potentials
Authors: Abhijith S Parackal, Rickard Armiento, Florian Trybel
Abstract: Machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a standard method for DFT-level accurate molecular dynamics simulation and large-scale studies of crystal energetics. Increasingly popular are universal pre-trained potentials, also called foundation models, based one, e.g. the MACE, CHGNet, M3GNet, ORB, and SevenNet architectures. While there are many benchmarks of these models using validation errors and materials discovery tasks, their fidelity in reproducing the detailed features of potential energy surfaces (PES) is not understood to the same degree. We evaluate the accuracy of these potentials by systematically probing their predicted energy landscapes. Two-dimensional slices of the potential energy surface are constructed where the atomic positions are varied along selected Wyckoff degrees of freedom within a fixed crystal symmetry. This approach enables a direct, visual comparison of the interatomic potentials and DFT-calculated surfaces which reveals potential artifacts e.g., arising from unique local environments. Our analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of different potentials in capturing local minima, saddle points, and overall PES topology, offering insights into the physical accuracy of current pre-trained IAPs and providing benchmarks for future model development.

Title: Observing weakly broken conservation laws in a dipolar Rydberg quantum spin chain
Authors: Cheng Chen, Luca Capizzi, Alice Marché, Guillaume Bornet, Gabriel Emperauger, Thierry Lahaye, Antoine Browaeys, Maurizio Fagotti, Leonardo Mazza
Abstract: Integrable quantum many-body systems host families of extensive conservation laws, some of which are fragile: even infinitesimal perturbations can qualitatively alter their dynamical constraints. Here we show that this fragility leaves a clear experimental fingerprint in a one-dimensional quantum spin chain of as few as 14 Rydberg atoms. Weak integrability breaking from interatomic dipolar couplings is directly detectable within experimentally accessible times in the dynamics of non-local observables. In particular, magnetization fluctuations are highly sensitive to the breaking of fragile conservation laws and exhibit anomalous growth, which we observe experimentally; similar signatures appear in a semilocal string observable. Numerical simulations on substantially longer chains and a simplified classical stochastic model reproduce those features. We establish non-local observables as a sensitive probe of fragile conservation laws in quantum spin chains and Rydberg-atom arrays as a platform to test perturbative descriptions of quantum many-body dynamics with weak integrability breaking.

Title: Long-range phase coherence and phase patterns in hybrid Josephson junction arrays
Authors: Xi Wang, Asbjørn C. C. Drachmann, Candice Thomas, Michael J. Manfra, Nandini Trivedi, Charles M. Marcus, Saulius Vaitiekėnas, Beena Kalisky
Abstract: The coherence of superconductivity and its suppression near a quantum phase transition is governed by the interplay between local pairing and macroscopic phase coherence. Using scanning SQUID, we image the local susceptibility in a hybrid Josephson junction array. On a square lattice of narrow islands, we simultaneously access both the amplitude and spatial phase structure of sensitive superconducting states. We observe periodic phase patterns at commensurate magnetic fillings. At zero field the long-range phase coherence is strongest. At a finite field, smaller than one percent of flux quantum per unit cell, the system fragments into large regions of constant superconducting phase, as a function of the applied field. Our results provide the first direct measurement of long-range phase coherence in a Josephson junction array.

Title: Energy-Transfer-Enhanced Emission and Quantum Sensing of VB- Defects in hBN-PbI2 Heterostructures
Authors: Eveline Mayner, Yaroslav Zhumagulov, Cristian de Giorgio, Feihong Chu, Prabhu Swain, Georg Fantner, Andras Kis, Oleg Yazyev, Aleksandra Radenovic
Abstract: Spin defects in two-dimensional materials hold significant potential for quantum information technologies and sensing applications. The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has attracted considerable attention as a quantum sensor due to its demonstrated sensitivity to temperature, magnetic fields, and pressure.1 However, its applications have thus far been limited by inherently dim photoluminescence (PL). By fabricating a van der Waals heterostructure with a sensitizing donor layer, lead iodide (PbI2), we effectively enhance the PL intensity from the VB- by 5-45x, while maintaining compatibility with other heterostructures and vdW optoelectronic platforms. The type-I band alignment at the heterojunction enables efficient exciton migration while suppressing back-electron transfer, and the strong spectral overlap between the PbI2 emission and defect absorption supports efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) predicts a photon-ratcheting mechanism that boosts absorption and emission while maintaining magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast through minimal hybridization. Experimentally, the heterostructure exhibits enhanced continuous-wave ODMR sensitivity and functions as a precise probe of external magnetic fields. This work establishes a proof-of-concept for amplifying weak defect signals in nanomaterials, highlighting a new strategy for engineering their optical and magnetic responses.

Title: Non-Perturbative SDiff Covariance of Fractional Quantum Hall Excitations
Authors: Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber
Abstract: Collective excitations of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) liquids at long wavelengths are thought to be of a generally covariant geometric nature, governed by area-preserving diffeomorphisms ($\mathrm{SDiff}$). But current analyses rely solely on the corresponding perturbative $w_\infty$ Lie algebra. We argue this is insufficient: We identify a non-perturbative construction of the effective Maxwell-Chern-Simons quantum field theory which carries unitary $\mathrm{SDiff}$ equivariance. But this turns out to be non-differentiable, suggesting FQH excitation phenomenology beyond the $w_\infty$ algebra.

Title: Critical behavior and evidence of dimensional crossover in quasi-two-dimensional Li$_2$FeSiO$_4$
Authors: Waldemar Hergett, Kevin Ackermann, Erik Walendy, Sven Spachmann, Martin Jonak, Mahmoud Abdel-Hafiez, Maurits W. Haverkort, R. Klingeler
Abstract: We report thermal expansion and heat capacity studies on Li$_2$FeSiO$_4$ single crystals which enable us to investigate the critical behavior in the magnetically quasi-two-dimensional (2D) material. Pronounced $\lambda$-shaped anomalies at the magnetic ordering temperature $T_{\rm N}$ imply significant magneto-elastic coupling. Our analysis of both the thermal expansion and the specific heat data implies the crossover from 2D Ising-like behavior for $|(T-T_{\rm N})/T_{\rm N}|>0.3$ to 3D Ising behavior \rev{below $\simeq 1.3\times T_{\rm N}$. The 2D-like behavior is further supported by density functional calculations which show minimal dispersion perpendicular to the crystallographic $ac$ planes of the layered structure, thereby indicating the 2D nature of magnetism at higher temperatures.} Our results extend the available model materials of quasi-2D magnetism to a high-spin $S=2$ system with tetrahedrally coordinated Fe$^{2+}$-ions, thereby illustrating how magnetic order evolves in a 2D Ising-like system with orbital degrees of freedom.

Title: Reexamining the strange metal charge response with transmission inelastic electron scattering
Authors: Niels de Vries, Eric Hoglund, Dipanjan Chaudhuri, Sang hyun Bae, Jin Chen, Xuefei Guo, David Balut, Genda Gu, Pinshane Huang, Jordan Hachtel, Peter Abbamonte
Abstract: The strange metal remains one of the great unsolved problems for 21st century science. Since the early development of the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology, it has been clear that progress requires detailed knowledge of the momentum- and frequency-dependent charge susceptibility, $\chi(\mathbf{q},\omega)$, particularly at large momenta. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), performed in either reflection or transmission geometry, provides the most direct probe of $\chi(\mathbf{q},\omega)$. However, measurements over the past four decades have yielded conflicting results, with some studies reporting a dispersing RPA-like plasmon and others observing a strongly overdamped, incoherent response. Here we report a transmission EELS study of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) that simultaneously achieves high energy resolution ($\Delta E \approx 30$ meV) and high momentum resolution ($\Delta q \approx 0.01$ Å$^{-1}$). To address issues of reproducibility, measurements were repeated ten times on five different Bi-2212 flakes, benchmarked against aluminum, a well-characterized Fermi liquid, and quantitatively compared with prior studies spanning four decades. At momenta $q < 0.15$ Å$^{-1}$, we observe a highly damped plasmon whose linewidth is comparable to its energy. At larger momenta, $q > 0.15$ Å$^{-1}$, this excitation does not disperse but instead evolves into an incoherent continuum, with no evidence for the RPA-like dispersion reported in some earlier works. Comparison with recent RIXS measurements on Bi-based cuprates supports the view that Bi-2212 is an incoherent metal with strongly damped charge excitations.

Title: Mechanics of incompatible asymmetric grain boundary migration
Authors: Brandon Runnels
Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) migration governs microstructure evolution and can mediate plastic deformation through sliding or shear coupling. Numerous experimental and numerical studies have reported a wide range of behaviors associated with boundary migration, such as defect emission or mode switching. Notably, recent studies have reported directionally asymmetric migration rates under symmetric loading, attributing this behavior to intrinsically asymmetric mobility; however, a mechanistic mesoscale explanation for this behavior remains lacking. In this work, we introduce a constitutive flow rule for grain-boundary eigendeformation within a multiphase-field framework, in which interfacial shear evolves in response to its mechanically conjugate driving force through the phase field Allen-Cahn equations. The formulation systematically employs regularized grain boundary shear kinematics informed by crystallography, and enables elastic compatibility to modulate boundary motion. Migration thresholds, residual back-stress, and apparent directional asymmetry appear naturally as emergent mechanical behavior. Simulations of symmetric and asymmetric tilt grain boundaries under mechanical, synthetic, and curvature-driven loading reveal persistent defect-like residuals following incompatible migration, transitions from planar motion to lamination at large inclinations, and even "ratcheting" behavior. These results provide a mechanically transparent explanation for behaviors such as effective mobility asymmetry and establish elastic compatibility as a constitutive mechanism in mesoscale models of boundary-mediated plasticity.

Title: Unbounded Systematic Error in Thin Film Conductivity Measurements
Authors: Yongyi Gao, Hio-Ieng Un, Yuxuan Huang, Henning Sirringhaus, Ian E. Jacobs
Abstract: Electrical conductivity is the most fundamental charge transport parameter, and measurements of conductivity are a basic part of materials characterization for nearly all conducting materials. In thin films, conductivity is often measured in four bar architectures in which the current source and voltage measurement are spatially separated to eliminate systematic error due to contact resistance. Despite the apparent simplicity of these measurements, we demonstrate here that the four bar architecture is subject to significant systematic error arising from the finite conductivity of the metal electrodes. Remarkably, these systematic errors can in some cases become unbounded, producing arbitrarily high measured conductivity at modest true film conductivities, within the range relevant to emerging thin film thermoelectric materials such as conducting polymers. These unbounded errors, which can occur even in properly conducted four-point measurements of patterned films, likely explain literature reports of extremely high conductivities in conducting polymers, and can lead to anomalous scaling in temperature dependent studies, potentially leading to incorrect interpretation of the relevant charge transport mechanism. We characterize the device geometric factors that control these errors, which stand partially at odds with those required for accurate Seebeck coefficient measurements. Our analyses allow us to identify device architectures that provide small systematic errors for conductivity and Seebeck coefficient while still providing a low measurement resistance, critical to reducing noise in thermal voltage measurements. These findings provide important guidelines for accurate measurements in the growing field of thin-film thermoelectric materials.

Title: Electromagnetic Response of a Half-Filled Chern Band near Topological Criticality
Authors: Xinlei Yue, Fabian Pichler, Michael Knap, Ady Stern
Abstract: We evaluate electromagnetic-response observables in a half-filled Chern band, across a topological phase transition between a composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and a Fermi liquid (FL) phase. While a sharp gapped plasma mode exists deep in the CFL phase, we demonstrate that it is damped near the proposed continuous phase transition between CFL and FL. This plasmon-damping phenomenon originates from emergent gauge fields and a Dirac-fermion-like spectrum. Similar features also occur in other continuous deconfined topological phase transitions, such as the Laughlin to superfluid transition in a bosonic system. In particular, this damping behavior extends over a finite range across the phase boundary, and, hence, we expect it to persist even when the transition is weakly first-order. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of the Drude weight, the wavevector-dependent conductivity, and the chiral mirror effect across these topological phase transitions.

Title: Nonlinear light cone spreading of correlations in a triangular quantum magnet: a hard quantum simulation target
Authors: A. Scheie, J. Willsher, E. A. Ghioldi, Kevin Wang, P. Laurell, J. E. Moore, C. D. Batista, J. Knolle, D. Alan Tennant
Abstract: Dynamical correlations of quantum many-body systems are typically analyzed in the momentum space and frequency basis. However, quantum simulators operate more naturally in real space, real time settings. Here we analyze the real-space time-dependent van Hove spin correlations $G(r,t)$ of the 2D triangular antiferromagnet KYbSe$_2$ as obtained from high-resolution Fourier-transformed neutron spectroscopy. We compare this to $G(r,t)$ from five theoretical simulations of the well-established spin Hamiltonian. Our analysis reveals non-linear sub-ballistic low-temperature transport in KYbSe$_2$ which none of the current state-of-the-art numerical or field-theoretical methods reproduce. Our observation signals an emergent collective hydrodynamics, perhaps associated with the quantum critical phase of a quantum spin liquid, and provides an ideal benchmark for future quantum simulations.

Title: Dynamic nuclear spin polarization in the fractional quantum Hall effect spin transitions
Authors: Haotian Zhou, Yuli Lyanda-Geller
Abstract: Experiments suggest that nuclear spins play a significant role in the quantum Hall effect (QHE) near integer and fractional QHE spin transitions, but many of these phenomena still remain to be understood. Here we study theoretically the dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) in the two-dimensional electron liquid near a quantum point contact (QPC) or a domain wall between spin polarized and unpolarized phases induced by electrostatic gating in the fractional QHE at a filling factor 2/3 and analyze the dependence of the spin transition on temperature and the magnitude of the flowing current. We demonstrate that nearly all nuclear spins in the QPC or in the domain wall can be polarized by the electric current. The Overhauser effective magnetic field from the DNP can be strong enough to induce (or modify) a phase transition between polarized and unpolarized phases. This changes the gate voltages and magnetic fields required for the spin transitions, and leads to the reconstruction of the boundary between two phases and a domain wall and a current path displacement. The spread of nuclear spin polarization and the domain wall displacement are strongly asymmetric with respect to the direction of the current flow. Equilibration due to hyperfine interactions and its role on the nuclear spin polarization, domain wall displacements and spin transitions is studied. Back and forth oscillatory transitions between polarized and unpolarized phases near a source contact are discussed. Hyperfine interactions of nuclear spins provide a route for observation and control of the parafermion zero modes that can be induced when the domain wall between the polarized and unpolarized regions is placed in the proximity of a superconductor

Title: Renewal theory for a run-and-tumble particle with stochastic resetting and a sticky boundary
Authors: Paul C Bressloff, Samantha Linn
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) with stochastic resetting confined to the half line $[0,\infty)$ with a sticky boundary at $x=0$. In the bulk the RTP tumbles at a constant rate $\alpha>0$ between velocity states $\pm v$ with $v>0$ and randomly resets to its initial position and orientation $(x_0,k_0)\in(\mathbb{R}^+,\pm)$. When the RTP reaches the target at $x=0$ it attaches to the boundary for a random waiting time before either detaching and continuing to navigate the bulk domain or (permanently) entering the target. These events are the analogs of adsorption, desorption, and absorption of a particle by a partially reactive surface in physical chemistry. We use renewal theory to characterize the particle trajectory in terms of successive binding events under two distinct desorption protocols: via resetting to $(x_0,k_0)$ and via continuous movement from $x=0$ with velocity $+v$. First we derive the nonequilibrum stationary state (NESS) in the case of no absorption and characterize the accumulation at the boundary. Second, we compute the mean first passage time (MFPT) statistics. In addition to observing the usual unimodal dependence of the MFPT on bulk resetting, both the NESS and MFPT strongly depend on the initial orientation $k_0$ and the desorption protocol. For instance, if the initial orientation is toward the boundary, we find that the desorption-induced resetting protocol can reduce the MFPT more effectively than the non-resetting desorption protocol. We also show how matching the desorption kinetics with the bulk resetting or tumbling rate introduces a trade-off between minimizing the adsorption and absorption times. In this setting we find that the desorption protocol which minimizes the absorption MFPT for a given set of parameters is almost always the opposite of that favored when desorption and bulk kinetics are not the same.

Title: Resolution of the Two-Dimensional Ferromagnetic Spin-3/2 Ising Model via Cluster Growth
Authors: J. Roberto Viana, Octavio D. Rodriguez Salmon, Minos A. Neto, Griffith Mendonça, F. Dinóla Neto
Abstract: We propose a computational methodology based on a hierarchical cluster growth process to solve spin-3/2 Ising models efficiently. The method circumvents the exponential complexity (\(4^{N}\)) of the canonical ensemble partition function by iteratively constructing finite magnetic clusters of size \(N_g\), where the effective spin state of a site in generation \(g+1\) is determined by the local magnetization of a cluster from generation \(g\). This approach, which shares conceptual ground with effective field theories, allows the study of systems of effectively very large size \(N = N_0 (N_g)^{g}\). We apply the formalism to the ferromagnetic spin-3/2 Ising model on a honeycomb lattice, modeling the monolayer CrI$_3$, a prototypical two-dimensional Ising magnet. The model, calibrated using the experimental transition temperature (\(T_{c} \simeq 45\) K), successfully reproduces key experimental features: the temperature dependence of the magnetization \(m(T)\), including its inflection point, and the broadened peak in the specific heat \(c_v(T)\). We also compute the entropy \(s(T)\), finding a finite residual value at low temperatures consistent with the system's double degeneracy. Our results demonstrate that this hierarchical cluster method provides a quantitatively accurate and computationally efficient framework for studying complex magnetic systems.

Title: Frequency Stability of Graphene Nonlinear Parametric Oscillator
Authors: Enise Kartal, Oriel Shoshani, Elena Botnaru, Alberto Martín-Pérez, Tomás Manzaneque, Farbod Alijani
Abstract: High-frequency stability is crucial for the performance of graphene resonators in sensing and timekeeping applications. However, the extreme miniaturization and high mechanical compliance that make graphene attractive also render it highly susceptible to nonlinearities, degrading frequency stability. Here, we demonstrate that graphene parametric oscillators provide an alternative nonlinear operating regime, where short-term frequency stability can be enhanced despite strong nonlinearity. By operating graphene resonators in a phase-locked loop (PLL), we experimentally demonstrate that parametric oscillations in the post-bifurcation regime achieve lower Allan deviation at fast integration times than Duffing oscillations at identical amplitudes. This improvement originates from strong nonlinear damping inherent to parametric oscillators, which suppresses amplitude-to-frequency noise conversion at large amplitudes. A minimal theoretical model captures observed phase diffusion and identifies nonlinear damping as the dominant mechanism governing phase noise reduction. These results highlight the role of nonlinear dissipation in enabling precision sensing beyond conventional limits of graphene oscillators.

Title: Orbital Magnetization of Interacting Electrons
Authors: Xi Chen, Zhi-Da Song
Abstract: We derive an exact expression for the orbital magnetization of electrons with short-range interactions (such as density-density interactions) in terms of exact zero-frequency response functions of the zero-field system. The result applies to weakly and strongly correlated electrons at zero and finite temperature, provided that the local grand potential density only depends on local thermodynamic parameters. We benchmark the formula for non-interacting and weakly-coupled electrons. To zeroth and first orders in the interaction strength, it agrees with the modern theory of orbital magnetization and its recent generalization to self-consistent Hartree-Fock bands. Our work provides an exact framework of interacting orbital magnetization beyond mean-field treatments, and paves the way for quantitative studies of strongly correlated electrons in external magnetic fields.

Title: Visualizing the Odd-parity Superconducting Order Parameter and its Quasiparticle Surface Band in UTe2
Authors: Shuqiu Wang, J.C. Séamus Davis
Abstract: A distinctive identifier of nodal intrinsic topological superconductivity (ITS) would the appearance of an Andreev bound state on crystal surfaces parallel to the nodal axis, in the form of a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) appearing only for $T < T_C$. Moreover, theory shows that specific QSB characteristics observable in tunneling to an s-wave superconductor can distinguish between chiral and non-chiral ITS order parameter $\Delta_k$. To search for such phenomena in $\text{UTe}_2$, s-wave superconductive scan-tip scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging was employed. It reveals an intense zero-energy Andreev conductance maximum at the $\text{UTe}_2$ (0-11) crystal termination. Development of the zero-energy Andreev conductance peak into two finite-energy particle-hole symmetric conductance maxima as the tunnel barrier is reduced, then signifies that $\text{UTe}_2$ superconductivity is non-chiral. Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) for an ITS material should be dominated by the QSB for energies within the superconductive energy gap $|E| \le \Delta$, so that bulk $\Delta(k)$ characteristics of the ITS can only be detected excursively. Again using a superconducting scan-tip, the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of the QSB of $\text{UTe}_2$ were visualized. Specifically, a band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears as a characteristic sextet $q_i$ :$i = 1-6$ of interference wavevectors showing that QSB dispersions $k(E)$ occur only for energies $|E| \le \Delta_{max}$ and only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface. In combination, these phenomena are consistent with a bulk $\Delta(k)$ exhibiting spin triplet, time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, $B_{3u}$ symmetry in $\text{UTe}_2$.

Title: Information Propagation and Encoding in Solids: A Quantitative Approach Towards Mechanical Intelligence
Authors: Peerasait Prachaseree, Emma Lejeune
Abstract: Engineered systems typically separate mechanical function from information processing, whereas biological systems can exploit physical structure as a medium for information processing and computation. Motivated by this contrast, recent work in mechanics has explored embedding information-processing capabilities directly into mechanical structures. However, quantitative frameworks for evaluating such capabilities remain limited. Here we address a foundational question: how does information propagate through a solid body? Using elastic bodies as a model system, we apply information-theoretic tools to treat an elastic domain as an information encoder and quantify how information transmits from applied loads to discrete sensor locations. We further connect these measures to familiar mechanical phenomena, including Saint-Venant's effect and principal stress lines. Moving toward design, we show how geometry and architected materials can tune transmission, enabling elastic domains to either transmit or block information. Overall, this work advances quantifiable metrics and benchmark tasks for mechanical intelligence, supporting comparable designs of mechanically embodied information processing.

Title: Effects of PLGA coating on biological and mechanical behaviors of tissue engineering scaffolds
Authors: A.M. Maadani, F. Davoodian, E. Salahinejad
Abstract: Scaffolds have a key role in the clinical success of tissue engineering for the regeneration of damaged tissues. Their bio-performance is often described as the extent to which they can provide an extracellular matrix-like environment for cells embedded where their function and growth can effectively continue. For this purpose, tissue engineering scaffolds should exhibit biodegradability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, delivery, and mechanical performance. The use of polymer coatings, especially poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), on tissue engineering scaffolds has been found to be one of the most effective methods to improve the scaffold properties. This paper reviews the techniques used to coat tissue engineering scaffolds with PLGA and its effects on the mechanical characteristics, biodegradability, biocompatibility, Molecular delivery, and osteointegration of the scaffolds. It is concluded that apart from apatite-formation ability, all bio-functionalities can be tuned through PLGA coatings. This reflects the great potential of this modification approach to be used in tissue regeneration and therapeutic delivery applications.

Title: Signatures of coherent initial ensembles on all work moments
Authors: Pranay Nayak, Sreenath K. Manikandan, Tan Van Vu, Supriya Krishnamurthy
Abstract: Standard treatments of quantum work using projective energy measurements erase initial coherence and alter the dynamics, thereby failing to capture the thermodynamic effects of coherent superpositions of energy eigenstates in an ensemble of initial states. In this article, we use an operational work definition that is non-intrusive, applying it to the case of a driven dissipative qubit, where the qubit's initial preparation comprises coherent superposition states, while the driving is coherence-less. We derive an evolution equation for the moment generating function for this work, faithfully capturing the thermodynamic signature of coherent superpositions in the initial ensemble. We demonstrate that different initial ensembles that correspond to the same density matrix upon ensemble average, while having the same average work, display different work fluctuations. For monotonic driving, we show that fluctuations are maximum for coherence-less initial ensembles. As an application, we consider quantum bit-erasure in finite time and demonstrate significantly different work statistics for erasing a classical bit of information versus a Haar random initial ensemble. Our results indicate that coherence in the initial ensemble can be utilized as a resource for thermodynamic precision without incurring additional dissipative work costs. We also obtain a generalized fluctuation theorem that establishes a new quantum lower bound on the mean dissipated work. This bound, counterintuitively, is also applicable to a "classical" initial ensemble with the same initial density matrix and is connected to quantum absolute irreversibility.

Title: Complexity of Quantum Trajectories
Authors: Luca Lumia, Emanuele Tirrito, Mario Collura, Fabian H.L. Essler, Rosario Fazio
Abstract: Open quantum systems can be described by unraveling Lindblad master equations into ensembles of quantum trajectories. Here we investigate how the complexity of such trajectories is affected by conservation laws and other dynamical constraints of the underlying Lindblad evolution. We characterize this complexity using a data-driven approach based on the intrinsic dimension, defined as the minimal number of variables required to encode the information contained in a data set. Applying this framework to several systems, including dissipative variants of the quantum top and of the XXZ chain, we find that the intrinsic dimension is sensitive to the structure of their dynamics. The Lindblad evolution in these systems is typically chaotic, but additional constraints arise at specific parameter values, where the dynamics becomes integrable, exhibits Hilbert-space fragmentation, or develops a closed BBGKY hierarchy, leading to pronounced minima in the intrinsic dimension. Our approach results in an unsupervised probe of the complexity of dissipative quantum systems that is sensitive to chaos and ergodicity breaking phenomena beyond the initial transient regime.

Title: Fermionic magic resources in disordered quantum spin chains
Authors: Pedro R. Nicácio Falcão, Jakub Zakrzewski, Piotr Sierant
Abstract: Fermionic non-Gaussianity quantifies a quantum state's deviation from a classically tractable free-fermionic description, constituting a necessary resource for computational quantum advantage. Here we use fermionic antiflatness (FAF) to measure this deviation across ergodic and many-body localized (MBL) regimes. We focus on the paradigmatic disordered spin-$1\!/2$ XXZ chain and its impurity variant with local interactions. Across highly excited eigenstates, FAF evolves from typical-state behavior at weak disorder to strongly suppressed values deep in the MBL regime, with volume-law scaling in the XXZ chain and an area-law bound in the impurity setting. Rare long range catlike eigenstates exhibit a pronounced enhancement of FAF, making it a sensitive diagnostic of mechanisms proposed to destabilize MBL. Starting from product states, we find that in the MBL regime FAF grows slowly in time, approaching saturation via a power-law relaxation. Overall, our results show that MBL suppresses fermionic non-Gaussianity, and the associated complexity beyond free fermions, while ergodicity restores it, motivating explorations of fermionic non-Gaussianity in other ergodicity-breaking phenomena.

Title: From Feynman-Vernon to Wiener Stochastic Path Integral
Authors: Antonio Camurati, Felipe Sobrero, Bruno Suassuna, Pedro V. Paraguassú
Abstract: We establish a direct connection between the Feynman-Vernon path integral formalism for open quantum systems and the Wiener path integral used in classical stochastic dynamics. By considering a generalized influence functional in the strong decoherence limit, we demonstrate that integrating over the quantum coherence length leads to a derivation of stochastic Langevin dynamics. Specifically, we show that the quantum Feynman measure transforms into the stochastic Wiener measure. Applying this framework to the Wigner function representation, we show that the system follows a stochastic path interpretable via classical probability theory. Finally, we address the inverse problem: constructing an equivalent quantum influence functional from a given classical Langevin equation.

Title: A room-temperature cavity-magnonic source of correlated microwave pairs
Authors: Qiuyuan Wang, Aravind Karthigeyan, Chung-Tao Chou, Luqiao Liu
Abstract: Correlated microwave photon sources are key enablers for technologies in quantum-limited sensing, signal amplification and communication, but the reliance on millikelvin operating temperature limits their scalability for broader applications. Here, at room temperature, we demonstrate strong correlated microwave signals emitted from a hybrid magnon-photon platform. Different from traditional parametrically induced magnons with degenerate frequencies, we achieve non-degenerate excitations by coupling magnon modes simultaneously with two cavity photon modes. Through the magnon-photon interactions in the corresponding linear and nonlinear regimes, one input microwave photon splits into a pair of magnon polaritons that possess distinct frequencies but maintain strong inter-mode correlations. The nonlinear magnon polariton dynamics empowered by this new parametric platform brings both verified true randomness and robust multi-channel correlations, from which we construct a microwave communication experiment for noise resilient signal transmission with added security. This work establishes cavity magnonics as a versatile and compact platform for generating correlated multi-mode microwave signals, opening new avenues for applications in classical and quantum domains.

Title: Neural Ising Machines via Unrolling and Zeroth-Order Training
Authors: Sam Reifenstein, Timothee Leleu
Abstract: We propose a data-driven heuristic for NP-hard Ising and Max-Cut optimization that learns the update rule of an iterative dynamical system. The method learns a shared, node-wise update rule that maps local interaction fields to spin updates, parameterized by a compact multilayer perceptron with a small number of parameters. Training is performed using a zeroth-order optimizer, since backpropagation through long, recurrent Ising-machine dynamics leads to unstable and poorly informative gradients. We call this approach a neural network parameterized Ising machine (NPIM). Despite its low parameter count, the learned dynamics recover effective algorithmic structure, including momentum-like behavior and time-varying schedules, enabling efficient search in highly non-convex energy landscapes. Across standard Ising and neural combinatorial optimization benchmarks, NPIM achieves competitive solution quality and time-to-solution relative to recent learning-based methods and strong classical Ising-machine heuristics.

Title: Predicting the hydrogen bond strength from water reorientation dynamics at short timescales
Authors: Frederik Zysk, Ana Vila Verde, Naveen K. Kaliannan, Kristof Karhan, Thomas D. Kühne
Abstract: Path-integral molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure-based energy decomposition analysis (EDA) are employed to connect hydrogen bond (H-bond) strength, its asymmetry, and the total delocalization energy at the water/air interface to experimentally measurable observables, such as the reorientation dynamics and the sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectrum. Using SFG spectra for distinct layers at the water/air interface, we validate the accuracy of our simulations and report a red-shift from the interface to bulk and a strongly bonded water peak at around 3250 cm$^{-1}$ in the layer closest to bulk. The reorientation dynamics of water molecules slow down from the interface to bulk, which correlates with the SFG results. From our EDA based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals, we observe a strong decline in total delocalization energy from bulk to the interface, as well as a decline in the strength of the strongest donor and acceptor interactions. The asymmetry between the two strongest interactions similarly rises towards the interface, while the importance of interactions from the outer solvation shells is greatly diminished and is lower than previously reported. Finally, we find that the strength of the strongest H-bond donor/acceptor is best correlated with the local minimum of the autocorrelation function resembling the L2 band librational motions. Following that, we propose a simple yet quantitative relationship between H-bond strength and the short-time reorientation dynamics at the water/air interface that could potentially be extended to predict H-bond strength in other hydrophobic systems from experimentally obtainable observables.

Title: Dynamical witnesses and universal behavior across chaos and non-ergodicity in the tilted Bose-Hubbard model
Authors: Carlos Diaz-Mejia, Sergio Lerma-Hernandez, Jorge G. Hirsch
Abstract: Quantum chaos in isolated quantum systems is intimately linked to thermalization and the rapid relaxation of observables. Although the spectral properties of the chaotic phase in the tilted Bose-Hubbard model have been well characterized, the corresponding dynamical signatures across the transition to regularity remain less explored . In this work, we investigate this transition by analyzing the time evolution of the survival probability, the single-site entanglement entropy, and the half-chain imbalance. Our results reveal a clear hierarchy in the sensitivity of these observables: the relaxation value of the entanglement entropy varies smoothly as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters across the chaos-regular transition, while the imbalance exhibits a more pronounced distinction. Most notably, the survival probability emerges as the most robust indicator of the transition between chaos and regularity. When appropriately scaled, all three observables converge onto a common behavior as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters for different numbers of sites and bosons,enabling a universal characterization of the transition between chaotic and regular dynamics.

Title: Ultrasensitive, universal single-ion nanodetector
Authors: Namita Narendra, Tillmann Kubis
Abstract: In this paper, a carbon nanotube (CNT) based single-ion detector is proposed and its performance is evaluated with atomistic quantum transport models. The sensor can detect any ion type without molecule-specific functionalization and allows for continuous real-time ion monitoring. A single ion temporarily changes the operating principle of the sensor's CNT field-effect transistor into a resonant tunneling diode. The concrete device example of this paper showed a source-drain current increase of 5 orders of magnitude induced by a single ion.

Title: Open Materials Generation with Inference-Time Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Philipp Hoellmer, Stefano Martiniani
Abstract: Continuous-time generative models for crystalline materials enable inverse materials design by learning to predict stable crystal structures, but incorporating explicit target properties into the generative process remains challenging. Policy-gradient reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled mechanism for aligning generative models with downstream objectives but typically requires access to the score, which has prevented its application to flow-based models that learn only velocity fields. We introduce Open Materials Generation with Inference-time Reinforcement Learning (OMatG-IRL), a policy-gradient RL framework that operates directly on the learned velocity fields and eliminates the need for the explicit computation of the score. OMatG-IRL leverages stochastic perturbations of the underlying generation dynamics preserving the baseline performance of the pretrained generative model while enabling exploration and policy-gradient estimation at inference time. Using OMatG-IRL, we present the first application of RL to crystal structure prediction (CSP). Our method enables effective reinforcement of an energy-based objective while preserving diversity through composition conditioning, and it achieves performance competitive with score-based RL approaches. Finally, we show that OMatG-IRL can learn time-dependent velocity-annealing schedules, enabling accurate CSP with order-of-magnitude improvements in sampling efficiency and, correspondingly, reduction in generation time.

Title: Single-site dissipation stabilizes a superconducting nonequilibrium steady state in a strongly correlated lattice
Authors: X. Z. Zhang
Abstract: Can superconducting order be made a robust attractor of open-system dynamics in strongly correlated lattices? We demonstrate that it can by proposing a minimal dissipation-engineering protocol for the particle--hole symmetric Hubbard model. By applying a rotated quantum jump operator, a locally transformed $\eta$-pair lowering operator, on as little as a single lattice site, we show that the Lindblad evolution autonomously pumps the system from the vacuum into a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) with macroscopic $\eta$-pair off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO). Crucially, this local-to-global synchronization contrasts with schemes requiring spatially extensive reservoirs: here, a strictly local dissipative seed suffices to establish coherence across the interacting system. We elucidate the mechanism via local dark-state selection, controlled elimination of off-manifold excursions induced by hopping, and a Liouvillian invariant-subspace structure that yields an attractive fixed point with a finite dissipative gap. Furthermore, we classify the stability of this NESS against static disorder, identifying a broad regime where the superconducting attractor is resilient to Hamiltonian perturbations that leave the effective subspace structure intact, while pinpointing specific perturbations that directly dephase the $\eta$-pseudospin coherence and suppress ODLRO. Our results establish a disorder-tolerant route to stabilizing superconducting order as a non-thermal attractor via minimal local quantum-jump control.

Title: Fidelity and quantum geometry approach to Dirac exceptional points in diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers
Authors: Chia-Yi Ju, Gunnar Möller, Yu-Chin Tzeng
Abstract: Dirac exceptional points (EPs) represent a novel class of non-Hermitian singularities that, unlike conventional EPs, reside entirely within the parity-time unbroken phase and exhibit linear energy dispersion. Here, we theoretically investigate the quantum geometry of Dirac EPs realized in nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, utilizing fidelity susceptibility as a probe. We demonstrate that despite the absence of a symmetry-breaking phase transition, the Dirac EP induces a pronounced geometric singularity, confirming the validity of fidelity in characterizing non-Hermitian EPs. Specifically, the real part of the fidelity susceptibility diverges to negative infinity, which serves as a signature of non-Hermitian criticality. Crucially, however, we reveal that this divergence exhibits a distinct anisotropy, diverging along the non-reciprocal coupling direction while remaining finite along the detuning axis. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the omnidirectional divergence observed in conventional EPs. Our findings provide a comprehensive picture of the fidelity probe near the Dirac EP, highlighting the critical role of parameter directionality in exploiting Dirac EPs for quantum control and sensing applications.

Title: Emergence of Distortions in High-Dimensional Guided Diffusion Models
Authors: Enrico Ventura, Beatrice Achilli, Luca Ambrogioni, Carlo Lucibello
Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto standard for conditional sampling in diffusion models, yet it often leads to a loss of diversity in generated samples. We formalize this phenomenon as generative distortion, defined as the mismatch between the CFG-induced sampling distribution and the true conditional distribution. Considering Gaussian mixtures and their exact scores, and leveraging tools from statistical physics, we characterize the onset of distortion in a high-dimensional regime as a function of the number of classes. Our analysis reveals that distortions emerge through a phase transition in the effective potential governing the guided dynamics. In particular, our dynamical mean-field analysis shows that distortion persists when the number of modes grows exponentially with dimension, but vanishes in the sub-exponential regime. Consistent with prior finite-dimensional results, we further demonstrate that vanilla CFG shifts the mean and shrinks the variance of the conditional distribution. We show that standard CFG schedules are fundamentally incapable of preventing variance shrinkage. Finally, we propose a theoretically motivated guidance schedule featuring a negative-guidance window, which mitigates loss of diversity while preserving class separability.

Title: Energy Absorption Interferometry
Authors: Stafford Withington, Willem Jellema
Abstract: Energy Absorption Interferometry (EAI) is a technique for measuring the responsivities and complex-valued spatial polarimetric forms of the individual degrees of freedom through which a many-body system can absorb energy. It was originally formulated using the language of quantum correlation functions, making it applicable to different kinds of excitation (electromagnetic, elastic and acoustic fields). EAI has been applied in a variety of theoretical and experimental ways. It is particularly effective at characterising the multimode behaviour of ultra-low-noise far-infrared and optical devices, imaging arrays, and complete instruments, where it can be used to ensure that a system is maximally responsive to those partially coherent fields that carry signal whilst avoiding those that only carry noise. Despite its utility there is no comprehensive overview of electromagnetic EAI. In this paper we describe the theoretical foundations of the method, and present a range of new techniques in areas relating to sampling, phase referencing, mode reconstruction and noise. We present, for the first time, an analysis of how noise propagates through an experiment resulting in errors and artefacts on spectral and modal plots. A noise model is essential, because it determines the signal to noise ratio needed to ensure a given level of experimental fidelity.

Title: Universality and anisotropy of the Photonic Urbach Tail
Authors: M. Menéndez, Lan Hoang Mai, Nazifa Tasnim Arony, Henry Carfagno, Lauren N. McCabe, Joshua M. O. Zide, Cefe López, Matthew F. Doty, P. D. García
Abstract: Disorder in photonic crystals and waveguides creates states inside the photonic band gap. These states are often described as Lifshitz tails despite exhibiting energy distributions inconsistent with Lifshitz statistics near the band edge. Here we show that in photonic-crystal waveguides with intentionally engineered anisotropic disorder, the band-edge tail accessible experimentally follows an Urbach law universally, with cumulative statistics $F(\Delta)=\exp[-(\Delta/\alpha)^\beta]$, where $\Delta$ is the spectral detuning from the band edge, and an exponent $\beta \approx 1$ independent of disorder strength and orientation. In contrast to Lifshitz behavior, the density of states is maximal at the band edge and decays into the gap. Crucially, we find that the Urbach energy $\alpha$ is anisotropic, with a pronounced directional splitting and qualitatively different scaling for disorder parallel and perpendicular to the waveguide axis. These conclusions are supported by quantitative agreement between optical measurements of GaAs photonic-crystal waveguides and full-vector simulations. The anisotropic Urbach energy emerges as a sensitive probe of disorder-mode coupling and a practical metric to characterize structural disorder in photonic devices.

Title: Efficient and tunable narrowband second-harmonic generation by a large-area etchless lithium niobate metasurface
Authors: Yaping Hou, Yigong Luan, Yu Fan, Alfonso Nardi, Attilio Zilli, Bobo Du, Jinyou Shao, Marco Finazzi, Chunhui Wang, Lei Zhang, Michele Celebrano
Abstract: Optical resonances in nanostructures enable strong enhancement of nonlinear processes at the nanoscale, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), with high-$Q$ modes providing intensified light--matter interactions and sharp spectral selectivity for applications in filtering, sensing, and nonlinear spectroscopy. Thanks to the recent advances in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) technology, these key features can be now translated to lithium niobate for realizing novel nanoscale nonlinear optical platforms. Here, we demonstrate a large-area metasurface, realized by scalable nanoimprint lithography, comprising a slanted titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) nanograting on etchless TFLN for efficient narrowband SHG. This is enabled by the optimal coupling of quasi-bound state in the continuum (q-BIC) modes with a narrowband pulsed laser pump. The demonstrated normalized SHG efficiency is $0.15\%\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{GW}$, which is among the largest reported for LN metasurfaces. The low pump peak intensity ($3.64~\mathrm{kW}/\mathrm{cm}^2$) employed, which enables SHG even by continuous-wave pumping, allows envisioning integrated and portable photonic applications. SHG wavelength tuning from $870$ to $920~\mathrm{nm}$ with stable output power as well as polarization control is also achieved by off-normal pump illumination. This versatile platform opens new opportunities for sensing, THz generation and detection, and ultrafast electro-optic modulation of nonlinear optical signals. Se vuoi, posso anche:

Title: Replica Phase Transition with Quantum Gravity Corrections
Authors: Jun Nian, Yuan Zhong
Abstract: Motivated by bulk replica wormholes, we study the boundary effective theory that describes the near-horizon fluctuations of a near-extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole. This theory consists of a Schwarzian mode and a $U(1)$ phase mode. We compute the partition function of this boundary theory on replica geometries, from which the entropy is derived. Our analysis reveals a rich phase structure, in which the dominance of connected or disconnected replica configurations leads to a phase transition controlled by the temperature and the coupling constants $C$, $K$, and $\mathcal{E}$ of the 1d effective theory.

Title: The Intrinsic Connection between Dynamical Phase Transitions and Magnetization in the 1D XY Model
Authors: Lin-Yue Luo, Wei-Lin Li, Bao-Ming Xu, Zhi Li
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study the quench dynamics of a transverse-field XY model starting from coherent Gibbs states. The results reveal that the initial strength of magnetization plays a crucial role in the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transitions. In concrete terms, when quenching within the same phase, through the properties of observables such as Fisher zeros and magnetization, we show that the stronger the initial magnetization, the more difficult the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transitions. The underlying mechanism is that the strong initial magnetization provides a directional effect, which inhibits the spin flipping in the process of quantum quench, making the dynamical quantum phase transition difficult to emerge. Since dynamical quantum phase transitions can be experimentally realized in various artificial systems, we hope that the physics predicted here can be experimentally verified in tabletop platforms.

Title: Spectroscopic Signatures of a Liouvillian Exceptional Spectral Phase in a Collective Spin
Authors: Rafael A. Molina
Abstract: Non-Hermitian degeneracies of Lindblad generators (Liouvillian exceptional points) can induce non-exponential relaxation and higher-order poles in dynamical response functions. A collective spin coupled to a polarized Markovian bath exhibits an \emph{exceptional spectral phase} in which defective Liouvillian modes imprint super-Lorentzian features in frequency-resolved spectra. We compute the emission spectrum via the Liouvillian resolvent, identify symmetry-sector selection rules, and demonstrate that exceptional-point signatures are strongly state-dependent: they are suppressed in steady-state fluorescence yet become unambiguous for generic (infinite-temperature or random) initial states. Our results provide an experimentally accessible spectroscopic diagnostic of many-body Liouvillian exceptional phases and clarify when steady-state emission can (and cannot) reveal them.

Title: General teleparallel geometric theory of defects
Authors: Muzaffer Adak, Ertan Kok, Mehmet Orhan
Abstract: We revisit the geometric theory of defects. In the differential-geometric models of defects that have been adopted since the 1950s, dislocations have been associated with torsion, disclinations with the full curvature, and point defects with the first kind trace of non-metricity. The mainstream formulation exhibits several conceptual and technical shortcomings, most notably a hierarchy inconsistency, the non-exictence of a genuine metric formulation, and the potential emergence of Ostrogradsky-type instabilities. These issues have motivated us to develop a new framework, namely a generalized teleparallel geometric theory of defects. In our model, dislocations are identified with the trace of torsion, disclinations with the second kind trace of the non-metricity, and point defects with the first kind trace of the non-metricity. In addition, we retain the scalar part torsion as a free parameter for describing some possible unknown degrees of freedom in the theory of defects. The proposed geometric theory of defects is free from all of the aforementioned drawbacks and is therefore worthy of further investigation. To ensure the coherence and completeness of the discussion, we begin our analysis with elastic deformations, then summarize the existing metric-affine geometric theory of defects, and finally proceed to our original contribution, namely the new theory introduced here. We formulate the entire theory in Eulerian coordinates. Naturally, all results can be reformulated in Lagrangian coordinates as well. All analyses and formulae are expressed in the language of exterior algebra and are carried out in coordinate-independent orthonormal frames.

Title: Many-body localization for the random XXZ spin chain in fixed energy intervals
Authors: Alexander Elgart, Abel Klein
Abstract: A key signature of MBL (many-body localization) is the slow rate at which information spreads. It is shown that the infinite random Heisenberg XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain exhibits slow propagation of information (logarithmic light cone) in any arbitrary but fixed energy interval. The relevant parameter regime, which covers both weak interaction and strong disorder, is determined solely by the energy interval.

Title: Multipartite entanglement characterizing topological phase transitions in holographic nodal line semimetals
Authors: Xiantong Chen, Xuanting Ji, Ya-Wen Sun
Abstract: Topological states of matter are characterized by nonlocal structures that are naturally encoded in the quantum entanglement of many-body wavefunctions. Topological semimetals are short-range entangled states at weak coupling and their entanglement structure at strong coupling remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the multipartite entanglement structure of strongly coupled holographic nodal line semimetals. Building on previous studies of entanglement entropy and the holographic c-function, we focus on multipartite entanglement measures, including the conditional mutual information, multi-entropy, and the Markov gap which is based on the entanglement wedge cross section. Our results demonstrate that while these multipartite measures vanish in the long-distance limit $l \to \infty$, which confirms that the holographic nodal line semimetal remains a short-range entangled state, their large $l$ scaling behavior remains highly sensitive to the underlying topology. The large $l$ power-law decay and scaling exponents serve as robust, non-local order parameters that exhibit sharp changes at the quantum critical point. This work establishes multi-partite entanglement as a powerful probe of quantum topological phase transitions in strongly coupled topological systems.

Title: Physics Informed Generative AI Enabling Labour Free Segmentation For Microscopy Analysis
Authors: Salma Zahran, Zhou Ao, Zhengyang Zhang, Chen Chi, Chenchen Yuan, Yanming Wang
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of microscopy images is a critical task for high-throughput materials characterisation, yet its automation is severely constrained by the prohibitive cost, subjectivity, and scarcity of expert-annotated data. While physics-based simulations offer a scalable alternative to manual labelling, models trained on such data historically fail to generalise due to a significant domain gap, lacking the complex textures, noise patterns, and imaging artefacts inherent to experimental data. This paper introduces a novel framework for labour-free segmentation that successfully bridges this simulation-to-reality gap. Our pipeline leverages phase-field simulations to generate an abundant source of microstructural morphologies with perfect, intrinsically-derived ground-truth masks. We then employ a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) for unpaired image-to-image translation, transforming the clean simulations into a large-scale dataset of high-fidelity, realistic SEM images. A U-Net model, trained exclusively on this synthetic data, demonstrated remarkable generalisation when deployed on unseen experimental images, achieving a mean Boundary F1-Score of 0.90 and an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.88. Comprehensive validation using t-SNE feature-space projection and Shannon entropy analysis confirms that our synthetic images are statistically and featurally indistinguishable from the real data manifold. By completely decoupling model training from manual annotation, our generative framework transforms a data-scarce problem into one of data abundance, providing a robust and fully automated solution to accelerate materials discovery and analysis.

Title: Machine learning determines the Mg2SiO4 P-T phase diagram
Authors: Siyu Zhou, Daohong Liu, Chuanyu Zhang, Yu He, Xuben Wang, Xiaopan Zuo
Abstract: Phase transitions among Mg2SiO4 and its high-pressure polymorphs (wadsleyite and ringwoodite) are central to mantle dynamics and deep-mantle material cycling. However, the locations and Pressure-Temperature (P-T) dependences of these phase boundaries remain debated, largely due to experimental limitations at extreme conditions and the high computational cost of first-principles free-energy calculations. Here, a machine-learning-potential driven workflow combining non-equilibrium thermodynamic integration (NETI) and two-phase coexistence simulations is employed to enable large-scale, long-timescale molecular dynamics sampling. Within this workflow, the melting curve of forsterite is evaluated and a complete P-T phase diagram is constructed. Relative to conventional ab initio approaches, this strategy reduces computational expense while retaining thermodynamic consistency in phase-stability assessment. The workflow is applicable to efficient evaluation of phase stability and thermodynamic properties in deep-Earth silicate systems.

Title: Semidefinite programming for understanding limitations of Lindblad equations
Authors: Soumyadeep Sarma, Manas Kulkarni, Archak Purkayastha, Devashish Tupkary
Abstract: Lindbladian quantum master equations (LEs) are the most popular descriptions for quantum systems weakly coupled to baths. But, recent works have established that in many situations such Markovian descriptions are fundamentally limited: they cannot simultaneously capture populations and coherences even to the leading-order in system-bath couplings. This can cause violation of fundamental properties like thermalization and continuity equations associated with local conservation laws, even when such properties are expected in the actual setting. This begs the question: given a physical situation, how do we know if there exists an LE that describes it to a desired accuracy? Here we show that, for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), this question can be succinctly formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP), a convex optimization technique. If a solution to the SDP can be found to a desired accuracy, then an LE description is possible for the chosen setting. If not, no LE description is fundamentally attainable, showing that a consistent Markovian treatment is impossible even at weak system-bath coupling for that particular setting. Considering few qubit isotropic XXZ-type models coupled to multiple baths, we find that in most parameter regimes, LE description giving accurate populations and coherences to leading-order is unattainable, leading to rigorous no-go results. However, in some cases, LE description having correct populations but inaccurate coherences, and satisfying local conservation laws, is possible over some of the parameter regimes. Our work highlights the power of semidefinite programming in the analysis of physically consistent LEs, thereby, in understanding the limits of Markovian descriptions at weak system-bath couplings.

Title: Finite-Size Scaling of the Full Eigenstate Thermalization in Quantum Spin Chains
Authors: Yuke Zhang, Pengfei Zhang
Abstract: Despite the unitary evolution of closed quantum systems, long-time expectation of local observables are well described by thermal ensembles, providing the foundation of quantum statistical mechanics. A promising route to understanding this quantum thermalization is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which posits that individual energy eigenstates already appear locally thermal. Subsequent studies have extended this concept to the full ETH, which captures higher-order correlations among matrix elements through nontrivial relations. In this work, we perform a detailed exact-diagonalization study of finite-size corrections to these relations in the canonical ensemble. We distinguish two distinct sources of corrections: those arising from energy fluctuations, which decay polynomially with system size, and those originating from fluctuations within each energy window, which decay exponentially with system size. In particular, our analysis resolves the puzzle that, for certain observables, finite-size corrections exhibit anomalous growth with increasing system size even in chaotic systems. Our results provide a systematic and practical methodology for validating the full ETH in quantum many-body systems.

Title: Universal scaling of finite-temperature quantum adiabaticity in driven many-body systems

Abstract: Establishing quantitative adiabaticity criteria at finite temperature remains substantially less developed than in the pure-state setting, despite the fact that realistic quantum systems are never at absolute zero. Here we derive rigorous bounds on the Hilbert-Schmidt fidelity between mixed states by combining a mixed-state quantum speed limit with mixed-state fidelity susceptibility within the Liouville space formulation of quantum mechanics. Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature. We verify the predicted scaling in several spin-1/2 chains by obtaining closed-form expressions for the threshold driving rate. Our results provide practical and largely model-independent criteria for finite-temperature adiabaticity in closed many-body systems.

Title: Shear subdiffusion in non-relativistic holography
Authors: Yan Liu, Zhi-Ling Wang, Xin-Meng Wu
Abstract: We study shear fluctuations in non-relativistic holographic systems coupled to torsional Newton-Cartan geometry, using asymptotically Lifshitz spacetimes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity. We identify a universal subdiffusive shear mode characterized by the quartic dispersion relation $\omega=-iD_4 k^4$, in sharp contrast to the conventional hydrodynamic diffusion. We derive this result analytically through a systematic higher-order matched asymptotic expansion connecting near-horizon and far-region solutions, and we verify it with direct numerical quasinormal mode calculations. Our numerics demonstrate that the first non-hydrodynamic mode is purely imaginary and gapped, following the dispersion relation $\omega=-i\omega_0-i D k^2$, and that both the hydrodynamic and the first non-hydrodynamic modes pass through pole-skipping points. These results highlight Lifshitz holography as an efficient framework for anomalous transport in strongly coupled non-relativistic quantum matter.

Title: The soliton nature of the super-Klein tunneling effect
Authors: Francisco Correa, Luis Inzunza, Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: We establish a relationship between the Davey--Stewartson II (DS II) integrable system in $(2{+}1)$ dimensions and quasi-exactly solvable planar interacting Dirac Hamiltonians that exhibit the super-Klein tunneling (SKT) effect. The Dirac interactions are constructed from the real and imaginary parts of breather solutions of the DS II system. In this framework, the SKT effect arises when the energy is tuned to match the constant background of the soliton, while the resulting Dirac Hamiltonians simultaneously support bound states embedded in the continuum. By imposing the SKT boundary conditions, we employ Darboux transformations to construct a general three-parameter family of DS II breather solutions that can be mapped to Dirac Hamiltonians. At the initial soliton time, the corresponding Dirac systems form a massless two-parameter family of Hermitian models with nontrivial electrostatic potentials. As the soliton time evolves, the systems become $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and develop a nontrivial imaginary mass term. Finally, when the soliton time is taken to be imaginary, the construction yields Hermitian Dirac systems that lack time-reversal symmetry. In all cases, we identify the emergence of quasi-symmetry transformations that preserve the SKT subspace of states while not commuting with the full Hamiltonian.

Title: A Schwinger-Keldysh Formulation of Semiclassical Operator Dynamics
Authors: Jeff Murugan, Hendrik J. R. van Zyl
Abstract: In this work we develop a real-time Schwinger-Keldysh formulation of Krylov dynamics that treats Krylov complexity as an in-in observable generated by a closed time contour path integral. The resulting generating functional exposes an emergent phase-space description in which the Lanczos coefficients define an effective Hamiltonian governing operator motion along the Krylov chain. In the semiclassical limit, exponential complexity growth arises from hyperbolic trajectories, and asymptotically linear Lanczos growth appears as a universal chaotic fixed point, with sub-leading deformations classified as irrelevant, marginal or relevant. Going beyond the saddle, the Schwinger-Keldysh framework provides controlled access to fluctuations and large deviations of Krylov complexity, revealing sharp signatures of integrability-chaos crossovers that are invisible at the level of the mean. This formulation reorganises Krylov complexity into a dynamical field-theoretic framework and identifies new fluctuation diagnostics of operator growth in closed quantum systems.

Title: Electrically tunable dipolar polaritons with giant nonlinearity in a homobilayer microcavity
Authors: Baixu Xiang, Yubin Wang, Guihan Wen, Yitong Li, Hao Wen, Zengde She, Haiyun Liu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Timothy C. H. Liew, Zhiyuan Sun, Qihua Xiong
Abstract: Active control over strong optical nonlinearity in solid-state systems is central to unlocking exotic many-body phenomena and scalable photonic devices. While exciton-polaritons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer a promising platform, their practical utility is often impeded by fixed interaction parameters and an intrinsic trade-off between nonlinearity and oscillator strength. Here, we report electrically tunable dipolar polaritons in a dual-gated bilayer MoS2 microcavity, demonstrating in situ reshaping of the dispersion and modulation of the light-matter coupling strength via the quantum-confined Stark effect. Crucially, this architecture enables a giant polariton-polariton interaction strength tunable by a factor of seven. This nonlinearity enhancement arises from a synergistic interplay, in which the electric field amplifies the microscopic dipolar repulsion while simultaneously optimizing the macroscopic excitonic Hopfield coefficient. Furthermore, electrostatic doping serves as an independent control knob to switch the system between strong and weak coupling regimes. Our findings bridge the gap between strong optical coupling and giant dipolar nonlinearities, establishing the TMD homobilayer as a versatile platform for engineering programmable correlated many-body states on a chip.

Title: Numerically optimized FROG results for the study of red-shifted spectra in multi-frequency Raman generation
Authors: Sakthi Priya Amirtharaj, Zujun Xu, Donna Strickland, Borun Chowdhury, Sagnik Acharya, Priyam Samantray, Anil Prabhakar, Kisor Kumar Sahu, Franz Bamer, S. Swayamjyoti
Abstract: When multifrequency Raman scattering is driven in the transient regime by two chirped pump pulses, the resulting anti-Stokes orders exhibit asymmetric spectral broadening toward lower frequencies, leading to a characteristic double-peaked structure in each order. In this Letter, frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) is used to investigate the spectral evolution of the first anti-Stokes Raman component. To interpret the observed features, we introduce a double-pulse interference model and employ an adaptive learning-based reconstruction algorithm using the Adam optimizer to retrieve the temporal field evolution. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental measurements. Our analysis indicates that the observed red-shifted spectral component originates from linear Raman processes within the two-photon dressed-state framework.

Title: A Diffuse-Interface Method for Pore Dynamics in Lipid Membranes under Electric Fields
Authors: Saman Seifi, David Salac
Abstract: We develop a diffuse-interface continuum model for membrane electroporation that couples a phase field for pore geometry to a quasi-static electrolyte potential and a spatially varying leaky-dielectric model for the transmembrane voltage. The main contribution is a stabilized time-integration strategy for transmembrane voltage $V_m$: the stiff leakage term is treated implicitly while the electrolyte-to-membrane ionic current is lagged, yielding a closed-form update that removes the restriction imposed by the fast dielectric relaxation time. The electrolyte potential is computed efficiently using a semi-analytical spectral Laplace solver: a 2D DCT in the membrane plane reduces the 3D problem to independent 1D ODEs in $z$, solved in closed form and reconstructed by an inverse transform. The coupled method is robust under grid refinement, reproduces the sharp-interface critical-radius bifurcation, and captures electric-field focusing through conductive pores. We also demonstrate stochastic pore nucleation by adding thermal noise to the phase-field dynamics, enabling fully emergent electroporation events without prescribing initial defects.

Title: Aspect-ratio-dependent void formation in active rhomboidal and elliptical particle systems
Authors: Motoya Suzaka, Hiroaki Ito, Hiroyuki Kitahata
Abstract: We execute a numerical simulation on active nematics with particles interacting by an excluded volume effect. The systems with rhomboidal particles and that with elliptical particles are considered in order to investigate the effect of the direct contact of particles. In our simulation, the void regions, where the local number density is almost zero, appear in both systems when the aspect ratio of the particles is high. We focused on the relationship between the void regions and the particle orientation of the bulk. The particle number density, particle orientation, topological defects, and void regions are analyzed for different aspect ratios in both systems. The systems with rhomboidal particles have characteristic void sizes, which increase with an increase in the aspect ratio. In contrast, the distribution of the void-region size in the systems with elliptical particles is broad. The present results suggest that the void size in the systems with rhomboidal particles is determined by the correlation length of the particle orientational field around the void regions, while that might be determined by the system size in the systems with elliptical particles.

Title: Multifractality in critical neural field dynamics
Authors: Merlin Dumeur, Sheng H. Wang, J. Matias Palva, Philippe Ciuciu
Abstract: The brain criticality hypothesis has largely only characterized brain dynamics in terms of their self-similarity, although experimental evidence suggests that the brain exhibits significant multifractality. To understand how multifractality may emerge in critical-like systems modeling neuronal activity, we used a neural field model exhibiting neural oscillations and a critical phase transition. We find that multifractality emerges near a synchronization phase transition, and that the pattern of variation of multifractality changes when placing the model at a different phase transition. These findings show that multifractality in temporal dynamics emerges near criticality in neural fields, providing a formal basis for interpreting multifractality in brain recordings.

Title: Thermodynamic Space of Chemical Reaction Networks
Authors: Shiling Liang, Paolo De Los Rios, Daniel Maria Busiello
Abstract: Living systems operate out of equilibrium, continuously consuming energy to sustain organised, functional states. Their emergent behaviour usually relies on a set of interconnected chemical reaction networks (CRNs) driven by external fluxes that keep some species at fixed concentrations. Hence, uncovering the principles governing the functioning of these CRNs is crucial to understand how living systems generate and regulate complexity. While kinetics plays a key role in shaping detailed dynamical phenomena, the range of operations of a CRN is fundamentally constrained by thermodynamics. Here, we introduce and analytically derive the "thermodynamic space" of a CRN, i.e., the range of accessible stationary concentrations that can be realized under a given energetic budget. We establish analogous bounds for reaction affinities, shedding light on how global thermodynamic properties, such as the total non-equilibrium driving, can limit local non-equilibrium quantities. We illustrate our results in various paradigmatic examples, demonstrating how the onset of complex behaviors is intimately tangled with the presence of non-equilibrium conditions. By providing a general tool for analysing CRNs, the presented framework constitutes a stepping stone to deepen our ability to predict complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena and design artificial chemical systems, starting from the sole knowledge of the underlying thermodynamic properties.

Title: Optical control of spin-splitting in an altermagnet
Authors: Sangeeta Rajpurohit, Revsen Karaalp, Yuan Ping, Liang Z. Tan, Tadashi Ogitsu, Peter E. Blöchl
Abstract: Manipulating and controlling the band structure and the spin-splitting in the newly discovered class of magnetic materials known as 'altermagnets' is highly desirable for their application in spintronics. Based on real-time simulations for an interacting multiband tight-binding model, we propose optical excitations as an effective way to selectively control the spin-splitting of an altermagnet. The consistent treatment of electronic interactions and electron-phonon coupling in the model allows for a systematic study of the effect of these interactions on the spin-splitting of the altermagnet in the ground as well as in the excited-state. Our simulations reveal that optical excitations modify the band structure and thus lead to significant changes in the spin-splitting within 50 fs. The relative spin-splitting in the conduction band grows up to four times in the optically excited altermagnet. We disentangle the roles of Coulomb $U$ and $J$ in the enhancement of the spin-splitting in the photoexcited state. Our study elucidates the potential for exploiting optical control of spin-splitting gaps to obtain desirable properties in altermagnets on the fastest possible timescales.

Title: Active Screws: Emergent Active Chiral Nematics of Spinning Self-Propelled Rods
Authors: Debarghya Banerjee, Lauritz Hahn, Ricard Alert
Abstract: Several types of active agents self-propel by spinning around their propulsion axis, thus behaving as active screws. Examples include cytoskeletal filaments in gliding assays, magnetically-driven colloidal helices, and microorganisms like the soil bacterium $\it{M. xanthus}$. Here, we develop a model for spinning self-propelled rods on a substrate, and we coarse-grain it to derive the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. If the rods propel purely along their axis, they form an active nematic at high density and activity. However, spinning rods can also roll sideways as they move. We find that this transverse motion turns the system into a chiral active nematic. Thus, we identify a mechanism whereby individual chirality can give rise to collective chiral flows. Finally, we analyze experiments on $\it{M. xanthus}$ colonies to show that they exhibit chiral flows around topological defects, with a chiral activity about an order of magnitude weaker than the achiral one. Our work reveals the collective behavior of active screws, which is relevant to colonies of social bacteria and groups of unicellular parasites.

Title: A continuous symmetry breaking measure for finite clusters using Jensen-Shannon divergence
Authors: Ling Lan, Qiang Du, Simon J. L. Billinge
Abstract: A quantitative measure of symmetry breaking is introduced that allows the quantification of which symmetries are most strongly broken due to the introduction of some kind of defect in a perfect structure. The method uses a statistical approach based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The measure is calculated by comparing the transformed atomic density function with its original. Software code is presented that carries the calculations out numerically using Monte Carlo methods. The behavior of this symmetry breaking measure is tested for various cases including finite size crystallites (where the surfaces break the crystallographic symmetry), atomic displacements from high symmetry positions, and collective motions of atoms due to rotations of rigid octahedra. The approach provides a powerful tool for assessing local symmetry breaking and offers new insights that can help researchers understand how different structural distortions affect different symmetry operations.

Title: Specific heat of Gd$^{3+}$ and Eu$^{2+}$-based magnetic compounds
Authors: D. J. Garcia, J. G. Sereni, A. A. Aligia
Abstract: We have studied theoretically the specific heat of a large number of non-frustrated magnetic structures described by the Heisenberg model for systems with total angular momentum $J=7/2$, corresponding to the 4f$^7$ configuration of Gd$^{+3}$ and Eu$^{+2}$. For a given critical temperature (determined by the magnitude of the exchange interactions), we find that, to a high degree of accuracy, the specific heat is governed by two primary parameters: the effective number of neighbors $z$, which dictates the extent of spatial and quantum fluctuations, and the axial anisotropy $K$. The universality of $z$ (its ability to describe specific heat across diverse lattices) holds robustly for systems where exchange interactions do not strongly increase with distance and in the absence of frustration. Otherwise, deviations from universality emerge. Using these two parameters we fit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds, achieving a remarkable agreement. The present approach enables the extraction of magnetic interaction parameters not accessible through mean-field theory, offering a powerful tool for interpreting specific heat data in 4f$^7$ systems.

Title: Boundary topological orders of (4+1)d fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\mathrm{F}}$ SPT states
Authors: Meng Cheng, Juven Wang, Xinping Yang
Abstract: We investigate (3+1)d topological orders in fermionic systems with an anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\mathrm{F}}$ symmetry, where its $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}$ subgroup is the fermion parity. Such an anomalous symmetry arises as the discrete subgroup of the chiral U(1) symmetry of $\nu$ copies of Weyl fermions of the same chirality. Inspired by the crystalline correspondence principle, we deform the anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^\mathrm{F}$ symmetry of (3+1)d Weyl fermion to the anomalous $C_N \times \mathbb{Z}_2^\mathrm{F}$ symmetry. Then we microscopically construct symmetry-preserving gapped boundary states of the closely-related (4+1)d $C_N\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state (with $C_N$ being the $N$-fold rotation), whenever it is possible. In particular, for $\nu=N$, we show that the (3+1)d symmetric gapped state admits a topological $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory description at low energy, and propose that a similar theory saturates the corresponding $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^\mathrm{F}$ anomaly. For $N \nmid \nu$, our construction admits no topological quantum field theory (TQFT) symmetric gapped state; while for $\nu=N/2$, we find a non-TQFT symmetric gapped state via stacking lower-dimensional (2+1)d non-discrete-gauge-theory topological order inhomogeneously. For other values of $\nu$, no symmetric gapped state is possible within our construction, which is consistent with the no-go theorem by Cordova-Ohmori.

Title: How glass breaks -- Damage explains the difference between surface and fracture energies in amorphous silica
Authors: Gergely Molnár, Etienne Barthel
Abstract: The difference between free surface energy and fracture toughness in amorphous silica is studied via multi-scale simulations. We combine the homogenization of a molecular dynamics fracture model with a phase-field approach to track and quantify the various energy contributions. We clearly separate free surface energy localized as potential energy on the surface and damage diffusion over a 16-23 A range around the crack path. The plastic contribution is negligible. These findings, which clarify brittle fracture mechanisms in amorphous materials, align with toughness measurements in silica.

Title: Design of magnonic waveguides using surface anisotropy-induced Bragg mirrors
Authors: Grzegorz Centała, Jarosław W. Kłos
Abstract: Waveguides are fundamental components for signal transmission in integrated wave-based processing systems. In this paper, we address the challenges in designing magnonic waveguides, including limitations such as non-uniform demagnetizing fields, reduced group velocity, and restricted operating frequency ranges. We propose a magnonic waveguide design with promising properties that overcome these limitations to a significant extent. Specifically, we investigate a waveguide formed within a uniform ferromagnetic layer (Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$) by applying surface anisotropy in strip regions, thereby creating Bragg mirror structures to confine spin waves and guide them along a single direction. The proposed waveguide enables the propagation of high-frequency spin waves with high velocities in the ferromagnetic layer while minimizing static demagnetizing effects. We developed a model that allows for spin-wave confinement and guidance in two perpendicular directions by spatially modulating the surface anisotropy. The theoretical model was solved using the finite element method to calculate the dispersion relations of the waveguide modes and analyze their spatial profiles. Additionally, we determine the group velocity and localization characteristics, providing a comprehensive understanding of the waveguide's performance.

Title: Topological advantage for adsorbate chemisorption on conjugated chains
Authors: Raphael F. Ribeiro, Luis Martinez-Gomez
Abstract: Topological matter offers opportunities for control of charge and energy flow with implications for chemistry still incompletely understood. In this work, we study an ensemble of adsorbates with an empty frontier level (LUMO) coupled to the edges, domain walls (solitons), and bulk of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger polyacetylene chain across its trivial insulator, metallic, and topological insulator phases. We find that two experimentally relevant observables, charge donation into the LUMO and the magnitude of adsorbate electronic friction, are significantly impacted by the electronic phase of the SSH chain and show clear signatures of the topological phase transition. Localized, symmetry-protected midgap states at edges and solitons strongly enhance electron donation relative to both the metallic and trivial phases, whereas by contrast, the metal's extended states, despite larger total DOS near the Fermi energy, hybridize more weakly with a molecular adsorbate near a particular site. Electronic friction is largest in the metal, strongly suppressed in gapped regions, and intermediate at topological edges where hybridization splits the midgap resonance. These trends persist with disorder highlighting their robustness and suggest engineering domain walls and topological boundaries as pathways for employing topological matter in molecular catalysis and sensing.

Title: A mean-field theory for heterogeneous random growth with redistribution
Authors: Maximilien Bernard, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Pierre Le Doussal
Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.

Title: Fractional Chern Insulator and Quantum Anomalous Hall Crystal in Twisted MoTe$_2$
Authors: Jialin Chen, Qiaoyi Li, Xiaoyu Wang, Wei Li
Abstract: Recent experimental advances have uncovered fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in twisted MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) systems under zero magnetic field. Understanding the interaction effects on topological phases within realistic model presents a significant theoretical challenge. Here, we construct a moiré superlattice model tailored for tMoTe$_2$ and conduct investigations using state-of-the-art tensor-network methods. Our ground-state calculations reveal a rich variety of interaction-driven and filling-dependent topological phases, including FCIs, Chern insulators, and generalized Wigner crystals, which are revealed in recent experiments. For FCI state, dynamical simulations uncover a single-particle excitation continuum with a finite charge gap, reflecting the fractionalized charge excitations. Finite-temperature calculations further determine characteristic charge activation and ferromagnetic transition temperatures, reconciling existing experimental discrepancies. Furthermore, using this realistic lattice model, we predict the presence of quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibiting integer Hall conductivity at fractional fillings in tMoTe$_2$. By integrating ground-state, finite-temperature, and dynamical analyses, our work establishes a comprehensive framework for understanding correlated topological phases in tMoTe$_2$ and related moiré systems.

Title: Molecular dynamics simulation of silicon nanoparticle crystallization during laser-induced forward transfer printing
Authors: Youwen Liang, Wan Shou
Abstract: Laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) printing is a versatile technique to realize micro/nano-scale additive manufacturing of functional materials, including metals and semiconductors. However, the crystallization phenomena during LIFT printing have not been well understood, which is critical to determine the resulting microstructure and properties. In this work, we systematically investigate silicon crystallization during LIFT printing using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Specifically, MD simulation with Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential is used to investigate the size effect and surface influence on the crystallization of Si nanoparticles during transportation in air. We found that with a decrease in nanoparticle size, crystallization becomes increasingly rare, even at low cooling rates. The nucleation location of different particles is also analyzed and almost always starts at a sub-surface location (below 5 Å). The evolution of the atomic structure during solidification is also monitored to guide LIFT printing of Si. Our simulation results indicate that nano-confinement induced by the surface layer can lead to single-crystal structure formation, which may shed light on additive manufacturing of single-crystal structures and devices.

Abstract: We develop a tensor network-based method for calculating disorder-averaged expectation values in random spin chains without having to explicitly sample over disorder configurations. The algorithm exploits statistical translation invariance and works directly in the thermodynamic limit. We benchmark our method on the infinite-randomness critical point of the random transverse field Ising model.

Title: Coexisting topological hinges and 1D Rashba states in Bi$_{0.97}$Sb$_{0.03}$ revealed by the Josephson effect
Authors: Biplab Bhattacharyya, Stijn R. de Wit, Zhen Wu, Yingkai Huang, Mark S. Golden, Alexander Brinkman, Chuan Li
Abstract: Second-order topological insulating (SOTI) states in three-dimensional materials are helical one-dimensional hinge states. Inducing superconductivity in these states leads to gapless bound states, characterized by the 4$\pi$-periodic current-phase relation. Here, we provide evidence of the topologically protected hinge states in Dirac semimetal Bi$_{0.97}$Sb$_{0.03}$ nanoflakes by an unconventional interference pattern in a magnetic field, and the 4$\pi$-periodic supercurrent carried by these states via the suppressed first and third Shapiro steps. Tight-binding simulations confirm the presence of multiple hinge modes, supporting our interpretation of Bi$_{0.97}$Sb$_{0.03}$ as a prototypical designable SOTI platform. Quantum confinement effect is identified by a quasi-one-dimensional bulk transport, and the confined Rashba states are responsible for the broadened hinge states.

Title: Dominant orbital magnetization in the prototypical altermagnet MnTe
Authors: Chao Chen Ye, Karma Tenzin, Jagoda Sławińska, Carmine Autieri
Abstract: Altermagnetism is an unconventional form of antiferromagnetism characterized by momentum-dependent spin polarization of electronic states and zero net magnetization, arising from specific crystalline symmetries. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and broken time-reversal symmetry, altermagnets can exhibit finite net magnetization and anomalous Hall effect (AHE), phenomena typically associated with ferromagnets. Due to the dependence of AHE on magnetization, understanding the interplay between spin and orbital contributions to magnetization is essential for interpreting experiments and designing altermagnetic devices. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the intrinsic spin and orbital magnetization of the magnetic ground state of the prototypical altermagnet {\alpha}-MnTe. We find that SOC induces weak ferromagnetism through spin canting, accompanied by a slight in-plane rotation of the Néel vector. Notably, we identify a significant net orbital magnetization of 0.176 {\mu}B per unit cell oriented along the z-axis, while the spin magnetization in the same direction is much smaller at 0.002 {\mu}B. By varying the chemical potential, we show that the spin magnetization is tunable through hole doping, whereas the orbital magnetization remains robust against carrier density changes. These results highlight the important role of orbital magnetization and establish its relevance for orbital-based phenomena in altermagnets.

Title: Magnetic correlations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities
Authors: Zheng Wei, Yanmei Cai, Boyang Wen, Tianxing Ma
Abstract: Higher-order Van Hove singularities in strongly correlated electron systems provide a fertile ground for emergent electronic orders and superconductivity. This study investigates the interplay between magnetic fluctuations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities on the honeycomb lattice, a paradigmatic platform relevant to graphene. By incorporating third-nearest-neighbor hopping \(t''\), we uncover a universal crossover: ferromagnetic fluctuations dominate below the higher-order Van Hove filling, while antiferromagnetic fluctuations take over toward half filling. A key finding is that the already dominant \(f_n\)-wave pairing is enhanced in the critical region of this magnetic crossover by the higher-order Van Hove. This enhancement is driven by the synergistic effect of the higher-order Van Hove singularities-induced divergent density of states and the competing magnetic fluctuations. Although increased hopping parameters generally suppress superconducting correlation, we identify a critical \(t''\) that anomalously enhances pairing via the higher-order Van Hove renormalization. Furthermore, the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction suppresses the pairing correlation function in a sign-independent manner. Our results clarify the competitive mechanisms between magnetic fluctuations and unconventional superconductivity in higher-order Van Hove singularities systems, offering a theoretical basis for tailoring quantum phases in graphene-based materials via band engineering.

Title: Dimer-projection contact and the clock shift of a unitary Fermi gas
Authors: Kevin G. S. Xie, Colin J. Dale, Kiera Pond Grehan, Maggie Fen Wang, Tilman Enss, Paul S. Julienne, Zhenhua Yu, Joseph H. Thywissen
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of short-range correlations is a central challenge in strongly interacting Fermi gases. In ultracold gases, these correlations are quantified by the contact parameter, yet measurements to date have been limited to equilibrium systems or relatively slow, global dynamics. Here, we introduce a rapid spectroscopic technique based on projection of the interacting state onto an alternate scattering channel with a low-lying dimer state. We demonstrate contact measurements on the microsecond timescale -- faster than the inverse Fermi energy. Using $^{40}$K near a broad $s$-wave Feshbach resonance, we show that the strength of the dimer-projection feature scales proportionally with the contact parameter extracted from the high-frequency tail of radio-frequency spectroscopy, in agreement with coupled-channels calculations. Analysis of the spectra further reveals that the dimer feature provides the dominant contribution to the clock shift of the unitary Fermi gas, allowing the first experimental bound on this quantity. The observed deviations from universal predictions highlight the importance of multichannel effects. Our results open new avenues for studying contact correlators, hydrodynamic attractors, and quantum critical behavior.

Title: Josephson wormhole in coupled superconducting Yukawa-SYK metals
Authors: Aravindh S. Shankar, Jasper Steenbergen, Stephan Plugge, Koenraad Schalm
Abstract: We show that two Yukawa-SYK models with a weak tunneling contact can have an exotic hybrid superconducting thermofield-double-like state that is holographically dual to a traversable wormhole connecting two black holes with charged scalar hair. The hybrid superconducting thermo-field-double/wormhole state is distinguishable by anomalous scaling of revival oscillations in the fermionic Green's function, but also in a unique Andreev-revival in the anomalous Green's function. The existence of this TFD/wormhole state surprisingly shows that the some quantum critical effects can survive the phase transition to superconductivity. This Andreev-revival is in principle an accessible signature of the transition to the TFD/wormhole phase detectable in the ac-Josephson current.

Title: Effect of droplet configurations within the functional renormalization group of the Ising model approaching the lower critical dimension
Authors: Ivan Balog, Lucija Nora Farkaš, Maroje Marohnić, Gilles Tarjus
Abstract: We explore the application of the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (NPFRG) within its most common approximation scheme based on truncations of the derivative expansion, to the $Z_2$-symmetric scalar $\varphi^4$ theory as the lower critical dimension $d_{\rm lc}$ is approached. We aim to assess whether the NPFRG - a broad, nonspecialized method which is accurate in $d\geq 2$ - can capture the effect of the localized (droplet) excitations that drive the disappearance of the phase transition in $d_{\rm lc}$ and control the critical behavior as $d\to d_{\rm lc}$. We extend a prior analysis to the next (second) order of the derivative expansion to check the convergence of the results and the robustness of the conclusions. The study turns out to be much more involved. Through extensive numerical and analytical work we provide evidence that the convergence to $d_{\rm lc}$ is nonuniform in the field dependence and is characterized by the emergence of a boundary layer near the minima of the fixed-point effective potential. This is the mathematical mechanism through which the NPFRG within the truncated derivative expansion reproduces nontrivial features predicted by the droplet theory of Bruce and Wallace [1,2], namely, the existence of two distinct small parameters as $d\to d_{\rm lc}$ that control different aspects of the critical behavior and that are nonperturbatively related. The second order of the derivative expansion fixes several issues that were encountered at the lower level and improves the compatibility with the droplet-theory predictions. [1] A. D. Bruce and D.

Title: Spatial QUBO: Convolutional Formulation of Large-Scale Binary Optimization with Dense Interactions
Authors: Hiroshi Yamashita, Hideyuki Suzuki
Abstract: The spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) is a promising optical hardware solver for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems with dense interactions. As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).

Title: Ideal Topological Flat Bands in Two-dimensional Moiré Heterostructures with Type-II Band Alignment
Authors: Yunzhe Liu, Anoj Aryal, Kaijie Yang, Dumitru Calugaru, Zhenyao Fang, Haoyu Hu, Qimin Yan, B. Andrei Bernevig, Chao-xing Liu
Abstract: Topological flat bands play an essential role in inducing exotic interacting physics, ranging from fractional Chern insulators to superconductivity, in moiré materials. In this work, we propose a design principle for realizing topological flat bands with "ideal quantum geometry", namely the trace of Fubini-Study metric equals to the Berry curvature, in a class of two-dimensional moiré heterostructures with type-II band alignment. We first introduce a moiré Chern-band model to describe this system and show that topological flat bands can be realized in this model when the moiré superlattice potential is stronger than the type-II atomic band gap of the heterostructure. Next, we map this model into a topological heavy fermion model that consists of a localized orbital for "f-electron" and a conducting band for "c-electron". We find that both the flatness and quantum geometry of the flat band in the topological heavy fermion model depend on the energy gap between c-electron and f-electron bands at $\Gamma$ which is experimentally controllable via external gate voltages. This tunability will allow us to realize an ideal topological flat band with zero band-width and ideal quantum geometry. Our design strategy of topological flat bands is insensitive of twist angle. We also discuss possible material candidates for moiré heterostructures with type-II band alignment.

Title: Trigonal warping enables linear optical spectroscopy in single-valley superconductors
Authors: Benjamin A. Levitan, Étienne Lantagne-Hurtubise
Abstract: In superconductors with multiple pairing channels, Bardasis-Schrieffer modes and clapping modes arise as fluctuations in channels whose angular momenta differ from that of the pair condensate. Crystal symmetries often impose selection rules which keep these modes optically dark. We show that if pairing occurs around a single Fermi surface, trigonal warping renders both of these modes, as well as the quasiparticle excitation gap, visible in the longitudinal and Hall optical responses. Our results suggest that rhombohedral graphene multilayers, which are believed to host the required ingredients, might offer an ideal setting for the study of exotic superconducting collective modes.

Title: Dissipation-Induced Steady States in Topological Superconductors: Mechanisms and Design Principles
Authors: M.S. Shustin, S.V. Aksenov, I.S. Burmistrov
Abstract: The search for conditions supporting degenerate steady states in nonequilibrium topological superconductors is important for advancing dissipative quantum engineering, a field that has attracted significant research attention over the past decade. In this study, we address this problem by investigating topological superconductors hosting unpaired Majorana modes under the influence of environmental dissipative fields. Within the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad framework and the third quantization formalism, we establish a correspondence between equilibrium Majorana zero modes and non-equilibrium kinetic zero modes. We further derive a simple algebraic relation between the numbers of these excitations expressed in terms of hybridization between the single-particle wavefunctions and linear dissipative fields. Based on these findings, we propose a practical recipes how to stabilize degenerate steady states in topological superconductors through controlled dissipation engineering. To demonstrate their applicability, we implement our general framework in the BDI-class Kitaev chain with long-range hopping and pairing terms -- a system known to host a robust edge-localized Majorana modes.

Title: Nanoconfined Grain Boundaries Increase Conductivity of Polycrystalline Molecular Crystals
Authors: Shujit Chandra Paul, William A. Goddard III, Michael J. Zdilla, Prabhat Prakash, Stephanie L. Wunder
Abstract: Soft-solid molecular crystals consist of crystalline grains and fluid grain boundaries (GB) that enhance grain binding and transport of Li+ ions between the grains. The total ionic conductivity consists of ion migration in both the grains and GBs. To unravel these contributions in adiponitrile (Adpn)-LiPF6 molecular crystals, the GB volume fraction was varied by changing the size of the crystals and the Adpn-LiPF6 molar ratio. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations indicate that ion motion was sub-diffusive in the grains and well-diffusive in the GBs, with GBs characterized as disordered nano-confined regions of higher charge carrier concentration (1M) than in saturated Adpn-LiPF6 solutions (0.04M), and Li+ ions predominantly solvated by cyano groups with few contact ion pairs. The diffusivity in the GBs is at least an order of magnitude higher than in the crystalline grains. The emergent picture is the grains as a reservoir of ions that migrate to the faster-conducting GBs.

Title: Likelihood-Based Heterogeneity Inference Reveals Non-Stationary Effects in Biohybrid Cell-Cargo Transport
Authors: Jan Albrecht, Lara S. Dautzenberg, Manfred Opper, Carsten Beta, Robert Großmann
Abstract: Variability of motility behavior in populations of microbiological agents is a ubiquitous phenomenon even in the case of genetically identical cells. Accordingly, passive objects introduced into such biological systems and driven by them will also exhibit heterogeneous motion patterns. Here, we study a biohybrid system of passive beads driven by active ameboid cells and use a likelihood approach to estimate the heterogeneity of the bead dynamics from their discretely sampled trajectories. We showcase how this approach can deal with information-scarce situations and provides natural uncertainty bounds for heterogeneity estimates. Using these advantages we particularly uncover that the heterogeneity in the system is time-dependent.

Title: Magnetism and nonlinear charge transport in NiFe2O4/γ-Al2O3/SrTiO3 heterostructure: Toward Spintronic Applications
Authors: Amit Chanda, Thor Hvid-Olsen, Christina Hoegfeldt, Anshu Gupta, Alessandro Palliotto, Fardin Ghaffari-Tabrizi, Maja A. Dunstan, Kasper S. Pedersen, Dae-Sung Park, Damon J. Carrad, Thomas Sand Jespersen, Felix Trier
Abstract: We present the synthesis and study of the magnetic and electronic properties of NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 heterostructure. The {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 interface hosts a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with large spin-orbit coupling, making it promising for spintronics applications if it can be coupled to a suitable source of spin currents. Here, we synthesize a ferrimagnetic insulating NiFe2O4(001) layer on {\gamma}-Al2O3(001)/SrTiO3(001) using a low-temperature reactive sputtering at 150 deg C without compromising the mobility and charge carrier density of the 2DEG at the {\gamma}-Al2O3(001)/SrTiO3(001) interface. The sheet resistance of both {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 and NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 exhibits metallic behavior down to cryogenic temperatures, with a low temperature upturn driven by the Kondo-like scattering. Most importantly, NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 behaves as a magnetic diode at low temperatures, and its rectification performance increases significantly with increasing magnetic field strength giving rise to a robust magneto-electronic rectification effect at low temperatures, which provides a first step towards the development of all-oxide heterostructures capable of efficient spin-charge conversion.

Title: Integrability from a single conservation law in quantum spin chains
Authors: Akihiro Hokkyo
Abstract: We prove that for translationally invariant quantum spin chains with finite-range interactions, the existence of a specific conservation law known as the Reshetikhin condition implies the presence of infinitely many local conserved quantities, i.e., integrability. This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.

Title: Stochastic ion emission perturbation mechanisms in atom probe tomography: Linking simulations to experiment
Authors: Aslam Shaikh, Tero Mäkinen, François Vurpillot, Mikko Alava, Ivan Lomakin
Abstract: Field evaporation in atom probe tomography (APT) includes known processes related to surface migration of atoms, such as the so-called roll-up mechanism. They lead to trajectory aberrations and artefacts on the detector. These processes are usually neglected in simulations. The inclusion of such processes is crucial for providing reliable models for the development and verification of APT reconstruction algorithms, a key part of the whole methodology. Here we include stochastic lateral velocity perturbations and a roll-up mechanism to simulations performed using the Robin--Rolland model. By comparing with experimental data from Al and Ni systems, we find the stochastic perturbation energy distributions that allow us to very accurately reproduce the detector patterns seen experimentally and thus greatly improve the accuracy of the simulations. We also explore the possible causes of remaining discrepancies between the experimental and simulated detector patterns.

Title: Dipolar excitonic quantum wires at atomically sharp lateral interfaces
Authors: Elie Vandoolaeghe, Francesco Fortuna, Suman Kumar Chakraborty, Biswajeet Nayak, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Prasana K. Sahoo, Thibault Chervy, Puneet A. Murthy
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) quantum systems are a cornerstone of many-body physics. However, their realization in solids has traditionally relied on top-down methods, which are limited by structural disorder and coarse confinement. Here, we demonstrate a fundamentally distinct route: the emergence of 1D quantum matter at the atomically sharp interface between monolayer semiconductors. Using lateral $MoSe_2-WSe_2$ heterostructures, we identify interfacial excitonic quasiparticles that are bound to the crystal junction. Photoluminescence spectroscopy resolves these excitons into a ladder of discrete states, establishing nanoscopic 1D confinement at length scales of 3 nm. These excitons possess exceptional large permanent in-plane electric dipole moments exceeding e x 2 nm, and exhibit micron-scale, highly anisotropic diffusion confined to the interface. Crucially, the lateral geometry enables dynamic, in-situ reconfiguration of the exciton's internal structure. By introducing electrostatic doping, we demonstrate a collapse of the dipole moment and a 20-fold reduction in radiative lifetime. This structural tunability establishes lateral interfaces as a uniquely powerful platform for the 'bottom-up' engineering of 1D quantum matter. By enabling the dynamic tuning of wavefunctions within a single atomic monolayer, this work opens a scalable route toward 1D excitonic circuits and strongly correlated 1D bosonic phases.

Title: Windmilling clusters of active quadrupoles
Authors: Margaret Rosenberg, Hartmut Löwen
Abstract: Active matter has thrived in recent years, driven both by the insight that it underlies fundamental processes in nature, and by its vast potential for applications. This allows for innovation both inspired by experimental observations, and by construction of novel systems with desired properties. In this paper, we develop a novel system in the search for a new kind of pattern formation: microstructural motifs with orthogonal alignment. Taking a simple active Brownian particle (ABP) model applied to dumbbell-shaped particles, we add a quadrupolar interaction by positioning two antiparallel magnetic dipolar moments on each particle. We find that the phase behavior is determined by the competition between active motion and the orthogonal alignment favored by quadrupolar attraction. By varying these quantities, we are able to tune both the internal structure of the aggregates, and find a surprising stability of triangular aggregates, to the point of clusters of size $N=3$ being strongly overrepresented. Although none of the component particles are chiral, the resulting structures spin in a random, fixed direction due to combination of the polarity of the active motion. This results in an ensemble of windmilling (randomly spinning in a circular motion) aggregates with windmill-like shape (due to the three- or four core component dumbbells). Ultimately, this simple model shows an interesting range of microstructural motifs, with great potential for experimental implementations.

Title: Transition between 2D Symmetry Protected Topological Phases on a Klein Bottle
Authors: Vibhu Ravindran, Bowen Yang, Xie Chen
Abstract: Manifolds with nontrivial topology play an essential role in the study of topological phases of matter. In this paper, we study the nontrivial symmetry response of the $2+1$D $Z_2$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase when the system is put on a non-orientable manifold -- the Klein bottle. In particular, we find that when a symmetry defect is inserted along the orientation-reversing cycle of the Klein bottle, the ground state of the system gets an extra charge. This response remains well defined at transition points into the trivial SPT phase, resulting in an exact two-fold degeneracy in the ground state independent of the system size. We demonstrate the symmetry response using exactly solvable lattice models of the SPT phase, as well as numerical work across the transition. We explore the connection of this result to the modular transformation of the $3+1$D $Z_2$ gauge theory and the emergent nature of the parity symmetry in the $Z_2$ SPT phase.

Title: Multiscale analysis of large twist ferroelectricity and swirling dislocations in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Md Tusher Ahmed, Chenhaoyue Wang, Amartya S. Banerjee, Nikhil Chandra Admal
Abstract: With its atomically thin structure and intrinsic ferroelectric properties, heterodeformed bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has gained prominence in next-generation non-volatile memory applications. However, studies to date have focused almost exclusively on small$-$twist bilayer hBN, leaving the question of whether ferroelectricity can persist under small heterostrain and large heterodeformation entirely unexplored. In this work, we establish the crystallographic origin of ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN configurations heterodeformed relative to high-symmetry configurations such as the AA-stacking and the $21.786789^\circ$ twisted configuration ($\Sigma 7$), using Smith normal form bicrystallography. We then demonstrate out-of-plane ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN across configurations vicinal to both the AA and $\Sigma7$ stackings. Atomistic simulations reveal that AA-vicinal systems support ferroelectricity under both small twist and small strain, with polarization switching in the latter governed by the deformation of swirling dislocations rather than the straight interface dislocations seen in the former. For $\Sigma7$-vicinal systems, where existing interatomic potentials underperform particularly under extreme out-of-plane compression, we develop a density-functional-theory-informed continuum framework-the bicrystallography-informed frame-invariant multiscale (BFIM) model, which captures out-of-plane ferroelectricity in heterodeformed configurations vicinal to the $\Sigma 7$ stacking. Interface dislocations in these large heterodeformed bilayer configurations exhibit markedly smaller Burgers vectors compared to the interface dislocations in small-twist and small-strain bilayer hBN. The BFIM model reproduces experimental results and provides a powerful, computationally efficient framework for predicting ferroelectricity in large-unit-cell heterostructures.

Title: Emergent Hierarchy in Localized States of Organic Quantum Chains
Authors: L. L. Lage, A. B. Félix, D. S. Gomes, M. L. Pereira Jr., A. Latgé
Abstract: Organic Quantum Chains (OQCs) represent a newly synthesized class of carbon-based nanostructures whose quasi-one-dimensional nature gives rise to unconventional electronic and transport phenomena. Here we investigate the electronic and transport properties of recently synthesized OQCs [Nature Communications, 12, 5895 (2021)]. Structural stability was first assessed through molecular dynamics relaxation combined with density functional theory (DFT). The optimized coordinates are then used in a tight-binding model with exponentially decaying hopping parameterization, which reproduces the DFT results with high accuracy. Our calculations reveal a robust and nearly constant energy gap across several OQC configurations, in agreement with experimental data. We also identify emergent hierarchical states, characterized by distinct localization behaviors within sets of localized bands. Finally, we analyze different transport responses in scenarios involving the one-dimensional OQC coupled to carbon corrals, as observed in the experimental data, highlighting their potential as promising systems for application in carbon nanodevices.

Title: Are diffusion models ready for materials discovery in unexplored chemical space?
Authors: Sanghyun Kim, Gihyeon Jeon, Seungwoo Hwang, Jiho Lee, Jisu Jung, Seungwu Han, Sungwoo Kang
Abstract: While diffusion models are attracting increasing attention for the design of novel materials, their ability to generate low-energy structures in unexplored chemical spaces has not been systematically assessed. Here, we evaluate the performance of two diffusion models, MatterGen and DiffCSP, against three databases: a ternary oxide set (constructed by a genetic algorithm), a ternary nitride set (constructed by template informatics), and the GNoME database (constructed by a combination of both). We find that diffusion models generally perform stably in well-sampled chemical spaces (oxides and nitrides), but are less effective in uncommon ones (GNoME), which contains many compositions involving rare-earth elements and unconventional stoichiometry. Finally, we assess their size-extrapolation capability and observe a significant drop in performance when the number of atoms exceeds the trained range. This is attributed to the limitations imposed by periodic boundary conditions, which we refer to as the curse of periodicity. This study paves the way for future developments in materials design by highlighting both the strength and the limitations of diffusion models.

Title: Automated laboratory x-ray diffractometer and fluorescence spectrometer for high-throughput materials characterization
Authors: Hyun Sang Park, Timothy Long, Michael Wall, Alexander deJong, Ali Rachidi, Kacper Kowalik, Rohit Berlia, David Elbert, Timothy P. Weihs, Robert Drake, Todd C. Hufnagel
Abstract: The increasing importance of artificial intelligence and machine learning in materials research has created demand for automated, high-throughput characterization techniques capable of rapidly generating large data sets. We describe here a new instrument for simultaneous X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, optimized for high-throughput studies of combinatorial specimens. A bright, focused, high-energy X-ray beam (24 keV) combined with a pixel array area detector allows spatially-resolved (~200 {\mu}m) transmission diffraction measurements through thick (100 {\mu}m) specimens of structural metals with exposure times as short as 1 s. Simultaneously, a silicon drift detector records X-ray fluorescence from the specimen for spatially-resolved measurement of composition. Specimen handling is fully automated, with a robot inside the X-ray enclosure manipulating the sample for measurements at different locations. Data orchestration is also automated, with data streamed off the instrument and processed autonomously. In this paper we assess the performance of the instrument in terms of throughput, resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio, and provide an example of its capabilities through a combinatorial study of Cu-Ti alloys to demonstrate rapid data set creation.

Title: Boltzmann-Kolmogorov equation
Authors: Mário J. de Oliveira
Abstract: We investigate the properties of a Kolmogorov equation governing the time evolution of the probability distribution defined in phase space. Energy is strictly conserved along a trajectory in phase space, meaning the equation is appropriate to describe an isolated system, and the stationary state is the Gibbs microcanonical distribution. The equation predicts the increase in entropy in agreement with thermodynamics, and in contrast with the Liouville equation, which conserves entropy. Using an approximation in which the distribution is a product of one-particle distributions, we derive the Boltzmann equation of kinetic theory. We also consider a Kolmogorov equation to describe an open system in contact with the external environment. In this case the equation describes not only the situation in which the system is found in thermodynamic equilibrium with a Gibbs canonical distribution in the stationary state, but also the nonequilibrium steady state with a continuous production of entropy.

Title: On The Finetuning of MLIPs Through the Lens of Iterated Maps With BPTT
Authors: Evan Dramko, Yizhi Zhu, Aleksandar Krivokapic, Geoffroy Hautier, Thomas Reps, Christopher Jermaine, Anastasios Kyrillidis
Abstract: Accurate structural relaxation is critical for advanced materials design. Traditional approaches built on physics-derived first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, motivating the creation of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which strive to faithfully reproduce first-principles computed forces. We propose a fine-tuning method to be used on a pretrained MLIP in which we create a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes the predicted final structures directly. Trajectories are unrolled and gradients are tracked through the entire relaxation. We show that this method consistently improves performance across all evaluated pretrained models; resulting in an average of roughly 32% reduction in prediction error. Interestingly, we show the process is robust to substantial variation in the relaxation setup, achieving negligibly different results across varied hyperparameter and procedural modifications.

Title: $α$-RuCl$_3$ intercalated into graphite: a new three-dimensional platform for exotic quantum phases
Authors: Aleksandar Razpopov, Shirin Mozaffari, Takahiro Matsuoka, Matthew Cothrine, Nan Huang, Roser Valentí, David Mandrus
Abstract: Multilayer graphene with different stacking sequences has emerged as a powerful setting for correlated and topological phases. In parallel, progress in graphene heterostructures with magnetic or correlated materials-most notably the Kitaev candidate $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$-has demonstrated charge transfer, magnetic proximity effects, and interfacial reconstruction, creating new opportunities for engineered quantum systems. Motivated by these developments, we explore a three-dimensional analogue in which $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ layers are inserted directly into the van der Waals gaps of graphite, forming an intercalated system. Here, we report the successful synthesis and comprehensive characterization of graphite intercalated with $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction, quantum oscillation measurements, and first-principles electronic structure calculations, we study the structural and electronic properties of these intercalated crystals. Our results demonstrate that graphite intercalated with $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ offers a robust route to develop three-dimensional materials with access to novel correlated and topological states.

Title: Chiral orbital current driven topological Hall effect in Mn3Si2Te6
Authors: Arnab Das, Soumik Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: Chiral orbital current (COC) plays a crucial role in governing the magnetization and transport behaviour in the layered ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn3Si2Te6. Here, we observe that the topological Hall effect (THE), typically attributed to Berry curvature from chiral spin textures, originates from COC, which produces an emergent magnetic field for conduction electrons due to its real-space orbital textures. We find that the THE signal strengthens as we move down from bulk to nanoflakes, but tends to disappear with increasing current, along with the disappearance of the COC state. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and the observed THE, suggesting that large Berry curvature and topological transport can arise purely from orbital degrees of freedom, providing a new platform for engineering dissipationless transport in 2D magnets.

Title: Multimode Jahn-Teller Effect in Negatively Charged Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in Diamond
Authors: Jianhua Zhang, Jun Liu, Z. Z. Zhu, K. M. Ho, V. V. Dobrovitski, C. Z. Wang
Abstract: We present a first-principles study of the multimode Jahn-Teller (JT) effect in the exctied $^{3}E$ state of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Using density functional theory combined with an intrinsic distortion path (IDP) analysis, we resolve the full activation pathways of the JT distortion and quantitatively decompose the distortion into contributions from individual vibrational modes. We find that multiple vibrational modes participate cooperatively in the JT dynamics, giving rise to a shallow adiabatic potential energy surface with low barriers, consistent with thermally activated pseudorotation. The dominant JT-active modes are found to closely correspond to vibrational features observed in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), in agreement with recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results establish a microscopic, mode-resolved picture of vibronic coupling in the excited-state NV center and provide new insight into dephasing, relaxation, and optically driven dynamics relevant to solid-state quantum technologies.

Title: Entropic trade-off relations in stochastic thermodynamics via replica Markov processes
Authors: Yoshihiko Hasegawa
Abstract: Traditional thermodynamic trade-off relations usually apply to quantities that depend linearly on probability distributions. In contrast, many important information-theoretic measures, such as entropies, are nonlinear and thus difficult to analyze with existing frameworks. Motivated by replica ideas in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we introduce \emph{replica Markov processes}, i.e., Markovian dynamics of $K$ independent, identical copies, and derive trade-off relations that bound relative moments of replica observables in terms of dynamical activity. By choosing appropriate replica observables, these inequalities translate into bounds on nonlinear quantities of the original single process. Focusing on entropic measures of uncertainty, we obtain upper bounds on the time derivative and the value of the Tsallis entropy for general trajectory-observable distributions, and corresponding bounds for diffusion on networks. We also illustrate how replicas can handle other nonlinear functionals such as extreme-value observables. Finally, we extend the construction to continuously monitored open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics, where the bounds are expressed in terms of the quantum dynamical activity. These results provide entropic counterparts to activity-based uncertainty relations and establish a general method for constraining nonlinear information-theoretic quantities in stochastic and quantum thermodynamics.

Title: Beyond on-site Hubbard interaction in charge dynamics of cuprate superconductors
Authors: Hiroyuki Yamase
Abstract: In this review, we first present compelling evidence from resonant inelastic x-ray scattering data that highlights the significance of the long-range Coulomb interaction in cuprate charge dynamics, particularly around the in-plane momentum q=(0,0). We show that these experimental observations are well-captured by the layered t-J-V model, which extends the standard t-J framework to include the long-range Coulomb interaction V and the layered structure. This new perspective elucidates how charge dynamics renormalizes one-particle excitation properties, leading to several profound and often counterintuitive consequences. We demonstrate that the electron dispersion does not exhibit a sharp kink, and Landau quasiparticles persist in the low-energy limit despite a significant suppression of their spectral weight. We further show that while charge fluctuations alone cannot fully account for the pseudogap, they are a crucial component for understanding its formation. Additionally, we reveal that optical plasmon excitations generate fermionic quasiparticles, known as plasmarons, which give rise to a distinct, incoherent replica band. We argue that accurately describing these plasmonic effects requires a three-dimensional theoretical approach. This perspective on plasmon excitations may offer a critically new clue to a long-standing puzzle: why multi-layer cuprate superconductors, containing more than two CuO2 layers per unit cell, consistently exhibit a higher critical temperature Tc than their single-layer counterparts. Finally, we review the spin-fluctuation mechanism of superconductivity suffers from the "self-restraint effect" and show how important the screened Coulomb interaction is in the spin-fluctuation mechanism to realize high-Tc superconductivity.

Title: Emergent ac Effect in Nonreciprocal Coupled Condensates
Authors: Ji Zou, Valerii K. Kozin, Daniel Loss, Jelena Klinovaja
Abstract: We report an emergent ac Josephson-like effect arising without external bias, driven by the interplay between nonreciprocity and nonlinearity in coupled condensates. Using a minimal model of three mutually nonreciprocally coupled condensates, we uncover a rich landscape of dynamical phases governed by generalized Josephson equations. This goes beyond the Kuramoto framework owing to inherent nonreciprocity and dynamically evolving effective couplings, leading to static and dynamical ferromagnetic and (anti)vortex states with nontrivial phase winding. Most strikingly, we identify an ac phase characterized by the emergence of two distinct frequencies, which spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry: one associated with the precession of the global U(1) Goldstone mode and the other with a stabilized limit cycle in a five-dimensional phase space. This phase features bias-free autonomous oscillatory currents beyond conventional Josephson dynamics. We further examine how instabilities develop in the ferromagnetic and vortex states, and how they drive transitions into the ac regime. Interestingly, the transition is hysteretic: phases with different winding numbers destabilize under distinct conditions, reflecting their inherently different nonlinear structures. Our work lays the foundation for exploring nonreciprocity-driven novel dynamical phases in a broad class of condensate platforms.

Title: High bosonic Bott index and transport of multi-band topological magnons
Authors: Kai Tao Huang, X.S Wang
Abstract: Magnons are bosonic quasiparticles in magnetically ordered systems. Bosonic Bott index has been affirmed as a real-space topological invariant for a two-band ferromagnetic model. In this work,we theoretically investigate the topology and transport of magnons in a multi-band bosonic Kagome ferromagnetic model. We demonstrate the validity of the bosonic Bott indices of values larger than 1 in multi-band magnonic systems by showing the agreement with Chern numbers in the clean limit and the bulk-boundary correspondence during the topological phase transition. For the high Bott index phase, the disorder-induced topological phase transition occurs in a multi-step manner. Using a generalized Landauer-Buttiker formalism, we reveal how the magnon transport depends on Gilbert damping and disorder under coherent excitation or temperature difference. The results further justify the bosonic Bott index as a robust real-space topological invariant for multi-band magnonic systems and provide insights into the transport of topological magnons.

Title: Matter with apparent and hidden spin physics
Authors: Jia-Xin Xiong, Xiuwen Zhang, Lin-Ding Yuan, Alex Zunger
Abstract: Materials with interesting physical properties are often designed based on our understanding of the target physical effects. The physical properties can be either explicitly observed ("apparent") or concealed by the perceived symmetry ("hidden") but still exist. Both are enabled by specific symmetries and induced by certain physical interactions. Using the underlying approach of condensed matter theory of real materials (rather than schematic model Hamiltonians), we discuss apparent and hidden physics in real materials focusing on the properties of spin splitting and spin polarization. Depending on the enabling symmetries and underlying physical interactions, we classify spin effects into four categories with each having two subtypes; representative materials are pointed out. We then discuss the electric tunability and switch of apparent and hidden spin splitting and polarization in antiferromagnets. Finally, we extend "hidden effects" to views that are farsighted in the sense of resolving the correct atomistic and reciprocal symmetry and replaced by the incorrect higher symmetry. This framework could guide and enable systematic discovery of such intriguing effects.

Title: Non-invertible symmetries and mixed anomalies from conserved current construction in (3+1)D twisted $BF$ topological quantum field theories
Authors: Zhi-Feng Zhang, Yizhou Huang, Qing-Rui Wang, Peng Ye
Abstract: We develop a current-based construction of generalized symmetries in $(3+1)$D twisted $BF$ topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), focusing on intrinsically non-invertible higher-form symmetries and their mixed anomalies. Starting from the equations of motion, we extract conserved currents and exponentiate the corresponding charges to obtain topological symmetry operators. This gives a step-by-step procedure for constructing symmetry operators, fusion, and anomaly diagnostics directly from the continuum action. We focus on twisted $BF$ theories with gauge group $G=\prod_i \mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ and an $a\wedge a\wedge b$ twist, where $a$'s and $b$ are 1-form and 2-form gauge fields, respectively. These theories realize non-Abelian $(3+1)$D TQFTs supporting Borromean-rings braiding and describe three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders in condensed matter. For $G=(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$, a microscopic realization is given by the $\mathbb{D}_4$ Kitaev quantum double model. Two distinct classes of conserved currents emerge: Type-I currents generate invertible higher-form symmetries with group-like fusion, while Type-II currents require additional consistency conditions on gauge-field configurations, leading to intrinsically non-invertible symmetries dressed by projectors. We compute the fusion algebra: invertible operators admit inverses, while non-invertible ones exhibit multi-channel fusion governed by projector fusion. We diagnose mixed anomalies by coupling multiple conserved currents to background gauge fields, revealing two outcomes: anomalies canceled by anomaly inflow from a higher-dimensional theory, and intrinsic gauging obstructions encoded in the $(3+1)$D continuum theory. Overall, our results provide a unified and practical approach for constructing and characterizing higher-form symmetries, which can be extended to more general TQFTs and topological orders.

Title: Emulating 2D Materials with Magnons
Authors: Bobby Kaman, Jinho Lim, Yingkai Liu, Axel Hoffmann
Abstract: Spin waves (magnons) in 2D materials have received increasing interest due to their unique states and potential for tunability. However, many interesting features of these systems, including Dirac points and topological states, occur at high frequencies, where experimental probes are limited. Here, we study a crystal formed by patterning a hexagonal array of holes in a perpendicularly magnetized thin film. Through simulation, we find that the magnonic band structure imitates that of graphene, but additionally has some kagome-like character and includes a few flat bands. Surprisingly, its nature can be understood using a 9-band tight-binding Hamiltonian. This clear analogy to 2D materials enables band-gap engineering in 2D, topological magnons along 1D phase boundaries, and spectrally isolated modes at 0D point defects. Interestingly, the 1D phase boundaries allow access to the valley degree of freedom through a magnonic analog of the quantum valley-Hall insulator. These approaches can be extended to other magnonic systems, but are potentially more general due to the simplicity of the model, which resembles existing results from electron, phonon, photon, and cold atom systems. This finding brings the physics of spin waves in 2D materials to more experimentally accessible scales, augments it, and outlines a few principles for controlling magnonic states.

Title: Topological $Z_4$ spin-orbital liquid on the honeycomb lattice
Authors: Masahiko G. Yamada
Abstract: We perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations of the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice and resolve the long-standing question of its ground state in an unbiased and quantitatively controlled manner. We find compelling numerical evidence that the ground state is a gapped $Z_4$ spin-orbital liquid, characterized by a finite topological entanglement entropy close to $\ln(4)$, the absence of both $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ and lattice symmetry breaking, and a variationally optimized ground-state energy well below competing Dirac spin liquid states. By exploiting full $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ symmetry and keeping up to 12,800 $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ multiplets, corresponding to more than one million $\mathrm{U}(1)$ states, we achieve unprecedented accuracy for two-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ quantum magnets. Finite-size scaling of energies and entanglement entropies supports a robust gapped phase in the two-dimensional limit, while a gapless critical state on narrow cylinders is identified as a proximate remnant of a Dirac spin-orbital liquid. Our results establish the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ honeycomb Heisenberg model as a concrete realization of a gapped $Z_4$ spin-orbital liquid and provide robust numerical evidence for topological order in a highly symmetric two-dimensional quantum magnet.

Title: Two-Level System Microwave Losses in Chemically Pure Bulk Niobium Oxide Samples
Authors: Vishal Ganesan, Jiankun Zhang, Drew G. Wild, Alexey Bezryadin
Abstract: Losses from two-level systems (TLS) associated with amorphous oxides remain one of the primary limitations to the performance of superconducting qubits and microwave cavities. Niobium resonators are widely used in quantum science experiments, yet niobium's natural oxide layer contains various types of oxides whose relative contributions to TLS loss have not been clearly distinguished. Here, we use a superconducting 3D microwave cavity to measure chemically pure oxides \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Using this approach, we directly compare the loss characteristics of \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Our measurements show that the \ch{Nb2O5} oxide exhibits losses which have the power and temperature behavior expected for TLS. Moreover, the measurements agree with existing theoretical models. Analogous measurements performed on \ch{NbO2} do not show any detectable TLS loss signatures. These results provide direct experimental evidence that \ch{Nb2O5} is the dominant TLS host in niobium resonators and establish a general framework for separating oxide-specific dissipation channels.

Title: Data-driven active learning approaches for accelerating materials discovery
Authors: Jiaxin Chen, Tianjiao Wan, Hui Geng, Liang Xiong, Guohong Wang, Yihan Zhao, Longxiang Deng, Zijian Gao, Susu Fang, Zheng Luo, Huaimin Wang, Shanshan Wang, Kele Xu
Abstract: Materials discovery is a cornerstone of modern technological advancement, yet it remains constrained by traditional trial-and-error paradigms and the inherent bias of human intuition. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in materials science by effectively modeling structure-property relationships. Despite substantial efforts to enhance model expressiveness, data efficiency remains an equally critical challenge, given the limited availability of experimental and computational resources. Active learning (AL), as a data-driven machine learning paradigm, has shown great promise for discovering novel materials and enabling the efficient navigation of vast materials spaces. In this review, we follow the evolution of sampling strategy design techniques in AL, from Bayesian optimization to advanced deep learning-based strategies. We then highlight how AL enhances data efficiency across various data regimes, ranging from task-specific settings with limited data to the development of general-purpose datasets and large-scale models. We further provide a systematic overview of AL applications throughout the materials research pipeline, including computational simulation, composition and structural design, process optimization, and self-driving laboratory systems. Finally, we pinpoint key challenges and future perspectives of AL in materials discovery.

Title: Quantum Theory and Unusual Dielectric Functions of Graphene
Authors: V. M. Mostepanenko, G. L. Klimchitskaya
Abstract: We address the spatially nonlocal dielectric functions of graphene at any frequency derived starting fromthe first principles of thermal quantum field theory using the formalism of the polarization tensor. After a brief review of this formalism, the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions are considered at any relationship between the frequency and the wave vector. The analytic properties of their real and imaginary parts are investigated at low and high frequencies. Emphasis is given to the double pole at zero frequency which arises in the transverse dielectric function. The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed. We guess that a more complete dielectric response of ordinary metals should also be spatially nonlocal and its transverse part may possess the double pole in the region of evanescent waves.

Title: Anisotropic collective excitations of Bose gases in modified Newtonian dynamics
Authors: Ning Liu
Abstract: Collective excitations are fundamental in quantum many-body physics, yet their spectra have traditionally been studied within Newtonian dynamics. In this paper, we investigate collective excitations in Bose gases under Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We derive an anisotropic excitation spectrum in the MOND regime. This anisotropy arises directly from the intrinsic nonlinear structure of the MOND Poisson equation, forming a distinctive signature of the modified gravitational response. We then analyze the Jeans instability, obtaining analytic expressions for the direction-dependent critical wavelength and mass. These results advance our understanding of collective behavior in quantum systems under modified dynamics and establish clear theoretical signatures for testing MOND-like effects in quantum simulators.

Title: Surface Phonon Hall Viscosity Induced Phonon Chirality and Nonreciprocity in Magnetic Topological Insulator Films
Authors: Abhinava Chatterjee, Chao-Xing Liu
Abstract: The surface half-quantum Hall effect, a hallmark consequence of axion electrodynamics, can be induced by gapping out the surface states of topological insulators through surface magnetization, and has led to a variety of topological response phenomena observed in experiments. In this work, we investigate phonon dynamics originating from an acoustic analog - the surface phonon Hall viscosity - that can also occur at the surface of magnetic topological insulators. This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons.

Title: Deconfined quantum criticality with internal supersymmetry
Authors: Zhi-Qiang Gao, Hui Yang, Yan-Qi Wang
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) describes direct, non-fine-tuned quantum phase transition between two ordered phases that break distinct and seemingly unrelated symmetries, providing a route to continuous phase transition beyond the conventional Ginzburg--Landau paradigm. In this work we extend the DQCP paradigm to systems with internal supersymmetry (SUSY), where the on-site Hilbert space furnishes a representation of a Lie superalgebra, and the Hamiltonian is invariant under the corresponding Lie supergroup. Focusing on the minimal supersymmetric generalization of spin $SU(2)$, namely $OSp(1|2)$, we propose a supersymmetric deconfined quantum critical point (sDQCP) between a phase that breaks internal $OSp(1|2)$ and a phase that instead breaks lattice rotation symmetry. We formulate a non-linear sigma model on the supersphere target space that captures the symmetry intertwinement characteristic of the sDQCP, and we further develop a gauge theory description to address its dynamical properties, including a heuristic argument for 3D XY critical behavior. Finally, we show that explicitly breaking $OSp(1|2)$ down to $SU(2)$ continuously connects our sDQCP to the conventional DQCP scenario.

Title: Quantum-geometry-enabled Landau-Zener tunneling in singular flat bands
Authors: Xuanyu Long, Feng Liu
Abstract: Flat-band materials have attracted substantial interest for their intriguing quantum geometric effects. Here we investigate how singular flat bands (SFBs) respond to a static, uniform electric field and whether they can support single-particle dc transport. By constructing a minimal two-band lattice model, we show that away from the singular band crossing point (BCP), the Wannier-Stark (WS) spectrum of the flat band is well captured by an intraband Berry phase $\Phi_{\mathrm{B}}$. The associated WS eigenstates are exponentially localized along the field direction, precluding dc transport. In contrast, near the BCP the interband Berry connection becomes prominent and drives Landau-Zener tunneling, which bends the flat-band WS ladder and delocalizes the SFB wavefunctions. Remarkably, this regime is governed solely by the maximal quantum distance $d$ through two geometric phases $(\theta,\varphi)$: $\theta$ characterizes the tunneling rate and $\varphi$ acts as a generalized Berry phase. These results highlight the essential role of quantum geometry in enabling nontrivial transport signatures in SFBs.

Title: Metal Halide Perovskites for Violet and Ultraviolet Light Emission
Authors: Sebastian Fernández, Manchen Hu, Tyler K. Colenbrander, Divine Mbachu, Daniel N. Congreve
Abstract: Emissive metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as excellent candidates for next-generation optoelectronics due to their sharp color purity, inexpensive processing, and bandgap tunability. However, the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs has lagged behind due to challenges related to material and device stability, charge carrier transport, tunability into the ultraviolet spectrum, toxicity, and scalability. Here, we review the progress of both violet and ultraviolet MHP nanomaterials and light-emitting diodes, including materials synthesis and device fabrication across various crystal structures and dimensions (e.g., bulk thin films, 2D thin films, nanoplatelets, colloidal nanocrystals, and more) as well as lead-free platforms (e.g., rare-earth metal halide perovskites). By highlighting several pathways to continue the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs while also proposing tactics to overcome their outstanding challenges, we demonstrate the potential of state-of-the-art violet and ultraviolet MHP materials and devices for important applications in public health, 3D printing, nanofabrication, and more.

Title: Anisotropic Kitaev Spin Glass in Li$_{2}$Ru$_{x}$Ir$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$
Authors: Mayia A. Vranas, Alejandro Ruiz, Vikram Nagarajan, Erik Lamb, Gerald D. Morris, Zahir Islam, Christie Nelson, Benjamin A. Frandsen, James G. Analytis, Alex Frano
Abstract: Kitaev iridates have been proposed as candidates for realizing an elusive quantum spin liquid (QSL) state, in which strong spin-orbit coupling and bond-directional exchange generate a highly frustrated and entangled ground state. However, all physical systems proposed to host this ground state, including Li$_2$IrO$_3$, Na$_2$IrO$_3$, and RuCl$_3$, develop magnetic order at low temperatures due to competing interactions. Nonetheless, theoretical modeling of experimental data has shown that Kitaev interactions are still present, motivating the application of perturbations such as pressure, magnetic field, and chemical doping to drive the system into the QSL phase. Here we study $\beta$-Li$_{2}$Ru$_{x}$Ir$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$ with dilute levels of Ru, $x \lesssim 10\%$. Through a combination of magnetometry, resonant elastic X-ray scattering, ac-heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation/resonance, we show that weak magnetic disorder suppresses long-range antiferromagnetic order and stabilizes an anisotropic spin glass that retains key signatures of Kitaev exchange. This Kitaev spin glass shows pronounced directional anisotropy in its magnetic susceptibility and thermoremenant magnetization. These results demonstrate that dilute magnetic disorder can access an anisotropic Kitaev spin glass: a proximate phase that freezes the Kitaev frustration landscape. This could provide a new window into the degeneracy, anisotropy, and competing interactions underlying the Kitaev QSL.

Title: Shearing Off the Tree: Emerging Branch Structure and Born's Rule in an Equilibrated Multiverse
Authors: Philipp Strasberg, Joseph Schindler
Abstract: Within the many worlds interpretation (MWI) it is believed that, as time passes on, the linearity of the Schrödinger equation together with decoherence generate an exponentially growing tree of branches where "everything happens", provided the branches are defined for a decohering basis. By studying an example, using exact numerical diagonalization of the Schrödinger equation to compute the decoherent histories functional, we find that this picture needs revision. Our example shows decoherence for histories defined at a few times, but a significant fraction (often the vast majority) of branches shows strong interference effects for histories of many times. In a sense made precise below, the histories independently sample an equilibrated quantum process, and, remarkably, we find that only histories that sample frequencies in accordance with Born's rule remain decoherent. Our results suggest that there is more structure in the many worlds tree than previously anticipated, influencing arguments of both proponents and opponents of the MWI.

Title: Enhanced sensing of a weak Stark field under the influence of Aubry-André-Harper criticality
Authors: Ayan Sahoo, Debraj Rakshit
Abstract: The localization transition can be exploited as a resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in parameter estimation. We demonstrate that by employing different classes of localization inducing potentials, one can significantly enhance the precision of parameter estimation. Specifically, we focus on the precision measurement of the Stark strength parameter encoded in the low- and high-energy eigenstates of a one-dimensional fermionic lattice under the influence of Aubry-André-Harper localization-delocalization transition. For the ground state, we consider the single-particle system, in addition to the system at half filling. Our work reveals that Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) offers superior scaling with respect to the system size compared to the pure Stark case, leading to a better parameter estimation. However, experimental measurement of the QFI based on fidelity in a multibody system is a significant challenge. To address this, we suggest experimentally relevant operators that can be utilized to achieve precision surpassing the Heisenberg Limit (HL) or can even saturate the QFI scaling. These operators, relevant for practical experimental setups, provide a feasible pathway to harness the advantages offered by the localization-delocalization transition by exploiting two distinct localizing potentials for quantum-enhanced parameter estimation.

Title: Topologically protected Bell-cat states in a simple spin model
Authors: B. Lajci, D. H. J. O'Dell, J. Mumford
Abstract: We consider the topological properties of the so-called central spin model that consists of $N$ identical spins coupled to a single distinguishable central spin which arises in physical systems such as circuit-QED and bosonic Josephson junctions coupled to an impurity atom. The model closely corresponds to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model except that the chain of sites in the SSH model is replaced by a chain of states in Fock space specifying the magnetization. We find that the model accommodates topologically protected eigenstates that are `Bell-cat' states consisting of a Schrödinger cat state of the $N$ spins that is maximally entangled with the central spin, and show how this state can be adiabatically created and moved along the chain by driving the central spin. The Bell-cat states are visualized by plotting their Wigner function and we explore their robustness against random noise by solving the master equation for the density matrix. We also explain the essential topological difference between identical spins and the excitations of a bosonic mode.

Title: Symmetry-induced fragmentation and dissipative time crystal
Authors: Haowei Li, Wei Yi
Abstract: Time crystals are a peculiar state of matter. Their emergence hinges on ergodicity breaking, which typically originates from many-body localization or Floquet prethermalization. Here we propose a novel scheme for devising robust dissipative time crystals where the ergodicity is broken through symmetry-induced fragmentation. Building upon a U(1)-symmetry-induced Liouville-space fragmentation, we first propose a generic Liouvillian with long-time oscillations typical of time crystals. We then show that, even when the U(1) symmetry is broken, a prethermal time-crystal behavior survives, with distinct oscillation frequencies at different times of the steady-state approaching dynamics. Intriguingly, the stage-wise prethermal dynamics derive from Fermi statistics and the Liouvillian skin effect of our model -- as the excitations above the boundary-localized dark states can be mapped to the irreducible representations of the permutation group, the branching rules of the permutation group ensure the robustness of the prethermal time crystal. Our work paves the way for devising time crystals through Hilbert-space fragmentation. It also sheds light on the dynamic effects of non-Hermitian physics in many-body quantum open systems.

Title: Amplifying microwave pulses with a single qubit engine fueled by quantum measurements
Authors: Rémy Dassonneville, Cyril Elouard, Romain Cazali, Réouven Assouly, Audrey Bienfait, Alexia Auffèves, Benjamin Huard
Abstract: Recent progress in manipulating individual quantum systems enables the exploration of engines exploiting non-classical resources. One of the most appealing is the energy provided by the inherent backaction of quantum measurements. While a handful of experiments have investigated the inner dynamics of engines fueled by measurement backaction, powering a task by such an engine is missing. Here we demonstrate the amplification of microwave signals by an engine fueled by repeated quantum measurements of a superconducting transmon qubit. Using feedback, the engine acts as a quantum Maxwell demon operating without a hot thermal source. Measuring the gain of this amplification constitutes a direct probing of the work output of the engine, in contrast with inferring the work by measuring the qubit state along its evolution. Observing a good agreement between both work estimation methods, our experiment validates the accuracy of the indirect method. We characterize the long-term stability of the engine as well as its robustness to transmon decoherence, loss and drifts. Our experiment exemplifies the use of energy brought by quantum measurement backaction.

Title: Revealing the fuel of a quantum continuous measurement-based refrigerator
Authors: Cyril Elouard, Sreenath K. Manikandan, Andrew N. Jordan, Geraldine Haack
Abstract: While quantum measurements have been shown to constitute a resource for operating quantum thermal machines, the nature of the energy exchanges involved in the interaction between system and measurement apparatus is still under debate. In this work, we show that a microscopic model of the apparatus is necessary to unambiguously determine whether quantum measurements provide energy in the form of heat or work. We illustrate this result by considering a measurement-based refrigerator, made of a double quantum dot embedded in a two-terminal device, with the charge of one of the dots being continuously monitored. Tuning the parameters of the measurement device interpolates between a heat- and a work-fueled regimes with very different thermodynamic efficiency. Notably, we demonstrate a trade-off between a maximal thermodynamic efficiency when the measurement-based refrigerator is fueled by heat and a maximal measurement efficiency quantified by the signal-to-noise ratio in the work-fueled regime. Our analysis offers a new perspective on the nature of the energy exchanges occurring during a quantum measurement, paving the way for energy optimization in quantum protocols and quantum machines.

Title: A new representation formula for the logarithmic corotational derivative -- a case study in application of commutator based functional calculus
Authors: Michal Bathory, Miroslav Bulíček, Josef Málek, Vít Průša
Abstract: The logarithmic corotational derivative is a key concept in rate-type constitutive relations in continuum mechanics. The derivative is defined in terms of the logarithmic spin tensor, which is a skew-symmetric tensor/matrix given by a relatively complex formula. Using a newly developed commutator based functional calculus, we derive a new representation formula for the logarithmic spin tensor. In addition to the result on the logarithmic corotational derivative we also use the newly developed functional calculus to answer some problems regarding the matrix logarithm and the monotonicity of stress-strain relations. These results document that the commutator based functional calculus is of general use in tensor/matrix analysis, and that the calculus allows one to seamlessly work with tensor/matrix valued functions and their derivatives.

Title: How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte
Authors: Vinay Thakur, Prabhat Prakash, Raghavan Ranganathan
Abstract: Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.

Title: The Nuclear Route: Sharp Asymptotics of ERM in Overparameterized Quadratic Networks
Authors: Vittorio Erba, Emanuele Troiani, Lenka Zdeborová, Florent Krzakala
Abstract: We study the high-dimensional asymptotics of empirical risk minimization (ERM) in over-parametrized two-layer neural networks with quadratic activations trained on synthetic data. We derive sharp asymptotics for both training and test errors by mapping the $\ell_2$-regularized learning problem to a convex matrix sensing task with nuclear norm penalization. This reveals that capacity control in such networks emerges from a low-rank structure in the learned feature maps. Our results characterize the global minima of the loss and yield precise generalization thresholds, showing how the width of the target function governs learnability. This analysis bridges and extends ideas from spin-glass methods, matrix factorization, and convex optimization and emphasizes the deep link between low-rank matrix sensing and learning in quadratic neural networks.

Title: Bayes optimal learning of attention-indexed models
Authors: Fabrizio Boncoraglio, Emanuele Troiani, Vittorio Erba, Lenka Zdeborová
Abstract: We introduce the attention-indexed model (AIM), a theoretical framework for analyzing learning in deep attention layers. Inspired by multi-index models, AIM captures how token-level outputs emerge from layered bilinear interactions over high-dimensional embeddings. Unlike prior tractable attention models, AIM allows full-width key and query matrices, aligning more closely with practical transformers. Using tools from statistical mechanics and random matrix theory, we derive closed-form predictions for Bayes-optimal generalization error and identify sharp phase transitions as a function of sample complexity, model width, and sequence length. We propose a matching approximate message passing algorithm and show that gradient descent can reach optimal performance. AIM offers a solvable playground for understanding learning in self-attention layers, that are key components of modern architectures.

Title: DistMLIP: A Distributed Inference Platform for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Kevin Han, Bowen Deng, Amir Barati Farimani, Gerbrand Ceder
Abstract: Large-scale atomistic simulations are essential to bridge computational materials and chemistry to realistic materials and drug discovery applications. In the past few years, rapid developments of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have offered a solution to scale up quantum mechanical calculations. Parallelizing these interatomic potentials across multiple devices poses a challenging, but promising approach to further extending simulation scales to real-world applications. In this work, we present DistMLIP, an efficient distributed inference platform for MLIPs based on zero-redundancy, graph-level parallelization. In contrast to conventional spatial partitioning parallelization, DistMLIP enables efficient MLIP parallelization through graph partitioning, allowing multi-device inference on flexible MLIP model architectures like multi-layer graph neural networks. DistMLIP presents an easy-to-use, flexible, plug-in interface that enables distributed inference of pre-existing MLIPs. We demonstrate DistMLIP on four widely used and state-of-the-art MLIPs: CHGNet, MACE, TensorNet, and eSEN. We show that DistMLIP can simulate atomic systems 3.4x larger and up to 8x faster compared to previous multi-GPU methods. We show that existing foundation potentials can perform near-million-atom calculations at the scale of a few seconds on 8 GPUs with DistMLIP.

Title: Transient and steady-state chaos in dissipative quantum systems
Authors: Debabrata Mondal, Lea F. Santos, S. Sinha
Abstract: Dissipative quantum chaos plays a central role in the characterization and control of information scrambling, non-unitary evolution, and thermalization, but it still lacks a precise definition. The Grobe-Haake-Sommers conjecture, which links Ginibre level repulsion to classical chaotic dynamics, was recently shown to fail [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. We properly restore the quantum-classical correspondence through a dynamical approach based on entanglement entropy and out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which reveal signatures of chaos beyond spectral statistics. Focusing on the open anisotropic Dicke model, we identify two distinct regimes: transient chaos, marked by rapid early-time growth of entanglement and OTOCs followed by low saturation values, and steady-state chaos, characterized by high long-time values. We introduce a random matrix toy model and show that Ginibre spectral statistics signals short-time chaos rather than steady-state chaos. Our results establish entanglement dynamics and OTOCs as reliable diagnostics of dissipative quantum chaos across different timescales.

Title: Detecting (emergent) continuous symmetry of criticality via subsystem's entanglement spectrum
Authors: Bin-Bin Mao, Zhe Wang, Bin-Bin Chen, Zheng Yan
Abstract: The (emergent) symmetry of a critical point is one of the most important information to identify the universality class and effective field theory, which is fundamental for various critical theories. However, the underlying symmetry so far can only be conjectured indirectly from the dimension of the order parameters in symmetry-breaking phases, and its correctness requires further verifications to avoid overlooking hidden order parameters, which by itself is also a difficult task. In this work, we propose an unbiased way to numerically identify the underlying (emergent) symmetry of a critical point in quantum many-body systems, without prior knowledge about its low-energy effective field theory. Through calculating the reduced density matrix in a very small subsystem of the total system numerically, the Anderson tower of states in the entanglement spectrum clearly reflects the underlying (emergent) symmetry of the criticality. It is attributed to the fact that the entanglement spectrum can observe the broken symmetry of the entanglement ground-state after cooling from the critical point along an extra temperature axis.

Title: Trion quantum coherence in site-controlled pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots
Authors: R. A. Barcan, I. Samaras, K. Barr, G. Juska, E. Pelucchi, K. G. Lagoudakis
Abstract: Deterministically positioned pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) exhibit exceptional quantum properties, making them highly promising candidates for scalable on-chip quantum information processing. In this work, we investigate the coherent dynamics of positively charged excitons under the influence of strong magnetic fields in the Faraday configuration. Pyramidal quantum dots exhibit a fourfold splitting of the charged excitons even in the Faraday configuration, giving rise to an optically addressable double-Lambda{\Lambda} system akin to self-assembled quantum dots in oblique magnetic fields. Here, we investigate ultrafast complete coherent control of the trion to ground state transition utilizing advanced optical resonant excitation techniques and we observe quantum coherence over timescales that are similar to other prominent quantum dot platforms. These results pave the way towards establishing site-controlled pyramidal InGaAs QDs as scalable platforms for quantum information processing, expanding the reach of coherent control to new quantum systems.

Title: The neural networks with tensor weights and emergent fermionic Wick rules in the large-width limit
Authors: Guojun Huang, Kai Zhou
Abstract: In this paper, we study complex-valued neural network (CVNNs) with tensor-valued hidden-to-output weights within the framework of neural-network quantum field theory (NN-QFT). For standard CVNNs with scalar weights, we derive the generating functional and identify the exact Gaussian process that arises in the infinite-width limit, together with its associated effective quantum state. When the last-layer weights are promoted to Clifford-algebra-valued tensors, the network output becomes complex matrix-valued, and a fermion-like sign structure in the large-width correlation functions of the network output is induced. We show that, in the infinite-width limit, correlators with equal numbers of $f^†$ and $f$ obey fermionic Wick rules and can be written as determinants built from a scalar Euclidean kernel $S(x,y)=\langle f^†(x)f(y)\rangle$. This provides a sign-structured extension of NN-QFT at the level of Euclidean correlators and Feynman rules, even though a microscopic Grassmann path integral representation for the network parameters has not yet been constructed. Our analysis thus pushes the NN-QFT correspondence beyond purely bosonic Gaussian fields and suggests a possible route to encoding fermion-like symmetries in neural architectures for QFT correspondence.

Title: Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Inference of Liquid Structure from Scattering Data
Authors: Harry W. Sullivan, Brennon L. Shanks, Matej Cervenka, Michael P. Hoepfner
Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian framework to infer radial distribution functions from experimental scattering measurements with uncertainty quantification using non-stationary Gaussian processes. The Gaussian process prior mean and kernel functions are designed to mitigate well-known numerical challenges with the Fourier transform, including discrete measurement binning and detector windowing, while encoding fundamental yet minimal physical knowledge of liquid structure. We demonstrate uncertainty propagation of the Gaussian process posterior to unmeasured quantities of interest. Experimental radial distribution functions of liquid argon and water with uncertainty quantification are provided as both a proof of principle for the method and a benchmark for molecular models. The full implementation is available on GitHub at: this https URL.

Title: Linear Resistivity from Spatially Random Interactions and the Uniqueness of Yukawa Coupling
Authors: Sang-Jin Sin, Yi-Li Wang
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that a spatially random Yukawa-type interaction between a Fermi surface and critical bosons can produce linear-in-temperature resistivity, the defining signature of strange metals. In this article, we systematically classify all scalar couplings of the form $(\psi^{\dagger}\psi)^n\phi^m$ in arbitrary dimensions to identify possible candidates for strange-metal behaviour within this disordered framework. We find that only spatially random Yukawa-type interaction in $(2+1)$ dimensions can yield linear resistivity.

Title: When higher-order interactions enhance synchronization: the case of the Kuramoto model on random hypergraphs
Authors: Riccardo Muolo, Hiroya Nakao, Marco Coraggio
Abstract: Synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in complex systems, observed across a wide range of natural and engineered contexts. The Kuramoto model provides a foundational framework for understanding synchronization among coupled oscillators, traditionally assuming pairwise interactions. However, many real-world systems exhibit group and many-body interactions, which can be effectively modeled through hypergraphs. Previous studies suggest that higher-order interactions shrink the attraction basin of the synchronous state, making it harder to reach and potentially impairing synchronization, despite enriching the dynamics. In this work, we show that this is not always the case. Through a numerical study of higher-order Kuramoto models on random hypergraphs, we find that while strong higher-order interactions do generally work against synchronization, weak higher-order interactions can actually enhance it when combined with pairwise ones. This result is further corroborated by a cost-benefit analysis: under a constrained budget of both pairwise and higher-order interactions, a mixed allocation involving both consistently achieves higher synchronization than relying on either interaction type alone. These findings provide new insights into the role of higher-order interactions in shaping collective dynamics and point to design principles for optimizing synchronization in complex systems.

Title: Intrinsic non-Hermitian topological phases
Authors: Ken Shiozaki
Abstract: We study the interplay of non-Hermitian topological phases under point- and line-gap conditions. Using natural homomorphisms from line-gap to point-gap phases, we distinguish extrinsic phases, reducible to Hermitian or anti-Hermitian line-gapped phases, from intrinsic phases, which are genuinely non-Hermitian without Hermitian counterparts. Although classification tables for all symmetry classes were already presented in earlier work, the present paper develops a unified formulation and provides explicit computations for all internal symmetries.

Title: Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials
Authors: Shi Yin, Zujian Dai, Xinyang Pan, Lixin He
Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.

Abstract: Trained attention layers exhibit striking and reproducible spectral structure of the weights, including low-rank collapse, bulk deformation, and isolated spectral outliers, yet the origin of these phenomena and their implications for generalization remain poorly understood. We study empirical risk minimization in a single-head tied-attention layer trained on synthetic high-dimensional sequence tasks generated from the attention-indexed model. Using tools from random matrix theory, spin-glass theory, and approximate message passing, we obtain an exact high-dimensional characterization of training and test error, interpolation and recovery thresholds, and the spectrum of the key and query matrices. Our theory predicts the full singular-value distribution of the trained query-key map, including low-rank structure and isolated spectral outliers, in qualitative agreement with observations in more realistic transformers. Finally, for targets with power-law spectra, we show that learning proceeds through sequential spectral recovery, leading to the emergence of power-law scaling laws.

Title: Triadic percolation on multilayer networks
Authors: Hanlin Sun, Filippo Radicchi, Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: Triadic interactions are special types of higher-order interactions that occur when regulator nodes modulate the interactions between other two or more nodes. In presence of triadic interactions, a percolation process occurring on a single-layer network becomes a fully-fledged dynamical system, characterized by period-doubling and a route to chaos. Here, we generalize the model to multilayer networks and name it as the multilayer triadic percolation (MTP) model. We find a much richer dynamical behavior of the MTP model than its single-layer counterpart. MTP displays a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, leading to oscillations of arbitrarily large period or pseudo-periodic oscillations. Moreover, MTP admits period-two oscillations without negative regulatory interactions, whereas single-layer systems only display discontinuous hybrid transitions. This comprehensive model offers new insights on the importance of regulatory interactions in real-world systems such as brain networks, climate, and ecological systems.

Title: Frequency domain laser ultrasound for inertial confinement fusion target wall thickness measurements
Authors: Martin Ryzy, Guqi Yan, Clemens Grünsteidl, Georg Watzl, Kevin Sequoia, Pavel Lapa, Haibo Huang
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.

Title: Atomic-superfluid heat engines controlled by twisted light
Authors: Aritra Ghosh, Nilamoni Daloi, M. Bhattacharya
Abstract: We theoretically propose a quantum heat engine using a setup consisting of a ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate placed in a Fabry-Pérot cavity where the optical field carries orbital angular momentum. We first show that the cavity-enhanced light-atom coupling leads to the emergence of polaritonic modes whose character can be reversibly switched between photonlike and phononlike by detuning sweeps, allowing work extraction governed by distinct reservoirs. We investigate the dependence of the engine efficiency on the orbital angular momentum. Beyond ideality, we discuss finite-time scenarios based on shortcuts to adiabaticity such that the efficiency retains its ideal-operation value, despite finite-time operation. Our analysis identifies orbital angular momentum as a control knob that can reconfigure the performance of such quantum heat engines.

Title: Fast Evaluation of Unbiased Atomic Forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo via the Lagrangian Technique
Authors: Kousuke Nakano, Stefano Battaglia, Jürg Hutter
Abstract: Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations based on highly parallelizable stochastic frameworks for accurate solutions of the many-body Schr{ö}dinger equation, suitable for modern many-core supercomputer architectures. Despite its potential, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting dynamical properties of large systems or extensive datasets, is the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a mean-field method, such as Density Functional Theory. However, the proposed method has a significant drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires 6$N$ additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces. This paper presents a way to replace the 6$N$ DFT calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. We also demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the unbiased VMC forces with those obtained by CCSD(T) calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces are biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give values closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones. Our benchmark test also reveals that the unbiased VMC forces yield very consistent values with hybrid and meta GGAs, but do not necessarily yield values that are very close to those of CCSD(T).

Title: One-Loop Renormalization of Anisotropic Two-Scalar Quantum Field Theories
Authors: Dmitry S. Ageev, Yulia A. Ageeva
Abstract: We develop a basis--covariant one--loop renormalization framework for two interacting real scalars in $D=4-\epsilon$ with the most general two--derivative Lorentz--violating quadratic form, allowing anisotropic spatial gradients and direction--dependent kinetic mixing, together with general cubic and quartic interactions forming RG complete set of operators at one-loop. In dimensional regularization with minimal subtraction we compute the full set of one--loop UV divergences and obtain closed beta functions for quartic and cubic couplings, masses. The pole coefficients admit a universal spectral representation as angular averages over the direction--dependent eigenvalues and projectors of the UV kinetic matrix; all anisotropy dependence enters through a single universal kernel admitting two--particle phase--space interpretation. We classify fixed points and fixed manifolds and show, in particular, that anisotropy restricts the existence of the coupled Wilson--Fisher--type fixed point. When the cross--gradients are turned on the coefficients in beta functions are governed by six phase--space weights admitting interpretation in terms of encoding ``populations'' and ``coherences'' of the UV normal modes.

Title: Bose polarons as relativistic Unruh-DeWitt detectors: Entanglement harvesting from Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: T. Rick Perche, Francesco Gozzini, Markus K. Oberthaler
Abstract: We show that a bound impurity in a Bose-Einstein condensate can be directly mapped to an Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a relativistic quantum field. We provide explicit experimental parameters for an implementation using ${}^{39}\text{K}$ impurities coupled to a ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ condensate via finite-time Feshbach tuning. As an application, we study the extraction of vacuum entanglement from distant regions of the condensate and find viable parameters for the implementation of entanglement harvesting.

Title: Semiclassical Canovaccio for Composite Operators
Authors: Oleg Antipin, Jahmall Bersini, Jacob Hafjall, Giulia Muco, Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We present a novel semiclassical framework tailored to determine the scaling dimensions of heavy neutral composite operators in conformal field theories (CFTs) which are inaccessible with other current methodologies. It utilizes the state-operator correspondence to map the desired scaling dimensions to the semiclassical energy spectrum of periodic homogeneous field configurations on a cylinder. As concrete applications, we provide detailed analyses for the $\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions and $\phi^6$ near three dimensions, semiclassically determining the full spectrum of neutral operators in the traceless symmetric Lorentz representations. Our methodology is presented pedagogically and is readily applicable to a vast class of CFTs.

Title: Universal Digitized Counterdiabatic Driving
Authors: Takuya Hatomura
Abstract: Counterdiabatic driving realizes parameter displacement of an energy eigenstate of a given parametrized Hamiltonian using the adiabatic gauge potential. In this paper, we propose a universal method of digitized counterdiabatic driving, constructing the adiabatic gauge potential in a digital way with the idea of universal counterdiabatic driving. This method has three advantages over existing universal counterdiabatic driving and/or digitized counterdiabatic driving: it does not introduce any many-body and/or nonlocal interactions to an original target Hamiltonian; it can incorporate infinite nested commutators, which constitute the adiabatic gauge potential; and it gives explicit expression of rotation angles for digital implementation. We show the consistency of our method to the exact theory in an analytical way and the effectiveness of our method with the aid of numerical simulations.

Title: A Scalable Measure of Loss Landscape Curvature for Analyzing the Training Dynamics of LLMs
Authors: Dayal Singh Kalra, Jean-Christophe Gagnon-Audet, Andrey Gromov, Ishita Mediratta, Kelvin Niu, Alexander H Miller, Michael Shvartsman
Abstract: Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($\lambda_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $\Delta \mathbf{\theta}$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.

Title: Holstein Primakoff spin codes for local and collective noise
Authors: Sivaprasad Omanakuttan, Tyler Thurtell, Andrew K. Forbes, Vikas Buchemmavari, Ben Q. Baragiola
Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet most existing codes rely on local control and stabilizer measurements that are difficult to implement in systems dominated by collective interactions. Inspired by spin-GKP codes in PhysRevA.108.022428, we develop a general framework for Holstein-Primakoff spin codes, which maps continuous-variable bosonic codes onto permutation-symmetric spin ensembles via the Holstein-Primakoff approximation. We show that HP codes are robust to both collective and local-spin noise and propose an explicit measurement-free local error recovery procedure to map local noise into correctable collective-spin errors.

Title: Resolving Gauge Ambiguities of the Berry Connection in Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Ievgen I. Arkhipov
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems display spectral and topological phenomena absent in Hermitian physics; yet, their geometric characterization can be hindered by an intrinsic ambiguity rooted in the eigenspace of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which becomes especially pronounced in the pure quantum regime. Because left and right eigenvectors are not related by conjugation, their norms are not fixed, giving rise to a biorthogonal ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ gauge freedom. Consequently, the standard Berry connection admits four inequivalent definitions depending on how left and right eigenvectors are paired, giving rise to distinct Berry phases and generally complex-valued holonomies. Here we show that these ambiguities and the emergence of complex phases are fully resolved by introducing a covariant-derivative formalism built from the metric tensor of the Hilbert space of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The resulting uniquely defined Berry connection remains real-valued under an arbitrary ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ frame change, and transforms as an affine gauge potential, while reducing to the conventional Berry (or Wilczek-Zee) connection in the Hermitian limit. This establishes an unambiguous and gauge-consistent geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in quantum systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.

Title: Non-Equilibrium Phase Transition in a Boundary-Driven Dissipative Fermionic Chain
Authors: Hao Chen, Wucheng Zhang, Manas Kulkarni, Abhinav Prem
Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary-localized periodic (Floquet) drive can induce nontrivial long-range correlations in a non-interacting fermionic chain which is additionally subject to boundary dissipation. Surprisingly, we find that this phenomenon occurs even when the corresponding isolated bulk is in a trivial gapped phase with exponentially decaying correlations. We argue that this boundary-drive induced non-equilibrium transition (as witnessed through the correlation matrix) is driven by a resonance mechanism whereby the drive frequency bridges bulk energy gaps, allowing boundary-injected particles and holes to propagate and mediate long-range correlations into the bulk. We also numerically establish that when the drive bridges a particle-hole gap, the induced long-range order scales as a power law with the bulk pairing potential ($\chi \sim \gamma^2$). Our results highlight the potential of localized coherent driving for generating macroscopic order in open quantum systems.

Title: Convergent Discovery of Critical Phenomena Mathematics Across Disciplines: A Cross-Domain Analysis
Authors: Bruce Stephenson, Robin Macomber
Abstract: Techniques for detecting critical phenomena -- phase transitions where correlation length diverges and small perturbations have large effects -- have been developed across at least eight fields of application over nine decades. We document this convergence pattern. The physicist's correlation length $\xi$, the cardiologist's DFA scaling exponent $\alpha$, the financial analyst's Hurst exponent $H$, and the machine learning engineer's spectral radius $\chi$ all measure correlation decay rate, detecting the same critical signatures under different notation. Citation analysis reveals minimal cross-domain awareness during the formative period (1987--2010): researchers in biomedicine, finance, machine learning, power systems, and traffic flow developed equivalent techniques independently, each with distinct notation and terminology. We present Metatron Dynamics, a framework derived from distributed systems engineering, as a candidate ninth independent discovery -- strengthening the convergence pattern while acknowledging that as authors of both the framework and this analysis, external validation would strengthen this claim. Correspondence testing on the 2D Ising model confirms that measures from multiple frameworks correctly identify the critical regime at $T_c = 2.269$. We argue that repeated independent discovery establishes criticality mathematics as fundamental public knowledge, with implications for cross-disciplinary education and research accessibility. Because these findings affect fields beyond mathematics and physics, we include a plain-language summary in Appendix B for non-specialist readers.
