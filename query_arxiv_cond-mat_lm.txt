Title: Curvature-Guided Mechanics and Design of Spinodal and Shell-Based Architected Materials
Authors: Somayajulu Dhulipala, Carlos M. Portela
Abstract: Additively manufactured (AM) architected materials have enabled unprecedented control over mechanical properties of engineered materials. While lattice architectures have played a key role in these advances, they suffer from stress concentrations at sharp joints and bending-dominated behavior at high relative densities, limiting their mechanical efficiency. Additionally, high-resolution AM techniques often result in low-throughput or costly fabrication, restricting manufacturing scalability of these materials. Aperiodic spinodal architected materials offer a promising alternative by leveraging low-curvature architectures that can be fabricated through techniques beyond AM. Enabled by phase separation processes, these architectures exhibit tunable mechanical properties and enhanced defect tolerance by tailoring their curvature distributions. However, the relation between curvature and their anisotropic mechanical behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to quantify the role of curvature in governing the anisotropic stiffness and strength of shell-based spinodal architected materials. We introduce geometric metrics that predict the distribution of stretching and bending energies under different loading conditions, bridging the gap between curvature in doubly curved shell-based morphologies and their mechanical anisotropy. We validate our framework through finite element simulations and microscale experiments, demonstrating its utility in designing mechanically robust spinodal architectures. This study provides fundamental insights into curvature-driven mechanics, guiding the optimization of next-generation architected materials for engineering applications.

Title: Triplon Bose-Einstein condensation and proximate magnetism in dimerized antiferromagnets
Authors: Z. Y. Zhao, F. Y. Li, C. Dong, R. Chen, M. Y. Cui, Z. W. Ouyang, J. F. Wang, Y. Kohama, Z. Z. He, Gang v. Chen
Abstract: Dimerized quantum magnets provide a useful arena for novel quantum states and phases transitions with the singlet-triplet type of triplon excitations. Here we study the triplon physics and the Bose-Einstein condensation in two isostructural dimerized antiferromagnets $A$Cu(SeO$_3$)$_2$ ($A$ = Hg, Cd). With the systematic measurements, we demonstrate a dimer singlet ground state in HgCu(SeO$_3$)$_2$ with a triplon gap $\sim$ 7.9 K and a triplon Bose-Einstein condensation with an antiferromagnetic order in CdCu(SeO$_3$)$_2$ below 4.4 K. We further adopt the bond-operator technique and show that the elemental replacement preserves the Hamiltonian and allows the study in a unified theoretical framework with tunable interdimer and intradimer interactions on the opposite sides of the quantum critical point. With the peculiar Cu$_2$O$_8$ dimer configuration and effective ferromagnetic interdimer interaction, $A$Cu(SeO$_3$)$_2$ is distinguished from other $S$ = 1/2 dimerized antiferromagnets. Our results represent a global understanding of the magnetic ground states as well as the magnetic transitions in the dimerized magnets of this unusual crystal structure.

Title: Family of Multilayer Graphene Superconductors with Tunable Chirality: Momentum-Space Vortices Forged in the Berry-Ring of Fire
Authors: Adarsh S. Patri, Marcel Franz
Abstract: Recent experiments in rhombohedrally-stacked multilayer graphene heterostructures have reported signatures of chiral superconductivity, emerging from a spin and valley-polarized normal state with broken time-reversal symmetry and an associated anomalous Hall effect. These findings bring into focus the role of the electronic Bloch wavefunction and the quantum geometric tensor in determining the superconducting pairing channel. In this work, we examine superconducting instabilities of a model of $N$-layer rhombohedral graphene that possesses an enhanced Berry curvature distribution on an extended ring in momentum space $-$ that we dub the 'Berry-ring of fire' $-$ in the presence of an isotropic attractive interaction with a parametrically controlled spatial range. We determine that local interactions favor a $N$-fold winding in the order parameter phase for odd-$N$ layered systems, with even-$N$ layers requiring a spatially extended attraction range to achieve pairing. For generic interaction lengths, we discover a family of chiral superconductors and, remarkably, momentum-space vortices nucleated on the Berry-ring of fire. The existence of these vortices can be traced to a momentum-space flux quantization condition involving the Berry curvature, with the phase winding dictated by a combination of the Berry flux and a 'statistical flux' to enforce Fermi-Dirac statistics. Such an order parameter structure allows for the possibility of in-situ tuning between various chiral superconducting phases through changes in the electron density or the displacement field. We discuss ways in which these predictions can be experimentally tested and potentially exploited in future devices.

Title: Valence-bonds, spin liquids and unconventional criticality in a 1D Kondo insulator
Authors: Nai Chao Hu, Rui-Zhen Huang, Nick Bultinck
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional multi-orbital Kondo lattice model and show that by tuning the kinetic energy of the itinerant electrons it is possible to stabilize Kondo insulators with non-trivial spin physics. In particular, depending on the size of the exchange coupling between the local moments, we find kinetic-energy-driven transitions between a featureless Kondo insulator and a valence-bond solid or a gapless spin liquid. We also provide evidence for an unconventional continuous phase transition between two featureless Kondo insulators distinguished by their quantum numbers under reflection symmetry.

Title: Interplay between Hund's rule and Kondo effect in a quantum dot
Authors: Olfa Dani, Johannes C. Bayer, Timo Wagner, Gertrud Zwicknagl, Rolf J. Haug
Abstract: The interaction between localized spins on a quantum dot and free electrons in the reservoirs forms a many-particle entangled system giving rise to the Kondo effect. Here, we investigate electron transport in the third shell of a gate-defined GaAs quantum dot. The addition energy shows a maximum at half-filling of the shell which can be described analytically with Hund's rule exchange interaction. For 7 to 11 electrons occupying the quantum dot Zero-bias anomalies characteristic for the Kondo effect are observed, but with unexpected widths. Here the quantum dot has to be described as a multi-orbital Kondo impurity with Hund's interaction. In this way this quantum dot can be seen as a model system for a Hund's coupled mixed-valence quantum impurity as appearing in Hund's metals where local ferromagnetic interactions between orbitals lead to the emergence of complex electronic states.

Title: Anisotropic electron damping and energy gap in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$
Authors: Jiemin Li, Yanhong Gu, Takemi Yamada, Zebin Wu, Genda Gu, Tonica Valla, Ilya Drozdov, Ivan Bozovic, Mark P. M. Dean, Takami Tohyama, Jonathan Pelliciari, Valentina Bisogni
Abstract: The many body electron-electron interaction in cuprates causes the broadening of the electronic bands in \textit{\textbf{k}}-space, leading to a deviation from the standard Fermi liquid. While a \textit{\textbf{k}}-dependent anisotropic electronic scattering (\textit{\textbf{k}}-DAES) has been assessed by photoemission, its fingerprint in \textit{\textbf{Q}}-space has been scarcely considered. Here, we explore the \textit{\textbf{Q}}-dependent electron dynamics in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ through the evolution of low-energy charge excitations as measured by resonant inelastic x ray scattering (RIXS). In the normal state, the RIXS spectra display a continuum of excitations down to 0~meV, while the superconducting state features a spectral weight suppression below 80 meV without any enhancement at higher energies. To interpret the energy and \textit{\textbf{Q}}-evolution of our data, we introduce a phenomenological expression of the charge susceptibility by including the \textit{\textbf{k}}-DAES. We show that only the charge susceptibility with \textit{\textbf{k}}-DAES captures the RIXS data, highlighting the importance of \textit{\textbf{k}}-DAES when describing the \textit{\textbf{Q}}-dependence of charge excitations from 0 to few eV scale. Furthermore, we also find that the inclusion of \textit{\textbf{k}}-DAES is essential when quantitative parameters such as the electronic energy gap are extracted from RIXS data.

Title: Rolling, sliding and trapping of driven particles in square obstacle lattices
Authors: Galor Geva, Arin Escobar, Paula Magrinya, Pablo Llombart, Alfredo Alexander-Katz, Laura R. Arriaga, Juan L. Aragones
Abstract: Transport phenomena in complex and dynamic microscopic environments are fundamentally shaped by hydrodynamic interactions. In particular, microparticle transport in porous media is governed by the delicate interplay between particle-substrate friction and pressure forces. Here, we systematically investigate the motion of externally driven rotating magnetic microparticles near a substrate patterned with a square lattice of cylindrical obstacles, a model porous medium. Remarkably, we observe a reversal in the direction of particle translation as obstacle spacing decreases, highlighting a sensitive competition between shear-induced forward rolling and pressure-driven backward sliding due to flow-field symmetry breaking. These results demonstrate the crucial role of structured environments in determining microscale active particle transport, offering novel strategies for microfluidic design, targeted cargo delivery, and tunable active materials.

Title: The Memory Engine: Self-Organized Coherence from Internal Feedback
Authors: Aranyak Sarkar
Abstract: We present a continuous-space realization of the Coupled Memory Graph Process (CMGP), a minimal non-Markovian framework in which coherence emerges through internal feedback. A single Brownian particle evolves on a viscoelastic substrate that records its trajectory as a scalar memory field and exerts local forces via the gradient $\nabla$ of accumulated imprints. This autonomous, closed-loop dynamics generates structured, phase-locked motion without external forcing. The system is governed by coupled integro-differential equations: the memory field evolves as a spatiotemporal convolution of the particle's path, while its velocity responds to the gradient of this evolving field. Simulations reveal a sharp transition from unstructured diffusion to coherent burst-trap cycles, controlled by substrate stiffness and marked by multimodal speed distributions, directional locking, and spectral entrainment. This coherence point aligns across three axes: (i) saturation of memory energy, (ii) peak transfer entropy, and (iii) a bifurcation in transverse stability. We interpret this as the emergence of a \textit{memory engine} -- a self-organizing mechanism converting stored memory into predictive motion -- illustrating that coherence arises not from tuning, but from coupling.

Title: Enhanced Neel temperature and unusual thermal expansion in flux-grown FeCrAs crystals
Authors: Michael A. McGuire, Matthew S. Cook, Brenden R. Ortiz, Jiaqiang Yan, Andrew F. May
Abstract: We report results from our experimental investigation of the distorted-kagome compound FeCrAs. For this work, we developed a procedure using tin metal as a flux to produce needlelike crystals. The crystals were characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction as well as measurements of magnetization, electrical transport, and heat capacity. The physical behaviors are generally similar to published results on crystals grown from a stoichiometric melt with two notable exceptions. The Sommerfeld coefficient is found to be 18 mJ/K2/mol, a little more than half of the previously reported value, and the Neel temperature is found to be 150 K, about 25K higher than in previous reports. The reason for these discrepancies are uncertain, but they may be related to differences in stoichiometry or disorder; it is expected that the Cr/Fe ratio has some variability in this compound. In addition, we find unusual thermal expansion behavior, with an anomaly at the Neel temperature and nearly temperature independent thermal expansion along the hexagonal c-axis above this transition. This suggests significant spin-lattice coupling, which may provide insight into non-metallic transport properties that have been associated with anomalous charge carrier scattering.

Title: Viscoelasticity of biomimetic scale beams from trapped complex fluids
Authors: Pranta Rahman Sarkar, Outi Tammisola, Ranajay Ghosh
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of a biomimetic scale-covered beam in which shear-dependent complex fluids are trapped between overlapping scales under bending loads. These fluids mimic biological mucus and slime layers commonly enveloping the skins found in nature. An energy-based analytical model is developed to quantify the interplay between substrate elasticity, scale geometry, and fluid rheology at multiple length scales. Constant strain rate and oscillatory bending are examined for Newtonian, shear-thinning, and shear-thickening fluids. The analysis reveals unique, geometry- and rate-dependent viscoelastic response, distinct from classical mechanisms such as material dissipation, frictional resistance, or air drag. Energy dissipation is shown to emerge from a nonlinear coupling of tribological parameters, fluid rheology, and system kinematics, exhibiting distinct regime-differentiated characteristics. The model captures the competitions and cooperations between elastic and geometrical parameters to influence the viscoelastic behavior and lead to geometry and rheology scaling laws for relative energy dissipation. The pronounced nonlinearity in the moment-curvature relationships, along with the geometry-controlled regimes of performance, highlights the potential for using tailored and engineered complex inks for soft robotics and smart damping systems.

Title: Magnetic $2π$ domain walls for tunable Majorana devices
Authors: Daniel Hauck, Stefan Rex, Markus Garst
Abstract: Identifying realistic platforms capable of controlled operations with Majorana bound states is a key challenge in the study of topological superconductivity. Among the most promising proposals are magnet-superconductor hybrid devices, which employ magnetic textures to engineer regions of non-trivial topology. Here, we consider the remarkably simple case of $2\pi$ domain walls in a magnetic ribbon placed on a superconducting substrate. We show that for properly chosen parameters, such domain walls generate topological quasi-one dimensional superconducting wires and give rise to localized Majorana bound states at the ribbon edges. Magnetic $2\pi$ domain walls are easily created and controlled with existing experimental techniques, thus providing a versatile platform for Majorana manipulations.

Title: Active Hyperuniform Networks of Chiral Magnetic Micro-Robotic Spinners
Authors: Jing Wang, Zihao Sun, Huaicheng Chen, Gao Wang, Duyu Chen, Guo Chen, Jianwei Shuai, Mingcheng Yang, Yang Jiao, Liyu Liu
Abstract: Disorder hyperuniform (DHU) systems possess a hidden long-range order manifested as the complete suppression of normalized large-scale density fluctuations like crystals, which endows them with many unique properties. Here, we demonstrate a new organization mechanism for achieving stable DHU structures in active-particle systems via investigating the self-assembly of robotic spinners with three-fold symmetric magnetic binding sites up to a heretofore experimentally unattained system size, i.e., with $\sim 1000$ robots. The spinners can self-organize into a wide spectrum of actively rotating three-coordinated network structures, among which a set of stable DHU networks robustly emerge. These DHU networks are topological transformations of a honeycomb network by continuously introducing the Stone-Wales defects, which are resulted from the competition between tunable magnetic binding and local twist due to active rotation of the robots. Our results reveal novel mechanisms for emergent DHU states in active systems and achieving novel DHU materials with desirable properties.

Title: Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality: Solving Configurational Integrals for Crystalline Solids by Tensor Networks
Authors: Duc P. Truong, Benjamin Nebgen, Derek DeSantis, Dimiter N. Petsev, Kim Ø. Rasmussen, Boian S. Alexandrov
Abstract: Accurately evaluating configurational integrals for dense solids remains a central and difficult challenge in the statistical mechanics of condensed systems. Here, we present a novel tensor network approach that reformulates the high-dimensional configurational integral for identical-particle crystals into a sequence of computationally efficient summations. We represent the integrand as a high-dimensional tensor and apply tensor-train (TT) decomposition together with a custom TT-cross interpolation scheme. This approach avoids the need to explicitly construct the full tensor, which would otherwise be computationally intractable. We introduce tailored rank-1 and rank-2 schemes optimized for sharply peaked Boltzmann probability densities, typical in crystalline solids. When applied to the calculation of internal energy and pressure-temperature curves for crystalline copper (Cu) and argon (Ar), as well as the alpha-to-beta phase transition in tin (Sn), our method accurately reproduces molecular dynamics simulation results using tight-binding, machine learning (HIP-NN), and MEAM potentials, all within seconds of computation time.

Title: Robust and Symmetric Magnetic Field Dependency of Superconducting Diode Effect in Asymmetric Dirac Semimetal SQUIDs
Authors: H.C. Travaglini, J.J. Cuozzo, K.R. Sapkota, I.A. Leahy, A.D. Rice, K. Alberi, W. Pan
Abstract: The recent demonstration of the superconducting diode effect (SDE) has generated renewed interests in superconducting electronics in which devices such as compact superconducting diodes that can perform signal rectification where low-energy operations are needed. In this article, we present our results of robust and symmetric-in-magnetic-field SDE in asymmetric superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) realized in high-quality Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 thin film grown by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique. Consistent with previous work, a zero magnetic field SDE is observed. Furthermore, the difference in switching current is independent of the strength and polarity of an out-plane magnetic field in the range of -10 mT and 10 mT. We speculate that this robust symmetric-in-field SDE in our Dirac semimetal SQUIDs is due to the formation of helical spin texture, theoretically predicted in Dirac semimetals.

Title: Stoichiometry control and epitaxial growth of AgCrSe2 thin films by pulsed-laser deposition
Authors: Yusuke Tajima, Kenshin Inamura, Sebun Masaki, Takumi Yamazaki, Takeshi Seki, Kazutaka Kudo, Jobu Matsuno, Junichi Shiogai
Abstract: We report on epitaxial growth in thin-film synthesis of a polar magnetic semiconductor AgCrSe2 on lattice-matched yttria-stabilized zirconia (111) substrate by pulsed-layer deposition (PLD). By using Ag-rich PLD target to compensate for Ag deficiency in thin films, the nucleation of impurity phases is suppressed, resulting in the c-axis-oriented and single-phase AgCrSe2 thin film. Structural analysis using x-ray diffraction and cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals epitaxial growth with the presence of both twisted and polar domains. Optical absorbance spectrum and magnetization measurements show absorption edge at around 0.84 eV and magnetic transition temperature at 41 K, respectively. These values are consistent with the reported values of direct bandgap and Néel temperature of bulk AgCrSe2, reflecting a single-phase and stoichiometric feature of the obtained film. Our demonstration of epitaxial thin-film growth of AgCrSe2 serves as a bedrock for exploration of its potential thermoelectric and spintronic functionalities at surface or heterointerfaces.

Title: Theory of itinerant collisional spin dynamics in nondegenerate molecular gases
Authors: Reuben R. W. Wang, John L. Bohn
Abstract: We study the fully itinerant dynamics of ultracold but nondegenerate polar molecules with a spin-$1/2$ degree of freedom encoded into two of their electric field dressed rotational states. Center of mass molecular motion is constrained to two-dimensions via tight confinement with a one-dimensional optical lattice, but remains mostly unconstrained within the plane. The pseudospins can become entangled through ultracold dipolar collisions, for which the locality of interactions is greatly relaxed by free molecular motion. At the level of single-molecule observables, collision-induced entanglement manifests as spin decoherence, for which our theoretical calculations serve well to describe recent Ramsey contrast measurements of quasi-2D confined KRb molecules at JILA [A. Carroll et al., Science 388 6745 (2025)]. In presenting a more detailed theoretical analysis of the KRb experiment, we highlight a key finding that molecular loss enhanced by particle exchange symmetry can lead to a suppression of collective spin decoherence, a mechanism with refer to as ``loss-induced quantum autoselection". We then show that by utilizing bialkali species with sufficiently large dipole moments, loss can be near completely suppressed in all collision channels via electric field tunable confinement-induced collisional shielding. The afforded collisional stability permits fully coherent spin mixing dynamics, natively realizing unitary circuit dynamics with random all-to-all connectivity and U(1) charge conservation. This work establishes a bridge between the domains of ultracold molecular collisions and many-body spin physics, ultimately proposing the use of nondegenerate bulk molecular gases as a controllable platform for nonequilibrium explorations of itinerant quantum matter.

Title: Exact Quantum Many-Body Scars in 2D Quantum Gauge Models
Authors: Yuan Miao, Linhao Li, Hosho Katsura, Masahito Yamazaki
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) serve as important examples of ergodicity-breaking phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Despite recent extensive studies, exact QMBS are rare in dimensions higher than one. In this paper, we study a two-dimensional quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model that is dual to a two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ XY model defined on bipartite graphs. We identify the exact eigenstates of the XY model with a tower structure as exact QMBS. Exploiting the duality transformation, we show that the exact QMBS of the XY model (and XXZ model) after the transformation are the exact QMBS of the dual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model. This construction is versatile and has potential applications for finding new QMBS in other higher-dimensional models.

Title: Universal principles for sudden-quench quantum Otto engines
Authors: R. S. Watson, K. V. Kheruntsyan
Abstract: We apply a simple sudden quench approximation for the unitary work strokes of a quantum Otto engine in order to provide a general analysis of its performance, applicable to arbitrary quantum models with two-body interactions. This work extends recent results for an interaction-driven Otto cycle to generic many-body interacting quantum models, providing universal bounds on their operation efficiency. From this, we demonstrate that the net work of such an engine cycle is determined entirely by interparticle correlations. Applications are demonstrated for a handful of paradigmatic many-body quantum models, including a novel engine -- with a spin-1/2 Fermi gas with contact two-body interactions as its working medium -- in which we leverage control over spin polarization to greatly enhance its performance compared to the unpolarized case. We then extend the analysis of interaction-driven quantum Otto engine cycles to systems where control is exerted over the strength of arbitrary quantum operators that might be present in the system Hamiltonian (such as one-body, or three-body, etc.), finding that the general principles derived for the sudden quench with two-body interactions apply universally. As an example, this is demonstrated for a conventional volumetric Otto cycle, where beneficial net work is generated by leveraging the control over the frequency of an external trap, which is a one-body operator. However, we emphasize that the results derived here apply universally to all Otto engine cycles operating under a sudden quench protocol.

Title: Stress distribution in elastic disks with a hole under uniaxial compression
Authors: Ken Okamura, Yosuke Sato, Satoshi Takada
Abstract: This paper investigates the stress and displacement distribution in a two-dimensional elastic hollow disk subjected to distributed diametric loading, extending our previous analysis of concentrated loading [Okamura et al. Strength Mater. 57, 102-114 (2025)]. The study provides deeper insights into the mechanical behavior of materials such as concrete and rock by examining the effects of load distribution on stress localization and displacement patterns. Using elastodynamic theory, we derive the static stress distributions and identify key differences from the concentrated loading case, particularly in the locations and magnitudes of stress extrema. This work contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of stress behavior in elastic disks under realistic loading conditions.

Title: Sr$_2$NbO$_4$: A $4d$ analogue of the layered perovskite Sr$_2$VO$_4$
Authors: Leonid S. Taran, Anastasia E. Lebedeva, Sergey V. Streltsov
Abstract: This work focuses on the layered perovskite Sr$_2$NbO$_4$, a 4$d$ analogue of Sr$_2$VO$_4$, which remains an unsolved puzzle with a possible intriguing hidden magnetic order. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate the robust thermodynamic stability and exfoliability of Sr$_2$NbO$_4$, suggesting potential applications as a 2D material. Imperfect Fermi surface nesting indicates instabilities that may drive symmetry lowering, charge/orbital density waves, or superconductivity. Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations reveal moderate mass renormalization $(m^*/m\sim1.3)$ and an itinerant character of magnetism with strong longitudinal spin fluctuations. The exchange interaction is dominated by in-plane ferromagnetic coupling with much weaker interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange.

Title: Systematic generation of electron models for Second-Principles Density Functional Theory Methods
Authors: Nayara Carral-Sainz, Toraya Fernández-Ruiz, Jorge Íñiguez, Javier Junquera, Pablo Garcia-Fernandez
Abstract: We present a systematic, quasi-automated methodology for generating electronic models in the framework of second-principles density functional theory (SPDFT). This approach enables the construction of accurate and computationally efficient models by deriving all necessary parameters from first-principles calculations on a carefully designed training set. A key feature of our method is the enforcement of space group symmetries, which reduces both the number of independent parameters and the required computational effort. The formalism includes improved treatments of one-electron Hamiltonians, electron-lattice coupling-through both linear and quadratic terms-and electron-electron interactions, enabling accurate modeling of structural and electronic responses. We apply the methodology to SrTiO$_{3}$ and LiF, materials representative of transition-metal perovskites and wide-band-gap insulators, respectively. In both cases, the resulting models reproduce DFT reference data with high fidelity across various atomic configurations and charge states. Our results validate the robustness of the approach and highlight its potential for simulating complex phenomena such as polarons and excitons. This work lays the foundation for extending SPDFT to real-time simulations of optoelectronic properties and further integration with machine-learning methods.

Title: The experimental determination of exchange mass terms in surface states on both terminations of MnBi4Te7
Authors: Dezhi Song, Fuyang Hang, Gang Yao, Jun Zhang, Ye-Ping Jiang, Jin-Feng Jia
Abstract: The intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological insulators in the Mn-Bi-Te family, composed of superlattice-like MnBi2Te4/(Bi2Te3)n (n = 0, 1, 2, 3...) layered structure, present intriguing states of matter such as quantum anomalous Hall effect and the axion insulator. However, the surface state gap, which is the prerequisite for the observation of these states, remains elusive. Here by molecular beam epitaxy, we obtain two types of MnBi4Te7 films with the exclusive Bi2Te3 (BT) or MnBi2Te4 (MBT) terminations. By scanning tunneling spectroscopy, the mass terms in the surface states are identified on both surface terminations. Experimental results reveal the existence of a hybridization gap of approximately 23 meV in surface states on the BT termination. This gap comes from the hybridization between the surface states and the spin-split states in the adjacent MBT layer. On the MBT termination, an exchange mass term of about 30 meV in surface states is identified by taking magnetic-field-dependent Landau level spectra as well as theoretical simulations. In addition, the mass term varies with the field in the film with a heavy BiMn doping level in the Mn layers. These findings demonstrate the existence of mass terms in surface states on both types of terminations in our epitaxial MnBi4Te7 films investigated by local probes.

Title: Influence of thickness on magnetic properties of RF-sputtered amorphous CoNbZr thin films
Authors: Indujan Sivanesarajaha, Leon Abelmann, Uwe Hartmann
Abstract: Amorphous sputtered Co-based thin films are widely used as soft magnetic materials in applications such as sensors, inductors and magnetic flux concentrators. The magnetic properties of these films can be controlled by deposition parameters like film thickness, argon pressure, deposition rate and others. In this study, we present a detailed investigation of the magnetic properties of RF-sputtered Co$_{91}$Nb$_7$Zr$_2$ films with thicknesses ranging from 52 nm to 1040 nm. These amorphous films exhibit an average saturation magnetisation of 1.01(4) MA/m. As the film thickness increases, there is a significant decrease in coercivity, remanent-to-saturation magnetisation ratio M$_r$/M$_s$, and maximum permeability. The change in macroscopic magnetic properties is also reflected by the domain structure. At a thickness of 52 nm, the remanent domain state shows irregular domains, while films thicknesses above 208 nm exhibit flux-closure domain structures instead. The thickness-dependent modifications are attributed to the transition between Néel and Bloch type domain walls, which is expected to occur at approximately 84 nm.

Title: Effective potential and scattering length of shielding polar molecules
Authors: Peng Xu, Gang Chen
Abstract: We investigate the effective potential and scattering length of ultracold polar molecules under different shielding techniques. First, we derive the effective potential for two polar molecules in the presence of an elliptical polarization field, combined elliptical and linear polarization fields, and combined elliptical polarization and static fields. The effective potential is then expressed as a sum of a zero-range contact interaction and a long-range dipole-dipole interaction under the Born approximation. We find that the first two shielding methods only partially suppress attractive interactions, while the second method allows for the construction of bound states with different polarization shapes. The last shielding method can achieve complete cancellation of residual attractive forces, which is particularly significant for maintaining quantum degeneracy in ultracold dipolar systems. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the effective potential and scattering length of shielding polar molecules, which is crucial for studying many-body physics in ultracold dipolar systems.

Title: Fractional Quantum Hall Anyons via the Algebraic Topology of Exotic Flux Quanta
Authors: Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall systems (FQH), due to their experimentally observed anyonic topological order, are a main contender for future hardware-implementation of error-protected quantum registers ("topological qbits") subject to error-protected quantum operations ("topological quantum gates"), both plausibly necessary for future quantum computing at useful scale, but both remaining insufficiently understood. Here we present a novel non-Lagrangian effective description of FQH anyons, based on previously elusive proper global quantization of effective topological flux in extraordinary non-abelian cohomology theories. This directly translates the system's quantum-observables, -states, -symmetries, and -measurement channels into purely algebro-topological analysis of local systems of Hilbert spaces over the quantized flux moduli spaces. Under the hypothesis -- for which we provide a fair bit of evidence -- that the appropriate effective flux quantization of FQH systems is in 2-Cohomotopy theory (a cousin of Hypothesis H in high-energy physics), the results here are rigorously derived and as such might usefully inform laboratory searches for novel anyonic phenomena in FQH systems and hence for topological quantum hardware.

Title: Critical and Nonpercolating Phases in Bond Percolation on the Song-Havlin-Makse Network
Authors: Kazuki Wataya, Takehisa Hasegawa
Abstract: We investigate bond percolation on the Song-Havlin-Makse (SHM) network, a scale-free tree with a tunable degree exponent and dimensionality. Using a generating function approach, we analytically derive the average size and the fractal exponent of the root cluster for deterministic cases. Our analysis reveals that bond percolation on the SHM network remains in a nonpercolating phase for all $p < 1$ when the network is fractal (i.e., finite-dimensional), whereas it exhibits a critical phase, where the cluster size distribution follows a power-law with a $p$-dependent exponent, throughout the entire range of $p$ when the network is small-world (i.e., infinite-dimensional), regardless of the specific dimensionality or degree exponent. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Anomalous Hall Effect in Thick Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ Weyl Semimetal Crystals
Authors: Eddy Divin Kenvo Songwa, Shaday Jesus Nobosse Nguemeta, Hodaya Gabber, Renana Aharonof, Dima Cheskis
Abstract: Ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals with Kagome lattice structures exhibit a strong coupling between magnetism and topological band features. Co3Sn2S2 is a prime example, showing a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE) driven by Berry curvature from the Weyl nodes. We investigated the temperature and angular dependence of Hall conductivity in thick Co3Sn2S2 crystals, aiming to distinguish between topological and conventional magnetic contributions. Our measurements reveal a robust Hall response even at low magnetic fields and temperatures above 77 K, suggesting a dominant topological origin and weak sensitivity to external conditions.

Title: Quantum Effects at a Spin-Flop Transition in the Antiferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$
Authors: V.V. Val'kov, A.O. Zlotnikov, A. Gamov, N.A. Fedorova, F.N. Tomilin
Abstract: It is shown that the experimentally detected features in the low-temperature behavior of the magnetization in an external magnetic field perpendicular to the layers of manganese ions of the topological antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ are due to quantum effects induced by the off-diagonal nature of the trigonal component of the crystal field. In this case, the anomalous increase in the magnetization of the material before the spin-flop transition, as well as after it in the phase of "collapsed" sublattices, is explained by the suppression of contributions from quantum effects. The comparison of the results of the theoretical analysis with experimental data has made it possible to refine the parameters of the effective spin model of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and to establish the important role of the noted trigonal component.

Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity is emerging as a distinct and promising mechanism for realizing ferroelectricity in low-dimensional systems, offering new design principles beyond the conventional ferroelectric mechanism. Further, the coexistence of the out-of-plane polarization with in-plane conductivity induced by electrostatic charge doping makes these systems strong candidates for realizing ferroelectric metals. Using density functional theory calculations, we analyze the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based Janus sliding ferroelectric bilayers XMY (M = Mo, W; X, Y = S, Se, Te; X $\neq$ Y). In addition to exhibiting switchable interlayer polarization, Janus sliding ferroelectrics possess an intrinsic electric field within each monolayer, arising from the electronegativity difference between the chalcogen atoms. We discover that the intrinsic electric field of the monolayers can be used to modulate the interlayer ferroelectric polarization and the electronic band structure. We identify the decrease in the interlayer distance due to a particular stacking of the Janus bilayers as a major contributor to increasing polarization and reducing the bandgap. The direction of the intrinsic electric field within the Janus monolayers plays a significant role in the modulation of layer-wise contribution in the valence and conduction bands, which influences the polarization reduction due to extrinsic charge dopants. Extending this concept to Janus trilayers, we observe further enhancement in polarization and additional bandgap reduction compared to their bilayer counterparts. These results highlight the tunability of TMD-based Janus sliding ferroelectrics and suggest a pathway for designing low bandgap ferroelectrics and potential ferroelectric metals.

Title: Unified Magnetoelectric Mechanism for Spin Splitting in Magnets
Authors: Carlos Mera Acosta
Abstract: We identify a relativistic magnetoelectric correction that unifies the understanding of spin splitting (SS) in ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and altermagnets. Based on Dirac theory, we show that local electric multipoles coupled to magnetic moments govern SS across compensated magnets, leading to quadrupole-, dipole-, or monopole-driven regimes. Our model predicts momentum-dependent and momentum-independent SS, reconciling seemingly distinct phenomena such as altermagnetism and the spin Zeeman effect. This work establishes a general physical mechanism for SS beyond conventional Zeeman and Rashba paradigms.

Title: Finite-size effects of the excess entropy computed from integrating the radial distribution function
Authors: Darshan Raju, Mahinder Ramdin, Jean-Marc Simon, Peter Kruger, Thijs J.H. Vlugt
Abstract: Computation of the excess entropy from the second-order density expansion of the entropy holds strictly for infinite systems in the limit of small densities. For the reliable and efficient computation of excess entropy, it is important to understand finite-size effects. Here, expressions to compute excess entropy and Kirkwood-Buff (KB) integrals by integrating the Radial Distribution Function (RDF) in a finite volume are derived, from which Sex and KB integrals in the thermodynamic limit are obtained. The scaling of these integrals with system size is studied. We show that the integrals of excess entropy converge faster than KB integrals. We compute excess entropy from Monte Carlo simulations using the Wang-Ramirez-Dobnikar-Frenkel pair interaction potential by thermodynamic integration and by integration of the RDF. We show that excess entropy computed by integrating the RDF is identical to that of excess entropy computed from thermodynamic integration at low densities, provided the RDF is extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit. At higher densities, differences up to 20% are observed.

Title: Cluster sizes, particle displacements and currents in transport mediated by solitary cluster waves
Authors: Alexander P. Antonov, Annika Vonhusen, Artem Ryabov, Philipp Maass
Abstract: In overdamped particle motion across periodic landscapes, solitary cluster waves can occur at high particle densities and lead to particle transport even in the absence of thermal noise. Here we show that for driven motion under a constant drag, the sum of all particle displacements per soliton equals one wavelength of the periodic potential. This unit displacement law is used to determine particle currents mediated by the solitons. We furthermore derive properties of clusters involved in the wave propagation as well as relations between cluster sizes and soliton numbers.

Title: Subsystem Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases from Subsystem SymTFT of 2-Foliated Exotic Tensor Gauge Theory
Authors: Qiang Jia, Zhian Jia
Abstract: Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, posits a correspondence between symmetries in a $d$-dimensional theory and topological order in a $(d+1)$-dimensional theory. In this work, we extend this framework to subsystem symmetries and develop subsystem SymTFT as a systematic tool to characterize and classify subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases. For $(2+1)$D gapped phases, we introduce a 2-foliated $(3+1)$D exotic tensor gauge theory (which is equivalent to 2-foliated $(3+1)$D BF theory via exotic duality) as the subsystem SymTFT and systematically analyze its topological boundary conditions and linearly rigid subsystem symmetries. Taking subsystem symmetry groups $G = \mathbb{Z}_N$ and $G=\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ as examples, we demonstrate how to recover the classification scheme $\mathcal{C}[G] = H^{2}(G^{\times 2}, U(1)) / \left( H^2(G, U(1)) \right)^3$, which was previously derived by examining topological invariant under linear subsystem-symmetric local unitary transformations in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism. To illustrate the correspondence between field-theoretic and lattice descriptions, we further analyze $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ cluster state models as concrete examples.

Title: Forager with Inertia : Better for Survival?
Authors: Md Aquib Molla, Sanchari Goswami, Parongama Sen
Abstract: We study the fate of a forager who searches for food performing simple random walk on lattices. The forager consumes the available food on the site it visits and leaves it depleted but can survive up to $S$ steps without food. We introduce the concept of inertia in the dynamics which allows the forager to rest with probability $p$ upon consumption of food. The parameter $p$ significantly affects the lifetime of the forager, showing that the inertia can be beneficial for the forager for chosen parameter values. The study of various other quantities reveals interesting scaling behavior with $p$ and also departure from usual diffusive behavior for $0.5 < p < 1$. In addition to numerical approach, the problem has also been studied with analytical approach in one dimension and the results agree reasonably well.

Title: Ultrasonic spin pumping in the antiferromagnetic acoustic resonator $α-\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$

Abstract: Recent advances in magnon spintronics have ignited interest in the interactions between the spin and elastic subsystems of magnetic materials. These interactions suggest a dynamic connection between collective excitations of spins, quantized as magnons, and elastic waves generated by perturbations in the crystal lattice, quantized as phonons. Both magnons and their associated magnon-phonon excitations can act as sources of spin pumping from magnetic materials into non-magnetic metals. Although a considerable body of research has focused on spin pumping via elastic waves in ferromagnets, similar investigations involving antiferromagnets have yet to be undertaken. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of generating spin currents at ultrasonic frequencies of acoustic resonance in antiferromagnetic crystal hematite $\alpha-\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$ at room temperature. We provide both theoretical and experimental evidence that, due to strong magnetoelastic coupling, acoustic vibrations in hematite induce significant variable deviations in magnetization, resulting in spin accumulation at the antiferromagnet-normal metal interface, which in turn leads to the generation of spin and charge currents in the metal. Charge currents arising from the inverse spin Hall effect can be measured using the same methodology employed under high-frequency spin pumping conditions at the resonances of the magnetic subsystem itself. Moreover, the acoustic resonance in hematite is significantly more pronounced (by hundreds or even thousands of times) than in other quasiferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic systems, enabling the attainment of extremely large amplitudes of magnetic oscillations for spin pumping. This research highlights the new approach of utilizing acoustic spin pumping to manipulate spin currents in magnetic materials, particularly antiferromagnets.

Title: Dimensionality-Driven Anomalous Metallic State with Zero-field Nonreciprocal Transport in Layered Ising Superconductors
Authors: Yanwei Cui, Zenglin Liu, Qin Liu, Junlin Xiong, Yongqin Xie, Yudi Dai, Ji Zhou, Lizheng Wang, Hanyan Fang, Haiwen Liu, Shi-Jun Liang, Bin Cheng, Feng Miao
Abstract: The anomalous metal state (AMS), observed in failed superconductors, provides insights into superconductivity and quantum criticality, with studies revealing unconventional quantum phases like the Bose metal. Recently, layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors approaching the two-dimensional limit have garnered significant attention for the enhanced phase fluctuations and electronic correlations. Investigating AMS in these systems, particularly in the absence of an external magnetic field, could offer valuable insights into the dimensionality-driven emergence of exotic quantum phenomena, including triplet Cooper pairing, phase fluctuation dynamics, and especially the recently discovered field-free superconducting diode effects. However, the field-free AMS has yet to be observed in TMD superconductors. Here, we report the dimensionality-tunable AMS near the superconducting quantum phase transitions in a layered TMD superconductor 2H-Ta2S3Se. In samples with thicknesses below 10 nm, we demonstrate magnetic field-driven AMS under external magnetic field, characterized by the vanishing of the Hall resistance and the presence of finite longitudinal resistance. Remarkably, an unexpected zero-field AMS emerges as the sample thickness is reduced to 3 nm. This AMS aligns well with the quantum vortex creep model and exhibits non-reciprocal transport behaviors, suggesting the onset of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking accompanied by vortex motion as the system approaches the two-dimensional limit. Our findings open new avenues for exploring dimensionality-driven exotic superconducting quantum critical phases, and pave the way for a deeper understanding of zero-field superconducting diode effects.

Title: Engineering Ge profiles in Si/SiGe heterostructures for increased valley splitting
Authors: Lucas E. A. Stehouwer, Merrit P. Losert, Maia Rigot, Davide Degli Esposti, Sara Martí-Sánchez, Maximillian Rimbach-Russ, Jordi Arbiol, Mark Friesen, Giordano Scappucci
Abstract: Electron spin qubits in Si/SiGe quantum wells are limited by the small and variable energy separation of the conduction band valleys. While sharp quantum well interfaces are pursued to increase the valley splitting energy deterministically, here we explore an alternative approach to enhance the valley splitting on average. We grow increasingly thinner quantum wells with broad interfaces to controllably increase the overlap of the electron wave function with Ge atoms. In these quantum wells, comprehensive quantum Hall measurements of two-dimensional electron gases reveal a linear correlation between valley splitting and disorder. Benchmarked against quantum wells with sharp interfaces, we demonstrate enhanced valley splitting while maintaining a low-disorder potential environment. Simulations using the experimental Ge concentration profiles predict an average valley splitting in quantum dots that matches the enhancement observed in two-dimensional systems. Our results motivate the experimental realization of quantum dot spin qubits in these heterostructures.

Title: Ageing correlators from local scale-invariance
Authors: Malte Henkel, Stoimen Stoimenov
Abstract: For ageing systems with dynamical exponent $\mathpzc{z}=2$ and with the dominant noise coming from the thermal bath, the form of the two-time autocorrelator as well as the time-space form of the single-time correlator are derived from Schrödinger-invariance, generalised to non-equilibrium ageing. These findings reproduce the exact results in the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model at $T=0$ and the critical spherical model in $d>2$ dimensions.

Title: Anti-bosonic current in thermal spin pumping
Authors: Adam B. Cahaya
Abstract: We investigate thermal spin pumping in gadolinium iron garnet, focusing on dynamics of antiferromagnetic magnon and its impact on spin and heat transport. Antiferromagnet has right-handed and left-handed magnon modes. Using a two-magnetic-lattice model, we derive temperature-dependent spin-wave spectra and thermal spin pumping constants, revealing distinct transport regimes governed by competing contribution of magnon modes. We show that competition of both modes induces a compensation temperature in thermally generated spin current. This theoretical framework deepens the understanding of spin-caloritronic effects in ferrimagnets, offering new perspectives for spintronic device optimization.

Title: Magnon thermal Hall effect in insulating antiferromagnets
Authors: Vladimir A. Zyuzin
Abstract: In this paper we theoretically discuss thermal Hall effect of magnons in insulating Néel ordered antiferromagnets at zero external magnetic field. We show that non-zero thermal Hall effect requires absence of any symmetry between the two sublattices. The thermal Hall effect of magnons will be non-zero by a virtue of the spin-momentum splitting of the magnon spectrum due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as well as anisotropic second-nearest exchange interaction different in the two sublattices, both corresponding to the broken symmetry. We construct a theoretical model in which an external electric field may change the symmetry of the antiferromagnetic system thus altering the thermal Hall effect of magnons.

Title: Localization behavior in a Hermitian and non-Hermitian Raman lattice
Authors: Entong Zhao, Yu-Jun Liu, Ka Kwan Pak, Peng Ren, Mengbo Guo, Chengdong He, Gyu-Boong Jo
Abstract: We introduce a flexible Raman lattice system for alakaline-earth like atoms to investigate localization behaviors in a quasi-periodic lattice with controllable non-Hermiticity. We demonstrate that critical phases and mobility edges can arise by adjusting spin-dependence of the incommensurate potentials in the Hermitian regime. With non-Hermiticity introduced by spin-selective atom loss, we find the localization behaviour in this system can be suppressed by dissipation. Our work provides insights into interplay between quasi-periodicity and non-Hermitian physics, offering a new perspective on localization phenomena.

Title: Indirect Magnetoelectric Coupling via Skew Scattering by Orbital Angular Momentum
Authors: Adam B. Cahaya
Abstract: Recent experimental observations of exchange bias in the La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$/LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ heterostructure, which lacks an intrinsic antiferromagnetic layer, have sparked theoretical investigations into the underlying mechanisms. While traditional theories suggest that exchange bias in spin valve structures is mediated by conduction electrons in metallic spacers, the transport properties of LaAlO$3$ are dominated by its valence electrons, raising new questions about the origin of this phenomenon. In this work, we propose a theoretical model where the electronic band structure of LaAlO$_3$ is treated as a valence band perturbed by skew scattering, which is sensitive to orbital angular momentum. Our analysis reveals a significant magnetoelectric effect at the La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$/LaAlO$_3$ interface, which induces a coupling between the interface magnetization and the electric field from two dimensional electron gas at LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ interface. This magnetoelectric coupling is found to drive the observed exchange bias, highlighting the role of electric polarization in influencing the magnetic properties of the heterostructure.

Title: Observation of resistive switching and diode effect in the conductivity of TiTe2 point contacts
Authors: O. E. Kvitnitskaya, L. Harnagea, O. D. Feia, D. V. Efremov, B. Büchner, Yu. G. Naidyuk
Abstract: We measured the I(V) and dV/dI(V) characteristics of TiTe2-based point contacts (PCs) from room to helium temperatures. Features indicating the emergence of a charge density wave (CDW) were detected. They represent symmetrical relatively V=0 maxima in dV/dI(V) around 150 mV at liquid helium temperatures, which disappear above 150 K, similar to the case of sister CDW compound TiSe2. Applying higher voltages above 200 mV, we observed resistive switching in TiTe2 PCs from a metallic-like low-resistance state to non-metallic type high-resistance state with a change of resistance by an order of magnitude. A unique diode-like effect was registered in "soft" TiTe2 PCs with hysteretic I(V) at negative voltage on TiTe2. Discovering the resistive switching and diode effect adds TiTe2 to the transition-metal dichalcogenides, which could be useful in developing non-volatile ReRAM and other upcoming nanotechnologies.

Title: Emergence of Diverse Topological States in Ge Doped MnBi2Te4
Authors: Zhijian Shi, Shengjie Xu, Jianfeng Wang, Yi Du, Weichang Hao
Abstract: As an ideal platform for studying interplays between symmetry, topology and magnetism, the magnetic topological insulator (MTI) MnBi2Te4 has attracted extensive attentions. However, its strong n-type intrinsic defects hinder the realizations of exotic phenomena. Stimulated by recent discoveries that Ge doping can efficiently tune the position of Fermi level, here we systematically investigate the band evolution and topological phase diagram with doping concentration from MTI MnBi2Te4 to strong topological insulator GeBi2Te4. Different from magnetically doped Bi2Se3, the topology here is determined by competition of two band inversions arising from band folding of two time-reversal invariant momenta between antiferromagnetic and nonmagnetic/ferromagnetic unit cells. By employing a band momentum mapping method, besides the known MTI phase, remarkably, we find two classes of magnetic Dirac semimetal phases at antiferromagnetic state, two classes of Weyl semimetal phases at ferromagnetic state, and an intermediate trivial state at different doping regions. Interestingly, the trivial state can be tuned into a Weyl phase with two coexisting band inversions and extraordinarily long Fermi arcs by a small strain. Our work reveals diverse topological states with intrinsic quantum phenomena can be achieved with great potential for designing future electronic devices.

Title: Synaptic shot-noise triggers fast and slow global oscillations in balanced neural networks
Authors: Denis S. Goldobin, Maria V. Ageeva, Matteo di Volo, Ferdinand Tixidre, Alessandro Torcini
Abstract: Neural dynamics is determined by the transmission of discrete synaptic pulses (synaptic shot-noise) among neurons. However, the neural responses are usually obtained within the diffusion approximation modeling synaptic inputs as continuous Gaussian noise. Here, we present a rigorous mean-field theory that encompasses synaptic shot-noise for sparse balanced inhibitory neural networks driven by an excitatory drive. Our theory predicts new dynamical regimes, in agreement with numerical simulations, which are not captured by the classical diffusion approximation. Notably, these regimes feature self-sustained global oscillations emerging at low connectivity (in-degree) via either continuous or hysteretic transitions and characterized by irregular neural activity, as expected for balanced dynamics. For sufficiently weak (strong) excitatory drive (inhibitory feedback) the transition line displays a peculiar re-entrant shape revealing the existence of global oscillations at low and high in-degrees, separated by an asynchronous regime at intermediate levels of connectivity. The mechanisms leading to the emergence of these global oscillations are distinct: drift-driven at high connectivity and cluster activation at low connectivity. The frequency of these two kinds of global oscillations can be varied from slow (around 1 Hz) to fast (around 100 Hz), without altering their microscopic and macroscopic features, by adjusting the excitatory drive and the synaptic inhibition strength in a prescribed way. Furthermore, the cluster-activated oscillations at low in-degrees could correspond to the gamma rhythms reported in mammalian cortex and hippocampus and attributed to ensembles of inhibitory neurons sharing few synaptic connections [G. Buzsaki and X.-J. Wang, Annual Review of Neuroscience 35, 203 (2012)].

Title: Weak valley-layer coupling and valley polarization in centrosymmetric $\mathrm{FeCl_2}$ monolayer
Authors: San-Dong Guo, Liguo Zhang, Xiao-Shu Guo, Gangqiang Zhu
Abstract: Using the valley degree of freedom as a carrier of information for storage and processing, valley polarization plays a crucial role. A variety of mechanisms for valley polarization have been proposed, among which the valley-layer coupling mechanism involves the induction of valley polarization by an out-of-plane electric field. Here, through first-principles calculations, it is found that the weak valley-layer coupling can exist in centrosymmetric $\mathrm{FeCl_2}$ monolayer. It is crucial to note that valley-layer coupling only occurs with out-of-plane magnetization and vanishes with in-plane magnetization. Compared to monolayers with strong valley-layer coupling, $\mathrm{FeCl_2}$ requires an extremely strong electric field to achieve the same magnitude of valley splitting. Valley polarization switching can be achieved by manipulating the directions of magnetization and electric field. Reversing only one of these directions switches the valley polarization, whereas reversing both simultaneously leaves it unchanged. Moreover, the simply stacked bilayer $\mathrm{FeCl_2}$, as a $PT$-antiferromagnet, can spontaneously achieve valley polarization without an external electric field, highlighting its potential for miniaturization, ultradensity, and ultrafast performance. Our work provides guidelines for identifying materials with weak valley-layer coupling, and further enables the regulation of valley polarization through electric field and stacking engineering.

Title: Precision Measurement of Spin-Dependent Dipolar Splitting in $^6$Li p-Wave Feshbach Resonances
Authors: Shuai Peng, Sijia Peng, Lijun Ren, Shaokun Liu, Bin Liu, Jiaming Li, Le Luo
Abstract: The magnetic dipolar splitting of a p-wave Feshbach resonance is governed by the spin-orbital configuration of the valence electrons in the triplet molecular state. We perform high-resolution trap loss spectroscopy on ultracold 6Li atoms to resolve this splitting with sub-milligauss precision. By comparing spin-polarized (|mS| = 1) and spin-mixture (mS = 0) configurations of the triplet state, we observe a clear spin-dependent reversal in the splitting structure, confirmed via momentumresolved absorption imaging. This behavior directly reflects the interplay between electron spin projection mS and orbital angular momentum ml in the molecular states. Our results provide a stringent benchmark for dipole-dipole interaction models and lay the groundwork for controlling the pairing in p-wave superfluid systems.

Title: Structural Hole Traps in III-V Quantum Dots
Authors: Ezra Alexander, Alexandra Alexiu, Matthias Kick, Troy Van Voorhis
Abstract: Non-toxic III-V quantum dots (QDs) are plagued with a higher density of performance-limiting trap states than II-VI and IV-VI QDs. Such trap states are generally understood to arise from under-coordinated atoms on the QD surface. Here, we present computational evidence for, and an exploration of, trap states in InP and GaP QDs that arise from fully-coordinated atoms with distorted geometries, denoted here as structural traps. In particular, we focus on the properties of anion-centered hole traps, which we show to be relatively insensitive to the choice of the (typically cation-coordinating) ligand. Through interpolation of trap center cutouts, we arrive at a simple molecular orbital (MO) argument for the existence of structural traps, finding two main modalities: bond stretches and angular distortion to a see-saw-like geometry. These structural trap states will be important for understanding the low performance of III-V QDs, as even core-shell passivation may not remove these defects unless they can rigidify the structure. Moreover, they may lead to interesting dynamical properties as distorted structures could form transiently.

Title: Robustness of topological edge states in open alternating spin chains
Authors: Alexander Sattler, Maria Daghofer
Abstract: Both the Haldane spin-$1$ chain and dimerized chains of spin-$1/2$ exhibit topologically protected edge states that are robust against specific perturbations. Recently, such spin chains have been specifically assembled on surfaces and we investigate here the robustness of these edge states against coupling to the surface. Since no physical system can be considered perfectly isolated, it is crucial to examine whether topological robustness is maintained in the presence of environmental coupling. We apply exact diagonalization to a Lindblad master equation that couples an alternating Heisenberg spin chain based on spins $1/2$ to a surface via various jump operators. The robustness of topological states is assessed via the time evolution of quantities such as the ground-state degeneracy, correlation function, entropy, and magnetization of edge states. We investigate chains built from dimers with antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic intra-dimer coupling, which resemble Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Haldane models, resp., and assess the impact of $z$-axis anisotropy and longer-ranged couplings. Generally, we find that signatures of topological properties are more robust in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like chains than in Haldane-like chains.

Title: Enantiosensitive locking of photoelectron spin and cation orientation
Authors: Philip Caesar M. Flores, Stefanos Carlström, Serguei Patchkovskii, Andres F. Ordonez, Olga Smirnova
Abstract: When electrons pass through chiral molecules, their transmission is strongly influenced by the orientation of their spin: molecules with opposite handedness preferentially transmit electrons with oppositely aligned spins. The underlying nature of this striking phenomenon, known as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), remains controversial: its observed strength far surpasses predictions based on the typically weak spin-orbit interaction. A significant fraction of CISS phenomena are driven by light, and thus could be controlled at the ultrafast scale, and impact chemical change following photoionization or photoexcitation. To date, most studies of spin-selective enantio-sensitive photodynamics have concentrated on the influence of the magnetic field component of light. Here, we establish \textit{dynamical} and \textit{geometric} mechanisms of spin-selective photo-induced dynamics that arise purely from electric dipole interactions. Using one-photon ionization as an example, we report a new effect: enantio-sensitive locking of molecular cation orientation to the spins of the photoelectron and the hole in the parent molecule. One-photon ionization is an ubiquitous process, where CISS has already been found in oriented samples. Remarkably, the new effect that we report here emerges upon photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules, establishing CISS in amorphous chiral media.

Title: X-ray View of Light-Induced Spin Reorientation in TmFeO$_{3}$: Direct Observation of a 90$^\circ$ Néel Vector Rotation
Authors: Somnath Jana, Ronny Knut, Dima Afanasiev, Niko Pontius, Christian Schüßler-Langeheine, Christian Tzschaschel, Daniel Schick, Alexey V. Kimel, Olof Karis, Clemens von Korff Schmising, Stefan Eisebitt
Abstract: Using time-resolved X-ray magnetic linear dichroism in reflection, we provide a direct probe of the Néel vector dynamics in TmFeO$_3$ on a ultrafast timescale. Our measurements reveal that, following optical excitation, the Néel vector undergoes a spin reorientation transition primarily within the a-c plane, completing a full 90° rotation within approximately 20 ps. This study highlights the ability to probe dynamics of antiferromagnets at its intrinsic timescale in reflection geometry, paving the way for investigations of a wide range of antiferromagnets grown on application relevant substrates.

Title: Quantum transport phenomena induced by time-dependent fields
Authors: Matteo Acciai, Liliana Arrachea, Janine Splettstoesser
Abstract: We present an overview of time-dependent transport phenomena in quantum systems, with a particular emphasis on steady-state regimes. We present the ideas after the main theoretical frameworks to study open-quantum systems out of equilibrium, that are useful to study quantum transport under time-dependent driving. We discuss the fundamentals of the key mechanisms such as dissipation, quantum pumping, noise, and energy conversion that are associated to the problem of quantum transport. Our primary focus is on electronic systems, where decades of research have established a rich theoretical foundation and a wealth of experimental realizations. Topics of interest include quantum optics with electrons, high-precision electron spectroscopy, quantum electrical metrology, and the critical role of quantum fluctuations in transport and thermodynamics. We also extend the discussion to atomic, molecular, and optical systems, as well as nanomechanical platforms, which offer complementary perspectives and are currently experiencing rapid experimental development. Finally, we examine the intersection of time-dependent transport and topological matter, a domain of active investigation. This review aims to gather the diverse approaches and emerging trends that define the current landscape of quantum transport research under time-dependent conditions, bridging theoretical insights with experimental advances across multiple physical platforms.

Title: Raman Optical Activity Induced by Ferroaxial Order in $\textrm{NiTiO}_3$
Authors: Gakuto Kusuno, Takeshi Hayashida, Takayuki Nagai, Hikaru Watanabe, Rikuto Oiwa, Tsuyoshi Kimura, Takuya Satoh
Abstract: Raman optical activity (ROA) -- the dependence of Raman scattered light intensity on the circular polarization of incident and scattered light -- has traditionally been associated with chiral molecules and magnetic materials. In this study, we demonstrate that ROA can also arise in ferroaxial materials that possess spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries. Using circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy on single-crystalline $\textrm{NiTiO}_3$, we observed a pronounced ROA signal in the cross-circular polarization configuration, which correlates with the ferroaxial domain structure. Our symmetry analysis and tight-binding model calculations reveal that the natural ROA (NROA) originates from the ferroaxial order and persists even within the electric dipole approximation. These results establish ROA as a powerful probe of ferroaxial order in centrosymmetric systems.

Title: Enhanced thermopower in two-dimensional ruthenium dichalcogenides $RuX_2$ (X = S, Se): a first-principles study
Authors: Parbati Senapati, Ajay Kumar, Prakash Parida
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered attention for their potential in thermoelectric applications due to their unique electronic properties and tunable bandgaps. In this study, we systematically explore the electronic and thermoelectric properties of $T^{\prime}-RuX_2$ (X = S, Se) using first-principles calculations and semi-classical Boltzmann transport equations. Our findings confirm that $T^{\prime}-RuX_2$ is energetically and mechanically stable, with high thermopower values such that $T^{\prime}-RuS_2$ exhibits a Seebeck coefficient of $2685~\mu V/K$ for hole doping and $2585~\mu V/K$ for electron doping, while $T^{\prime}-RuSe_2$ shows values of $1515~\mu V/K$ and $1533~\mu V/K$ for hole and electron doping, respectively. Both materials exhibit reasonable power factors and $ZT$ values, with p-type $T^{\prime}-RuS_2$ and $T^{\prime}-RuSe_2$ achieving maximum ZT values of 0.85 and 0.87, respectively, at 1200~K along the y-direction. These results highlight $T^{\prime}$-$RuS_2$ and $T^{\prime}$-$RuSe_2$ as promising candidates for high-temperature TMD-based thermoelectric devices.

Abstract: Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) serve as nutrient reservoirs in egg yolk for embryonic development and as promising drug carriers. Both roles critically depend on their mobility in densely crowded biological environments. Under these crowded conditions, diffusion is hindered by transient confinement within dynamic cages formed by neighboring particles, driven by solvent-mediated hydrodynamic interactions and memory effects -- phenomena that have remained challenging to characterize computationally and experimentally. Here, we employ megahertz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to directly probe the cage dynamics of LDLs in yolk-plasma across various concentrations. We find that LDLs undergo anomalous diffusion, experiencing $\approx$ 100-fold reduction in self-diffusion at high concentrations compared to dilute solutions. This drastic slowing-down is attributed to a combination of hydrodynamic interactions, direct particle-particle interactions, and the inherent softness of LDL particles. Despite reduced dynamics, yolk-plasma remains as a liquid, yet sluggish, balancing dense packing, structural stability, and fluidity essential for controlled lipid release during embryogenesis.

Title: Nonlinear time-reversal symmetry breaking in kagome spin ice HoAgGe
Authors: Kan Zhao, Hao Deng, Hua Chen, Nvsen Ma, Noah Oefele, Jiesen Guo, Xueling Cui, Chen Tang, Matthias J. Gutmann, Thomas Mueller, Yixi Su, Vladimir Hutanu, Changqing Jin, Philipp Gegenwart
Abstract: Kagome spin ice is an intriguing class of spin systems constituted by in-plane Ising spins with ferromagnetic interaction residing on the kagome lattice, theoretically predicted to host a plethora of magnetic transitions and excitations. In particular, different variants of kagome spin ice models can exhibit different sequences of symmetry breaking upon cooling from the paramagnetic to the fully ordered ground state. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the frustrated intermetallic HoAgGe stands as a faithful solid-state realization of kagome spin ice. Here we use single crystal neutron diffuse scattering to map the spin ordering of HoAgGe at various temperatures more accurately and surprisingly find that the ordering sequence appears to be different from previously known scenarios: From the paramagnetic state, the system first enters a partially ordered state with fluctuating magnetic charges, in contrast to a charge-ordered paramagnetic phase before reaching the fully ordered state. Through state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations and scaling analyses using a quasi-2D model for the distorted Kagome spin ice in HoAgGe, we elucidate a single three-dimensional (3D) XY phase transition into the ground state with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS). However, the 3D XY transition has a long crossover tail before the fluctuating magnetic charges fully order. More interestingly, we find both experimentally and theoretically that the TRS breaking phase of HoAgGe features an unusual, hysteretic response: In spite of their vanishing magnetization, the two time-reversal partners are distinguished and selected by a nonlinear magnetic susceptibility tied to the kagome ice rule. Our discovery not only unveils a new symmetry breaking hierarchy of kagome spin ice, but also demonstrates the potential of TRS-breaking frustrated spin systems for information technology applications.

Title: Prediction and Synthesis of Mg$_4$Pt$_3$H$_6$: A Metallic Complex Transition Metal Hydride Stabilized at Ambient Pressure

Abstract: The low-pressure stabilization of superconducting hydrides with high critical temperatures ($T_c$s) remains a significant challenge, and experimentally verified superconducting hydrides are generally constrained to a limited number of structural prototypes. Ternary transition-metal complex hydrides (hydrido complexes)-typically regarded as hydrogen storage materials-exhibit a large range of compounds stabilized at low pressure with recent predictions for high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Motivated by this class of materials, we investigated complex hydride formation in the Mg-Pt-H system, which has no known ternary hydride compounds. Guided by ab initio structural predictions, we successfully synthesized a novel complex transition-metal hydride, Mg$_4$Pt$_3$H$_6$, using laser-heated diamond anvil cells. The compound forms in a body-centered cubic structural prototype at moderate pressures between 8-25 GPa. Unlike the majority of known hydrido complexes, Mg$_4$Pt$_3$H$_6$ is metallic, with formal charge described as 4[Mg]$^{2+}$.3[PtH$_2$]$^{2-}$. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements obtained during decompression reveal that Mg$_4$Pt$_3$H$_6$ remains stable upon quenching to ambient conditions. Magnetic-field and temperature-dependent electrical transport measurements indicate ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c$ (50%) = 2.9 K, in reasonable agreement with theoretical calculations. These findings clarify the phase behavior in the Mg-Pt-H system and provide valuable insights for transition-metal complex hydrides as a new class of hydrogen-rich superconductors.

Title: Observation of Coherent Ferrons

Abstract: Excitation of ordered phases produces quasiparticles and collective modes, as exemplified by magnons that emerge from magnetic order, with applications in information transmission and quantum interconnects. Extending this paradigm to ferroelectric materials suggests the existence of ferrons, i.e. fundamental quanta of the collective excitation of ferroelectric order5 developed theoretically by Bauer and coworkers. While coherent magnons are observed in a broad range of experiments, coherent ferrons have eluded experimental detection. This discrepancy is particularly intriguing given that electric dipole interactions (FE) are inherently stronger than their magnetic counterparts. Here, we report the generation and transport of coherent ferrons in the van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric material NbOI2. By launching collective oscillations of the ferroelectric dipoles using a short laser pulse, we identify coherent ferrons from intense and narrow-band terahertz (THz) emission and observe their propagations along the polar direction at extremely hypersonic velocities exceeding 10^5 m/s. The THz emission is a second-order nonlinear process that requires ferroelectric order, as is confirmed in the structurally related ferroelectric WO2Br2 and non-ferroelectric TaOBr2. The discovery of coherent ferrons paves the way for numerous applications, including narrow-band THz emission, ferronic information processing, and quantum interconnects.

Title: On the performance of machine-learning assisted Monte Carlo in sampling from simple statistical physics models
Authors: Luca Maria Del Bono, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi, Francesco Zamponi
Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.

Title: Lattice Compatibility and Energy Barriers in Intercalation Compounds
Authors: Delin Zhang, Ananya Renuka Balakrishna
Abstract: We present a continuum model for symmetry-breaking phase transformations in intercalation compounds, based on Ericksen's multi-well energy formulation. The model predicts the nucleation and growth of crystallographic microstructures in Li$_{2}$Mn$_{2}$O$_{4}$ -- a representative intercalation compound -- with twin boundary orientations and volume fractions that closely match experimental observations. Our chemo-mechanically coupled model not only generates geometrically accurate microstructures through energy minimization, but also reveals a subtle interplay between twinned domains and electro-chemo-mechanical behavior. A key finding is that intercalation compounds satisfying specific compatibility conditions (e.g., $\lambda_{2} = 1$ or $|\det \mathbf{U} - 1| = 0)$ show lower elastic energy barriers, require smaller driving forces, and display narrower voltage hysteresis loops. Furthermore, we show that twinned domains act as conduits for fast Li-diffusion. These results establish quantitative design guidelines for intercalation compounds, which focuses on tailoring lattice deformations (rather than suppressing them) and reducing energy barriers to mitigate structural degradation and enhance the electrochemical performance of battery electrodes.

Title: Phase-space approach to cavity field dynamics in a squeezed thermal reservoir
Authors: E.P. Mattos, A. Vidiella-Barranco
Abstract: Quantum systems, such as a single-mode cavity field coupled to a thermal bath, typically experience destructive effects due to interactions with their noisy environment. When the bath combines both thermal fluctuations and a nonclassical feature like quadrature squeezing, forming a squeezed thermal reservoir, the system's behaviour can change substantially. In this work, we study the evolution of the cavity field in this generalized environment using an alternative phase-space approach based on the Glauber-Sudarshan $P$-function. We derive a compact analytical expression for the time-dependent $P$-function for arbitrary initial cavity field states and demonstrate its utility through specific examples. Additionally, we obtain analytical expressions, as a function of time, for some statistical properties of the cavity field, as well as for the nonclassical depth, $\tau_m$, a nonclassicality measure calculated directly from the $P$-function.

Title: Measurement-Induced Dynamical Quantum Thermalization
Authors: Marvin Lenk, Sayak Biswas, Anna Posazhennikova, Johann Kroha
Abstract: One of the fundamental problems of quantum statistical physics is, how an ideally isolated quantum system can ever reach thermal equilibrium behavior despite the unitary time evolution of quantum-mechanical systems. Here we study by explicit time evolution for the generic model system of an interacting, trapped Bose gas with discrete single-particle levels, how the measurement of one or more observables subdivides the system into observed and non-observed Hilbert subspaces and the tracing over the non-measured quantum numbers defines an effective, thermodynamic bath, induces entanglement of the observed Hilbert subspace with the bath, and leads to bi-exponential approach of the entanglement entropy and of the measured observables to thermal equilibrium behavior as a function of time. We find this to be more generally fulfilled than in the scenario of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), namely for both local particle occupation numbers and non-local density correlation functions, and independent of the specific initial quantum state of the time evolution.

Title: Hierarchic superradiant phases in anisotropic Dicke model
Authors: D. K. He, Z. Song
Abstract: We revisit the phase diagram of an anisotropic Dicke model by revealing the non-analyticity induced by underlying exceptional points (EPs). We find that the conventional superradiant phase can be further separated into three regions, in which the systems are characterized by different effective Hamiltonians, including the harmonic oscillator, the inverted harmonic oscillator, and their respective counterparts. We employ the Loschmidt echo to characterize different quantum phases by analyzing the quench dynamics of a trivial initial state. Numerical simulations for finite systems confirm our predictions about the existence of hierarchic superradiant phases.

Title: Pauli Propagation: A Computational Framework for Simulating Quantum Systems
Authors: Manuel S. Rudolph, Tyson Jones, Yanting Teng, Armando Angrisani, Zoë Holmes
Abstract: Classical methods to simulate quantum systems are not only a key element of the physicist's toolkit for studying many-body models but are also increasingly important for verifying and challenging upcoming quantum computers. Pauli propagation has recently emerged as a promising new family of classical algorithms for simulating digital quantum systems. Here we provide a comprehensive account of Pauli propagation, tracing its algorithmic structure from its bit-level implementation and formulation as a tree-search problem, all the way to its high-level user applications for simulating quantum circuits and dynamics. Utilising these observations, we present this http URL, a Julia software package that can perform rapid Pauli propagation simulation straight out-of-the-box and can be used more generally as a building block for novel simulation algorithms.

Title: Disturbing news about the $d=2+ε$ expansion
Authors: Fabiana De Cesare, Slava Rychkov
Abstract: The $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) in $d=2+\epsilon$ has long been conjectured to describe the same conformal field theory (CFT) as the Wilson-Fisher (WF) $O(N)$ fixed point obtained from the $\lambda(\phi^2)^2$ model in $d=4-\epsilon$. In this work, we put this conjecture into question, building on the recent observation [Jones (2024)] that the NLSM CFT possesses a protected operator with dimension $N-1$, which is instead absent in the WF $O(N)$ CFT. For $N=3$, we investigate the possibility of lifting this operator via multiplet recombination - the only known mechanism that could resolve this mismatch. We compute the anomalous dimension of the lightest operator that could participate in recombination, and find that it remains too heavy to allow for this scenario. This suggests that the NLSM $O(3)$ fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ is not continuously connected to the WF $O(3)$ CFT, and may instead describe an alternative universality class, such as the hedgehog-suppressed critical point, corresponding to the Néel-VBS phase transition in $3$D. We also discuss how to generalize this analysis to $N>3$.

Title: Resurgence Analysis of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at large charge
Authors: Jahmall Bersini, Simeon Hellerman, Domenico Orlando, Susanne Reffert
Abstract: We study the fixed point of the three-dimensional NJL model in a double-scaling limit where both the charge $Q$ and the number of fermion flavors $N$ become large with a fixed ratio $q=Q/(2N)$. While a similar analysis has been performed for the bosonic O(N) model, fermionic models pose new challenges. In this work, we systematically explore the CFT spectrum in both the large and small $q$ limits beyond the first few orders, and perform a resurgence analysis. Through this approach, we identify the exponential corrections that relate the convergent small-$q$ expansion to the asymptotic large-$q$ behavior. Our results are suggestive of a geometric interpretation of these results in terms of the worldline of particles moving along the geodesics on the cylinder.

Title: Iterative Corpus Refinement for Materials Property Prediction Based on Scientific Texts
Authors: Lei Zhang, Markus Stricker
Abstract: The discovery and optimization of materials for specific applications is hampered by the practically infinite number of possible elemental combinations and associated properties, also known as the `combinatorial explosion'. By nature of the problem, data are scarce and all possible data sources should be used. In addition to simulations and experimental results, the latent knowledge in scientific texts is not yet used to its full potential. We present an iterative framework that refines a given scientific corpus by strategic selection of the most diverse documents, training Word2Vec models, and monitoring the convergence of composition-property correlations in embedding space. Our approach is applied to predict high-performing materials for oxygen reduction (ORR), hydrogen evolution (HER), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions for a large number of possible candidate compositions. Our method successfully predicts the highest performing compositions among a large pool of candidates, validated by experimental measurements of the electrocatalytic performance in the lab. This work demonstrates and validates the potential of iterative corpus refinement to accelerate materials discovery and optimization, offering a scalable and efficient tool for screening large compositional spaces where reliable data are scarce or non-existent.

Title: Complex and tunable heating in conformal field theories with structured drives via classical ergodicity breaking
Authors: Liang-Hong Mo, Roderich Moessner, Hongzheng Zhao
Abstract: Emission and absorption of energy are fundamental aspects of non-equilibrium dynamics. The heating induced by driving a many-body system is perhaps the most straightforward diagnostic of the process of equilibration, or the lack thereof. Gapless systems are particularly susceptible to drive-induced heating, and the capacity to control such heating is of experimental importance. Our study addresses this challenge in the framework of conformal field theory (CFT), for which we study families of structured drives up to the aperiodic Thue-Morse sequence. Concretely, we consider a class of spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians, where the operator evolution is governed by a non-linear classical dynamical system $\mathcal{K}$. The existence of invariant regions and fixed points of $\mathcal{K}$ leads to different levels of ergodicity breaking. Upon bridging the gap between this dynamical system and the driven CFT, we classify various dynamical phases of matter, including the heating and non-heating phases, as well as a prethermal phase with a controllably slow heating rate. We further generalize the discussion to $\eta-$random multipolar driving, characterized by $\eta-$th order multipolar correlation in time. A ``triply tunable'' parametric dependence of the prethermal lifetime arises as $K^{-2(\eta-\xi)}$, where $K$ quantifies the deviation from the preimages of the fixed points of $\mathcal{K}$, the multipolar order $\eta$, and the order of the preimages $\xi$. Upon sacrificing Hermiticity by considering SU(2) deformed CFTs, we find another non-heating phase with a non-zero measure, inaccessible via purely unitary CFTs. This is underpinned by an emergent compact subspace in the generic $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ group structure, which we also identify in the transfer matrix in non-Hermitian systems with binary disorder.

Title: Time-tagging data acquisition system for testing superconducting electronics based on an RFSoC and custom analog frontend
Authors: Reed A. Foster, Stephen Kandeh, Owen Medeiros, Alejandro Simon, Matteo Castellani, Karl K. Berggren
Abstract: Novel electronic devices can often be operated in a plethora of ways, which makes testing circuits comprised of them difficult. Often, no single tool can simultaneously analyze the operating margins, maximum speed, and failure modes of a circuit, particularly when the intended behavior of subcomponents of the circuit is not standardized. This work demonstrates a cost-effective data acquisition system for electronic circuits that enables more intricate verification techniques than are practical with conventional experimental setups. We use high-speed digital-to-analog converters and real-time multi-gigasample-per-second waveform processing to push experimental circuits beyond their maximum operating speed. Our custom time-tagging data capture firmware reduces memory requirements and can be used to determine when errors occur. The firmware is combined with a thermal-noise-limited analog frontend with over $50\,\mathrm{dB}$ of dynamic range. Compared to currently available commercial test equipment, this data acquisition system was able to operate a superconducting shift register at a nearly three-times-higher clock frequency ($200\,\mathrm{MHz}$ vs. $80\,\mathrm{MHz}$) at roughly one seventh the cost.

Title: Memorization to Generalization: Emergence of Diffusion Models from Associative Memory
Authors: Bao Pham, Gabriel Raya, Matteo Negri, Mohammed J. Zaki, Luca Ambrogioni, Dmitry Krotov
Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples. Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used diffusion models.

Title: Global-Local Duality of Energetic Control Cost in Multipartite Quantum Correlated Systems
Authors: Rui Guan, Junjie Liu, Jian-Hua Jiang
Abstract: Multipartite quantum correlated systems (MQCSs) are widely utilized in diverse quantum information tasks, where their sophisticated control inherently incurs energetic costs. However, the fundamental characteristics of these control costs remain elusive, largely due to the lack of thermodynamic descriptions capable of capturing the full complexities of MQCSs. Here, we uncover universal thermodynamic relations for arbitrary MQCSs weakly coupled to a thermal bath, establishing an intrinsic global-local duality of control costs. Using these relations, we elucidate the exact role of multipartite correlation--a defining quantum feature of MQCSs--in shaping control costs at finite times. We also demonstrate that the relative magnitude between global and local control costs is undetermined, which perplexes the cost management of MQCSs under finite-time controls. Our results are numerically corroborated with applications to experimentally realizable multi-qubit systems undergoing finite-time qubit reset processes.

Title: Dissecting Exciton-Polariton Transport in Organic Molecular Crystals: Emerging Conductivity Assisted by Intermolecular Vibrational Coupling
Authors: Guangming Liu, Hsing-Ta Chen
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the spectral and transport properties of exciton-polaritons under the explicit influence of intermolecular vibrational coupling, which introduces dynamic disorder. In the context of a one-dimensional molecular chain strongly interacting with a cavity photon, we demonstrate the polaritonic characteristics of the spectral function and its interactions with the electronic band broadened by the coupling disorder. We further dissect the current flux into its bare excitonic contribution and transport via the cavity photon. Our results reveal that the enhancement in the charge carrier mobility and frequency-resolved conductivity stems from the photon-mediated current. More importantly, contrary to the intuition that dynamic disorder hinders transport, intermolecular vibrational coupling can facilitate exciton-polariton transport, offering an additional degree of tunability for material properties.

Title: Dual-Polarization SHG Interferometry for Imaging Antiparallel Domains and Stacking Angles of 2D Heterocrystals
Authors: Juseung Oh, Wontaek Kim, Gyouil Jeong, Yeri Lee, Jihun Kim, Hyeongjoon Kim, Hyeon Suk Shin, Sunmin Ryu
Abstract: Optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) enables orientational polarimetry for crystallographic analysis and domain imaging of various materials. However, conventional intensity polarimetry, which neglects phase information, fails to resolve antiparallel domains and to describe two-dimensional heterostructures, which represent a new class of van der Waals-bound composite crystals. In this work, we report dual-polarization spectral phase interferometry (DP-SPI) and establish a generalized SHG superposition model that incorporates the observables of DP-SPI. Antiparallel domains of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) were successfully imaged with distinction, validating the interferometric polarimetry. From DP interferograms of TMD heterobilayers, the orientation of each layer could be determined, enabling layer-resolved probing. By employing the superposition model, we also demonstrate the photonic design and fabrication of ternary TMD heterostructures for circularly polarized SHG. These methods, providing comprehensive SHG measurements and theoretical description, can be extended to heterostructures consisting of more than two constituent layers and are not limited to TMDs or 2D materials.

Title: Modified Transfer Matrix Method for the Extraction of Material Properties via Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy
Authors: Kamyar Rashidi, Matthew Y. Sfeir
Abstract: Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy is a powerful technique for extracting the low-frequency optical properties of materials. However, the optical constants are difficult to determine directly from the experimental transfer function, such that various numerical approximations must be implemented to describe specific conditions. Here, we introduce a modified Transfer Matrix Method that uses a genetic algorithm for optimization to determine the refractive index of materials in the THz regime. We show that this approach is generally applicable across a wide range of refractive indices, structures, and frequency ranges. Our method is intuitive and yields accurate results compared to leading methods across a wide spectral range (1-15 THz).

Title: Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz
Authors: H. L. Dao
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state wavefunction for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) of up to 100 spins and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems of up 50 spins. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ & $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.

Title: Physics-inspired Generative AI models via real hardware-based noisy quantum diffusion
Authors: Marco Parigi, Stefano Martina, Francesco Aldo Venturelli, Filippo Caruso
Abstract: Quantum Diffusion Models (QDMs) are an emerging paradigm in Generative AI that aims to use quantum properties to improve the performances of their classical counterparts. However, existing algorithms are not easily scalable due to the limitations of near-term quantum devices. Following our previous work on QDMs, here we propose and implement two physics-inspired protocols. In the first, we use the formalism of quantum stochastic walks, showing that a specific interplay of quantum and classical dynamics in the forward process produces statistically more robust models generating sets of MNIST images with lower Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) than using totally classical dynamics. In the second approach, we realize an algorithm to generate images by exploiting the intrinsic noise of real IBM quantum hardware with only four qubits. Our work could be a starting point to pave the way for new scenarios for large-scale algorithms in quantum Generative AI, where quantum noise is neither mitigated nor corrected, but instead exploited as a useful resource.

Title: Solvated electrons in polar liquids as epsilon-near-zero materials tunable in the terahertz frequency range
Authors: Matthias Runge, Michael Woerner, Denys I. Bondar, Thomas Elsaesser
Abstract: Electrons in polar liquids give rise to a polaron resonance at a terahertz (THz) frequency \nu_0 depending on electron concentration. The impact of this resonance on light propagation is studied in experiments, where a femtosecond pump pulse generates electrons via multiphoton ionization and a THz probe pulse propagated through the excited sample is detected in a phase-resolved way. We observe a behavior characteristic for epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials with strongly modified phase and group velocities around \nu_0, and a broadening of the THz pulse envelope below \nu_0. Calculations based on a local-field approach reproduce the ENZ behavior.

Title: Simulation of single hole spin qubit in strained triangular FinFET quantum devices
Authors: Ilan Bouquet, Jiang Cao, Mathieu Luisier
Abstract: Using an in-house Schroedinger-Poisson (SP) solver, we investigate the creation of a single hole spin qubit inside a triple-gate triangular silicon fin field effect transistor (Si FinFET) quantum device similar to experimental structures. The gate induced formation of the required quantum dot (QD) is monitored based on the Luttinger-Kohn 6x6 kp method accounting for magnetic fields and strain to determine the qubit ground state. Strain arises from the inhomogeneous contraction of the different FinFET components when they are cooled down to cryogenic temperatures. It leads to a renormalization of the qubit energy levels, thus impacting both the heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) populations as well as their mixing. The dot length, band mixing, g-factor, and Larmor/Rabi frequencies of the considered device are extracted. In particular, we show that these metrics exhibit strong strain-dependent variations of their magnitude, thus underlying the importance of including realistic thermal contraction scenarios when modeling hole spin qubits.

Title: Dynamical Sweet and Sour Regions in Bichromatically Driven Floquet Qubits
Authors: D. Dominic Briseño-Colunga, Bibek Bhandari, Debmalya Das, Long B. Nguyen, Yosep Kim, David I. Santiago, Irfan Siddiqi, Andrew N. Jordan, Justin Dressel
Abstract: Modern superconducting and semiconducting quantum hardware use external charge and microwave flux drives to both tune and operate devices. However, each external drive is susceptible to low-frequency (e.g., $1/f$) noise that can drastically reduce the decoherence lifetime of the device unless the drive is placed at specific operating points that minimize the sensitivity to fluctuations. We show that operating a qubit in a driven frame using two periodic drives of distinct commensurate frequencies can have advantages over both monochromatically driven frames and static frames with constant offset drives. Employing Floquet theory, we analyze the spectral and lifetime characteristics of a two-level system under weak and strong bichromatic drives, identifying drive-parameter regions with high coherence (sweet spots) and highlighting regions where coherence is limited by additional sensitivity to noise at the drive frequencies (sour spots). We present analytical expressions for quasienergy gaps and dephasing rates, demonstrating that bichromatic driving can alleviate the trade-off between DC and AC noise robustness observed in monochromatic drives. This approach reveals continuous manifolds of doubly dynamical sweet spots, along which drive parameters can be varied without compromising coherence. Our results motivate further study of bichromatic Floquet engineering as a powerful strategy for maintaining tunability in high-coherence quantum systems.

Title: A theory for diffusion-controlled reactions within nonequilibrium steady-states
Authors: Seokjin Moon, David T. Limmer
Abstract: We study diffusion-controlled processes in nonequilibrium steady-states, where standard rate theory assumptions break down. Using transition path theory, we generalize the relations between reactive probability fluxes and measures of the rate of the reaction. Stochastic thermodynamics analysis reveals how work constrains the enhancement of rates relative to their equilibrium values. An analytically solvable ion-pairing model under a strong electric field illustrates and validates our approach and theory. These findings provide deeper insights into diffusion-controlled reaction dynamics beyond equilibrium.

Title: A multimode cavity QED Ising spin glass
Authors: Brendan P. Marsh, David Atri Schuller, Yunpeng Ji, Henry S. Hunt, Giulia Z. Socolof, Deven P. Bowman, Jonathan Keeling, Benjamin L. Lev
Abstract: We realize a driven-dissipative Ising spin glass using cavity QED in a novel ``4/7" multimode geometry. Gases of ultracold atoms trapped within the cavity by optical tweezers serve as effective spins. They are coupled via randomly signed, all-to-all Ising cavity-mediated interactions. Networks of up to n = 25 spins are holographically imaged via cavity emission. The system is driven through a frustrated transverse-field Ising transition, and we show that the entropy of the spin glass states depends on the rate at which the transition is crossed. Despite being intrinsically nonequilibrium, the system exhibits phenomena associated with Parisi's theory of equilibrium spin glasses, namely replica symmetry breaking (RSB) and ultrametric structure. For system sizes up to n = 16, we measure the Parisi function q(x), Edwards-Anderson overlap q_EA, and ultrametricity K-correlator; all indicate a deeply ordered spin glass under RSB. The system can serve as an associative memory and enable aging and rejuvenation studies in driven-dissipative spin glasses at the microscopic level.

Title: Spin dynamics and dark particle in a weak-coupled quantum Ising ladder with $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ spectrum
Authors: Yunjing Gao, Xiao Wang, Ning Xi, Yunfeng Jiang, Rong Yu, Jianda Wu
Abstract: Emergent Ising$_h^2$ integrability is anticipated in a quantum Ising ladder composed of two weakly-coupled critical transverse field Ising chains. The system is remarkable for including eight types of massive relativistic particles, with their scattering matrix and mass spectrum characterized by the $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ Lie algebra. In this article, by computing the spin dynamical structure factors following analytical form factor approach, we clearly identify dispersive single-particle excitations of (anti-) soliton and breathers as well as their multi-particle continua in the spectra, which is further confirmed by the numerical simulations. We show that the selection rule inherent in the parity and topological charge of the theory, causes a significant result that charge-parity-odd particles, termed as dark particles, cannot be directly excited from the ground state through any local or quasi-local operations. This in turn suggests the long lifetime of the lightest dark particle.

Title: Efficient first-principles approach to Gibbs free energy with thermal expansion
Authors: Kota Hashimoto, Tomonori Tanaka, Yoshihiro Gohda
Abstract: We propose a method to evaluate the Gibbs free energy from constant-volume first-principles phonon calculations. The volume integral of the pressure is performed by determining the volume and the bulk modulus in equilibrium at finite temperatures, where the pressure and its volume derivative are evaluated utilizing first-principles calculations of the Grüneisen parameter without varying the volume. We validate our method for fcc Al by comparing with the conventional quasiharmonic approximation. Furthermore, we integrate our method with self-consistent phonon theory and apply it to calculations for bcc Ti, hcp Ti, and tetragonal ZrO$_2$. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our method by comparing results with those obtained from directly volume-varied self-consistent phonon calculations. In all cases, our method accurately evaluates the free energy change due to thermal expansion using only constant-volume phonon calculations.

Title: Geometric expansion of fluctuations and average shadows
Authors: Clément Berthiere, Benoit Estienne, Jean-Marie Stéphan, William Witczak-Krempa
Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this letter, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.

Title: Prediction of an alternative route to polymeric carbon dioxide: A metastable energetic material
Authors: Reetam Paul, Jonathan C. Crowhurst, Stanimir A. Bonev
Abstract: The use of pressure to obtain new materials that can be recovered under ambient conditions is a central problem in high-pressure physics. Despite decades of research, this goal has only been achieved in the laboratory for a few notable examples, such as diamond and cubic boron nitride. An area of significant interest is the transformation under compression of light-element molecular compounds to extended covalent-bonded (polymeric) solids. Among them, CO$_2$ has been extensively studied because of its status as a prototypical simple molecular system with a rich phase diagram and due to its fundamental role in Earth's physics and chemistry. One of its polymeric crystalline phases, accessible at extreme pressures and temperatures, has been recently quenched to ambient pressure, but below room temperature. Here we report ab initio calculations predicting that isothermal compression of a carbon monoxide and oxygen mixture (CO+O$_2$), rather than the compound CO$_2$, lowers the onset of C-polymerization at room temperature from ~118 GPa to ~7 GPa (complete by ~23 GPa). Moreover, it leads to the formation of an intrinsically different polymer with enhanced metastability. We predict that this dense phase is an energetic material which can potentially be recovered to ambient pressure and temperature.

Title: Multi higher-order Dirac and nodal line semimetals
Authors: Amartya Pal, Arnob Kumar Ghosh
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in exploring higher-order topology and their semi-metallic counterparts, particularly in the context of Dirac, Weyl, and nodal line semimetals, termed as higher-order Dirac semimetal (HODSM), higher-order Weyl semimetal, and higher-order nodal line semimetal (HONLSM). The HODSM phase exhibits hinge Fermi arcs (FAs) with a quantized higher-order topological invariant. Conversely, the HONLSM phase is a hybrid-order topological phase manifesting both drumhead-like surface states and hinge FAs as a signature of first- and second-order topology, and also possesses both first- and second-order topological invariants. In this work, we investigate a tight binding model for multi-HODSM (mHODSM) hosting multiple hinge FAs having a quantized quadrupolar winding number (QWN) greater than one. Furthermore, we obtain a multi-HONLSM (mHONLSM) phase from the mHODSM by applying an external magnetic field, which breaks the $PT$-symmetry. The mHONLSM phase possesses both the dipolar winding number, non-vanishing only inside the nodal loops, being the representative invariant for first-order topology, and the QWN, featuring both drumhead-like surface states and multiple hinge FAs. We study the spectral properties of the mHODSM and mHONLSM in different geometries. We also investigate the hinge FA-mediated transport in HONLSM employing a two-terminal setup.

Title: Universal critical phase diagram using Gini index
Authors: Soumyaditya Das, Soumyajyoti Biswas
Abstract: The critical phase surface of a system, in general, can depend on one or more parameters. We show that by calculating the Gini index ($g$) of any suitably defined response function of a system, the critical phase surface can always be reduced to that of a single parameter, starting from $g=0$ and terminating at $g=g_f$, where $g_f$ is a universal number for a chosen response function in a given universality class. We demonstrate the construction with analytical and numerical calculations of mean field transverse field Ising model and site diluted Ising model on the Bethe lattice, respectively. Both models have two parameter critical phase surfaces -- transverse field and temperature for the first case and site dilution and temperature in the second case. Both can be reduced to single parameter transition points in terms of the Gini index. We have additionally demonstrated the validity of the method for a mean field two parameter opinion dynamics model that includes a tri-critical point. The method is generally applicable for any multi-parameter critical transition.

Title: Break-down of the relationship between α-relaxation and equilibration in hydrostatically compressed metallic glasses

Abstract: Glasses encode the memory of any thermo-mechanical treatment applied to them. This ability is associated to the existence of a myriad of metastable amorphous states which can be probed through different pathways. It is usually assumed that the memory of a glass can be erased by heating the material in the supercooled liquid and that this process occurs on a time scale controlled by the {\alpha}-relaxation. We show, here, that this assumption is not fulfilled in hydrostatically compressed glasses. Applying pressure in the glass state can irreversibly modify the dynamics, thermodynamics and structure of a metallic glass-former, reducing the mobility and leading to important structural modifications resulting in a less stable state than in absence of pressure. When heated above their glass transition temperature, these compressed glasses do not convert into the pristine supercooled liquid, implying the existence of a different process, slower than the {\alpha}-relaxation controlling the equilibrium recovery.

Title: Nonreciprocal Weyl semimetal waveguide
Authors: Marco Peluso, Alessandro De Martino, Reinhold Egger, Francesco Buccheri
Abstract: We study a cylindrical plasmonic waveguide consisting of a magnetic Weyl semimetal embedded in a dielectric medium. We determine the dispersion relation of the surface plasmon polaritons and show how it depends on the plasma frequency, the radius of the semimetal and the separation between the nodes. We show that the band structure, which modifies the electrodynamics in the medium, manifests itself through a pronounced asymmetry in the dispersion curves and a giant splitting in the group velocity, with the orbital angular momentum as a control parameter for the direction of propagation.

Title: Boson-Anyon-Fermion Mapping and Anyon Construction in One Dimension
Authors: Haitian Wang, Yu Chen, Xiaoling Cui
Abstract: We establish an exact mapping between identical particles in one dimension with arbitrary exchange statistics, including bosons, anyons and fermions, provided they share the same scattering length. This boson-anyon-fermion mapping facilitates the construction of anyons from a linear superposition of spatially symmetric and anti-symmetric states. This scheme is general and has been demonstrated in a spin-1/2 Fermi gas, where both s- and p-wave bound states can be supported by manipulating spin channels. With a suitable symmetry-breaking field, these bound states are hybridized to form a fractional-wave molecule. The condensation of these molecules in a many-body system leads to anyonic superfluidity, characterized by fractional statistics upon spin exchange within a Cooper pair. These anyonic states can be detected through asymmetric momentum distributions for each spin with a chiral $k^{-3}$ tail. Our results have demonstrated the inadequacy of contact interaction model for anyons in continuum and lattices, and meanwhile proposed a convenient route for engineering fractional phases in the platform of ultracold atoms.

Title: Nanoscale and Element-Specific Lattice Temperature Measurements using Core-Loss Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy
Authors: Levi D. Palmer, Wonseok Lee, Daniel B. Durham, Javier Fajardo Jr., Yuzi Liu, A. Alec Talin, Thomas E. Gage, Scott K. Cushing
Abstract: Measuring nanoscale local temperatures, particularly in vertically integrated and multi-component systems, remains challenging. Spectroscopic techniques like X-ray absorption and core-loss electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) are sensitive to lattice temperature, but understanding thermal effects is nontrivial. This work explores the potential for nanoscale and element-specific core-loss thermometry by comparing the Si L2,3 edge's temperature-dependent redshift against plasmon energy expansion thermometry (PEET) in a scanning TEM. Using density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we ab initio model both the Si L2,3 and plasmon redshift. We find that the core-loss redshift occurs due to bandgap reduction from electron-phonon renormalization. Our results indicate that despite lower core-loss signal intensity compared to plasmon features, core-loss thermometry has key advantages and can be more accurate through standard spectral denoising. Specifically, we show that the Varshni equation easily interprets the core-loss redshift for semiconductors, which avoids plasmon spectral convolution for PEET in complex junctions and interfaces. We also find that core-loss thermometry is more accurate than PEET at modeling thermal lattice expansion in semiconductors, unless the specimen's temperature-dependent dielectric properties are fully characterized. Furthermore, core-loss thermometry has the potential to measure nanoscale heating in multi-component materials and stacked interfaces with elemental specificity at length scales smaller than the plasmon's wavefunction.

Title: Hidden quantum correlations in the ground states of quasiclassical spin systems
Authors: Levente Rózsa, Dennis Wuhrer, Sebastián A. Díaz, Ulrich Nowak, Wolfgang Belzig
Abstract: Frustrated spin models may lead to the formation of both classical non-collinear spin structures and unique quantum phases including highly entangled quantum spin liquids. Here, we study the entanglement and spatial quantum correlations in linear spin-wave theory around a classical spin-spiral ground state. We find that the entanglement between pairs of sites is short-ranged, and is completely absent in certain cases. In contrast, the entanglement hidden in multi-site clusters is peaked close to phase transitions and shows an asymptotic behavior modulated by the period of the magnetic structure. These findings motivate further exploring the connection in the entanglement properties of fully quantum and of quasiclassical spin models.

Title: Anderson localization induced by structural disorder
Authors: Sourav Bhattacharjee, Piotr Sierant, Marek Dudyński, Jan Wehr, Jakub Zakrzewski, Maciej Lewenstein
Abstract: We examine the onset of Anderson localization in three-dimensional systems with structural disorder in the form of lattice irregularities and in the absence of any on-site disordered potential. Analyzing two models with distinct types of lattice regularities, we show that the Anderson localization transition occurs when the strength of the structural disorder is smoothly increased. Performing finite-size scaling analysis of the results, we show that the transition belongs to the same universality class as regular Anderson localization induced by onsite disorder. Our work identifies a new class of structurally disordered lattice models in which destructive interference of matter waves may inhibit transport and lead to a transition between metallic and localized phases.

Title: Observation of giant nonlinear Hall conductivity in Bernal bilayer graphene
Authors: Dmitry V. Chichinadze, Naiyuan James Zhang, Jiang-Xiazi Lin, Erin Morissette, Xiaoyu Wang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Oskar Vafek, J.I.A. Li
Abstract: In a system of two-dimensional electrons, a combination of broken symmetry, interactions, and nontrivial topology can conspire to give rise to a nonlinear transport regime, where electric current density scales as the square of electric field. This regime has become a venue for exciting discoveries such as the nonlinear Hall effect and diode-like nonreciprocal transport. However, interpretation of experimental data is challenging in the nonlinear regime as DC transport is described by a rank-3 conductivity tensor with 6 free parameters. Here, we resolve this challenge by analytically solving for the nonlinear potential distribution across the disk sample for an arbitrary linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors. This allows us to unambiguously extract all components of the nonlinear tensor from experimental measurement. Using this novel tool, we identify giant nonlinear Hall effect in Bernal bilayer graphene. Our methodology provides the first systematic framework for interpreting nonlinear transport and uncovers a new route towards understanding quasi-2D materials.

Title: Generator of Neural Network Potential for Molecular Dynamics: Constructing Robust and Accurate Potentials with Active Learning for Nanosecond-scale Simulations
Authors: Naoki Matsumura, Yuta Yoshimoto, Tamio Yamazaki, Tomohito Amano, Tomoyuki Noda, Naoki Ebata, Takatoshi Kasano, Yasufumi Sakai
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing >10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial dataset creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with >10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.

Title: Self-doped Molecular Mott Insulator for Bilayer High-Temperature Superconducting La3Ni2O7
Authors: Zhan Wang, Heng-Jia Zhang, Kun Jiang, Fu-Chun Zhang
Abstract: The bilayer structure of recently discovered high-temperature superconducting nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a new platform for investigating correlation and superconductivity. Starting from a bilayer Hubbard model, we show that there is a molecular Mott insulator limit formed by the bonding band owing to Hubbard interaction $U$ and large interlayer coupling. This molecular Mott insulator becomes self-doped due to electrons transferred to the antibonding bands at a weaker interlayer coupling strength. The self-doped molecular Mott insulator is similar to the doped Mott insulator studied in cuprates. We propose La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to be a self-doped molecular Mott insulator, whose molecular Mott limit is formed by two nearly degenerate antisymmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Partial occupation of higher energy symmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital leads to self-doping, which may be responsible for high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The effects of Hund's coupling $J_H$ on the low-energy spectra are also studied via exact diagonalization. The proposed low-energy theory for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is found to be valid in a wide range of $U$ and $J_H$.

Title: Two apparently different interfacial stress formulations constructed from the diffuse interface free energy model
Authors: Takeshi Omori
Abstract: To express the capillary stress in the diffuse interface method, there are two different formulations in the literature: one formulation is proportional to the density and the other is to the density gradient. In the present study, we theoretically show that only the latter represents the capillary stress in one-component fluids and the former represents the stress related to the osmotic pressure.

Title: Extended Landauer-Büttiker Formula for Current through Open Quantum Systems with Gain or Loss
Authors: Chao Yang, Yucheng Wang
Abstract: The Landauer-Büttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.

Title: Transport signatures of inverted Andreev bands in topological Josephson junctions
Authors: Jonathan Sturm, Raffael L. Klees, Ewelina M. Hankiewicz, Daniel Gresta
Abstract: We study the thermoelectrical transport transverse to conventional and topological Josephson junctions with a central quantum dot (QD). For that purpose, we derive an effective resonant tunneling model where the QD is renormalized with an induced superconducting gap. By applying the Keldysh Green's function technique, we compute the local density of states as well as the transmission functions. In the latter case, we observe that the Andreev bound states forming on the QD are inverted if the junction has $p$-wave symmetry, meaning that electron and hole orbitals switch roles. We calculate the thermoelectric transport coefficients both analytically and numerically and show how the induced gaps and the band inversion are reflected in the electrical and heat conductance as well as the Seebeck coefficient, the latter experiencing a sign change in the topological case.

Title: Ohm's law, Joule heat, and Planckian dissipation
Authors: Hiroyasu Koizumi
Abstract: Electric current generation and its dissipation are important physical processes. It ranges from the one follows the Ohm's law to superconductivity. Recently, it has been shown that the gradient of the chemical potential force arises from the time-component of the Berry connection from many-electron wave functions, and we consider its importance for the electric current conduction in this work. We first show that it rectifies the odd explanation in Joule heating by electric current in a metallic wire: Poynting's theorem explains that the energy for the Joule heating enters from the outside of the wire as radiation. We show that this energy is supplied by the chemical potential gradient generated by the battery connection. Next, we consider the discharging of a capacitor problem where the capacitor plays a role of a battery; and the tunneling supercurrent through the Josephson junction problem, where the original derivation did not include the capacitor contribution. Lastly, we argue that the gauge fluctuation of the time-component of the Berry connection included in the chemical potential gradient force might explain the Planckian dissipation observed in high transition temperature cuprate superconductors. The present work suggests the rethinking of the gauge invariance in Maxwell's equations.

Title: Bogolon-mediated electromagnetic wave absorption in multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Xinyu Zhu, Meng Sun
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic wave absorption process in a coherently coupled two-component Bose-Einstein condensate model in different dimensionality at zero temperature. As the analogue of phonon in the solid state physics, the elementary excitation of the Bose-Einstein condensate is described by Bogoliubov quasiparticle or bogolon for short. Due to the small magnitude of the sound velocity of the bogolon, the absorption process is prohibited by the conservation of energy and momentum. To surmount this depression, the additional degree of freedom must be considered inside of the simple Bose gas model. In this article, we develop a microscopical theory for electromagnetic wave absorption by a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate and investigate the absorption rate dependence in different dimensions. Our calculation shows the possibility of manipulating the absorption property by tuning the parameters of the condensates.

Title: Direct ab initio calculation of magnons in altermagnets: method, spin-space symmetry aspects, and application to MnTe
Authors: L. M. Sandratskii, K. Carva, V. M. Silkin
Abstract: We suggest the method for direct ab initio calculation of magnons in complex collinear magnets. The method is based on the density-functional-theory calculation under two different constraints: one constraint governs the change of the magnetization with respect to the ground state, and the other is the symmetry constraint responsible for the value of the magnon wave vector. The performance of the method is demonstrated by the application to an altermagnet MnTe. An important role in both the formulation and the application of the method play the aspects of generalized symmetry described by the spin-space groups. The symmetry analysis connects in one coherent picture the following three parts of the consideration: (i) the generalized translational symmetry of the magnons as a crucial condition for their efficient ab-initio calculation, (ii) altermagnetic spin-splitting of the electron states in the ground magnetic state, and (iii) chirality splitting of the magnon excitations. It is demonstrated that both the spin splitting of the electron states and the chirality splitting of the magnons have identical patterns in the corresponding wave vector spaces. Since the altermagnetism of MnTe is the consequence of the presence of the Te atoms, an adequate attention is devoted to the symmetry analysis and calculation results for the Te moments induced in the magnon states. The knowledge of the symmetry properties of the Te moments allows to accelerate the numerical convergence of the magnon states and serves as a test for the accuracy of the calculations. To expose the connection between electron band structures of the magnon states of the system and the chirality properties of these states we investigate the transformation of the electron structure in the transition from the collinear ground state to a noncollinear magnon state.

Title: From Kernels to Features: A Multi-Scale Adaptive Theory of Feature Learning
Authors: Noa Rubin, Kirsten Fischer, Javed Lindner, David Dahmen, Inbar Seroussi, Zohar Ringel, Michael Krämer, Moritz Helias
Abstract: Feature learning in neural networks is crucial for their expressive power and inductive biases, motivating various theoretical approaches. Some approaches describe network behavior after training through a change in kernel scale from initialization, resulting in a generalization power comparable to a Gaussian process. Conversely, in other approaches training results in the adaptation of the kernel to the data, involving directional changes to the kernel. The relationship and respective strengths of these two views have so far remained unresolved. This work presents a theoretical framework of multi-scale adaptive feature learning bridging these two views. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we derive analytical expressions for network output statistics which are valid across scaling regimes and in the continuum between them. A systematic expansion of the network's probability distribution reveals that mean-field scaling requires only a saddle-point approximation, while standard scaling necessitates additional correction terms. Remarkably, we find across regimes that kernel adaptation can be reduced to an effective kernel rescaling when predicting the mean network output in the special case of a linear network. However, for linear and non-linear networks, the multi-scale adaptive approach captures directional feature learning effects, providing richer insights than what could be recovered from a rescaling of the kernel alone.

Title: Wave front propagation in the Active Coagulation Model
Authors: Matteo Paoluzzi
Abstract: Spreading processes on top of active dynamics provide a novel theoretical framework for capturing emerging collective behavior in living systems. I consider run-and-tumble dynamics coupled with coagulation/decoagulation reactions that lead to an absorbing state phase transition. While the active dynamics does not change the location of the transition point, the relaxation toward the stationary state depends on motility parameters. Because of the competition between spreading dynamics and active motion, the system can support long-living currents whose typical time scale is a nontrivial function of motility and reaction rates. Because of this interplay between time-scales, the wave front propagation qualitatively changes from traveling to diffusive waves. Moving beyond the mean-field regime, instability at finite length scales regulates a crossover from periodic to diffusive modes. Finally, it is possible to individuate different mechanisms of pattern formation on a large time scale, ranging from the Fisher-Kolmogorov to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.

Title: Photonic heat amplifiers based on a disordered semiconductor
Authors: Matteo Pioldi, Giorgio De Simoni, Alessandro Braggio, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: A photonic heat amplifier (PHA) designed for cryogenic operations is introduced and analyzed. This device comprises two variable-range-hopping reservoirs connected by lossless lines, which allow them to exchange heat through photonic modes. This configuration enables negative differential thermal conductance (NDTC), which can be harnessed to amplify thermal signals. To achieve this, one reservoir is maintained at a high temperature, serving as the source terminal of a thermal transistor. Concurrently, in the other one, we establish tunnel contacts to metallic reservoirs, which function as the gate and drain terminals. With this arrangement, it is possible to control the heat flux exchange between the source and drain by adjusting the gate temperature. We present two different parameter choices that yield different performances: the first emphasizes modulating the source-drain heat current, while the second focuses on the modulation of the colder temperature variable range hopping reservoir. Lastly, we present a potential design variation in which all electronic reservoirs are thermally connected through only photonic modes, allowing interactions between distant elements. The proposal of the PHA addresses the lack of thermal transistors and amplifiers in the mK range while being compatible with the rich toolbox of circuit quantum electrodynamics. It can be adapted to various applications, including sensing and developing thermal circuits and control devices at sub-Kelvin temperatures, which are relevant to quantum technologies.

Title: Multi-phase-field Models of Biological Tissues
Authors: Siavash Monfared, Aleksandra Ardaševa, Amin Doostmohammadi
Abstract: The development of complex multicellular organisms from a single parent cell is a highly orchestrated process that cells conduct collectively without central guidance, creating intricate dynamic patterns essential for development and regeneration. Despite significant advances in imaging spatiotemporal dynamics of cell collectives and mechanical characterization techniques, the role of physical forces in biological functions remains poorly understood. Physics-based models are crucial in complementing experiments, providing high-resolution spatiotemporal fields in three dimensions. This review focuses on dense, soft multicellular systems, such as tissues, where mechanical deformation of one cell necessitates the re-organization of neighboring cells. The multi-phase-field model offers a rich physics-based framework to advance our understanding of biological systems and provides a robust playground for non-equilibrium physics of active matter. We discuss the foundational aspects of the multi-phase-field model and their applications in understanding physics of active matter. We also explore the integration of biological physics with experimental data, covering cell migration, heterogeneous cell populations, and confined systems. Finally, we highlight current trends, the importance of multi-phase-field models in biological and physics research, and future challenges.

Abstract: Over the past century, continuous advancements in electron microscopy have enabled the synthesis, control, and characterization of high-quality free-electron beams. These probes carry an evanescent electromagnetic field that can drive localized excitations and provide high-resolution information on material structures and their optical responses, currently reaching the sub-ångström and few-meV regime. Moreover, combining free electrons with pulsed light sources in ultrafast electron microscopy adds temporal resolution in the sub-femtosecond range while offering enhanced control of the electron wave function. Beyond their exceptional capabilities for time-resolved spectromicroscopy, free electrons are emerging as powerful tools in quantum nanophotonics, on par with photons in their ability to carry and transfer quantum information, create entanglement within and with a specimen, and reveal previously inaccessible details on nanoscale quantum phenomena. This Roadmap outlines the current state of this rapidly evolving field, highlights key challenges and opportunities, and discusses future directions through a collection of topical sections prepared by leading experts.

Title: Hydrogel-to-Aerogel Transitions in Polymer-Particle Hydrogels Expand the Wildfire Defense Window
Authors: Changxin Dong, Samya Sen, Zhennan Ru, Athena Kolli, Paxton S. Appel, Jonathan Fan, Eric A. Appel
Abstract: The 2025 Los Angeles wildfires caused widespread urban destruction and displacement, and severe economic losses, highlighting the urgent need for better fire retardants. Current fire suppression strategies rely heavily on water, chemical fire retardants, and water-enhancing gels, which use superabsorbent polymers to retain water and adhere to substrates, offering extended fire protection compared to water alone. However, their effectiveness is limited by evaporation and degradation under extreme heat and wind conditions. This study investigates the thermal properties, evaporation dynamics, and fire retardancy mechanisms of a novel polymer-particle (PP) hydrogel with aerogel-forming capabilities. The boiling-induced water vapor expansion and bubble nucleation drive the transformation of the hydrogel into a highly porous, foam-like fire-retardant coating upon rapid heat desiccation, enhancing thermal insulation. By evaluating the retardancy window across different evaporation stages under high heat and wind conditions, this study aims to determine the duration, effectiveness, and governing physical mechanisms of this unique retardant system. These findings provide a framework for designing the next generation of fire retardants with optimized thermal stability and extended protection for wildfire mitigation.

Title: Machine-Learning Potentials Predict Orientation- and Mode-Dependent Fracture in Refractory Diborides
Authors: Shuyao Lin, Zhuo Chen, Rebecca Janknecht, Zaoli Zhang, Lars Hultman, Paul H. Mayrhofer, Nikola Koutna, Davide G. Sangiovanni
Abstract: Fracture toughness ($K_\mathrm{Ic}$) and fracture strength ($\sigma_\mathrm{f}$) are key criteria in the selection and design of reliable ceramics. However, their experimental characterization remains challenging -- especially for ceramic thin films, where size and interfacial effects hinder accurate and reproducible measurements. Here, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained on \textit{ab initio} datasets of single crystal models deformed up to fracture are used to characterize transgranular cleavage in pre-cracked ceramic diboride TMB$_2$ (TM = Ti, Zr, Hf) lattices through stress intensity factor ($K$)-controlled loading. Mode-I simulations performed across distinct crack geometries show that fracture is primarily driven by straight crack extension along the original plane. The corresponding macroscale fracture-initiation properties ($K_\mathrm{Ic} \approx 1.7$-2.9 MPa$\cdot\sqrt{\text{m}}$, $\sigma_\mathrm{f} \approx 1.6$-2.4 GPa) are extrapolated using established scaling laws. Considering TiB$_2$ as a representative system, additional simulations explore loading conditions ranging from pure Mode-I (opening) to Mode-II (sliding). TiB$_2$ models containing prismatic cracks exhibit their lowest fracture resistance under mixed-mode conditions, where the crack deflects onto pyramidal planes--as confirmed by nanoindentation tests on TiB$_2$(0001) thin films. This study establishes $K$-controlled, MLIP-based simulations as predictive tools for orientation- and mode-dependent fracture in ceramics. The approach is readily extendable to finite temperatures for evaluating fracture behavior under conditions relevant to refractory applications.

Title: Adhesion differentials control the rheology of biomimetic emulsions
Authors: Quentin Guigue, Marc Besse, Raphael Voituriez, Alexis M. Prevost, Elie Wandersman, Matthias Merkel, Lea-Laetitia Pontani
Abstract: Animal morphogenesis involves complex tissue deformation processes, which require tight control over tissue rheology. Yet, it remains insufficiently understood how tissue rheology results from the interplay between cellular packing and cellular forces, such as cortical tension, cell pressure, and cell-cell adhesion. Here, we follow a biomimetic approach to study this interplay, focusing on the cellular adhesion hierarchy. We mimic adhesive cells with oil droplets whose adhesion strength and specificity can be flexibly tuned. Using microfluidics, we expose 2D emulsions to an oscillatory shear, and we develop a geometric method to quantify their rheology using only imaging data. We find that emulsions made of two droplet types with a high adhesion differential progressively change their yielding behavior across subsequent shear cycles. Combining this with vertex model simulations, we show that the observed drift in yielding behavior is due to a progressive compaction, which only occurs in emulsions with a high adhesion differential and only when exposed to oscillatory shear. Gradients of cell compaction have been observed during animal development. Our work demonstrates how such gradients can be used to control gradients of tissue rheological properties. Moreover, the progressive compaction suggests the emergence of a pumping mechanism, which potentially acts in many cellular materials, from tissues to foams.

Title: Data-Driven Molecular Dynamics and TEM Analysis of Crystal Growth and Hydrogen Sensing in Pt-Functionalized Graphene Chemiresistive Sensors
Authors: Akram Ibrahim, Ahmed M. Hafez, Mahmooda Sultana, Can Ataca
Abstract: Graphene functionalized with catalytic transition metals offers high-performance gas sensing by coupling graphene's exceptional electronic transport properties with the metal's catalytic activity, yet the atomistic relationships connecting synthesis parameters, morphological outcomes, and sensor performance remain elusive. We developed an equivariant machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) with near-DFT accuracy to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Pt crystal growth on graphene and subsequent H$_2$-sensing. MD simulations validated by TEM show that Pt deposition begins with dispersed nuclei coalescing into polycrystalline nanoclusters with predominantly FCC interiors, while both MD and Raman spectroscopy reveal a predominantly non-covalent Pt-graphene interaction that induces moderate local strain and charge transfer yet preserves graphene's structural integrity. Reactive MD simulations confirm H$_2$ dissociative chemisorption exclusively on Pt, with negligible spillover onto pristine graphene. However, H adsorption on Pt attenuates the Pt-graphene interfacial binding, providing an indirect electronic pathway for H$_2$ sensing. Transient and steady-state kinetic analyses demonstrate that an intermediate Pt loading minimizes the limit of detection; lower loadings facilitate faster response and recovery kinetics and enhance signal transduction, whereas higher loadings increase the doping level of graphene. DFT charge analysis indicates that under-coordinated Pt clusters induce $n$-type doping in graphene, whereas continuous Pt films induce $p$-type doping, with both effects attenuated upon H adsorption. The developed machine-learned MD framework enables quantum-mechanically accurate modeling of metal crystal growth on graphene, elucidates the underlying H$_2$-sensing mechanism, and correlates several key sensing figures of merit with metal loading and morphology.

Title: Molecular Cross-linking of MXenes: Tunable Interfaces and Chemiresistive Sensing
Authors: Yudhajit Bhattacharjee, Lukas Mielke, Mahmoud Al-Hussein, Shivam Singh, Karen Schaefer, Qiong Li, Anik Kumar Ghosh, Carmen Herrmann, Yana Vaynzof, Andreas Fery, Hendrik Schlicke
Abstract: MXenes, a family of 2D transition metal compounds, have emerged as promising materials due to their unique electronic properties and tunable surface chemistry. However, the translation of these nanoscale properties into macroscopic devices is constrained by suitable cross-linking strategies that enable both processability and controlled inter flake charge transport. Herein, we demonstrate the tunability of interfaces and the inter-layer spacing between Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene flakes through molecular cross-linking with homologous diamines. Oleylamine was first used to stabilize Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene in chloroform, followed by diamine-mediated cross-linking to precisely tune interlayer spacing. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXRD/GIWAXS) confirmed the correlation between ligand chain length and inter-layer spacing, which was further supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, we investigated the charge transport properties of thin films consisting of these diamine-crosslinked Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXenes and observed a strong dependence of the conductivity on the interlayer spacing. Finally, we probed chemiresistive vapor sensing properties of the MXene composites and observed a pronounced sensitivity and selectivity towards water vapor, highlighting their potential for use in humidity sensors. Insights into the molecular cross-linking of MXenes to form a hybrid inorganic/organic system and its implications for charge transport, this study opens avenues for developing next-generation MXene-based electronic devices.

Title: Fabrication and characterization of boron-terminated tetravacancies in monolayer hBN using STEM, EELS and electron ptychography
Authors: Dana O. Byrne, Stephanie M. Ribet, Demie Kepaptsoglou, Quentin M. Ramasse, Colin Ophus, Frances I. Allen
Abstract: Tetravacancies in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with consistent edge termination (boron or nitrogen) form triangular nanopores with electrostatic potentials that can be leveraged for applications such as selective ion transport and neuromorphic computing. In order to quantitatively predict the properties of these structures, an atomic-level understanding of their local electronic and chemical environments is required. Moreover, robust methods for their precision manufacture are needed. Here were use electron irradiation in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) at high dose rate to drive the formation of boron-terminated tetravacancies in monolayer hBN. Characterization of the defects is achieved using aberration-corrected STEM, monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), and electron ptychography. Z-contrast in STEM and chemical fingerprinting by core-loss EELS enable identification of the edge terminations, while electron ptychography gives insight into structural relaxation of the tetravacancies and provides evidence of enhanced electron density around the defect perimeters indicative of bonding effects.

Title: The Role of Flexoelectric Coupling and Chemical Strains in the Emergence of Polar Chiral Nano-Structures
Authors: Anna N. Morozovska, Salia Cherifi-Hertel, Eugene A. Eliseev, Victoria V. Khist, Riccardo Hertel, Dean R. Evans
Abstract: This review examines the conditions that lead to the formation of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in thin films and core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. It also analyzes possible mechanisms by which the flexoelectric effect impacts the polarization structure in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. Special attention is given to the role of the anisotropic flexoelectric effect in forming a unique type of polarization states with distinct chiral properties, referred to as "flexons". In the first part of the review, we study the influence of the flexoelectric coupling on the polarity, chirality and branching of metastable labyrinthine domain structures in uniaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. We reveal that the transition from sinuous branched domain stripes to spiral-like domains occurs gradually as the flexoelectric coupling strength is increased. Our findings indicate that the joint action of flexoelectric effect and chemical strains, termed as "flexo-chemical" coupling, can significantly influence the effective Curie temperature, polarization distribution, domain morphology, and chirality in multiaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of flexo-chemical coupling and screening effects leads to the appearance and stabilization of a chiral polarization morphology in nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectrics. In the second part of the review, we discuss several advanced applications of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles for nanoelectronics elements and cryptography. We underline the possibilities of the flexoelectric control of multiple-degenerated labyrinthine states, which may correspond to a differential negative capacitance (NC) state stabilized in the uniaxial ferroelectric core by the presence of a screening shell.

Title: Physical ageing from generalised time-translation-invariance
Authors: Malte Henkel
Abstract: A generalised form of time-translation-invariance permits to re-derive the known generic phenomenology of ageing, which arises in classical many-body systems after a quench from an initially disordered system to a temperature $T\leq T_c$, at or below the critical temperature $T_c$. Generalised time-translation-invariance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of representation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries of scale-invariance and time-translation-invariance. Observable consequences include the algebraic form of the scaling functions for large arguments of the two-time auto-correlators and auto-responses, the equality of the auto-correlation and the auto-response exponents $\lambda_C=\lambda_R$, the cross-over scaling form for an initially magnetised critical system and the explanation of a novel finite-size scaling if the auto-correlator or auto-response converge for large arguments $y=t/s\gg 1$ to a plateau. For global two-time correlators, the time-dependence involving the initial critical slip exponent $\Theta$ is confirmed and is generalised to all temperatures below criticality and to the global two-time response function, and their finite-size scaling is derived as well. This also includes the time-dependence of the squared global order-parameter. The celebrate Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation with the auto-correlation exponent is thereby extended to all temperatures below the critical temperature. A simple criterion on the relevance of non-linear terms in the stochastic equation of motion is derived, taking the dimensionality of couplings into account. Its applicability in a wide class of models is confirmed, for temperatures $T\leq T_c$. Relevance to experiments is also discussed.

Title: A local quantized marker for topological magnons from circular dichroism
Authors: Baptiste Bermond, Anaïs Defossez, Nathan Goldman
Abstract: The low-energy excitations of a spin system can display Bloch bands with non-trivial topological properties. While topological magnons can be identified through the detection of chiral propagating modes at the sample's edge, an intriguing approach would be to directly probe their topological nature via localized measurements deep within the bulk. In this work, we introduce a quantized topological marker suitable for topological spin systems, which can be experimentally accessed by combining a local driven-dissipative preparation scheme with a circular-dichroic measurement. Demonstrated on a 2D ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin system incorporating Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, this method effectively maps a local Chern marker with single-site resolution while inherently accounting for magnon losses. Our work offers a general strategy to access local topological markers in bosonic settings within a driven-dissipative framework.

Title: Quantum confinement theory of ultra-thin films: electronic, thermal and superconducting properties
Authors: Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of ultra-thin films with a thickness ranging from a few tens of nanometers to just about 1-2 nanometers. While these materials are still effectively 3D in many respects, traditional theories as well as ab initio methods struggle to describe their properties as measured in experiments. In particular, standard approaches to quantum confinement rely on hard-wall boundary conditions, which neglect the unavoidable, ubiquitous, atomic-scale irregularities of the interface. Recently, a unified theoretical approach to quantum confinement has been proposed which is able to effectively take the real nature of the interface into account, and can efficiently be implemented in synergy with microscopic theories. Its predictions for the electronic properties such as electrical conductivity of semiconductor thin films or critical temperature of superconducting thin films, have been successfully verified in comparison with experimental data. The same confinement principles lead to new laws for the phonon density of states and for the heat capacity of thin films, again in agreement with the available experimental data.

Title: Quantifying dissipation in flocking dynamics: When tracking internal states matters
Authors: Karel Proesmans, Gianmaria Falasco, Atul Tanaji Mohite, Massimiliano Esposito, Étienne Fodor
Abstract: Aligning self-propelled particles undergo a nonequilibrium flocking transition from apolar to polar phases as their interactions become stronger. We propose a thermodynamically consistent lattice model, in which the internal state of the particles biases their diffusion, to capture such a transition. Changes of internal states and jumps between lattice sites obey local detailed balance with respect to the same interaction energy. We unveil a crossover between two regimes: for weak interactions, the dissipation is maximal, and partial inference (namely, based on discarding the dynamics of internal states) leads to a severe underestimation; for strong interactions, the dissipation is reduced, and partial inference captures most of the dissipation. Finally, we reveal that the macroscopic dissipation, evaluated at the hydrodynamic level, coincides with the microscopic dissipation upon coarse-graining. We argue that this correspondence stems from a generic mapping of active lattice models with local detailed balance into a specific class of non-ideal reaction-diffusion systems.

Title: Bootstrapping Nonequilibrium Stochastic Processes
Authors: Minjae Cho
Abstract: We show that bootstrap methods based on the positivity of probability measures provide a systematic framework for studying both synchronous and asynchronous nonequilibrium stochastic processes on infinite lattices. First, we formulate linear programming problems that use positivity and invariance property of invariant measures to derive rigorous bounds on their expectation values. Second, for time evolution in asynchronous processes, we exploit the master equation along with positivity and initial conditions to construct linear and semidefinite programming problems that yield bounds on expectation values at both short and late times. We illustrate both approaches using two canonical examples: the contact process in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, and the Domany-Kinzel model in both synchronous and asynchronous forms in 1+1 dimensions. Our bounds on invariant measures yield rigorous lower bounds on critical rates, while those on time evolutions provide two-sided bounds on the half-life of the infection density and the temporal correlation length in the subcritical phase.

Title: An Efficient Algorithmic Way to Construct Boltzmann Machine Representations for Arbitrary Stabilizer Code
Authors: Yuan-Hang Zhang, Zhian Jia, Yu-Chun Wu, Guang-Can Guo
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) have demonstrated considerable success as variational quantum states; however, their representational power remains incompletely understood. In this work, we present an analytical proof that RBMs can exactly and efficiently represent stabilizer code states (a class of highly entangled quantum states that are central to quantum error correction). Given a set of stabilizer generators, we develop an efficient algorithm to determine both the RBM architecture and the exact values of its parameters. Our findings provide new insights into the expressive power of RBMs, highlighting their capability to encode highly entangled states, and may serve as a useful tool for the classical simulation of quantum error-correcting codes.

Title: Low-temperature spectrum of the quantum transfer matrix of the XXZ chain in the massless regime
Authors: Saskia Faulmann, Frank Göhmann, Karol K. Kozlowski
Abstract: The free energy per lattice site of a quantum spin chain in the thermodynamic limit is determined by a single `dominant' Eigenvalue of an associated quantum transfer matrix in the infinite Trotter number limit. For integrable quantum spin chains, related with solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, an appropriate choice of the quantum transfer matrix enables to study its spectrum, e.g.\ by means of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz. In its turn, the knowledge of the full spectrum allows one to study its universality properties such as the appearance of a conformal spectrum in the low-temperature regime. More generally, accessing the full spectrum is a necessary step for deriving thermal form factor series representations of the correlation functions of local operators for the spin chain under consideration. These are statements that have been established by physicists on a heuristic level and that are calling for a rigorous mathematical justification. In this work we implement certain aspects of this programme with the example of the XXZ quantum spin chain in the antiferromagnetic massless regime and in the low-temperature limit. We rigorously establish the existence, uniqueness and characterise the form of the solutions to the non-linear integral equations that are equivalent to the Bethe Ansatz equations for the quantum transfer matrix of this model. This allows us to describe that part of the quantum transfer matrix spectrum that is related to the Bethe Ansatz and that does not collapse to zero in the infinite Trotter number limit. Within the considered part of the spectrum we rigorously identify the dominant Eigenvalue and show that those correlations lengths that diverge in the low-temperature limit are given, to the leading order, by the spectrum of the free Boson $c=1$ conformal field theory. This rigorously establishes a long-standing conjecture present in the physics literature.

Title: Symmetry's Edge in Cortical Dynamics: Multiscale Dynamics of Ensemble Excitation and Inhibition
Authors: Nima Dehghani
Abstract: Creating a quantitative theory for the cortex presents challenges and raises questions. What are the significant scales--micro, meso, or macroscopic? What are the interactions--pairwise, higher order, or mean-field? And what control parameters are relevant--noisy, dissipative, or emergent? We suggest an approach inspired by advances in understanding matter. This involves identifying invariances in neuron ensemble dynamics, searching for order parameters connecting key degrees of freedom and distinguishing macroscopic states, and pinpointing broken symmetries to uncover emergent laws when neurons interact and coordinate. Using multielectrode and multiscale neural recordings, we measure population-level ensemble Excitation/Inhibition (E/I) balance, differing from the input-level E/I balance of single neurons, to study collective behavior in large neural populations. We investigate a set of parameters that can assist us in differentiating between various functional system states (during wake/sleep cycle) and pinpointing broken symmetries that serve different information processing and memory functions. Furthermore, we identify pathological broken symmetries that result in states like seizures.

Title: On the choice of non-linear terms in blocking cat states by energy conservation
Authors: Leonardo De Carlo
Abstract: In [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] I considered the problem of wavefunction ensembles for spin models. To observe magnetization at finite temperature, I had to add macroscopic nonlinear terms blocking macroscopic superpositions by energy conservation. The nonlinear terms were of the kind introduced in [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] to block spatial cats by energy conservation as solution to the Measurement Problem. Reviewing the theory from [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:1908.02352 (2019)], I derive a commutation relation that these nonlinear terms have to satisfy to be admitted and show that the terms of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:2008.08663 (2020)] restricting the wavefunctions in space satisfies such relations. I generalize the terms of [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] for non-pure spin models and check if they also satisfy the constraints, concluding with a negative answer. An experimental estimate to test the proposal of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] is described at the end.

Title: Universal Approximation of Mean-Field Models via Transformers
Authors: Shiba Biswal, Karthik Elamvazhuthi, Rishi Sonthalia
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of transformers to approximate the mean-field dynamics of interacting particle systems exhibiting collective behavior. Such systems are fundamental in modeling phenomena across physics, biology, and engineering, including opinion formation, biological networks, and swarm robotics. The key characteristic of these systems is that the particles are indistinguishable, leading to permutation-equivariant dynamics. First, we empirically demonstrate that transformers are well-suited for approximating a variety of mean field models, including the Cucker-Smale model for flocking and milling, and the mean-field system for training two-layer neural networks. We validate our numerical experiments via mathematical theory. Specifically, we prove that if a finite-dimensional transformer effectively approximates the finite-dimensional vector field governing the particle system, then the $L_2$ distance between the \textit{expected transformer} and the infinite-dimensional mean-field vector field can be uniformly bounded by a function of the number of particles observed during training. Leveraging this result, we establish theoretical bounds on the distance between the true mean-field dynamics and those obtained using the transformer.

Title: ReGNet: Reciprocal Space-Aware Long-Range Modeling for Crystalline Property Prediction
Authors: Jianan Nie, Peiyao Xiao, Kaiyi Ji, Peng Gao
Abstract: Predicting properties of crystals from their structures is a fundamental yet challenging task in materials science. Unlike molecules, crystal structures exhibit infinite periodic arrangements of atoms, requiring methods capable of capturing both local and global information effectively. However, most current works fall short of capturing long-range interactions within periodic structures. To address this limitation, we leverage \emph{reciprocal space} to efficiently encode long-range interactions with learnable filters within Fourier transforms. We introduce Reciprocal Geometry Network (ReGNet), a novel architecture that integrates geometric GNNs and reciprocal blocks to model short-range and long-range interactions, respectively. Experimental results on JARVIS, Materials Project, and MatBench demonstrate that ReGNet achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across a range of crystal property prediction tasks. Additionally, we explore a model extension that employs the mixture-of-experts for multi-property prediction with promising results and high computational efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of our model as a scalable and accurate solution for crystal property prediction. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Title: Quantifying interdisciplinary synergy in higher STEM education
Authors: Gahyoun Gim, Jinhyuk Yun, Sang Hoon Lee
Abstract: We propose a framework to quantify and utilize interdisciplinarity in science and engineering curricula in the case of university-level higher education. We analyze interdisciplinary relations by standardizing large-scale official educational data in Korea using a cutting-edge large language model and constructing knowledge maps for disciplines of scientific education. We design and evaluate single-field and integrated dual-field curricula by adapting pedagogical theory and utilizing information theory-based metrics. We develop standard curricula for individual disciplines and integrated curricula combining two fields, with their interdisciplinarity quantified by the curriculum synergy score. The results indicate higher interdisciplinarity for combinations within or across closely related fields, especially in engineering fields. Based on the analysis, engineering fields constitute the core structure of our design for curriculum interdisciplinarity, while basic natural science fields are located at peripheral stems to provide fundamental concepts.

Title: Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures
Authors: D. Bafia, B. Abdisatarov, R. Pilipenko, Y. Lu, G. Eremeev, A. Romanenko, A. Grassellino
Abstract: Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium introduce microwave losses that degrade the performance of superconducting resonators. While such losses have been extensively studied above 1~K, we report here their direct quantification in the millikelvin and low-photon regime relevant to quantum devices. Using a high-quality factor 3-D niobium cavity cooled through its superconducting transition in controlled magnetic fields, we isolate flux-induced losses and extract a sensitivity to trapped flux of approximately 2~n$\Omega$/mG at 10~mK and 6~GHz. The decay rate is initially dominated by two-level system (TLS) losses from the native niobium pentoxide, with vortex-induced degradation of $T_1$ occurring above $B_{\text{trap}}\sim$~50~mG. In the absence of the oxide, even 10~mG of trapped flux limits performance $Q_0\sim$~10$^{10}$, or $T_1\sim$~350~ms, underscoring the need for stringent magnetic shielding. The sensitivity decreases with temperature and remains largely field-independent, whereas the flux-induced frequency shift exhibits a minimum near 0.8~K. These behaviors are well modeled assuming the thermal activation of pinning centers within the Gittleman-Rosenblum framework. Our results suggest that niobium-based transmon qubits can tolerate vortex-induced dissipation at trapped field levels up to several hundred mG, but achieving long coherence times still requires careful magnetic shielding to suppress lower-field losses from other mechanisms.

Title: Tailoring nuclear spins order with defects: a Quantum Technology CAD study
Authors: Gaetano Calogero, Ioannis Deretzis, Giuseppe Fisicaro, Damiano Ricciarelli, Rosario Gaetano Viglione, Antonino La Magna
Abstract: The full design of relevant systems for quantum applications, ranging from quantum simulation to sensing, is presented using a combination of atomistic methods. A prototypical system features a two-dimensional ordered distribution of spins interacting with out-of-plane spin drivers/probes. It could be realized in wide-bandgap semiconductors through open-volume point defects and functionalized surfaces with low Miller indexes. We study the case of defect electron spins (driver / probe) interacting via hyperfine coupling with $S=1/2$ nuclear spins of H atoms chemisorbed onto \hkl(001) and \hkl(111) 3C-SiC surfaces. We simulate the system fabrication processes with super lattice kinetic Monte Carlo, demonstrating that epitaxial growth under time-dependent conditions is a viable method for achieving controlled abundance or depletion of near-surface point defects. Quantum features are evaluated by means of extensive numerical analysis at a full quantum mechanical level based on calibrated models of interacting spin systems. This analysis includes both stationary (relative stability of ordered states) and time-dependent (protocols) conditions, achieved varying the model parameters (in our case the atomic structure and the external field). We identify a rich scenario of metastable spin-waves in the quantum simulation setting. The interaction between protocols and variable system configurations could hinder the effectiveness of the preparation/measurement phases.

Title: Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations without quantum corrections: A coherent-incoherent correspondence approach
Authors: Tomohiro Nishiyama, Yoshihiko Hasegawa
Abstract: We introduce the coherent-incoherent correspondence as a framework for deriving quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations under continuous measurement in Lindblad dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence establishes a mapping between the original quantum system undergoing coherent evolution and its corresponding incoherent system without coherent dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence relates quantities across these two systems, including jump statistics, dynamical activity, and entropy production. Since the classical-like properties of the incoherent system allow us to derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations within it, these relations can be transferred to the coherent system via the coherent-incoherent correspondence. This enables us to derive quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations for the original coherent system. Unlike existing quantum uncertainty relations, which typically require explicit quantum correction terms, our approach avoids these additional terms. This framework provides a general method for deriving trade-offs in quantum thermodynamics.
