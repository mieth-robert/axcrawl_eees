Title: Dissecting a Small Artificial Neural Network
Authors: Xiguang Yang, Krish Arora, Michael Bachmann
Abstract: We investigate the loss landscape and backpropagation dynamics of convergence for the simplest possible artificial neural network representing the logical exclusive-OR (XOR) gate. Cross-sections of the loss landscape in the nine-dimensional parameter space are found to exhibit distinct features, which help understand why backpropagation efficiently achieves convergence toward zero loss, whereas values of weights and biases keep drifting. Differences in shapes of cross-sections obtained by nonrandomized and randomized batches are discussed. In reference to statistical physics we introduce the microcanonical entropy as a unique quantity that allows to characterize the phase behavior of the network. Learning in neural networks can thus be thought of as an annealing process that experiences the analogue of phase transitions known from thermodynamic systems. It also reveals how the loss landscape simplifies as more hidden neurons are added to the network, eliminating entropic barriers caused by finite-size effects.

Title: Phase-Locking Parametric Instability Coupling Longitudinal and Transverse Waves on Rivulets in a Hele-Shaw Cell
Authors: Grégoire Le Lay (UPCité, MSC, INP-CNRS), Adrian Daerr (MSC, UPCité, INP-CNRS)
Abstract: We report an instability exhibited by a fluid system when coupling two distinct types of waves, both linearly damped. While none of them is unstable on its own, they amplify one another, resulting in a previously unreported convective instability. An external excitation is used to induce a parametric cross-coupling between longitudinal and transverse deformations of a liquid bridge between two vertical glass plates. Coherent amplification results in waves satisfying a synchronization condition, which selects a precise wavelength. We derive a model for this instability using depth-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, showing the physical origin of the coamplification, and confirm its relevance experimentally. Our findings open new perspectives in the study of parametrically controlled pattern formation, and invites the search for analogous parametric cross-coupling instabilities in other systems exhibiting distinct wave types, from plasma to elastic media.

Title: Orientation selection in alloy dendritic evolution during melt-pool solidification
Authors: Saurabh Tiwari, Supriyo Ghosh
Abstract: Investigations of directionally solidifying melt pools during metal additive manufacturing (AM) reveal that the resulting subgrain cellular structures often grow along crystalline orientations different from the temperature gradient direction, some of which are not even along preferred crystallographic directions. It is well-known that dendrite orientation results from the growth competition between the heat flow direction and preferred crystallographic orientation. Specifically, the competition between interfacial anisotropy and process anisotropy (thermal gradient and growth velocity) during directional solidification leads to rich morphological diversity of the resulting dendritic structures, including tilted dendrites and seaweed patterns. The orientation selection mechanisms of such patterns remain unexplored at high velocity in the frame of AM. This study examines the tilted growth of cellular-dendritic arrays as a function of the misorientation angle ($\theta_R$) between the thermal gradient and crystal lattice directions and other relevant control parameters. We use a phase-field model to explore dendritic evolution in a binary alloy during high-velocity solidification in 2D. We find marked effects of thermal gradient, growth velocity, alloy composition, and anisotropy parameters on the possible growth directions and the primary arm spacing, constitutional undercooling, microsegregation, and secondary phases that arise during dendritic solidification. Our work provides a detailed yet concise presentation on the tilted growth and morphological transition for a broad range of thermal conditions in the high-velocity regime and the full range of $\theta_R$ for establishing orientation selection maps. These results should have qualitative relevance for controlling the subgrain structure, chemical segregation, and texture randomization in commercial dendrite materials relevant to AM.

Title: Ultrasound Propagation in Water-Sorbing Carbon Xerogel
Authors: Ashoka Karunarathne, Stephan Braxmeier, Boris Gurevich, Alexei F. Khalizov, Gudrun Reichenauer, Gennady Y. Gor
Abstract: Adsorption of water vapor in nanoporous carbons is rather complex due to an interplay between the pore structure and surface chemistry of these materials. Deciphering the mechanism of adsorption requires the knowledge of the spatial distribution and the filling fraction of the adsorbed water. Characteristics of ultrasonic wave propagation through a nanoporous sample provides a wealth of information such as properties of fluids confined in the pores and spatial distribution of adsorbate in the pores. Here we studied water vapor adsorption on carbon xerogel, with a bimodal pore size distribution consisting of micropores (1 nm) and mesopores (8 nm) and overall porosity 68%. The relative humidity was increased in steps and the amount of water adsorbed by the sample was measured gravimetrically at each step, producing a type V isotherm, characteristic of water adsorption to weakly interacting carbon nanopores. Concurrently, we recorded the waveforms for longitudinal and transverse ultrasonic waves that passed through the sample at each saturation step. These measurements provided the wave amplitudes and speeds as a function of relative humidity, and these data were used to calculate the elastic moduli and ultrasonic attenuation of the xerogel-water composite. Analysis of the elastic moduli evolution suggested that confined water shows nearly bulk-like properties in mesopores, while in micropores its modulus noticeably differs from that of bulk water, consistent with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the observed increase in ultrasonic attenuation during micropore filling indicated the spatial heterogeneity of the water-filled pore space within the overall sample volume. Overall, this study demonstrates the successful utilization of nondestructive ultrasonic testing to probe the fluid adsorption mechanism in a nanoporous medium and the properties of adsorbed phase.

Title: Theory of the Photomolecular Effect
Authors: Michael J. Landry, Chuliang Fu, James H. Zhang, Jiachen Li, Gang Chen, Mingda Li
Abstract: It is well-known that water in both liquid and vapor phases exhibits exceptionally weak absorption of light in the visible range. Recent experiments, however, have demonstrated that at the liquid-air interface, absorption in the visible range is drastically increased. This increased absorption results in a rate of evaporation that exceeds the theoretical thermal limit by between two and five times. Curiously, the evaporation rate peaks at green wavelengths of light, while no corresponding absorptance peak has been observed. Experiments suggest that photons can cleave off clusters of water molecules at the surface, but no clear theoretical model has yet been proposed to explain how this is possible. This paper aims to present such a model and explain this surprising and important phenomenon.

Title: Fermion liquids as quantum Hall liquids in phase space: A unified approach for anomalies and responses
Authors: Jaychandran Padayasi, Ken K. W. Ma, Kun Yang
Abstract: The discovery of many strongly correlated metallic phases have inspired novel routes to generalize or go beyond the celebrated Landau Fermi liquid theory. To this end, from universal consideration of symmetries and anomalies, Else, Thorngren and Senthil (ETS) have introduced a class of theories called ersatz Fermi liquids which possess a Fermi surface and satisfy a generalized Luttinger's theorem. In this work, we view all such fermion liquids obeying the Luttinger theorem as incompressible quantum Hall liquids in higher-dimensional phase space and use it as the starting point to derive their effective low-energy field theory. The non-commutativity of phase space motivates us to use Seiberg-Witten map to derive the field theory in an ordinary (commutative) space and naturally leads to terms that correspond to the correct topological Chern-Simons action postulated by ETS in one, two, and three dimensions. Additionally, our approach also reproduces all the non-topological terms that characterize important contributions to the response, including the semiclassical equations of motion. Finally, our derivations of Chern-Simons terms from the Seiberg-Witten map also verify a longstanding conjecture in non-commutative field theory.

Title: Superdiffusive transport in chaotic quantum systems with nodal interactions
Authors: Yu-Peng Wang, Jie Ren, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Romain Vasseur
Abstract: We introduce a class of interacting fermionic quantum models in $d$ dimensions with nodal interactions that exhibit superdiffusive transport. We establish non-perturbatively that the nodal structure of the interactions gives rise to long-lived quasiparticle excitations that result in a diverging diffusion constant, even though the system is fully chaotic. Using a Boltzmann equation approach, we find that the charge mode acquires an anomalous dispersion relation at long wavelength $\omega(q) \sim q^{z} $ with dynamical exponent $z={\rm min}[(2n+d)/2n,2]$, where $n$ is the order of the nodal point in momentum space. We verify our predictions in one dimensional systems using tensor-network techniques.

Title: Observation of Jones-Roberts solitons in a paraxial quantum fluid of ligh
Authors: Myrann Baker-Rasooli, Tangui Aladjidi, Nils A.Krause, Ashton S. Bradley, Quentin Glorieux
Abstract: We investigate the formation and dynamics of Jones-Roberts solitons in a smoothly inhomogeneous quantum fluid. To do so, we create a superfluid of light using paraxial, near-resonant laser beam propagating through a hot rubidium vapor. We excite a bounded vortex-antivortex dipole in the superfluid and observe its transition to a rarefaction pulse and back, in agreement with the seminal predictions of Jones and Roberts. Employing an analogy with ray optics, we calculate the trajectory of the interacting vortices, deriving an effective refractive index from the inhomogeneous fluid density. Finally, we examine analytically and experimentally the superfluid velocity correlations, observing a transfer of coherence from incompressible to compressible velocity of the quantum fluid, a direct signature of the dynamical conversion between vortices and rarefaction pulse.

Title: Misfit layer superconductors, tuneable bulk heterostructures with strong 2D effects
Authors: Tomas Samuely, Martin Gmitra, Tristan Cren, Mateo Calandra, Peter Samuely
Abstract: Atomically thin layered materials are systems with zero limit bulk-to-surface ratio. Their physical properties are determined by two-dimensionality and strongly affected by interfacing with other systems. Therefore, they represent an accessible platform for the abundance of quantum effects that can be engineered by combining them into vertical stacks. Two types of layered systems are considered here - artificially prepared (exfoliated) van der Waals nanostructures, and naturally layered systems showing quasi 2D behaviour already in a bulk form. A special class of naturally layered materials is misfit structures combining atomic layers of hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides and slabs of tetragonal ionic rare-earth monochalcogenides in the same superlattice. Both types of layered systems feature a new state of quantum matter, the Ising superconductivity extremely resilient to external magnetic field. A giant electron doping, natural to the misfit structures, can lead to topological superconductivity. Both systems can also be assembled into heterostructures combining different constituents. Layered 2D heterostructures have a large number of implications for many potential applications in solid-state devices.

Title: Extremal events dictate population growth rate inference
Authors: Trevor GrandPre, Ethan Levien, Ariel Amir
Abstract: Recent methods have been developed to map single-cell lineage statistics to population growth. Because population growth selects for exponentially rare phenotypes, these methods inherently depend on sampling large deviations from finite data, which introduces systematic errors. A comprehensive understanding of these errors in the context of finite data remains elusive. To address this gap, we study the error in growth rate estimates across different models. We show that under the usual bias-variance decomposition, the bias can be decomposed into a finite-time bias and nonlinear averaging bias. We demonstrate that finite-time bias, which dominates at short times, can be mitigated by fitting its monotonic behavior. In contrast, at longer times, nonlinear averaging bias becomes the predominant source of error, leading to a phase transition. This transition can be understood through the Random Energy Model, a mean-field model of disordered systems, where a few lineages dominate the estimator. Applying these methods to experimental data demonstrates that correcting for biases in lineage-based approaches yields consistent results for the long-term growth rate across multiple methods and enables the reverse-engineering of dynamic models. This new framework provides a quantitative understanding of growth rate estimators, clarifies the conditions under which they can be effectively applied to finite data, and introduces model-free approaches for studying the connections between physiology and cell growth.

Title: Evidence of Non-Equilibrium Critical Phenomena in a Simple Model of Traffic
Authors: Aryaman Jha, Kurt Wiesenfeld, Garyoung Lee, Jorge Laval
Abstract: We present a novel approach to understand vehicular traffic jams by studying a simple model, Elementary Cellular Automaton Rule 184 (ECA 184). Using key traffic observables, such as the total delay and relaxation time, as well as microscopic measures like delays and lifetimes of individual jams, we show how these quantities can fully characterize the system's behavior, revealing features analogous to those of a continuous phase transition. We exploit specific properties of ECA 184 to develop an efficient algorithm for calculating these observables numerically and introduce an auxiliary quantity, termed ''elementary jams'', which allows us to determine these observables. We discuss the implications of our results, highlighting connections to a potential field-theoretic description of traffic and suggest future application of these methods to more complex models.

Title: SUSY design of smooth quantum rings in graphene
Authors: Francisco Correa, Luis Inzunza, Vít Jakubský
Abstract: We develop a suitable technique to design zero-energy graphene models with radial electrostatic potentials capable of achieving electrostatic confinement. Using the Gaussian law for electrostatics, we derive the charge density associated with these potentials that correspond to concentric electrostatic rings. The technique is based on a modified supersymmetric transformation that allows to design time-reversal invariant interaction terms and to find the corresponding zero-energy bound states in analytical form. Consequently, solutions with the same probability density but different angular momentum are characterized by circular probability currents flowing in opposite directions. The energies of the systems defined in two Dirac valleys (one-valley) have a fourfold (twofold) degeneracy. As an example of the technique, we construct a ring-decorated Coulomb potential that exhibits zero energy collapse and bound states together.

Title: Energy density and stress fields in quantum systems
Authors: Richard M. Martin, Nithaya Chetty, Dallas R. Trinkle
Abstract: There has been an enduring interest and controversy about whether or not one can define physically meaningful energy density and stress fields, $e({\bf r})$ and $\sigma_{\alpha \beta}({\bf r})$ in quantum systems. A key issue is kinetic energy since $\frac{1}{2}|\nabla \Psi|^2$ and $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$ lead to different densities, and analogous issues arise interaction energies. This paper presents a resolution to the problems in two steps: 1) All effects of exchange and correlation are shown to be unique functions defined at each point ${\bf r}$; all issues of non-uniqueness involve only the density $n({\bf r})$ and are equivalent to a single-particle problem with wavefunction $s({\bf r}) = \sqrt{n({\bf r})/N}$. 2) Forms for the latter terms are proposed based on the nature of energy and stress, where energy has two distinct roles. Because the energy determines the ground state itself through the variational principle, the appropriate density involves the terms in the hamiltonian: $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$ and interactions in terms of potentials acting on the particles. This leads naturally to density functional theory with the interpretation that the energy density $e({\bf r})$ is equilibrated to minimize fluctuations with the same chemical potential throughout the system. On the other hand, the energy and stress (derivative of the energy with respect to strain) are properties of the ground state, and simple examples to show that the only acceptable expressions involve the combination $\frac{1}{4}[|\nabla \Psi|^2 - \Psi\nabla^2 \Psi]$, as derived by Schrodinger, Pauli and others, and Coulomb interactions in the Maxwell form in terms of electric fields, not potentials. Together these results lead to well-defined formulations of energy density and stress fields that are physically motivated and based on a clear set of arguments.

Title: Non-equilibrium Dynamics of Fermi Polarons Driven by Time-dependent Interaction
Authors: Fan Yang, Ran Qi
Abstract: We systematically studied the dynamics of Fermi polarons driven by time-dependent scattering length using a time-dependent variational method. Starting from the non-interacting initial state, we calculated the evolution behavior of the contact, energy, and quasiparticle residue of this system as the scattering length $a_s(t)$ increases from zero. In the short-time evolution, we obtained analytical results, verifying that when $a_s(t)$ grows as $\sqrt{t}$, the contact $C(t)$ and energy $E(t)$ exhibit the maximum growth rate. Furthermore, we numerically solved the long-time evolution, when $a_s(t)$ is diven with a strength $\beta$ and a power $\alpha$ as $a_s(t) = {\sqrt{2}\beta}/{k_F} {(\epsilon_Ft)}^{\alpha}$. For large driving strength, due to the interference between the polaron states and the non-interacting states, $C(t)$ and $Z(t)$ exhibit oscillatory behavior; For small $\beta$, the oscillatory behavior disappears due to the decay of the repulsive polaron into the continuum, and $C(t)$ and $Z(t)$ gradually relax to zero. The energy always saturates over long times for different driving strength. Additionally, our method is applicable to any time-dependent form of the scattering length.

Title: Design and Benchmarks for Emulating Kondo Dynamics on a Quantum Chip
Authors: Soumyadeep Sarma, Jukka I. Väyrynen, Elio J. König
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in digital quantum simulation and the overall prospective of solving correlated many-electron problems using quantum algorithms, we design a gate-based quantum circuit that emulates the dynamics of the Kondo impurity model. We numerically determine the impurity magnetization, entanglement between impurity and fermionic sites and energy as a function of time (i.e.~circuit depth) for various initial states and find universal long-time dynamics. We complement the numerical simulations for moderate system size with an asymptotically exact analytical solution that is effective in the limit of large system sizes and for starting states corresponding to a filled Fermi sea. This work opens up the perspective of studying the dynamics of electronic quantum many-body states on quantum chips of the NISQ era.

Title: High-Magnetic Field Phases in U$_{1-x}$Th$_x$Te$_2$
Authors: Camilla M. Moir, John Singleton, Joanna Blawat, Eric Lee-Wong, Yuhang Deng, Keke Feng, Tyler Wannamaker, Ryan E. Baumbach, M. Brian Maple
Abstract: At temperatures much lower than its superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ of 2.1 K, the heavy fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ has a remarkable phase diagram of magnetic field $H$ vs. angles $\phi$ and $\theta$ at which $H$ is tilted away from the $b$-axis toward the $a$- and $c$-axes, respectively, in the orthorhombic unit cell. The phase diagram appears to contain three superconducting phases: (1) a low field superconducting phase SC$_{\mathrm{LF}}$ extending over all values of $\phi$ and $\theta$ with an upper critical field $H_{c2}$ with a maximum value of 15 T at $\phi = \theta = 0^\circ$; (2) a high field superconducting phase SC$_{\mathrm{HF}}$ located in a region between $\phi \approx 7^\circ$ and $\theta \approx 4^\circ$ in fields from $H_{c2\mathrm{LF}}$ of the SC$_{\mathrm{LF}}$ phase and the metamagnetic transition at $H_m$ at $\sim 35$ T marking the onset of the magnetic field polarized FP phase: and (3) a SC$_{\mathrm{FP}}$ superconducting phase that resides entirely within the FP phase in a pocket of superconductivity extending from $\theta \approx 20^\circ$ to $40^\circ$ in fields from $\sim 40$ T to above 60 T. In this work, we studied the $H$ vs $\theta$ phase diagram at a base temperature of $\sim 0.6$ K as a function of Th concentration $x$ in U$_{1-x}$Th$_x$Te$_2$ pseudobinary compounds for $0.5\% \lesssim x \lesssim 4.7\%$. We find that for all values of $x$ within this range, the SC$_{\mathrm{LF}}$ phase is retained with a reduced value of $H_{c2}$ of $\sim 10$ T at $\phi = \theta = 0^\circ$ for $x = 4.7\%$, while the SC$_{\mathrm{HF}}$ phase is suppressed. The SC$_{\mathrm{FP}}$ and FP phases are unaffected to values of $x = 2\%$ but are completely suppressed in the region $x = 2.5$ to $4.7\%$ where the residual resistance ratio RRR has decreased from $\sim 14$ at $x = 1.5\%$ to values of $\sim 3$, indicating a significant increase in disorder.

Title: Finite Disorder Critical Point in the Brittle-to-Ductile Transition of Amorphous Solids in the Presence of Particle Pinning
Authors: Anoop Mutneja, Bhanu Prasad Bhowmik, Smarajit Karmakar
Abstract: The mechanical yielding of amorphous solids under external loading can be broadly classified into ductile and brittle types, depending on whether their macroscopic stress response is smooth or abrupt, respectively. Recently, it has been shown that these two regimes, obtained by tuning the degree of annealing of the system, are separated by a critical point at a finite inherent disorder strength. Here, we demonstrate a transition from brittle yielding to ductile yielding by introducing quenched disorder in the form of randomly pinned particles. The well-annealed samples, which exhibit brittle yielding, undergo a transition to increasingly ductile yielding with increasing pinning concentrations while exhibiting an enhanced stress overshoot. Extensive finite size analysis is performed to demonstrate the critical nature of the transition at a finite pinning concentration and the various scaling exponents obtained are found to be in good agreement with the reported values. Finally, we show a direct correspondence with the shear band width and the critical pining concentration to establish a possible connection between inherent disorder strength and quenched disorder strength due to particle pinning.

Title: Atomic-scale metastable structure formation in nickel-aluminum alloys synthesized far from equilibrium

Abstract: This study reports a new meta-stable structure in epitaxial nickel-aluminum (Ni-Al) films (Al content up to 24.4 at.%) grown on MgO(001) substrates by magnetron sputtering. Structure probes by XRD, HRTEM and nano-indentation combined with atomistic simulations consistently demonstrate that in thin film samples with coexisting {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases, domains of the two phases are homogeneously intermixed at the atomic-scale, forming a coherent matched lattice with one overall lattice parameter. It expands as aluminum (Al) concentration increases, with {\gamma} phase domains being progressively replaced by {\gamma}' phase domains. This behavior is similar to a solid solution, where the atomic-scale domain of the {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases act as solute and solvent, respectively. Isothermal annealing and nanoindentation reveal that the structure decomposes into distinct {\gamma}' and {\gamma} phases due to the loss of lattice matching at 400 °C, resulting in an increase in hardness. This is followed by further relaxation and domain growth at higher temperatures (600 °C and 800 °C), accompanied by a decrease in hardness. These observations confirm the metastable nature of the nanoscale {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases system, enhance the understanding of the Ni-Al alloy system and providing new insights for meta-stable intermetallic thin film synthesis.

Title: The Mottness and the Anderson localization in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$
Authors: Yuxin Wang, Ziyan Chen, Yi Zhang, Kun Jiang, Jiangping Hu
Abstract: The oxygen content plays a pivotal role in determining the electronic properties of the recently discovered La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ superconductors. In this work, we investigate the impact of oxygen vacancies on the insulating behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ across the doping range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$. At $\delta = 0.5$, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model to describe the system. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the model captures the characteristics of a bilayer Mott insulator. To explore the effects of disorder within the range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$, we treat the system as a mixture of metallic and Mott insulating phases. By analyzing the geometric average of the local density of states, we identify an Anderson localization transition occurring around $\delta \sim 0.2$. These results provide a quantitative explanation of recent experimental observations and highlight the critical influence of oxygen content on the physical properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$.

Title: Ion correlations explain kinetic selectivity in diffusion-limited solid state synthesis reactions
Authors: Vir Karan. Max C. Gallant, Yuxing Fei, Gerbrand Ceder, Kristin A. Persson
Abstract: Establishing viable solid-state synthesis pathways for novel inorganic materials remains a major challenge in materials science. Previous pathway design methods using pair-wise reaction approaches have navigated the thermodynamic landscape with first-principles data but lack kinetic information, limiting their effectiveness. This gap leads to suboptimal precursor selection and predictions, especially for reactions forming competing phases with similar formation energies, where ion diffusion is a critical influence. Here, we demonstrate an inorganic synthesis framework by incorporating machine learning-derived transport properties through "liquid-like" product layers into a thermodynamic cellular reaction model. In the Ba-Ti-O system, known for its competitive polymorphism, we obtain accurate predictions of phase formation with varying BaO:TiO2 ratios as a function of time and temperature. We find that diffusion-thermodynamic interplay governs phase compositions, with cross-ion transport coefficients critical for predicting diffusion-limited selectivity. This work bridges length and time scales by integrating solid-state reaction kinetics with first-principles thermodynamics and spatial reactivity.

Title: Boundary-induced Majorana coupling in a planar topological Josephson junction
Authors: Hyeongseop Kim, Sang-Jun Choi, H.-S. Sim, Sunghun Park
Abstract: Understanding environmental effects in a topological Josephson junction is vital for identifying signatures of Majorana modes. We consider a planar Josephson junction formed on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator, which possesses Majorana modes inside the junction and boundary modes outside. We find that tunneling between the inner and outer modes gives rise to effective coupling between the inner Majorana modes, and hence induces energy splitting of their states even in the absence of the direct spatial overlap of their wave functions. The energy splitting is obtained analytically in the weak tunneling limit and is numerically investigated for an arbitrary tunneling strength. We discuss in detail the evolution of the energy splitting with an external perpendicular magnetic field and its effect on the shape of the Fraunhofer pattern.

Title: Theory of Band Gap Reduction Due to Conduction Electrons in 2D TMDs: Imaginary Frequency Formalism
Authors: Jack N. Engdahl, Harley D. Scammell, Dmitry K. Efimkin, Oleg P. Sushkov
Abstract: Two Dimensional (2D) Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) possess a large direct band gap which has been experimentally observed to shrink with increasing charge carrier density (doping). The effect has been the subject of theoretical study in recent years using various approaches and approximations. In this work we develop the theory of bandgap renormalization based on Feynman diagrammatic technique in the imaginary frequency formalism. We consider dynamical screening from conduction band electrons using the random phase approximation (RPA), as well as screening from a metallic gate. While our theory is general for any 2D semiconductor, to be specific we consider MoS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ and compare with available experimental data. In both cases we calculate large band gap renormalization that reaches several hundred meV at relatively low carrier density. This is in good agreement with experimental data.

Title: Analysis of Niobium Electropolishing Using a Generalized Distribution of Relaxation Times Method
Authors: Eric Viklund, Vijay Chouhan, Davida Smith, Tim Ring, David N. Seidman, Sam Posen
Abstract: Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we have devised a method of sensing the microscopic surface conditions on the surface of niobium as it is undergoing an electrochemical polishing (EP) treatment. The method uses electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to gather information on the surface state of the electrode without disrupting the polishing reaction. The EIS data is analyzed using a so-called distribution of relaxation times (DRT) method. Using DRT, the EIS data can be deconvolved into discrete relaxation time peaks without any a priori knowledge of the electrode dynamics. By analyzing the relaxation time peaks, we are able to distinguish two distinct modes of the EP reaction. As the polishing voltage is increased, the electrode transitions from the low voltage EP mode, characterized by a single relaxation time peaks, to the high voltage EP mode, characterized by two relaxation time peaks. We theorize that this second peak is caused by the formation of an oxide layer on the electrode. We also find that this oxide induced peak transitions from to a negative relaxation time, which is indicative of a blocking electrode process. By analyzing EPed samples, we show that samples polished in the low voltage mode have significantly higher surface roughness due to grain etching and faceting. We find that the surface roughness of the samples only improves when the oxide film peak is present and in the negative relaxation time region. This shows that EIS combined with DRT analysis can be used to predict etching on EPed Nb. This method can also be performed before or during the EP, which could allow for adjustment of polishing parameters to guarantee a smooth cavity surface finish.

Title: Observation of Impurity-Induced Scale-Free Localization in a Disordered Non-Hermitian Electrical Circuit
Authors: Hao Wang, Jin Liu, Tao Liu, Wen-Bo Ju
Abstract: One of unique features of non-Hermitian systems is the extreme sensitive to their boundary conditions, e.g., the emergence of non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under the open boundary conditions, where most of bulk states become localized at the boundaries. In the presence of impurities, the scale-free localization can appear, which is qualitatively distinct from the NHSE. Here, we experimentally design a disordered non-Hermitian electrical circuits in the presence of a single non-Hermitian impurity and the nonreciprocal hopping. We observe the anomalous scale-free accumulation of eigenstates, opposite to the bulk hopping direction. The experimental results open the door to further explore the anomalous skin effects in non-Hermitian electrical circuits.

Title: Spin-flip Scattering at the Chiral Interface of Helical Chains
Authors: Keita Matsubara, Kazumasa Hattori
Abstract: We investigate spin-flip scattering processes of electrons when they pass a chiral interface, which is the boundary between right- and left-handed one-dimensional chain. We construct a minimal $p$-orbital model consisting of the right- and left-handed one-dimensional threefold helical chains connected at $z=0$ with the nearest neighbor hopping and the spin-orbit coupling. The dynamics of spin-polarized wave packet passing through the interface, the Green's functions, and electronic states near the interface are analyzed numerically. We find that the microscopic structure of the interface is important and this strongly affects the local electronic orbital state. This in addition to the spin-orbit coupling determines whether the spin flip occurs or not at the chiral interface and suggests a possible spin transport control by the orbital configuration at the chiral interface.

Title: Towards Intelligent Active Particles
Authors: Hartmut Löwen, Benno Liebchen
Abstract: In this book chapter we describe recent applications of artificial intelligence and in particular machine learning to active matter systems. Active matter is composed of agents, or particles, that are capable of propelling themselves. While biological agents like bacteria, fish or birds naturally possess a certain degree of "intelligence", synthetic active particles like colloidal microswimmers and electronic robots can be equipped with different levels of artificial intelligence, either internally (as for robots) or via a dynamic external control system. This book chapter briefly discusses existing approaches to make synthetic particles increasingly "intelligent" and then focuses on the usage of machine learning to approach navigation and communication problems of active particles. Basic questions are how to steer a single active agent through a complex environment to reach or discover a target in an optimal way and how active particles need to cooperate to efficiently collect a distribution of targets (e.g. nutrients or toxins) from their complex environment.

Title: Pressure-induced topological changes in Fermi surface of two-dimensional molecular conductor
Authors: T. Kobayashi, K. Yoshimi, H. Ma, S. Sekine, H. Taniguchi, N. Matsunaga, A. Kawamoto, Y. Uwatoko
Abstract: We demonstrated X-ray structural analysis of the pressure-induced superconductor, $\beta'$-ET$_2$ICl$_2$ under extremely high-pressure conditions, where ET denotes bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene. This material has been known as the highest transition temperature ($T_c$) superconductor among organic superconductors ($T_c=14.2$ K at $8.2$ GPa). On the basis of the experimental results, ab-initio models were derived using the constrained random phase approximation. We revealed that the Lifshitz transition exists behind the Mott insulator-metal transition and found that the value of the on-site Coulomb interaction was halved to around $10$ GPa compared to that at ambient pressure. This study clarifies the enigmatic origins of high $T_{\rm c}$, and concurrently, provides a new understanding of the impacts of structural alterations in organic materials under high pressure on their electronic properties and the superconductivity process.

Title: Classification of pair symmetries in superconductors with unconventional magnetism
Authors: Kazuki Maeda, Yuri Fukaya, Keiji Yada, Bo Lu, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: We consider superconductors with unconventional magnetism and investigate the emergence of superconducting correlations by carrying out a full classification of allowed Cooper pair symmetries. In particular, we focus on spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductors under the influence of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. Under generic conditions, we find that unconventional magnets not only drive a spin-singlet to spin-triplet conversion but also they transfer their parity symmetry that induces superconducting correlations with higher angular momentum. For instance, a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor with $d$-wave altermagnetism is able to host odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $d$-wave superconducting pair amplitudes, while when combining with $p$-wave magnetism the emerging superconducting pairing acquires an even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $p$-wave symmetry. We further demonstrate that unconventional magnetism produces even more exotic superconducting correlations in spin-singlet $d$-wave superconductors, where odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $g$-wave and even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $f$-wave pair symmetries are possible in altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets, respectively. We also discuss how these ideas generalize to spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductors and also show how our results can be applied to unconventional magnets with higher angular momentum, such as $f$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave. Our results can help understand the emergent superconducting correlations due to the interplay of unconventional magnetism and superconductivity.

Title: The Physics of Life: Exploring Information as a Distinctive Feature of Living Systems
Authors: Stuart Bartlett, Andrew W. Eckford, Matthew Egbert, Manasvi Lingam, Artemy Kolchinsky, Adam Frank, Gourab Ghoshal
Abstract: This paper explores the idea that information is an essential and distinctive feature of living systems. Unlike non-living systems, living systems actively acquire, process, and use information about their environments to respond to changing conditions, sustain themselves, and achieve other intrinsic goals. We discuss relevant theoretical frameworks such as ``semantic information'' and ``fitness value of information''. We also highlight the broader implications of our perspective for fields such as origins-of-life research and astrobiology. In particular, we touch on the transition to information-driven systems as a key step in abiogenesis, informational constraints as determinants of planetary habitability, and informational biosignatures for detecting life beyond Earth. We briefly discuss experimental platforms which offer opportunities to investigate these theoretical concepts in controlled environments. By integrating theoretical and experimental approaches, this perspective advances our understanding of life's informational dynamics and its universal principles across diverse scientific domains.

Title: Preformed Cooper Pairs in a Triclinic Iron Pnictide Superconductor
Authors: Zezhong Li, Wenshan Hong, Honglin Zhou, Xiaoyan Ma, Uwe Stuhr, Kaiyue Zeng, Long Ma, Ying Xiang, Huan Yang, Hai-Hu Wen, Jiangping Hu, Shiliang Li, Huiqian Luo
Abstract: Electron pairing along with phase coherence generates superconductivity below the critical temperature ($T_c$). In underdoped high-$T_c$ cuprates, these two quantum phenomena may occur at separate temperatures, which was lately confirmed in the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) iron chalcogenide superconductors. Here, we report a systematic investigation on the pre-pairing behavior in a triclinic iron pnictide superconductor (Ca$_{0.85}$La$_{0.15}$)$_{10}$(Pt$_3$As$_8$)(Fe$_2$As$_2$)$_5$ with $T_c \approx $ 30 K, where the superconductivity is quasi-2D manifested by the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless behaviors. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments unambiguously reveal a spin resonance peak around $E_R =$ 13 meV in the superconducting state, but its intensity continuously decreases when warming up across $T_c$, accompanied with an anomaly around $T^{*}\approx$ 45 K in spin correlations, and a suppression by an in-plane magnetic field persisting to the same temperature. Below $T^{*}$, a significant Nernst signal and a reduction of density of states at the Fermi level are also observed. These results suggest that the precursor of spin resonance is highly related to the preformed Cooper pairs driven by phase fluctuations, much like the pseudogap case in cuprates.

Abstract: ABACUS (Atomic-orbital Based Ab-initio Computation at USTC) is an open-source software for first-principles electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. It mainly features density functional theory (DFT) and is compatible with both plane-wave basis sets and numerical atomic orbital basis sets. ABACUS serves as a platform that facilitates the integration of various electronic structure methods, such as Kohn-Sham DFT, stochastic DFT, orbital-free DFT, and real-time time-dependent DFT, etc. In addition, with the aid of high-performance computing, ABACUS is designed to perform efficiently and provide massive amounts of first-principles data for generating general-purpose machine learning potentials, such as DPA models. Furthermore, ABACUS serves as an electronic structure platform that interfaces with several AI-assisted algorithms and packages, such as DeePKS-kit, DeePMD, DP-GEN, DeepH, DeePTB, etc.

Title: Effect of interface on magnetic exchange coupling in Co/Ru/Co trilayer: from ab-initio simulations to micromagnetics
Authors: Sergiu Arapan, Jan Priessnitz, Alexander Kovacs, Harald Oezelt, David Böhm, Markus Gusenbauer, Thomas Schrefl, Dominik Legut
Abstract: Interfaces play a substantial role for the properties function structured magnetic materials and magnetic multilayers. Modeling the functional behavior of magnetic materials requires treatment of the relevant phenomena at the device level. Properties that arise from the electronic structure and spin dynamics at the atomistic level have to be properly transferred into a continuum level treatment. In this work we show how Co/Ru/Co three layers can be simulated with the continuum theory of micromagnetism, if interface coupling energies and bulk intrinsic properties are derived from the results of ab-initio and spin dynamics simulations at different temperatures.

Title: Revisiting the properties of superfluid and normal liquid ${}^4$He using ab initio potentials
Authors: Tommaso Morresi, Giovanni Garberoglio
Abstract: We investigate the properties of liquid ${}^4$He in both the normal and superfluid phases using path integral Monte Carlo simulations and recently developed ab initio potentials that incorporate pair, three-body, and four-body interactions. By focusing on the energy per particle as a representative observable, we use a perturbative approach to quantify the individual contributions of the many-body potentials and systematically propagate their associated uncertainties. Our findings indicate that the three-body and four-body potentials contribute to the total energy by approximately 4% and 0.4%, respectively. However, the primary limitation in achieving highly accurate first-principles calculations arises from the uncertainty in the four-body potential, which currently dominates the propagated uncertainty. In addition to the energy per particle, we analyze other key observables, including the superfluid fraction, condensed fraction, and pair distribution function, all of which demonstrate excellent agreement with experimental measurements.

Title: Self-sustained Josephson dynamics and self-trapping in supersolids
Authors: Aitor Alaña, Michele Modugno, Pablo Capuzzi, D. M. Jezek
Abstract: We explore the self-sustained Josephson junction dynamics in dipolar supersolids, predicting the possibility of self-trapping alongside the experimentally observed Josephson oscillations [Biagioni, G. et al., Nature 629, 773 (2024)]. Using an asymmetric two-mode (ATM) model to describe a triangular dipolar supersolid, validated through Gross-Pitaevskii simulations, we demonstrate that the system's symmetry enables a consistent two-mode mapping despite the presence of seven droplets. Additionally, we show that bringing the system into rotation preserves its ability to sustain the Josephson junction dynamics across its full range, and we assess the robustness of the ATM model under these conditions.

Title: Beyond the band edge: Unveiling high-mobility hot carriers in a two-dimensional conjugated coordination polymer
Authors: Shuai Fu, Xing Huang, Guoquan Gao, Petko St. Petkov, Wenpei Gao, Jianjun Zhang, Lei Gao, Heng Zhang, Min Liu, Mike Hambsch, Wenjie Zhang, Jiaxu Zhang, Keming Li, Ute Kaiser, Stuart S. P. Parkin, Stefan C. B. Mannsfeld, Tong Zhu, Hai I. Wang, Zhiyong Wang, Renhao Dong, Xinliang Feng, Mischa Bonn
Abstract: Hot carriers, inheriting excess kinetic energy from high-energy photons, underpin numerous optoelectronic applications involving non-equilibrium transport processes. Current research on hot carriers has predominantly focused on inorganic materials, with little attention paid to organic-based systems due to their ultrafast energy relaxation and inefficient charge transport. Here, we overturn this paradigm by demonstrating highly mobile hot carriers in solution-processable, highly crystalline two-dimensional conjugated coordination polymer (2D c-CP) Cu3BHT (BHT = benzenehexathiol) films. Leveraging a suite of ultrafast spectroscopic and imaging techniques, we unravel the microscopic charge transport landscape in Cu3BHT films following non-equilibrium photoexcitation across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains, revealing two distinct high-mobility transport regimes. In the non-equilibrium transport regime, hot carriers achieve ultrahigh mobility of ~2,000 cm2 V-1 s-1, traversing grain boundaries up to 300 nm within a picosecond. In the quasi-equilibrium transport regime, free carriers exhibit Drude-type band-like transport with a remarkable mobility of ~400 cm2 V-1 s-1 and an intrinsic diffusion length exceeding 1 micrometer. These findings establish 2D c-CPs as versatile platforms for exploring high-mobility non-equilibrium transport, unlocking new opportunities for organic-based hot carrier applications.

Title: Investigation on non-ergodicity of protein dynamics
Authors: Luca Maggi
Abstract: The study of microscopic protein dynamics has historically presented significant challenges to researchers seeking to develop a comprehensive and detailed description of its diverse and intriguing features. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have proposed the hypothesis that protein dynamics may be non-ergodic. The implications of this finding are of paramount importance from both a practical and theoretical standpoint. In this study, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to examine these results over a time window spanning from picoseconds to nanoseconds. To this end, we utilize widely used statistical tools. Our findings challenge the conclusions of previous studies, which suggested that proteins exhibit non-ergodic dynamics. Instead, we demonstrate that deviations from ergodic behavior are due to incomplete convergence of the investigated quantities. Additionally, we discuss the implications of findings that suggest a potential breaking of the ergodic hypothesis over larger time windows, which were not directly investigated in this study.

Title: Unconventional bias-dependent tunneling magnetoresistance in van der Waals ferromagnetic/semiconductor heterojunctions
Authors: Wenkai Zhu, Hui Wen, Shouguo Zhu, Qirui Cui, Shihong Xie, Meng Ye, Gaojie Zhang, Hao Wu, Xiaomin Zhang, Weihao Li, Yuqing Huang, Jing Zhang, Lixia Zhao, Amalia Patanè, Haixin Chang, Lin-Wang Wang, Kaiyou Wang
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic/semiconductor heterojunctions represent an ideal platform for studying and exploiting tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effects due to the versatile band structure of semiconductors and their high-quality interfaces. In the all-vdW magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices, both the magnitude and sign of the TMR can be tuned by an applied voltage. Typically, as the bias voltage increases, first the amplitude of the TMR decreases, then the sign of the TMR reverses and/or oscillates. Here, we report on an unconventional bias-dependent TMR in the all-vdW Fe3GaTe2/GaSe/Fe3GaTe2 MTJs, where the TMR first increases, then decreases, and finally undergoes a sign reversal as the bias voltage increases. This dependence cannot be explained by traditional models of MTJs. We propose an in-plane electron momentum (k//) resolved tunneling model that considers both the coherent degree of k// and the decay of the electron wave function through the semiconductor spacer layer. This can explain well the conventional and unconventional bias-dependent TMR. Our results thus provide a deeper understanding of the bias-dependent spin-transport in semiconductor-based MTJs and offer new insights into semiconductor spintronics.

Title: The parametric instability landscape of coupled Kerr parametric oscillators
Authors: Orjan Ameye, Alex Eichler, Oded Zilberberg
Abstract: Networks of coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) hold promise as for the realization of neuromorphic and quantum computation. Yet, their rich bifurcation structure remains largely not understood. Here, we employ secular perturbation theory to map the stability regions of these networks, and identify the regime where the system can be mapped to an Ising model. Starting with two coupled KPOs, we show how the bifurcations arise from the competition between the global parametric drive and linear coupling between the KPOs. We then extend this framework to larger networks with all-to-all equal coupling, deriving analytical expressions for the full cascade of bifurcation transitions. In the thermodynamic limit, we find that these transitions become uniformly spaced, leading to a highly regular structure. Our results reveal the precise bounds under which KPO networks have an Ising-like solution space, and thus provides crucial guidance for their experimental implementation.

Title: Quantum disorder induced by nuclear tunneling in lattice
Authors: Yu-Cheng Zhu, Jia-Xi Zeng, Qi-Jun Ye, Xin-Zheng Li
Abstract: Lattice degrees of freedom (DoFs) may induce quantum disorder (QD) when nuclear tunneling outvies long-range order, but conventional phonon theory is incapable of describing such QD phases. Here we develop a method based on path-integral molecular dynamics to solve this problem. Its accuracy is verified in a double-well chain model and it is applied to a real material from first principles. A quantum order-disorder-order phase transition sequence is demonstrated when varying the strength of quantum fluctuations using the lattice constants as the tuning factor. Combining the excitation spectra and Rényi entanglement entropy, we pinpoint the QD region. This picture may be general in lattice systems having soft phonon modes, not limited to quantum paraelectricity, in which novel entangled lattice motion and its coupling with other DoFs can be expected.

Title: Non-adiabatic linear response in open quantum systems
Authors: Xiaotian Nie, Wei Zheng
Abstract: Adiabatic theorem and non-adiabatic corrections have been widely applied in modern quantum technology. Recently, non-adiabatic linear response theory has been developed to probe the many-body correlations in closed systems. In this work, we generalize the non-adiabatic linear response theory to open quantum many-body systems. We find that the linear deviation from steady states is memory-less, similar to the closed system. The linear response of observables while ramping the Hamiltonian is still related to the derivative of the retarded Green's function. However, as one ramps the dissipation, the corresponding coefficient is determined by a new high-order correlation function in the steady state. Our work gives a neat result and generalizes the tool of ramping dynamics to study the many-body correlations in open quantum systems.

Title: Relative knot probabilities in confined lattice polygons
Authors: EJ Janse van Rensburg, E Orlandini, MC Tesi
Abstract: In this paper we examine the relative knotting probabilities in a lattice model of ring polymers confined in a cavity. The model is of a lattice knot of size $n$ in the cubic lattice, confined to a cube of side-length $L$ and with volume $V=(L{+}1)^3$ sites. We use Monte Carlo algorithms to approximately enumerate the number of conformations of lattice knots in the confining cube. If $p_{n,L}(K)$ is the number of conformations of a lattice polygon of length $n$ and knot type $K$ in a cube of volume $L^3$, then the relative knotting probability of a lattice polygon to have knot type $K$, relative to the probability that the polygon is the unknot (the trivial knot, denoted by $0_1$), is $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1) = p_{n,L}(K)/p_{n,L}(0_1)$. We determine $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1)$ for various knot types $K$ up to six crossing knots. Our data show that these relative knotting probabilities are small so that the model is dominated by lattice polygons of knot type the unknot. Moreover, if the concentration of the monomers of the lattice knot is $\varphi = n/V$, then the relative knot probability increases with $\varphi$ along a curve that flattens off as the Hamiltonian state is approached.

Title: Enhanced condensate fluidity in modified patchy particle models
Authors: Alena Taskina, Devika Magan, Simon Dannenberg, Stefan Klumpp
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are formed via liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins, often together with nucleic acids, typically driven by interactions between low-affinity binding sites. The computational study of such condensates that accounts both for the droplet-scale fluid behavior and the internal structure of the condensate requires coarse-grained models. Recently, patchy particle models, representing proteins as sphere with a repulsive core and directional attractive patches, have emerged as a powerful tool. However, these simulations are typically limited by slow dynamics and struggle to capture the full range of material properties of fluid-like condensates. Here we study modified patchy particle models to simulate the formation and dynamics of biomolecular condensates. By incorporating flexible patches and weak isotropic attractions between cores, our models preserve key equilibrium characteristics, including the phase behavior and the local structure of the condensate, while significantly accelerating the system dynamics. These modifications enable the simulation of larger, more complex systems previously inaccessible due to prohibitive relaxation times and provide a versatile tool for studying condensate dynamics.

Title: Stress-induced phase transformations in Ti-15Mo alloy at elevated temperature
Authors: Petr Harcuba, Tomáš Krajňák, Dalibor Preisler, Jiří Kozlík, Josef Stráský, Jana Šmilauerová, Fernando Gustavo Warchomicka, Miloš Janeček
Abstract: Controlled mechanical loading was applied to Ti-15Mo alloy during annealing at 550 °C. Massive formation of the $\omega_{\textrm{iso}}$ phase from the parent $\beta$-phase occurred during annealing at 550 °C without external stress or with stress well below the yield stress. Moreover, a massive $\alpha$ phase precipitation takes place under simultaneous annealing and plastic deformation. Plastic deformation plays a key role in $\beta\rightarrow\alpha$ transformation and achieving refined $\alpha+\beta$ type microstructure resulted in improved mechanical properties. Studying phase transformations during plastic deformation is critical for understanding and optimizing thermomechanical processing of metastable $\beta$-Ti alloys.

Title: Amp\`ere phase in frustrated magnets
Authors: N. Rougemaille, J. Coraux, B. Canals
Abstract: We report a new class of algebraic spin liquids, in which the macroscopically degenerate ground state manifold is not Coulombic, like in spin ices, but Ampère-like. The local constraint characterizing an Ampère phase is not a Gauss law, but rather an Ampère law, i.e., a condition on the curl of the magnetization vector field and not on its divergence. As a consequence, the excitations evolving in such a manifold are not magnetically charged scalar quasiparticles, the so-called magnetic monopoles in Coulomb phases, but instead vectorial magnetic loops (or fictional current lines). We demonstrate analytically that in a macroscopically degenerate manifold inheriting the properties of a cooperative paramagnet and subject to a local curl-free contraint, magnetic correlations decay in space with a power law whose exponent is the space dimension d: the Ampère phase is a d-algebraic spin liquid. Using Monte Carlo simulations with appropriate cluster dynamics, we confirm this physics numerically in two- and three-dimensional examples, and illustrate how the Ampère phase compares to its Coulomb counterpart.

Title: Unconventional spin Hall effect in $\mathcal {PT}$ symmetric spin-orbit coupled quantum gases
Authors: Hui Tang, Guan-Hua Huang, Shizhong Zhang, Zhongbo Yan, Zhigang Wu
Abstract: We theoretically study the intrinsic spin Hall effect in $\mathcal {PT}$ symmetric, spin-orbit coupled quantum gases confined in an optical lattice. The interplay of the $\mathcal {PT}$ symmetry and the spin-orbit coupling leads to a doubly degenerate non-interacting band structure in which the spin polarization and the Berry curvature of any Bloch state are opposite to those of its degenerate partner. Using experimentally available systems as examples, we show that such a system with a two-component Fermi gas exhibits an intrinsic spin Hall effect akin to that discussed in the context of electronic materials. For a two-component Bose gas, however, an unconventional spin Hall effect emerges in which the spin polarization and the currents are coplanar and the spin Hall conductivity displays a characteristic anisotropy. We propose to detect such an unconventional spin Hall effect in harmonically trapped systems by means of dipole oscillations and perform extensive numerical simulations to verify this proposal. Our work paves the way for the quantum simulation of solid-state intrinsic spin Hall effect and for experimental explorations of unconventional spin Hall effects in quantum gases.

Title: Breakdown of superdiffusion in perturbed quantum integrable spin chains and ladders
Authors: Kevin Wang, Joel E. Moore
Abstract: Superdiffusive transport with dynamical exponent $z=3/2$ has been firmly established at finite temperature for a class of integrable systems with a non-abelian global symmetry $G$. On the inclusion of integrability-breaking perturbations, diffusive transport with $z=2$ is generically expected to hold in the limit of late time. Recent studies of the classical Haldane-Ishimori-Skylanin model have found that perturbations that preserve the global symmetry lead to a much slower timescale for the onset of diffusion, albeit with uncertainty over the exact scaling exponent. That is, for perturbations of strength $\lambda$, the characteristic timescale for diffusion goes as $t_*\sim \lambda^{-\alpha}$ for some $\alpha$. Using large-scale matrix product state simulations, we investigate this behavior for perturbations to the canonical quantum model showing superdiffusion: the $S=1/2$ quantum Heisenberg chain. We consider a ladder configuration and look at various perturbations that either break or preserve the $SU(2)$ symmetry, leading to scaling exponents consistent with those observed in one classical study arXiv:2402.18661: $\alpha=2$ for symmetry-breaking terms and $\alpha=6$ for symmetry-preserving terms. We also consider perturbations from another integrable point of the ladder model with $G=SU(4)$ and find consistent results. Finally, we consider a generalization to an $SU(3)$ ladder and find that the $\alpha=6$ scaling appears to be universal across superdiffusive systems when the perturbations preserve the non-abelian symmetry $G$.

Title: Ising superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric bulk NbSe2

Abstract: Ising superconductivity allows in-plane upper critical magnetic fields to vastly surpass Pauli limit by locking the antiparallel electron spins of Cooper pairs in the out-of-plane direction. It was first explicitly demonstrated in fully two-dimensional monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides with large spin-orbit coupling and broken inversion symmetry. Since then, several studies have shown that it can be present in layered bulk materials, too. In our previous study, we have clarified the underlying microscopic mechanism of Ising superconductivity in bulk, based on a reduced electronic coupling between superconducting layers due to intercalation by insulating layers and restricted inversion symmetry. But earlier studies suggest that in some transition metal dichalcogenide polytypes Pauli paramagnetic limit is violated even without intercalation. Here, using heat capacity measurements we unambiguously demonstrate, that the pristine noncentrosymmetric bulk 4Ha-NbSe2 polytype significantly violates the Pauli limit. The band structure parameters obtained from ab initio calculations using the experimentally determined crystal structure are used in the theoretical model which provides the microscopic mechanism of the Ising protection based solely on broken inversion symmetry.

Title: Resonant inter-mode second harmonic generation by backward spin waves in YIG nano-waveguides
Authors: K. O. Nikolaev, S. R. Lake, B. Das Mohapatra, G. Schmidt, S. O. Demokritov, V. E. Demidov
Abstract: We experimentally study nonlinear generation of the second harmonic by backward volume spin waves propagating in microscopic magnonic waveguides fabricated from a low-loss magnetic insulator with a thickness of several tens of nanometers. We show that highly efficient resonant second harmonic generation is possible in the inter-mode regime at microwave powers of the order of 10^-4 W. In contrast to previously observed second harmonic generation processes, the generation by backward waves is characterized by the nonlinearly generated waves propagating opposite to the initial waves, and can be realized at zero bias magnetic field.

Title: General Solution for Elastic Networks on Arbitrary Curved Surfaces in the Absence of Rotational Symmetry
Authors: Yankang Liu, Siyu Li, Roya Zandi, Alex Travesset
Abstract: Understanding crystal growth over arbitrary curved surfaces with arbitrary boundaries is a formidable challenge, stemming from the complexity of formulating non-linear elasticity using geometric invariant quantities. Solutions are generally confined to systems exhibiting rotational symmetry. In this paper, we introduce a framework to address these challenges by numerically solving these equations without relying on inherent symmetries. We illustrate our approach by computing the minimum energy required for an elastic network containing a disclination at any point and by investigating surfaces that lack rotational symmetry. Our findings reveal that the transition from a defect-free structure to a stable state with a single 5-fold or 7-fold disclination strongly depends on the shape of the domain, emphasizing the profound influence of edge geometry. We discuss the implications of our results for general experimental systems, particularly in elucidating the assembly pathways of virus capsids. This research enhances our understanding of crystal growth on complex surfaces and expands its applications across diverse scientific domains.

Title: Pattern Matching Workflows for EBSD Data Analysis: Quartz Chirality Mapping
Authors: Grzegorz Cios, Aimo Winkelmann, Tomasz Tokarski, Piotr Bała
Abstract: Pattern matching approaches to electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) provide qualitatively new possibilities for the microstructural analysis of chiral non-centrosymmetric phases due to the influence of dynamical electron diffraction effects on the formation of EBSD Kikuchi patterns. In the present study, we analyze the microstructure of polycrystalline alpha-quartz in an agate mineral sample. We identify characteristic intra-grain inversion domains of different handedness which are well-known from classical polarized light microscopy. As a result, the handedness-resolved microstructure of quartz can be imaged with the spatial and orientation resolution provided by EBSD in the SEM.

Title: Revealing Local Structures through Machine-Learning- Fused Multimodal Spectroscopy
Authors: Haili Jia, Yiming Chen, Gi-Hyeok Lee, Jacob Smith, Miaofang Chi, Wanli Yang, Maria K. Y. Chan
Abstract: Atomistic structures of materials offer valuable insights into their functionality. Determining these structures remains a fundamental challenge in materials science, especially for systems with defects. While both experimental and computational methods exist, each has limitations in resolving nanoscale structures. Core-level spectroscopies, such as x-ray absorption (XAS) or electron energy-loss spectroscopies (EELS), have been used to determine the local bonding environment and structure of materials. Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have been applied to extract structural and bonding information from XAS/EELS, but most of these frameworks rely on a single data stream, which is often insufficient. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating multimodal ab initio simulations, experimental data acquisition, and ML techniques for structure characterization. Our goal is to determine local structures and properties using EELS and XAS data from multiple elements and edges. To showcase our approach, we use various lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) oxide compounds which are used for lithium ion batteries, including those with oxygen vacancies and antisite defects, as the sample material system. We successfully inferred local element content, ranging from lithium to transition metals, with quantitative agreement with experimental data. Beyond improving prediction accuracy, we find that ML model based on multimodal spectroscopic data is able to determine whether local defects such as oxygen vacancy and antisites are present, a task which is impossible for single mode spectra or other experimental techniques. Furthermore, our framework is able to provide physical interpretability, bridging spectroscopy with the local atomic and electronic structures.

Title: Simulating inverse patchy colloid models
Authors: Daniele Notarmuzi, Silvano Ferrari, Emanuele Locatelli, Emanuela Bianchi
Abstract: Nano- to micro-sized particles with differently charged surface areas exhibit complex interaction patterns, characterized by both opposite-charge attraction and like-charge repulsion. While several successful models have been proposed in the literature to describe directional attraction, models accounting for both directional attraction and directional repulsion are much less numerous and often tailored to specific microscopic systems. Here we present a simple and versatile patchy model, where the interaction energy of a pair of particles is a sum of interactions between sites of different types located within the particle volume. We implement different formulations of this model in both a self-developed Monte Carlo code and the widely used LAMMPS Molecular Dynamics simulation software, providing basic toolkits for both simulation methods and, in the latter case, for different algorithms. By comparing physical observables and code performances, we discuss the different models, methods, and algorithms, offering insights into optimization strategies and tricks of trade.

Title: WeTICA: A directed search weighted ensemble based enhanced sampling method to estimate rare event kinetics in a reduced dimensional space
Authors: Sudipta Mitra, Ranjit Biswas, Suman Chakrabarty
Abstract: Estimating rare event kinetics from molecular dynamics simulations is a non-trivial task despite the great advances in enhanced sampling methods. Weighted Ensemble (WE) simulation, a special class of enhanced sampling techniques, offers a way to directly calculate kinetic rate constants from biased trajectories without the need to modify the underlying energy landscape using bias potentials. Conventional WE algorithms use different binning schemes to partition the collective variable (CV) space separating the two metastable states of interest. In this work, we have developed a new "binless" WE simulation algorithm to bypass the hurdles of optimizing binning procedures. Our proposed protocol (WeTICA) uses a low-dimensional CV space to drive the WE simulation toward the specified target state. We have applied this new algorithm to recover the unfolding kinetics of three proteins: (A) TC5b Trp-cage mutant, (B) TC10b Trp-cage mutant, and (C) Protein G, with unfolding times spanning the range between 3 and 40 {\mu}s using projections along predefined fixed Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis (TICA) eigenvectors as CVs. Calculated unfolding times converge to the reported values with good accuracy with more than one order of magnitude less cumulative WE simulation time than the unfolding time scales with or without a priori knowledge of the CVs that can capture unfolding. Our algorithm can be used with other linear CVs, not limited to TICA. Moreover, the new walker selection criteria for resampling employed in this algorithm can be used on more sophisticated nonlinear CV space for further improvements of binless WE methods.

Title: Unusual thermal expansion and Curie temperature variation in dhcp-iron hydride under high pressure
Authors: Yuichiro Mori, Katsutoshi Aoki, Masahiro Takano, Hiroyuki Kagi, Ina Park, Zifan Wang, Duck Young Kim, Noriyoshi Tsujino, Sho Kakizawa, Yuji Higo
Abstract: Hydrogen incorporation into iron interstitial sites under high-pressure conditions forms stoichiometric iron monohydride (FeH) with a double hexagonal close-packed (dhcp) structure. This structure is stable over a broad pressure-temperature range, where ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions occur. In this study, using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we identified negative thermal expansion and thermally invariant volume behavior in dhcp-FeH. Our findings, supported by DFT+DMFT calculations, reveal that these thermal effects are governed by magnetic transitions. The Curie temperature decreases linearly with pressure at a rate of about -21 K/GPa, reaching 300 K at 28 GPa. Experimentally measured magnetostriction is an order of magnitude smaller than prior theoretical predictions, possibly due to volume expansion induced by hydrogen incorporation.

Title: Compositional dependence of magnetic damping in sputter-deposited CoxFe1-x thin films
Authors: Samanvaya S. Gaura, Rosa Diaz, Ernesto E. Marinero
Abstract: Co25Fe75 ferromagnetic films exhibit ultralow magnetic damping. The magnetic damping dependence of Cobalt Iron thin films over a Co composition (23 to 36%) is here reported. The thin film structures were sputter deposited at ambient temperature and FMR measurements in both in plane and out of plane geometries were utilized to measure magnetic damping parameters, which include intrinsic damping and contributions from spin pumping. The damping parameters, decrease as the Co content is increased, except for Co31Fe69. The smallest values of damping correspond to alloys exhibiting interface perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. A value of 0.00091 was measured for Co36Fe64, whereas for Co31Fe69 was measured as 0.002, this composition exhibits the largest in-plane anisotropy. HAADF-STEM cross-section analysis of the Co36Fe64 thin film stack revealed Cu interdiffusion into the magnetic layer. The degree of interdiffusion was found to be up to 7x higher at grain boundaries as compared the bulk of the polycrystalline grains. The incorporation of Cu into the ferromagnetic layer adversely impacts magnetic damping. Reducing impurities in the magnetic layer by improving the growth chamber base pressure resulted in a reduction of magnetic damping of 18%. The diffraction analysis revealed that the primary growth direction of Co36Fe64 is [101] and that of Cu buffer layer is [111], these planes are perpendicular to their respective [101] planes and for this composition the lattice mismatch was determined to be 0.9325%. The lattice mismatch decreases with increasing Co content and hence the lattice strain. The diffusion of Cu into the ferromagnet creates magnon scattering centers and local changes in magnetic properties. Both factors negatively influence magnetic damping.

Title: Eigenstate thermalization to non-Gibbs states in strongly-interacting chaotic lattice gases
Authors: Vladimir A. Yurovsky (School of Chemistry, Tel Aviv University), Amichay Vardi (Department of Chemistry, Ben-Gurion University and ITAMP, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)
Abstract: We demonstrate that equilibrium energy distributions in many-body chaotic systems can be qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distributions. This effect can appear in systems with finite energy spectra, which support both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum degeneracy, when the eigenstates fill a substantial part of the Hilbert space. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.

Title: Electronic structure of the Kramers nodal-line semimetal YAuGe

Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals are a class of topological materials hosting one dimensional lines of band degeneracy. Kramers nodal-line (KNL) metals/semimetals have recently been theoretically recognized as a class of topological states inherent to all non-centrosymmetric achiral crystal lattices. We investigate the electronic structure of candidate KNL semimetal YAuGe by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and quantum oscillations as well as by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT has revealed that YAuGe hosts KNLs on the G-A-L-M plane of the Brillouin zone, that are protected by the time reversal and mirror-inversion symmetries. Through ARPES and quantum oscillations we identify signatures of hole bands enclosing the G point, and the observed splitting of quantum oscillation frequency with angle is attributed to spin-orbit-coupling-induced band splitting away from the KNLs. Furthermore, we show that the degeneracy of the nodal lines along the G-A line is lifted by the time-reversal-symmetry breaking when the Y is substituted by magnetic R ions (R = rare earth). This becomes a source of Berry curvature and contributes to the anomalous Hall effect in magnetic RAuGe. These findings establish RAuGe as a new class of KNL semimetals offering significant potential for engineering of anomalous magnetotransport properties via magnetic rare-earth substitution.

Title: Topological Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconducting quantum rings
Authors: Elena Landro', Vladimir M. Fomin, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: Quantum rings have emerged as a playground for quantum mechanics and topological physics, with promising technological applications. Experimentally realizable quantum rings, albeit at the scale of a few nanometers, are 3D nanostructures. Surprisingly, no theories exist for the topology of the Fermi sea of quantum rings, and a microscopic theory of superconductivity in nanorings is also missing. In this paper, we remedy this situation by developing a mathematical model for the topology of the Fermi sea and Fermi surface, which features non-trivial hole pockets of electronic states forbidden by quantum confinement, as a function of the geometric parameters of the nanoring. The exactly solvable mathematical model features two topological transitions in the Fermi surface upon shrinking the nanoring size either, first, vertically (along its axis of revolution) and, then, in the plane orthogonal to it, or the other way round. These two topological transitions are reflected in a kink and in a characteristic discontinuity, respectively, in the electronic density of states (DOS) of the quantum ring, which is also computed. Also, closed-form expressions for the Fermi energy as a function of the geometric parameters of the ring are provided. These, along with the DOS, are then used to derive BCS equations for the superconducting critical temperature of nanorings as a function of the geometric parameters of the ring. The $T_c$ varies non-monotonically with the dominant confinement size and exhibits a prominent maximum, whereas it is a monotonically increasing function of the other, non-dominant, length scale. For the special case of a perfect square toroid (where the two length-scales coincide), the $T_c$ increases monotonically with increasing the confinement size, and in this case, there is just one topological transition.

Title: Edge states and persistent current in a PT-symmetric extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with generic boundary conditions
Authors: Supriyo Ghosh, Pijush K. Ghosh, Shreekantha Sil
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) model by including next-nearest-neighbour(NNN) interaction and balanced loss-gain(BLG), and subjecting the whole system to an external uniform magnetic field. We study the band structure, edge states and persistent current in this extended SSH model under General Boundary Condition(GBC) of which the periodic and open boundary conditions appear as special cases. It is shown that the point band gap decreases with the increasing value of the strength of the NNN interaction and vanish beyond a critical value. Further, the line gap exhibits closed-loop like structures for non-vanishing NNN interaction under the Periodic Boundary Condition(PBC). We show that the NNN interaction has no effect on the persistent current in the half-filled limit for the case of PBC, while for other fillings less than the half-filling, it enhances the magnitude of the current significantly. We numerically study the variation of the persistent current with respect to the system parameters under the GBC, for the case the Hamiltonian admits entirely real spectra. We obtain analytic expressions for the edge states in the case of Open Boundary Condition(OBC) for vanishing NNN this http URL show numerically for OBC that edge states in the topologically trivial phase appear for non vanishing NNN interaction only when the strength of the loss-gain term is greater than the modulus of the difference between the intercell and intracell hopping strengths. In the topologically non-trivial phase, the edge states under OBC exists only up to a critical value of the NNN strength and vanishes beyond this critical value. We show that the NNN interaction, the loss-gain and the boundary terms play a crucial role in the creation and destruction of edge states for the GBC.

Title: CrystalGRW: Generative Modeling of Crystal Structures with Targeted Properties via Geodesic Random Walks
Authors: Krit Tangsongcharoen, Teerachote Pakornchote, Chayanon Atthapak, Natthaphon Choomphon-anomakhun, Annop Ektarawong, Björn Alling, Christopher Sutton, Thiti Bovornratanaraks, Thiparat Chotibut
Abstract: Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.

Title: A study of pendular liquid bridge between two equal solid spheres
Authors: James Q Feng
Abstract: Pendular liquid bridges with concave meridian between two equal rigid spheres are mathematically studied emphasizing on some less analyzed facts in the literature. Discrepancies from numerical solution of the Young-Laplace equation are examined among typical simplifying approximations as well as a few curve-fitting formulas. The separation distance between spheres is shown to play an important role in pendular ring formation via capillary condensation for a given relative humidity as well as the strength of subsequent capillary forces. For most practical situations, the toroidal approximation could be reasonably accurate (especially with diminishing separation distance) and can provide valuable mathematical insights at least in a qualitative sense with its relatively simple analytical formulas. Using the elliptic meridional profile generally offers more accurate approximations, but with so complicated analytical formulas that it would limit its convenience for practical applications. With a few examples, the present study shows that curve-fitting formulas cannot be perfect and by their approximative nature would always leave rooms for improvements; therefore, care should be taken to avoid undesirable errors.

Title: Dielectric permittivity extraction of MoS$_2$ nanoribbons using THz nanoscopy
Authors: Henrik B. Lassen, William V. Carstensen, Denys I. Miakota, Ganesh Ghimire, Stela Canulescu, Peter U. Jepsen, Edmund J. R. Kelleher
Abstract: The nanoscale optical properties of high-quality MoS$_2$ nanoribbons are investigated using THz nanoscopy based on a scattering-type scanning probe. The nanoribbons comprise a multi-layer core, surrounded by monolayer edges. A featureless complex permittivity spectrum covering the range 0.6-1.6 THz is extracted from experimental time-domain measurements through a minimization procedure, adopting an extended finite-dipole model of the probe-sample interaction. Real-space mapping of the nanoribbon reveals variations in the local permittivity down to the instrument-limited resolution, on the order of 30 nm. Clustering analysis statistically identifies regions of lower apparent permittivity that we attribute to a high curvature at the edges of the nanoribbon causing an increase in local material strain or cross-talk in the measured signal with topography-induced measurement artifacts. The core of the nanoribbon contains two regions that follow tightly distributed, but slightly shifted Gaussian statistics in complex permittivity space, with the real part mean of both distributions lying around 5.4 and compatible with literature values of the static permittivity of thin-film MoS$_2$ reported previously. Our results show that the nanoribbons exhibit a modest degree of dielectric variation at the nanoscale that could be explained by heterogeneous doping or variations in the local defect density. We believe that our approach could be useful for the direct real-space measurement of dielectric disorder in other low-dimensional semiconducting material systems.

Title: Predicting Performance of Object Detection Models in Electron Microscopy Using Random Forests
Authors: Ni Li, Ryan Jacobs, Matthew Lynch, Vidit Agrawal, Kevin Field, Dane Morgan
Abstract: Quantifying prediction uncertainty when applying object detection models to new, unlabeled datasets is critical in applied machine learning. This study introduces an approach to estimate the performance of deep learning-based object detection models for quantifying defects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, focusing on detecting irradiation-induced cavities in TEM images of metal alloys. We developed a random forest regression model that predicts the object detection F1 score, a statistical metric used to evaluate the ability to accurately locate and classify objects of interest. The random forest model uses features extracted from the predictions of the object detection model whose uncertainty is being quantified, enabling fast prediction on new, unlabeled images. The mean absolute error (MAE) for predicting F1 of the trained model on test data is 0.09, and the $R^2$ score is 0.77, indicating there is a significant correlation between the random forest regression model predicted and true defect detection F1 scores. The approach is shown to be robust across three distinct TEM image datasets with varying imaging and material domains. Our approach enables users to estimate the reliability of a defect detection and segmentation model predictions and assess the applicability of the model to their specific datasets, providing valuable information about possible domain shifts and whether the model needs to be fine-tuned or trained on additional data to be maximally effective for the desired use case.

Title: Confinement-Driven Acceleration of First-Passage Rates
Authors: Won Kyu Kim
Abstract: We demonstrate that confinement geometry can act as a rectifier in passive diffusion, optimally accelerating first-passage rates beyond free diffusion. Using analytic theory based on the Fick-Jacobs approach and Brownian dynamics simulations, we find nonmonotonic mean first-passage rates driven by entropy. Through the transmission probability, our findings highlight how confinement optimizes transport dynamics in trap-and-escape processes, with implications for molecular translocation and reaction kinetics in soft matter and biological systems.

Title: Magnon cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit system via two-magnon driving and dissipation
Authors: Gang Liu, Gen Li, Huatang Tan, Jie Li
Abstract: We propose an efficient method for dissipative generation of magnonic cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit hybrid system by exploiting a two-magnon driving and dissipation mechanism. When both the magnon and qubit are driven, a coherent nonlinear two-magnon interaction is induced, wherein the qubit and the magnon mode exchange energy through magnon pairs. The dissipation of the qubit is exploited to steer the magnon mode into a quantum superposition of distinct coherent states, where the magnon mode evolves into either an even or odd cat state, depending on the parity of the magnon initial state. For the case where the magnon initial state is a superposition state, e.g., of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, the magnon mode can evolve into a weighted mixture of the even and odd cat states. We also find that magnon squeezed states may emerge during the short-time evolution, showcasing the capability of our mechanism in preparing diverse magnon non-classical states. Magnonic cat and squeezed states are macroscopic quantum states and find applications in macroscopic quantum studies and quantum sensing, e.g., in the dark matter search using ferromagnetic axion haloscopes.

Title: Broad Spectral Tuning of Ultra-Low Loss Polaritons in a van der Waals Crystal by Intercalation
Authors: Javier Taboada-Gutiérrez, Gonzalo Álvarez-Pérez, Jiahua Duan, Weiliang Ma, Kyle Crowley, Iván Prieto, Andrei Bylinkin, Marta Autore, Halyna Volkova, Kenta Kimura, Tsuyoshi Kimura, M.-H. Berger, Shaojuan Li, Qiaoliang Bao, Xuan P.A. Gao, Ion Errea, Alexey Nikitin, Rainer Hillenbrand, Javier Martín-Sánchez, Pablo Alonso-González
Abstract: Phonon polaritons (PhPs) -- light coupled to lattice vibrations -- in polar van der Waals (vdW) crystals are promising candidates for controlling the flow of energy at the nanoscale due to their strong field confinement, anisotropic propagation, and ultra-long lifetime in the picosecond range \cite{ref1,ref2,ref3,ref4,ref5}. However, the lack of tunability in their narrow and material-specific spectral range -- the Reststrahlen Band (RB) -- severely limits their technological implementation. Here, we demonstrate that the intercalation of Na atoms in the vdW semiconductor $\alpha$-V$_2$O$_5$ enables a broad spectral shift of RBs, and that the PhPs excited exhibit ultra-low losses (lifetime of $4 \pm 1$~ps), similar to PhPs in the non-intercalated crystal (lifetime of $6 \pm 1$ ps). We expect our intercalation method to be applicable to other vdW crystals, opening the door for the use of PhPs in broad spectral bands in the mid-infrared domain.

Title: Effect of spontaneous emission on a tanh model
Authors: A. D. Kammogne
Abstract: This study examines the impact of spontaneous emission on a tanh model. The effect is characterized by introducing an imaginary term and a shift in the model, resulting in its non-Hermitian nature. This leads to the appearance of light beams in the population evolution, primarily influenced by the coupling strength and the shift. We derive the necessary conditions to identify the allowed and forbidden regions in the diagram of the real part of the energy. Additionally, we analyze how sweep velocity and time affect the imaginary part of the energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the similarities between our model and the Rabi and Landau-Zener models. Throughout this work, we confirm that our theoretical predictions align well with numerical simulations.

Title: Eigenvector Overlaps of Random Covariance Matrices and their Submatrices
Authors: Elie Attal, Romain Allez
Abstract: We consider the singular vectors of any $m \times n$ submatrix of a rectangular $M \times N$ Gaussian matrix and study their asymptotic overlaps with those of the full matrix, in the macroscopic regime where $N \,/\, M\,$, $m \,/\, M$ as well as $n \,/\, N$ converge to fixed ratios. Our method makes use of the dynamics of the singular vectors and of specific resolvents when the matrix coefficients follow Brownian trajectories. We obtain explicit forms for the limiting rescaled mean squared overlaps for right and left singular vectors in the bulk of both spectra, for any initial matrix $A\,$. When it is null, this corresponds to the Marchenko-Pastur setup for covariance matrices, and our formulas simplify into Cauchy-like functions.

Title: Tunable anharmonicity in cavity optomechanics in the unresolved sideband regime
Authors: Jonathan L. Wise, Clement Dutreix, Fabio Pistolesi
Abstract: Introducing a controlled and strong anharmonicity in mechanical systems is a present challenge of nanomechanics. In cavity optomechanics a mechanical oscillator may be made anharmonic by ponderomotively coupling its motion to the light field of a laser-driven cavity. In the regime where the mechanical resonating frequency and the single-photon coupling constant are small compared to the decay rate of the cavity field, it turns out that the quantum electromagnetic fluctuations of the laser field drive the oscillator into a high-temperature thermal state. The motional state may however be highly non-Gaussian; we show that a precise tuning of system parameters may even lead to a purely quartic effective potential for the mechanical oscillator. We present a theory that predicts the measurable signatures left by the mechanical anharmonicity. In particular, we obtain analytically and numerically the mechanical displacement spectrum, and explore the imprints of the mechanical anharmonicity on the cavity light field.

Title: Implicit Time-Marching for Lagrange Multiplier Formulation for Couple Stress Elastodynamics
Authors: Nicolás Guarín-Zapata, José Ortiz-Ocampo
Abstract: The study of metamaterials and architected materials has increased interest in continuum mechanics models that capture size-dependent microstructure interactions. Among these, Consistent Couple-Stress Theory (C-CST) accounts for mechanical interactions at the microscale adding higher-order derivatives in the strain energy. Previous studies have explored the dynamics of C-CST using methods such as convolutional principles or inverse Laplace transforms to obtain time-dependent solutions. In contrast, our results show that implicit time integration, applied to a mixed finite element method with a Lagrange multiplier, provides direct time-domain solutions for dynamic C-CST modeling and ensures solution stability. In particular, the proposed finite element scheme is verified in comparison with results from previous literature, by employing the Method of Manufactured Solutions in the static case and dynamic simulations of simple cases. The approach presented introduces new tools for studying size-dependent material behavior, laying the groundwork for further applications in advanced material design and wave propagation studies.

Title: Calibration of Scanning Thermal Microscope using Optimal Estimation of Function Parameters by Iterated Linearization
Authors: Anna Charvátová Campbell, Petr Klapetek, Radek Šlesinger, Jan Martinek, Václav Hortvík, Viktor Witkovský, Gejza Wimmer
Abstract: Scanning thermal microscopy is a unique tool for the study of thermal properties at the nanoscale. However, calibration of the method is a crucial problem. When analyzing local thermal conductivity, direct calibration is not possible and reference samples are used instead. As the calibration dependence is non-linear and there are only a few calibration points, this represents a metrological challenge that needs complex data processing. In this contribution we present use of the OEFPIL algorithm for robust and single-step evaluation of local thermal conductivities and their uncertainties, simplifying this procedure. Furthermore, we test the suitability of SThM calibration for automated measurement.

Abstract: The following letter presents a novel, multi-length-scale characterization approach for investigating doping chemistry and spatial distributions within semiconductors, as demonstrated using a state-of-the-art CMOS image sensor. With an intricate structural layout and varying doping types/concentration levels, this device is representative of the current challenges faced in measuring dopants within confined volumes using conventional techniques. Focused ion beam-secondary ion mass spectrometry is applied to produce large-area compositional maps with nanoscale resolution, while atom probe tomography is used to extract quantitative dopant profiles. Leveraging the complementary capabilities of the two methods, this workflow is shown to be an effective approach for resolving nano- and micro- scale dopant information, crucial for optimizing the performance and reliability of advanced semiconductor devices.

Title: Towards Fast, Specialized Machine Learning Force Fields: Distilling Foundation Models via Energy Hessians
Authors: Ishan Amin, Sanjeev Raja, Aditi Krishnapriyan
Abstract: The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.

Authors: Javier Martín-Sánchez, Rinaldo Trotta, Giovanni Piredda, Christian Schimpf, Giovanna Trevisi, Luca Seravalli, Paola Frigeri, Sandra Stroj, Thomas Lettner, Marcus Reindl, Johannes S. Wildmann, Johannes Edlinger, Armando Rastelli
Abstract: Strain engineering allows the physical properties of materials and devices to be widely tailored, as paradigmatically demonstrated by strained transistors and semiconductor lasers employed in consumer electronics. For this reason, its potential impact on our society has been compared to that of chemical alloying. Although significant progress has been made in the last years on strained nanomaterials, strain fields (which are of tensorial nature, with six independent components) are still mostly used in a "scalar" and/or static fashion. Here we present a new class of strain actuators which allow the three components of the in-plane stress tensor in a nanomembrane to be independently and reversibly controlled. The actuators are based on monolithic piezoelectric substrates, which are micro-machined via femtosecond-laser processing. Their functionality is demonstrated by "programming" arbitrary stress states in a semiconductor layer, whose light emission is used as a local and sensitive strain gauge. The results shown in this work open a new route to investigate and make use of strain effects in materials and devices.

Title: Orthogonality catastrophe beyond bosonization from post-selection
Authors: Martino Stefanini, Jamir Marino
Abstract: We show that the dynamics induced by post-selected measurements can serve as a controlled route to access physical processes beyond the boundaries of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid physics. We consider a one-dimensional fermionic wire whose dynamics results from a sequence of weak measurements of the fermionic density at a given site, interspersed with unitary hopping dynamics. This realizes a non-Hermitian variant of the celebrated instance of a local scatterer in a fermionic system and its ensuing orthogonality catastrophe. We observe a distinct crossover in the system's time evolution as a function of the fermion density. In the high-density regime, reminiscent of the Hermitian case, a bosonized version of the model properly describes the dynamics while, as we delve into the low-density regime, the validity of bosonization breaks down, giving rise to irreversible behavior. Notably, this crossover from reversible to irreversible dynamics is non-perturbative in the measurement rate and can manifest itself even with relatively shallow measurement rates, provided that the system's density remains below the crossover threshold. Our results render a conceptually transparent model for exploring non-perturbative effects beyond bosonization, which could be used as a stepping stone to explore novel routes for the control of non-linear dynamics in low-dimensional quantum systems.

Title: Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Periodically-Driven Dissipative Ultracold Atoms
Authors: Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu, Zhongmin Yang
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), featured by the collapse of bulk-band eigenstates into the localized boundary modes of the systems, is one of most striking properties in the fields of non-Hermitian physics. Unique physical phenomena related to the NHSE have attracted a lot of interest, however, their experimental realizations usually require nonreciprocal hopping, which faces a great challenge in ultracold-atom systems. In this work, we propose to realize the NHSE in a 1D optical lattice by periodically-driven ultracold atoms in the presence of staggered atomic loss. By studying the effective Floquet Hamiltonian in the high-frequency approximation, we reveal the underlying mechanism for the periodic-driving-induced the NHSE. We found that the robust NHSE can be tuned by driving phase, which is manifested by the dynamical localization. Most remarkably, we uncover the periodic-driving-induced critical skin effect for two coupled chains with different driving phases, accompanied by the appearance of size-dependent topological in-gap modes. Our studies provide a feasible way for observing the NHSE and exploring corresponding unique physical phenomena due to the interplay of non-Hermiticity and many-body statistics in ultracold-atom systems.

Title: Interface probe for antiferromagnets using geometric curvature
Authors: Tancredi Salamone, Magnus Skjærpe, Henning G. Hugdal, Morten Amundsen, Sol H. Jacobsen
Abstract: We propose that geometric curvature and torsion may be used to probe the quality of an uncompensated antiferromagnetic interface, using the proximity effect. We study a helix of antiferromagnetic wire coupled to a conventional superconductor, and show that a density of states measurement can give information about the quality of an uncompensated interface, crucial for many recently predicted antiferromagnetic proximity effects. Furthermore, we show that geometric curvature alone can result in long-ranged superconducting triplet correlations in the antiferromagnet, and we discuss the impact curvature and torsion can have on the future development of superconducting spintronic devices.

Title: On the cuprates' universal waterfall feature: evidence of a momentum-driven crossover

Abstract: We study two related universal anomalies of the spectral function of cuprates, so called waterfall and high-energy kink features, by a combined cellular dynamical mean-field theory and angle-resolved photoemission study for the oxychloride Na$_x$Ca$_{2-x}$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ (Na-CCOC). Tracing their origin back to an interplay of spin-polaron and local correlation effects both in undoped and hole-doped (Na-)CCOC, we establish them as a universal crossover between regions differing in the momentum dependence of the coupling and not necessarily in the related quasiparticles' energies. The proposed scenario extends to doping levels coinciding with the cuprate's superconducting dome and motivates further investigations of the fate of spin-polarons in the superconducting phase.

Title: Absence of a dissipative quantum phase transition in Josephson junctions: Theory
Authors: Carles Altimiras, Daniel Esteve, Çağlar Girit, Hélène le Sueur, Philippe Joyez
Abstract: We investigate the resistively shunted Josephson junction (RSJ) at equilibrium, using linear response, an exact path integral technique and symmetry considerations. All three approaches independently lead to conclude that the superconducting - insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in the RSJ, cannot exist. For all parameters, we find that shunting a junction makes it more superconducting. We reveal that the UV cutoff of the resistor plays an unforeseen key role in these systems, and show that the erroneous prediction of an insulating state resulted in part from assuming it would not. We also explain why the RSJ physics differs from that of 1D quantum impurity problems. Our results fully support and confirm the experimental invalidation of this quantum phase transition by Murani et al. in 2020.

Title: Localization-Delocalization Transitions in Non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm Cages
Authors: Xiang Li, Jin Liu, Tao Liu
Abstract: A unique feature of non-Hermitian systems is the extreme sensitivity of the eigenspectrum to boundary conditions with the emergence of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). A NHSE originates from the point-gap topology of complex eigenspectrum, where an extensive number of eigenstates are anomalously localized at the boundary driven by nonreciprocal dissipation. Two different approaches to create localization are disorder and flat-band spectrum, and their interplay can lead to the anomalous inverse Anderson localization, where the Bernoulli anti-symmetric disorder induce mobility in a full-flat band system in the presence of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) Cage. In this work, we study the localization-delocalization transitions due to the interplay of the point-gap topology, flat band and correlated disorder in the one-dimensional rhombic lattice, where both its Hermitian and non-Hermitian structures show AB cage in the presence of magnetic flux. Although it remains the coexistence of localization and delocalization for the Hermitian rhombic lattice in the presence of the random anti-symmetric disorder, it surprisingly becomes complete delocalization, accompanied by the emergence of NHSE. To further study the effects from the Bernoulli anti-symmetric disorder, we found the similar NHSE due to the interplay of the point-gap topology, correlated disorder and flat bands. Our anomalous localization-delocalization property can be experimentally tested in the classical physical platform, such as electrical circuit.

Title: Superfluid fraction of interacting bosonic gases
Authors: Daniel Pérez-Cruz, Grigori E. Astrakharchik, Pietro Massignan
Abstract: The superfluid fraction $f$ of a quantum fluid is defined in terms of the response of the system to a weak and constant drag. Notably, Leggett long ago derived two simple expressions providing a rigorous upper bound and a heuristic lower bound for $f$. Here we study the superfluid fraction of bosonic gases in various two-dimensional potentials, such as regular optical lattices and disordered speckles, by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and performing Diffusion Monte Carlo simulations. We show that under conditions relevant for most ultracold experiments the bounds proposed by Leggett provide a surprisingly narrow bracketing of the exact value of the superfluid fraction.

Title: Symmetry Origin and Microscopic Mechanism of Electrical Magnetochiral Anisotropy in Tellurium
Authors: Manuel Suárez-Rodríguez, Beatriz Martín-García, Francesco Calavalle, Stepan S. Tsirkin, Ivo Souza, Fernando De Juan, Albert Fert, Marco Gobbi, Luis E. Hueso, Fèlix Casanova
Abstract: Non-linear transport effects in response to external magnetic fields, i.e. electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA), have attracted much attention for their importance to study quantum and spin-related phenomena. Indeed, they have permitted the exploration of topological surface states and charge-to-spin conversion processes in low-symmetry systems. Nevertheless, despite the inherent correlation between the symmetry of the material under examination and its non-linear transport characteristics, there is a lack of experimental demonstration to delve into this relationship and to unveil their microscopic mechanisms. Here, we study eMChA in chiral elemental Tellurium (Te) along different crystallographic directions, establishing the connection between the different eMChA components and the crystal symmetry of Te. We observed different longitudinal eMChA components with collinear current and magnetic field, demonstrating experimentally the radial angular momentum texture of Te. We also measured a transverse non-linear resistance which, as the longitudinal counterpart, scales bilinearly with current and magnetic fields, illustrating that they are different manifestations of the same effect. Finally, we study the scaling law of the eMChA, evidencing that extrinsic scattering from dynamic sources is the dominant microscopic mechanism. These findings underscore the efficacy of symmetry-based investigations in understanding and predicting non-linear transport phenomena, with potential applications in spintronics and energy harvesting.

Title: Energy landscape interpretation of universal linearly increasing absorption with frequency
Authors: Sverre Holm, Joakim Bergli
Abstract: Absorption of elastic waves in complex media is commonly found to increase linearly with frequency, for both longitudinal and shear waves. This ubiquitous property is observed in media such as rocks, unconsolidated sediments, and human tissue. Absorption is due to relaxation processes at the level of atomic scales and up to the sub-micron scale of biological materials. The effect of these processes is usually expressed as an integral over relaxation frequencies or relaxation times. Here we argue that these processes are thermally activated. Unusual for ultrasonics and seismics, we can therefore transform the expression for absorption from the frequency or time domains to an integral over an activation energy landscape weighted by an energy distribution. The universal power-law property surprisingly corresponds to a flat activation energy landscape. This is the solution which maximizes entropy or randomness. Therefore the linearly increasing absorption corresponds to the energy landscape with the fewest possible constraints.

Authors: M. A. Moreno-Armijos, A. R. Fritsch, A. D. García-Orozco, S. Sab, G. Telles, Y. Zhu, L. Madeira, S. Nazarenko, V. I. Yukalov, V. S. Bagnato
Abstract: The dynamics of non-equilibrium closed quantum systems and their route to thermalization are of fundamental interest to several fields, from cosmology to particle physics. However, a comprehensive description of non-equilibrium phenomena still presents a significant challenge. In this work, we report the observation of distinct stages during the relaxation of the decaying turbulence in trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. Our findings show a direct particle cascade from low to high momenta, a consequence of the energy injection in the system, exhibiting a characteristic universal scaling. This stage is followed by an inverse particle cascade responsible for repopulating the previously depleted condensate. Both cascades can be explained through self-similar solutions provided by wave turbulence theory. These findings provide important insights into the relaxation stages of out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.

Title: Pseudomode expansion of many-body correlation functions
Authors: Alexander Teretenkov, Filipp Uskov, Oleg Lychkovskiy
Abstract: We present an expansion of a many-body correlation function in a sum of pseudomodes -- exponents with complex frequencies that encompass both decay and oscillations. The pseudomode expansion emerges in the framework of the Heisenberg version of the recursion method. This method essentially solves Heisenberg equations in a Lanczos tridiagonal basis constructed in the Krylov space of a given observable. To obtain pseudomodes, we first add artificial dissipation satisfying the dissipative generalization of the universal operator growth hypothesis, and then take the limit of the vanishing dissipation strength. Fast convergence of the pseudomode expansion is facilitated by the localization in the Krylov space, which is generic in the presence of dissipation and can survive the limit of the vanishing dissipation strength. As an illustration, we present pseudomode expansions of infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions in the quantum Ising and $XX$ spin-$1/2$ models on the square lattice. It turns out that it is enough to take a few first pseudomodes to obtain a good approximation to the correlation function.

Title: Fluctuating magnetism and Pomeranchuk effect in multilayer graphene
Authors: Ludwig Holleis, Tian Xie, Siyuan Xu, Haoxin Zhou, Caitlin L. Patterson, Archisman Panigrahi, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Leonid S. Levitov, Chenhao Jin, Erez Berg, Andrea F. Young
Abstract: Magnetism typically arises from the effect of exchange interactions on highly localized fermionic wave functions in f- and d-atomic orbitals. In rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG), in contrast, magnetism-manifesting as spontaneous polarization into one or more spin and valley flavors[1-7]-originates from itinerant electrons near a Van Hove singularity. Here, we show experimentally that the electronic entropy in this system shows signatures typically associated with disordered local magnetic moments, unexpected for electrons in a fully itinerant metal. Specifically, we find a contribution $\Delta$ S $\approx$ 1k$_B$/charge carrier that onsets at the Curie temperature and survives over one order of magnitude in temperature. First order phase transitions show an isospin `Pomeranchuk effect' in which the fluctuating moment phase is entropically favored over the nearby symmetric Fermi liquid[8, 9]. Our results imply that despite the itinerant nature of the electron wave functions, the spin- and valley polarization of individual electrons are decoupled, a phenomenon typically associated with localized moments, as happens, for example, in solid 3He[10]. Transport measurements, surprisingly, show a finite temperature resistance minimum within the fluctuating moment regime, which we attribute to the interplay of fluctuating magnetic moments and electron phonon scattering. Our results highlight the universality of soft isospin modes to two-dimensional flat band systems.

Title: Cluster Sliding Ferroelectricity in Trilayer Quasi-Hexagonal C$_{60}$
Authors: Xuefei Wang, Yanhan Ren, Shi Qiu, Fan Zhang, Xueao Li, Junfeng Gao, Weiwei Gao, Jijun Zhao
Abstract: Electric polarization typically originates from non-centrosymmetric charge distributions in compounds. In elemental crystalline materials, chemical bonds between atoms of the same element favor symmetrically distributed electron charges and centrosymmetric structures, making elemental ferroelectrics rare. Compared to atoms, elemental clusters are intrinsically less symmetric and can have various preferred orientations when they are assembled to form crystals. Consequently, the assembly of clusters with different orientations tends to break the inversion symmetry. By exploiting this concept, we show that sliding ferroelectricity naturally emerges in trilayer quasi-hexagonal phase (qHP) C$_{60}$, a cluster-assembled carbon allotrope recently synthesized. Compared to many metallic or semi-metallic elemental ferroelectrics, trilayer qHP C$_{60}$'s have sizable band gaps and several ferroelectric structures, which are distinguishable by measuring their second-harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Some of these phases show both switchable out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations on the order of 0.2 pC/m. The out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations can be switched independently and enable an easy-to-implement construction of Van der Waals homostructures with ferroelectrically switchable chirality.

Title: Orbital moir\'e and quadrupolar triple-q physics in a triangular lattice
Authors: K. Hattori, T. Ishitobi, H. Tsunetsugu
Abstract: We numerically study orders of planer type $(xy,x^2-y^2)$ quadrupoles on a triangular lattice with nearest-neighbor isotropic $J$ and anisotropic $K$ interactions. This type of quadrupoles possesses unique single-ion anisotropy proportional to a third order of the quadrupole moments. This provides an unconventional mechanism of triple-$q$ orders which does not exist for the degrees of freedom with odd parity under time-reversal operation such as magnetic dipoles. In addition to several single-$q$ orders, we find various orders including incommensurate triple-$q$ quasi-long-range orders with orbital moiré and a four-sublattice triple-$q$ partial order. Our Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate that the phase transition to the latter triple-$q$ state belongs to the universality class of the critical line of the Ashkin-Teller model in two dimensions close to the four-state Potts class. These results indicate a possibility of realizing unique quadrupole textures in simple triangular systems.

Title: Insulator-Metal Transition and Magnetic Crossover in Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Amarnath Chakraborty, Aleksandr Rodin, Shaffique Adam, Giovanni Vignale
Abstract: In-plane magnetic fields offer a relatively unexplored opportunity to alter the band structure of stacks of 2D materials so that they exhibit desired physical properties. Here we show that an in-plane magnetic field combined with a transverse electric field can induce an insulator-metal (IM) transition in bilayer graphene. Our study of the magnetic response reveals that the orbital magnetic susceptibility changes from diamagnetic to paramagnetic around the transition point. We discuss several strategies to observe the IM transition, switch the diamagnetism, and more generally control the band structure of stacked 2D materials at experimentally accessible magnetic fields.

Title: Electron ptychography reveals a ferroelectricity dominated by anion displacements
Authors: Harikrishnan KP, Ruijuan Xu, Kinnary Patel, Kevin J. Crust, Aarushi Khandelwal, Chenyu Zhang, Sergey Prosandeev, Hua Zhou, Yu-Tsun Shao, Laurent Bellaiche, Harold Y. Hwang, David A. Muller
Abstract: Sodium niobate, a lead-free ferroic material, hosts delicately-balanced, competing order parameters, including ferroelectric states that can be stabilized by epitaxial strain. Here, we show that the resulting macroscopic ferroelectricity exhibits an unconventional microscopic structure using multislice electron ptychography. This technique overcomes multiple scattering artifacts limiting conventional electron microscopy, enabling both lateral spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit and recovery of three-dimensional structural information. These imaging capabilities allow us to separate the ferroelectric interior of the sample from the relaxed surface structure and identify the soft phonon mode and related structural distortions with picometer precision. Unlike conventional ferroelectric perovskites, we find that the polar distortion in this material involves minimal distortions of the cation sublattices and is instead dominated by anion displacements relative to the niobium sublattice. We establish limits on film thickness for interfacial octahedral rotation engineering and directly visualize a random octahedral rotation pattern, arising from the flat dispersion of the associated phonon mode.

Title: Two-dimensional Kagome Materials: Theoretical Insights, Experimental Realizations, and Electronic Structures
Authors: Zhongqin Zhang, Jiaqi Dai, Cong Wang, Hua Zhu, Fei Pang, Zhihai Cheng, Wei Ji
Abstract: In recent years, kagome materials have attracted significant attention due to their rich emergent phenomena arising from the quantum interplay of geometry, topology, spin, and correlations. However, in the search for kagome materials, it has been found that bulk compounds with electronic properties related to the kagome lattice are relatively scarce, primarily due to the hybridization of kagome layers with adjacent layers. Therefore, researchers have shown increasing interest in the discovery and construction of two-dimensional (2D) kagome materials, aiming to achieve clean kagome bands near the Fermi level in monolayer or few-layer systems. Substantial advancements have already been made in this area. In this review, we summarize the current progress in the construction and development of 2D kagome materials. We begin by introducing the geometric and electronic structures of the kagome lattice model and its variants, followed by discussions on the experimental realizations and electronic structure characterizations of 2D kagome materials. Finally, we provide an outlook on the future developments of 2D kagome materials.

Title: Amplifying the antiferromagnetic spin Seebeck effect through topological magnons
Authors: Feodor Svetlanov Konomaev, Kjetil M. D. Hals
Abstract: Topological magnons emerge as topologically protected spin wave states at the edges of magnets. Here, we theoretically explore how these surface states can be harnessed to amplify the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in antiferromagnets (AFMs) interfaced with normal metals (NMs). Based on a microscopic model of a kagome AFM, we demonstrate that broken mirror symmetry, combined with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), drives the system into a topological phase hosting spin-polarized magnons at the boundaries. Notably, linear response calculations reveal that in AFM/NM heterostructures, the topological magnons exhibit strong coupling to the metal's charge carriers, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the SSE. The relative contribution of the topological magnons is found to be 4-5 times greater than that of the trivial magnon bands. Moreover, our results show that this enhancement is highly sensitive to the strength of the DMI.

Title: Accelerating the discovery of low-energy structure configurations: a computational approach that integrates first-principles calculations, Monte Carlo sampling, and Machine Learning
Authors: Md Rajib Khan Musa, Yichen Qian, Jie Peng, David Cereceda
Abstract: Finding Minimum Energy Configurations (MECs) is essential in fields such as physics, chemistry, and materials science, as they represent the most stable states of the systems. In particular, identifying such MECs in multi-component alloys considered candidate PFMs is key because it determines the most stable arrangement of atoms within the alloy, directly influencing its phase stability, structural integrity, and thermo-mechanical properties. However, since the search space grows exponentially with the number of atoms considered, obtaining such MECs using computationally expensive first-principles DFT calculations often results in a cumbersome task. To escape the above compromise between physical fidelity and computational efficiency, we have developed a novel physics-based data-driven approach that combines Monte Carlo sampling, first-principles DFT calculations, and Machine Learning to accelerate the discovery of MECs in multi-component alloys. More specifically, we have leveraged well-established Cluster Expansion (CE) techniques with Local Outlier Factor models to establish strategies that enhance the reliability of the CE method. In this work, we demonstrated the capabilities of the proposed approach for the particular case of a tungsten-based quaternary high-entropy alloy. However, the method is applicable to other types of alloys and enables a wide range of applications.

Title: Spectral function of a bipolaron coupled to dispersive optical phonons
Authors: K. Kovač, J. Bonča
Abstract: Using an efficient variational exact diagonalization method, we computed the electron removal spectral function within the framework of the Holstein-Hubbard model containing two electrons with opposite spins coupled to dispersive quantum optical phonons. Our primary focus was examining the interplay between phonon dispersion and Coulomb repulsion and their effects on the single-electron removal spectral function, relevant for the analysis of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Tuning the strengths of the electron-phonon coupling and the Hubbard interaction allows us to examine the evolution of the spectral properties of the system as it crosses over from a bound bipolaron to separate polarons. With increasing Hubbard repulsion, the decrease of the bipolaron binding energy results in the gradual downward shift of the polaron band - a low-frequency feature in the spectral function. Simultaneously, the intensity of the polaron band away from the center of the Brillouin zone diminishes until it remains non-zero only in its center as the bipolaron unbinds into two separate polarons. The spectral function is significantly influenced by phonon dispersion, particularly in systems with strong electron-phonon coupling. The sign of the curvature of the phonon band plays a crucial role in the distribution of spectral weight.

Title: Electromagnetic response in dipole superfluids: vortex lattices and singular domain walls
Authors: Kazuki Yamamoto, Takuto Kawakami, Mikito Koshino
Abstract: Among the most significant macroscopic quantum phenomena in condensed matter physics is the Meissner effect observed in superconductivity, which arises from the unique interaction between superfluids of charged particles and electromagnetic fields. However, superfluids can also emerge from particles possessing distinct electromagnetic properties. In particular, there has been growing interest in superfluids composed of charge-neutral particles with magnetic or electric dipole moments, such as Bose-Einstein condensates of magnons or excitons. Despite this interest, the electromagnetic response of dipole superfluids, including potential analogs or contrasts to the Meissner effect, remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a Ginzburg-Landau phenomenological theory to describe magnetic and electric dipole superfluids subjected to pseudo-magnetic fields induced by geometric phases. For magnetic dipole superfluids interacting with the Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase, we find that they form vortex lattices with sharply localized pseudo-magnetic fields along hexagonal domain walls, leading to singular and discontinuous change of physical variables at these boundaries. For electric dipole superfluids influenced by the He-McKellar-Wilkens (HMW) phase, in contrast, we identify vortex lattices where the pseudo-magnetic field and supercurrent are concentrated at vortex cores, resembling superconductors. These results reveal strikingly different electromagnetic responses in dipole superfluids, opening new directions for exploring superfluid systems with unconventional electromagnetic responses.

Title: Direct observation of thermal hysteresis in the molecular dynamics of orientationally disordered barocalorics
Authors: Frederic Rendell-Bhatti, Markus Appel, Connor S. Inglis, Melony Dilshad, Neha Mehta, Jonathan Radcliffe, Xavier Moya, Donald A. MacLaren, David Boldrin
Abstract: Barocalorics (BCs) are emerging as promising alternatives to vapour-phase refrigerants, which are problematic as they exacerbate climate change when they inevitably leak into the atmosphere. However, the commercialisation of BC refrigerants is significantly hindered by hysteresis in the solid-solid phase transition that would be exploited in a refrigeration cycle. Here, we provide new insight into the hysteresis that is a critical step towards the rational design of viable BCs. By studying the archetypal BC plastic crystal, neopentyl glycol (NPG), we observe for the first time the liberation of the hydroxyl rotational modes that unlock the hydrogen bonding network. We use high-resolution inelastic fixed-window neutron scattering studies in combination with quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements to build a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the NPG phase transition. Hysteresis previously observed in calorimetric studies of NPG is now observed directly as hysteresis in molecular rotational modes, and hence in the formation and disruption of hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, by tracking the thermal activation of three main reorientation modes, we suggest that their fractional excitations may resolve an outstanding discrepancy between measured and calculated entropy change. These results allow for direct study of the molecular dynamics that govern the thermal hysteresis of small molecule energy materials. They will be broadly applicable, as many promising BC material families possess first-order transitions involving molecular reorientations.

Title: Microwave power and chamber pressure studies for single-crystalline diamond film growth using microwave plasma CVD
Authors: Truong Thi Hien, Jaesung Park, Cuong Manh Nguyen, Jeong Hyun Shim, Sangwon Oh
Abstract: A smooth diamond film, characterized by exceptional thermal conductivity, chemical stability, and optical properties, is highly suitable for a wide range of advanced applications. However, achieving uniform film quality presents a significant challenge for the CVD method due to non-uniformities in microwave distribution, electric fields, and the densities of reactive radicals during deposition processes involving $CH_4$ and $H_2$ precursors. Here, we systematically investigate the effects of microwave power and chamber pressure on surface roughness, crystalline quality, and the uniformity of diamond films. These findings provide valuable insights into the production of atomically smooth, high-quality diamond films with enhanced uniformity. By optimizing deposition parameters, we achieved a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 2 nm, comparable to high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) diamond substrates. Moreover, these conditions facilitated the formation of a pure single-crystal diamond phase, confirmed by the absence of contamination peaks in the Raman spectra

Title: Electron-irradiation effects on monolayer MoS2 at elevated temperatures
Authors: Carsten Speckmann, Kimmo Mustonen, Diana Propst, Clemens Mangler, Jani Kotakoski
Abstract: The effect of electron irradiation on 2D materials is an important topic, both for the correct interpretation of electron microscopy experiments and for possible applications in electron lithography. After the importance of including inelastic scattering damage in theoretical models describing beam damage, and the lack of oxygen-sensitivity under electron irradiation in 2D MoS2 were recently shown, the role of temperature has remained unexplored on a quantitative level. Here we show the effect of temperature on both the creation of individual defects as well as the effect of temperature on defect dynamics. Based on the measured displacement cross section of sulphur atoms in MoS2 by atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, we find an increased probability for defect creation for temperatures up to 150°C, in accordance with theoretical predictions. However, higher temperatures lead to a decrease of the observed cross sections. Despite this apparent decrease, we find that the elevated temperature does not mitigate the creation of defects as this observation would suggest, but rather hides the created damage due to rapid thermal diffusion of the created vacancies before their detection, leading to the formation of vacancy lines and pores outside the measurement's field of view. Using the experimental data in combination with previously reported theoretical models for the displacement cross section, we estimate the migration energy barrier of sulphur vacancies in MoS2 to be 0.26 +- 0.13 eV. These results mark another step towards the complete understanding of electron beam damage in MoS2.

Title: Switchable Skyrmion-Antiskyrmion Tubes in Rhombohedral BaTiO$_\mathrm{3}$ and Related Materials
Authors: Fernando Gómez-Ortiz, Louis Bastogne, Sriram Anand, Miao Yu, Xu He, Philippe Ghosez
Abstract: Skyrmions are stable topological textures that have garnered substantial attention within the ferroelectric community for their exotic functional properties. While previous studies have questioned the feasibility of [001]$_{\text{pc}}$ skyrmion tubes in rhombohedral BaTiO$_3$ due to the high energy cost of 180$^\circ$ domain walls, we demonstrate here their stabilization with topological charges of $\mathcal{Q} = \pm 1$ from density functional theory and second-principles calculations. By enabling extensive vortex and antivortex polarization configurations, the expected prohibitive energetic barriers are overcomed while preserving the topological nature of the structures. Notably, we extend these findings to demonstrate the appearance of skyrmion and antiskyrmion tubes in other related materials, highlighting their broader relevance. Furthermore, our computational experiments indicate that these structures can be directly stabilized and reversibly switched by applied electric fields, establishing a straightforward route for their practical realization and functional control in nanoelectronic devices.

Title: CHIPS-FF: Evaluating Universal Machine Learning Force Fields for Material Properties
Authors: Daniel Wines, Kamal Choudhary
Abstract: In this work, we introduce CHIPS-FF (Computational High-Performance Infrastructure for Predictive Simulation-based Force Fields), a universal, open-source benchmarking platform for machine learning force fields (MLFFs). This platform provides robust evaluation beyond conventional metrics such as energy, focusing on complex properties including elastic constants, phonon spectra, defect formation energies, surface energies, and interfacial and amorphous phase properties. Utilizing 16 graph-based MLFF models including ALIGNN-FF, CHGNet, MatGL, MACE, SevenNet, ORB, MatterSim and OMat24, the CHIPS-FF workflow integrates the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) with JARVIS-Tools to facilitate automated high-throughput simulations. Our framework is tested on a set of 104 materials, including metals, semiconductors and insulators representative of those used in semiconductor components, with each MLFF evaluated for convergence, accuracy, and computational cost. Additionally, we evaluate the force-prediction accuracy of these models for close to 2 million atomic structures. By offering a streamlined, flexible benchmarking infrastructure, CHIPS-FF aims to guide the development and deployment of MLFFs for real-world semiconductor applications, bridging the gap between quantum mechanical simulations and large-scale device modeling.

Title: Planon-modular fracton orders
Authors: Evan Wickenden, Marvin Qi, Arpit Dua, Michael Hermele
Abstract: There are now many examples of gapped fracton models, which are defined by the presence of restricted-mobility excitations above the quantum ground state. However, the theory of fracton orders remains in its early stages, and the complex landscape of examples is far from being mapped out. Here we introduce the class of planon-modular (p-modular) fracton orders, a relatively simple yet still rich class of quantum orders that encompasses several well-known examples of type I fracton order. The defining property is that any non-trivial point-like excitation can be detected by braiding with planons. From this definition, we uncover a significant amount of general structure, including the assignment of a natural number (dubbed the weight) to each excitation of a p-modular fracton order. We identify simple new phase invariants, some of which are based on weight, which can easily be used to compare and distinguish different fracton orders. We also study entanglement renormalization group (RG) flows of p-modular fracton orders, establishing a close connection with foliated RG. We illustrate our general results with an analysis of several exactly solvable fracton models that we show to realize p-modular fracton orders, including Z_n versions of the X-cube, anisotropic, checkerboard, 4-planar X-cube and four color cube (FCC) models. We show that each of these models is p-modular and compute its phase invariants. We also show that each example admits a foliated RG at the level of its non-trivial excitations, which is a new result for the 4-planar X-cube and FCC models. We show that the Z_2 FCC model is not a stack of other better-studied models, but predict that the Z_n FCC model with n odd is a stack of 10 4-planar X-cubes, possibly plus decoupled layers of 2d toric code. We also show that the Z_n checkerboard model for n odd is a stack of three anisotropic models.

Title: Learning by Confusion: The Phase Diagram of the Holstein Model
Authors: George Issa, Owen Bradley, Ehsan Khatami, Richard Scalettar
Abstract: We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.

Title: Role of asymmetry in thermoelectric properties of a double quantum dot out of equilibrium
Authors: Diego Perez Daroca, Pablo Roura-Bas, Armando A. Aligia
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric properties of a double quantum dot system coupled to two metallic reservoirs, focusing on two main effects: (i) the influence of coupling asymmetry between the quantum dot and the reservoirs on the Seebeck coefficient, and (ii) the impact of asymmetry in the energy levels of the dots on current rectification. In the first case, we find that introducing moderate asymmetry significantly enhances the Seebeck coefficient. In the second case, while rectification vanishes when the energy levels are degenerate, substantial rectification is achieved when one energy level lies below and the other above the Fermi level. We further interpret the dependence of rectification magnitude and shape on system parameters using analytical results from a spinless model.

Title: Two- and many-body physics of ultracold molecules dressed by dual microwave fields
Authors: Fulin Deng, Xinyuan Hu, Wei-Jian Jin, Su Yi, Tao Shi
Abstract: We investigate the two- and many-body physics of the ultracold polar molecules dressed by dual microwaves with distinct polarizations. Using Floquet theory and multichannel scattering calculations, we identify a regime with the largest elastic-to-inelastic scattering ratio which is favorable for performing evaporative cooling. Furthermore, we derive and, subsequently, validate an effective interaction potential that accurately captures the dynamics of microwave-shielded polar molecules (MSPMs). We also explore the ground-state properties of the ultracold gases of MSPMs by computing physical quantities such as gas density, condensate fraction, momentum distribution, and second-order correlation. It is shown that the system supports a weakly correlated expanding gas state and a strongly correlated self-bound gas state. Since the dual-microwave scheme introduces addition control knob and is essential for creating ultracold Bose gases of polar molecules, our work pave the way for studying two- and many-body physics of the ultracold polar molecules dressed by dual microwaves.

Title: How quantum selection rules influence the magneto-optical effects of driven, ultrafast magnetization dynamics
Authors: Mohamed F. Elhanoty, Olle Eriksson, Chin Shen Ong, Oscar Grånäs
Abstract: Ultrafast magnetization dynamics driven by ultrashort pump lasers is typically explained by changes in electronic populations and scattering pathways of excited conduction electrons. This conventional approach overlooks the fundamental role of quantum mechanical selection rules, governing transitions from core states to the conduction band, that forms the key method of the probing step in these experiments. By employing fully ab initio time-dependent density functional theory, we reveal that these selection rules profoundly influence the interpretation of ultrafast spin dynamics at specific probe energies. Our analysis for hcp Co and fcc Ni at the M edge demonstrates that the transient dynamics, as revealed in pump-probe experiments, arise from a complex interplay of optical excitations of the M shell. Taking into account the selection rules and conduction electron spin flips, this leads to highly energy-dependent dynamics. These findings address longstanding discrepancies in experimental TMOKE measurements and show that only through meticulous consideration of matrix elements at the probe stage, can one ensure that magnetization dynamics is revealed in its true nature, instead of being muddled by artifacts arising from the choice of probe energy.

Title: Influence of carrier density and disorder on the Quantum Hall plateau widths in epitaxial graphene
Authors: Ignacio Figueruelo-Campanero, Yuriko Baba, Alejandro Jimeno-Pozo, Julia García-Pérez, Elvira M. González, Rodolfo Miranda, Francisco Guinea, Enrique Cánovas, Daniel Granados, Pierre Pantaleón, Pablo Burset, Mariela Menghini
Abstract: Since its discovery, graphene has been one of the most prominent 2D materials due to its unique properties and broad range of possible applications. In particular, the half-integer Quantum Hall Effect (HI-QHE) characterized by the quantization of Hall resistivity as a function of applied magnetic field, offers opportunities for advancements in quantum metrology and the understanding of topological quantum states in this 2D material. While the role of disorder in stabilizing quantum Hall plateaus (QHPs) is widely recognized, the precise interplay between the plateaus width, disorder, mobility and carrier density remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the width of the $\nu=6$ QHP in epitaxial graphene Hall bars, focusing on two distinct regions of the device with markedly different electronic mobilities. Depending on the storage conditions, it is possible to modify the carrier density of graphene QHE devices and consequently increase or reduce the mobility. Our experiments reveal mobility variations of up to 200$\%$ from their initial value. In particular, the sample storage time and ambient conditions cause also noticeable changes in the positions and extension of the QHPs. Our results show that the QHP extension for $\nu=6$ differs significantly between the two regions, influenced by both mobility and disorder, rather than solely by carrier density. Transport simulations based on the Landauer-Büttiker formalism with Anderson disorder in a scaled model reveal the critical role of impurities in shaping graphene transport properties defining the extension of the QHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the interplay between mobility, disorder, and quantum transport in graphene systems.

Title: Signatures of Enhanced Superconducting Properties in Niobium Cavities

Abstract: Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) niobium cavities are critical for modern particle accelerators, as well as for advancing superconducting quantum systems and enabling ultra-sensitive searches for new physics. In this work, we report a systematic observation of an anomalous frequency dip in Nb cavities, which occurs at temperatures just below the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$), indicative of enhanced superconducting properties at $T \ll T_c$. The magnitude of this dip is strongly correlated with the RF surface resistance, impurity distribution near the surface, and $T_\mathrm{c}$. We also present the first demonstration of the coherence peak in the AC conductivity of Nb SRF cavities. By comparing recent theories developed to model this experimental data, we show that the frequency dip feature, larger coherence peak height, and reduction in the temperature-dependent surface resistance with RF current occur at minimal but finite levels of disorder.

Title: Mechanistic insights into Z-ring formation and stability: A Langevin dynamics approach to FtsZ self-assembly
Authors: Rajneesh Kumar, Ramanujam Srinivasan, Debasish Chaudhuri
Abstract: The tubulin-like protein FtsZ is crucial for cytokinesis in bacteria and many archaea, forming a ring-shaped structure called the Z-ring at the site of cell division. Despite extensive research, the self-assembly of Z-rings is not entirely understood. We propose a theoretical model based on FtsZ's known filament structures, treating them as semiflexible polymers with specific mechanical properties and lateral inter-segment attraction that can stabilize ring formations. Our molecular dynamics simulations reveal various morphological phases, including open helices, chains, rings, and globules, capturing experimental observations in the fission yeast model using FtsZ from different bacterial species or mutants of Escherichia coli. Using our theoretical model, we explore how treadmilling activity affects Z-ring stability and identify a spooling mechanism of ring formation. The active ring produces contractile, shear, and rotational stresses, which intensify as the Z-ring transitions to an open helix at high activity.

Title: Emergence of a second law of thermodynamics in isolated quantum systems
Authors: Florian Meier, Tom Rivlin, Tiago Debarba, Jake Xuereb, Marcus Huber, Maximilian P. E. Lock
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. This appears to conflict with the reversible evolution of isolated quantum systems under the Schrödinger equation, which preserves the von Neumann entropy. Nonetheless, one finds that with respect to many observables, expectation values approach a fixed value -- their equilibrium value. This ultimately raises the question: in what sense does the entropy of an isolated quantum system increase over time? For classical systems, one introduces the assumption of a low entropy initial state along with the concept of ignorance about the microscopic details of the physical system, leading to a statistical interpretation of the second law. By considering the observables through which we examine quantum systems, both these assumptions can be incorporated, building upon recent studies of the equilibration on average of observables. While the statistical behavior of observable expectation values is well-established, a quantitative connection to entropy increase has been lacking so far. In deriving novel bounds for the equilibration of observables, and considering the entropy of the system relative to observables, we recover a variant of the second law: the entropy with respect to a given observable tends towards its equilibrium value in the course of the system's unitary evolution. These results also support recent findings which question the necessity of non-integrability for equilibration in quantum systems. We further illustrate our bounds using numerical results from the paradigmatic example of a quantum Ising model on a chain of spins. There, we observe entropy increasing up to equilibrium values, as well as fluctuations which expose the underlying reversible evolution in accordance with the derived bounds.

Title: Mitigating Farmland Biodiversity Loss: A Bio-Economic Model of Land Consolidation and Pesticide Use
Authors: Elia Moretti, Michael Benzaquen
Abstract: Biodiversity loss driven by agricultural intensification is a pressing global issue, with significant implications for ecosystem stability and human well-being. Existing policy instruments have so far proven insufficient in halting this decline, which raises the need to explore the possible feedback loops that are pivotal to ecosystem degradation. We design a minimal integrated bio-economic agent-based model to qualitatively explore macro-level biodiversity trends, as influenced by individual farmer behavior within simple decision-making processes. Our model predicts further biodiversity decline under a business-as-usual scenario, primarily due to intensified land consolidation. We evaluate two policy options: reducing pesticide use and subsidizing small farmers. While pesticide reduction rapidly benefits biodiversity in the beginning, it eventually leads to increased land consolidation and further biodiversity loss. In contrast, subsidizing small farmers by reallocating a small fraction of existing subsidies, stabilizes farm sizes and enhances biodiversity in the long run. The most effective strategy results from combining both policies, leveraging pesticide reduction alongside targeted subsidies to balance economic pressures and consistently improve biodiversity.

Title: High-dimensional learning of narrow neural networks
Authors: Hugo Cui
Abstract: Recent years have been marked with the fast-pace diversification and increasing ubiquity of machine learning applications. Yet, a firm theoretical understanding of the surprising efficiency of neural networks to learn from high-dimensional data still proves largely elusive. In this endeavour, analyses inspired by statistical physics have proven instrumental, enabling the tight asymptotic characterization of the learning of neural networks in high dimensions, for a broad class of solvable models. This manuscript reviews the tools and ideas underlying recent progress in this line of work. We introduce a generic model -- the sequence multi-index model -- which encompasses numerous previously studied models as special instances. This unified framework covers a broad class of machine learning architectures with a finite number of hidden units, including multi-layer perceptrons, autoencoders, attention mechanisms; and tasks, including (un)supervised learning, denoising, contrastive learning, in the limit of large data dimension, and comparably large number of samples. We explicate in full detail the analysis of the learning of sequence multi-index models, using statistical physics techniques such as the replica method and approximate message-passing algorithms. This manuscript thus provides a unified presentation of analyses reported in several previous works, and a detailed overview of central techniques in the field of statistical physics of machine learning. This review should be a useful primer for machine learning theoreticians curious of statistical physics approaches; it should also be of value to statistical physicists interested in the transfer of such ideas to the study of neural networks.

Title: eminus - Pythonic electronic structure theory
Authors: Wanja Timm Schulze, Sebastian Schwalbe, Kai Trepte, Stefanie Gräfe
Abstract: In current electronic structure research endeavors such as warm dense matter or machine learning applications, efficient development necessitates non-monolithic software, providing an extendable and flexible interface. The open-source idea offers the advantage of having a source code base that can be reviewed and modified by the community. However, practical implementations can often diverge significantly from their theoretical counterpart. Leveraging the efforts of recent theoretical formulations and the features of Python, we try to mitigate these problems. We present eminus, an education- and development-friendly electronic structure package designed for convenient and customizable workflows, yet built with intelligible and modular implementations.

Title: Quantum Groups as Global Symmetries II. Coulomb Gas Construction
Authors: Barak Gabai, Victor Gorbenko, Jiaxin Qiao, Bernardo Zan, Aleksandr Zhabin
Abstract: We study a conformal field theory that arises in the infinite-volume limit of a spin chain with $U_q(sl_2)$ global symmetry. Most operators in the theory are defect-ending operators which allows $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetry transformations to act on them in a consistent way. We use Coulomb gas techniques to construct correlation functions and compute all OPE coefficients of the model, as well as to prove that the properties imposed by the quantum group symmetry are indeed satisfied by the correlation functions. In particular, we treat the non-chiral operators present in the theory. Free boson realization elucidates the origin of the defects attached to the operators. We also comment on the role of quantum group in generalized minimal models.

Title: Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Aiichi Iwazaki
Abstract: Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or lower and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz at a low temperature of 35 mK and with a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes, indicating the presence of axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. We also propose additional experiments that support the existence of axions. The appearance of the axion effect in the quantum Hall effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.

Title: Escape-from-a-layer approach for simulating the boundary local time in Euclidean domains
Authors: Yilin Ye, Adrien Chaigneau, Denis S. Grebenkov
Abstract: We propose an efficient numerical approach to simulate the boundary local time of reflected Brownian motion, as well as the time and position of the associated reaction event on a smooth boundary of a Euclidean domain. This approach combines the standard walk-on-spheres algorithm in the bulk with the approximate solution of the escape problem in a boundary layer. In this way, the most time-consuming simulation of multiple reflections on the boundary is replaced by an equivalent escape event. We validate the proposed escape-from-a-layer approach by comparing simulated statistics of the boundary local time with exact results known for simple domains (a disk, a circular annulus, a sphere, a spherical shell) and with the numerical results obtained by a finite-element method in more sophisticated domains. This approach offers a powerful tool for simulating reflected Brownian motion in multi-scale confinements such as porous media or biological environments, and for solving the related partial differential equations. Its applications in the context of diffusion-controlled reactions in chemical physics are discussed.

Title: Quantum Friction near the Instability Threshold
Authors: Daigo Oue, Boris Shapiro, Mário G. Silveirinha
Abstract: In this work, we develop an analytical framework to understand quantum friction across distinct stability regimes, providing approximate expressions for frictional forces both in the deep stable regime and near the critical threshold of instability. Our primary finding is analytical proof that, near the instability threshold, the quantum friction force diverges logarithmically. This result, verified through numerical simulations, sheds light on the behavior of frictional instabilities as the system approaches criticality. Our findings offer new insights into the role of instabilities, critical divergence and temperature in frictional dynamics across quantum and classical regimes.

Title: Hydrodynamics without Boost-Invariance from Kinetic Theory: From Perfect Fluids to Active Flocks
Authors: Kevin T. Grosvenor, Niels A. Obers, Subodh P. Patil
Abstract: We derive the hydrodynamic equations of perfect fluids without boost invariance [1] from kinetic theory. Our approach is to follow the standard derivation of the Vlasov hierarchy based on an a-priori unknown collision functional satisfying certain axiomatic properties consistent with the absence of boost invariance. The kinetic theory treatment allows us to identify various transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic regime. We identify a drift term that effects a relaxation to an equilibrium where detailed balance with the environment with respect to momentum transfer is obtained. We then show how the derivative expansion of the hydrodynamics of flocks can be recovered from boost non-invariant kinetic theory and hydrodynamics. We identify how various coefficients of the former relate to a parameterization of the so-called equation of kinetic state that yields relations between different coefficients, arriving at a symmetry-based understanding as to why certain coefficients in hydrodynamic descriptions of active flocks are naturally of order one, and others, naturally small. When inter-particle forces are expressed in terms of a kinetic theory influence kernel, a coarse-graining scale and resulting derivative expansion emerge in the hydrodynamic limit, allowing us to derive diffusion terms as infrared-relevant operators distilling different parameterizations of microscopic interactions. We conclude by highlighting possible applications.

Title: Extraordinary manifestation of near electrostatic field caused by macroscopic quantum shell effects in submicron hemispherical clusters
Authors: S. E. Kuratov, I. S. Galtsov, S. A. Dyachkov, S. Yu. Igashov
Abstract: The existence of macroscopic shell structure of submicron metal clusters is known for several decades. Since the most studies provide theoretical analysis for clusters of spherical shape, the electron density inhomogeneities caused by shell effects are spherically symmetric and do not provide long range electrostatic fields. However, similar shell structure should exist in a hemispherical cluster which conserves the closed periodic orbits of electrons, but not the spherical symmetry of electron distribution. As a result, we demonstrate that a strong electrostatic field ($E \sim 10^8$~V/m) exists in the vicinity of the flat surface of an isolated, uncharged metal nanocluster of hemispherical shape using modern approaches for electronic structure evaluation. This physical phenomenon is a consequence of the large-scale spatial inhomogeneity in distribution of electrons related to quantum shell effects in submicron metal clusters, which may find numerous applications in various fields of science and technology.
