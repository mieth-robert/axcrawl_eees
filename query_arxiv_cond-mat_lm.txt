Title: Impact of electronic correlations on the superconductivity of high-pressure CeH9
Authors: Siyu Chen, Yao Wei, Bartomeu Monserrat, Jan M. Tomczak, Samuel Poncé
Abstract: Rare-earth superhydrides have attracted considerable attention because of their high critical superconducting temperature under extreme pressures. They are known to have localized valence electrons, implying strong electronic correlations. However, such many-body effects are rarely included in first-principles studies of rare-earth superhydrides because of the complexity of their high-pressure phases. In this work, we use a combined density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory approach to study both electrons and phonons in the prototypical rare-earth superhydride CeH$_9$, shedding light on the impact of electronic correlations on its critical temperature for phonon-mediated superconductivity. Our findings indicate that electronic correlations result in a larger electronic density at the Fermi level, a bigger superconducting gap, and softer vibrational modes associated with hydrogen atoms. Together, the inclusion of these correlation signatures increases the Migdal-Eliashberg superconducting critical temperature from 47 K to 96 K, close to the measured 95 K. Our results reconcile experimental observations and theoretical predictions for CeH$_9$ and herald a path towards the quantitative modeling of phonon-mediated superconductivity for interacting electron systems.

Title: Projective Representations, Bogomolov Multiplier, and Their Applications in Physics
Authors: Ryohei Kobayashi, Haruki Watanabe
Abstract: We present a pedagogical review of projective representations of finite groups and their physical applications in quantum many-body systems. Some of our physical results are new. We begin with a self-contained introduction to projective representations, highlighting the role of group cohomology, representation theory, and classification of irreducible projective representations. We then focus on a special subset of cohomology classes, known as the Bogomolov multiplier, which consists of cocycles that are symmetric on commuting pairs but remain nontrivial in group cohomology. Such cocycles have important physical implications: they characterize (1+1)D SPT phases that cannot be detected by string order parameters and give rise, upon gauging, to distinct gapped phases with completely broken non-invertible $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We construct explicit lattice models for these phases and demonstrate how they are distinguished by the fusion rules of local order parameters. We show that a pair of completely broken $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ SSB phases host nontrivial interface modes at their domain walls. As an example, we construct a lattice model where the ground state degeneracy on a ring increases from 32 without interfaces to 56 with interfaces.

Title: Self-learning Monte Carlo Method: A Review
Authors: Gaopei Pan, Chuang Chen, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: The Self-Learning Monte Carlo (SLMC) method is a Monte Carlo approach that has emerged in recent years by integrating concepts from machine learning with conventional Monte Carlo techniques. Designed to accelerate the numerical study of interacting many-body systems, SLMC significantly improves sampling efficiency by constructing an effective model -- via machine learning methods -- based on configurations generated by conventional Monte Carlo methods and then proposes global updates based on the effective model. This enhancement leads to a substantial reduction in autocorrelation time, especially near the critical region, where traditional methods typically suffer from critical slowing down and increased computation complexity. Moreover, SLMC maintains statistical accuracy by implementing a cumulative update scheme that rigorously satisfies the detailed balance condition. And more recent applications have extended the SLMC to convolutional neural networks with applications not only in condensed matter physics but also high-energy physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum simulations. The generic applicability and high computational efficiency make SLMC a powerful and scalable framework for quantum Monte Carlo simulations of strongly correlated electron systems, extending the reach of numerical investigations beyond the limitations of conventional techniques.

Title: Kinetics of Vacancy-Assisted Reversible Phase Transition in Monolayer MoTe$_2$
Authors: Fei Shuang, Daniel Ocampo, Reza Namakian, Arman Ghasemi, Poulumi Dey, Wei Gao
Abstract: We investigate the kinetics of phase transition between the 2H and 1T$^\prime$ phases in monolayer MoTe$_2$ using atomistic simulations based on a machine learning interatomic potential trained on SCAN-DFT data, combined with mean field kinetic theory to interpret the underlying mechanisms. The transition is found to involve both diffusive and diffusionless mechanisms. Nucleation of 1T$^\prime$ phase is initiated by the coalescence of neighboring Te monovacancies into divacancies, which are found to be mobile and can interact with other Te vacancies to form small triangular 1T$^\prime$ islands. Growth of these islands proceeds either by incorporating pre-existing vacancies at the phase boundaries or, in their absence, by absorbing divacancies that migrate from the surrounding lattice. Once a critical island size is reached, vacancy-free growth becomes possible although with a higher activation barrier. Upon removal of external stimuli, the system reverts to 2H phase, during which Te vacancies reorganize into three-fold spoke-like vacancy lines at the island center. This reverse process and the subsequent 1T$^\prime$$\leftrightarrow$2H reversible transitions are diffusionless, rapid, do not require additional vacancies and can be driven by mild external stimuli. Although our analysis focuses on strain-induced transitions, the kinetic mechanisms are expected to be generalizable to other types of stimuli.

Title: Nonreciprocal magnetic-field-induced second harmonic generation of exciton polaritons in ZnSe
Authors: J. Mund, D. R. Yakovlev, A. Farenbruch, N. V. Siverin, M. A. Semina, M. M. Glazov, E. L. Ivchenko, M. Bayer
Abstract: We report on the optical second harmonic generation (SHG) on the 1S exciton-polariton resonance in bulk ZnSe that is subject to an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the light wave vector $\mathbf k$ (Voigt geometry). For the symmetry allowed geometry with the $\mathbf{k}\parallel[111]$ crystal axes, the nonreciprocal dependence of the SHG intensity on the magnetic field direction is found. It is explained by an interference of the crystallographic and magnetic-field-induced SHG signals. Relative phases of these signals are evaluated from the rotational anisotropy diagrams. Phenomenological and microscopic models of the effect are developed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental observation of the nonreciprocal SHG in semiconductor crystals, and the first one for exciton-polaritons.

Title: Spin Polarization driven by Itinerant Orbital Angular Momentum in van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: Luis M. Canonico, Jose H. García, Aron W. Cummings, Stephan Roche
Abstract: We report on the possibility of manipulating magnetic materials by using itinerant orbital angular momentum to produce out-of-plane spin polarization in van der Waals heterostructures. Employing a real-space formulation of the OAM operator within linear response theory, we demonstrate that in low-symmetry transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers, such as 1$T{}_d$-MoTe2, the current-induced itinerant OAM exceeds the spin response by three orders of magnitude. When TMDs are coupled with ferromagnets with negligible intrinsic orbital responses, the itinerant OAM generated by the orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect transfers across the interface, generating spin densities capable of inducing magnetization dynamics inside the ferromagnet. Our findings highlight the previously overlooked role of itinerant OAM in the generation of out-of-plane spin densities, which serves as an emerging mechanism for efficient electrical control of magnetization in low-power, ultracompact storage devices.

Title: Anisotropic Multi-Q Order in CoxTaS2
Authors: Jonathon Kruppe, Josue Rodriguez, Catherine Xu, James Analytis, Joseph Orenstein, Veronika Sunko
Abstract: The cobalt-intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide Co$_x$TaS$_2$ hosts a rich landscape of magnetic phases that depend sensitively on $x$. While the stoichiometric compound with $x=1/3$ exhibits a single magnetic transition, samples with $x\leq 0.325$ display two transitions with an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) emerging in the lower temperature phase. Here, we resolve the spin structure in each phase by employing a suite of magneto-optical probes that include the discovery of anomalous magneto-birefringence -- a spontaneous time-reversal sensitive rotation of the principal optic axes. A symmetry-based analysis identifies the AHE-active phase as an anisotropic (2+1)\textbf{Q} state, in which magnetic modulation at one wavevector (\textbf{Q}) differs in symmetry from that at the remaining two. The (2+1)\textbf{Q} state naturally exhibits scalar spin chirality as a mechanism for the AHE and expands the classification of multi-Q magnetic phases.

Title: Quenched Disorder in the Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$
Authors: Leshan Zhao, Tong Chen, Matthew B. Stone, Qiang Zhang, Colin L. Sarkis, S. M. Koohpayeh, Collin Broholm
Abstract: We investigate the crystal electric field (CEF) excitations of Yb$^{3+}$ ions in powder samples of the triangular-lattice rare-earth-based antiferromagnet YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ using inelastic neutron scattering (INS). Three CEF excitations from the ground-state Kramers doublet were observed, each exhibiting significant broadening beyond instrumental resolution. Combining temperature-dependent INS and neutron powder diffraction, we identify a significant static contribution to this broadening and attribute it to heterogeneous coordination of Yb$^{3+}$ ions due to Ga$^{3+}$/Zn$^{2+}$ site mixing. Rietveld refinement of neutron powder diffraction indicates that 35% of Ga occupies the Zn site and 60% of Zn occupies the Ga site. We show with a point charge model for the CEF Hamiltonian that heterogeneous coordination of Yb$^{3+}$ ions leads to broadened CEF peaks. First-principles calculations demonstrate that the random Ga$^{3+}$/Zn$^{2+}$ distribution can produce the distortions of the YbO$_6$ octahedra observed from neutron diffraction. Because the documented heterogeneity will extend to exchange interactions, our results suggest that disorder is a significant factor in the unusual magnetism previously reported in YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$, including broad low-energy magnetic excitations and the absence of magnetic ordering down to 0.3K.

Title: Defect Interactions Through Periodic Boundaries in Two-Dimensional $p$-atics
Authors: Cody D. Schimming
Abstract: Periodic boundary conditions are a common tool used to emulate effectively infinite domains. However, two-dimensional periodic domains are topologically distinct from the infinite plane, eliciting the question: How do periodic boundaries affect systems with topological properties themselves? In this work, I derive an analytical expression for the orientation fields of two-dimensional $p$-atic liquid crystals, systems with $p$-fold rotational symmetry, with topological defects in a flat domain subject to periodic boundary conditions in two-dimensions. I show that this orientation field leads to an anomalous interaction between defects that deviates from the usual Coulomb interaction, which is confirmed through continuum simulations of nematic liquid crystals ($p = 2$). The interaction is understood as being mediated by non-singular topological solitons in the director field which are stabilized by the periodic boundary conditions. The results show the importance of considering domain topology, not only geometry, when analyzing interactions between topological defects.

Title: Suppression of Thermal Conductivity via Singlet-Dominated Scattering in TmFeO$_3$
Authors: M. L. McLanahan, D. Lederman, A. P. Ramirez
Abstract: We measured the thermal conductivity of the rare-earth orthoferrites, $R$FeO$_3$, where $R$ = Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Yb and see an anomalous strong suppression for TmFeO$_3$. Using a Debye thermal transport model, we demonstrate that this suppression is due to resonant scattering between phonons and the Tm$^{3+}$ $4f$ singlet crystal field levels. The implications of these results are discussed in context of thermal conductivity studies in quantum magnets.

Title: Low-energy domain wall racetracks with multiferroic topologies

Abstract: Conventional racetrack memories move information by pushing magnetic domain walls or other spin textures with spin-polarized currents, but the accompanying Joule heating inflates their energy budget and can hamper scaling. Here we present a voltage-controlled, magnetoelectric racetrack in which transverse electric fields translate coupled ferroelectric-antiferromagnetic walls along BiFeO3 nanostrips at room temperature. Because no charge traverses the track, the switching dissipates orders of magnitude less energy than the most efficient spin-torque devices with more favourable scaling, making the scheme significantly more attractive at the nanoscale. We further uncover noncollinear topological magnetoelectric textures that emerge at domain walls in BiFeO3, where the nature of these topologies influences their stability upon translation. Among these are polar bi-merons and polar vertices magnetoelectrically coupled with magnetic cycloid disclinations and previously unobserved, topological magnetic cycloid twist topologies. We observe domain wall velocities of at least kilometres per second - matching or surpassing the fastest ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic racetracks and approaching the acoustic-phonon limit of BiFeO3 - while preserving these topologies over tens of micrometres. The resulting high velocity, low-energy racetrack delivers nanosecond access times without the thermal overhead of current-driven schemes, charting a path toward dense, ultralow-power racetrack devices which rely on spin texture translation.

Title: Spin relaxation in a polariton fluid: quantum hydrodynamic approach
Authors: D. A. Saltykova, A. V. Yulin, I. A. Shelykh
Abstract: Cavity polaritons, the elementary excitations appearing in quantum microcavities in the strong-coupling regime, reveal clear signatures of quantum collective behavior. The combination of unique spin structure and strong nonlinear response opens the possibility of direct experimental observation of a plethora of nontrivial optical polarization phenomena. Spin relaxation processes are of crucial importance here. However, a mathematical formalism for their coherent description is still absent. In the present paper, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach for a two-component liquid, we derive the set of the corresponding equations where both energy and spin relaxation terms appear naturally. We analyze in detail how these terms affect the dynamics of spinor polariton droplets in the external magnetic field and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of spinor bosonic condensates, where the processes of spin relaxation play a major role.

Title: Enhancement of Indistinguishable Photon Emission from a GaAs Quantum Dot via Charge Noise Suppression
Authors: Priyabrata Mudi, Avijit Barua, Kartik Gaur, Steffen Wilksen, Alexander Steinhoff, Setthanat Wijitpatima, Sarthak Tripathi, Julian Ritzmann, Andreas D. Wieck, Sven Rodt, Christopher Gies, Arne Ludwig, Stephan Reitzenstein
Abstract: The generation of indistinguishable single photons is a fundamental requirement for future quantum technologies, particularly in quantum repeater networks and for distributed quantum computing based on entanglement distribution. However, spectral jitter, often induced by charge noise in epitaxial quantum dots, leads to exciton dephasing, thereby limiting their practical usage in quantum applications. We present a straightforward approach to mitigate charge noise-induced decoherence in droplet-etched GaAs quantum dots embedded in an n-i-p diode structure and integrated deterministically into an electrically contacted circular Bragg grating resonator for emission enhancement. The quantum device allows for the stabilization of the charge environment by applying an external electrical field while producing a photon extraction efficiency of approximately (37 +- 2)%. Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon interference measurements reveal a strong voltage dependence of the exciton dephasing time and interference visibility on the applied bias in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions. Notably, the reduction in visibility from a maximum, charge-stabilized corrected value of 97 percent at the optimum bias point follows an inverse square dependence (proportional to 1/I^2) with increasing diode current (I) in forward direction. Under a quasi-resonant excitation scheme, we achieve a maximum exciton dephasing time (T2*) of approximately (6.8 +-0.5) ns, reaching nearly the Fourier limit (T2 = 2T1) without the need for complex echo schemes like Ramsey or Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequences. These findings are consistent with theoretical predictions from rate equation modeling and quantum optical analysis as well as voltage-dependent linewidth measurements, demonstrating optimized electrical control of exciton dephasing.

Title: Walking on Archimedean Lattices: Insights from Bloch Band Theory
Authors: Davidson Noby Joseph, Igor Boettcher
Abstract: Returning walks on a lattice are sequences of moves that start at a given lattice site and return to the same site after $n$ steps. Determining the total number of returning walks of a given length $n$ is a typical graph-theoretical problem with connections to lattice models in statistical and condensed matter physics. We derive analytical expressions for the returning walk numbers on the eleven two-dimensional Archimedean lattices by developing a connection to the theory of Bloch energy bands. We benchmark our results through an alternative method that relies on computing the moments of adjacency matrices of large graphs, whose construction we explain explicitly. As a condensed matter physics application, we use our formulas to compute the density of states of tight-binding models on the Archimedean lattices. While the Archimedean lattices provide a sufficiently rich structure and are chosen here for concreteness, our techniques can be generalized straightforwardly to other two- or higher-dimensional Euclidean lattices.

Title: A Physics-Informed Data-Driven Discovery for Constitutive Modeling of Compressible, Nonlinear, History-Dependent Soft Materials under Multiaxial Cyclic Loading
Authors: Alireza Ostadrahimi, Amir Teimouri, Kshitiz Upadhyay, Guoqiang Li
Abstract: We propose a general hybrid physics-informed machine learning framework for modeling nonlinear, history-dependent viscoelastic behavior under multiaxial cyclic loading. The approach is built on a generalized internal state variable-based visco-hyperelastic constitutive formulation, where stress is decomposed into volumetric, isochoric hyperelastic, and isochoric viscoelastic components. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models the equilibrium response, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units capture time-dependent viscoelastic effects. Physical constraints, including objectivity, material symmetry, and thermodynamic consistency, are enforced to ensure physically valid predictions. After developing the general form of the surrogate model based on tensor integrity bases and response functions, we employed the nonlinear Holzapfel differential viscoelastic model to generate training data. Two datasets, one for short-term and another for long-term relaxation, are constructed to span a wide range of material memory characteristics. The model is trained and tested under diverse multiaxial loading conditions, including different stretch levels applied independently in the longitudinal and transverse directions, varying strain rates, and both tension and compression states, even beyond the training domain. Energy dissipation is explicitly analyzed at different strain rates for both datasets to verify thermodynamic consistency through the second law. The results show that the proposed framework accurately captures complex, nonlinear, and rate-dependent material responses. Moreover, it demonstrates strong robustness to synthetic noise, enabling generalizable and physically consistent predictions under realistic and variable loading scenarios.

Title: Extreme Thermal Insulation in Nano-Bubble Wrap Materials
Authors: Amalya C. Johnson, Sorren Warkander, Archana Raja, Fang Liu
Abstract: Achieving ultra-low thermal conductivity under ambient conditions is a fundamental challenge constrained by classical heat transport limits and material design trade-offs. Here, we introduce a new class of nano-bubble wrap architectures that achieve exceptionally low thermal conductivity by integrating nanoscale gas confinement with atomically thin, weakly coupled van der Waals solids. Using scalable patterning of 2D monolayers into periodic nano-bubbles and nano-wrinkles, we construct materials with structural analogies to macroscopic bubble wrap but engineered at length scales much shorter than the mean free path of air and the mean free path of phonons in the atomically thin monolayers. Time-domain thermoreflectance measurements reveal out-of-plane thermal conductivities nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of air and commercial aerogels, reaching critical values below 0.001 W $\cdot$ M$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ under room temperature and atmospheric pressure. This extreme thermal resistance arises from the combined suppression of gas-phase conduction, phonon transport, and interfacial coupling. Our findings establish nano-bubble wraps as a versatile platform for tuning heat flow in ultrathin materials and open new pathways for designing thermal metamaterials and energy-efficient technologies.

Title: Stress Softening Damage in Strongly Nonlinear Viscoelastic Soft Materials A Physics Informed Data Driven Constitutive Model with Time Temperature Coupling
Authors: Alireza Ostadrahimi, Amir Teimouri, Kshitiz Upadhyay, Guoqiang Li
Abstract: This study presents a novel physics informed, data-driven modeling framework for capturing the strongly nonlinear thermo-viscoelastic behavior of soft materials exhibiting stress softening, with emphasis on the Mullins effect. Unlike previous approaches limited to quasi-static or isothermal conditions, our model unifies rate dependence, temperature sensitivity, large strain cyclic loading, and evolving damage mechanisms. Thermodynamic admissibility is ensured via a custom loss function that embeds the Clausius Duhem inequality and explicitly constrains the damage variable for physically realistic softening. A Temporal Convolutional Network is trained on high fidelity experimental data across multiple temperatures, strain rates, and stretch levels, enabling the model to capture rich thermomechanical coupling and history dependence. The framework generalizes to unseen thermo mechanical conditions, higher strain rates, and larger deformations, and remains robust to input noise. Validation against finite element simulations using Abaqus/Explicit demonstrates excellent agreement under cyclic loading and damage evolution, confirming the surrogate models effectiveness for advanced simulation workflows.

Title: Scalable tensor network algorithm for quantum impurity problems
Authors: Zhijie Sun, Ruofan Chen, Zhenyu Li, Chu Guo
Abstract: The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method has shown great potential as a general-purpose quantum impurity solver, as its numerical errors can be well-controlled and it is flexible to be applied on both the imaginary- and real-time axis. However, a major limitation of it is that its computational cost grows exponentially with the number of impurity flavors. In this work, we propose a multi-flavor extension of it to overcome this limitation. The key insight is that to calculate multi-time correlation functions on one or a few impurity flavors, one could integrate out the degrees of freedom of the rest flavors before hand, which could greatly simplify the calculation. The idea is particularly effective for quantum impurity problems with diagonal hybridization function, i.e., each impurity flavor is coupled to an independent bath, a setting which is commonly used in the field. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method for the imaginary time evolution of impurity problems with up to three impurity orbitals, i.e., 6 flavors, and benchmark our results against continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Our method paves the way of scaling up tensor network algorithms to solve large-scale quantum impurity problems.

Title: Collinear Antiferromagnetic Tunnel Junctions Implemented in Van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: Wei-Min Zhao, Yi-Lun Liu, Liu Yang, Cheng Tan, Yuanjun Yang, Zhifeng Zhu, Meixia Chen, Tingting Yan, Rong Hu, James Partridge, Guopeng Wang, Mingliang Tian, Ding-Fu Shao, Lan Wang
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are crucial components in high-performance spintronic devices. Traditional MTJs rely on ferromagnetic (FM) materials but significant improvements in speed and packing density could be enabled by exploiting antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds instead. Here, we report all-collinear AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) fabricated with van der Waals A-type AFM metal (Fe0.6Co0.4)5GeTe2 (FCGT) electrodes and nonmagnetic semiconducting WSe2 tunnel barriers. The AFMTJ heterostructure device achieves a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of up to 75% in response to magnetic field switching. Our results demonstrate that the TMR exclusively emerges in the AFM state of FCGT, rather than during the AFM-to-FM transition. By engineering FCGT electrodes with either even- or odd-layer configurations, volatile or non-volatile TMR could be selected, consistent with an entirely interfacial effect. TMR in the even-layer devices arose by Néel vector switching. In the odd-layer devices, TMR stemmed from interfacial spin-flipping. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal a new TMR mechanism associated with interface-driven spin-polarized transport, despite the spin-independent nature of bulk FCGT. Our work demonstrates that all-collinear AFMTJs can provide comparable performance to conventional MTJs and introduces a new paradigm for AFM spintronics, in which the spin-dependent properties of AFM interfaces are harnessed.

Title: Hyperuniformity near jamming transition over a wide range of bidispersity
Authors: Duc T. Dam, Takeshi Kawasaki, Atsushi Ikeda, Kunimasa Miyazaki
Abstract: We numerically investigate hyperuniformity in two-dimensional frictionless jammed packings of bidisperse systems. Hyperuniformity is characterized by the suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales, and the structure factor asymptotically vanishes in the small-wavenumber limit as $S(q) \propto q^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha > 0$. It is well known that jammed configurations exhibit hyperuniformity over a wide range of wavenumbers windows, down to $q^{\ast}\sigma \approx 0.2$, where $\sigma$ is the particle diameter. In two dimensions, we find that the exponent $\alpha$ is approximately $0.6\text{--}0.7$. This contrasts with the reported value of $\alpha = 1$ for three-dimensional systems. We employ an advanced method recently introduced by Rissone \textit{et al.} \href{this https URL}{[Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 127}, 038001 (2021)]}, originally developed for monodisperse and three-dimensional systems, to determine $\alpha$ with high precision. This exponent is found to be unchanged for all size ratios between small and large particles, except in the monodisperse case, where the system crystallizes.

Title: Probing nontrivial fusion of Majorana zero modes via near-adiabatic coupling
Authors: Jing Bai, Luting Xu, Wei Feng, Xin-Qi Li
Abstract: We propose and simulate a near-adiabatically coupling probing scheme for nontrivial fusion of a pair of Majorara zero modes (MZMs). The scheme can avoid the complexity of oscillating charge occupation in the probing quantum dot, making thus practical measurements more feasible. We also show how to extract the information of nonadiabatic transition and fermion parity violation caused during moving the MZMs together to fuse, from the initial states prepared with definite fermion parity. All the simulations, including the effective coupling between the fusing MZMs, and their coupling to the probing quantum dot, are based on the lattice model of a Rashba quantum wire in proximity contact with an s-wave superconductor, under the modulation of mini-gate voltage control.

Title: Cryogenic magnetization dynamics in tensile-strained ultrathin yttrium iron garnets with tunable magnetic anisotropy
Authors: Jihyung Kim, Dongchang Kim, Seung-Gi Lee, Yung-Cheng Li, Jae-Chun Jeon, Jiho Yoon, Sachio Komori, Ryotaro Arkakwa, Tomoyasu Taniyama, Stuart S. P. Parkin, Kun-Rok Jeon
Abstract: We report a significant reduction of low-temperature damping losses in tensile-strained, ultrathin Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) films grown by pulsed laser deposition, exhibiting ultralow damping constants and tunable magnetic anisotropy. Comparative broadband FMR measurements show that tensile-strained YIG films on Gd3Sc2Ga3O12 (GSGG) retain low damping even at nanometer thicknesses and cryogenic temperatures, outperforming relaxed films on Gd3Ga5O12. Based on static magnetometry measurements and microstructural characterization, we attribute these enhanced dynamic properties to the suppression of interdiffusion across the YIG/GSGG interface, resulting from enhanced chemical stability and favorable growth kinetics by the presence of Sc. Our findings highlight the importance of chemical and kinetic factors in achieving few-nanometer-thick YIG film with negligible low-temperature damping dissipation and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for cryogenic spintronic applications.

Title: Spin-reorientation Driven Temperature Dependent Intrinsic Anomalous Hall Conductivity in Fe$_3$Ge, a Ferromagnetic Topological Metal
Authors: Susanta Ghosh, Tushar Kanti Bhowmik, Achintya Low, Setti Thirupathaiah
Abstract: We investigate the temperature dependence of the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity in Fe$_3$Ge, which is a ferromagnetic topological metal. We observe a significant anisotropy in the anomalous Hall conductivity between in-plane and out-of-plane directions. We further identify that the total Hall conductivity is contributed extrinsically due to the skew-scattering mechanism and intrinsically due to nonzero Berry curvature in the momentum space. Most importantly, we demonstrate the temperature dependence of the intrinsic Hall contribution, a rare phenomenon to visualize experimentally, due to tuning the easy-magnetic axis from the out-of-plane to the in-plane with decreasing temperature. We also show that the extrinsic Hall conductivity decreases with temperature as $\sigma_{xy}^{ext}(T)=\frac{\sigma_{xy0}^{ext}}{(aT+1)^2}$ due to electron-phonon scattering.

Title: Three-dimensional spinless Euler insulators with rotational symmetry
Authors: Manabu Sato, Shingo Kobayashi, Motoaki Hirayama, Akira Furusaki
Abstract: The Euler class is a $\mathbb{Z}$-valued topological invariant that characterizes a pair of real bands in a two-dimensional Brillouin zone. One of the symmetries that permits its definition is $C_{2z}T$, where $C_{2z}$ denotes a twofold rotation about the $z$ axis and $T$ denotes time-reversal symmetry. Here, we study three-dimensional spinless insulators characterized by the Euler class, focusing on the case where additional $C_{4z}$ or $C_{6z}$ rotational symmetry is present, and investigate the relationship between the Euler class of the occupied bands and their rotation eigenvalues. We first consider two-dimensional systems and clarify the transformation rules for the real Berry connection and curvature under point group operations, using the corresponding sewing matrices. Applying these rules to $C_{4z}$ and $C_{6z}$ operations, we obtain explicit formulas that relate the Euler class to the rotation eigenvalues at high-symmetry points. We then extend our analysis to three-dimensional systems, focusing on the difference in the Euler class between the two $C_{2z}T$-invariant planes. We derive analytic expressions that relate the difference in the Euler class to two types of representation-protected invariants and analyze their phase transitions. We further construct tight-binding models and perform numerical calculations to support our analysis and elucidate the bulk-boundary correspondence.

Title: Structure determination of flat honeycomb Bi grown on Ag(111)
Authors: Ziyong Zhang, Xiaobin Chen, Takeshi Nakagawa
Abstract: Honeycomb bismuthene structures on Ag(111) were investigated using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and density functional theory. LEED I(V) analysis revealed that 0.5 monolayer (ML) of Bi forms an ultraflat honeycomb lattice with negligible buckling at ~120 K, which transforms into other structures upon warming to room temperature. A similar flat bismuthene structure also forms in Mn/Bi/Ag(111), which remains stable even at room temperature. Mn deposition on $(p\times \sqrt{3})$-rect Bi/Ag(111) induces Bi surface segregation, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, resulting in a p$(2\times2)$ honeycomb bismuthene. The detailed structural investigation provides fundamental insights into the characterization of two-dimensional topological properties of bismuthene grown on Ag(111).

Title: Coulomb-mediated single-electron heat transfer statistics across capacitively coupled silicon nanodots
Authors: Kensaku Chida, Antoine Andrieux, Katsuhiko Nishiguchi
Abstract: Heat transfer mediated by the Coulomb interaction reveals unconventional thermodynamic behavior and broadens thermodynamics research into fields such as quantum dynamics and information engineering. Although some experimental demonstrations of phenomena utilizing Coulomb-mediated heat transfer have been reported, estimations of their performance, such as efficiency, and their theoretical evaluations necessitate qualitative evaluation of the transfer mechanism itself, which remains challenging. We present an experiment investigating single-electron dynamics in two electrostatically coupled silicon nanodots to quantify Coulomb-mediated heat transfer at the nanoscale. By estimating the Coulomb interaction strength between the dots using the cross-correlation measurements of the single-electron dynamics, we convert the single-electron dynamics into the statistics of Coulomb-mediated heat transfer. Conducting the experiment at equilibrium enabled us to obtain a fluctuating net-zero heat transfer between the dots. These heat transfer statistics are essential for exploring device functionalities from the perspective of stochastic thermodynamics and for verifying universal relations in nonequilibrium states.

Title: Spontaneous Rotation of a Symmetric Inclusion in Chiral Active Bath
Authors: Abhra Puitandy, Shradha Mishra
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a circular passive inclusion, termed a torquer, in a bath of chiral active Brownian particles. Despite being geometrically symmetric and non-motile, the torquer exhibits persistent rotation due to spatially inhomogeneous torques arising from angularly biased collisions with active particles. This interaction-driven symmetry breaking does not rely on shape anisotropy or external forcing. Through simulations, we identify two distinct regimes of rotation: one dominated by density gradients at low chirality, and another by increased impact frequency at high chirality. Our results highlight how nonequilibrium interactions in chiral active media can induce motion in symmetric objects, offering a new perspective on symmetry breaking in active systems.

Title: Quantum Mechanical Approach for Modeling of Ternary Based Strained-Layer Superlattice
Authors: Arash Dehzangi, Jiakai Li
Abstract: Ternary-based InAs/InAs1-xSbx Strained-Layer Superlattice (SLS)material with type-II band alignment belongs to the 6.1 A family with reasonably small lattice mismatch with GaSb substrate for epitaxial growth. InAs/InAs1-xSbx SLS have been proven to have more advantages such as longer carrier lifetime, better control on growth and manufacturability, and being considered as an alternative material system for infrared photodetectors. In this article a quantum mechanical based modelling on electronic band structure of InAs/InAs1-xSbx is presented. A modified sp3s* empirical tight binding method along with implementing a virtual crystal approximation with a bowing of the s-on-site tight-binding energy, were incorporated. In this approach, a theoretical explanation of atomic segregation in superlattices is suggested and used in calculations. The simulations show good agreement with experimentally measured band gap of InAs/InAs1-xSbx superlattices.

Title: Quantum geometrical bound relations for observables
Authors: Koki Shinada, Naoto Nagaosa
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) provides nontrivial bound relations among physical quantities, as exemplified by the metric-curvature inequality. In this paper, we investigate various bound relations for different observables through certain generalizations of the QGT. First, by generalizing the parameter space, we demonstrate that bound relations hold for all linear responses. As an application, we show the thermodynamic inequality originating from the convexity of free energy can be further tightened. Second, by extending the projection operator, we establish a bound relation between the Drude weight and the orbital magnetization. The equality is exactly satisfied in the Landau level system, and systems with nearly flat bands tend to approach equality as well. We apply the resulting inequality to two orbital ferromagnets and support that the twisted bilayer graphene system is close to the Landau level system. Moreover, we show that an analogous inequality also holds for a higher-order multipole, magnetic quadrupole. Finally, we discuss the analogy between the QGT and the uncertainty principle, emphasizing that the existence of nontrivial bound relations necessarily reflects quantum effects.

Title: Enhancement of Josephson Supercurrent and $π$-Junction by Chiral Antiferromagnetism
Authors: Jin-Xing Hou, Hai-Peng Sun, Björn Trauzettel, Song-Bo Zhang
Abstract: Magnetic order typically disrupts superconductivity, reducing the supercurrent. Here, we show that chiral antiferromagnetism, with non-relativistic spin-split bands and distinctive valley-locked spin texture, can instead significantly enhance Josephson supercurrents. This enhancement stems from the emergence of dominant equal-spin triplet pairing and strong fluctuations of singlet pairing in momentum space, both induced by chiral antiferromagnetism. We demonstrate these results in Josephson junctions composed of chiral antiferromagnetic metals and conventional superconductors on kagome lattices. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced Josephson supercurrent is stabilized in a $\pi$-junction state. These phenomena persist across a broad energy range and remain stable for different temperatures and junction lengths. Our results unveil a previously unexplored mechanism for enhancing supercurrent by strong magnetic order and provide crucial insights into the large Josephson currents observed in Mn$_3$Ge.

Title: Energy Dynamics of a Nonequilibrium Unitary Fermi Gas
Authors: Xiangchuan Yan, Jing Min, Dali Sun, Shi-Guo Peng, Xin Xie, Xizhi Wu, Kaijun Jiang
Abstract: We investigate the energy dynamics of a unitary Fermi gas driven away from equilibrium. The energy is injected into the system by periodically modulating the trapping potential of a spherical unitary Fermi gas, and due to the existence of SO(2,1) symmetry, the breathing mode is excited without dissipation. Through the long-lived breathing oscillation, we precisely measure the energy evolution of the nonequilibrium system during the trap modulation. We find the trapping potential and internal energies increase with modulation time and simultaneously oscillate nearly $\textrm{180}^{\textrm{o}}$ out of phase. At large modulation amplitudes, the energy-injection efficiency is strongly reduced due to the trap anharmonicity. Unlike the equilibrium system, the measured energy evolution agrees well with predictions of the dynamic virial theorem. Our work provides valuable insights into the energy injection and redistribution in a non-equilibrium system, paving a way for future investigations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

Title: Magnetoelectric multiferroics: from fundamentals to transformative applications -- a mini review
Authors: Michał Wanic
Abstract: Multiferroics, combining ferroelectric and magnetic orders, enable magnetoelectric (ME) coupling for advanced applications. This mini review explores single-phase and composite multiferroics, examining phenomenological, microscopic, nanostruc-tured, and quantum mechanisms driving ME effects. Phenomenological models quantify coupling coefficients, while microscopic approaches reveal spin-lattice in-teractions, including frustrated spin states and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya contributions. Nanostructured systems, such as plasmonic skyrmion lattices and metasurfaces, en-hance ME effects for tunable birefringence and electromagnon amplification. Quan-tum heat engines utilize spin entanglement and topological protection in chiral chains and skyrmion lattices for efficient energy conversion. Applications include high-sensitivity magnetic sensors, tunable radio-frequency devices, energy-efficient MERAM, energy harvesters, quantum heat engines, and thermal diodes. Future re-search aims to optimize room-temperature ME coupling, scalability, coherence, and biocompatibility for innovations in sensing, quantum computing, and sustainable energy.

Title: Chemical vapor deposition synthesis of (GeTe)n(Sb2Te3) gradient crystalline films as promising planar heterostructures
Authors: M. Zhezhu, A. Vasil'ev, M. Yapryntsev, E. Ghalumyan, D.A. Ghazaryan, H. Gharagulyan
Abstract: Phase-change materials of the (GeTe)n (Sb2Te3) (GST) system are of high relevance in memory storage and energy conversion applications due to their fast-switching speed, high data retention, and tunable properties. Here, we report on a fast and efficient CVD-based method for the fabrication of crystalline GST films with variable Ge/Sb atomic content. In particular, the approach enables compositional control without changing the precursor, facilitating a gradient synthesis of Ge3Sb2Te6, Ge2Sb2Te5, and GeSb2Te4 phases in a single attempt. The analyses of their structural, optical, and electrical aspects highlight how compositional variation influences the film's properties. Our findings demonstrate a straightforward approach enabling the preparation of gradient crystalline GST films with tunable morphology and functionality. These gradient films can potentially provide in-plane multilevel and gradual switching thresholds for memory applications and altered refractive index and absorption for optical modulation and filtering applications.

Title: Banding and polarization in driven multistable materials
Authors: Sheng Huang, Daniel Hexner
Abstract: We study a disordered network of bistable bonds subjected to periodic strain. The model is inspired by experiments on crumpled sheets and it features behaviors associated with glasses, including a complex energy landscape, memories, and large avalanches. At small strain amplitudes, the system quickly converges to a limit cycle where the system repeatedly cycles between a set of states. At large amplitudes, motion is erratic and does not converge to a limit cycle. The transition appears to be continuous, with diverging time scales. The nature of instabilities is different on both sides of the transition. At small strain amplitudes, instabilities are correlated only over a finite distance. Above the transition, instabilities are localized along diagonal bands. The distance between bands grows near the transition and appears to diverge. We propose a simple model that explains these observations. Below the transition, we propose a new ``order parameter'' -- the polarization of the instabilities along the driving direction.

Title: Machine learning many-body potentials for charged colloids in primitive 1:1 electrolytes
Authors: Thijs ter Rele, Gerardo Campos-Villalobos, René van Roij, Marjolein Dijkstra
Abstract: Effective interactions between charged particles dispersed in an electrolyte are most commonly modeled using the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) potential, where the ions in the suspension are coarse-grained out at mean-field level. However, several experiments point to shortcomings of this theory, as the distribution of ions surrounding colloids is governed by nontrivial correlations in regimes of strong Coulomb coupling (e.g. low temperature, low dielectric constant, high ion valency, high surface charge). Insight can be gained by explicitly including the ions in simulations of these colloidal suspensions, even though direct simulations of dispersions of highly charged spheres are computationally demanding. To circumvent slow equilibration, we employ a machine-learning (ML) framework to generate ML potentials that accurately describe the effective colloid interactions. These ML potentials enable fast simulations and make large-scale simulations of charged colloids in suspension possible, opening the possibility for a systematic study of their phase behaviour, in particular gas-liquid and fluid-solid coexistence.

Title: Disorder-induced spin excitation continuum and spin-glass ground state in the inverse spinel CuGa$_2$O$_4$

Abstract: Spinel-structured compounds serve as prototypical examples of highly frustrated systems, and are promising candidates for realizing the long-sought quantum spin liquid (QSL) state. However, structural disorder is inevitable in many real QSL candidates and its impact remains a topic of intense debate. In this work, we conduct comprehensive investigations on CuGa$_2$O$_4$, a spinel compound with significant structural disorder, focusing on its thermodynamic properties and spectroscopic behaviors. No long-range magnetic order is observed down to $\sim$80 mK, as evidenced by magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and elastic neutron scattering measurements. More intriguingly, inelastic neutron scattering experiments reveal a broad gapless continuum of magnetic excitations around the Brillouin zone boundary, resembling the magnetic excitation spectra expected for a QSL. Nevertheless, a spin-freezing transition at $T_{\rm{f}} \approx $ 0.88 K is identified from the cusp in the dc susceptibility curves, where a bifurcation between zero-field-cooling and field-cooling curves occurs. Furthermore, ac susceptibility measurements show a peak close to $T_{\rm{f}}$ at low frequency, which shifts to higher temperature with increasing frequency. These results are evident that CuGa$_2$O$_4$ has spin-glass ground state, consistent with the establishment of short-range order inferred from the specific heat measurements. Collectively, these results illustrate the crucial role of disorder in defining the excitation spectrum out of the disordered ground state. Our findings shed light onto the broader class of AB$_2$O$_4$ spinels and advance our understanding of the spin dynamics in magnetically disordered systems.

Title: Weyl nodes in CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ studied by dynamical mean-field theory
Authors: Jorūnas Dobilas, Martin Brass, Frank T. Ebel, Silke Pasche, Karsten Held
Abstract: The heavy fermion compound CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ has recently shown to exhibit a spontaneous nonlinear Hall effect, indicating its topological nature. This is consistent with the lack of inversion symmetry that allows for the existence of Weyl nodes. Here, we employ density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory, which is state-of-the-art for such correlated materials, and study the topology of CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$. We find five inequivalent Weyl nodes of either type I or II, each having sixteen symmetry-related replicas. These Weyl nodes bridge the Kondo insulating gap, which is a direct but not an indirect gap. The closest Weyl points is only 0.5meV below the Fermi energy, and has a flat energy-momentum dispersion

Title: Magnetic Triple-q State in Antiferromagnetic Monolayer Interfaced with Bismuthene
Authors: Chia-Ju Chen, Yu-Tung Lin, Chieh-Lin Lee, Nitin Kumar, Hung-Chin Lee, Yen-Hui Lin, Bo-Yao Wang, Stefan Bluegel, Gustav Bihlmayer, Pin-Jui Hsu
Abstract: We have successfully fabricated the bismuthene covered Mn monolayer on Ag(111) by evaporating Mn atoms onto (pxroot3)-Bi/Ag(111) at room temperature. By using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM), we have resolved the magnetic triple-q (3Q) state. In combination with density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the 3Q3-like spin texture is the magnetic ground state for the bismuthene covered Mn monolayer/Ag(111). Interestingly, the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of 3Q3 state triggered by the bismuthene on top of Mn monolayer/Ag(111) has been revealed, which is consistent with the switching of 3Q3up and 3Q3down domains observed by SP-STM measurements with external magnetic fields.

Title: Laser-Induced Topological Toggle Switching at Room Temperature in the van der Waals Ferromagnet \ce{Fe3GaTe2}
Authors: Charlie W. F. Freeman, Woohyun Cho, Paul S. Keatley, PeiYu Cai, Elton J. G. Santos, Robert J. Hicken, H. Yang, Hidekazu Kurebayashi, Murat Cubukcu, Maciej Dabrowski
Abstract: We demonstrate room-temperature nucleation and manipulation of topological spin textures in the van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet, Fe3GaTe2, through laser pulse excitation. By leveraging laser-induced heating and subsequent cooling, we access the skyrmion/bubble state at low fields and achieve toggle switching between two topological spin textures - skyrmion/bubble and labyrinth. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that this switching behaviour arises from laser-induced heating and cooling. Our findings highlight the potential of vdW ferromagnets for room temperature laser-controlled non-volatile memory storage applications.

Title: Harmonic generation of graphene quantum dots in Hartree-Fock approximation
Authors: Kainan Chang, Ying Song, Yuwei Shan, Jin Luo Cheng
Abstract: We theoretically investigate harmonic generation in graphene quantum dots under linearly polarized optical pulses, focusing on excitonic effects. Combining the tight-binding model and the single-particle density matrix approach, we derive a semiconductor Bloch equation under a static-screened Hartree-Fock approximation. This framework characterizes the electron-electron interaction through local Hartree potentials for direct Coulomb interaction and nonlocal Fock potentials for exchange interaction. Distinct confgurations of Hartree and Fock terms yield various approximation methods, including independent-particle approximation, mean-feld approximation, random phase approximation, and excitonic effects. We thoroughly analyze how these approximation methods affect the electronic energy levels, linear optical absorption, and nonlinear harmonic generation. Within excitonic effects, we present the dependence of harmonic generation on the geometric variations of graphene quantum dots (sizes, triangular/hexagonal shapes, and armchair/zigzag edges) and the amplitude and polarization of electric fields. Our findings show that excitonic effects significantly enhance optical responses of graphene nanostructures. For a dot ensemble formed by randomly oriented graphene quantum dots, only odd-order harmonics exist along the polarization direction of the incident light. Crucially, harmonic generation in graphene quantum dots exhibits high tunability via geometric configuration, making them promising candidates for nonlinear optical nanodevices.

Title: Enhanced Phonon-Assisted Tunneling in Metal -- Twisted Bilayer Graphene Junctions
Authors: Radhika Soni, Suvronil Datta, Robin Bajaj, Saisab Bhowmik, Shinjan Mandal, Baladitya Suri, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Manish Jain, U. Chandni
Abstract: We report planar tunneling spectroscopy measurements on metal-WSe$_2$-twisted bilayer graphene heterostructures across a broad range of gate and bias voltages. The observed experimental features are attributed to phonon-assisted tunneling and the significantly high density of states within the moiré bands. A notable finding is the enhanced phonon-assisted tunneling in twisted bilayer graphene compared to Bernal bilayer graphene, which arises from a more relaxed in-plane momentum matching criterion. Theoretical calculations of phonon dispersions enable us to identify low-energy phonon modes in both Bernal and twisted bilayers of graphene, thereby elucidating the underlying mechanism of tunneling. Our results establish planar tunneling as a versatile tool to further understand electron-phonon coupling in twisted van der Waals materials.

Title: Mapping diverse hysteresis dynamics in scaled MoS$_2$ FETs using the universal method derived from TCAD modeling
Authors: Yezhu Lv, Haihui Cai, Yehao Wu, Yu.Yu. Illarionov
Abstract: Field-effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials have already reached the stage of trial FAB integration. However, reliability limitations caused by various defects present a serious obstacle for their smooth way forward, especially when scaling the device geometries. Still the ongoing research is mostly focused on pure technology aspects, while reliability is often recalled only when showing a randomly measured gate transfer curve to manifest that the hysteresis is "negligible".In fact the hysteresis dynamics contain unique fingerprints of various mechanisms which may coexist or cancel each other, being more complex in scaled FETs, for instance because of simultaneous interaction of defects with the channel and top gate in thin insulators. To fill this gap, here by doing TCAD modeling for nanoscale MoS$_2$/HfO$_2$ FETs we introduce the universal hysteresis mapping method which can correctly capture commonly measured diverse hysteresis dynamics such as conventional clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) hysteresis, as well as CW/CCW switching and time separation. Next we extend this method to bias-temperature instabilities (BTI) and show a clear correlation between complex hysteresis dynamics and abnormal BTI recovery. Finally, we validate our mapping method using available experimental data for MoS$_2$ FETs and demonstrate that it provides far more accurate results than a conventional constant current extraction of the hysteresis width, being also usable if a CCW hysteresis is caused by mobile ions.

Title: History-dependent and frequency-dependent dielectric nonlinearities induced by polar nanoregions in a thin film of 0.5 ( Ba 0.7 Ca 0.3 TiO 3 ) -- 0.5 ( BaZr 0.2 Ti 0.8 O 3 )
Authors: Kevin Nadaud (GREMAN), Guillaume Nataf (GREMAN), Nazir Jaber (GREMAN), Edgar Chaslin (GREMAN), Béatrice Negulescu (GREMAN), Jérôme Wolfman (GREMAN, CNRS)
Abstract: In this article, dielectric nonlinearities in 0.5(Ba0.7 Ca0.3 TiO3 ) -- 0.5(BaZr 0.2 Ti0.8 O3 ) thin film are studied using impedance spectroscopy and harmonic measurements, as a function of the AC measuring field, at different frequencies and upon cycling. The measurements reveal that the pinching of the hysteresis loop, characterized by a phase angle of the third harmonic close to --270 deg, is stronger for low frequencies. This confirms that the pinching is induced by the presence of polar nanoregions (PNRs), whose responses are also strongly dependent on frequency. When repeating the measurement, the PNR contribution changes since the phase angle of the third-harmonic response evolves from pinched to conventional relaxor. This shows that strong changes in the PNR configuration can be induced, even for low AC fields. First-order reversal curves (FORCs) confirm the presence of a pinched hysteresis loop. When repeating the FORC measurement a second time, the distribution drastically changes and corresponds to a soft ferroelectric. The asymmetry of the Preisach plane measured using FORCs is confirmed by a proposed measurement strategy: unipolar impedance measurements.

Title: Ultrafast thermal boundary conductance under large temperature discontinuities of ultrathin epitaxial Pb films on Si(111)
Authors: Christian Brand, Tobias Witte, Mohammad Tajik, Jonas D. Fortmann, Birk Finke, Michael Horn-von Hoegen
Abstract: Heat transfer is a critical aspect of modern electronics, and a deeper understanding of the underlying physics is essential for building faster, smaller, and more powerful devices with an improved performance and efficiency. In such nanoscale structures the heat transfer between two materials is limited by the finite thermal boundary conductance across their interface. Using ultrafast electron diffraction under grazing incidence we investigated the heat transfer from ultrathin epitaxial Pb films to an Si(111) substrate under strong non-equilibrium conditions. Applying an intense femtosecond laser pulse, the 5-7 ML thin Pb film experiences a strong heat up by 10-120 K while the Si substrate remains cold at $\approx$ 10 K. At such large temperature discontinuities we observe a significantly faster cooling for stronger excited Pb films. The decrease of the corresponding cooling time constant is explained through the thermal boundary conductance in the framework of the diffuse mismatch model. The thermal boundary conductance is reduced by more than a factor of three in comparison with Pb films grown on H-terminated substrates, pointing out the importance of the morphology of substrate, film and their interface.

Title: Comparative Study of Strain-Engineered Thermoelectric Performance of 2D-Xene Nanoribbons
Authors: Kalpana Panneerselvam, Swastik Sahoo, Bhaskaran Muralidharan
Abstract: The quest for efficient and scalable thermoelectric materials has catalyzed intense interest in quasi 1D nanoribbons, where reduced dimensionality and structural tunability can decouple key transport parameters to enhance energy conversion. In this work, we present a unified comparative study of the thermopower in armchair nanoribbons derived from five archetypal 2D materials: graphene, silicene, germanene, stanene and phosphorene. Using a tight binding model parametrized by first principles inputs and solved within the Landauer Buttiker formalism, we compute strain and width dependent thermopower across nanoribbons classified by width families (3p, 3p+1, 3p+2) over a wide range of uniaxial tensile strain. Our results reveal that thermoelectric behavior is governed by a complex interplay of bandgap evolution, chemical potential asymmetry, and quantum confinement. While graphene and silicene exhibit pronounced family and width sensitive thermopower enhancement under moderate strain, heavier Xenes such as germanene and stanene show diminished responses. In particular, phosphorene nanoribbons emerge as exceptional, exhibiting remarkably high thermopower (62 kB/e), a consequence of their large, persistent bandgap and anisotropic electronic structure. Across all systems, the 3p+2 family transitions from near-metallic to semiconducting under strain, enabling dramatic activation of thermopower in previously inactive configurations. This systematic cross material analysis delineates the design principles for the optimization of TE in 1D nanoribbons, highlighting the strategic use of width control and strain engineering. Our findings identify phosphorene as an intrinsically superior thermoelectric material and position strained Xene nanoribbons as promising candidates for tunable, low-dimensional thermoelectric devices.

Title: Designing binary mixtures of colloidal particles with simple interactions that assemble complex crystals
Authors: Beth Hsiao-Yen Wei, C. Levi Petix, Qizan Chen, Michael P. Howard, Jeetain Mittal
Abstract: Computational methods for designing interactions between colloidal particles that induce self-assembly have received much attention for their promise to discover tailored materials. However, it often remains a challenge to translate computationally designed interactions to experiments because they may have features that are too complex, or even infeasible, to physically realize. Toward bridging this gap, we leverage relative-entropy minimization to design pair potentials for binary mixtures of colloidal particles that assemble crystal superlattices. We reduce the dimensionality and extent of the interaction design space by enforcing constraints on the form and parametrization of the pair potentials that are physically motivated by DNA-functionalized nanoparticles. We show that several two- and three-dimensional lattices, including honeycomb and cubic diamond, can be assembled using simple interactions despite their complex structures. We also find that the initial conditions used for the designed parameters as well as the assembly protocol play important roles in determining the outcome and success of the assembly process.

Title: Origin of circular and triangular pores in electron-irradiated hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Umair Javed, Manuel Langle, Vladimir Zobac, Alexander Markevich, Clara Kofler, Martin Paul, Clemens Mangler, Toma Susi, Jani Kotakoski
Abstract: For nearly two decades, it has been known that electron irradiation of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in a transmission electron microscope leads to the formation of triangular pores. This has been attributed to the lower displacement threshold energy of boron, with or without the assistance of an inelastic scattering event, typically assuming that chemical etching caused by residual gases can be neglected. In this study, in contrast to previous high-vacuum experiments, we show that electron irradiation in ultra-high vacuum leads to circular pores, whereas even small amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere during the experiment change the pores into triangles. Ab initio calculations show that oxygen atoms preferentially attach to boron at the pore edge, supporting the hypothesis that they are preferentially etched during irradiation, resulting in nitrogen-terminated triangular defects. Our results explain the origin of triangular pores in hBN and demonstrate a deterministic way to create atomically-defined pores into 2D materials.

Title: From the up-converting multimodal luminescent thermometer to ratiometric visual power density meter based on Er3+,Yb3+ emission
Authors: Anam Javaid, Maja Szymczak, Lukasz Marciniak
Abstract: This study demonstrates that thermally induced variations in the spectroscopic properties of Na3Sc2(PO4)3:Er3+, Yb3+ can be effectively harnessed for multimodal remote temperature sensing. As shown, Na3Sc2(PO4)3:Er3+, Yb3+ supports multiple ratiometric sensing modes based on the intensity ratios of (i) 2H11/2 -> 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 -> 4I15/2; (ii) 2H9/2 -> 4I13/2 and 4S3/2 -> 4I15/2; and (iii) green-to-red emission intensity ratio, achieving maximum relative sensitivities of 2.8% K-1, 3% K-1, and 1.8% K-1, respectively. The synergy between thermal changes observed in the green-to-red emission intensity ratio of Er3+ ions, combined with the efficient optical heating of Na3Sc2(PO4)3:Er3+, Yb3+ at elevated Yb3+ concentrations enables the development of a visual optical power density sensor, exhibiting relative sensitivities of SRx = 1.0% W-1 cm2 and SRy = 0.9% W-1 cm2 at 15 W cm-2 when quantified using CIE 1931 chromaticity coordinates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a visual luminescent optical power density sensor. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Na3Sc2(PO4)3:Er3+, Yb3+ can be successfully applied for two-dimensional imaging of optical power density, thereby enabling spatial visualization of power distribution within an illuminated field.

Abstract: High entropy alloys (HEAs) are a new class of metals that exhibit unique mechanical performance. Among HEAs, additively manufactured eutectic high entropy alloys (AM-EHEAs) have recently emerged as candidate materials for use in extreme conditions due to their simultaneous high strength and ductility. However, the deformation and structural evolution of AM-EHEAs under conditions of high pressure have not been well characterized, limiting their use in extreme applications. We present dynamic compression experiments and molecular dynamics simulations studying the structural evolution of AM-EHEA AlCoCrFeNi2.1 when compressed to pressures up to 400 GPa. Our in-situ X-ray diffraction measurements capture the appearance of fcc and bcc phases at different pressure conditions, with pure- and mixed-phase regions. Understanding the phase stability and structural evolution of the AM EHEA offers new insights to guide the development of high-performance complex materials for extreme conditions.

Title: Preferential site ordering alters the magnetic structure of Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13-x}$Ge$_x$ ($x = 0$-2)
Authors: Jacob W. Fritsky, Hui-Fei Zhai, Yifeng Zhao, Aryan Rauniyar, Antia S. Botana, Jason F. Khoury
Abstract: An important aspect of materials research is the ability to tune different physical properties through controlled alloying. The Ln$_3$M$_4$X$_{13}$ (Ln = Lanthanide, M = Transition Metal, X = Tetrel) filled skutterudite family is of interest due to the tunability of its constituent components and their effects on physical properties, such as superconductivity and complex magnetism. In this work, Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13-x}$Ge$_x$ (x = 0 -- 2) was synthesized via excess Sn-flux and characterized using powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, magnetometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and heat capacity. Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13}$ and its Ge-solid-solution members crystallize in the Pm-3n space group, which has two unique Wyckoff positions for the tetrel (X) site. In the solid solution members, Ge shows preferential occupancy for one of the two Wyckoff sites, reaching $\sim$60$\%$ and 100$\%$ occupancy when x = 1 and 2, respectively. Magnetometry and heat capacity measurements of Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13}$ indicated antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N$ = 7.3 K. However, Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{12}$Ge and Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{11}$Ge$_2$ showed notably lower-temperature antiferromagnetic phase transitions with substantial peak-broadening at $T_N$ = 5.5 K and 4.1 K, respectively. These data suggest that alloying Ge into Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13}$ causes magnetic frustration within the structure, likely attributable to a change in the density of states from additional Ge $p$ states at the Fermi level. This work demonstrates that preferentially alloying Ge in Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13-x}$Ge$_x$ allows for more precise tunability of its magnetic structure, elucidating design principles for different quantum phases in intermetallic materials.

Title: The carbon cost of materials discovery: Can machine learning really accelerate the discovery of new photovoltaics?
Authors: Matthew Walker, Keith T. Butler
Abstract: Computational screening has become a powerful complement to experimental efforts in the discovery of high-performance photovoltaic (PV) materials. Most workflows rely on density functional theory (DFT) to estimate electronic and optical properties relevant to solar energy conversion. Although more efficient than laboratory-based methods, DFT calculations still entail substantial computational and environmental costs. Machine learning (ML) models have recently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in resource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we reproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency limit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates. By quantifying the CO$_2$ emissions associated with each computational strategy, we evaluate the trade-offs between predictive efficacy and environmental cost. Our results reveal multiple hybrid ML/DFT strategies that optimize different points along the accuracy--emissions front. We find that direct prediction of scalar quantities, such as maximum efficiency, is significantly more tractable than using predicted absorption spectra as an intermediate step. Interestingly, ML models trained on DFT data can outperform DFT workflows using alternative exchange--correlation functionals in screening applications, highlighting the consistency and utility of data-driven approaches. We also assess strategies to improve ML-driven screening through expanded datasets and improved model architectures tailored to PV-relevant features. This work provides a quantitative framework for building low-emission, high-throughput discovery pipelines.

Title: Impact of particle-size polydispersity on the quality of thin-film colloidal crystals
Authors: Mariam Arif, Andrew B. Schofield, Fraser H. J. Laidlaw, Wilson C. K. Poon, Job H. J. Thijssen
Abstract: Size polydispersity in colloidal particles can disrupt order in their self-assembly, ultimately leading to a complete suppression of crystallization. In contrast to various computational studies, few experimental studies systematically address the effects of size polydispersity on the quality of colloidal crystals. We present an experimental study of structural order in thin films of crystals vertically dried from colloidal dispersions with a systematically varying polydispersity. As expected, an increase in polydispersity leads to a deterioration in order with significant drops in the local bond-orientational order at 8% and 12% polydispersity. Our results align with previously suggested models of epitaxial-like growth of 2D layers during convective assembly. Our results can offer critical insights into the permissible limits for achieving colloidal crystals from more polydisperse systems such as those synthesized through more sustainable methods.

Title: Partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem from statistical mechanics and chaotic mapping
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora, Marco Cedeno
Abstract: We introduce a partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem (which is the prototype of undecidable problems in combinatorics and statistical physics) by constructing a suitable mapping from tilings of finite squares of different sizes. Such mapping depends on the initial family of Wang tiles (the alphabet) with which one would like to tile the plane. This allows to define effective entropy and temperature associated to the alphabet (together with the corresponding partition function). We identify a subclass of good alphabets by observing that when the entropy and temperature of a given alphabet are well-behaved in the thermodynamical sense then such alphabet can tile the infinite two-dimensional plane. Our proposal is tested successfully with the known available good alphabets (which produce periodic tilings, aperiodic but self-similar tilings as well as tilings which are neither periodic nor self-similar). Our analysis shows that the Kendall Tau coefficient is able to distinguish alphabets with a good thermodynamical behavior from alphabets with bad thermodynamical behavior. The transition from good to undecidable behavior is related to a transition from non-chaotic to chaotic regime in discrete dynamical systems of logistic type.

Title: Improving photovoltaics by adding extra terminals to extract hot carriers
Authors: Bruno Bertin-Johannet, Thibaut Thuégaz, Janine Splettstoesser, Robert S. Whitney
Abstract: Photovoltaic cells usually have two terminals, one collecting electrons and the other collecting holes. Can more terminals improve such solar cells? Energy-filtering terminals could collect "hot" carriers (electrons or holes not yet relaxed to the band edge), with other terminals for low-energy carriers. For collection faster than carrier-phonon relaxation, we predict four-terminal cells with higher power output than optimal two-terminal cells -- more than 40% higher for fast carrier collection. Similar effects will occur in multi-terminal thermoelectrics exploiting non-equilibrium distributions

Title: Suppression of the charge fluctuations by nonlocal correlations close to the Mott transition
Authors: Irakli Titvinidze, Julian Stobbe, Marvin Leusch, Georg Rohringer
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of nonlocal correlations on charge fluctuations in the two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model close to the Mott metal-to-insulator transition. At half-filling and for interaction strengths and temperatures where the system is in the Mott insulating phase, charge fluctuations are strongly suppressed. Under these conditions, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations predict a strong enhancement of the charge susceptibility at small (electron or hole) doping. However, these DMFT results include only the effects of purely local correlations despite the importance of nonlocal correlations in two-dimensional systems. We have, hence, carried out dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A) simulations which allow for the inclusion of such nonlocal correlation effects while retaining the local ones of DMFT. Our numerical data show that close to half-filling the large uniform charge susceptibility of DMFT is strongly suppressed by nonlocal fluctuations but gradually increases with (electron) doping. At a certain doping value charge fluctuations become eventually larger in D$\Gamma$A with respect to DMFT indicating that the absence of nonlocal correlations underestimates the mobility of the charge carriers in this parameter regime. This metallization effect is also reflected in an enhancement of the D$\Gamma$A kinetic and potential energies and a corresponding reduction of the (absolute value of the) D$\Gamma$A Matsubara self-energy with respect to DMFT.

Title: Artificial Intelligence for Quantum Matter: Finding a Needle in a Haystack
Authors: Khachatur Nazaryan, Filippo Gaggioli, Yi Teng, Liang Fu
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have great potential in solving the ground state of various many-body problems. However, several key challenges remain to be overcome before NNs can tackle problems and system sizes inaccessible with more established tools. Here, we present a general and efficient method for learning the NN representation of an arbitrary many-body complex wave function. Having reached overlaps as large as $99.9\%$ for as many as $25$ particles, we employ our neural wave function for pre-training to effortlessly solve the fractional quantum Hall problem for $20$ electrons with Coulomb interactions and realistic Landau-level mixing.

Title: Expansion creates spin-glass order in finite-connectivity models: a rigorous and intuitive approach from the theory of LDPC codes
Authors: Benedikt Placke, Grace M. Sommers, Nikolas P. Breuckmann, Tibor Rakovszky, Vedika Khemani
Abstract: Complex free-energy landscapes with many local minima separated by large barriers are believed to underlie glassy behavior across diverse physical systems. This is the heuristic picture associated with replica symmetry breaking (RSB) in spin glasses, but RSB has only been rigorously verified for certain mean-field models with all-to-all connectivity. In this work, we give a rigorous proof of finite temperature spin glass order for a family of models with local interactions on finite-connectivity, non-Euclidean expander graphs. To this end, we bypass the RSB formalism entirely, and instead exploit the mathematical equivalence of such models to certain low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. We use code expansion, a property of LDPC codes which guarantees extensive energy barriers around ground states. Together with mild additional assumptions, this allows us to construct an explicit decomposition of the low-temperature Gibbs state into disjoint components, each hosting an asymptotically long-lived state associated with a local minimum of the landscape. Each component carries at most an exponentially small fraction of the total weight, and almost all components do not contain ground states -- which we take together to define spin-glass order. The proof is elementary, and treats various expanding graph topologies on the same footing, including those with short loops where existing approaches such as the cavity method fail. Our results apply rigorously to diluted p-spin glasses for sufficiently large p, and while unproven, we also expect our assumptions to hold in a broader family of codes. Motivated by this, we numerically study two simple models, on random regular graphs and a regular tesselation of hyperbolic space. We show that both models undergo two transitions as a function of temperature, corresponding to the onset of weak ergodicity breaking and spin glass order, respectively.

Title: Effective field theory for superfluid vortex lattice from coset construction
Authors: Aleksander Głódkowski, Sergej Moroz, Francisco Peña-Benítez, Piotr Surówka
Abstract: Guided by symmetry principles, we construct an effective field theory that captures the long-wavelength dynamics of two-dimensional vortex crystals observed in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a harmonic potential. By embedding the system into Newton--Cartan spacetime and analyzing its isometries, we identify the appropriate spacetime symmetry group for trapped condensates at finite angular momentum. After introducing a coarse-grained description of the vortex lattice we consider a homogeneous equilibrium configuration and discuss the associated symmetry breaking pattern. We apply the coset construction method to identify covariant structures that enter the effective action and discuss the physical interpretation of the inverse Higgs constraints. We verify that Kohn's theorem is satisfied within our construction and subsequently focus on the gapless sector of the theory. In this regime, the effective theory accommodates a single gapless excitation--the Tkachenko mode--for which we construct both the leading-order and next-to-leading-order actions, the latter including cubic interaction terms.

Title: Interacting Hosts with Microbiome Exchange: An Extension of Metacommunity Theory for Discrete Interactions
Authors: Michael Johnson, Mason A. Porter
Abstract: Microbiomes, which are collections of interacting microbes in an environment, often substantially impact the environmental patches or living hosts that they occupy. In microbiome models, it is important to consider both the local dynamics within an environment and exchanges of microbiomes between environments. One way to incorporate these and other interactions across multiple scales is to employ metacommunity theory. Metacommunity models commonly assume continuous microbiome dispersal between the environments in which local microbiome dynamics occur. Under this assumption, a single parameter between each pair of environments controls the dispersal rate between those environments. This metacommunity framework is well-suited to abiotic environmental patches, but it fails to capture an essential aspect of the microbiomes of living hosts, which generally do not interact continuously with each other. Instead, living hosts interact with each other in discrete time intervals. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework that encodes such discrete interactions and uses two parameters to separately control the interaction frequencies between hosts and the amount of microbiome exchange during each interaction. We derive analytical approximations of models in our framework in three parameter regimes and prove that they are accurate in those regimes. We compare these approximations to numerical simulations for an illustrative model. We demonstrate that both parameters in our modeling framework are necessary to determine microbiome dynamics. Key features of the dynamics, such as microbiome convergence across hosts, depend sensitively on the interplay between interaction frequency and strength.

Title: Multi-loop spectra in general scalar EFTs and CFTs
Authors: Johan Henriksson, Franz Herzog, Stefanos R. Kousvos, Jasper Roosmale Nepveu
Abstract: We consider the most general effective field theory (EFT) Lagrangian with scalar fields and derivatives, and renormalise it to substantially higher loop order than existing results in the literature. EFT Lagrangians have phenomenological applications, for example by encoding corrections to the Standard Model from unknown new physics. At the same time, scalar EFTs capture the spectrum of Wilson--Fisher conformal field theories (CFTs) in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. Our results are enabled by a more efficient version of the $R^*$ method for renormalisation, in which the IR divergences are subtracted via a small-momentum asymptotic expansion. In particular, we renormalise the most general set of composite operators up to engineering dimension six and Lorentz rank two. We exhibit direct applications of our results to Ising ($Z_2$), $O(n)$, and hypercubic ($S_n \ltimes (Z_2)^n$) CFTs, relevant for a plethora of real-world critical phenomena, and we perform a detailed comparison between perturbative and non-perturbative predictions. Our results expand the understanding of generic EFTs and open new possibilities in diverse fields, such as the numerical conformal bootstrap.

Title: Spacetime duality between sequential and measurement-feedback circuits
Authors: Tsung-Cheng Lu, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Yizhi You
Abstract: Two prevalent approaches for preparing long-range entangled quantum states are (i) linear-depth sequential unitary (SU) circuits, which apply local unitary gates sequentially, and (ii) constant-depth measurement-feedback (MF) circuits, which employ mid-circuit measurements and conditional feedback based on measurement outcomes. Here, we establish that a broad class of SU and MF circuits are dual to each other under a spacetime rotation. We investigate this spacetime duality in the preparation of various long-range entangled states, including GHZ states, topologically ordered states, and fractal symmetry-breaking states. As an illustration, applying a spacetime rotation to a linear-depth SU circuit that implements a non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality, originally used to prepare a 1D GHZ state, yields a constant-depth MF circuit that implements a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gauging map, which equivalently prepares the GHZ state. Leveraging this duality, we further propose experimental protocols that require only a constant number of qubits to measure unconventional properties of 1D many-body states. These include (i) measurement of disorder operators, which diagnose the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and (ii) postselection-free detection of measurement-induced long-range order, which emerges in certain symmetry-protected topological phases. We also show that measurement-induced long-range order provides a lower bound for strange correlators, which may be of independent interest.

Title: Higher Structures on Boundary Conformal Manifolds: Higher Berry Phase and Boundary Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Yichul Choi, Hyunsoo Ha, Dongyeob Kim, Yuya Kusuki, Shuhei Ohyama, Shinsei Ryu
Abstract: We introduce the notion of higher Berry connection and curvature in the space of conformal boundary conditions in (1+1)d conformal field theories (CFT), related to each other by exactly marginal boundary deformations, forming a "boundary conformal manifold." Our definition builds upon previous works on tensor networks, such as matrix product states (MPS), where the triple inner product or multi-wavefunction overlap plays the key geometric role. On the one hand, our boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) formulation of higher Berry phase provides a new analytic tool to study families of invertible phases in condensed matter systems. On the other hand, it uncovers a new geometric structure on the moduli space of conformal boundary conditions, beyond the usual Riemannian structure defined through the Zamolodchikov metric. When the boundary conformal manifold has an interpretation as the position moduli space of a D-brane, our higher Berry connection coincides with the NS-NS $B$-field in string theory. The general definition does not require such an interpretation and is formulated purely field-theoretically, in terms of correlation functions of boundary-condition-changing (bcc) operators. We also explore a connection between higher Berry connections and functional Berry connections in the loop spaces of boundary conformal manifolds.

Title: Emergence of Generic Entanglement Structure in Doped Matchgate Circuits
Authors: Alessio Paviglianiti, Luca Lumia, Emanuele Tirrito, Alessandro Silva, Mario Collura, Xhek Turkeshi, Guglielmo Lami
Abstract: Free fermionic Gaussian, a.k.a. matchgate, random circuits exhibit atypical behavior compared to generic interacting systems. They produce anomalously slow entanglement growth, characterized by diffusive scaling $S(t) \sim \sqrt{t}$, and evolve into volume-law entangled states at late times, $S \sim N$, which are highly unstable to measurements. Here, we investigate how doping such circuits with non-Gaussian resources (gates) restores entanglement structures of typical dynamics. We demonstrate that ballistic entanglement growth $S(t) \sim t$ is recovered after injecting an extensive total amount of non-Gaussian gates, also restoring Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations. When the evolution is perturbed with measurements, we uncover a measurement-induced phase transition between an area-law and a power-law entangled phase, $S \sim N^\alpha$, with $\alpha$ controlled by the doping. A genuine volume-law entangled phase is recovered only when non-Gaussian gates are injected at an extensive rate. Our findings bridge the dynamics of free and interacting fermionic systems, identifying non-Gaussianity as a key resource driving the emergence of non-integrable behavior.

Title: Space of conformal boundary conditions from the view of higher Berry phase: Flow of Berry curvature in parametrized BCFTs
Authors: Xueda Wen
Abstract: In this work, we study the connection between two subjects: the space of conformal boundary conditions in boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and the space of gapped systems characterized by higher Berry phases. We explore this connection by analyzing multi-parameter spectral flow in Dirac fermion BCFTs with continuously parametrized conformal boundary conditions, which are introduced by coupling a CFT to a family of gapped systems. When the gapped systems belong to a nontrivial higher Berry class, the associated conformal boundary conditions induce a flow of the ordinary Berry curvature, resulting in a Chern number pump in the Fock space of the BCFT. This phenomenon is the BCFT analog of Berry curvature flow in one-dimensional parametrized gapped systems, where the flow occurs in real space. Building on this correspondence, we introduce the notions of higher Berry curvature and higher Berry invariants within the BCFT framework. Our results provide a new perspective for studying the topological properties of families of conformal boundary states and gapped ground states: if a family of gapped states belongs to a nontrivial higher Berry class, then the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonians exhibit a multi-parameter spectral flow that carries Berry curvature in the Fock space.

Title: The Impact of Social Attractiveness on Casual Group Formation: Power-Law Group Sizes and Suppressed Percolation
Authors: Matheus S. Mariano, José F. Fontanari
Abstract: The dynamics of casual group formation has long been a subject of interest in social sciences. While early stochastic models offered foundational insights into group size distributions, they often simplified individual behaviors and lacked mechanisms for heterogeneous social appeal. Here, we re-examine the attractiveness-driven interaction model, an agent-based framework where point-like agents move randomly in a 2D arena and exhibit varied social appeal, leading them to pause near highly attractive celebrity peers. We compare this model to a null model where the agents are continuously in movement, which resembles a Random Geometric Graph. Our extensive simulations reveal significant structural and dynamic differences: unlike the null model, the attractiveness-driven model's average degree increases linearly with system size for fixed density, resulting in more compact groups and the suppression of a percolation transition. Crucially, while the null model's group size distribution is either exponentially decaying or bimodal, the attractiveness-driven model robustly exhibits a power-law distribution, $P(n) \propto n^{-2.5}$, with an exponent independent of density. These findings, obtained through computationally intensive simulations due to long equilibration times, offer a thorough quantitative characterization of this model, highlighting the critical role of individual attractiveness in shaping social aggregation in physical space.

Title: Efficient Qudit Circuit for Quench Dynamics of $2+1$D Quantum Link Electrodynamics
Authors: Rohan Joshi, Michael Meth, Jan C. Louw, Jesse J. Osborne, Kevin Mato, Martin Ringbauer, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: A major challenge in the burgeoning field of quantum simulation for high-energy physics is the realization of scalable $2+1$D lattice gauge theories on state-of-the-art quantum hardware, which is an essential step towards the overarching goal of probing $3+1$D quantum chromodynamics on a quantum computer. Despite great progress, current experimental implementations of $2+1$D lattice gauge theories are mostly restricted to relatively small system sizes and two-level representations of the gauge and electric fields. Here, we propose a resource-efficient method for quantum simulating $2+1$D spin-$S$ $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theories with dynamical matter using qudit-based quantum processors. By integrating out the matter fields through Gauss's law, we reformulate the quantum link model in a purely spin picture compatible with qudit encoding across arbitrary spatial dimensions, eliminating the need for ancillary qubits and reducing resource overhead. Focusing first on the spin-$1/2$ case, we construct explicit circuits for the full Hamiltonian and demonstrate through numerical simulations that the first-order Trotterized circuits accurately capture the quench dynamics even in the presence of realistic noise levels. Additionally, we introduce a general method for constructing coupling-term circuits for higher-spin representations $S>1/2$. Compared to conventional qubit encodings, our framework significantly reduces the number of quantum resources and gate count. Our approach significantly enhances scalability and fidelity for probing nonequilibrium phenomena in higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories, and is readily amenable to implementation on state-of-the-art qudit platforms.

Title: TinyDEM: Minimal open granular DEM code with sliding, rolling and twisting friction
Authors: Roman Vetter
Abstract: This article introduces TinyDEM, a lightweight implementation of a full-fledged discrete element method (DEM) solver in 3D. Newton's damped equations of motion are solved explicitly for translations and rotations of a polydisperse ensemble of dry, soft, granular spherical particles, using quaternions to represent their orientation in space without gimbal lock. Particle collisions are modeled as inelastic and frictional, including full exchange of torque. With a general particle-mesh collision routine, complex rigid geometries can be simulated. TinyDEM is designed to be a compact standalone program written in simple C++11, devoid of explicit pointer arithmetics and advanced concepts such as manual memory management or polymorphism. It is parallelized with OpenMP and published freely under the 3-clause BSD license. TinyDEM can serve as an entry point into classical DEM simulations or as a foundation for more complex models of particle dynamics.

Title: Probing Hadron Scattering in Lattice Gauge Theories on Qudit Quantum Computers
Authors: Rohan Joshi, Jan C. Louw, Michael Meth, Jesse J. Osborne, Kevin Mato, Guo-Xian Su, Martin Ringbauer, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: An overarching goal in the flourishing field of quantum simulation for high-energy physics is the first-principles study of the microscopic dynamics of scattering processes on a quantum computer. Currently, this is hampered by small system sizes and a restriction to two-level representations of the gauge fields in state-of-the-art quantum simulators. Here, we propose efficient experimentally feasible digital qudit quantum circuits for far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theory, where the electric and gauge fields are represented as spin-$1$ operators. Using dedicated numerical simulations, we probe scattering processes in this model on these proposed circuits, focusing on meson-meson and meson-antimeson collisions. The latter are not possible with a two-level representation of the fields, highlighting the suitability of qudits in exploring scattering processes relevant to quantum electrodynamics. The probed scattering dynamics showcases rich physics, including meson flipping and a reflection-transmission transition in meson-antimeson collisions as a function of the gauge coupling strength. Our simulations, which include realistic noise models of dephasing and depolarization, show very good agreement with the exact noiseless dynamics, signaling the readiness of current qudit platforms to observe microscopic scattering dynamics with significantly shallower circuit depths than their qubit counterparts.

Title: Geometric Theory of Ising Machines
Authors: Andrew G. Moore, Zachary Richey, Isaac K. Martin
Abstract: We contribute to the mathematical theory of the design of low temperature Ising machines, a type of experimental probabilistic computing device implementing the Ising model. Encoding the output of a function in the ground state of a physical system allows efficient and distributed computation, but the design of the energy function is a difficult puzzle. We introduce a diagrammatic device that allows us to visualize the decision boundaries for Ising circuits. It is then used to prove two results: (1) Ising circuits are a generalization of 1-NN classifiers with a certain special structure, and (2) Elimination of local minima in the energy landscape can be formulated as a linear programming problem.

Title: Robustness of Magic in the quantum Ising chain via Quantum Monte Carlo tomography
Authors: Hari Timsina, Yi-Ming Ding, Emanuele Tirrito, Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Bin-Bin Mao, Mario Collura, Zheng Yan, Marcello Dalmonte
Abstract: We study the behavior of magic as a bipartite correlation in the quantum Ising chain across its quantum phase transition, and at finite temperature. In order to quantify the magic of partitions rigorously, we formulate a hybrid scheme that combines stochastic sampling of reduced density matrices via quantum Monte Carlo, with state-of-the-art estimators for the robustness of magic - a {\it bona fide} measure of magic for mixed states. This allows us to compute the mutual robustness of magic for partitions up to 8 sites, embedded into a much larger system. We show how mutual robustness is directly related to critical behaviors: at the critical point, it displays a power law decay as a function of the distance between partitions, whose exponent is related to the partition size. Once finite temperature is included, mutual magic retains its low temperature value up to an effective critical temperature, whose dependence on size is also algebraic. This suggests that magic, differently from entanglement, does not necessarily undergo a sudden death.

Title: Current-based metrology with two-terminal mesoscopic conductors
Authors: Shishir Khandelwal, Gabriel T. Landi, Géraldine Haack, Mark T. Mitchison
Abstract: The traditional approach to quantum parameter estimation focuses on the quantum state, deriving fundamental bounds on precision through the quantum Fisher information. In most experimental settings, however, performing arbitrary quantum measurements is highly unfeasible. In open quantum systems, an alternative approach to metrology involves the measurement of stochastic currents flowing from the system to its environment. However, the present understanding of current-based metrology is mostly limited to Markovian master equations. Considering a parameter estimation problem in a two-terminal mesoscopic conductor, we identify the key elements that determine estimation precision within the Landauer-Büttiker formalism. Crucially, this approach allows us to address arbitrary coupling and temperature regimes. Furthermore, we obtain analytical results for the precision in linear-response and zero-temperature regimes. For the specific parameter estimation task that we consider, we demonstrate that the boxcar transmission function is optimal for current-based metrology in all parameter regimes.

Title: Comment on "Redundancy Channels in the Conformal Bootstrap" by S. R. Kousvos and A. Stergiou
Authors: Slava Rychkov
Abstract: Recent work by Kousvos and Stergiou criticises our work with Zhong Ming Tan [arXiv:1505.00963]. The issue is CFT scaling dimension computations in perturbative Renormalization Group. We identified operators whose correlation functions differ by contact terms. This is allowed because CFT only describes correlation functions away from coincident points. They instead renormalize the contact terms, which are eventually dropped. Our way is not only correct, but preferable as it operates with the minimal set of quantities.

Title: Quantum-to-Classical Transition via Single-Shot Generalized Measurements
Authors: Zhenyu Xu
Abstract: Quantum-to-classical transition for finite-dimensional systems is widely considered to occur continuously, yet the mechanism underlying the intermediate stage remains unclear. In this work, we address this challenge by adopting an operational framework to bridge discrete generalized coherent state positive-operator-valued measurements and continuous isotropic depolarizing channels. Our unified treatment reveals how dimensionality and decoherence rate collectively govern the quantum-to-classical transition. Notably, we demonstrate that a single-shot generalized measurement can eliminate most negative quasi-probabilities in phase space for finite-dimensional systems. Furthermore, we propose quantum circuit implementations achievable with current state-of-the-art quantum technologies.

Title: Discrete solitons in Rydberg atom chains
Authors: Aron Kerschbaumer, Jean-Yves Desaules, Marko Ljubotina, Maksym Serbyn
Abstract: Solitons - localized wave packets that travel without spreading - play a central role in understanding transport and properties of nonlinear systems, from optical fibers to fluid dynamics. In quantum many-body systems, however, such robust excitations are typically destroyed by thermalization. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the existence of solitonic excitations in high-energy states of Rydberg atom chains in the regime of strong nearest-neighbor Rydberg blockade. These localized wave packets propagate directionally atop a special class of reviving initial states related to quantum many-body scars and are capable of carrying energy. Exhibiting long coherence times, these states constitute a novel type of non-ergodic quantum dynamics and can be efficiently implemented on Rydberg atom simulators. In addition to a phenomenological description of solitons, we identify their counterpart in a classical nonlinear dynamical system obtained from a variational projection of the quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the potential use of solitons in quantum information transfer and conjecture their relevance for the anomalous energy transport reported in numerical studies of Rydberg atom arrays.

Title: A superinductor in a deep sub-micron integrated circuit

Abstract: Superinductors are circuit elements characterised by an intrinsic impedance in excess of the superconducting resistance quantum ($R_\text{Q}\approx6.45~$k$\Omega$), with applications from metrology and sensing to quantum computing. However, they are typically obtained using exotic materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions, superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC), exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator arrays.

Title: Topology-Enhanced Superconducting Qubit Networks for In-Sensor Quantum Information Processing
Authors: J. Settino, G. G. Luciano, A. Di Bartolomeo, P. Silvestrini, M. Lisitskiy, B. Ruggiero, F. Romeo
Abstract: We investigate the influence of topology on the magnetic response of inductively coupled superconducting flux-qubit networks. Using exact diagonalization methods and linear response theory, we compare the magnetic response of linear and cross-shaped array geometries, used as paradigmatic examples. We find that the peculiar coupling matrix in cross-shaped arrays yields a significant enhancement of the magnetic flux response compared to linear arrays, this network-topology effect arising from cooperative coupling among the central and the peripheral qubits. These results establish quantitative design criteria for function-oriented superconducting quantum circuits, with direct implications for advancing performance in both quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Concerning the latter, by exploiting the non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics of such arrays, we demonstrate their suitability for quantum reservoir computing technology. This dual functionality suggests a novel platform in which the same device serves both as a quantum-limited electromagnetic sensor and as a reservoir capable of signal processing, enabling integrated quantum sensing and processing architectures.

Title: High-precision baryon number cumulants from lattice QCD in a finite box: cumulant ratios, Lee-Yang zeros and critical endpoint predictions
Authors: Alexander Adam, Szabolcs Borsányi, Zoltan Fodor, Jana N. Guenther, Piyush Kumar, Paolo Parotto, Attila Pásztor, Chik Him Wong
Abstract: We have performed high-statistics lattice simulations using 4HEX improved staggered fermions on $16^3 \times 8$ lattices. We calculated the Taylor expansion coefficients of the pressure with respect to the baryochemical potential to the tenth order at zero, and fourth order at purely imaginary chemical potentials. We used this data to construct rational function approximations of the free energy. We use a rational ansatz that explicitly satisfies the charge conjugation symmetry and the Roberge-Weiss periodicity, which are exact properties of the QCD free energy. We use this ansatz to estimate the position of Lee-Yang zeros in the complex chemical potential plane. The temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the Lee-Yang zeros is then fitted with ansätze motivated by the universal behavior of the free energy near a 3D Ising critical point. In principle, this allows one to estimate the temperature of the critical endpoint. We consider several sources of systematic errors. On this single lattice spacing we find that with $84\%$ probability, the chiral critical endpoint is either below $103$~MeV temperature or it does not exist. We also identify some caveats of the method, which do not disappear even with the extremely high statistics of this present study. We discuss to what extent these can be eliminated by future high statistics lattice analyses.

Title: State transfer analysis for linear spin chains with non-uniform on-site energies
Authors: Chad C. Nelmes, Irene D'Amico, Timothy P. Spiller
Abstract: High fidelity state transfer is an important ingredient of distributed quantum information processing. We present and analyse results on perfect and quasi-perfect state transfer with linear spin chains incorporating non-uniform on-site energies. The motivation is maintenance of coupling uniformity, which could be beneficial for some physical implementations. We relate this coupling uniformity to a particle in a discrete potential analogue. Our analysis further considers the statistical variation in couplings and on-site energies, as a function of increasing chain site number N.

Title: Local nanoscale probing of electron spins using NV centers in diamond
Authors: Sergei Trofimov, Christos Thessalonikios, Victor Deinhart, Alexander Spyrantis, Lucas Tsunaki, Kseniia Volkova, Katja Höflich, Boris Naydenon
Abstract: Substitutional nitrogen atoms in a diamond crystal (P1 centers) are, on one hand, a resource for creation of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, that have been widely employed as nanoscale quantum sensors. On the other hand, P1's electron spin is a source of paramagnetic noise that degrades the NV's performance by shortening its coherence time. Accurate quantification of nitrogen concentration is therefore essential for optimizing diamond-based quantum devices. However, bulk characterization methods based on optical absorption or electron paramagnetic resonance often overlook local variations in nitrogen content. In this work, we use a helium ion microscope to fabricate nanoscale NV center ensembles at predefined sites in a diamond crystal containing low concentrations of nitrogen. We then utilize these NV-based probes to measure the local nitrogen concentration on the level of 230 ppb (atomic parts per billion) using the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique. Moreover, by comparing the DEER spectra with numerical simulations, we managed to determine the concentration of other unknown paramagnetic defects created during the ion implantation, reaching 15 ppb depending on the implantation dose.

Abstract: Diamond is the hardest natural material and thus offers unique insights into materials design. Extreme pressures and temperatures create conditions that allow even strong and brittle materials like diamond to deform plastically and exhibit flow strength, i.e., resistance to plastic flow. Despite significant research, the upper limit of flow strength in diamond materials under high energy conditions remains uncertain, and the mechanisms driving the deformation are a subject of intense debate. Here, we demonstrate that stacking-fault mediated strengthening enables nano-polycrystalline diamond (NPD) to achieve a peak flow strength of 107+-5 GPa. Achieved through shock loading to multi-megabar stresses, this unprecedented flow strength represents a five-fold increase compared to that of quasi-statically compressed NPD. Our femtosecond in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations probe this phenomenon mechanistically. Our work shows that by subjecting materials to the most extreme conditions, we can unlock unusual strength and mechanical properties.

Title: Longitudinal Magnetoresistance in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ at High Magnetic Fields of up to 100 T
Authors: Shiyue Peng, Xu-Guang Zhou, Yasuhiro H. Matsuda, Qian Chen, Masashi Tokunaga, Yuto Ishii, Satoshi Awaji, Taiga Kato, Tomonori Arita, Yutaka Yoshida
Abstract: The investigation of transport characteristics in high-temperature superconductors under magnetic fields is one of the most important topics in condensed matter physics and transport applications. For YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO), the measurements of magnetoresistance under a high magnetic field are technically challenging because the required magnetic field ($B$) to suppress the superconductivity is 100~T class. The low temperature (from 52 to 150 K) longitudinal magnetoresistance ($B$$\parallel$ab-plane$\parallel$$J$, where $J$ is an electrical current) was measured up to 103~T in optimally doped YBCO thin films. A radio frequency reflection method and the single-turn coil technique were employed. The electrical resistivity $\rho_{ab}$ exhibited a non-saturating magnetoresistance behavior until the highest field region, with the slope $\beta (=d \rho/d B)$ showing a pronounced deviation compared to the transverse magnetoresistance ($B$$\parallel$c-axis) case. These findings suggest a potential contribution due to the non-orbital origin in the high field phase of YBCO, because the quasiparticle orbital motion is expected to be absent in the longitudinal magnetoresistance.

Title: Defect design in ferroelectrics -- new insights on agglomeration
Authors: Sheng-Han Teng, Anna Grünebohm
Abstract: Functional properties of ferroelectrics and their change with time depend crucially on the defect structure. In particular, point defects and bias fields induced by defect dipoles modify the field hysteresis and play an important role in fatigue and aging. However, a full understanding on how order, agglomeration and strength of defect dipoles affect phase stability and functional properties is still lacking. To close these gaps in knowledge, we screen these parameters by \textit{ab\ initio} based molecular dynamics simulations with the effective Hamiltonian method for the prototypical ferroelectric material (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. Our findings suggest that the {\it{active surface area}} of the defects, rather than the defect concentration is the decisive factor. For a fixed defect concentration, clustering reduces the {\it{active surface area}} and thus the defect-induced changes of phase stability and field hysteresis. Particularly planar agglomerates of defects appear as promising route for the material design as their impact on the field hysteresis can be controlled by the field direction and their impact on the phase stability shows a cross-over with the strength of the defect dipoles. For this agglomeration, we furthermore show that a pinched double-loop field hysteresis allows for large recoverable stored energy which can outperform the response of pristine (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ even in its paraelectric phase.

Title: Entanglement properties of photon-magnon crystal from nonlinear perspective
Authors: M. Wanic, C. Jasiukiewicz, Z. Toklikishvili, V. Jandieri, M. Trybus, E. Jartych, S. K. Mishra, L. Chotorlishvili
Abstract: Quantifying the entanglement between two continuous bosonic modes, such as magnons and photons, is not trivial. The logarithmic negativity, calculated through the quantum Langevin equations is subjected to thermal noise. However this method requires further approximation. The phase space of a generic nonlinear system contains topologically different regions, and the steady state may correspond to the different types of fixed points, such as Saddle Points, Stable or unstable Spirals, and Nodes. In the present work, we propose a new procedure. Namely, we derived the complete set of nonlinear equations, which includes equations for the magnon and photon number operators and phases. We show that not only number operators but also phases are important for exploring the character of the fixed point, and magnon-photon entanglement. We showed that methods of the qualitative theory of nonlinear differential equations are also relevant for photon-magnon entanglement problems. Our main finding is that entanglement is not defined in the Saddle Point region. On the other hand, the maximum of the entanglement corresponds to the region near the border between the Stable node and Stable spiral regions. Our approach is quite general. However, we did calculations for a particular system: photon-magnon crystal based on the yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film with the periodic air holes drilled in the film. Our interest focuses on magnons with a particular wavelength and frequency corresponding to the magnon condensate. Those magnons couple strongly with the photons of similar frequency. We discuss in detail the interaction between magnons and photons originating from the magneto-electric coupling and the effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We show that this interaction is responsible for the robust photon-magnon entanglement in the system.

Title: Stability and decay of subradiant patterns in a quantum gas with photon-mediated interactions
Authors: Alexander Baumgärtner, Simon Hertlein, Tom Schmit, Davide Dreon, Carlos Máximo, Xiangliang Li, Giovanna Morigi, Tobias Donner
Abstract: Metastability and its relaxation mechanisms challenge our understanding of the stability of quantum many-body systems, revealing a gap between the microscopic dynamics of the individual components and the effective descriptions used for macroscopic observables. We observe excited self-ordered subradiant patterns in a quantum gas coupled to two optical cavities and report lifetimes far beyond the system's typical timescales. These patterns eventually decay through an abrupt transition reordering the atoms into a superradiant phase. Ab-initio theory fully captures this macroscopic behavior, revealing that the subradiant patterns are stabilized by photon-mediated long-range interactions, thereby manifesting universal features of metastability characteristic of long-range interacting systems, as in astrophysics and plasma physics. Our work sheds light on the microscopic mechanisms stabilizing quantum states of matter and highlights the potential of photon-mediated forces for engineering correlations in many-body quantum systems.

Title: On the origins of charge transport in spin crossover complexes
Authors: Archit Dhingra, M. Zaid Zaz
Abstract: Spin crossover (SCO) complexes are highly promising candidates for a myriad of potential applications in room-temperature electronics; however, as it stands, establishing a clear connection between their spin-state switching and transport properties has been far from trivial. In this Perspective, an effort to unravel the underlying charge transport mechanism in these SCO complexes, via a general theory, is made. The theory presented herein is aimed at providing a unifying picture that explains the widely different trends observed in the spin-crossover-dependent carrier transport properties in the SCO molecular thin film systems.

Title: Interplay of Charge Density Wave and Magnetism on the Kagomé Lattice
Authors: Yu-Han Lin, Jin-Wei Dong, Ruiqing Fu, Xian-Xin Wu, Ziqiang Wang, Sen Zhou
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of charge density wave (CDW) order in the magnetic kagomé metal FeGe, we study the single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model on the kagomé lattice, where $U$, $V_1$, and $V_2$ are the onsite, nearest neighbor, and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. When the Fermi level lies in the flat band, the instability toward ferromagnetic (FM) order gives rise to a FM half-metal at sufficiently large onsite $U$. Intriguingly, at band filling $n=17/24$, the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity of the spin-minority bands of the half-metal. We show that, due to the unique geometry and sublattice interference on the kagomé lattice at van Hove singularity, the intersite Coulomb interactions $V_1$ and $V_2$ drive a real and an imaginary bond-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ CDW instability, respectively. The FM loop current CDW with complex bond orders is a spin-polarized Chern insulator exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The bond fluctuations are found to be substantially enhanced compared to the corresponding nonmagnetic kagomé metals at van Hove filling, providing a concrete model realization of the bond-ordered CDWs, including the FM loop current CDW, over the onsite charge density ordered states. When the spins are partially polarized, we find that the formation of bond-ordered CDWs enhances substantially the ordered magnetic moments. These findings provide physical insights for the emergence of loop-current and bond-ordered CDW and their interplay with magnetism on the kagomé lattice, with possible connections to the magnetic kagomé metal FeGe.

Title: Magnetic anisotropy effect on stabilizing magnetization plateaus of kagome strip chain Heisenberg antiferromagnets
Authors: Chiara Bruzzi, Jian-Xin Zhu, Yixuan Huang
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic effect of magnetization plateaus in the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a kagome strip chain. The kagome strip chain Heisenberg model, composed of a hexagonal net of triangles forming five-site unit cells, exhibits four magnetization plateaus in the presence of an applied magnetic field. Using numerical density matrix renormalization group method, we find that the magnetization plateaus are stable against anisotropic interactions in the same direction of the applied magnetic field, but the plateaus become much smaller with anisotropic interactions in other directions. We further show the anisotropic effect of the magnon excitations of the 0.6 plateau state using linear spin wave theory. The magnon bandwidth remains small when tuning the anisotropic interactions along the field where the magnetization plateau is stable, while the band becomes more dispersive with anisotropic interactions perpendicular to the field. In addition, upon tuning down the interaction strength for the two lower legs below a critical value, the Hamiltonian of the kagome strip chain is dominated by two separate spin chains. This can be used to determine the effective lattice structure in materials with strong distortions. Our results enhance the theoretical understanding of the anisotropic effect and the nature of magnetization plateaus in kagome strip chain materials, which can contribute to the design and manipulation of kagome materials with tailored properties.

Title: Quantum Sensing of Broadband Spin Dynamics and Magnon Transport in Antiferromagnets
Authors: Alex Lee Melendez, Shekhar Das, Francisco Ayala Rodriguez, I-Hsuan Kao, Wenhao Liu, Archibald J. Williams, Bing Lv, Joshua Goldberger, Shubhayu Chatterjee, Simranjeet Singh, P. Chris Hammel
Abstract: Optical detection of magnetic resonance using quantum spin sensors (QSS) provides a spatially local and sensitive technique to probe spin dynamics in magnets. However, its utility as a probe of antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) remains an open question. We report the first experimental demonstration of optically detected AFMR in layered van der Waals antiferromagnets (AF) up to frequencies of 24 GHz. We leverage QSS spin relaxation due to low-frequency magnetic field fluctuations arising from collective dynamics of magnons excited by the uniform AFMR mode. First, through AFMR spectroscopy we characterize the intrinsic exchange fields and magnetic anisotropies of the AF. Second, using the localized sensitivity of the QSS we demonstrate magnon transport over tens of micrometers. Finally, we find that optical detection efficiency increases with increasing frequency. This showcases the dual capabilities of QSS as detectors of high frequency magnetization dynamics and magnon transport, paving the way for understanding and controlling the magnetism of antiferromagnets.

Title: Amplitude mode in a multi-gap superconductor MgB$_2$ investigated by terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy
Authors: Kota Katsumi, Jiahao Liang, Ralph Romero III, Ke Chen, Xiaoxing Xi, N. P. Armitage
Abstract: We have investigated the terahertz (THz) nonlinear response of the multigap superconductor MgB$_2$, using THz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (THz 2DCS). With broadband THz drive fields, we identified a nonlinear response at twice the lower superconducting gap energy $2\Delta_{\pi}$ at the lowest temperatures. Using narrow-band THz driving pulses, we observed first (FH) and third harmonic responses. The FH intensity shows a monotonic increase with decreasing temperature when properly normalized by the driving field strength. This is distinct from the single-gap superconductor NbN, where the FH signal exhibited a resonant enhancement at temperatures when twice the gap energy $2\Delta$ was resonant with the driving photon energy, which was interpreted to originate from the superconducting amplitude mode. Our results in MgB$_2$ are consistent with a well-defined amplitude mode only at the lowest temperatures and indicate strong damping as temperature increases. This likely indicates the importance of interband coupling in MgB$_2$ and its influence on the nature of the amplitude mode and its damping.

Title: Observation of Local Pairs through Nonequilibrium Terahertz Spectroscopy in YBa2Cu3O7-δ Below Tc
Authors: Jinzhong Zhang, Qingming Huang, Zhangqiang Yang, Zhiyuan Sun, Ye Yang
Abstract: Pairing states are essential to understanding the underlying mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. Here the non-superconducting state in an optimally doped YBa_2 Cu_3 O_(7-{\delta}) film was driven out of equilibrium by an optical pump with low fluence at a temperature well below the critical temperature (T_c), and its recovery dynamics were exclusively measured using transient terahertz spectroscopy. The pump-fluence dependent experiments unveiled evidence of local pairs without superconductivity coexisting with the superconducting Cooper pairs. An energy gap opening induced by the local pairing with short-range coherence was invoked to rationalize the temperature-dependent recovery time of local pairs with a characteristic divergence at a temperature substantially below T_c. These local pairs displayed remarkable likeness to the short-range pair-density-wave state. Our finding sheds light on understanding the dynamic interplay between the coexisting superconducting and non-superconducting pairs in cuprate superconductors.

Title: Fibonacci-Modulation-Induced Multiple Topological Anderson Insulators
Authors: Ruijiang Ji, Zhihao Xu
Abstract: We uncover the emergence of multiple topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) in a 1D spin-orbit coupled (SOC) chain driven by Fibonacci modulation, transforming a trivial band structure into a cascade of topologically nontrivial phases. This intriguing phenomenon is marked by the appearance of zero-energy modes and transitions in the $\mathcal{Z}_2$ topological quantum number. Strikingly, as the SOC amplitude decreases, the number of TAI phases grows, a behavior intricately linked to the fractal structure of the energy spectrum induced by Fibonacci modulation. Unlike conventional TAI phases, which exhibit fully localized eigenstates, the wave functions in the Fibonacci-modulated TAI phases exhibit multifractal behavior. Furthermore, this model can be experimentally realized in a Bose-Einstein condensate along the momentum lattice, where its topological transitions and multifractal properties can be probed through quench dynamics. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic disorder-induced topological phases and their intricate multifractal nature.

Title: Two-Peak Heat Capacity Accounts for $R\ln(2)$ Entropy and Ground State Access in the Dipole-Octupole Pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$
Authors: E. M. Smith, A. Fitterman, R. Schäfer, B. Placke, A. Woods, S. Lee, S. H.-Y. Huang, J. Beare, S. Sharma, D. Chatterjee, C. Balz, M. B. Stone, A. I. Kolesnikov, A. R. Wildes, E. Kermarrec, G. M. Luke, O. Benton, R. Moessner, R. Movshovich, A. D. Bianchi, B. D. Gaulin
Abstract: Magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high-quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K are reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However, a second sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, signifying the entrance to the ground state. The ground state appears to have gapped excitations, as even the most abrupt extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K fully accounts for the $R\ln(2)$ entropy associated with the pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$ at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$ for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical spin liquid to a quantum spin liquid (QSL). For both scenarios, comparison of the measured $C_P$ with NLC calculations suggests that weak interactions beyond the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian become relevant below $T \sim 0.25$ K. The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI). Together with the peak in the heat capacity at $T_1$, this diffuse scattering from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ is suggestive of a classical spin liquid regime above $T_1$ that is distinct from the zero-entropy quantum ground state below $T_1$.

Title: Topological semimetal with coexisting nodal points and nodal lines
Authors: Bing-Bing Luo, Ming-Jian Gao, Jun-Hong An
Abstract: Featuring exotic quantum transport and surface states, topological semimetals can be classified into nodal-point, nodal-line, and nodal-surface semimetals according to the degeneracy and dimensionality of their nodes. However, a topological semimetal that possesses both nodal points and nodal lines is rarely reported. Here, we propose a scheme to construct this type of topological semimetal, which simultaneously exhibits hinge Fermi arcs and drumhead surface states. Then, by applying periodic driving on the system, we find a hybrid-order topological semimetal with nodal points and rich nodal-line structures and its conversion into a first-order topological semimetal, which are absent in a static system. Our results enrich the family of topological semimetals, and establish a foundation for further exploration of their potential applications.

Title: Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes
Authors: Ankit Singh, Vinay Vaibhav, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.

Title: Resistive Anomaly near a Ferromagnetic Phase Transition: A Classical Memory Effect
Authors: Dmitrii L. Maslov, Vladimir I. Yudson, Cristian D. Batista
Abstract: We investigate resistive anomalies in metals near ferromagnetic phase transitions, focusing on the role of long-range critical fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that diffusive motion of electrons near the critical temperature ($T_c$) enhances a singular behavior of the resistivity near $T_c$ through a classical memory effect, surpassing the prediction by Fisher and Langer \cite{Fisher:1968}. We show that, close enough to $T_c$, the resistivity exhibits a cusp or anticusp, whose profile is controlled by the critical exponent of the order parameter. We also parameterize the non-Drude behavior of the optical conductivity due to a classical memory effect in terms of critical exponents. These findings offer a deeper understanding of resistive anomalies and their connection to critical exponents in metallic systems.

Title: Composition effect in the thermo-mechanical behavior of glasses, and its modelization
Authors: Rene Alvarez-Donado, Matias Sepulveda-Macias, Anne Tanguy
Abstract: We employed molecular dynamics simulations to explore comparatively the thermo-mechanical behavior of two glass materials-an oxide silica glass (SiO2) and a binary Cu-Zr-based metallic alloy (Cu50Zr50)-during shear and elongation deformation cycles. By calculating the energy balance and tracking the temperature evolution of both glasses under deformation cycles, we are able to propose, for each of them, a constitutive law which accurately reproduces the self-heating process due to plastic deformation. These relatively simple constitutive laws involve strain rate sensitivity and a non-linear temperature dependence of the thermal dilatancy coefficients, as well as strain gradient plasticity. To identify the right parameters, both glasses are equilibrated at very low temperature (10 K) and two independent deformation rates were applied to each sample for each type of deformation. Thermal attenuation is greatly amplified in silica compared to the metallic glass. Moreover, using precise atomic description of the instantaneous deformation, combined with exact coarse-graining procedure, we show, in silica, that self-heating is mainly supported by inhomogeneous strain gradient plasticity with nanometric characteristic lengthscales.

Title: Emergence of universality in transport of noisy free fermions
Authors: João Costa, Pedro Ribeiro, Andrea De Luca
Abstract: We analyze the effects of various forms of noise on one-dimensional systems of non-interacting fermions. In the strong noise limit, we demonstrate, under mild assumptions, that the statistics of the fermionic correlation matrix in the thermodynamic limit follow a universal form described by the recently introduced quantum simple symmetric exclusion process (Q-SSEP). For charge transport, we show that Q-SSEP, along with all models in its universality class, shares the same large deviation function for the transferred charge as the classical SSEP model. The method we introduce to derive this result relies on a gauge-like invariance associated with the choice of the bond where the current is measured. This approach enables the explicit calculation of the cumulant generating function for both Q-SSEP and SSEP and establishes an exact correspondence between them. These analytical findings are validated by extensive numerical simulations. Our results establish that a wide range of noisy free-fermionic models share the same Q-SSEP universality class and show that their transport properties are essentially classical.

Title: Dislocations saturation in slip rate-driven processes and initial microstructure effects for large plastic deformation of crystals
Authors: Jalal Smiri, Oguz Umut Salman, Ioan R. Ionescu
Abstract: Dislocation-density-based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructural changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip rate-driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. We point out the existence of saturation dislocation densities and the role played by the initial dislocation density which significantly influences material hardening or softening responses. Since the initial micro-structure, modeled through the dislocation density, could be related to the size or the sample preparation process, implicit size-dependent effects can also be conjectured. To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.

Title: Magnetic-field-tuned randomness in inhomogeneous altermagnets
Authors: Anzumaan R. Chakraborty, Jörg Schmalian, Rafael M. Fernandes
Abstract: Altermagnetic (AM) states have compensated collinear magnetic configurations that are invariant under a combination of real-space rotation and time reversal. While these symmetries forbid a direct bilinear coupling of the AM order parameter with a magnetic field, they generally enable piezomagnetism, manifested as a trilinear coupling with magnetic field and strain. Here, we show that, because of this coupling, in an altermagnet subjected to random strain, the magnetic field triggers an effective random field conjugate to the AM order parameter, providing a rare realization of a tunable random-field Ising model. Specifically, we find two competing effects promoted by an external magnetic field: an increasing random-field disorder, which suppresses long-range AM order, and an enhanced coupling to elastic fluctuations, which favors AM order. By solving the corresponding random-field transverse-field Ising model via a mean-field approach, we obtain the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram of an inhomogeneous AM state for different strengths of random-strain disorder, unveiling the emergence of a field-induced reentrant AM phase. We also discuss the fingerprints of this rich behavior on several experimentally-accessible quantities, such as the shear modulus, the elasto-caloric effect coefficient, and the AM order parameter. Our results reveal an unusual but experimentally-feasible path to tune AM order with uniform magnetic fields.

Title: Dynamic Training Enhances Machine Learning Potentials for Long-Lasting Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Ivan Žugec, Tin Hadži Veljković, Maite Alducin, J. Iñaki Juaristi
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are vital for exploring complex systems in computational physics and chemistry. While machine learning methods dramatically reduce computational costs relative to ab initio methods, their accuracy in long-lasting simulations remains limited. Here we propose dynamic training (DT), a method designed to enhance accuracy of a model over extended MD simulations. Applying DT to an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) on the challenging system of a hydrogen molecule interacting with a palladium cluster anchored to a graphene vacancy demonstrates a superior prediction accuracy compared to conventional approaches. Crucially, the DT architecture-independent design ensures its applicability across diverse machine learning potentials, making it a practical tool for advancing MD simulations.

Title: A collapsed interface approach to resolve grain boundaries in finite element simulations of polycrystalline diffusion
Authors: Lena Scholz, Yongliang Ou, Blazej Grabowski, Felix Fritzen
Abstract: Atomic diffusion affects the properties of various engineering materials, which predominantly occur in the polycrystalline state. A rigorous description of polycrystalline diffusion must therefore account for crystallographic defects, especially grain boundaries (GBs), whose structure and volume fraction - and hence the effective grain size - govern mass transport. Experiments and atomistic simulations consistently show that GBs can accelerate diffusion by up to several orders of magnitude and that fluxes along and across the interface are generally anisotropic. Conventional mesoscale models either neglect GBs or invoke idealized analytical corrections. Fully resolved finite-element meshes are accurate but computationally infeasible when nanometer-thin GB layers are involved. We introduce a collapsed-interface finite element that integrates the GB thickness analytically and embeds the result in a two-dimensional surface element. The formulation (i) treats in-plane and through-plane diffusivity independently, (ii) couples to the surrounding grain matrix without the need for mesh manipulations, and (iii) parametrizes both grain size and GB volume fraction via simple affine scalings, allowing systematic variation without remeshing. Effective diffusivity tensors are extracted by linear computational homogenization. The new finite element reproduces three-dimensional GB transport phenomena - channeled fluxes, concentration discontinuities - at a fraction of the computational cost of explicit models. Parametric studies spanning multiple orders of magnitude in GB diffusivity reveal four distinct diffusion regimes and quantify their impact on the overall response. The framework thus connects atomistic data and continuum predictions, providing an efficient tool for diffusion-driven design and optimization of polycrystalline materials.

Title: Quantum tomography of the superfluid-insulator transition for a mesoscopic atomtronic ring
Authors: Yehoshua Winsten, Doron Cohen
Abstract: We provide a phase-space perspective for the analysis of the superfluid-insulator transition for finite-size Bose-Hubbard circuits. We explore how the eigenstates parametrically evolve as the inter-particle interaction is varied, paying attention to the fingerprints of chaos at the quantum phase-transition. Consequently, we demonstrate that the tomographic spectrum reflects the existence of mixed-regions of chaos and quasi-regular motion in phase-space. This tomographic semiclassical approach is much more efficient and informative compared to the traditional "level statistics" inspection. Of particular interest is the characterization of the fluctuations that are exhibited by the many-body eigenstates. In this context, we associate with each eigenstate a Higgs measure for the identification of amplitude modes of the order-parameter. Finally we focus on the formation of the lowest Goldstone and Higgs bands.

Title: Ab initio X-ray Near-Edge Spectroscopy of Sodium-Based Multi-Alkali Antimonides
Authors: Chung Xu, Richard Schier, Caterina Cocchi
Abstract: Multi-alkali antimonides (MAAs) are promising materials for vacuum electron sources. While sodium-based MAAs have demonstrated superior characteristics for ultrabright electron sources, their synthesis remains challenging, often resulting in mixed stoichiometries and polycrystalline domains. To address this complexity and guide the characterization of experimentally grown photocathodes, we present a comprehensive theoretical study of the X-ray near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) of four ternary MAAs: cubic Na$_2$KSb and hexagonal NaK$_2$Sb, representing the experimentally known phase of each stoichiometry, as well as hexagonal Na$_2$KSb and cubic NaK$_2$Sb, two computationally predicted polymorphs. Employing state-of-the-art ab initio methods based on all-electron density-functional theory and the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we compute and analyze the XANES at the sodium and potassium K-edges, potassium L$_{2,3}$-edge, and antimony K and L$_2$-edges. Our analysis reveals distinct spectral fingerprints for the experimentally known phases, cubic Na$_2$KSb and hexagonal NaK$_2$Sb, particularly at the sodium K-edge and potassium L$_{2,3}$-edge, providing useful indications for their identification in complex samples. We further investigate the role of excitonic effects by comparing BSE spectra and their counterparts obtained in the independent-particle approximation, highlighting their significant influence on the near-edge features, especially for shallower core levels. Our findings offer a useful theoretical benchmark for the experimental characterization and diagnostics of sodium-based MAA photocathodes, complementing experiments on resolved phases and providing the spectral fingerprints of computationally predicted phases that could emerge in polycrystalline samples.

Title: Surface hopping simulations show valley depolarization driven by exciton-phonon resonance
Authors: Alex Krotz, Roel Tempelaar
Abstract: Resonances between excitonic transitions and nuclear coordinates have been shown to drive a variety of excited-state dynamical phenomena in molecular systems. Here, we report mixed quantum--classical simulations showing similar resonances to primarily contribute to valley depolarization in monolayer MoS$_2$. The applied simulation framework combines reciprocal-space surface hopping with microscopic models of the quasiparticle band structure, electron--hole interactions, and carrier--phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations. This enables low-cost excited-state dynamics simulations that are microscopic, non-Markovian, and non-perturbative in the carrier--phonon interaction. The framework furthermore retains explicit information on transient phonon occupancies, through which we show a resonance between the dominant optical phonon branch and the lowest exciton band to largely drive valley depolarization, by activating a Maialle--Silva--Sham mechanism. Resulting valley polarization times are consistent with experimental measurements across temperatures.

Title: Enantiosensitive locking of photoelectron spin and cation orientation
Authors: Philip Caesar M. Flores, Stefanos Carlström, Serguei Patchkovskii, Misha Ivanov, Andres F. Ordonez, Olga Smirnova
Abstract: Chirality describes the asymmetry between an object and its mirror image, underpinning diverse functionalities across all scales of matter - from molecules and aggregates to thin films and bulk chiral materials. A particularly intriguing example is chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where chiral structures orient electron spins enantio-sensitively. Despite extensive research, the fundamental origin of spin-chirality coupling, the unexpectedly large magnitude of the CISS effect, and the possible role of electromagnetic fields remain unclear. Here, we address these issues by examining the simplest scenario: spin-resolved photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We uncover two universal geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photodynamics, arising solely from electric-dipole interactions and previously unrecognized. These mechanisms operate effectively even in amorphous chiral media under isotropic illumination and persist at weak spin-orbit coupling, underscoring fundamental aspects of spin-chirality interplay. We further identify an unreported phenomenon central to CISS: locking of photoelectron spin orientation to molecular geometry. Our findings provide a unified geometric framework with broad implications, extending from CISS and asymmetric catalysis to spin textures in chiral crystals and chiral quantum materials such as Weyl semimetals.

Abstract: Small-footprint, low-power arrays of coupled coherent emitters with the capability of near- and far-field engineering and coherence control are highly sought after to meet modern nanophotonics evolving needs. Between existing solutions based on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, phase masks in bulk traditional cavity-based systems, and lattices of exciton-polariton condensates, only the strongly light-matter coupled systems were shown to be capable of controlled on-chip interaction between the individual coherent states while often operating at cryogenic temperatures. Here we demonstrate electrically controlled in-plane interaction between optically reconfigurable spatially separated lasing states, operating at room temperature in the weak light-matter coupling regime. We show spatially extended coherent lasing state or "supermode" with wide-range micro-scale control of near-field, far-field and on-chip phase-locking tuning functionality. An extended lasing state appears due to near-field transverse coupling between distinct spatially pumped lasing states in the plane of an organic liquid crystal-filled microcavity. We realize electrical control over the interaction strength between lasing states and corresponding mutual coherence going beyond nearest neighbours through electrical tuning of the microcavity optical modes with external voltage, and a spin-selective directional coupling regime by using a photonic analogue of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction.

Title: The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics
Authors: Ryan T. Grimm, Alexander J. Staat, Joel D. Eaves
Abstract: The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and physical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical evaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in the number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The problem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte Carlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum algorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of matrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational complexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm compresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an unentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term in the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small contributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral decimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable and integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral decimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of noninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the absolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function of temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced density matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each coupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to these models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation. When conventional methods become intractable, integral decimation can be a powerful alternative.

Authors: Sebastian Zeilinger, Johannes Güttinger, Klemens Prügl, Michael Kirsch, Joshua M. Salazar-Mejía, Sabri Koraltan, Philip Heinrich, Sophie Zeilinger, Bernd Aichner, Florian Bruckner, Hubert Brückl, Armin Satz, Dieter Suess
Abstract: In this work we demonstrate a spin-orbit torque (SOT) magnetic field sensor, designed as a Ta/CoFeB/MgO structure, with high sensitivity and capable of active offset compensation in all three spatial directions. This is described and verified in both experiment and simulation. The measurements of magnetic fields showed an offset of 36, 50, and 37$\mathrm{\mu T}$ for x-, y-, and z-fields. Furthermore, the sensitivities of these measurements had values of 590, 580, and 490$\mathrm{V\,A^{-1}\,T^{-1}}$ in the x-, y-, and z-direction. In addition, the robustness to bias fields is demonstrated via experiments and single spin simulations by applying bias fields in y-direction. Cross sensitivities were further analyzed via single spin simulations performing a parameter sweep of different bias fields in the y- and z-direction up to $\pm$1mT. Finally, the extraction of the SOT parameters $\eta_\mathrm{DL}$ and $\eta_\mathrm{FL}$ is shown via optimization of a single-spin curve to the experimental measurements.

Title: SeWS/bilayer-SiC heterojunction: An S-scheme photocatalyst with high visible-light absorption, excellent carrier mobility and adjustable band gap
Authors: Liuzhu Yang, Wenhui Wan, Zhicui Wang, Qiuyue Ma, Yanfeng Ge, Yong Liu
Abstract: Vertically stacked heterojunctions have garnered significant attention for their tunable electronic structures and photocatalytic performance, making them promising candidates for next-generation nanodevices. Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure, optical characteristics, and charge transfer of WSSe/SiC heterojunctions. Our results reveal that SeWS/monolayer-SiC, SeWS/bilayer-SiC, and SWSe/monolayer-SiC exhibit type-II band alignment, whereas SWSe/bilayer-SiC displays type-I alignment. Notably, SeWS/bilayer-SiC possesses a direct bandgap, in contrast to the indirect bandgaps of the other three configurations. Remarkably, the SeWS/bilayer-SiC heterojunction demonstrates a high absorption coefficient ($10^{5}~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) in the visible range and exhibits exceptional anisotropy in carrier transport, with an outstanding hole mobility of $9.58 \times 10^{3}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,\mathrm{V}^{-1}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ along the Y-direction. Furthermore, combining thermodynamic stability with an S-scheme charge transfer mechanism, this system exhibits superior redox capability for photocatalytic water splitting, achieving a high hydrogen evolution efficiency of 22.15%, which surpasses the commercial viability threshold (10\%). Furthermore, we demonstrate effective band gap modulation via external electric fields and biaxial strains, with optical absorption coefficients exhibiting strong strain dependence. This work provides fundamental insights into the design of WSSe/SiC heterojunctions for high-efficiency photocatalytic and tunable photodetector applications.

Title: Future prospect of anisotropic 2D tin sulfide (SnS) for emerging electronic and quantum device applications
Authors: Abdus Salam Sarkar
Abstract: The family of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) emerging materials is rapidly evolving due to their low crystal symmetry and in-plane structural anisotropy. Among these, 2D tin sulfide (SnS) has gained significant attention because of its distinctive crystalline symmetry and the resulting extraordinary anisotropic physical properties. This perspective explores recent developments in anisotropic 2D SnS. In particular, it highlights advances in isolating high-quality SnS monolayers (1L-SnS) and in applying advanced techniques for anisotropic characterization. The discussion continues with an overview of the anisotropic optical and electronic properties of SnS, followed by recent progress in emerging electronic device applications, including energy conversion & storage, neuromorphic (synaptic) systems, spintronics and quantum technologies. In addition to presenting significant research findings on SnS, this perspective outlines current limitations and discusses emerging opportunities and future prospects for its application in quantum devices.

Title: Deciphering Chiral Superconductivity via Impurity Bound States
Authors: Yuchang Cai, Rui-Xing Zhang
Abstract: Determining the symmetry of Cooper pairs remains a central challenge in the study of unconventional superconductors, particularly for chiral states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that point-like impurities in chiral superconductors generate in-gap bound states with a distinctive asymmetry: the local density of states at the impurity site vanishes at one bound-state energy, but not at its particle-hole conjugate. We prove this behavior analytically in generic two-dimensional, single-band chiral superconductors, showing it arises from a fundamental interplay between pairing chirality and crystalline rotation symmetry. Our numerical simulations confirm that this diagnostic feature persists in multiband systems and for spatially extended impurities. Our results establish a symmetry-enforced real-space diagnostic for chiral superconductivity at the atomic scale.

Title: Characterization of fractional Chern insulator quasiparticles in moiré transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Zhao Liu, Bohao Li, Yuhao Shi, Fengcheng Wu
Abstract: We provide a detailed study of Abelian quasiparticles of valley polarized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) residing in the top valence band of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) at hole filling $\nu_h=2/3$. We construct a tight-binding model of delocalized quasiparticles to capture the energy dispersion of a single quasiparticle. We then localize quasiparticles by short-range delta impurity potentials. Unlike the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) counterpart in the lowest Landau level (LLL), the density profile around the localized FCI quasiparticle in tMoTe$_2$ depends on the location of the impurity potential and loses the continuous rotation invariance. The FCI quasiparticle localized at moiré lattice center closely follows the anyon Wannier state of the tight-binding model of the mobile quasiparticle. Despite of the difference in density profiles, we find that the excess charge around the impurity potential for the $\nu_h=2/3$ FCIs in tMoTe$_2$ is still similar to that of the $\nu=2/3$ FQH state in the LLL if an effective magnetic length on the moiré lattice is chosen as the length unit, which allows a rough estimation of the spatial extent of the FCI quasiparticle. Far away from the impurity potential, this excess charge has the tendency to reach $e/3$, as expected for the Laughlin quasiparticle. The braiding phase of two FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$ also agrees with the theoretical prediction of fractional statistics. Based on the nearly ideal quantum geometry of the top valence band of tMoTe$_2$, we propose a trial wave function for localized FCI quasiparticles, which reproduces the key feature of the density profile around a quasiparticle. We also discuss the effect of band mixing on FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$.

Title: Microscopic origin of shear bands in 2D amorphous solids from topological defects
Authors: Arabinda Bera, Debjyoti Majumdar, Timothy W. Sirk, Ido Regev, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: The formation of shear bands in amorphous solids such as glasses has remained an open question in our understanding of condensed matter and amorphous materials. Unlike in crystals, well-defined topological defects such as dislocations have been elusive due to the lack of a periodic ordered background at the atomic level. Recently, topological defects have been identified in the displacement field and in the eigenvectors of amorphous solids. Recent work has suggested that shear bands in amorphous solids coincide with an alignment of vortex-antivortex dipoles, with alternating topological charge +1/-1. Here we numerically confirm this hypothesis by means of well-controlled simulations in 2D. Surprisingly, we show that a chain of topological defects (TDs) pre-exists the shear band and is visible already in the non-affine displacement field of the elastic regime. This chain is activated into a flow band concomitantly with the disappearance and possibly annihilation of a dipole at a distance from the TDs chain. The possible underlying mechanism is reminiscent of a soliton-like rarefaction pulse remotely activated by dipole annihilation as observed in superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates.

Title: Chaos in a Nonequilibrium Two-Temperature $(T_x, T_y)$ Nosé-Hoover Cell Model
Authors: Hesam Arabzadeh, Carol Griswold Hoover, William Graham Hoover
Abstract: We revisit a two-temperature Nosé-Hoover wanderer particle embedded in a two-dimensional periodic 2x2 cell with four smooth repulsive corners  at $(x,y) = (\pm 1, \pm 1)$ to explore chaos with anisotropic thermostatting. The model employs separate thermostats in the x and y directions, enabling controlled deviations from equilibrium. By integrating the full six-dimensional equations of motion and computing the complete Lyapunov spectrum, we confirm chaos and quantify phase-space contraction with high numerical precision. The total contraction rate, interpreted as entropy production, grows nonlinearly with the thermostat anisotropy and follows a superquadratic power law, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2.44}$, deviating from linear-response theory. The approximate Kaplan-Yorke dimension reveals a fractal attractor that concentrates as $|T_x - T_y|$ increases. Momentum statistics show significant non-Gaussian behavior under strong driving. Despite its dissipative nature, the model remains strictly time-reversible, offering a pedagogically rich example of microscopic reversibility coexisting with macroscopic entropy production.

Title: Efficient Preparation of Fermionic Superfluids in an Optical Dipole Trap through Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yueyang Min, Ziliang Li, Yi Zhong, Jia-An Xuan, Jian Lin, Lei Feng, Xiaopeng Li
Abstract: We demonstrate a reinforcement learning (RL) based control framework for optimizing evaporative cooling in the preparation of strongly interacting degenerate Fermi gases of Li6. Using a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, the system autonomously explores a high-dimensional parameter space to learn optimal cooling trajectories. Compared to conventional exponential ramps, our method achieves up to 130% improvement in atomic density within a 0.5 second, revealing non-trivial control strategies that balance fast evaporation and thermalization. While our current optimization focuses on the evaporation stage, future integration of other cooling stages, such as grey molasses cooling, could further extend RL to the full preparation pipeline. Our result highlights the promise of RL as a general tool for closed-loop quantum control and automated calibration in complex atomic physics experiments.

Title: Light-hole states and hyperfine interaction in electrically-defined Ge/GeSn quantum dots
Authors: Agnieszka Miętkiewicz, Jakub Ziembicki, Krzysztof Gawarecki
Abstract: We theoretically investigate hole spins confined in a gate-defined quantum dot (QD) embedded in GeSn/Ge/GeSn quantum well (QW) structure. Owing to the tensile strain in the Ge layer, the system effectively realizes a light-hole qubit. We systematically study how various morphological parameters influence the energy spectrum, g-factors, and the hyperfine coupling to the nuclear spin bath. The simulations are carried out using a realistic, fully atomic sp$^3$d$^5$s$^*$ tight-binding model. We also perform complementary DFT calculations of wave functions near the atomic cores and use them to parameterize the hyperfine-interaction Hamiltonian. We evaluate the Overhauser field fluctuations and demonstrate that the strength of the hyperfine coupling for the lowest hole doublet crucially depends on the Sn content in the barrier. We highlight the conduction-valence band mixing, which leads to considerable $s$-type admixtures to the hole states, providing the dominant channel of hyperfine coupling due to the Fermi contact interaction.

Title: When $B_2$ is Not Enough: Evaluating Simple Metrics for Predicting Phase Separation of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins
Authors: Wesley W. Oliver, William M. Jacobs, Michael A. Webb
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the phase behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is of significant interest due to their role in many biological processes. However, effectively characterizing phase behavior and its complex dependence on protein primary sequence remains challenging. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of several simple computational metrics to quantify the propensity of single-component IDP solutions to phase separate; specific metrics considered include the single-chain radius of gyration, the second virial coefficient, and a newly proposed quantity termed the expenditure density. Each metric is computed using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations for 2,034 IDP sequences. Using machine learning, we analyze this data to understand how sequence features correlate with the predictive performance of each metric and to develop insight into their respective strengths and limitations. The expenditure density is determined to be a broadly useful metric that combines simplicity, low computational cost, and accuracy; it also provides a continuous measure that remains informative across both phase-separating and non-phase-separating sequences. Additionally, this metric shows promise in its ability to improve predictions of other properties for IDP systems. This work extends existing literature by advancing beyond binary classification, which can be useful for rapidly screening phase behavior or predicting other properties of IDP-related systems.

Title: Phonon spectrum in the spin-Peierls phase of CuGeO$_3$
Authors: L. Spitz, A. Razpopov, S. Biswas, H. Lane, S. E. Nikitin, K. Iida, R. Kajimoto, M. Fujita, M. Arai, M. Mourigal, Ch. Rüegg, R. Valentí, B. Normand
Abstract: CuGeO$_3$ has long been studied as a prototypical example of the spin-Peierls transition in a $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg chain. Despite intensive investigation of this quasi-one-dimensional material, systematic measurements and calculations of the phonon excitations in the dimerized phase have not to date been possible, leaving certain aspects of the spin-Peierls phenomenon unresolved. We perform state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations to compute the electronic structure and phonon dynamics in the low-temperature dimerized phase. We also perform high-resolution neutron spectroscopy to measure the full phonon spectrum over multiple Brillouin zones. We find excellent agreement between our numerical and experimental results that extend to all measurement temperatures. Notable features of our phonon spectra include a number of steeply dispersive modes, nonmonotonic dispersion features, and specific phonon anticrossings, which we relate to the mode eigenvectors. By calculating the magnetic interactions within DFT and studying the effects of different phonon modes on the superexchange paths, we discuss the possibility of observing spin-phonon hybridization effects in experiments performed both in and out of equilibrium.

Title: Accelerating Quantum Relaxation via Temporary Reset: A Mpemba-Inspired Approach
Authors: Ruicheng Bao, Zhonghuai Hou
Abstract: Slow relaxation processes spanning widely separated timescales pose fundamental challenges for probing steady-state properties and engineering functional quantum systems, such as quantum heat engines and quantum computing devices. We introduce a universal quantum reset protocol that enables exponential acceleration of relaxation in general Markovian open quantum systems. The protocol induces a quantum Mpemba effect, wherein systems initialized farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to it, and crucially, this acceleration persists even when the slowest decaying Lindbladian modes form complex-conjugate pairs. Unlike previous approaches, which typically target a single mode, our protocol eliminates multiple relaxation modes simultaneously. Specifically, using a simple depolarizing channel, we show that the relaxation of a dissipative transverse-field Ising chain can be significantly accelerated, underscoring the experimental feasibility of the protocol. This framework provides a versatile and experimentally feasible tool for controlling quantum relaxation timescales, with broad implications for quantum thermodynamics, computation, and state preparation.

Title: Diagnosing Thermalization via Participation Ratio in Disordered Bosonic Chains
Authors: Javier de la Cruz, Carlos Diaz-Mejia, Sergio Lerma-Hernandez, Jorge G. Hirsch
Abstract: We study thermalization in a disordered one-dimensional interacting bosonic system described by the Aubry-Andre model using full exact diagonalization. We find a broad chaotic energy window where the system's eigenstates satisfy the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), demonstrated by the smooth energy dependence of observables like entanglement entropy and local particle number, whose fluctuations decrease with system size. Dynamically, we investigate the equilibration of initial Fock states and find that thermalization is not universal. The key finding is a direct and nontrivial correlation between an initial state's delocalization in the energy eigenbasis quantified by the Participation Ratio (PR) and its subsequent equilibration. States with a high PR consistently evolve toward the microcanonical ensemble prediction, whereas those exhibiting a low PR display deviations whose magnitude inversely correlates with the PR value. This connection is quantitatively confirmed by the trace distance, providing a powerful, experimentally relevant diagnostic for predicting which initial states will reach thermal equilibrium.

Title: Non-Hermitian entanglement dip from scaling-induced exceptional criticality
Authors: Sirui Liu, Hui Jiang, Wen-Tan Xue, Qingya Li, Jiangbin Gong, Xiaogang Liu, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: It is well established that the entanglement entropy of a critical system generally scales logarithmically with system size. Yet, in this work, we report a new class of non-Hermitian critical transitions that exhibit dramatic divergent dips in their entanglement entropy scaling, strongly violating conventional logarithmic behavior. Dubbed scaling-induced exceptional criticality (SIEC), it transcends existing non-Hermitian mechanisms such as exceptional bound states and non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)-induced gap closures, which are nevertheless still governed by logarithmic entanglement scaling. Key to SIEC is its strongly scale-dependent spectrum, where eigenbands exhibit an exceptional crossing only at a particular system size. As such, the critical behavior is dominated by how the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) sweeps through the exceptional crossing with increasing system size, and not just by the gap closure per se. We provide a general approach for constructing SIEC systems based on the non-local competition between heterogeneous NHSE pumping directions, and show how a scale-dependent GBZ can be analytically derived to excellent accuracy. Beyond 1D free fermions, SIEC is expected to occur more prevalently in higher-dimensional or even interacting systems, where antagonistic NHSE channels generically proliferate. SIEC-induced entanglement dips generalize straightforwardly to kinks in other entanglement measures such as Renyi entropy, and serve as spectacular demonstrations of how algebraic and geometric singularities in complex band structures manifest in quantum information.

Title: Absorbing state phase transitions beyond directed percolation in dissipative quantum state preparation
Authors: Matthew Wampler, Nigel R. Cooper
Abstract: We show that absorbing state phase transitions where the absorbing state itself exhibits long-range phase coherence can lead to critical behavior distinct from directed percolation. To do this, we investigate a simple, purely dissipative quantum reaction-diffusion model, which may also be viewed as a dissipative quantum state preparation procedure for the (generalized) W state with errors. The "error" Lindblad jump operators preserve the W state as a dark state, but nonetheless act to decohere the system and induce the phase transition. We find cases where the preparation protocol is either fragile or robust against weak error quantum jump rates and show that local remnants of the coherence persist in the decohering phase. The distinct critical behavior stems from the spreading of coherence throughout the system at the critical point.

Title: Long-time analysis of a pair of on-lattice and continuous run-and-tumble particles with jamming interactions
Authors: Arnaud Guillin (LMBP), Leo Hahn (LMBP), Manon Michel (LMBP)
Abstract: Run-and-Tumble Particles (RTPs) are a key model of active matter. They are characterized by alternating phases of linear travel and random direction reshuffling. By this dynamic behavior, they break time reversibility and energy conservation at the microscopic level. It leads to complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena such as collective motion, pattern formation, and motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). In this work, we study two fundamental dynamical models of a pair of RTPs with jamming interactions and provide a rigorous link between their discrete- and continuous-space descriptions. We demonstrate that as the lattice spacing vanishes, the discrete models converge to a continuous RTP model on the torus, described by a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP). This establishes that the invariant measures of the discrete models converge to that of the continuous model, which reveals finite mass at jamming configurations and exponential decay away from them. This indicates effective attraction, which is consistent with MIPS. Furthermore, we quantitatively explore the convergence towards the invariant measure. Such convergence study is critical for understanding and characterizing how MIPS emerges over time. Because RTP systems are non-reversible, usual methods may fail or are limited to qualitative results. Instead, we adopt a coupling approach to obtain more accurate, non-asymptotic bounds on mixing times. The findings thus provide deeper theoretical insights into the mixing times of these RTP systems, revealing the presence of both persistent and diffusive regimes.

Title: Geometry-Driven Segregation in Periodically Textured Microfluidic Channels
Authors: Fatemeh S. Ahmadi, Hossein Hamzehpour, Reza Shaebani
Abstract: We investigate the transport dynamics of elongated microparticles in microchannel flows. While smooth-walled channels preserve the dependence of particle trajectories on initial orientation and lateral position, we show that introducing periodically textured walls can trigger robust alignment of the particle along the channel centerline. This geometry-driven alignment arises from repeated reorientation torques generated by spatially modulated shear gradients near the textured walls. A resistive force theory-based analysis reveals that the effect stems from the anisotropic hydrodynamic response of the elongated particle to local shear, with maximal alignment torque occurring at intermediate particle orientations. The alignment efficiency depends on particle elongation and the relative texture wavelength, with an optimal range for maximal effect. While the observed alignment behavior is not limited to low Reynolds numbers, the characteristic alignment length scale diverges as the Reynolds number increases toward the turbulent flow regime. These findings offer a predictive framework for designing microfluidic devices that passively sort or focus anisotropic particles, with implications for soft matter transport, biophysical flows, and microfluidic engineering.

Title: Non-coalescence and in-plane momentum generation in sessile droplet clusters
Authors: Gopal Chandra Pal, Cheuk Wing Edmond Lam, Chander Shekhar Sharma
Abstract: Intuitively, droplets in proximity merge when brought into contact. However, under certain conditions, they may not coalesce due to the entrapment of an interstitial gas film. Non-coalescence between water droplets has so far been observed during collisions of droplets moving with relative centroidal velocity, or in the presence of specific enabling effects such as high intervening gas pressures, surfactants, or large droplet sizes (diameter $\gtrsim 1~\mathrm{mm}$). Here, we report non-coalescence between water droplets over a much wider range of droplet diameters, from millimeters to as small as 100 microns, without the need for any of the above factors. Such non-coalescence occurs in sessile droplet clusters on water-repellent surfaces. When any two droplets in a cluster coalesce, the evolving interface of the coalescing droplets comes in apparent contact with other neighbouring droplets in the cluster, but does not necessarily trigger further coalescence. In fact, such apparent contact can manifest as a bouncing interaction, and depending on the initial geometric arrangement of droplets, it can result in significant lateral momentum generation, consequently leading to spontaneous in-plane self-propulsion of the participating droplets. The energy conversion efficiency of this process reaches as high as 9\% for closely packed clusters of three sessile droplets and increases further with an increase in the number of participating droplets. The resulting self-propulsion of such small droplets reveals a new pathway for passive droplet removal and surface renewal during dropwise condensation on superhydrophobic surfaces, critical in multiple applications.

Title: The Carrollian Kaleidoscope
Authors: Arjun Bagchi, Aritra Banerjee, Prateksh Dhivakar, Saikat Mondal, Ashish Shukla
Abstract: The Carroll group arises in the vanishing speed of light limit of the Poincaré group and was initially discarded as just a mathematical curiosity. However, recent developments have proved otherwise. Carroll and conformal Carroll symmetries are now ubiquitous, appearing in diverse physical phenomena starting from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity. This review aims to provide the reader a gateway into this fast-developing field. After an introduction and setting the stage with basics of the symmetry in question, we detail the construction of Carrollian and Carrollian Conformal field theories (CCFT). We then focus on applications. By far the most popular of these applications is in the context of the construction of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes (AFS) in terms of a co-dimension one dual CCFT. We review the early work on AFS$_3$ /CCFT$_2$ before delving into an in-depth analysis for the construction of the dual to 4D AFS. Two other important sets of applications are in hydrodynamics and in condensed matter physics, which we discuss in detail. Carroll hydrodynamics is introduced as the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics first and then reconstructed from a symmetry based approach. Relations to ultrarelativistic flows and connections to the quark-gluon plasma are discussed with concrete examples of the Bjorken and Gubser flow models. In condensed matter applications, we cover connections to fractons, flat bands, and phase separation in Luttinger liquid models. To conclude, we give very brief outlines of other topics of interest including string theory and black hole horizons.

Title: A semi-analytical solution for the lubrication force between two spheres approaching in viscoelastic fluids described by the Oldroyd-B model under small Deborah numbers
Authors: Alan Rosales-Romero, Adolfo Vázquez-Quesada, Marco Ellero, J. Esteban López-Aguilar
Abstract: Viscoelastic fluids play a critical role in various engineering and biological applications, where their lubrication properties are strongly influenced by relaxation times ranging from microseconds to minutes. Although the lubrication mechanism for Newtonian fluids is well-established, its extension to viscoelastic materials - particularly under squeezing flow conditions - remains less explored. This study presents a semi-analytical solution for the lubrication force between two spheres approaching in a Boger fluid under small Deborah numbers. Unlike previous works that assumed a Newtonian velocity field, we derive the velocity profile directly from the mass-momentum conservation and Oldroyd-B constitutive equations using lubrication theory and order-of-magnitude analysis techniques. Under steady-state conditions, viscoelasticity induces a marginal increase in the surface-to-surface normal force as a result of the increased pressure required to overcome the original resistance from the first normal-stress difference. Transient analyses reveal that the normal lubrication force is bounded by two Newtonian plateaus and is nonsymmetric as the spheres approach or separate. Our findings highlight the role of viscoelasticity in improving load capacity and provide new insight for modelling dense particle suspensions in Boger fluids, where short-range interactions dominate.

Title: Optimal quantum transport on a ring via locally monitored chiral quantum walks
Authors: Sara Finocchiaro, Giovanni O. Luilli, Giuliano Benenti, Matteo G. A. Paris, Luca Razzoli
Abstract: In purely coherent transport on finite networks, destructive interference can significantly suppress transfer probabilities, which can only reach high values through careful fine-tuning of the evolution time or tailored initial-state preparations. We address this issue by investigating excitation transfer on a ring, modeling it as a locally monitored continuous-time chiral quantum walk. Chirality, introduced through time-reversal symmetry breaking, imparts a directional bias to the coherent dynamics and can lift dark states. Local monitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target site, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of the evolution time. By analyzing the interplay between chirality and measurement frequency, we identify optimal conditions for maximizing the asymptotic detection probability. The optimization of this transfer protocol relies on the spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius operator, which capture the asymptotic non-unitary dynamics, and on the analysis of dark states. Our approach offers a general framework for enhancing quantum transport in monitored systems.

Title: Disentangling Boltzmann brains, the time-asymmetry of memory, the H theorem, and the second law
Authors: David Wolpert, Carlo Rovelli, Jordan Scharnhorst
Abstract: Are you, with your perceptions, memories and observational data, a Boltzmann brain, i.e., a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against taking this hypothesis seriously. Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle - and very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to circular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of them involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy values of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on which we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its "1000CE" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's stipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all make an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single moment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).

Title: From Bound States to Quantum Spin Models: Chiral Coherent Dynamics in Topological Photonic Rings
Authors: Fatemeh Davoodi
Abstract: Topological photonic systems offer a robust platform for guiding light in the presence of disorder, but their interplay with quantum emitters remains a frontier for realizing strongly correlated quantum states. Here, we explore a ring-shaped Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) photonic lattice interfaced with multiple quantum emitters to control topologically protected chiral quantum dynamics. Using a full microscopic model that includes cascaded Lindblad dynamics and chiral emitter-bath couplings, we reveal how the topology of the bath mediates nonreciprocal, long-range interactions between emitters. These interactions lead to rich manybody spin phenomena, including robust coherence, directional energy transfer, and emergent double Néel ordering, captured by an effective spin Hamiltonian derived from the system topology. We show that topological bound states enable unidirectional emission, protect coherence against dissipation, and imprint nontrivial entanglement and mutual information patterns among the emitters. In particular, we showed that under circularly polarized excitation, the emitters not only inherit spin angular momentum from the field but also serve as transducers that coherently launch the spin-orbit-coupled topological photonic modes into the far field. Our results establish a direct bridge between topological photonic baths and emergent quantum magnetism, positioning this architecture as a promising testbed for studying chiral quantum optics, topologically protected entangled states, and long-range quantum coherence.
