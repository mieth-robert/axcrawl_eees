Title: Enduring mechanical memory from the constitutive response of elastically recoverable nanostructured materials
Authors: Abhishek Gupta, Bhanugoban Maheswaran, Nicholas Jaegersberg, Komal Chawla, Ramathasan Thevamaran
Abstract: Mechanical memory and computing are gaining significant traction as means to augment traditional electronics for robust and energy efficient performance in extreme environments. However, progress has largely focused on bistable metamaterials, while traditional constitutive memory effects have been largely overlooked, primarily due to the absence of compelling experimental demonstrations in elastically recoverable materials. Here, we report constitutive return point memory (RPM) in elastically recoverable, vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) foams, analogous to magnetic hysteresis-based RPM utilized in hard drives. Unlike viscoelastic fading memory, VACNTs exhibit non-volatile memory arising from rate-independent nanoscale friction. We find that the interplay between RPM and frictional dissipation enables independent tunability of the VACNT dynamic modulus, allowing for both on-demand softening and stiffening. We leverage this property to experimentally demonstrate tunable wave speed in a VACNT array with rigid interlayers, paving the way for novel shock limiters, elastodynamic lensing, and wave-based analog mechanical computing.

Title: Direct Comparison of Static and Dynamic Measurements of Spin Generation in a Topological Insulator Thin Film
Authors: Vinay Sharma, Sharadh Jois, Ryan Van Haren, Gregory M. Stephen, M. Tomal Hossain, M. Benjamin Jungfleisch, Patrick J. Taylor, Aubrey T. Hanbicki, Adam L. Friedman
Abstract: The competition between intrinsic spin-orbit physics, magnetic phenomena, and the quality of materials and interfaces governs the charge-to-spin conversion processes that are essential to the implementation of spintronic devices. Direct comparisons of spin parameters, which serve as metrics of device quality, obtained by different measurement techniques are scarce, leading to uncertainty regarding discrepancies and the reliability of the methods. Here, we directly compare the spin Hall coefficient (${\theta}_{SH}$) in molecular beam epitaxy grown films of $(Bi_{1-x}Sb_{x})_{2}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}$ (BSTS, x = 0.58, y = 1) at room temperature using two complementary techniques: a static method using non-local voltage (NLV) measurements in BSTS Hall bars with DC charge current, and a dynamic method using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurement in $BSTS/Ni_{80}Fe_{20}$ heterostructures at GHz frequencies. We obtain comparable spin Hall coefficients in angular-dependent ST-FMR (${\theta}_{SH}$=$4.7\pm1.1$) and in NLV (${\theta}_{SH}$=$2.8\pm0.6$). The complex effects of ferromagnetic interfaces while determining spin Hall coefficients using static or dynamic techniques becomes evident by contrasting our results to literature.

Title: Peculiarities of optical absorption spectra of NdFe$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$ crystal in magnetically ordered state and at the transition to spiral magnetic phase
Authors: V.V. Slavin, I.S. Kachur, V.S. Kurnosov, V.G. Piryatinskaya
Abstract: We study experimentally and theoretically optical absorption spectra of neodymium ferroborate in the temperature range $6-32$ K. We show that the temperature dependences of integral intensities of absorption lines demonstrate qualitatively different behavior for $\sigma$- and $\pi$-polarizations of the light. We suggest that this behavior may be caused by the appearance of a spiral magnetic structure in the compound under study. To describe the temperature dependences of lines intensities we propose a theoretical model which takes into account the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction between Nd$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ ions.

Title: Stability and Structure of Binary Metal Hydrides under Pressure, Electrochemical Potential and Combined Pressure-Electrochemistry
Authors: Mgcini Keith Phuthi, Pin-Wen Guan, Russell J. Hemley, Venkatasubramanian Viswanathan
Abstract: Metal hydrides can be tuned to have a diverse range of properties and find applications in hydrogen storage and superconductivity. Finding methods to control the synthesis of hydrides can open up new pathways to unlock novel hydride compounds with desired properties. We introduced the idea of utilizing electrochemistry as an additional tuning knob and in this work, we study the synthesis of binary metal hydrides using high pressure, electrochemistry and combined pressure-electrochemistry. Using density functional theory calculations, we predict the phase diagrams of selected transition metal hydrides under combined pressure and electrochemical conditions and demonstrate that the approach agrees well with experimental observations for most phases. We use the phase diagrams to determine trends in the stability of binary metal hydrides of scandium, yttrium and lanthanum as well as discuss the hydrogen-metal charge transfer at different pressures. Furthermore, we predict a diverse range of vanadium and chromium hydrides that could potentially be synthesized using pressure electrochemistry. These predictions highlight the value of exploring pressure-electrochemistry as a pathway to novel hydride synthesis.

Title: Ultralow-Temperature Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy Using a New Helium Flow Cryostat Stage
Authors: Young-Hoon Kim, Fehmi Sami Yasin, Na Yeon Kim, Max Birch, Xiuzhen Yu, Akiko Kikkawa, Yasujiro Taguchi, Jiaqiang Yan, Miaofang Chi
Abstract: Advances in cryogenic electron microscopy have opened new avenues for probing quantum phenomena in correlated materials. This study reports the installation and performance of a new side-entry condenZero cryogenic cooling system for JEOL (Scanning) Transmission Electron Microscopes (S/TEM), utilizing compressed liquid helium (LHe) and designed for imaging and spectroscopy at ultra-low temperatures. The system includes an external dewar mounted on a vibration-damping stage and a pressurized, low-noise helium transfer line with a remotely controllable needle valve, ensuring stable and efficient LHe flow with minimal thermal and mechanical noise. Performance evaluation demonstrates a stable base temperature of 6.58 K measured using a Cernox bare chip sensor on the holder with temperature fluctuations within 0.04 K. Complementary in-situ electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) via aluminum bulk plasmon analysis was used to measure the local specimen temperature and validate cryogenic operation during experiments. The integration of cryogenic cooling with other microscopy techniques, including electron diffraction and Lorentz TEM, was demonstrated by resolving charge density wave (CDW) transitions in NbSe2 using electron diffraction, and imaging nanometric magnetic skyrmions in MnSi via Lorentz TEM. This platform provides reliable cryogenic operation below 7 K, establishing a low-drift route for direct visualization of electronic and magnetic phase transformations in quantum materials.

Title: Unraveling the role of disorder in the electronic structure of high entropy alloys
Authors: Neeraj Bhatt, Deepali Sharma, Asif Ali, Kapil Motla, Sonika Jangid, Ravi Prakash Singh, Ravi Shankar Singh
Abstract: Disorder in high entropy alloys, arising from the random distribution of multiple elements, plays a crucial role in their novel properties desirable for various advanced engineering applications. We investigate the role of compositional and structural disorder on the electronic structure of osmium-based superconducting high entropy alloys, (Ru/Re)$_{0.35}$Os$_{0.35}$Mo$_{0.10}$W$_{0.10}$Zr$_{0.10}$, using photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT). Elemental and cumulative core level shifts are found to be commensurate with elemental electronegativities and valence electron counts (VEC), respectively. Valence band spectra together with DFT results indicate that the crystal structure plays an important role in deciding the electronic structure of these high entropy alloys. Through temperature dependent high-resolution spectra, we unveil strongly suppressed spectral density of states (SDOS) in the close vicinity of Fermi level. Energy and temperature dependence of the SDOS in accordance with Altshuler-Aronov theory confirms localization of charge carriers in the presence of strong intrinsic disorder. Computed electron-phonon coupling strength and superconducting transition temperature aligning reasonably well with experiments further shed light on phonon-mediated pairing mechanism and role of disorder in these systems. Our results provide a way forward to the understanding of superconducting high entropy alloys through strategic control of disorder, VEC and crystal structure.

Title: Stacking-Controlled Magnetic Exchange and Magnetoelectric Coupling in Bilayer CrI$_2$
Authors: B. Valdés-Toro, I. Ferreira-Araya, R. A. Gallardo, J. W. González
Abstract: We use a first-principles calculations approach to reveal the electronic and magnetic properties of chromium diiodide (CrI$_2$) bilayers and establish a hierarchy of magnetic interactions across stable registries. The monolayer presents a x-stripe antiferromagnetic ground state, while in bilayers the BA$^\prime$ stacking is the global minimum with antiparallel interlayer magnetic alignment. Bilayer configurations strengthen the exchange in the plane by 6 % to 10 %, while the exchange between layers is registry-dependent. The symmetry of each stacking configuration allows for anisotropic interactions. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya terms appear in structures without inversion symmetry, which in this case also generates in-plane polarizations of up to $\sim$ 10 $\mu$C/cm$^2$, resulting in direct magnetoelectric coupling that is absent in centrosymmetric monolayers. Thus, stacking acts both as a selector of exchange anisotropy and as a driver of magnetoelectricity. Our results show that bilayer CrI$_2$ can be mechanically reconfigured through interlayer sliding, with energy differences between stacking orders (25-50 meV/f.u.) that are compatible with experimental actuation. Tunable magnetism and register-dependent polarization offer promising opportunities for novel spintronic devices, where structural transitions can affect both magnetic states and electric dipoles.

Title: Theoretical investigation on the formation of ethylene on a gold surface
Authors: Tim Schrader, Alen Shaji, Christin David, Eva Perlt
Abstract: The targeted and efficient CO2 reduction remains an appealing option to capture CO2 from the atmosphere and transform it into value-added chemicals. The formation of methylene and subsequent dimerization to ethylene is one possible step in the rather complex pathway. These reactions typically occur on (catalytic) surfaces. It is therefore critical to gain a deeper understanding of the role of the surface. We study the reaction pathway of the dimerization on gold surfaces with varying layer thickness. The presence of support layers has a significant influence on the reaction coordinate, the energetic profile and finally on the adsorption energy of the product on the surface with interesting consequences for the role of nanostructured gold surfaces for CO2 upconversion.

Title: Non-Altermagnetic Origin of Exchange Bias Behaviors in Incoherent RuO$_2$/Fe Bilayer Heterostructures
Authors: Shelby S. Fields, Joseph C. Prestigiacomo, Cory D. Cress, Nicholas G. Combs, Olaf van 't Erve, Patrick G. Callahan, Keith E. Knipling, Michelle E. Jamer, Frank M. Abel, Feng Ye, Arianna Minelli, Zachary J. Morgan, Haile Ambaye, Masaaki Matsuda, Avishek Maity, Valeria Lauter, Steven P. Bennett
Abstract: Initially identified as a promising altermagnetic (AM) candidate, rutile RuO$_2$ has since become embroiled in controversy due to contradictory findings of modeling and measurements of the magnetic properties of bulk crystals and thin films. For example, despite observations of a bulk non-magnetic state using density functional theory, neutron scattering, and muon spin resonance measurements, patterned RuO$_2$ Hall bars and film heterostructures display magnetotransport signatures of magnetic ordering. Among the characteristics routinely cited as evidence for AM is the observation of exchange bias (EB) in an intimately contacted Fe-based ferromagnetic (FM) layer, which can arise due to interfacial coupling with a compensated antiferromagnet. Within this work, the origins of this EB coupling in Ru-capped RuO$_2$/Fe bilayers are investigated using polarized neutron diffraction, polarized neutron reflectometry, cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, and super conducting quantum interference device measurements. These experiments reveal that the EB behavior is driven by the formation of an iron oxide interlayer containing Fe$_3$O$_4$ that undergoes a magnetic transition and pins interfacial moments within Fe at low temperature. These findings are confirmed by comparable measurements of Ni-based heterostructures, which do not display EB coupling, as well as magnetometry of additional Fe/Ru bilayers that display oxide-driven EB coupling despite the absence of the epitaxial RuO$_2$ layer. While these results do not directly refute the possibility of AM ordering in RuO$_2$ thin films, they reveal that EB, and related magnetotransport phenomena, cannot alone be considered evidence of this characteristic in the rutile structure due to interfacial chemical disorder.

Title: Stability and Superconductivity of Ternary Polyhydrides
Authors: Dmitrii V. Semenok, Di Zhou, Wuhao Chen, Alexander G. Kvashnin, Andrey V. Sadakov, Toni Helm, Pedro N. Ferreira, Christoph Heil, Vladimir M. Pudalov, Ivan A. Troyan, Viktor V. Struzhkin
Abstract: We review five years of experimental and theoretical attempts (2020-2025) to enhance the superconducting critical temperature ($\textit{T$_c$}$) of hydrogen-rich compounds by alloying binary superhydrides with additional elements. Despite predictions of higher $\textit{T$_c$}$ in ternary systems such as La-Y-H, La-Ce-H, and Ca-Mg-H, experiments consistently show that the maximum $\textit{T$_c$}$ in disordered ternary superhydrides does not exceed that of the best binary parent hydrides within experimental uncertainty. Instead, alloying primarily stabilizes high-symmetry polyhydride phases at lower pressures, enabling $\textit{T$_c$}$ = 200 K near 110-120 GPa, while also improving vortex pinning and upper critical fields. Magnetic dopants suppress $\textit{T$_c$}$, whereas nonmagnetic additives leave it nearly unchanged, reminiscent of Anderson's theorem. These findings indicate that alloying is unlikely to raise $\textit{T$_c$}$, but can reduce the pressures required to stabilize high-$\textit{T$_c$}$ phases. We propose that fully ordered ternary hydrides, synthesized via controlled hydrogenation of intermetallic precursors, offer a promising route toward this goal.

Title: Robust quantum Hall resistance standard from uniform wafer-scale epitaxial graphene on SiC
Authors: François Couëdo, Chiara Mastropasqua, Aurélien Theret, Dominique Mailly, Adrien Michon, Mathieu Taupin
Abstract: We report high-precision resistance measurements on quantum Hall resistance devices fabricated from uniform epitaxial graphene grown by propane-hydrogen chemical vapor deposition on a two-inch silicon carbide substrate. Through molecular doping, we achieve a low carrier density regime ($n_\mathrm s < $ 1.5 \textperiodcentered 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$) combined with high mobility ($\upmu \geq$ 6000 cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$) at low temperature. Accurate quantization of the Hall resistance is demonstrated at magnetic flux densities as low as 3.5 T, temperatures up to 8 K, and measurement currents up to 325 $\upmu$A, with relative measurement uncertainties of a few parts per billion. A stability diagram mapping dissipation as a function of temperature and current provides insight into optimal doping conditions that maximize the breakdown current. All measurements were carried out in a pulse-tube-based cryomagnetic system, enabling simplified and continuous operation of the quantum Hall resistance standard without liquid helium consumption.

Title: Transporting Baguettes With Minimal Action: The Geometry of Optimal Nonequilibrium Processes in Stochastic Thermodynamics
Authors: Adrianne Zhong
Abstract: What are the fundamental limitations placed by the laws of thermodynamics on the energy expenditure needed to carry out a given task in a nonequilibrium environment in finite time? In this thesis, we investigate "optimal nonequilibrium processes": how nonequilibrium state changes in a thermodynamic system may be performed most efficiently, in the sense of requiring the least amount of thermodynamic work. Surprisingly, there is a hidden, fundamental geometric structure in this optimization problem that is related to the mathematics of optimal transport theory: how to optimally send, e.g., baguettes from bakeries to cafés, given supply and demand constraints, that requires the least amount of total distance traveled by the baguettes. After giving a brief overview on the mathematical framework of stochastic thermodynamics for the overdamped Langevin equation, we present a trio of works: (1) applying optimal control theory to the Fokker-Planck equation to calculate exact optimal protocols for low-dimensional systems, which reproduces the intriguing previously-discovered discontinuities in globally optimal protocols and reveals new non-monotonic optimal protocols for a certain system; (2) exploiting the importance sampling of Langevin trajectories under different protocols, to adaptively optimize protocols by controlling the thermodynamic state trajectory, which is useful for efficiently calculating free energy differences between different Hamiltonians; and finally, (3) deriving an exact geometric description of optimal nonequilibrium processes and a geodesic-counterdiabatic decomposition for the optimal protocols that enact them, which satisfyingly explains the highly non-intuitive properties of discontinuities and possible non-monotonicity in globally optimal protocols.

Title: Tunneling spectroscopy of two-dimensional superconductors with the quantum twisting microscope
Authors: Nemin Wei, Felix von Oppen, Leonid I. Glazman
Abstract: The ongoing discoveries of graphene-based superconductors underscore the quest to understand the structure of new superconducting orders. We develop a theory that facilitates the use of the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) for that purpose. This work investigates momentum-conserving tunneling across a planar junction formed by a normal monolayer graphene tip and a superconducting graphene sample within the QTM setting. We show that the bias dependence of the zero-temperature tunneling conductance exhibits singularities that provide momentum-resolved information about the Bogoliubov quasiparticle spectra, including the superconducting gap. Using a model of superconducting twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), we illustrate that simultaneously tuning the tip doping level and the tip-sample twist angle allows for measuring the momentum-resolved superconducting gap in TBG. Our results indicate that momentum-conserving tunneling spectroscopy with the QTM is a promising method for exploring superconductivity in two-dimensional van der Waals materials.

Title: Anti-hyperuniform Critical States of Active Topological Defects
Authors: Simon Guldager Andersen, Tianxiang Ma, Makito F. Katsume, Kexin Li, Xiao Liu, Martin Cramer Pedersen, Amin Doostmohammadi
Abstract: Topological defects are fundamental to the collective dynamics of non-equilibrium systems and in active matter, mediating spontaneous flows, dynamic self-organization, and emergent pattern formation. Here, we reveal critical states in active nematics, marked by slowed defect density relaxation, amplified fluctuations, and heightened sensitivity to activity. Near criticality, defect interactions become long-ranged, scaling with system size, and the system enters an anti-hyperuniform regime with giant number fluctuations of topological defects and defect clustering. This transition reflects a dual scaling behavior: fluctuations are uniform at small scales but become anti-hyperuniform at larger scales, \tm{as supported by experimental measurements on large-field-of-view endothelial monolayers. We find that these anti-hyperuniform states with multiscale defect density fluctuations are robust to varying parameters, introducing frictional damping, and changing boundary conditions.} Finally, we show that the observed anti-hyperuniformity originates from defect clustering, distinguishing this transition from defect-unbinding or phase separation processes. Beyond fundamental implications for non-equilibrium systems, these results may inform biological contexts where topological defects are integral to processes such as morphogenesis and collective cellular self-organization.

Title: Why and when merging surface nanobubbles jump
Authors: Yixin Zhang, Xiangyu Zhang, Detlef Lohse
Abstract: Gas bubble accumulation on substrates reduces the efficiency of many physicochemical processes, such as water electrolysis. For microbubbles, where buoyancy is negligible, coalescence-induced jumping driven by the release of surface energy provides an efficient pathway for their early detachment. At the nanoscale, however, gas compressibility breaks volume conservation during coalescence, suppressing surface energy release and seemingly disabling this detachment route. Using molecular dynamics simulations, continuum numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis, we show that surface nanobubbles with sufficiently large contact angles can nevertheless detach after coalescence. In this regime, detachment is powered by the release of pressure energy associated with nanobubble volume expansion. This finding thus establishes a unified driving mechanism for coalescence-induced bubble detachment across all length scales.

Title: Magnetotransport in a 2D Hybrid Band System: Dirac and Heavy Hole Interplay
Authors: G. M. Gusev, A. D. Levin, V. A. Chitta, Z. D. Kvon, N. N. Mikhailov
Abstract: We investigate magnetoresistivity and the Hall effect in a 6.3 nm gapless HgTe quantum well - a two-dimensional hybrid band system featuring coexisting linear (Dirac-like) and parabolic hole energy bands at low energies. Using a classical two-subband model that incorporates intervalley scattering, we reveal a striking tenfold enhancement of the Hall resistance, primarily driven by the dominant transport contribution of Dirac holes. A comprehensive magnetotransport analysis enables us to extract key parameters, such as the mobilities of both carrier types, thereby providing insight into their complex interplay. These results establish the HgTe quantum well as a distinctive platform for exploring novel transport phenomena in hybrid band systems and deepen our understanding of mixed-carrier magnetotransport.

Title: Augmenting knee biomechanics through programmable knitted ExoSkin orthoses
Authors: Krishma Singal, Samuel P. Kirschner, Andrew K. Schulz, Emily D. Sanders, Gregory Sawicki, Kinsey R. Herrin, Elisabetta A. Matsumoto
Abstract: A large subset of the population suffers injury or disease that causes knee pain and difficulty navigating day-to-day tasks. Off-the-shelf knee orthoses that are commonly used to treat these ailments overlook user-specific joint geometry and/or biomechanical needs. They can often be made with materials that lead to discomfort. We explore how the rich programmability of knitted fabrics can be harnessed to augment human biomechanics while promoting comfort. In this pursuit, we define \emph{ExoSkins}, a class of unpowered exoskeletons that are lightweight, comfortable, garment-like devices, and are designed based on user- and joint-specific needs. Although we foresee an expansive space for ExoSkin design (e.g., containing active materials, with sensing capabilities), in this study we focus on the interplay between knit geometry and programmable elasticity in passive orthoses as a means to augment the knee's rotational stiffness. We design geometrically-programmed ExoSkins, abbreviated \emph{G-PExos}, that capitalize on the anisotropies of four types of knitted fabric to provide high stiffness for joint torque without the need for rigid materials. Our findings indicate that G-PExos can achieve rotational stiffness of similar magnitude to off-the-shelf orthoses and can also be tuned to achieve a much broader range of rotational stiffness without sacrificing comfort to the user.

Title: Monte Carlo Diagonalization for Hubbard Model
Authors: B. Bernard, M. Charlebois
Abstract: The Hubbard model has often been studied with exact diagonalization (ED). This impurity solver is fundamentally limited by the exponential scaling of the Fock space. To address this problem, we introduce Monte Carlo diagonalization. Using a truncated Fock space constructed with a Monte Carlo approach, we reduce the size of the basis required to represent the Hamiltonian. We can then apply the Lanczos and band Lanczos algorithms in this truncated basis to find the ground state and the Green function. This results in a significant economy of resources and the capacity to break the $\sim$20-site limit of ED. Our results suggest that there is a threshold on the number of states needed to capture the physics. This allows us to reach clusters of size up to 32 sites and reproduce the expected physics.

Title: Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model in a Quantum Glassy Landscape
Authors: Surajit Bera, Jorge Kurchan, Marco Schiro
Abstract: We study a generalization of `Yukawa models' in which Majorana fermions, interacting via all-to-all random couplings as in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, are parametrically coupled to disordered bosonic degrees of freedom described by a quantum $p-$spin model. The latter has its own non-trivial dynamics leading to quantum paramagnetic (or liquid) and glassy phases. At low temperatures, this setup results in SYK behavior within each metastable state of a rugged bosonic free energy landscape, the effective fermionic couplings being different for each metastable state. We show that the boson-fermion coupling enhances the stability of the quantum spin-glass phase and strongly modifies the imaginary-time Green's functions of both sets of degrees of freedom. In particular, in the quantum spin glass phase, the imaginary-time dynamics is turned from a fast exponential decay characteristic of a gapped phase into a much slower dynamics. In the quantum paramagnetic phase, on the other hand, the fermions' imaginary-time dynamics get strongly modified and the critical SYK behavior is washed away.

Title: Machine Learning Based Optical Thermometry Using Photoluminescence and Raman Spectra of Diamonds Containing SiV Centers
Authors: Md Shakhawath Hossain, Dylan G. Stone, Dale Landry, Xiaoxue Xu, Carlo Bradac, Toan Trong Tran
Abstract: Micro- and nanothermometry enable precise temperature monitoring and control at the micro- and nanoscale, and have become essential diagnostic tools in applications ranging from high-power microelectronics to biosensing and nanomedicine. Most existing techniques rely on secondary micro- and nanothermometers that require individual calibration of each sensor, ideally both off- and in-situ, before use. We present an alternative approach that overcomes this limitation by employing fluorescent diamonds containing silicon-vacancy centers, where the thermo-sensitive physical quantities are the centers' photoluminescence and the diamond host's Raman signals. The photoluminescence and Raman data are analyzed using two multi-feature regression algorithms that leverage a minimal number of calibration diamonds and temperature set points to predict the temperature of previously unseen diamonds. Using this approach, the models achieve accuracies as low as 0.7 K, resolutions down to 0.6 K Hz$^{-1/2}$, and sensitivity as high as 0.04 K$^{-1}$. These correspond to improvements of roughly 70 percent (over threefold) in accuracy, 50 percent (twofold) in resolution, and 567 percent (sevenfold) in sensitivity compared with traditional single-feature models. Our approach is particularly suited to applications where pre-deployment calibration of every thermosensor is impractical, and it is generalizable to any thermometry platform with two or more simultaneously measurable temperature-dependent observables.

Title: Advancing Quantum Many-Body GW Calculations on Exascale Supercomputing Platforms
Authors: Benran Zhang, Daniel Weinberg, Chih-En Hsu, Aaron R. Altman, Yuming Shi, James B. White III, Derek Vigil-Fowler, Steven G. Louie, Jack R. Deslippe, Felipe H. da Jornada, Zhenglu Li, Mauro Del Ben
Abstract: Advanced ab initio materials simulations face growing challenges as increasing systems and phenomena complexity requires higher accuracy, driving up computational demands. Quantum many-body GW methods are state-of-the-art for treating electronic excited states and couplings but often hindered due to the costly numerical complexity. Here, we present innovative implementations of advanced GW methods within the BerkeleyGW package, enabling large-scale simulations on Frontier and Aurora exascale platforms. Our approach demonstrates exceptional versatility for complex heterogeneous systems with up to 17,574 atoms, along with achieving true performance portability across GPU architectures. We demonstrate excellent strong and weak scaling to thousands of nodes, reaching double-precision core-kernel performance of 1.069 ExaFLOP/s on Frontier (9,408 nodes) and 707.52 PetaFLOP/s on Aurora (9,600 nodes), corresponding to 59.45% and 48.79% of peak, respectively. Our work demonstrates a breakthrough in utilizing exascale computing for quantum materials simulations, delivering unprecedented predictive capabilities for rational designs of future quantum technologies.

Title: Hund's physics extends to actinide f electron systems
Authors: Byungkyun Kang, Roy N. Herrera-Navarro, Stephen S. Micklo, Mark R. Pederson, Eunja Kim
Abstract: Uranium 5f electrons often yield heavy-fermion behavior via Kondo screening. However, the pronounced bad-metallic transport of uranium mononitride (UN) defies an incoherent Kondo explanation. Using density-functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory, we show that UN is a strongly correlated bad metal. The dominant correlations arise from intra-atomic Hund's exchange interaction between two 5f electrons, which aligns local magnetic moments and produces large quasiparticle mass renormalization. This identifies UN as a 5f-electron analogue of a Hund's metal-a paradigm chiefly associated with transition-metal d systems. Our results motivate a re-examination of the interplay between Mott, Kondo, and Hund-driven correlations across actinide correlated materials.

Title: Correlative 3D Mapping of Structure, Composition, and Valence State Dynamics in Battery Cathodes via Simultaneous ADF-EDS-EELS Tomography
Authors: Jaewhan Oh, Sunggu Kim, Chaehwa Jeong, Jason Manassa, Jonathan Schwartz, Sangmoon Yoon, Robert Hovden, Hye Ryung Byon, Yongsoo Yang
Abstract: Understanding degradation in battery cathodes and other functional materials requires simultaneous knowledge of structural, chemical, and electronic changes in three dimensions (3D). Here, we present a simultaneous ADF-EDS-EELS tomography method that enables 3D mapping of atomic structure, composition, valence states, and transition metal inhomogeneity within a single, low-dose STEM tilt series acquisition. Applied to LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM111) particles at different electrochemical cycling stages, this method reveals nanoscale degradation processes with full spatial correlation. We observe that while chemical composition evolves uniformly throughout the entire primary particle, valence state changes and transition metal segregation are strongly depth-dependent and concentrated near the surface. This coexistence of bulk and surface-driven degradation dynamics reveals distinct mechanisms acting at different spatial scales. The evolution of inhomogeneity and valence states deviates from simple phase transition models, highlighting the roles of ion migration and dissolution-driven segregation. Our findings establish valence state gradients and nanoscale inhomogeneity as active contributors to cathode failure. More broadly, this correlative 3D platform opens new opportunities for studying redox-driven transformations in fields such as neuromorphic computing and heterogeneous catalysis, where composition-structure-function coupling is inherently three-dimensional.

Title: Delocalization Induced by Enhanced Hyperuniformity in One-Dimensional Disordered Systems
Authors: Junmo Jeon, Harukuni Ikeda, Shiro Sakai
Abstract: In one dimension, any disorder is traditionally believed to localize all states. We show that this paradigm breaks down under hyperuniform disorder, which suppresses long-wavelength fluctuations and interpolates between random and periodic potentials. In tight-binding chains, strong hyperuniformity induces a sharp delocalization transition and the emergence of mobility edges. The transition is identified by the generalized fractal dimension and corroborated by the scaling of localization length and transmittance. Hyperuniform disorder thus provides a general mechanism for engineering mobility edges and controlling transport in low dimensions.

Title: Evanescent-mode-assisted Klein tunneling in dual-gated bilayer graphene
Authors: Yupeng Huang, W. Zeng
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the electron tunneling in dual-gated bilayer graphene-based $n/p$ junctions. It is shown that a band gap is introduced by tuning the gate voltage, which modifies the pseudospin polarization and breaks anti-Klein tunneling at normal incidence. Specifically, when the pseudospin polarization vectors for the propagating and evanescent wave modes on the left and right regions of the junction are orthogonal, a revival of Klein tunneling is achieved. The Berry phase associated with Klein tunneling in dual-gated bilayer graphene is not limited to $\pi$ but varies with the junction parameters. Furthermore, the Klein tunneling is accompanied by a $\pi$ jump in the reflection phase around the normal incidence.

Title: Noncollinear Magnetic Multipoles in Collinear Altermagnets
Authors: Luca Buiarelli, Rafael M. Fernandes, Turan Birol
Abstract: Altermagnets host an array of magnetic multipoles, which are often visualized and studied in the reciprocal space. In the real space, the relative phase of the multipoles of the spin-density around atoms determines whether a system is an altermagnet or a conventional antiferromagnet. In this study, we approach these real space multipoles in altermagnets using a combination of first principles calculations and group theory. We show that even in collinear magnets, the local spin density is necessarily noncollinear due to spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, the noncollinear contributions often provide a more direct illustration of the magnetic multipolar character of altermagnetism than the collinear contribution, which is dominated by the dipolar term. Our first principles calculations also show that 32-poles, in addition to the octupoles, can be visible in spin-density of d-wave altermagnets, and they must be taken into account in discussions of the macroscopic response. Finally, we elucidate the interplay between magnetism and subtle crystal structural distortions in perovskite altermagnets, which provide a fertile playground for studying phase transitions between antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic phases.

Title: Superconductivity at 22.3 K in Compressed Sodium-intercalated Graphite
Authors: Ming-Xing Huang, Yuan-Qing Liu, Chun-Mei Hao, Xi Shao, Tingwei An, Guochun Yang, Yufei Gao, Shaojie Wang, Lin Wang, Bo Xu, Feng Ke, Xiang-Feng Zhou, Yongjun Tian
Abstract: Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) have long been recognized as promising candidates for high-temperature superconductivity by intercalation or charge doping, yet experimental progress has stalled with transition temperatures (Tc) limited to 11.5 K at ambient pressure and 15.1 K at 7.5 GPa in calcium-intercalated graphite over decades. Here, we report robust superconductivity in sodium-intercalated graphite with Tc of 22.3 K, as demonstrated by clear zero-resistance behavior. Our approach involves simply room-temperature grinding of graphite with sodium, followed by slight compression up to 7.1 GPa, circumventing complex synthesis procedures. Through synchrotron X-ray diffraction combined with first-principles calculations, we identify the major superconducting phase as an orthorhombic stage-2 GIC structure with slightly over-stoichiometric composition (Na1+xC8). Electron-phonon coupling calculations reveal that superconductivity primarily emerges from the interactions between out-of-plane carbon electrons and low-frequency Na/C this http URL enhancement in Tc establishes sodium as superior for achieving higher-Tc in GICs and illustrates promising pathway for further optimization through compositional and structural tuning.

Abstract: We explore the Mott insulating phases of dual-species bosonic spinor lattice gases, emphasizing the intriguing interplay between synthetic flux and inter-species spin exchange interaction. One of the species is subjected to Raman assisted tunneling, which leads to a synthetic flux within the framework of synthetic dimensions. In the deep Mott regime, the low energy physics is governed by an unconventional and highly tunable spin model, which is characterized by two distinct spin chains. The synthetic flux serves as an effective spin-orbit coupling, inducing Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in one of the spin chains. The inter-species spin exchange interaction gives rise to the inter-chain coupling embodied as an isotropic XX interaction. Using time-evolving block decimation method for tensor network states, we compute order parameters, correlation functions and structure factors to identify the ground state magnetic phases. The DM interaction in one species, when combined with the inter-species spin-exchange interaction, can induce spiral magnetic order in the second, otherwise non-chiral species. Besides, the interplay of a transverse field applied to one spin chain and the inter-species coupling can drive both spin chains into a paramagnetic phase simultaneously. These results reveal that inter-species coupling serves as a powerful conduit for transmitting magnetic correlations, enabling exotic phases beyond the single-component perspective.

Title: Nonreciprocal interactions induce persistent active clusters in binary colloids
Authors: Shoma Hara, Masazumi Okada, Keisuke Kittaka, Sho Tanami, Yuichi Iwasaki, Hiroaki Ishikawa, Kiwamu Yoshii, Yutaka Sumino
Abstract: We study binary colloids under AC electric fields, where electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flows generate nonreciprocal interactions. Mixing particles of different sizes produces self-propelled pairs that fragment and reassemble into persistent active clusters, unlike the static crystallization of single-sized systems. Agent-based and continuum models reproduce these dynamics and identify two key mechanisms: asymmetric pair propulsion and spray-like fission from excluded-volume polarity. These results establish a minimal, controllable platform for exploring nonreciprocal active matter and highlight nonreciprocity as a general route to engineer reconfigurable colloidal assemblies.

Title: Non-Hermitian topological superconductivity with symmetry-enriched spectral and eigenstate features
Authors: Chuo-Kai Chang, Kazuma Saito, Nobuyuki Okuma, Hsien-Chung Kao, Chen-Hsuan Hsu
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional superconducting lattice that realizes all internal symmetries permitted in non-Hermitian systems, characterized by nonreciprocal hopping, onsite dissipation, and $s$-wave singlet pairing in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type structure. The combined presence of pseudo-Hermiticity and sublattice symmetry imposes constraints on the energy spectra. We identify parameter regimes featuring real spectra, purely imaginary spectra, complex flat bands, and Majorana zero modes, the latter emerging when a uniform transverse magnetic field suppresses the non-Hermitian skin effect. We show that a uniform onsite dissipation is essential for stabilizing the zero modes, whereas a purely staggered dissipation destroys the topological superconductivity. Through Hermitianization, we construct a spectral winding number as a topological invariant and demonstrate its correspondence with the gap closing conditions and appearance of the Majorana zero modes, allowing us to establish topological phase diagrams. Moreover, we reveal nontrivial correlations between the particle-hole and spin components of left and right eigenstates, enforced by chiral symmetry, pseudo-Hermiticity, and their combination. Our results highlight how non-Hermiticity, sublattice structure, and superconductivity together enrich symmetry properties and give rise to novel topological phenomena.

Title: Thermally Activated Plasticity in Single-Crystal Titanium: A Molecular Dynamics Study of Nanoscale Deformation
Authors: G. Markovic, F. J. Dominguez-Gutierrez
Abstract: Hexagonal close-packed (hcp) titanium exhibits a complex temperature-dependent mechanical response that is central to its use in structural applications. We employ large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the nanoindentation behavior of single-crystalline a-Ti along the [0001], [10-10], and [2-110] orientations at 10, 300, and 600 K. The simulations reveal how temperature modifies the onset of plasticity and the subsequent evolution of dislocation activity, including nucleation, glide, and the competition between basal and pyramidal <c+a> slip. Schmid factor mapping establishes a direct correlation between the orientation-dependent activation of slip systems and the resolved shear stress fields beneath the indenter. The results demonstrate a pronounced increase in thermally assisted dislocation motion with temperature, which manifests as diffuse slip traces and less localized pile-up patterns. Surface morphologies obtained at 300 K are consistent with atomic force microscopy observations, validating the atomistic modeling approach. At elevated temperatures, enhanced dislocation recovery and redistribution of slip pathways dominate the indentation response, highlighting the role of thermal activation in controlling plasticity in hcp titanium.

Title: Selective nonthermal melting in phlogopite under ultrafast energy deposition
Authors: Nikita Medvedev
Abstract: Phlogopite is a complex magnesium-rich mineral from the dark mica group, KMg$_3$(AlSi$_3$O$_{10}$)(OH)$_2$. Its response to ultrafast excitation of its electronic system is studied using a hybrid model that combines tight-binding molecular dynamics with transport Monte Carlo and the Boltzmann equation. Simulations predict that at the deposited dose of ~0.17 eV/atom (electronic temperature $T_e$~11,000 K), the first hydrogens start to migrate in the otherwise preserved lattice, transiently turning mica into a superionic state. At the dose of ~0.4 eV/atom ($T_e$~13,000 K), Mg atoms start to diffuse like a liquid within stable sublattices of other elements, suggesting a superionic-superionic phase transition. At a dose of approximately 0.5 eV/atom ($T_e$~14,000 K), the entire atomic lattice destabilizes, disordering on picosecond timescale. It is accompanied by the formation of defect energy levels inside the bandgap. At the doses ~0.9 eV/atom ($T_e$~16,000 K), the bandgap completely collapses, turning the material metallic (electronically conducting). At even higher doses, nonthermal acceleration of atoms heats the atomic system at ultrafast timescales; K and O elements are most affected, accelerating within a few tens of femtoseconds.

Title: Replication and Information Extraction in a Minimal Agent-Environment Model
Authors: Sebastiano Ariosto, Jerome Garnier-Brun, Luca Saglietti, Davide Straziota
Abstract: We consider an unsupervised classifying agent that evolves by enforcing self-consistency of its labels under continual exposure to a data-generating environment. Because the agent's predictions feed back into its own regularized updates, the dynamics can stabilize into self-sustaining modes of operation, which we coin functional replicators. Remarkably, such replicators can spontaneously align with the latent structure of the environment, despite never being exposed to ground-truth labels or selected for adaptation. Using analytical tools from statistical mechanics and numerical experiments, we show that the onset of this regime corresponds to a transition driven by weak correlations between the agent's initial state and environmental structure. Extending the model to multiple agents, we find that their mutual influence can spontaneously break symmetry and produce consensus, illustrating a minimal setting for decentralized collective learning.

Title: Evidence of electronic instability driven structural distortion in the nodal line semimetal CoSn$_2$
Authors: Suman Nandi, Bishal Maity, Shovan Dan, Khadiza Ali, Bikash Patra, Anshuman Mondal, Gaston Garbarino, Pierre Rodière, Sitaram Ramakrishnan, Bahadur Singh, Arumugam Thamizhavel
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms that drive spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking in correlated electron systems is a central challenge in condensed matter physics. Although such symmetry breaking phases have been studied in low-dimensional and strongly correlated materials, its emergence in structurally simpler compounds remains less explored. Here, we investigate non-magnetic CoSn$_2$ that is a centrosymmetric intermetallic compound crystallizing in a tetragonal structure at ambient conditions, and discover an electronically driven symmetry breaking instability. Electrical resistivity reveals a distinct change in the slope below 25 K, deviating from the expected Bloch-Grüneisen behavior. This anomaly is attributed towards a structural change as at 22 K single crystal X-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation uncovers weak superlattice reflections that leads to a doubling of $\textbf{a}$ and $\textbf{c}$, resulting in a 4-fold superstructure. The symmetry of the lattice reduces from tetragonal to acentric monoclinic but without any discernible monoclinic distortion down to 10 K. This structural transition is accompanied by a twofold symmetry in angular magnetoresistance, contrasting the fourfold symmetry observed at higher temperatures. First-principles calculations show no phonon softening but reveal enhanced electronic susceptibility, suggesting an electronic instability. Polarization-dependent ARPES measurements further identify a strong orbital anisotropy dominated by the in-plane Co-$d_{xy}$ states. Collectively, our results point to an electronic instability driven structural distortion in CoSn$_2$, offering a rare platform to study symmetry breaking in a non-magnetic metallic system.

Title: A Non-Equilibrium Dissipation Parameter and the Ideal Glass
Authors: Jun-Ying Jiang, Liang Gao, Hai-Bin Yu
Abstract: Glass materials, as quintessential non-equilibrium systems, exhibit properties such as energy dissipation that are highly sensitive to their preparation histories. A key challenge has been identifying a unified order parameter to rationalize these properties. Here, we demonstrate that a configurational distance metric can effectively collapse energy dissipation data across diverse preparation histories and testing protocols, including varying cooling rates, aging processes, probing times, and the amplitudes of mechanical excitation, as long as the temperature remains above the so-called ideal glass transition (where the extrapolated structural relaxation time diverges). Our results provide a unified description for the non-equilibrium dissipation and suggest that the putative concept of the ideal glass transition is imprinted in material characteristics

Title: Symmetric Lévy flights in semi-infinite domain
Authors: Barnali Pyne, Kiran M. Kolwankar
Abstract: We study symmetric Lévy flights in a semi-infinite domain $[0,\infty)$ with a reflecting and absorbing boundary at 0. To this end, we use the fractional differential equation that governs the Lévy process. Incorporating the boundary conditions in Lévy flights has been an open and tricky question, as the long jumps can lead to the Lévy flights leaping over the boundary. We, for the first time, incorporate reflecting and absorbing boundary conditions for Lévy flights and solve the fractional differential equation analytically to find the probability densities. Monte Carlo simulations are also performed for both boundary conditions to verify the results. Analytical and simulation results perfectly coincide for the reflecting boundary condition and, for the absorbing boundary condition, they coincide for the large abscissa values.

Title: Entanglement signatures of gapless topological phases in a $p$-wave superconductor
Authors: S. Srinidhi, Shashi C. L. Srivastava, Jayendra N. Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: We explore the gapless topological phases of a $p$-wave superconductor, probing its rich topologically ordered phases and underlying quantum phenomena. The topological order of the system is characterized by studying its entanglement properties. This study confirms the bulk-boundary correspondence in the entanglement spectrum, even without a full bulk gap. For contractible bipartitions, the entanglement entropy varies non-monotonically with the chemical potential, displaying pronounced peaks at points where the bulk gap closes and reopens, signaling topological quantum phase transitions. This behavior remains robust in the thermodynamic limit. The entanglement entropy grows with system size for non-contractible bipartitions, indicating long-range entanglement in the gapless phase. These findings reveal the subtle interplay between symmetry, entanglement, and topology in gapless systems, and emphasize the role of entanglement-based diagnostics in identifying unconventional topological phases beyond the gapped paradigm.

Title: Geometric Frustration Directs the Self-Assembly of Nanoparticles with Crystallized Ligand Bundles
Authors: Federico Tomazic, Aswathy Muttathukattil, Afshin Nabiyan, Felix Schacher, Michael Engel
Abstract: Polymer-grafted nanoparticles are versatile building blocks that self-assemble into a rich diversity of mesostructures. Coarse-grained molecular simulations have commonly accompanied experiments by resolving structure formation pathways and predicting phase behavior. Past simulations represented nanoparticles as spheres and the ligands as flexible chains of beads, isotropically tethered to the nanoparticles. Here, we investigate a different minimal coarse-grained model. The model consists of an attractive rod tethered to a repulsive sphere. The motivation of this rod-sphere model is to describe nanospheres with a partially crystallized, stretched polymeric bundle, as well as other complex building blocks such as rigid surfactants and end-tethered nanorods. Varying the ratio of sphere size to rod radius stabilizes self-limited clusters and other mesostructures of reduced dimensionality. The complex phase behavior we observe is a consequence of geometric frustration.

Title: Passive polymers in active turbulence undergo a collapse-stretch transition
Authors: Zahra K. Valei, Davide Marenduzzo, Tyler N. Shendruk
Abstract: Active processes in living systems generate nonequilibrium forces that deform embedded passive macromolecules. To understand how such dynamics influence polymer conformation, we study a flexible passive chain in an active nematic fluid. Using hybrid simulations, we uncover a length-dependent transition in polymer behavior: long chains align with and stretch along defect-driven flows, while short chains bend and collapse due to localized stresses. These responses are controlled by a competition between the polymer size and the emergent length scale of the active turbulence. Our results reveal a defect-mediated mechanism for conformational control and point toward general physical principles for designing responsive soft materials that couple passive structure to active dynamics.

Title: Energetics and thermodynamics of bilayer rectangular artificial spin ices
Authors: Gabriel A. Oliveira (1), Winder A. Moura-Melo (1), Afranio R. Pereira (1), Fabio S. Nascimento (2) ((1) Departamento de Física, Universidade Federal de Viçosa, 36570-900, Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, (2) Centro de Formação de Professores, Universidade Federal do Recôncavo da Bahia, 45300-000, Amargosa, Bahia, Brazil)
Abstract: Bilayer rectangular artificial spin ices (BRASIs) with distinct aspect ratios, $\gamma$, are considered. Namely, we investigate how the underlying geometry modifies the interaction between two rectangular artificial spin ice layers separated by a height offset, $h$, whenever compared to the square case. Actually, rectangular layers interact by means of a Buckingham-like potential, whereas in the square case, one has an algebraic (van der Walls-like) interaction. In addition, Moiré patterns for BRASIs are less definite than for the square bilayer. We also deal with their basic thermodynamics, showing the behavior of the specific heat as a function of temperature and $\gamma$ for a number of height offsets.

Title: Splitting of electronic spectrum in paramagnetic phase of itinerant ferromagnets and altermagnets
Authors: A. A. Katanin
Abstract: We study self-energy effects, induced by strong magnetic fluctuations in paramagnetic phase of strongly-correlated itinerant magnets within the density functional theory combined with the dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT approach) and its non-local extension. As concrete examples, we consider $\alpha$-iron, half metal CrO$_2$, van der Waals material CrTe$_2$, and altermagnet CrSb. We show that both local and non-local magnetic correlations yield splitting of the electronic spectrum in the paramagnetic phase, such that it closely resembles the DFT band structure in the ordered phase and suppresses spectral weight at the Fermi level. The relative importance of non-local vs. local correlations depends on the proximity to half filling of $d$ states: closer to half filling, the role of local correlations increases. Although the obtained split bands do not possess a certain spin projection, their splitting suppresses spectral weight at the Fermi level. The obtained electronic states are also expected to be easily spin polarized by a weak external magnetic field.

Title: Magnetic-field dependent vortex dynamics and critical currents in superconducting microwires with regular large-area perforation by pinholes
Authors: Dong Zhu, Ilya Charaev, Konstantin Ilin, Andreas Schilling
Abstract: We report on results of simulations and experiments of vortex states in superconducting micro-wires with periodic rectangular pinhole structures. The simulations have been performed by means of numerically solving the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations. With increasing bias current and for different values of the external magnetic field applied normal to the structure plane, we observe at first a vortex free Meissner state, followed by a resistive vortex-flow mixed state and a state with a more complex vortex pattern. The resulting dependence of the critical current Ic on magnetic field exhibits two plateaus with distinctly different vortex dynamics. Corresponding experimentally measured magnetic-field dependences of Ic of WSi microwires with periodic pinhole structures and varying hole spacing confirmed the predictions of these simulations, showing two ranges of magnetic field with almost field-independent critical currents. The experimentally determined critical currents are larger for a smaller pinhole spacing, in agreement with the results of the TDGL simulations. The good agreement of the simulations with the experimental results provides a convenient strategy for the optimization of single-photon detectors with or without artificial and natural defects.

Title: A DNA-encoded recipe to direct multi-stage colloidal assembly
Authors: Pepijn G. Moerman, Chenghung Chou, Thomas E. Videbæk, W. Benjamin Rogers, Rebecca Schulman
Abstract: In equilibrium self-assembly, microscopic building blocks spontaneously self-organize into stable structures as dictated by their interaction potentials, which limits the accessible structural features to those that correspond to global minima in free energy landscapes; they are often ordered and periodic on length scales comparable to the building block size. Coupling the assembly process to an exergonic reaction drives the system out of equilibrium so that an assembly pathway can be engineered to target a specific kinetically stabilized state, which in principle opens up a vast design space with access to diverse complex structures with features on multiple length scales. However, the question of how such features might be specifically targeted remains unanswered. Here, we explore this design space using a DNA-encoded recipe consisting of multiple biomolecular reactions that dictate the time-dependent binding strength and specificity of each type of subunit in the sample independently, which makes it possible to program an assembly pathway that leads to a kinetically trapped final state. With this kinetic control, we show that the same set of building blocks can form clusters with different final structures. These structures, with tunable core-shell compositions, have feature sizes much larger than the building block size and are governed by the DNA-encoded assembly kinetics. Contrasting global kinetic control strategies such as thermal annealing, tuning the timing of individual biomolecular reactions offers the opportunity to regulate how the activity of each separate co-assembling component of a large set varies over time, opening up the potential for morphogenesis-like assembly processes involving engineered species.

Title: Trace Element Behavior during Shock Transformation of Zircon to Reidite
Authors: A. A. Shiryaev, A. N. Zhukov, V. V. Yakushev, A. A. Averin, V. O. Yapaskurt, A. Yu. Borisova, A. Yu. Bychkov, O. G. Safonov, I. V. Lomonosov
Abstract: Large single crystals of natural zircon were shock-loaded at 13.6 and 51.3 GPa in planar geometry. No structural changes were observed after loading at 13.6 GPa. Loading to 51.3 GPa resulted in zircon transformation to a denser scheelite-structured phase, reidite. The investigation of reidite samples by X-ray diffraction, Raman, photo- and cathodoluminescence spectroscopies revealed segregation of some trace cations (such as REE) on planar defects during the transformation. The segregation has occurred in a laboratory experiment without long-term annealing after the shock loading. A possible mechanism of the segregation of trivalent trace cations assumes local violation of charge balance during the zircon-reidite reconstructive transformation, which is accompanied by changes in the topology of polyhedra and second coordination spheres (Si-Zr). This results in expulsion of a fraction of the trace elements into energetically expensive interstitial positions with high diffusivity even at relatively low temperatures.

Title: Accelerating Crystal Structure Prediction Using Data-Derived Potentials: High-Pressure Binary Hydrides
Authors: Lewis J. Conway, Chris J. Pickard
Abstract: Crystal structures can be predicted from first-principles using ab initio random structure searching AIRSS and density functional theory (DFT). AIRSS provides a method to sample the potential energy landscape and DFT provides a robust and accurate description of that landscape. Classical interatomic potentials can describe energy landscapes at a significantly lower computational cost, typically at the expense of robustness and accuracy. Modern machine-learning interatomic potentials offer a compromise, with greater robustness and accuracy than classical potentials at a fraction of the computational cost of DFT. In this work, we use Ephemeral Data-Derived Potentials EDDPs to perform accelerated AIRSS calculations for the binary hydrides at 100 GPa. Since the training data is generated iteratively using AIRSS, the searches can be performed with no prior knowledge of hydrides. These potentials allow for more diverse searches, sampling a wider range of compositions, larger unit cells, and orders-of-magnitude more structures. In addition to recovering many of the known structures, the searches reveal structures such as the hydrogen-rich phases of H$_{22}$(BrH), H$_{23}$Pb, and H$_{32}$Mg, supermolecular phases of H$_{25}$Cs and H$_{26}$Rn, and many substoichiometric variants of known hydrides. Our results indicate that using the current generation of pretrained universal MLIPs to search for novel high-pressure hydrides is less effective due to model instabilities or markedly slower inference speeds and highlight the necessity of generating new, targeted data to drive further discoveries.

Title: Revealing a hidden magnetic order in the triangular lattice antiferromagnet CuNdO$_2$
Authors: Jonathan Gaudet, Dalmau Reig-i-Plessis, Bogeng Wen, Thomas J. Hicken, Jonas A. Krieger, Jan Peter Embs, Hubertus Luetkens, Adam A. Aczel, Stuart A. Calder, Matthew B. Stone, Hae-Young Kee, Alannah M. Hallas
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic ground state of CuNdO$_2$, which is a delafossite with a triangular lattice of magnetic Nd$^{3+}$ ions that are well separated by non-magnetic Cu spacer layers. From inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the crystal electric field, we determine the strong Ising character of the pseudo-spin $\frac{1}{2}$ Nd$^{3+}$ moments. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements reveal the onset of long-range antiferromagnetic order at $T_N=0.78$ K. While the magnetic transition is definitively observed with muon spin relaxation, accompanied by the formation of a weakly dispersing spin wave excitation, no dipole-ordered moment is detected with neutron diffraction. We show that the apparent absence of a dipolar ordered moment is a consequence of the dominant Ising character of the Nd$^{3+}$ moments, which experience extreme frustration on the triangular lattice. Consequently, the frustration in CuNdO$_2$ is relieved through in-plane ordering of the substantially smaller perpendicular component of the Nd$^{3+}$ moments into a 120\textdegree\ structure, with a nearly vanishing ordered moment.

Title: Phase transitions and polarization switching in quasi-one-dimensional organic ferroelectrics of phenyltetrazole family
Authors: A.P.Moina
Abstract: Pseudospin models are proposed for description of the phase transitions, dielectric characteristics, and polarization switching in two crystals of the phenyltetrazole family. One of them, APHTZ, is a canted ferroelectric, whereas the other, MPHTZ is a simple antiferroelectric. In APHTZ the electric field, applied perpendicularly to the axis of spontaneous polarization, flips the polarization in one of the two sublattices, effectively rotating the non-zero net polarization by 90$^\circ$ and switching the system between two different ferroelectric configurations. The temperature-electric field phase diagrams are constructed. The diagram topology appears to be typical for the Ising-like antiferroelectric systems.

Title: DFT prediction of new o-MAX phases: Mo2A2AlC3 (A = Zr, Nb, Ta) for next-generation thermal barrier coatings
Authors: M. I. A. Tanim, C. Talukder, S. S. Saif, Labib H. K. Adnan, N. Jahan, M. M. Hossain, M. M. Uddin, M. A. Ali
Abstract: The incorporation of o-MAX phases, characterized by out-of-plane atomic arrangements, provides valuable extensions to the MAX phase family, driven by their superior thermomechanical properties, which are suitable for high-temperature applications. In this research, three novel o-MAX phases, Mo2A2AlC3 (A = Zr, Nb, Ta), have been newly explored, and their structural geometry, electronic properties, mechanical behavior, thermodynamic characters, and optical response have been comprehensively investigated employing density functional theory (DFT) for the first time.

Title: Fabrication of oxide/FeSe multilayer films using the PLD technique
Authors: Tomoki Kobayashi, Hiroki Nakagawa, Ryo Ogawa, Atsutaka Maeda
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate the successful fabrication of TiO2/FeSe/STO and TiO2/FeSe/LaAlO3 heterostructures using PLD. When the growth rates were sufficiently low, anatase TiO2, which has been reported to induce superconductivity in FeSe, could be grown epitaxially on FeSe. For TiO2/FeSe/STO, the FeSe/TiO2 interface was relatively clean, as confirmed by the observation of Laue fringes in FeSe(001) reflection. Although a thinner FeSe layer is expected to enhance Tc, our results instead suggest that deposition of TiO2 introduces additional disorder in FeSe. Most strikingly, superconductivity appeared when TiO2 was deposited on FeSe/LaAlO3, clearly demonstrating that the interaction between the top oxide layer and underlying FeSe can induce superconductivity. This work demonstrates the feasibility of fabricating FeSe/oxide superlattices by PLD, establishing a novel platform for the exploration of interfacial superconductivity in iron-based superconductors.

Title: Chiral Analogues of Knit Stitches Designed Using Chiral Topology
Authors: Shunsuke Takano, Yusuke Kochi, Ken'ichi Yoshida, Elisabetta A. Matsumoto, Yuka Kotorii, Toru Asahi, Katsuya Inoue
Abstract: Fabrics are flexible thin structures made of entangled yarn or fibers, yet the topological bases of their mechanics remain poorly understood. For weft knitted fabrics, we describe how the entanglement of adjacent stitches contributes to the flexibility of the fabric. Interpreting heterogeneous stitch pairs as domain boundaries reveals that the step between pairs of neighboring stitches is responsible for direction-specific flexibility. In typical knitted fabrics, anisotropic flexibility can be attributed to latticed domain boundaries. The intersections between domain boundaries result in point defects that induce frustration that resembles the impossible Penrose stairs. We identify these by a chiral characteristic, defined summing the ascending or descending steps in a cycle surrounding the defect. Remarkably, seed fabric, a knit with high flexibility in both course and wale directions, is characterized as a racemic crystal of these chiral point defects.

Title: Tunable quantum metric and band topology in bilayer Dirac model
Authors: Xun-Jiang Luo, Xing-Lei Ma, K. T. Law
Abstract: Quantum metric, a fundamental component of quantum geometry, has attracted broad interest in recent years due to its critical role in various quantum phenomena. Meanwhile, band topology, which serves as an important framework in condensed matter physics, has led to the discovery of various topological phases. In this work, we introduce a bilayer Dirac model that allows precise tuning of both properties. Our approach combines two Dirac Hamiltonians with distinct energy scales; one producing relatively dispersive bands and the other yielding relatively flat bands. The dispersive and flat bands are weakly coupled via hybridization $\lambda$. By inducing a band inversion in the layer subspace, we achieve flexible tuning of band topology across all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes and quantum metric scaling as $g \propto 1/\lambda^2$ near band inversion point. Using the bilayer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we investigate the localization properties of gapless boundary states, which are affected by quantum metric. Our work lays a foundation for exploring the interplay between band topology and quantum metric.

Title: Tetratomic states of microwave dressed and associated ultracold 23Na40K molecules
Authors: Zhengyu Gu, Xuansheng Zhou, Wei Chen, Wei Han, Fulin Deng, Tao Shi, Pengjun Wang, Jing Zhang
Abstract: Ultracold diatomic molecules have achieved significant breakthroughs in recent years, enabling the exploration of quantum chemistry, precision measurements, and strongly correlated many-body physics. Extending ultracold molecular complexity to polyatomic molecules, such as triatomic and tetratomic molecules, has attracted considerable interest. However, the realization of ultracold polyatomic molecules remains technically challenging due to their complex energy-level structures. While only a few experiments have successfully demonstrated the formation of polyatomic molecules by magnetoassociation or electroassociation, here we present the first step toward producing tetratomic molecules through the development of a microwave association technique combined with microwave dressing. When the two lowest rotational states of the molecules are dressed by a microwave field, weakly bound tetramer states emerge in the entrance channel with free dark excited states $\ket{0}$ and a dressed state $\ket{+}$. The spectroscopy of these weakly bound tetramers is probed by another microwave field that drives transitions from the populated dressed states $\ket{+}$. By precisely discriminating the complex hyperfine structure of the dark excited level $\ket{0}$ from the dressed-state spectroscopy, the binding energy of the tetratomic molecules is measured and characterized. Our work contributes to the understanding of complex few-body physics within a system of microwave-dressed molecules and may open an avenue toward the creation and control of ultracold polyatomic molecules.

Title: Twist-Free Enhancement of Strength and Modulus in Electrospun Yarns via Liquid-Assisted Capillary Densification
Authors: Saujatya Mandal, Sonu Dhiman, Debashish Das
Abstract: Electrospun yarns often fall short of the strength and stiffness of their constituent nanofibers because of loose packing and inter-fiber slip. We report a simple, twist-free route to close this gap by liquid-assisted rolling: yarns are briefly wetted (water or ethanol) and subjected to gentle rolling action (mechanical strokes perpendicular and parallel to the yarn axis), then dried under controlled conditions so that meniscus forces compact the assembly into tightly bound bundles. The treatment yields large gains in tensile strength and modulus, and as yarn diameter decreases the properties of liquid-treated yarns approach single-fiber limits, indicating more efficient load transfer. Dry-rolling controls produce negligible changes compared to as-spun yarns, confirming that capillarity-driven consolidation, rather than mechanical pressing, dominates the improvement. Water consistently outperforms ethanol, reflecting its larger elastocapillary driving term gamma*(1 + cos theta) on PAN and thus stronger capillary compaction; a short post-treatment anneal near Tg further increases stiffness with a corresponding reduction in ductility. To rationalize these trends, we quantify microstructure via SEM-derived alignment and packing density and show that these complementary descriptors jointly explain variability in mechanical response. A compact constitutive framework, grounded in distributed fiber recruitment and adhesion/frictional contact, captures the observed strengthening-ductility trade-off across processing routes. The results establish capillarity-driven consolidation as a scalable pathway to engineer processing-structure-property relationships in hierarchical polymer fiber assemblies and provide practical guidance for upgrading electrospun yarns, alone or as precursors to twisted and composite architectures.

Title: Novel Market Temperature Definition Through Fluctuation Theorem: A Statistical Physics Framework for Financial Crisis Prediction
Authors: Masoome Ramezani, Fereydoun Rahnama Roodposhti, Ghanbar Abbaspour Esfeden, Mehdi Ramezani
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to financial crisis prediction by establishing a thermodynamic-like framework derived from the fluctuation theorem of statistical physics. We define market temperature through the probability ratio of positive to negative returns and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying market states and predicting potential crises. Our empirical analysis spans nine major global indices from 2005 to 2025, revealing statistically significant differences in temperature dynamics between crisis and non-crisis periods. Most notably, we discover a counterintuitive relationship between market temperature stability and crisis occurrence: crises tend to emerge more frequently during periods of apparent temperature stability rather than instability. This finding suggests that unusually stable periods in market temperature might signal the accumulation of systemic risks, similar to the calm before a storm in physical systems.

Title: Field-free superconducting diode effect of NbSe2 induced by strain
Authors: Jiajun Li, Minhao Zou, Fengyi Guo, Dai Zheng, Yiying Zhang, Yu Du, Fuwei Zhou, Heng Zhang, Wuyi Qi, Tianqi Wang, YeFan Yu, Rui Wang, Fucong Fei, Hao Geng, Fengqi Song
Abstract: Superconducting diodes, similar to semiconductor diodes, possess unidirectional superconducting properties and are the fundamental units for constructing superconducting quantum computing, thus attracting widespread attention. At present, most of superconducting diodes require an external magnetic field or proximity effect to break time reversal symmetry (TRS). The cases of intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) under zero magnetic field are relatively scarce, and there are still some puzzles especially regarding the reasons for the TRS breaking. Here, we not only report field free SDE in NbSe2 induced by strain, but also large values of the difference of Ic+ and |Ic-| ({\Delta}Ic) of 286 {\mu}A and the superconducting diode efficiency ({\eta}) of 6.76 % are achieved. Interestingly, {\Delta}Ic varies with the magnetic field and exhibits two distinct evolutionary behaviors with B-odd or B-even symmetry in various devices. We attribute this to the selective activation of two independent, spatially-orthogonal mechanisms: a stress-induced real-space polarity and a field-induced reciprocal-space asymmetric energy bands. In general, we propose an extremely effectively method to produce field free SDE, even when the material itself does not possess field free SDE, and provide new perspectives to understand the SDE which build new avenues for superconducting quantum devices.

Title: Power-Law Spectra and Asymptotic $ω/T$ Scaling in the Orbital-Selective Mott Phase of a Three-Orbital Hubbard Model
Authors: Fabian Eickhoff
Abstract: Quantum materials whose properties lie beyond the celebrated Landau Fermi-liquid paradigm have been observed for decades across diverse material platforms. Finding microscopic lattice models for metallic states that exhibit such peculiar behavior remains a major theoretical challenge, as these features often originate from strong quantum fluctuations in strongly interacting electron systems. Here we investigate a three-orbital Hubbard model at a high-symmetry point that hosts a transition from a metallic to an orbital-selective Mott (OSM) phase. Employing single-site dynamical mean-field theory combined with full-density-matrix numerical renormalization group, we chart the $T-U$ phase diagram and obtain high-resolution real-frequency dynamics. In the OSM regime we find asymptotically scale-invariant (power-law) single-particle spectra and asymptotic $\omega/T$ scaling in both charge and spin channels, spanning several decades in frequency and temperature.

Abstract: Polar metals are an underexplored material class combining two properties that are typically incompatible, namely a polar crystal structure and reasonable electrical conductivity. While intriguing given that metals favor centrosymmetry, these materials also exhibit potential functional properties relevant to memory, optoelectronic, catalytic, and other applications. The distortive polar metal (DPM) subclass forms through a centrosymmetry-lifting phase transformation into a polar crystal structure. In the process, domains with uniform geometric polar directions form, oftentimes separated by domain boundaries with polarity discontinuities arranged in "charged" head-to-head (H-H) or tail-to-tail (T-T) morphologies. To date, only metallic oxide DPM microstructures have been studied. Here we reveal in the intermetallic DPM Mn5Al8 different chemical reactivity and surface interactions at domain boundaries depending on their H-H or T-T character. Variable surface electron-transfer reactivity suggests localized changes in electronic work functions due to an increase (H-H) or depletion (T-T) in the electronic density of states. This behavior is unintuitive in a metal where electrostatic de-polarizing fields should not account for fluctuations in carrier densities. These findings suggest that metallic DPMs may offer functionalizable domain boundary behavior and deserve increased attention. Metallic DPMs allow highly tunable chemistries that can undergo various thermomechanical processing and transformation protocols. Ultimately, this study marks a milestone in metal physics and uncovers novel intermetallic properties, propelling the discovery and design of advanced electronic materials and devices.

Title: Gap Inhomogeneity in Cuprates: a view from Two-Dimensional Josephson Echo Spectroscopy
Authors: Alex Gómez Salvador, Ivan Morera, Marios H. Michael, Pavel E. Dolgirev, Danica Pavicevic, Albert Liu, Andrea Cavalleri, Eugene Demler
Abstract: Novel theoretical developments have allowed to connect microscopic disorder in bosonic collective excitations to the signatures in two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy (Gómez Salvador et al. 2025). Here, we employ this framework to analyze the recently measured Josepshon echoes in optimally doped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (Liu et al. 2024). We consider the spatial gap inhomogeneities -observed in scanning tunneling microscopy- as input for the disorder in the superfluid density, and compute the resulting echo peaks. The excellent agreement supports the interpretation that the gap inhomogeneity arises solely from pairing gap fluctuations, with no evidence for non-superconducting competing local orders. Finally, we study the microscopic origin of the inelastic processes, contributing to the damping of the Josephson plasmon at low temperatures, and conclude that it can be attributed to nodal quasiparticles.

Title: Twinning Relationships in Coexisting Cubic and Tetragonal Phases of Ferroelectrics
Authors: S. Gorfman, I. Biran, N. Zhang, Z.-G. Ye
Abstract: Many ferroelectric materials undergo thermally driven transitions between cubic and tetragonal phases. Despite being well-known for decades, such transitions still pose unresolved questions, particularly about the role of domains in shaping the transition pathway. It is understood that tetragonal domain assemblages are crucial for mismatch-free coexistence of both tetragonal and cubic phases, as described by the Weschler-Lieberman-Read (WLR) crystallographic theory. However, direct experimental characterization of domain patterns during the phase transition remains challenging. Here, we enhance the single-crystal X-ray diffraction to investigate domain microstructures during cubic-tetragonal phase transition, leveraging the bulk-penetrating and non-destructive character of this method. We extend the WLR model by the analytical expressions for the orientation relationships between the real and reciprocal bases of the cubic phase and tetragonal domains. We systematically catalogue the Bragg peak separations for 24 possible coexistence variants and validate these predictions using 3D reciprocal space maps from a piezo-/ferroelectric PMN-35PT crystal at phase coexistence temperatures. Our results provide a framework for interpreting domain configurations during the phase transition and offer insights applicable to other systems involving orientation relationships in coexisting phases.

Title: Superconductivity Proximate to Non-Abelian Fractional Spin Hall Insulator in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$
Authors: Cheong-Eung Ahn, Gyeoul Lee, Donghae Seo, Youngwook Kim, Gil Young Cho
Abstract: Twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ near two-degree twists has emerged as a platform for exotic correlated topological phases, including ferromagnetism and a non-Abelian fractional spin Hall insulator. Here we reveal the unexpected emergence of an intervalley superconducting phase that intervenes between these two states in the half-filled second moiré bands. Using a continuum model and exact diagonalization, we identify superconductivity through multiple signatures: negative binding energy, a dominant pair-density eigenvalue, finite superfluid stiffness, and pairing symmetry consistent with a time-reversal-symmetric nodal extended $s$-wave state. Remarkably, our numerical calculation suggests a continuous transition between superconductivity and the non-Abelian fractional spin Hall insulator, in which topology and symmetry evolve simultaneously, supported by an effective field-theory description. Our results establish higher moiré bands as fertile ground for intertwined superconductivity and topological order, and point to experimentally accessible routes for realizing superconductivity in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$.

Title: Universality classes of Anderson localization transitions in disordered three-dimensional non-Hermitian systems with exceptional points
Authors: C. Wang, X. R. Wang
Abstract: We conduct a numerical study of wave localization in disordered three-dimensional non-Hermitian systems featuring exceptional points. The energy spectrum of a disordered non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, exhibiting both parity-time and parity-particle-hole symmetries, forms a cross in the complex energy plane, with an exceptional point fixed at the origin. Near the exceptional point, the system experiences a disorder-driven quantum phase transition from extended to localized states, characterized as an Anderson localization transition in non-Hermitian systems. Notably, we identify a universal critical exponent that remains independent of the distribution of random variables. The model also supports Anderson localization transitions away from the exceptional points, albeit with different critical exponents. Furthermore, we investigate wave localization in a non-Hermitian system lacking parity-time symmetry, revealing distinct universality classes. By comparing the obtained critical exponents with those reported in the literature, we conclude that the presence of exceptional points introduces new universality classes that extend beyond the established 38-fold symmetry classification for non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Tensor Network Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Efficient Sampling of Three-Dimensional Spin Glasses and Beyond
Authors: Tao Chen, Jing Liu, Youjin Deng, Pan Zhang
Abstract: Sampling the three-dimensional (3D) spin glass -- i.e., generating equilibrium configurations of a 3D lattice with quenched random couplings -- is widely regarded as one of the central and long-standing open problems in statistical physics. The rugged energy landscape, pronounced critical slowing down, and intrinsic ergodicity breaking render standard Monte Carlo methods severely inefficient, particularly for large systems at low temperatures. In this work, we introduce the Tensor Network Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TNMCMC) approach to address the issue. It generates large-scale collective updates in MCMC using tensor networks on the 2D slices of the 3D lattice, greatly improving the autocorrelation time and offering orders-of-magnitude speed-ups over conventional MCMC in generating unbiased samples of the Boltzmann distribution. We conduct numerical experiments on 3D spin glasses up to system size $64\times 64\times 64$ using a single CPU, and show that TNMCMC dramatically suppresses critical slowing down in large disordered systems, which usually require a supercomputer to perform MCMC simulations. Furthermore, we apply our approach to the 3-state Potts model up to system size $64\times 64\times 64$ using a single CPU, and show that the TNMCMC approach efficiently traverses the exponential barriers of the strong first-order transition, whereas conventional MCMC fails. Our results reveal that TNMCMC opens a promising path toward tackling long-standing, formidable three-dimensional problems in statistical physics.

Title: Challenges and opportunities in orbitronics
Authors: Shunsuke Fukami, Kyung-Jin Lee, Mathias Kläui
Abstract: The spin of the electron has been a key enabler to realize spintronics devices that harness the spin degree of freedom beyond conventional charge-based electronics. In addition to spin, electrons have another degree of freedom associated with the angular momentum: orbital angular momentum. While spintronics has evolved fast and spintronics concepts are now used in magnetic sensors and nonvolatile memories, exploiting orbital angular momentum has just started to be studied. Phenomena mediated by orbital angular momentum have led to a new branch of spintronics called orbitronics. This Perspective discusses how orbitronics can constitute the next step in the evolution of spintronics by reviewing the current understandings and experimental results of orbital effects and summarizing the open questions. Prospects and challenges for devices in particular in non-volatile memory are discussed as an applications perspective.

Title: Strain-induced Dynamic Spin-Phonon Coupling in Epitaxial RuO2 Films
Authors: In Hyeok Choi, Seung Gyo Jeong2, Jae Hyuck Lee, San Kang, Sreejith Nair, Changyoung Kim, Dirk Wulferding, Bharat Jalan, Jong Seok Lee
Abstract: Magnetic order parameters in altermagnets can couple to quantized lattice vibration via both piezomagnetic and magnetoelastic effects, leading to the renormalization of phonon dispersion. Here, we demonstrate photo-induced dynamic frequency modulation of THz phonons excited in anisotropically-strained epitaxial RuO2 thin films using ultrafast coherent phonon spectroscopy and time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect measurement. A coherent oscillation of a transverse acoustic phonon appears in the sub-THz range with increasing film thickness above 4 nm due to local dislocation arising from the anisotropic strain relaxation, which hosts large non-zero shear strain. Interestingly, this phonon mode exhibits a time-varying mode hardening below ~ 500 K. Furthermore, an optical phonon oscillation emerges in magnetization dynamics of the photo-induced non-equilibrium state, and it becomes significantly softened near the critical temperature, while there is no observable magneto-optic signal in fully-strain-relaxed films. Such notable dynamic frequency modulations in acoustic and optical phonons offer an opportunity to manipulate phonons in the THz range through the spin-phonon coupling controlled by epitaxial design, which can inspire the new class of altermagnetic applications in the ultrafast quantum opto-spintronics.

Title: Stationary densities and delocalized domain walls in asymmetric exclusion processes competing for finite pools of resources
Authors: Sourav Pal, Parna Roy, Abhik Basu
Abstract: We explore the stationary densities and domain walls in the steady states of a pair of asymmetric exclusion processes (TASEPs) antiparallelly coupled to two particle reservoirs without any spatial extent by using the model in Haldar et al, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 111}, 014154 (2025). We show that the model admits {\em delocalized} domain walls which exist for some choices of the model parameters that define the effective entry and exit rates into the TASEP lanes. Surprisingly, in the parameter space spanned by these model parameters, the delocalized domain walls covers an {\em extended} region. The corresponding phase diagrams in the plane of the control parameters have different topology from those for an open TASEP or other models with multiple TASEPs connected to two reservoirs.

Title: One-dimensional lattice random walks in a Gaussian random potential
Authors: Silvio Kalaj, Enzo Marinari, Gleb Oshanin, Luca Peliti
Abstract: We study random walks evolving in continuous time on a one-dimensional lattice where each site $x$ hosts a quenched random potential $U_x$. The potentials on different sites are independent, identically distributed Gaussian random variables. We analyze three distinct models that specify how the transition rates depend on $U_x$: the random-force-like model, random walks with randomized stepping times, and the Gaussian trap model. Our analysis focuses on five key disorder-dependent quantities defined for a finite chain with $N$ sites: the probability current, its reciprocal (the resistance), the splitting probability, the mean first-passage time $T_N$, and the diffusion coefficient $D_N$ in a periodic chain. By determining the moments of these random variables, we demonstrate that the probability current, resistance, and splitting probability are not self-averaging, which leads to pronounced differences between their average and typical behaviors. In contrast, $T_N$ and $D_N$ become self-averaging when $N \to \infty$, though they exhibit strong sample-to-sample fluctuations for finite $N$.

Title: C-BerryTrans: A C++ code for first-principles calculation of Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities
Authors: Vivek Pandey, Sudhir K. Pandey
Abstract: We present C-BerryTrans, a C++ code designed for first-principles calculations of Berry-curvature-driven transverse transport properties, namely the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) i.e., $\sigma_{\mu \nu}^{AHC}$ and anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) i.e., $\alpha_{\mu \nu}^{ANC}$. The code directly extracts eigenvalues and momentum-matrix elements from WIEN2k calculations and evaluates the Berry curvature ($\boldsymbol\Omega$) using a Kubo-like formalism. For computational efficiency, C-BerryTrans parallelizes $\boldsymbol\Omega$ evaluation over k-points using OpenMP and stores band-resolved curvature in binary format. This design enables rapid post-processing of AHC and ANC over a wide range of temperatures and chemical potentials ($\mu$) in a single run. The code has been benchmarked on well-studied ferromagnetic materials (Fe, Fe$_3$Ge, Pd, Fe$_3$Al, and Co$_2$FeAl). For Fe, the $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ is obtained to be $\sim$775 ($\sim$744) $S/cm$ at 0 (300) K. In case of Fe$_3$Ge, the calculated value of $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ is found to be 311 $S/cm$ at the room temperature. Nextly, for Co$_2$FeAl, the magnitude of computed value of $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ at 2 K is found to be $\sim$56 $S/cm$. Next, magnitude of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ for Pd is obtained to be $\sim$0.97 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$ at 300 K. For Fe$_3$Al, the maximum magnitude of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ for $T\leq$500 K is computed as $\sim$2.83 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$. Lastly, for Co$_2$FeAl, the value of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ is obtained to be $\sim$0.10 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$ at 300 K. These results show good agreement with previously reported data. With its accuracy, scalability, and user-friendly workflow, C-BerryTrans provides a powerful tool for exploring $\boldsymbol\Omega$-driven transport phenomena and is well suited for high-throughput materials discovery.

Title: Quantum Saturation of Magnetoelectric Coupling in Fe$_3$O$_4$ Nanoparticles
Authors: Jian Huang, Fatemeh Aghabozorgi, Stephanie Brock
Abstract: We report magnetoelectric coupling in nanoparticle assemblies that persists to temperatures over 300 times lower than in previous studies. The ME response saturates at low temperature, revealing a quantum plateau of the coupling. A field dependence analysis shows a crossover from quadratic to linear behavior, captured by a phenomenological expansion $C(B,T) \simeq C_0(T) + a_1(T) B + a_2(T) B^2$. The magnitude of the extracted quadratic coefficient, $|a_2(T)|$, follows a power law $|a_2(T)| \sim T^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx 1.15$, indicating proximity to a quantum critical regime. The observed saturation reflects a new intrinsic energy scale, distinct from finite-size or extrinsic effects. These results establish nanoparticle assemblies as a new platform for studying quantum magnetoelectric phenomena.

Title: Design of model Boger fluids with systematically controlled viscoelastic properties
Authors: Jonghyun Hwang, Howard A. Stone
Abstract: The subject of viscoelastic flow phenomena is crucial to many areas of engineering and the physical sciences. Although much of our understanding of viscoelastic flow features stem from carefully designed experiments, preparation of model viscoelastic fluids remains an outstanding challenge; for example, fabricating a series of fluids with varied fluid shear moduli $G_0$, but with an identical relaxation time $\tau$, is nontrivial. In this work, we harness the non-ideality of nearly constant-viscosity elastic fluids (commonly known as `Boger fluids') made with polyisobutylene to develop an experimental methodology that produces a set of fluids with desired viscoelastic properties, specifically, $G_0$, $\tau$, and the first normal stress difference coefficient $\psi_1$. Through a simple linear algebraic manipulation between the rheological properties of interest ($G_0$, $\tau$, $\psi_1$) and the fluid compositions in terms of polymer concentration $c$, molecular weight $M_w$, and solvent viscosity $\eta_s$, we developed a `design equation' that takes $G_0$, $\tau$, $\psi_1$ as inputs and calculates values for $c$, $M_w$, $\eta_s$ as outputs. Using this method, fabrication of sample viscoelastic fluids whose rheological properties are \textit{a priori} known can be achieved.

Title: Effect of Tube Radius on the Adsorption of Chlorothalonil on Single-Walled Carbon and Boron Nitride Nanotube Surfaces: A Theoretical Study for Environmental Remediation
Authors: Francisco Gleidson de S. Ferreira, Caio V. C. Ribeiro da Silva, Silvete Guerini, Kleuton A. L. Lima, Douglas Soares Galvão, José Milton Elias de Matos, Alexandre Araujo de Souza
Abstract: We investigated the interaction of the pesticide chlorothalonil (CLT) with single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) using density functional theory (DFT) with the SIESTA code. Structural, energetic, and electronic analyses were used to characterize adsorption on nanotube surfaces. The adsorption energy becomes more favorable as the tube radius increases, consistent with enhanced pi-pi stacking on less curved surfaces. Both CNTs and BNNTs physisorb CLT; however, BNNTs appear more promising for CLT detection and removal in contaminated environments. The tube radius strongly affects the computed electronic and energetic descriptors. Complementary molecular dynamics simulations in GROMACS confirm the stability of CLT adsorbed on CNT and BNNT surfaces in aqueous solution.

Title: Structural, optical, and electrical properties of Cu-doped NiO films synthesized by spray pyrolysis for potential gas sensing applications
Authors: Eka Nurfani, Grace Grace, Mahardika Yoga Darmawan, Resti Marlina, Jumaeda Jatmika, Asnan Rinovian, Aditya Rianjanu
Abstract: Cu-doped NiO thin films were deposited on ITO substrates via spray pyrolysis at 450 °C for 1.5 minutes. XRD confirmed a cubic NiO structure, with Cu incorporation reducing crystallite size, increasing interplanar spacing, and expanding the lattice parameter, indicating successful substitution of Cu ions. Optical analysis showed a slight bandgap reduction from 3.70 to 3.65 eV, while PL revealed lower emission intensity, suggesting enhanced defect states and suppressed carrier recombination. Raman spectroscopy exhibited redshifts in LO, 2TO, and 2LO modes and the disappearance of the TO mode, confirming lattice distortion from Cu doping. Gas sensing tests under ambient and LPG conditions demonstrated significantly improved sensitivity and voltage-dependent response for doped films. These results establish that Cu incorporation enhances charge transport and gas interaction mechanisms, making Cu-doped NiO films highly promising for efficient and reliable gas sensors.

Title: Demagnetization-Driven Nanoscale Chirality-Selective Thermal Switch
Authors: In Hyeok Choi, Daeheon Kim, Yeon Jong Jin, Seungmo Yang, Tae-Seong Ju, Changsoo Kim, Chanyong Hwang, Dongbin Shin, Jong Seok Lee
Abstract: Chiral-lattice degrees of freedom can offer novel chirality-selective functionalities for thermotronic applications. Chiral phonons, carrying both heat and angular momentum, can emerge through a breaking of chiral degeneracy in the phonon bands, either via an intrinsic chiral crystal structure or by angular momentum transfer from photons or spins. This chiral controllability of the lattice dynamics enables a design of chiral thermo-devices by integrating ferromagnets with chiral materials. Here, we present a nanoscale chirality-selective thermal switch realized using a simple heterostructure composed of ferromagnetic [Co/Pt] multilayers and insulating chiral $\alpha$-SiO2, where an external magnetic field can control thermal transport properties. Our experimental results based on the magneto-optic thermometry reveal that the thermal conductivity of $\alpha$-SiO2 exhibits a clear dependence on both the magnetization direction of [Co/Pt] multilayers and the structural chirality of $\alpha$-SiO2, which is supported well by the first-principles-based molecular dynamic simulations. The magnetization-dependent thermal on/off ratio amounts to 1.07 at room temperature and increases to about 1.2 as temperature decreases to 50 K, due to a reduction of Umklapp phonon-phonon scattering rate in $\alpha$-SiO2. These findings provide the first experimental demonstration of the nanoscale chirality-selective thermal switch based on the ferromagnetic/chiral material heterostructure, highlighting its potential as a key technology for addressing heat dissipation challenges in nanoscale electronic devices.

Title: The role of the solid-melt interface in accelerating the self-catalyzed growth kinetics of III-V semiconductors
Authors: Zhucong Xi, Abby Liu, Xiaobo Chen, Meng Li, Dmitri N. Zakharov, Judith C. Yang, Rachel S. Goldman, Liang Qi
Abstract: Solid-melt interfaces play a pivotal role in governing crystal growth and metal-mediated epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) and other semiconductor materials. Using atomistic simulations based on machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), we uncover that multiple layers of Ga atoms at the GaN-Ga melt interface form structurally ordered and electronically charged configurations that are critical for the growth kinetics of GaN. These ordered layers modulate the free energy landscape (FEL) for N adsorption and substantially reduce the migration barriers for N at the interface compared to a clean GaN surface. Leveraging these interfacial energetics, kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations reveal that GaN growth follows a diffusion-controlled, layer-by-layer mechanism, with the FEL for N adsorption emerging as the rate-limiting factor. By incorporating facet-specific FELs and the diffusivity/solubility of N in Ga melt, we develop a predictive, fitting-free transport model that estimates facet-dependent growth rates in the range of ~0.01 to 0.04 nm/s, in agreement with experimental growth rates observed in GaN nanoparticles synthesized by Ga-mediated molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). This multiscale framework offers a generalizable and quantitative approach to link atomic-scale ordering and interfacial energetics to macroscopic phenomena, providing actionable insights for the rational design of metal-mediated epitaxial processes.

Title: Bose glass in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ nanofilms
Authors: Hiroyoshi Nobukane, Koki Hirose, Kakeru Isono, Mizuki Higashiizumi, Masahito Sakoda, Korekiyo Takahashi, Satoshi Tanda
Abstract: Weak localization of bosons can give rise to an exotic quantum phase known as a Bose glass, characterized by the absence of global phase coherence yet finite conductivity. This phase is crucial in understanding the interplay between disorder, interactions, and superconductivity, especially in two-dimensional and strongly correlated systems. Here we report the presence of the Bose glass phase in the weak localization region of ruthenium oxide Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. The electrical resistance exhibits a characteristic logarithmic temperature dependence in this phase, $\rho \sim \ln(1/T)$. Through $\beta$-function scaling analysis, we observed "vertical flow" indicating unconventional scaling behavior associated with localized bosonic states. Our results suggest the existence of bosons-Cooper pairs-persisting up to high temperatures around 220 K and that these bosons undergo weak localization. In the Bose glass phase, vortices are found to have a dual relationship with the localized Cooper pairs, enabling their motion and resulting in finite resistance despite the presence of bosonic order. We identified two quantum critical points: one between the Bose glass and superconducting phases and another between the Bose glass and Mott insulating phases, allowing us to extract the corresponding quantum sheet resistances. We revealed that the ground state of the Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ changes depending on the localization strength. Thinning the Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ corresponds to controlling the electronic correlation by relieving the distortion in RuO$_6$ octahedra. These findings offer significant insights into the interplay between electronic correlations and bosonic transport, with important implications for studying high-temperature superconductors based on perovskite structures.

Title: High-Precision Temperature Estimation Based on Magnetic Nanoparticles Dominated by Brownian Relaxation under Combined AC and DC Magnetic Fields
Authors: Zhongzhou Du, Wenze Zhang, Yi Sun, Na Ye, Yong Gan, Pengchao Wang, Xinwei Zhang, Yuanhao Zhang, Shijie Han, Haochen Zhang, Haozhe Wang, Wenzhong Liu, Takashi Yoshida
Abstract: Brownian relaxation is one of the primary mechanisms that allows magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to convert magnetic energy into thermal energy under an excitation magnetic field. Accurately characterizing the MNPs' magnetization dynamics dominated by Brownian relaxation is crucial for achieving high-precision temperature estimation. However, the lack of a readily applicable analytical expression remains a major obstacle to the advancement of magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia (MNPH). In this paper, the perturbation method was applied to derive analytical expressions from the Fokker-Planck equation, which characterized MNPs' magnetization behaviors under the AC and DC magnetic fields. Numerical simulations were conducted to validate the accuracy of the analytical expressions and to explore the correlation between temperature and the magnetization response. Then, a temperature analysis model based on magnetization harmonics was constructed. The first and second harmonic ratios and first harmonic phase were used to calculate MNPs' temperature, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that within 310 K to 320 K, the estimation error of the temperature using the amplitude ratio of the first to second harmonics is below 0.0151 K, while the error using the first harmonic phase is below 0.0218 K. The derived analytical expressions are expected to enhance the accuracy of MNP-based temperature measurements and facilitate their broader applications in MNPH and MNP imaging.

Title: Strong enhancement of d-wave superconductivity in an extended checkerboard Hubbard ladder
Authors: Xichen Huang, Saisai He, Jize Zhao, Zhong-Bing Huang
Abstract: By employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we study an extended checkerboard Hubbard model on the two-leg ladder, which includes an intraplaquette nearest-neighbour attraction V. The simulated results show that V plays a significant role in enhancing the d-wave superconductivity when the electron density is close to half-filling. In the homogeneous case t'=t (t and t' are the intraplaquette and interplaquette hopping integrals), large critical |Vc| is required to induce the superconducting ground state. With decreasing t', |Vc| is substantially diminished and the pair state has a nearly C4 symmetry. In the extremely inhomogeneous case t'<0.2t, the system transits to the d-wave superconducting phase at V\sim-0.3t and V\sim-0.4t for U=8t and U=12t, respectively, accompanying with a shift of spin and single-particle excitations from gapless to gapped type.

Title: Spin-stripes in the Hubbard model: a combined DMFT and Bethe-Salpeter analysis
Authors: Ruslan Mushkaev, Francesco Petocchi, Shintaro Hoshino, Philipp Werner
Abstract: The Hubbard model is known to accommodate various electronic orders, including stripes, which are important for understanding the physics of cuprates. We study spin-stripe order in the square lattice Hubbard model as a function of doping and temperature, by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equa- tion with the local vertex from dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), both inside and outside the antiferromagnetic phase. We find broad regions of horizontal/vertical spin stripes at low tempera- tures for the model with and without next-nearest neighbor hopping. Their wavelength depends on hole doping in a nonlinear fashion, and is highly sensitive to the ratio of nearest and next-nearest neighbor hoppings.

Title: High-energy electron-beam induced defect engineering of monolayer MoS2 for tunable optical properties
Authors: Anagha Gopinath, Faiha Mujeeb, Subhabrata Dhar, Jyoti Mohanty
Abstract: Structural defects in 2D-transition metal dichalcogenides are critical in modulating their optical and electrical behavior. Nevertheless, precise defect control within the monolayer regime poses a significant challenge. Herein, a high-energy (1MeV) electron beam irradiation strategy is harnessed to induce defects in monolayer MoS2. Controlled variation of electron-beam irradiation time tunes the defect density, as reflected by the evolution of defect-mediated photoluminescence characteristics. The optically active defect emission appearing at approx. 200-300meV below the A exciton at 85K exhibits a systematic increase in intensity with prolonged exposure and saturates at higher laser excitation power. Circular polarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals strong suppression of valley polarization of the A exciton after irradiation. Complementary x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy identifies enhanced Mo-O bonding signatures in MoS2 following irradiation. Kelvin probe force microscopy indicates the transition to p-type doping behaviour. A detailed temperature and power-dependent photoluminescence measurements further elucidate the optical behaviour of these defect states. Density functional theory calculations using these configurations establish that the transition between the conduction band and acceptor states within the bandgap accounts for the defect emission. This work presents a tunable route for defect engineering in monolayer TMDs, enabling controlled tailoring of their structural and optical properties for optoelectronic, electronic and valleytronic applications.

Title: Dipolar Interfacial Excitons in Lateral Semiconductor Heterostructures
Authors: Elie Vandoolaeghe, Francesco Fortuna, Suman Kumar Chakraborty, Biswajeet Nayak, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Prasana K. Sahoo, Thibault Chervy, Puneet A. Murthy
Abstract: Interfaces between materials or phases -- whether in condensed matter systems, biological membranes, or catalytic surfaces -- are rich with phenomena that are fundamentally distinct from those present in the bulk. In some cases, interfaces host quasiparticles, such as surface plasmons or Majorana fermions, which can significantly influence the material properties. Here, we investigate a unique 1D interface formed between two monolayer 2D semiconductors, MoSe2, and WSe2, and unambiguously observe a new type of excitonic quasiparticle that resides exclusively at the boundary. Our optical measurements reveal several remarkable properties of this interfacial exciton. First, it possesses an in-plane dipole moment with exceptionally large dipole lengths of 2nm. The emission spectrum reveals narrow discrete states, indicating strong quantum confinement of the center-of-mass motion across the interface. Power-dependent measurements show a sublinear saturation behavior, reflecting interactions between dipolar excitons in this low-dimensional system. Moreover, the exciton displays striking sensitivity to charge carriers due to its dipolar character. Our results introduce a new platform for exploring interacting 1D dipolar bosonic systems with unique quantum properties and open pathways for novel optoelectronic devices, including applications in nonlinear quantum photonics.

Title: Charge-localization-driven metal-insulator phase transition in layered molecular conductors
Authors: Savita Priya, Maxim Wenzel, Olga Iakutkina, Marvin Schmidt, Christian Prange, Dieter Schweitzer, Yohei Saito, Reizo Kato, Koichi Hiraki, Martin Dressel
Abstract: The organic conductor $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ provides the prime example of a charge-order-driven metal-insulator transition. Restricted chemical substitution of S atoms by Se in the constituent molecules allows us to modify the electronic properties. This not only decreases the transition temperature but, in addition, alters the phase transition mechanism, resulting in the ground state deviating from the charge-ordered insulator state of the parent compound. Employing infrared optical spectroscopy, we investigate changes in the charge dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate the absence of charge ordering in the Se-substituted materials and suggest that the phase transition is instead driven by the localization of the itinerant charge carriers due to strong electron-phonon interactions.

Title: Bromine-methanol etching of semiconductor crystals $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ with different selenium concentrations
Authors: S.V. Naydenov, G.M. Babenko, O.K. Kapustnyk, I.M. Pritula
Abstract: The effect of the selenium concentration in the composition of the $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ semiconductor crystals on their etching with a bromine-methanol solution was studied. A thermodynamic model is proposed to describe the degree of etching of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te$ and $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals. A thermodynamic law is obtained for the first time to describe the change in the etching rate of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals with different selenium concentrations. Experimental dependencies are constructed for etching trajectories and etching rates with 5% bromine-methanol solutions of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystal samples with nominal $x\sim 0.1$ and selenium concentrations of $y=0$, $y=0.02$, $y=0.06$, and $y=0.1$. The average etching rates were 24${\mu }$m/min, 18${\mu }$m/min, 15${\mu }$m/min, and 13${\mu }$m/min. The threshold effect of a strong decrease in the etching rate upon transition from ternary $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te$ to quaternary $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals, associated with hardening of the crystal structure, is identify and theoretically explained. The obtained experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical estimates and will be useful for choosing the optimal regimes of crystal treatment.

Title: Nonequilibrium statistics of barrier crossings with competing pathways
Authors: Gulzar Ahmad, Sergey Saveliev, Steven P Fitzgerald, Marco G Mazza, Andrew J Archer
Abstract: Many biological, chemical, and physical systems are underpinned by stochastic transitions between equilibrium states in a potential energy. Here, we consider such transitions in a minimal model with two possible competing pathways, both starting from a local potential energy minimum and eventually finding the global minimum. There is competition between the distance to travel in state space and the height of the potential energy barriers to be surmounted, for the transition to occur. One pathway has a higher energy barrier to go over, but requires traversing a shorter distance, whereas the other pathway has a lower potential barrier but it is substantially further away in configuration space. The most likely pathway taken depends on the available time for the transition process; when only a relatively short time is available, the most likely path is the one over the higher barrier. We find that upon varying temperature the overall most likely pathway can switch from one to the other. We calculate the statistics of where the barrier crossing occurs and the distribution of times taken to reach the potential minimum. Interestingly, while the configuration space statistics is complex, the time of arrival statistics is rather simple, having an exponential probability density over most of the time range. Taken together, our results show that empirically observed rates in nonequilibrium systems should not be used to infer barrier heights.

Title: Synchronization transitions and spike dynamics in a higher-order Kuramoto model with Lévy noise
Authors: Dan Zhao, Jürgen Kurths, Norbert Marwan, Yong Xu
Abstract: Synchronization in various complex networks is significantly influenced by higher-order interactions combined with non-Gaussian stochastic perturbations, yet their mechanisms remain mainly unclear. In this paper, we systematically investigate the synchronization and spike dynamics in a higher-order Kuramoto model subjected to non-Gaussian Lévy noise. Using the mean order parameter, mean first-passage time, and basin stability, we identify clear boundaries distingusihing synchronization and incoherent states under different stability indexes and scale parameters of Lévy noise. For fixed coupling parameters, synchronization weakens as the stability index decreases, and even completely disappears when the scale parameter exceeds a critical threshold. By varying coupling parameters, we find significant dynamical phenomena including bifurcations and hysteresis. Lévy noise smooths the synchronization transitions and requires stronger coupling compared to Gaussian white noise. Furthermore, we define spikes and systematically investigate their statistical and spectral characteristics. The maximum number of spikes is observed at small scale parameter. A generalized spectral analysis further reveals burst-like structure via an edit distance algorithm. Moreover, a power-law distribution is observed in the large inter-window intervals of spikes, showing great memory effects. These findings deepen the understanding of synchronization and extreme events in complex networks driven by non-Gaussian Lévy noise.

Title: Spontaneous $π$ flux trapping in granular rings of unconventional superconductors
Authors: Junyi Zhang, Yi Li
Abstract: We study Josephson couplings in unconventional superconductors from a symmetry-based perspective, extending the Sigrist-Rice formula to broader classes of pairing symmetries and in the presence of junction interface disorder effects. Applying this formalism to granular superconducting rings, we show that single-band chiral superconductors cannot spontaneously trap magnetic flux, which rules out chiral $p$-wave pairing as a candidate for $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd superconductor, given the observation of half quantum flux in recent Little-Parks experiments. Taking into account the full crystalline symmetry and time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting state of $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd, we propose that the effective pairing is a triplet helical equal-spin state, enforced by spin-orbit couplings arising from local inversion symmetry breaking. We further demonstrate that granular rings of such helical superconductors can support spontaneous flux trapping, even in the presence of strong junction interface orientation disorder. Our proposal reconciles apparent inconsistencies among different experimental observations and highlights the crucial role of local inversion symmetry breaking in understanding the pairing symmetry in $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd.

Title: Cation accumulation drives the preferential partitioning of DNA in an aqueous two-phase system
Authors: Hiroki Sakuta, Yuki Akamine, Akari Kamo, Hao Gong, Norikazu Ichihashi, Arash Nikoubashman, Miho Yanagisawa
Abstract: Mixtures of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran (Dex) represent a widely used class of aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS), with applications ranging from the purification of various biomolecules such as nucleic acids to the synthesis of protocells. A key feature underlying these applications is the selective accumulation of biomolecules within Dex-rich droplets in an aqueous PEG phase, but the physical origin of this partitioning remains unclear. Depletion interactions were long assumed to be the primary driving force; however, our systematic experiments using DNA of different lengths indicate that depletion alone cannot fully explain the observed behavior. We identify an additional and previously underappreciated contribution from electrostatic interactions: Dex carries a slightly more negative charge than PEG, which drives preferential cation accumulation in the Dex-rich phase. These counterions facilitate the selective partitioning of DNA inside the Dex-rich droplets. This mechanism explains the dependency of DNA uptake in Dex-rich droplets on polymer length and salt concentration. Our findings establish Donnan-type ion partitioning as a central principle of nucleic acid localization in Dex-rich droplets, offering a unified explanation for this long-standing phenomenon. They lay the foundation for designing ATPS-based systems and help elucidate the physicochemical principles of biomolecular partition upon phase separation in cells.

Title: Detection of magnetic monopole in image potential states of topological insulators
Authors: Yang Zhan, Huaiyu Zhang, Yu Wang, Baojie Feng, Peng Cheng, Lan Chen
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles, hypothetical particles behaving as isolated magnetic charges, have long been predicted by theories beyond the standard model but remain elusive in experimental detection. In this study, we demonstrate a novel method to induce and detect magnetic monopoles on the surface of three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). By applying a radially distributed electric field via the STM tip to induce an image magnetic monopole using the topological magnetoelectric (TME) effect, we observe electric field-dependent intrinsic splitting peaks of image potential states (IPS) on the surface of a 3D high-order TI Bi(111). These IPS splitting phenomena originate from the Zeeman effect of the orbital magnetic moments interacting with the magnetic field generated by the magnetic monopoles. Our experimental results, supported by theoretical modeling, successfully demonstrate the detection of magnetic monopole. This work not only deepens our understanding of topological field theory and axion insulators but also opens new avenues for detecting and manipulating magnetic monopoles. The findings suggest that similar studies can be extended to other topological insulator systems, offering potential applications in quantum computing and novel electronic devices.

Title: The influence of solute induced memory on interface migration
Authors: Chad W. Sinclair, Jörg Rottler
Abstract: Interface migration governs microstructural evolution during phase transformations and grain growth thereby dictating those material properties that depend on microstructure. Recent work continues to highlight the rich range of behaviors exhibited by migrating interfaces and the complex connection between these behaviors and the underlying atomistic processes that determine coarse-grained interfacial mobility. For interfaces moving at low homologous temperatures and small driving forces, we show that significant non-Markovian effects can arise that invalidate commonly used analysis methods. Specifically, we demonstrate that solute can act as a source of such non-Markovian motion. In turn, we introduce a time-local (TCL) propagator approach to account for memory-dominated short and intermediate time interface dynamics. This approach extrapolates to the long time diffusive limit, enabling robust mobility estimates from simulation windows far shorter than those required to observe linear scaling directly. Comparison with solute-free boundaries validates the method and quantifies solute drag in the Cahn-Hillert sense, providing a route to extract drag coefficients and effective mobilities across a range of solute concentrations. Our results demonstrate that analysis including memory is essential for connecting atomistic simulations to continuum models and offer a practical framework for studying interface kinetics in systems with slow internal processes.

Title: Strong Correlations and Superconductivity in the Supermoiré Lattice
Authors: Zekang Zhou, Cheng Shen, Kryštof Kolář, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Cyprian Lewandowski, Mitali Banerjee
Abstract: The supermoiré lattice, arising from the interference of multiple moiré patterns, dramatically reshapes the electronic band structure by introducing new minibands and modifying band dispersion. Concurrently, strong electronic interactions within moiré flat bands lead to the emergence of various correlated states. However, the impact of the supermoiré lattice on the flat band systems with strong interactions remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the existence of the supermoiré lattice in the mirror-symmetry-broken twisted trilayer graphene, elucidating its role in generating mini-flat bands and mini-Dirac bands. Furthermore, we demonstrate interaction-induced symmetry-broken phases in the supermoiré mini-flat bands alongside the cascade of superconductor-insulator transitions enabled by the supermoiré lattice. Our work shows that robust superconductivity can exist in the mirror-symmetry-broken TTG and underscores the significance of the supermoiré lattice as an additional degree of freedom for tuning the electronic properties in twisted multilayer systems, sheds light on the correlated quantum phases such as superconductivity in the original moiré flat bands, and highlights the potential of using the supermoiré lattice to design and simulate novel quantum phases.

Title: Magnetoelectric Switching of Competing Magnetic Orders in Rhombohedral Graphene
Authors: Kilian Krötzsch, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Arnaud Magrez, Mitali Banerjee
Abstract: A finite Hall conductance under zero magnetic field implies time reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking due to magnetic ordering. In rhombohedral (RH) stacked graphene, the angular momentum breaking TRS can result from the orbital degree of freedom at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys. This leads to valley polarization and occupation-dependent anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) due to the chirality in Berry curvature between the valleys. We report magnetoelectric control of orbital magnetic order in crystalline rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (RHG), achieved without the introduction of a moiré superlattice. At moderate displacement fields and low carrier densities, we observe a non-volatile and hysteretic AHR that can be electrically toggled by sweeping either the carrier density or the displacement field. Upon the application of small perpendicular magnetic fields, the system reveals a characteristic double sign reversal of the AHR, indicating a competition between distinct magnetic ground states. This interplay between valley polarization, orbital magnetism, and electric and magnetic field tuning demonstrates the rich multiferroic behavior of RHG. Our findings present crystalline RHG as a minimal, tunable platform for studying symmetry-breaking phases and magnetic order in flat-band systems, offering insight into the coupling between electronic structure and magnetoelectric response.

Title: Topological transitions controlled by the interaction range
Authors: Vlad Simonyan, Maxim A. Gorlach
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional topological model featuring a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger type pattern of nearest-neighbor cou- plings in combination with the longer-range interactions exponentially decaying with the distance. We demonstrate that even relatively weak long-range couplings can trigger the topological transition if their range is large enough. This provides an additional facet in the control of topological phases.

Title: Robust Majorana Platform Driven by a Meissner-Induced Anisotropic Doppler Shift
Authors: Xiao-Hong Pan, Si-Qi Yu, Li Chen, Fu-Chun Zhang, Xin Liu
Abstract: The realization of robust Majorana zero modes (MZMs), a cornerstone for fault-tolerant quantum computing, is hindered by the challenge of creating a platform that simultaneously offers a large topological gap, high tunability, and resilience to disorder. A system unifying these properties has remained elusive. Here, we propose and validate a novel platform that harnesses the Meissner effect in a topological insulator (TI) nanowire partially covered by a superconducting (SC) layer. Under an external magnetic field, Meissner screening currents in the SC induce a spatially varying Doppler shift on the TI surface. This effect generates a highly anisotropic effective g-factor, which selectively drives a topological phase transition localized on the nanowire's bottom surface. This mechanism is crucial as it spatially separates the topological phase from the SC/TI interface, permitting strong proximity-induced superconductivity while preventing detrimental band renormalization at the interface from closing the topological gap. Furthermore, by confining the topological superconducting phase to the gate-tunable bottom surface, our platform fully leverages the intrinsic disorder resilience of the TI's topologically protected surface states. Through a combination of supercurrent simulations, self-consistent Schrödinger-Poisson calculations, and large-scale tight-binding computations, we validate the platform's robustness. Our work establishes a practical pathway toward Meissner-mediated topological superconductivity for realizing robust MZMs in SC/TI hybrid systems.

Title: Griffiths phase emerging from strong mutualistic disorder in high-dimensional interacting systems
Authors: Tommaso Jack Leonardi, Amos Maritan, Sandro Azaele
Abstract: The majority of analysis of interacting systems is done for weak and well-balanced interactions, when in fact topology and rare event factors often result in strong and sign-biased interactions when considering real systems. We analyse the impact of strong mutualistic interactions in a uniformly weighted Erdős-Rényi network under generalised Lotka-Volterra dynamics. In difference to the typical case we show the interaction topology and system dynamics combine to produce power law abundance distributions in a critical region of the phase diagram, identifiable as a Griffiths phase. We find asymptotic expressions for the fixed point solution in this region, and establish the boundary of this region as when topology alone determines the abundance distribution. We show that the Griffiths phase persists for strong mutualistic interactions more generally, and survives when combined with weak all-to-all competition.

Title: Intrinsic spin accumulation in magnetic spin Hall effect
Authors: Atsuo Shitade
Abstract: The magnetic spin Hall effect is a time-reversal-odd phenomenon in which spin current is induced by the charge current. In the presence of a spin-orbit coupling and/or noncolinear magnetism, however, spin current is not uniquely defined. Instead, we study an intrinsic response of spin to an electric field gradient that describes the spin accumulation at the boundaries of magnetic systems. We derive a generic formula expressed by Bloch wave functions and apply it to a minimal model for representative altermagnets, RuO$_{2}$ and MnF$_{2}$. Our results show that the intrinsic spin accumulation can be nonzero in magnetic insulators in sharp contrast to the magnetic spin Hall conductivity.

Title: Fabrication of hydrogen-bonded metal inorganic-organic complex glasses by ligand-tuning approach

Abstract: Metal inorganic-organic complex (MIOC) crystals are a new category of hybrid glass formers. However, the glass-forming compositions of MIOC crystals are limited due to lack of both a general design principle for such compositions and a deep understanding of the structure and formation mechanism for MIOC glasses. This work reports a general approach for synthesizing glass-forming MIOC crystals. In detail, the principle of this approach is based on the creation of hydrogen-bonded structural network by substituting acid anions for imidazole or benzimidazole ligands in the tetrahedral units of zeolitic imidazolate framework crystals. By tuning the metal centers, anions, and organic ligands of MIOCs, supramolecular unit structures can be designed to construct supramolecular networks and thereby enable property modulation. Furthermore, mixed-ligand synthesis yielded a mixed-crystal system in which the glass-transition temperature (Tg) can be linearly tuned from 282 K to 360 K through gradual substitution of benzimidazole for imidazole. Interestingly, upon vitrification, MIOCs were observed to undergo reorganization of hydrogen-bonded networks, with retention of tetrahedral units, short-range disorder, and the freezing of multiple conformations. This work offers a new strategy to systematically expand the glass-forming compositional range of MIOCs and to develop functional MIOC glasses.

Title: Quantum superconducting diode effect with perfect efficiency above liquid-nitrogen temperature
Authors: Heng Wang, Yuying Zhu, Zhonghua Bai, Zhaozheng Lyu, Jiangang Yang, Lin Zhao, X. J. Zhou, Genda Gu, Qi-Kun Xue, Ding Zhang
Abstract: The superconducting diode is an emergent device that juggles between the Cooper-paired state and the resistive state with unpaired quasiparticles. Here, we report a quantum version of the superconducting diode, which operates solely between Cooper-paired states. This type of quantum superconducting diode takes advantage of quantized Shapiro steps for digitized outputs. The devices consist of twisted high-temperature cuprate superconductors, and exhibit the following distinguished characteristics: (1) a non-reciprocal diode behavior can be simply initiated by current training without applying an external magnetic field; (2) perfect diode efficiency is achieved under microwave irradiations at a record-high working temperature; (3) the quantized nature of the output offers high resilience against input noises. These features open up unprecedented opportunities toward developing practical dissipationless quantum circuits.

Title: Snakelike trajectories of electrons released from quantum dots driven by the spin Hall effect
Authors: B. Szafran, P. Wojcik
Abstract: Using time dependent simulations, we analyze the trajectories of electrons released from a quantum dot in a waveguide made of a spin-orbit-coupled material (InSb). An electron released from the quantum dot, when driven by an electric field follows a trajectory that is deflected by spin-orbit interaction and undergoes spin precession that results in a spin-dependent, snake-like trajectory. The trajectory strongly depends on the initial state of the electron, enabling detection of the electron quantum state in the dot when connected to the T-junction. Notably, we show that the snake-like trajectory persists even under a small external magnetic field with low, incomplete initial electron spin polarization. Our findings are supported by semiclassical calculations of the electron trajectory, which show good agreement with full quantum mechanical simulations

Title: Ligand co-deposition in focused electron beam induced nanoprinting: a predictive composition model
Authors: Jakub Jurczyk, Leo Brockhuis, Amalio Fernández-Pacheco, Ivo Utke
Abstract: Recent advances in nanotechnology have created the need to manufacture three-dimensional nanostructures with controlled material composition. Focused Electron Beam Induced Deposition (FEBID) is a nanoprinting technique offering highest spatial resolution combined with the ability to directly 3D-print almost any shape. It relies on local electron-induced dissociation of metal-ligand organometallic molecules adsorbed onto a substrate. So far FEBID continuum modelling involved the surface kinetics of precursor molecules during electron irradiation and succeeded in the prediction of nanoprint shape and growth rate and forms nowadays the basis of software for 3D nano-printing of nanostructures. Here, we expand the model to the surface kinetics of detached ligands. Involving their dissociation and desorption behavior allows to predict trends in the metallic composition of the nanoprinted material and to define desirable nanoprint process windows as function of electron exposure time and flux. We present the theoretical foundations of the model, validate it experimentally for chromium and silver precursors, compare calculated values with literature data for various precursors, and discuss its potential to design new experiments. This contribution enhances our understanding of FEBID dynamics and provides a versatile framework for predictive FEBID material nano-printing.

Abstract: The ability to fabricate anisotropic superconducting layers a la carte is desired in technologies such as fluxon screening or removal in field-resilient devices, flux lensing in ultra-sensitive sensors, or in templates for imprinting magnetic structures in hybrid magnetic/superconducting multilayers. In this work, we demonstrate tailored superconductivity in polycrystalline niobium thin films exposed to femtosecond ultraviolet laser pulses. The samples exhibit significant changes in their superconducting properties, directly connected with the observed topography, crystallite geometry, and lattice parameter modifications. On the mesoscopic scale, quasi-parallel periodic ripple structures (about 260 nm of spatial period) gradually form on the film surface by progressively increasing the laser energy per pulse, Ep. This gives way to a stepwise increase of the critical current anisotropy and magnetic flux channeling effects along the ripples. As demonstrated in our resistive and inductive measurements, these superstructures determine the electromagnetic response of the sample within the regime dominated by flux-pinning. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations corroborate the topographical origin of the customized anisotropy. Concurrently, intrinsic superconducting parameters (critical field and temperature) are moderately and isotropically depressed upon increasing Ep, as is the lattice parameter of Nb. These findings promote pulsed laser processing as a flexible, one-step, and scalable lithography-free technique for versatile surface functionalization in microelectronic superconducting technology.

Title: Geometric flow of planar domain-wall loops
Authors: Pablo Domenichini, German Salazar, Alejandro B. Kolton
Abstract: We investigate the geometric evolution of elastic domain-wall loops in two dimensions. Assuming an instantaneous, isotropic, and homogeneous arc-velocity response of the domain wall to external pressure and local signed curvature, we derive closed dynamical equations linking the enclosed area and loop perimeter for both linear and nonlinear arc-velocity response functions. This reduced description enables predictions for the dynamics of both spontaneous and externally driven domains-subjected to constant or alternating fields-within the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau scalar $\phi ^4$ model. In the linear response regime, where a non-crossing principle holds in the absence of external driving, we obtain exact results. In particular, we demonstrate that the relaxation rate of the total spontaneous magnetization becomes quantized for arbitrary initial conditions involving multiple, possibly nested, loops, with discrete jumps corresponding to individual loop collapse events. Under external driving, the avoidance principle breaks down due to sparse interactions between interfaces-either within a single loop or between multiple loops-leading to coalescence or splitting events that change the number of loops. A quantized geometrical observable involving the total area and perimeter is identified in this case as well, exhibiting discrete jumps both at interface interaction events and at individual loop collapses. We further use approximate area-perimeter relations to estimate the spontaneous collapse lifetimes of compact magnetic domains, as well as their dynamics under alternating-field-assisted collapse in disordered ultrathin magnetic films. Our predictions are compared with experimental observations in such systems.

Title: Response to dynamic shape changes in suspensions of hard rectangles
Authors: Denis Dertli, Thomas Speck
Abstract: While the autonomous assembly of hard nanoparticles with different shapes has been studied extensively both in experiment and simulations, little is known about systems where particle shape can be dynamically altered. DNA origami nanostructures offer an alternative route to synthesize nanoparticles that can change their shape on demand. Motivated by recent experiments, here we study the structure and dynamics of suspensions of hard squares in response to an elongation into a rectangle. Performing extensive hard-particle Monte Carlo simulations at constant volume and employing two protocols, we numerically analyze the collective diffusion and ordering during quenching and the subsequent relaxation to the new equilibrium state. We find that the cascading protocol, which mimics experimentally realized DNA origami, can become dynamically arrested due to the increase in effective packing fraction.

Title: Nanoscale Polar Landscapes in Quantum Paraelectric SrTiO3
Authors: Yang Zhang, Suk Hyun Sung, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Cong Li, Pu Yu, Robert Hovden, Ismail El Baggari
Abstract: SrTiO3 is a textbook quantum paraelectric, with ferroelectricity purportedly suppressed by quantum fluctuations of ionic positions down to the lowest temperatures. The precise real space structure of SrTiO3 at low temperature, however, has remained undefined despite decades of study. Here we directly image the low-temperature polar structure of quantum parelectric SrTiO3, using cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy down to 20 K. High resolution imaging reveals a spatially fluctuating landscape of nanoscale domains of finite polarization. The short-range polar domains first grow and self-organize into a periodic structure over tens of nanometers. However, the process reverses when entering the quantum paraelectric regime below 40 K and the periodically ordered polar nanodomains fragment into small clusters.

Title: The Limits of Inference in Complex Systems: When Stochastic Models Become Indistinguishable
Authors: Javier Aguilar, Miguel A. Muñoz, Sandro Azaele
Abstract: Robust inference methods are essential for parameter estimation and model selection in stochastic modeling approaches, which provide interpretable frameworks for describing time series of complex phenomena. However, applying such methods is often challenging, as they typically demand either high-frequency observations or access to the model's analytical solution, resources that are rarely available in practice. Here, we address these limitations by designing a novel Monte Carlo method based on full-path statistics and bridge processes, which optimize sampling efforts and performance even under coarse sampling. We systematically investigate how experimental design -- particularly sampling frequency and dataset size -- shapes inference accuracy, revealing optimal sampling regimes and the fundamental limits of model distinguishability. We validate our approach on four datasets -- optical tweezers, human microbiome, topic mentions in social media, and forest population dynamics -- where resolution-dependent limits to inference emerge, offering fresh insight into ongoing debates about the dominant sources of noise in these systems. Overall, this work shows how combining minimal stochastic models with path-inference tools and model selection can guide the experimental design of optimized strategies in data collection and clarify the boundaries of model-based understanding in complex systems.

Title: A minimal model of self-organized clusters with phase transitions in ecological communities
Authors: Shing Yan Li, Mehran Kardar, Zhijie Feng, Washington Taylor
Abstract: In complex ecological communities, species may self-organize into clusters or clumps where highly similar species can coexist. The emergence of such species clusters can be captured by the interplay between neutral and niche theories. Based on the generalized Lotka-Volterra model of competition, we propose a minimal model for ecological communities in which the steady states contain self-organized clusters. In this model, species compete only with their neighbors in niche space through a common interaction strength. Unlike many previous theories, this model does not rely on random heterogeneity in interactions. By varying only the interaction strength, we find an exponentially large set of cluster patterns with different sizes and combinations. There are sharp phase transitions into the formation of clusters. There are also multiple phase transitions between different sets of possible cluster patterns, many of which accumulate near a small number of critical points. We analyze such a phase structure using both numerical and analytical methods. In addition, the special case with only nearest neighbor interactions is exactly solvable using the method of transfer matrices from statistical mechanics. We analyze the critical behavior of these systems and make comparisons with existing lattice models.

Title: Extrapolation of Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials for Organic and Polymeric Systems
Authors: Natalie E. Hooven, Arthur Y. Lin, Rose K. Cersonsky
Abstract: Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) have surged in popularity due to their promise of expanding the spatiotemporal scales possible for simulating molecules with high fidelity. The accuracy of any MLIP is dependent on the data used for its training; thus, for large molecules, like polymers, where accurate training data is prohibitively difficult to obtain, it becomes necessary to pursue non-traditional methods to construct MLIPs, many of which are based on constructing MLIPs using smaller, analogous chemical systems. However, we have yet to understand the limits to which smaller molecules can be used as a proxy for extrapolating macromolecular energetics. Here, we provide a ``control study'' for such experiments, exploring the ability of MLIP approaches to extrapolate between n=1-8 n-polyalkanes at identical conditions. Through Principal Covariates Classification, we quantitatively demonstrate how convergence in chemical environments between training and testing datasets coincides with an MLIP's transferability. Additionally, we show how careful attention to the construction of an MLIP's neighbor list can promote greater transferability when considering various levels of the energetic hierarchy. Our results establish a roadmap for how one can create transferable MLIPs for macromolecular systems without the prohibitive cost of constructing system-specific training data.

Title: Two-dimensional THz spectroscopy in electronic systems: a many-body diagrammatic approach
Authors: Jacopo Fiore, Niccolò Sellati, Mattia Udina, Lara Benfatto
Abstract: The term two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) usually refers to experimental setups where a coherently generated electric field in a sample is recorded over many runs as a function of two time variables: the delay $\tau$ between two consequent excitation pulses and the time $t$ over which the signal is emitted. While its implementation in the femtosecond time domain for studying vibrational molecular states has been developed for over two decades, its experimental application in the THz domain to interacting electronic systems remains in its infancy. This work provides a general theoretical framework for describing and interpreting 2DCS using a many-body language based on a perturbative diagrammatic expansion, as widely applied in linear spectroscopy. Focusing on centrosymmetric systems, we show that interpreting the 2D maps can be recast into two complementary problems. The first is the evaluation of a third-order response function to the gauge field. In the velocity gauge, this leads to semi-analytical expressions that both reduce computational complexity and assist in assigning spectral features to microscopic processes, as shown using a toy model of electrons undergoing a charge-density wave transition. The second is a careful treatment of multi-wave propagation effects, which, in bulk systems, can obscure the intrinsic nonlinear response, demonstrated here for soft superconducting Josephson plasmons. Our results provide a solid foundation for extending 2DCS to complex interacting systems and offer a flexible method to realistically model nonlinear responses across arbitrary spectral widths.

Title: Collective transport efficiency of microswimmer swarms optimized by tactic run-tumble dynamics
Authors: Maggie Liu, Arnold J. T. M. Mathijssen
Abstract: The collective motion of microorganisms and microrobots can be used for particle delivery, especially when guided by external magnetic fields, phototaxis, or chemotaxis. This cargo transport is enhanced significantly by hydrodynamic entrainment, where the surrounding fluid and any dissolved molecules or suspended cargo particles are dragged along with a collectively moving swarm. However, it remains unclear how this directed entrainment is affected by stochastic run-tumble motion, and how such motility patterns couple to particle dispersion. Here, we combine theory and simulations to compute the entrainment velocity and diffusivity for different degrees of swimmer directedness. Surprisingly, we find that the transport efficiency Péclet number, the ratio of advective to diffusive transport, is optimal for intermediate directedness values, so perfectly guided active suspensions perform worse than those with stochastic reorientations. These results could have implications for microrobotic drug delivery and nutrient transport in microbial environments.

Title: Electrical resistivity of microstructural components in Al-Mg-Si alloys
Authors: Gautam Kumar, Amram Azulay, Omer Coriat, Hanna Bishara
Abstract: Al-Mg-Si alloys are utilized in large scale electrical conduction applications thanks to their low density, high strength, and low electrical resistivity. The alloying elements, Mg and Si, are introduced to improve the mechanical strength; however, the formed defects also suppress electrical conductivity, adversely affecting the material performance. Here, we investigate the impact of alloying, heat treatment, and the corresponding microstructure, on the electrical resistivity of overaged alloys having 0.5-9.5 at. % solute. The crystal structure, composition, and microstructure are characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The electrical resistivity of the microstructural components, i.e., the Al solid solution matrix and the Si and Mg2Si precipitates, are directly measured using a microscale four-point probe setup inside a scanning electron microscope. We find that the Al solid solution matrix is up to 15 % more resistive than pure Al, depending on the heat treatment rather than the composition, and that regions including Si or Mg2Si precipitates are equally resistive. Additionally, the bulk alloy resistivity, measured conventionally on a macroscopic length scale, increases linearly up to 60 % with increasing total solute concentration up to ~ 10 at. %. This study relates the electrical resistivity of Al-Mg-Si alloys, measured at microscopic and macroscopic length scales, with their microstructure and composition.

Title: Coupling induced emergent topology in a two-leg fermionic ladder
Authors: Rajashri Parida, Biswajit Paul, Soumya Ranjan Padhi, Tapan Mishra
Abstract: We investigate the ground state properties of spinless fermions on a two leg ladder, by allowing the nearest-neighbour hopping dimerization in one leg and uniform hopping in the other. In the non-interacting limit, we find that, at half-filling, the system exhibits robust topological behavior if the inter-leg hopping is allowed. As a result, a topological phase transition occurs as a function of the inter-leg hopping. When the inter-leg interaction is turned on, the topological phase survives, and we obtain an interaction induced topological phase transition as a function of interaction. Moreover, we show that for both the non-interacting and interacting cases, topological nature of the system survives even by altering the dimerization pattern in the dimerized leg, resulting in two topological phases of opposite character. Finally, we reveal that when uniform interactions are included on all the bonds of the ladder, the topological phase transitions to a symmetry-broken charge-density wave (CDW) phase.

Title: Momentum-resolved two-dimensional spectroscopy as a probe of nonlinear quantum field dynamics
Authors: Duilio De Santis, Alex Gómez Salvador, Nataliia Bazhan, Sebastian Erne, Maximilian Prüfer, Claudio Guarcello, Davide Valenti, Jörg Schmiedmayer, Eugene Demler
Abstract: Emergent collective excitations constitute a hallmark of interacting quantum many-body systems, yet in solid-state platforms their study has been largely limited by the constraints of linear-response probes and by finite momentum resolution. We propose to overcome these limitations by combining the spatial resolution of ultracold atomic systems with the nonlinear probing capabilities of two-dimensional spectroscopy (2DS). As a concrete illustration, we analyze momentum-resolved 2DS of the quantum sine-Gordon model describing the low energy dynamics of two weakly coupled one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. This approach reveals distinctive many-body signatures, most notably asymmetric cross-peaks reflecting the interplay between isolated ($B_2$ breather) and continuum ($B_1$ pair) modes. The protocol further enables direct characterization of anharmonicity and disorder, establishing momentum-resolved 2DS as both a powerful diagnostic for quantum simulators and a versatile probe of correlated quantum matter.

Abstract: The inverse design of materials with specific desired properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, represents a formidable challenge in materials science due to the vastness of chemical and structural space. We present a guided diffusion framework to accelerate the discovery of novel superconductors. A DiffCSP foundation model is pretrained on the Alexandria Database and fine-tuned on 7,183 superconductors with first principles derived labels. Employing classifier-free guidance, we sample 200,000 structures, which lead to 34,027 unique candidates. A multistage screening process that combines machine learning and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess stability and electronic properties, identifies 773 candidates with DFT-calculated $T_\mathrm{c}>5$ K. Notably, our generative model demonstrates effective property-driven design. Our computational findings were validated against experimental synthesis and characterization performed as part of this work, which highlighted challenges in sparsely charted chemistries. This end-to-end workflow accelerates superconductor discovery while underscoring the challenge of predicting and synthesizing experimentally realizable materials.

Title: Order from chaos with adaptive circuits on quantum hardware
Authors: Bibek Pokharel, Haining Pan, Kemal Aziz, Luke C. G. Govia, Sriram Ganeshan, Thomas Iadecola, Justin H. Wilson, Barbara A. Jones, Abhinav Deshpande, Jedediah H. Pixley, Maika Takita
Abstract: Programmable quantum devices provide a platform to control the coherent dynamics of quantum wavefunctions. Here we experimentally realize adaptive monitored quantum circuits, which incorporate conditional feedback into non-unitary evolution, to control quantum chaotic dynamics using a combination of local mid-circuit measurements and resets. The experiments are performed with an IBM superconducting quantum processor using up to 100 qubits that samples a quantum version of the classically chaotic Bernoulli map. This map scrambles quantum information, while local measurements and feedback attempt to steer the dynamics toward a state that is a fixed point of the map. This competition drives a dynamical phase transition between quantum and classical dynamics that we observe experimentally and describe theoretically using noisy simulations, matrix product states, and mappings to statistical mechanics models. Estimates of the universal critical properties are obtained to high accuracy on the quantum computer thanks to the large number of qubits utilized in the calculation. By successfully applying up to nearly 5000 entangling gates and 5000 non-unitary mid-circuit operations on systems up to 100 qubits, this experiment serves as a signpost on the route towards fault tolerance.

Title: Light in Slices: How to Enable Precise Laser Processing?
Authors: Stefan Nolte, Jörn Bonse, Nadezhda M. Bulgakova
Abstract: Ultrashort (femtosecond, fs) laser pulses have fascinating properties as they allow to confine optical energy on extreme scales in space and time. Such fs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light that are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while simultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high peak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique tools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time required to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling, from the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse energy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via diffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence, the fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or ablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred nanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable nonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation and relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the reasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials processing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids. We identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision or the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or processing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and questions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered.

Title: Universal Numerical Simulation Model for Laser Material Processing
Authors: Andreas Otto, Michele Buttazzoni, Carlos Durán, Tobias Florian, Constantin Zenz
Abstract: High power lasers are used for a variety of manufacturing processes on time and length scales that cover many orders of magnitude and on different materials. The variety of processes achievable through laser-material interaction results from numerous coupled, nonlinear physical phenomena. Simulation models can be used to gain process understanding, explain experimentally observed phenomena, and optimize or design processes. However, the inherent complexity and diversity of the phenomena make modeling a challenging task. Within this chapter, a universal model is presented that accurately simulates a broad spectrum of processes, including welding, additive manufacturing, cutting, ablation, drilling, and surface structuring, encompassing both continuous wave and ultrashort pulsed lasers and their interaction with various materials. Starting from the fundamental principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, a continuum mechanical framework is introduced that captures the main multiphysical effects. A numerical solution using the Finite Volume Method is presented and validated against benchmark problems where detailed experimental data are available. Macroscopic examples with continuous wave lasers include keyhole drilling and collapse under stationary illumination as well as melt pool dynamics and pore formation in copper welding. At the microscopic level, copper ablation with femtosecond pulses is simulated. Finally, a set of real-world applications is shown, where the model helps to explain and optimize industrial phenomena and defects. Examples include deep penetration welding of steel with dynamic beam shaping, multilayer additive manufacturing via powder bed fusion, and ultrashort pulsed drilling of micro vias in dielectric materials.

Title: A Comparison of Surrogate Constitutive Models for Viscoplastic Creep Simulation of HT-9 Steel
Authors: Pieterjan Robbe, Andre Ruybalid, Arun Hegde, Christophe Bonneville, Habib N Najm, Laurent Capolungo, Cosmin Safta
Abstract: Mechanistic microstructure-informed constitutive models for the mechanical response of polycrystals are a cornerstone of computational materials science. However, as these models become increasingly more complex - often involving coupled differential equations describing the effect of specific deformation modes - their associated computational costs can become prohibitive, particularly in optimization or uncertainty quantification tasks that require numerous model evaluations. To address this challenge, surrogate constitutive models that balance accuracy and computational efficiency are highly desirable. Data-driven surrogate models, that learn the constitutive relation directly from data, have emerged as a promising solution. In this work, we develop two local surrogate models for the viscoplastic response of a steel: a piecewise response surface method and a mixture of experts model. These surrogates are designed to adapt to complex material behavior, which may vary with material parameters or operating conditions. The surrogate constitutive models are applied to creep simulations of HT-9 steel, an alloy of considerable interest to the nuclear energy sector due to its high tolerance to radiation damage, using training data generated from viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) simulations. We define a set of test metrics to numerically assess the accuracy of our surrogate models for predicting viscoplastic material behavior, and show that the mixture of experts model outperforms the piecewise response surface method in terms of accuracy.

Title: A Hybrid Optimal Velocity Drag Model for Traffic Flow Dynamics
Authors: Nizhum Rahman, Trachette L. Jackson
Abstract: We develop a Hybrid Optimal Velocity-Drag (OVD) model that combines the behavioral structure of the classical Optimal Velocity Model (OVM) with a drag-based saturation law motivated by Newtonian mechanics. The model retains the OVM principle that desired speed depends on headway, but replaces the linear relaxation law with a formulation that enforces bounded accelerations and smooth convergence to equilibrium. After reviewing the OVM framework and its stability properties, we introduce the OVD dynamics and derive the dispersion relation from a linear stability analysis of uniform flow. This analysis shows that the OVD formulation preserves the instability mechanisms responsible for stop-and-go waves, while avoiding the unrealistic acceleration predictions of the classical OVM. We also illustrate the model using desired velocity functions of hyperbolic tangent type, a common choice in the OVM literature, and highlight applications to large-scale traffic simulation and empirical data studies. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the OVD model enforces bounded accelerations while preserving the nonlinear instabilities of the classical OVM, providing a physically grounded and interpretable foundation for advancing traffic flow research.

Title: Universality of Shallow Global Quenches in Critical Spin Chains
Authors: Julia Wei, Méabh Allen, Jack Kemp, Chenbing Wang, Zixia Wei, Joel E. Moore, Norman Y. Yao
Abstract: Measuring universal data in the strongly correlated regime of quantum critical points remains a fundamental objective for quantum simulators. In foundational work, Calabrese and Cardy demonstrated how this data governs the dynamics of certain global quenches to 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories. While the quasiparticle picture they introduce has been widely successful in both theory and experiment, their seminal prediction that the critical exponents are simply encoded in the relaxation rates of local observables is more challenging to investigate experimentally; in particular, the specific initial state required for their analysis is generated via imaginary time evolution. In this work, we examine the critical quench dynamics of local observables from two types of readily-accessible initial conditions: ground states and finite-temperature ensembles. We identify universal scaling collapses and scaling functions in both cases, utilizing a combination of conformal perturbation theory and tensor network numerics. For the finite-temperature quenches, we determine a regime in which the conformal field theory results are recovered, thereby allowing universal quantum critical data to be extracted from realistic quenches.

Title: Entanglement and apparent thermality in simulated black holes
Authors: Iason A. Sofos, Andrew Hallam, Jiannis K. Pachos
Abstract: We investigate the apparent thermality of Hawking radiation in the semi-classical limit of quantum black holes using the mean-field limit of a chiral spin-chain simulator, which models fermions propagating on a black hole space-time in the continuum. In this free-theory regime, no genuine thermalisation occurs. Nevertheless, we show that a bipartition across the event horizon yields a reduced density matrix whose mode occupations follow an apparent thermal Fermi-Dirac distribution. In contrast, partitions away from the horizon do not exhibit thermal behaviour, reflecting the absence of true equilibration. Our results demonstrate that Hawking radiation appears thermal only with respect to horizon bipartitions in free theories, while true thermal behaviour emerges only in the presence of interactions deep in the black hole interior.

Title: BCS superconductivity in the presence of wave dark matter
Authors: Yechan Kim, Hye-Sung Lee, Jiheon Lee, Jaeok Yi
Abstract: In the established era of dark matter, condensed matter Hamiltonians-including those of superconductors-may require extension to account for the surrounding Galactic environment. We show that if dark matter is wave-like and couples weakly to electrons, superconducting parameters such as the gap and critical temperature become dynamical quantities that oscillate in time. This modifies the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer framework and produces distinctive temporal signatures whose sensitivity increases with longer measurement durations. Our results illustrate how condensed matter systems, traditionally treated as isolated from their cosmological environment, may acquire new dynamical degrees of freedom from their cosmic embedding. This, in turn, offers a novel window into the dark sector.

Title: A modular framework for collaborative human-AI, multi-modal and multi-beamline synchrotron experiments
Authors: Adam A. Corrao, Phillip M. Maffettone, Bruce Ravel, Thomas A. Caswell, Howie Joress, Stuart I. Wilkins, Daniel Olds
Abstract: High-throughput materials discovery and studies of complex functional materials increasingly rely on multi-modal characterization performed at synchrotron light sources. However, measurements are typically done with no use of data until after an experiment, neglecting opportunities for data-driven insights to guide measurements. We developed a modular, open-source framework that incorporates artificial intelligence within the Bluesky control and data streaming infrastructure at NSLS-II, enabling real-time orchestration of multi-beamline, multi-modal experiments. AI agents perform on-the-fly reduction, clustering, Gaussian process modelling, and Bayesian optimization driven data acquisition, while users monitor agent behavior and visualize results live. Combinatorial libraries of the ternary Al-Ni-Pt system were spatially mapped by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements at the PDF and BMM beamlines, respectively. Dynamic switching between AI-driven and conventional grid mapping strategies was achieved, demonstrating the flexible workflows possible through this framework. A digital twin constructed from a simulated Al-Li-Fe oxide dataset shows that AI-driven mapping strategies outperform conventional mapping as well as random sampling by prioritizing measurements that better resolve both phase boundaries and localized minority phases. This framework supports plug-and-play capabilities, and establishes a foundation for routine multi-modal, AI-assisted large-scale user-facility operations.

Title: Angular Resolution Enhancement of Electron Backscatter Diffraction Patterns
Authors: Ben Britton, Tianbi Zhang
Abstract: We present a simple 'shift-and-add' based improvement in the angular resolution of single electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns. Sub-pixel image registration is used to measure the (sub-pixel) difference in projection parameters for patterns collected within a map, and then the pattern is shifted and added together. The resultant EBSD-pattern is shown to contain more angular information than a long-exposure single pattern, via 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based analysis. In particular, this method has the potential to enhance the scope of small compact direct electron detectors (DEDs).

Title: IsingFormer: Augmenting Parallel Tempering With Learned Proposals
Authors: Saleh Bunaiyan, Corentin Delacour, Shuvro Chowdhury, Kyle Lee, Kerem Y. Camsari
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures, including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses (optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes. Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems, IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution. Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.

Title: Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Atma Anand
Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2 K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

Title: Room-temperature quantum entanglement in a van der Waals material
Authors: Xingyu Gao, Zhun Ge, Saakshi Dikshit, Sumukh Vaidya, Peng Ju, Tongcang Li
Abstract: Entanglement is central to quantum science and technology. Atomic defects in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials offer exciting prospects for quantum sensing, with spatial resolution reaching 1 nm demonstrated using scanning probe techniques. However, entangling qubits in vdW materials remains elusive. Here we report room-temperature quantum entanglement between an optically addressable electron spin and a strongly coupled $^{13}$C nuclear spin in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We extend the electron spin coherence to 38 $\mu$s with dynamical decoupling, and create maximally entangled Bell states with a fidelity up to 0.89. We further use the nuclear spin as a long-lived quantum memory to enhance AC magnetic field sensing via correlation spectroscopy. These results establish entangled spin qubits in hBN as a robust platform for advanced quantum technologies based on 2D materials.

Title: Surface Optimisation Governs the Local Design of Physical Networks
Authors: Xiangyi Meng, Benjamin Piazza, Csaba Both, Baruch Barzel, Albert-László Barabási
Abstract: The brain's connectome and the vascular system are examples of physical networks whose tangible nature influences their structure, layout, and ultimately their function. The material resources required to build and maintain these networks have inspired decades of research into wiring economy, offering testable predictions about their expected architecture and organisation. Here we empirically explore the local branching geometry of a wide range of physical networks, uncovering systematic violations of the long-standing predictions of length and volume minimisation. This leads to the hypothesis that predicting the true material cost of physical networks requires us to account for their full three-dimensional geometry, resulting in a largely intractable optimisation problem. We discover, however, an exact mapping of surface minimisation onto high-dimensional Feynman diagrams in string theory, predicting that with increasing link thickness, a locally tree-like network undergoes a transition into configurations that can no longer be explained by length minimisation. Specifically, surface minimisation predicts the emergence of trifurcations and branching angles in excellent agreement with the local tree organisation of physical networks across a wide range of application domains. Finally, we predict the existence of stable orthogonal sprouts, which not only are prevalent in real networks but also play a key functional role, improving synapse formation in the brain and nutrient access in plants and fungi.

Title: Development of a microwave SQUID multiplexer for magnetic microbolometers
Authors: N. Müller, J. Bonilla-Neira, J. Geria, M. García Redondo, L. Ferreyro, M. Hampel, M. Wegner, A. Almela, S. Kempf
Abstract: The search for primordial B-modes in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) requires highly sensitive and scalable detector systems. The magnetic microbolometer (MMB) is an emerging detector concept that exploits the magnetic properties of paramagnetic materials at sub-kelvin temperatures, offering bolometers with a high dynamic range and low intrinsic noise. In recent years, the microwave SQUID multiplexer ($\mu$MUX) has become a key technology to efficiently read large low temperature detector arrays, enabling the readout of hundreds to thousands of detectors over a single transmission line with low noise and minimal power dissipation while reducing the cryogenic setup complexity. In this work, we report the design, fabrication and characterization of a $\mu$MUX optimized for MMB detectors and share our latest experimental results from a bolometer prototype. These findings provide valuable insight of the $\mu$MUX in advancing next-generation CMB instrumentation and also demonstrate its suitability for novel detector technologies such as the MMB.

Title: How LLMs Learn to Reason: A Complex Network Perspective
Authors: Sihan Hu, Xiansheng Cai, Yuan Huang, Zhiyuan Yao, Linfeng Zhang, Pan Zhang, Youjin Deng, Kun Chen
Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands'' form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory, we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

Title: Haag Duality for 2D Quantum Spin Systems
Authors: Yoshiko Ogata, David Pérez-García, Alberto Ruiz-de-Alarcón
Abstract: Haag duality is a strong notion of locality for two-dimensional lattice quantum spin systems, requiring that the commutant of the algebra of observables supported in a cone-like region coincides with the algebra of observables in its complement. Originally introduced within algebraic quantum field theory, Haag duality has recently become pivotal in the operator-algebraic analysis of quantum many-body systems. In particular, it plays a key role in the description of anyonic excitations, which are widely believed to classify two-dimensional non-chiral gapped quantum phases of matter. Prior to this work, Haag duality had only been rigorously established for Kitaev's quantum double models with abelian input groups. In this paper, we establish that two-dimensional tensor network states based on biconnected $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras satisfy Haag duality. These states include as particular cases Kitaev quantum double and Levin-Wen string-net models, and we expect them to encompass representatives of all non-chiral phases. Our proof relies on deriving an operator-algebraic sufficient condition for Haag duality in finite systems, which we verify using tensor-network methods. As part of our analysis, we extend the tensor-network bulk-boundary correspondence, construct explicit commuting parent Hamiltonians for these models, and prove that in the biconnected case they satisfy the local topological quantum order condition.

Title: Integrable Spherical Brane Model at Large $N$
Authors: Mohsen Gheisarieha, Ramtin M. Yazdi, Arash Arabi Ardehali
Abstract: We study one of the simplest integrable two-dimensional quantum field theories with a boundary: $N$ free non-compact scalars in the bulk, constrained non-linearly on the boundary to lie on an $(N-1)$-sphere of radius $1/\sqrt{g}$. The $N=1$ case reduces to the single-channel Kondo problem, while larger $N$ is analogous to multi-channel or higher-spin impurity scenarios. Adding a boundary magnetic field -- a linear boundary coupling to the scalars -- enriches the model's structure while preserving integrability. Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov (2004) conjectured an expansion for the boundary free energy on the infinite half-cylinder in powers of the magnetic field. Using large-$N$ saddle-point techniques, we confirm their conjecture to next-to-leading order in $1/N$. Renormalization of the subleading solution turns out to be highly instructive, and we connect it to the RG running of $g$ studied by Giombi and Khanchandani (2020).

Title: Non-Abelian interference of topological edge states
Authors: Shi Hu, Meiqing Hu, Zhoutao Lei
Abstract: Topological boundary states exhibit distinctive properties, including unidirectional propagation and noise robustness, which hold significant potential for advancing the performance of quantum science and technology. Here, we demonstrate the implementation of non-Abelian quantum interference and entanglement generation, protected by dual symmetries (time-independent inversion and time-dependent interchain), in coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains. Specifically, in a multi-chain system, we first achieve tunable topological transfer of a single particle, where the destination chain is selected by the braiding sequence. We then extend this to two particles, observing a non-Abelian Hong-Ou-Mandel interference that generates spatially entangled NOON states whose properties are dictated by the braiding order. Our work establishes an alternative pathway for exploring non-Abelian topology applied to quantum science and technology, enabled by the unique protection of time-dependent symmetry.

Title: Experimental study of diffusiophoresis in a cellular flow
Authors: Florence Raynal, Menghua Zhao, Romain Volk
Abstract: In this article, we study experimentally the dispersion of colloids in a two-dimensional, time independent, Rayleigh-Bénard flow in the presence of salt gradients. Due to the additional scalar, the colloids do not follow exactly the Eulerian flow-field, but have a (small) extra-velocity $\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{dp}} = D_{\mathrm{dp}} \nabla \log C_s$, where $D_\mathrm{dp}$ is the phoretic constant and $C_s$ the salt concentration. Such a configuration is motivated by the theoretical work by Volk \textit{et al.} (JFM, 2022), which predicted enhanced transport or blockage in a stationary cellular flow depending on the value of a blockage coefficient. By means of High Dynamical Range Light Induced Fluorescence, we study the evolution of the colloids concentration field at large Péclet number. We find a good agreement with the theoretical work although a number of hypotheses are not satisfied, as the experiment is non homogeneous in space and intrinsically transient. In particular we observe enhanced transport when salt and colloids are injected at both ends of the Rayleigh-Bénard chamber, and blockage when colloids and salt are injected together and phoretic effects are strong enough.

Title: Rapid and Cost-Effective In situ Fabrication of Nanoporous Membranes in Microfluidic Devices for Biomedical and Environmental Applications
Authors: Arijit Mohanta, Zakia Farhat, Yeshudan Bora, Saurabh Dubey, Nafisa Arfa, Dipankar Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: Micro/nanoporous membranes have been used extensively in biological and medical applications associated with filtration, particle sorting, cell separation, and real-time sensing. Expanding its applications to microfluidics offers several advantages, such as precise control over fluid flow rates, regulated reaction times, and efficient product extraction. This study demonstrates a simple, cost-effective, rapid, single-step method for the synthesis of nanoporous membranes within a microfluidic device. The membrane is prepared by filling up the microchamber with cellulose acetate dissolved in N, N-dimethylformamide, and 1-hexanol, followed by the continuous flow of water as an antisolvent. Mixing CA-DMF with antisolvent water leads to an in-situ synthesis of cellulose acetate nanoparticles (CANPs) at the Water-DMF interface. The continuous flow of water ensures the coagulation of CANPs, forming nanoporous membranes. The thickness, porosity, and wettability of the membrane are dependent on the flow rate of water and the concentration of CA dissolved in DMF. Apart from its wide application in cell and biomolecule separation, this membrane can be used to detect biomarkers or pathogens in clinical samples. Additionally, these nanoporous membranes can be used to detect and filter environmental contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and emulsified oil from water. In summary, the synthesis of CANP nanoporous membranes within microfluidic channels with adjustable porosity enhances the potential uses of micro/nanomembranes in both healthcare and environmental contexts.

Title: Diffusion Models are Kelly Gamblers
Authors: Akhil Premkumar
Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum mechanics.

Title: General Framework for Twisted Bilayer Photonic Crystal with Interlayer Coupling and Far-Field Response
Authors: Shupeng Xu, Dun Wang, Ritesh Agarwal
Abstract: We develop a general theory for twisted bilayer photonic crystals that takes into account both far-field response and near-field coupling. The theory is based on the framework of a generalized Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. A universal form for interlayer coupling is derived, which relates the hopping strength to the Fourier transforms of the Wannier functions in the single layer photonic crystal. For low energy states at the K point in hexagonal lattices, the interlayer coupling reduces to that in the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for graphene. As an example, we study a twisted bilayer photonic crystal slab with air holes arranged in a honeycomb lattice in each layer. The first order solution of our model predicts a four-fold band splitting in the far-field spectrum compared to the single-layer case, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, our theory reveals that for low energy states at K points, scattering towards the {\Gamma} point via the moiré potential is suppressed. Based on our theory, we propose a wide-angle, high-Q tunable flat band cavity by combining the bilayer at a large twist angle with a Brillouinzone-folding perturbation within each layer. The cavity behaves like a collection of quasi-bound states in the continuum with a divergent density of states, with potential applications in nonlinear optics, lasing and quantum optics.

Title: Population genetics in complex ecological communities
Authors: Shing Yan Li, Zhijie Feng, Akshit Goyal, Pankaj Mehta
Abstract: Ecological interactions can dramatically alter evolutionary outcomes in complex communities. Yet, the classic theoretical results of population genetics (e.g., Kimura's fixation formula) largely ignore ecological effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by using dynamical mean-field theory to integrate ecology into classical population genetics models. We show that ecological interactions between parents and mutants result in frequency-dependent selection and can be characterized by a single emergent parameter that measures the strength of ecological feedbacks. We derive an explicit analytic expression for the fixation probability that generalizes Kimura's famous result and analyze it in various ecological and evolutionary limits. We find that ecological interactions suppress fixation probabilities for moderately beneficial mutants when compared to Kimura's predictions, with the strength of suppression increasing with larger effective population sizes, greater selective differences between parent and mutant, and for ecosystems with a large number of "open niches" (i.e., ecosystems well below the packing bound). Frequency-dependent selection also gives rise to prolonged parent-mutant coexistence in complex communities, a phenomenon absent in classical population genetics. Our study establishes a framework for integrating ecological interactions into population genetics models and helps illuminate how ecology can affect evolutionary outcomes.

Title: Decoupling hydrodynamization from thermalization via nonlinear Boltzmann equation
Authors: Xingjian Lu, Shuzhe Shi
Abstract: The early thermalization puzzle arises from the unexpectedly early applicability of hydrodynamics in heavy-ion collisions. While hydrodynamics has traditionally been associated with the onset of local thermal equilibrium, its derivations -- whether microscopic or macroscopic -- rely instead on linearization around equilibrium. However, the linearization timescale -- the time at which a system's evolution begins to follow a linearized equation -- has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we employ the spectral nonlinear Boltzmann equation -- the lowest-order truncation of the spectral Bogoliubov--Born--Green--Kirkwood--Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy -- to analyze the timescales of linearization and thermalization under three distinct truncation schemes. The first two truncations allow for analytic treatment via recursive spectral equations, while the third requires numerical methods for generic initial conditions. The analysis is performed for a homogeneous, massless system with a constant differential cross section. For this simplified setup, we find a robust separation: the linearization time is consistently about half the thermalization time ($\tau_{\mathrm{lin}}/\tau_{\mathrm{therm}} \approx 1/2$). This separation of timescales suggests an explanation for the early applicability of hydrodynamics and points toward a possible quantitative resolution of the early thermalization puzzle.

Authors: Evan Dramko, Yihuang Xiong, Yizhi Zhu, Geoffroy Hautier, Thomas Reps, Christopher Jermaine, Anastasios Kyrillidis
Abstract: Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials. First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However, these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.

Title: Magnon squeezing near a quantum critical point in a cavity-magnon-qubit system
Authors: Gang Liu, Gen Li, Rong-Can Yang, Wei Xiong, Jie Li
Abstract: Preparing magnon nonclassical states is a central topic in the study of quantum magnonics. Here we propose to generate magnon squeezed states in a hybrid cavity-magnon-qubit system by engineering an effective Rabi-type magnon-qubit interaction. This is achieved by adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode and driving the qubit with two microwave fields, of which the driving frequencies and amplitudes are properly selected. By operating the system around the critical point associated with the ground-state superradiant phase transition in the normal phase, a magnon parametric amplification-like interaction is induced, leading to a dynamical magnon squeezing. We further analyze the effects of the dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on the magnon squeezing. Our results indicate that a moderate degree of squeezing can be produced using currently available parameters in the experiments.

Title: Quantum Zeno Effect in the Spatial Evolution of a Single Atom
Authors: Zheng-Yuan Zhang, Han-Chao Chen, Xin Liu, Li-Hua Zhang, Bang Liu, Shi-Yao Shao, Jun Zhang, Qi-Feng Wang, Qing Li, Yu Ma, Tian-Yu Han, Ya-Jun Wang, Dong-Yang Zhu, Jia-Dou Nan, Yi-Ming Yin, Qiao-Qiao Fang, Dong-Sheng Ding, Bao-Sen Shi
Abstract: The quantum Zeno effect (QZE) reveals that frequent measurements can suppress quantum evolution, but the detailed dynamics of the system under finite-duration measurements in experiments remain insufficiently explored. Here, we employ an optical dipole trap as a projective measurement to study the motion of a single cold atom in free space. By monitoring atomic loss, we directly observe the QZE in single-atom motion in free space and find that the effect of dipole measurements on the atom comprises a short-time collapse followed by subsequent periodic unitary evolution, thereby providing an intuitive physical picture of measurement backaction across different timescales. We further investigate the effects of measurement frequency, strength, and spatial position, demonstrating that measurements not only suppress the spreading of quantum states but also enable deterministic preparation of distinct motional states. Furthermore, by dynamically controlling the measurement position, we achieve measurement-induced directional transport of a single atom without imparting additional momentum. Our results provide a direct experimental demonstration of the QZE in real space and establish a versatile framework for measurement-based control of atomic motion, paving the way for motional-state engineering in cold-atom platforms.

Title: Non-epitaxial perovskite polariton laser diode operating under direct current

Abstract: Reaching lasing in electrically pumped microdevices based on solution-processed semiconductors poses a major scientific and technological challenge. Halide perovskites offer a promising platform for electrical injection, since their optically excited single-crystal cavities and predesigned or postprocessed microstructures have exhibited low lasing threshold. Indirect electrical pumping of a dual-cavity perovskite laser was recently obtained, utilizing a well-established technological concept of embedding a high-luminosity light-emitting diode (LED) with a high-gain medium into an integrated device. Direct charge-carrier injection into a perovskite LED excited by auxiliary short-, optical-pulses resulted into amplified spontaneous emission. Other efforts for rational engineering of architectures that allow for high charge-carrier density are still to demonstrate lasing. Here, we develop a novel strategy for achieving direct electrical pumping of a perovskite laser. We integrate a solution-grown CsPbBr3 microplate with chemically inert single-walled carbon nanotube electrodes and embed them into an optical microcavity. By cooling the microdevice down to 8 K at a constant current, a perovskite p-i-n diode is formed that facilitates a balanced carrier injection at high current densities. The perovskite microcavity diode operates in the strong coupling regime, exhibiting polariton lasing under a direct current of 65 uA.

Authors: Xueyuan Yan
Abstract: We develop a numerical approach based on the sinc basis set for first-principles electronic structure calculations in one-dimensional systems. The method exploits the inherent accuracy and non-local character of the sinc functions to handle long-range couplings effectively. As a proof of principle, we provide a computational study of a molecule in an optical cavity, with our code directly calculating the emergence of the energy level splitting in the spectrum.

Title: An operator-Weyl-symbol approach to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis
Authors: Xiao Wang, Wen-ge Wang
Abstract: In this letter, by an approach that employs Weyl symbols for operators, a semiclassical theory is developed for the offdiagonal function in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which is for offdiagonal elements $\langle{E_i}\left|O\right|{E_j}\rangle$ of an observable $O$ on the energy basis. It is shown analytically that the matrix of $O$ has a banded structure, possessing a bandwidth $w_b$ that scales linearly with $\hbar$, a phase-space gradient of the classical Hamiltonian, $\langle\left|{\boldsymbol{\nabla }H_{\rm cl}}\right|\rangle$, and an $O$-dependent property. This predicts that the thermalization timescale of a quantum system may be inversely proportional to the phase-space gradient of the Hamiltonian, aligning with intuitions in classical thermalization. This approach also elucidates the origin of a $\rho_{\rm dos}^{-1/2}$-scaling of the offdiagonal function. The analytical predictions are checked numerically in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.

Title: Generation of C-band entangled photon pairs by biexciton-exciton cascade from symmetric InAs/InP quantum dots
Authors: Anna Musiał, Maja Wasiluk, Katarzyna Roszak, Michał Gawełczyk, Wojciech Rudno-Rudziński, Paweł Wyborski, Johann P. Reithmaier, Mohamed Benyoucef, Grzegorz Sęk
Abstract: Hereby, we study the generation of pairs of polarization-entangled photons at telecom C-band by biexciton-exciton cascade from non-resonantly excited epitaxial InAs/InP quantum dots (QDs). It is realized without external tuning of the fine structure splitting (FSS), which does not exceed 10 $\mu$eV in as-grown nanostructures, due to their high in-plane symmetry. Excitonic complexes are identified by means of excitation power-dependent and polarization-resolved magneto)microphotoluminescence. Their origin from different carrier configurations confined in the same QD is confirmed by time correlations of emitted photons. Experimental results are supported by 8-band kp calculations, followed by the configuration interaction method to include excitonic effects. This comparison reveals the structure of higher energy states, allowing for the reconstruction of the QD structural parameters. To verify and quantify the entanglement, we perform quantum state tomography and reconstruct the two-photon density matrix. Its diagonalization allows a detailed analysis of the entangled state and reveals an unfavourable interplay between phase accumulation and decoherence, pointing to a clear route for boosting entanglement by using a XX resonant, pulsed excitation scheme and shortening the radiative lifetimes.

Title: Measurement-induced phase transition in interacting bosons from most likely quantum trajectory
Authors: Anna Delmonte, Zejian Li, Rosario Fazio, Alessandro Romito
Abstract: We propose a new theoretical method to describe the monitored dynamics of bosonic many-body systems based on the concept of the most likely trajectory. We show how such trajectory can be identified from the probability distribution of quantum trajectories, i.e. measurement readouts, and how it successfully captures the monitored dynamics beyond the average state. We prove the method to be exact in the case of Gaussian theories and then extend it to the interacting Sine-Gordon model. Although no longer exact in this framework, the method captures the dynamics through a self-consistent time-dependent harmonic approximation and reveals an entanglement phase transition in the steady state from an area-law to a logarithmic-law scaling.

Title: Birth of a gap: Critical phenomena in 2D Coulomb gas
Authors: Matthias Allard, Sampad Lahiry
Abstract: We investigate a family of radially symmetric Coulomb gas systems at inverse temperature $\beta = 2$. The family is characterised by the property that the density of the equilibrium measure vanishes on a ring at radius $r_*$, which lies strictly inside the droplet. The large $n$ expansion of the logarithm of the partition function is obtained up to a novel $n^{1/4}$ term. We perform a double scaling limit of the correlation kernel at the $n^{1/4}$ scale and obtain a new limiting kernel in the bulk, which differs from the well-known Ginibre kernel.

Title: Non-destructive optical read-out and manipulation of circular Rydberg atoms
Authors: Yohann Machu, Andrés Durán-Hernández, Gautier Creutzer, Aurore Alice Young, Jean-Michel Raimond, Michel Brune, Clément Sayrin
Abstract: Among the thriving quantum computation and quantum simulation platforms based on arrays of Rydberg atoms, those using circular Rydberg atoms are particularly promising. These atoms uniquely combine the strong dipole-dipole interactions typical of Rydberg states with long lifetimes. However, low-angular-momentum ($\ell$) laser-accessible Rydberg levels have been so far mostly used, because circular Rydberg atoms have no optical transitions, hindering their individual detection and manipulation. We remove this limitation with a hybrid platform, combining an array of logical laser-trapped circular Rydberg atoms of rubidium with an auxiliary array of Rb ancilla atoms transiently excited to a low-$\ell$ Rydberg level. We perform a quantum non-demolition detection of the logical qubit with the ancilla, through the blockade of the ancilla optical excitation induced by a Förster resonance. Conversely, we locally manipulate the logical qubit through the excitation of the ancilla. This dual-Rydberg platform is highly promising for quantum computation and simulation. It adds to the circular-atom toolbox the mid-circuit measurements, essential for error correction. More strikingly, it gives access to time correlations in long-term quantum simulations, uniquely accessible to circular Rydberg atoms.

Title: A Quantum Computer Based on Donor-Cluster Arrays in Silicon
Authors: Shihang Zhang, Chunhui Zhang, Guanyong Wang, Tao Xin, Guangchong Hu, Yu He, Peihao Huang
Abstract: Significant advances in silicon spin qubits highlight the potential of silicon quantum dots for scalable quantum computing, given their compatibility with industrial fabrication and long coherence times. In particular, phosphorus (P)-doped spin qubits possess excellent coherence and have demonstrated high-fidelity two-qubit gates exceeding 99.9%. However, scaling P-donor systems is challenging due to crosstalk caused by the uniformity of individual P donors and the low tolerance for imprecise atomic placement. Stochastic placement can lead to multiple donors located within a small region (diameter <3 nm), forming a so-called donor cluster. Notably, in cluster-based systems, high-fidelity multi-qubit quantum gates and all-to-all connectivity have recently been demonstrated experimentally on nuclear spin qubits. In this work, we propose a scalable cluster-array architecture for nuclear spin qubits and a corresponding control protocol. We analyze crosstalk-induced errors, a major error source, during primitive operations under various parameters, showing that they can be suppressed through device design and control optimization. We evaluate the fidelities of intra- and inter-cluster multi-qubit gates between nuclear spins, confirming the feasibility of our architecture and establishing design requirements and parameter targets. The local all-to-all connectivity within clusters provides unique flexibility for quantum error correction. Our scalable scheme provides a path toward large-scale spin-based quantum processors.

Title: Demonstration of quantum error detection in a silicon quantum processor

Abstract: Quantum error detection is essential in realizing large-scale universal quantum computation, especially for quantum error correction (QEC). However, key elements for FTQC have yet to be realized in silicon qubits. Here, we demonstrate quantum error detection on a donor-based silicon quantum processor comprising four-nuclear spin qubits and one electron spin as an auxiliary qubit. The entanglement capability of this system is validated through the establishment of two-qubit Bell state entanglement between the nuclear spins and the generation of a four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, achieving a GHZ state fidelity of 88.5(2.3)%. Furthermore, by executing a four-qubit error detection circuit with the stabilizers, we successfully detect arbitrary single-qubit errors. The encoded Bell state entanglement information is recovered by performing the Pauli-frame update (PFU) via postprocessing. Based on the detected errors, we identify strongly biased noise in our system. Our results mark a significant advance toward FTQC in silicon spin qubits.

Title: Collision types and times in interacting particle systems
Authors: Sergio Andraus, Nicole Hufnagel, Jacek Małecki
Abstract: We consider a system of stochastic interacting particles with general diffusion coefficient and drift functions and we study the types of collisions that arise in them. In particular, interactions between particles are inversely proportional to their separation, and the coupling function of interaction is also considered in great generality. Our main result indicates that under very mild conditions, all collisions are simple almost surely, namely, only one pair of particles collides at any time, while more complicated collisions such as three-body or disjoint two-body collisions occur with zero probability. In order to obtain our results we make use of symmetric polynomials on the square of particle separations; the degree of these polynomials indicates the type of collision, and by a locality argument we show that polynomials indicating a non-simple collision almost surely do not cancel. We make use of our main result to study the Hausdorff dimension of times at which collisions occur, and we show that this dimension is given by the ratio between the interaction coupling and diffusion functions. Our results cover many of the most well-known particle systems, such as the Dyson model and Wishart processes and their extensions to non-constant diffusion coefficients and background drifts.

Title: Scaling Laws and Spectra of Shallow Neural Networks in the Feature Learning Regime
Authors: Leonardo Defilippis, Yizhou Xu, Julius Girardin, Emanuele Troiani, Vittorio Erba, Lenka Zdeborová, Bruno Loureiro, Florent Krzakala
Abstract: Neural scaling laws underlie many of the recent advances in deep learning, yet their theoretical understanding remains largely confined to linear models. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of scaling laws for quadratic and diagonal neural networks in the feature learning regime. Leveraging connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, we derive a detailed phase diagram for the scaling exponents of the excess risk as a function of sample complexity and weight decay. This analysis uncovers crossovers between distinct scaling regimes and plateau behaviors, mirroring phenomena widely reported in the empirical neural scaling literature. Furthermore, we establish a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained network weights, which we characterize in detail. As a consequence, we provide a theoretical validation of recent empirical observations connecting the emergence of power-law tails in the weight spectrum with network generalization performance, yielding an interpretation from first principles.

Abstract: We present a topology grounded, multiscale simulation platform for morphogenesis and biological active matter. Morphogenesis and biological active matter represent keystone problems in biology with additional, far-reaching implications across the biomedical sciences. Addressing these problems will require flexible, cross-scale models of tissue shape, development, and dysfunction that can be tuned to understand, model, and predict relevant individual cases. Current approaches to simulating anatomical or cellular subsystems tend to rely on static, assumed shapes. Meanwhile, the potential for topology to provide natural dimensionality reduction and organization of shape and dynamical outcomes is not fully exploited. TopoSPAM combines ease of use with powerful simulation algorithms and methodological advances, including active nematic gels, topological-defect-driven shape dynamics, and an active 3D vertex model of tissues. It is capable of determining emergent flows and shapes across scales.

Title: Inductive Bias and Spectral Properties of Single-Head Attention in High Dimensions
Authors: Fabrizio Boncoraglio, Vittorio Erba, Emanuele Troiani, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborová
Abstract: We study empirical risk minimization in a single-head tied-attention layer trained on synthetic high-dimensional sequence tasks, given by the recently introduced attention-indexed model. Using tools from random matrix theory, spin-glass physics, and approximate message passing, we derive sharp asymptotics for training and test errors, locate interpolation and recovery thresholds, and characterize the limiting spectral distribution of the learned weights. Weight decay induces an implicit nuclear-norm regularization, favoring low-rank query and key matrices. Leveraging this, we compare the standard factorized training of query and key matrices with a direct parameterization in which their product is trained element-wise, revealing the inductive bias introduced by the factorized form. Remarkably, the predicted spectral distribution echoes empirical trends reported in large-scale transformers, offering a theoretical perspective consistent with these phenomena.

Title: Cryogenic pressure sensing with an ultrafast Meissner-levitated microrotor
Authors: Joel K Jose, Andrea Marchese, Marion Cromb, Hendrik Ulbricht, Andrejs Cebers, Ping Koy Lam, Tao Wang, Andrea Vinante
Abstract: Magnetically levitated spinning rotors are key elements in important technologies such as navigation by gyroscopes, energy storage by flywheels, ultra-high vacuum generation by turbomolecular pumps, and pressure sensing for process control. However, mechanical rotors are typically macroscopic and limited to room temperature and low rotation frequencies. In particular, sensing pressure at low temperatures remains a technological challenge, while emerging quantum technologies demand a precise evaluation of pressure conditions at low temperatures to cope with quantum-spoiling decoherence. To close this gap, we demonstrate wide range pressure sensing by a spinning rotor based on a micromagnet levitated by the Meissner effect at 4.2 Kelvin. We achieve rotational speeds of up to 138 million rotations per minute, resulting in very high effective quality factors, outperforming current platforms. Beside sensing applications, we envision the use of levitated rotors for probing fundamental science including quantum mechanics and gravity, enabled by ultralow torque noise.

Title: ChromRec: Directional Recognition-Driven Self-Assembly of Histone Octamer and Chromatin Fiber
Authors: Hesam Arabzadeh, Dmitri Kireev
Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center Recognition potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.

Title: Agentic Exploration of Physics Models
Authors: Maximilian Nägele, Florian Marquardt
Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

Title: Effective Free Energy Landscapes and Hawking-Page Transitions
Authors: Choon-Lin Ho
Abstract: A recent interesting development on the dynamics of black hole phase transitions, the Hawking-Page transition, has been the so-called Gibbs free energy landscape approach. In this formalism, it is assumed that there exists a canonical ensemble of a series of black hole spacetimes with arbitrary horizon radius at a given ensemble temperature. An off-shell Gibbs free energy is defined for every spacetime state in the ensemble, with the horizon radius treated as the order parameter. The minima (maxima) of this function correspond to the various stable (unstable) black hole states. This off-shell Gibbs free energy is then treated as a classical effective drift potential of an associated Fokker-Planck equation used to study the stochastic dynamics of black hole phase transition under thermal fluctuations. Additive noise, which is independent of the black hole size, is assumed in obtaining the Fokker-Planck equation. In this work we extend the previous treatment by considering the effects of multiplicative noise, namely, noise that could scale with black hole size. This leads to an effective free energy function that can be used to study the modification of the Hawking-Page transition of a black hole system. It is realized that it is generally difficult to form black holes under a multiplicative noise, unless the effective and the original free energy become extremal at the same horizon radius. For this latter situation some theoretical noise profiles which are monotonically increasing/deceasing functions of the horizon radius are considered. It is found that stronger noise disfavors the formation of black hole.

Title: Enhancing work-extraction in quantum batteries via correlated reservoirs
Authors: Sejal Ahuja, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: Going beyond isolated system dynamics, we examine how local and spatially correlated reservoirs influence the work extraction in quantum batteries. By employing a one-dimensional spin-1/2 model coupled to baths via dephasing and amplitude-damping noise, we demonstrate that correlations in reservoirs can significantly enhance battery's performance compared to local noise. In the dephasing scenario, we prove that correlated reservoirs produce a finite amount of extractable work, or ergotropy, during the transient regime when a two-cell battery is initialized in a product state while local noise yields vanishing ergotropy at all times, despite nonvanishing stored energy in both cases. Numerical simulations confirm that this advantage persists across larger system sizes and for both entangled and product initial states. We also find that the dynamics of quantum coherence closely mirror those of ergotropy, highlighting coherence as a key resource underlying the enhanced performance of quantum batteries. Further, we observe that the fraction of stored energy extracted from quantum batteries displays a sharper contrast between the correlated and local reservoirs. Moreover, for dephasing noise, this fraction remains independent of system size, whereas in the amplitude damping case, it exhibits a clear system-size dependence within the transient regime, highlighting distinct operational behaviors under different noise models. In addition, we reveal that when the battery dynamics is governed by an effective Hamiltonian with long-range interactions, it yields higher ergotropy compared to short-range interactions, emphasizing the advantages of reservoir engineering for efficient device design.

Title: Highly Efficient Room-Temperature Nonvolatile Magnetic Switching by Current in Fe3GaTe2 Thin Flakes
Authors: Shaohua Yan, Shangjie Tian, Yang Fu, Fanyu Meng, Zhiteng Li, Hechang Lei, Shouguo Wang, Xiao Zhang
Abstract: Effectively tuning magnetic state by using current is essential for novel spintronic devices. Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have shown superior properties for the applications of magnetic information storage based on the efficient spin torque effect. However, for most of known vdW ferromagnets, the ferromagnetic transition temperatures lower than room temperature strongly impede their applications and the room-temperature vdW spintronic device with low energy consumption is still a long-sought goal. Here, we realize the highly efficient room-temperature nonvolatile magnetic switching by current in a single-material device based on vdW ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. Moreover, the switching current density and power dissipation are about 300 and 60000 times smaller than conventional spin-orbit-torque devices of magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures. These findings make an important progress on the applications of magnetic vdW materials in the fields of spintronics and magnetic information storage.

Title: Information theory for data-driven model reduction in physics and biology
Authors: Matthew S. Schmitt, Maciej Koch-Janusz, Michel Fruchart, Daniel S. Seara, Michael Rust, Vincenzo Vitelli
Abstract: Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop an approach to identify relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future, using the so-called information bottleneck. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. In the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our results provide a firm foundation to interpret deep learning tools that automatically identify reduced variables. Combined with equation learning methods this procedure yields the hidden dynamical rules governing the system's evolution in a data-driven manner. We illustrate how these tools work in diverse settings including model chaotic and quasiperiodic systems in which we also learn the underlying dynamical equations, uncurated satellite recordings of atmospheric fluid flows, and experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.

Title: Twisting Hubbard into the Momentum-Mixing Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model
Authors: Peizhi Mai, Jinchao Zhao, Gaurav Tenkila, Nico A. Hackner, Dhruv Kush, Derek Pan, Philip W. Phillips
Abstract: The Hubbard model is a standard theoretical tool for studying materials with strong electron-electron interactions, such as the cuprate superconductors. Unfortunately, interaction-driven phenomena such as the transition into the strongly correlated Mott insulator phase are difficult to treat with established theoretical techniques. However, the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto model displays similar Mott physics. Here we show how the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model can be deformed continuously into the Hubbard model. The trick is to systematically re-introduce all the momentum mixing the original Hatsugai-Kohmoto model omits. This can be accomplished by grouping $n$-momenta into a cell and hybridizing them resulting in the momentum-mixing Hatsugai-Kohmoto (MMHK) model. We recover the Bethe ansatz ground state energy of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to within 1$\%$ from only ten mixed momenta. Overall the convergence scales as $1/n^2$ as opposed to the inverse linear behaviour of standard finite-cluster techniques. Our results for a square lattice reproduce all known features from state-of-the-art simulations also with only a few mixed momenta. Consequently, we believe the MMHK model offers an alternative tool for strongly correlated quantum matter.

Title: Higher condensation theory
Authors: Liang Kong, Zhi-Hao Zhang, Jiaheng Zhao, Hao Zheng
Abstract: We develop a unified mathematical theory of defect condensations for topological orders in all dimensions based on higher categories, higher algebras and higher representations. A k-codimensional topological defect $A$ in an n+1D (potentially anomalous) topological order $C^{n+1}$ is condensable if it is equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_k$-algebra. Condensing such a defect $A$ amounts to a k-step process. In the first step, we condense the defect $A$ along one of its transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-1)-codimensional defect $\Sigma A$, which is naturally equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_{k-1}$-algebra. In the second step, we condense the defect $\Sigma A$ in one of the remaining transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-2)-codimensional defect $\Sigma^2 A$, so on and so forth. In the k-th step, we condense the 1-codimensional defect $\Sigma^{k-1}A$ along the only transversal direction, thus defining a phase transition from $C^{n+1}$ to a new n+1D topological order $D^{n+1}$. We give precise mathematical descriptions of each step in above process, including the precise mathematical characterization of the condensed phase $D^{n+1}$. When $C^{n+1}$ is anomaly-free, the same phase transition can be alternatively defined by replacing the last two steps by a single step of condensing the $E_2$-algebra $\Sigma^{k-2}A$ directly along the remaining two transversal directions. When n=2, this modified last step is precisely a usual anyon condensation in a 2+1D topological order. We derive many new mathematical results physically along the way. We also establish the connections among various notions of "gauging" symmetries. We also briefly discuss questions, generalizations and applications that naturally arise from our theory, including higher Morita theory, a theory of integrals and the condensations of liquid-like gapless defects in topological orders.

Title: Dirac Fermions and Topological Phases in Magnetic Topological Insulator Films
Authors: Kai-Zhi Bai, Bo Fu, Shun-Qing Shen
Abstract: We develop a Dirac fermion theory for topological phases in magnetic topological insulator films. The theory is based on exact solutions of the energies and the wave functions for an effective model of the three-dimensional topological insulator (TI) film. It is found that the TI film consists of a pair of massless or massive Dirac fermions for the surface states, and a series of massive Dirac fermions for the bulk states. The massive Dirac fermion always carries zero or integer quantum Hall conductance when the valence band is fully occupied while the massless Dirac fermion carries a one-half quantum Hall conductance when the chemical potential is located around the Dirac point for a finite range. The magnetic exchange interaction in the magnetic layers in the film can be used to manipulate either the masses or chirality of the Dirac fermions and gives rise to distinct topological phases, which cover the known topological insulating phases, such as quantum anomalous Hall effect, quantum spin Hall effect and axion effect, and also the novel topological metallic phases, such as half quantized Hall effect, half quantum mirror Hall effect, and metallic quantum anomalous Hall effect.

Title: The persistence of spin coherence in a crystalline environment
Authors: Gerald Curran III, Zachary Rex, Casper X. Wilson, Luke J. Weaver, Ivan Biaggio
Abstract: We analyze quantum interference in the triplet-exciton pair generated by singlet exciton fission in a molecular crystal, and introduce transport-induced dephasing (TID) as a key effect that can suppress the expected fluorescence quantum beats when the triplet-exciton wavefunction can localize on inequivalent sites. TID depends on the triplet-exciton hopping rate between inequivalent sites and on the energy-shifts among the stationary states of the entangled triplet pair in different spatial configurations. The theoretical model is confirmed by experiments in rubrene single crystals, where triplet pairs remain entangled for more than 50 ns but quantum beats are suppressed by TID within a few nanoseconds when the magnetic field is misaligned by just a few degrees from specific symmetric directions. Our experiments deliver the zero-field parameters for the rubrene molecule in its orthorhombic lattice and information on triplet-exciton transport, in particular the triplet-exciton hopping rate between inequivalent sites, which we evaluate to be of the order of 150 ps in rubrene.

Title: A defect-chemistry-informed phase-field model of grain growth in oxide ceramics: application to Fe-doped SrTiO3
Authors: Kai Wang, Roger A. De Souza, Xiang-Long Peng, Rotraut Merkle, Wolfgang Rheinheimer, Karsten Albe, Bai-Xiang Xu
Abstract: Dopants can significantly affect the properties of oxide ceramics through their impact on the property-determined microstructure characteristics such as grain boundary (GB) segregation, space charge layer formation in the GB vicinity, and the grain growth deviating from normal patterns. To support the rational design of oxide ceramics, we propose a defect-chemistry-informed phase-field grain growth model to simulate the microstructure evolution of oxide ceramics. It fully respects the defect-chemistry theory by accounting for the distinct segregation energies and available site densities of charged point defects (oxygen vacancies and acceptor dopants) in both the grain interior and boundaries, and it considers the competing kinetics of defect diffusion and GB movement. The proposed phase-field model is benchmarked against well-known bicrystal models, including the Mott-Schottky and Gouy-Chapman models. Various simulation results are presented to reveal the effect of different defect-chemistry parameters on the space charge layer formation and key microstructural aspects. In particular, simulation results confirm that the solute drag effect alone can lead to skewed grain size distribution that do not follow the log-normal distribution, without any contribution from grain misorientation and other anisotropy. Interestingly, simulations also demonstrate that grain boundary potentials can vary substantially: GBs of larger grains tend to have lower potentials than those of smaller grains. Such heterogeneous GB potential distribution may inspire a new material optimization strategy through microstructure design. This study provides a comprehensive framework for defect-chemistry-consistent investigations of microstructure evolution in polycrystalline oxide ceramics, offering fundamental insights into microscopic processes during critical manufacturing stages.

Title: Flat-band Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov State from Quantum Geometric Discrepancy
Authors: Zi-Ting Sun, Ruo-Peng Yu, Shuai A. Chen, Jin-Xin Hu, K. T. Law
Abstract: We propose a new scheme for realizing Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) Cooper pairing states within flat bands, in contrast to the conventional paradigm such as the Zeeman effect. Central to our scheme is the concept of ``quantum geometric discrepancy'' (QGD) that measures differences in the quantum geometry of paired electrons and drives the flat-band FFLO instability. Remarkably, we find that this instability is directly related to a quantum geometric quantity known as ``anomalous quantum distance'', which formally captures QGD. To model both QGD and the anomalous quantum distance, we examine a flat-band electronic Hamiltonian with tunable spin-dependent quantum metrics. Utilizing the band-projection method, we analyze the QGD-induced FFLO instability from pairing susceptibility. Furthermore, we perform mean-field numerical simulations to obtain the phase diagram of the BCS-FFLO transition, which aligns well with our analytical results. Our work demonstrates that QGD offers a general and distinctive mechanism for stabilizing the flat-band FFLO phase.

Title: Excited States Band Mapping and Ultrafast Nonequilibrium Dynamics in Topological Dirac Semimetal 1T-ZrTe$_2$
Authors: Sotirios Fragkos, Evgenia Symeonidou, Emile Lasserre, Baptiste Fabre, Dominique Descamps, Stéphane Petit, Polychronis Tsipas, Yann Mairesse, Athanasios Dimoulas, Samuel Beaulieu
Abstract: We performed time- and polarization-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy on topological Dirac semimetal candidate 1T-ZrTe$_2$. Excited states band mapping uncovers the previously inaccessible linear dispersion of the Dirac cone above the Fermi level. We study the orbital texture of bands using linear dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions. These observations provide hints on the topological character of 1T-ZrTe$_2$. Time-, energy- and momentum-resolved nonequilibrium carrier dynamics reveal that intra- and inter-band scattering processes play a capital role in the relaxation mechanism, leading to multivalley electron-hole accumulation near the Fermi level. We also show that electrons' inverse lifetime has a linear dependence on their binding energy. Our time- and polarization-resolved XUV photoemission results shed light on the excited state electronic structure of 1T-ZrTe$_2$ and provide valuable insights into the relatively unexplored field of quantum-state-resolved ultrafast dynamics in 3D topological Dirac semimetals.

Title: Spectral decomposition and high-accuracy Greens functions: Overcoming the Nyquist-Shannon limit via complex-time Krylov expansion
Authors: Sebastian Paeckel
Abstract: The accurate computation of low-energy spectra of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, typically accessed via Greens-functions, is a long-standing problem posing enormous challenges to numerical methods. When the spectral decomposition is obtained from Fourier transforming a time series, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem limits the frequency resolution $\Delta\omega$ according to the numerically accessible time domain size $T$ via $\Delta\omega = 2/T$. In tensor network methods, increasing the domain size is exponentially hard due to the ubiquitous spread of correlations, limiting the frequency resolution and thereby restricting this ansatz class mostly to one-dimensional systems with small quasi-particle velocities. Here, we show how this fundamental limitation can be overcome using complex-time Krylov spaces. At the example of the critical $S-1/2$ Heisenberg model and light bipolarons in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate the enormous improvements in accuracy, which can be achieved using this method.

Title: Eigenstate thermalization to non-monotonic distributions in strongly-interacting chaotic lattice gases
Authors: Vladimir A. Yurovsky (School of Chemistry, Tel Aviv University), Amichay Vardi (Department of Chemistry, Ben-Gurion University and ITAMP, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)
Abstract: We find non-monotonic equilibrium energy distributions, qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein forms, in strongly-interacting many-body chaotic systems. The effect emerges in systems with finite energy spectra, supporting both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum ergodicity. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.

Title: Improving accuracy of tree-tensor network approach by optimization of network structure
Authors: Toshiya Hikihara, Hiroshi Ueda, Kouichi Okunishi, Kenji Harada, Tomotoshi Nishino
Abstract: Numerical methods based on tensor networks have been extensively explored in the research of quantum many-body systems in recent years. It has been recognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body state crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the previous work [Hikihara et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013031 (2023)], we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs) that automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial profile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the random XY-exchange model under random magnetic fields and the Richardson model in order to analyze how the performance of the algorithm depends on the detailed updating schemes of the structural optimization. We then find that for the random XY model, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the stochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure probabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other hand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and the updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic updating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the stochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing the network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results indicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical calculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to appropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure, depending on the systems treated.

Title: Quantitative study on anomalous Nernst effect in Co thin films by laser irradiation
Authors: Soichiro Mochizuki, Itaru Sugiura, Tetsuya Narushima, Teruo Ono, Takuya Satoh, Kihiro T. Yamada
Abstract: The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) generates electromotive forces transverse to temperature gradients and has attracted much attention for potential applications into novel thermoelectric power generators. ANE efficiency is generally characterized by uniform temperature gradients in a steady state prepared by heaters. However, although focusing laser beams on a magnetic film can form much larger temperature gradients, the laser irradiation method has not been sufficiently considered for quantifying the ANE coefficient due to the difficulty in estimating the localized in-homogeneous temperature gradients. In this study, we present a quantitative study of ANE in Ru(5 nm)/Co($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$) ($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$ = 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, and 60 nm) bilayers on sapphire (0001) substrates by combining a laser irradiation approach with finite element analysis of temperature gradients under laser excitation. We find that the estimated ANE coefficients are consistent with previously reported values and one independently characterized using a heater. Our results also reveal the advantages of the laser irradiation method over the conventional method using heaters. Intensity-modulated laser beams can create ac temperature gradients as large as approximately 10$^3$ K/mm at a frequency of tens of kilohertz in a micrometer-scale region.

Title: Quantifying the amplitudes of ultrafast magnetization fluctuations in Sm$_{0.7}$Er$_{0.3}$FeO$_{3}$ using femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy
Authors: M. A. Weiss, F. S. Herbst, G. Skobjin, S. Eggert, M. Nakajima, D. Reustlen, A. Leitenstorfer, S. T. B. Goennenwein, T. Kurihara
Abstract: Spin fluctuations are an important issue for the design and operation of future spintronic devices. Femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy (FemNoC) was recently applied to detect ultrafast magnetization fluctuations. FemNoC gives direct access to the spontaneous fluctuations of the magnetization in magnetically ordered materials. In FemNoC experiments, the magnetic fluctuations are imprinted on the polarization state of two independent femtosecond probe pulses upon transmission through a magnetic sample. Using a subharmonic demodulation scheme, the cross-correlation of the signals from both pulse trains is calculated. Here, we quantitatively link the FemNoC output signal to an optical polarization rotation, and then in turn to the magnitude of the inherent spin fluctuations. To this end, three different calibration protocols are presented and compared in accuracy. Ultimately, we quantitatively determine both the variance of optical polarization noise in rad$^2$, and that of the ultrafast magnetization fluctuations in (A/m)$^2$.

Title: Investigation of Softer Lattice Dynamics in Defect Engineered GeTe Crystals
Authors: Saptak Majumder, Pintu Singha, Sharath Kumar C., Mayanak K. Gupta, Dharmendra Kumar, R. Mittal, D. K. Shukla, M.P Saravanan, Deepshikha Jaiswal-Nagar, Vinayak B. Kamble
Abstract: The impact of Ge vacancies on the low-temperature lattice dynamics of single-crystalline GeTe was investigated through a comparative study of two off-stoichiometric samples: Ge$_{0.8}$Te (S$_1$) and Ge$_{0.88}$Te (S$_2$). X-ray diffraction confirms their highly oriented crystalline nature mainly along the $h0l$ plane, while temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy reveals pronounced anharmonicity in S$_1$, indicated by stronger three-phonon scattering in the in-plane E-mode. A suppressed Raman feature at $~$ 239 $cm^{-1}$ in S$_2$ suggests fewer disordered GeTe$_{4-n}$Ge$_n$ tetrahedra, correlating with reduced Ge-Ge bonding signatures. Machine-Learned Molecular Dynamics (MLMD) simulations show dominant Te contributions below 100 $cm^{-1}$, while Ge dominates above, particularly influencing the 120 $cm^{-1}$ mode affected by defects at the Ge-site. Complementary calculation of phonon linewidth via MLMD and Temperature-Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP) methods affirm the predominance of three-phonon scattering below 300 K. Specific heat measurements, modeled using Debye-Einstein formalism, show lower Debye temperatures ($\theta_D$) of 172.3 $\pm$ 1.5 K in Ge$_{0.8}$Te and 176.6 $\pm$ 1.7 K for Ge$_{0.88}$Te respectively, confirming defect-induced lattice softening. Electrical resistivity analysis further corroborates this, indicating reduced effective phonon frequencies in $S_1$. Thus, our results establish that higher Ge vacancies lead to softer, and hence more anharmonic lattice dynamics in GeTe, with its relevance in designing superior thermoelectric and phase-change memory applications.

Title: Walks in Rotation Spaces Return Home when Doubled and Scaled
Authors: Jean-Pierre Eckmann, Tsvi Tlusty
Abstract: The dynamics of numerous physical systems, such as spins and qubits, can be described as a series of rotation operations, i.e., walks in the manifold of the rotation group. A basic question with practical applications is how likely and under what conditions such walks return to the origin (the identity rotation), which means that the physical system returns to its initial state. In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3) or SU(2), even a very complicated one, will preferentially return to the origin simply by traversing the walk twice in a row and uniformly scaling all rotation angles. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return, and comment on the problem in higher dimensions.

Title: Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect
Authors: Kamran Behnia
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. The experimentally-measured thermal Hall angle in various insulators does not exceed a bound and becomes maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. The present paper aims to propose a scenario providing and explanation for these two experimental facts. It begins by noticing that at this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions become most frequent in comparison with Umklapp and boundary scattering events. Furthermore, the Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase in the presence of a magnetic field. In an anharmonic crystal, in which tensile and compressive strain do not cancel out, this field-induced atomic phase gives rise to a phonon Berry phase and generates phonon-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the phonon wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest atomic displacement, $\delta u_m$ at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.

Title: Scaling laws of shrinkage induced fragmentation phenomena
Authors: Roland Szatmári, Akio Nakahara, So Kitsunezaki, Ferenc Kun
Abstract: We investigate the shrinkage induced breakup of thin layers of heterogeneous materials attached to a substrate, a ubiquitous natural phenomenon with a wide range of potential applications. Focusing on the evolution of the fragment ensemble, we demonstrate that the system has two distinct phases: damage phase, where the layer is cracked, however, a dominant piece persists retaining the structural integrity of the layer, and a fragmentation phase, where the layer disintegrates into numerous small pieces. Based on finite size scaling we show that the transition between the two phases occurs at a critical damage analogous to continuous phase transitions. At the critical point a fully connected crack network emerges whose structure is controlled by the strength of adhesion to the substrate. In the strong adhesion limit, damage arises from random microcrack nucleation, resembling bond percolation, while weak adhesion facilitates stress concentration and the growth of cracks to large extensions. The critical exponents of the damage to fragmentation transition agree to a reasonable accuracy with those of two-dimensional bond percolation. Our findings provide a novel insight into the mechanism of shrinkage-induced cracking revealing generic scaling laws of the phenomenon.

Title: Orthogonal lattice distortions inside crystalline Si upon sub-threshold femtosecond laser-induced excitation

Abstract: Material processing with femtosecond lasers has attracted enormous attention because of its potential for technology and industrial applications. In parallel, time-resolved x-ray diffraction has been successfully used to study ultrafast structural distortion dynamics in semiconductor thin films or surface layers. However, real-world processing applications mostly are concerned with bulk materials, which prevents the use of x-ray surface based techniques. For processing applications, a fast and depth-sensitive probe is needed. To address this, we present a novel technique based on ultrafast x-ray dynamical diffraction (UDD) capable of imaging transient strain distributions inside bulk crystals upon laser excitation. This pump-probe technique provides a complete picture of thetemporal evolution of ultrafast distorted lattice depth profiles. We demonstrate the potential of UDD by studying a thin Si single crystal upon single pulse femtosecond optical excitation. Our study reveals that below the melting threshold strong lattice distortions not only longitudinal, but also transversal to the propagation of the strain wave appear on picosecond time scales along the single crystal. The observation of this transversal deformation after laser excitation contradicts previous work that were not able to observed it, what could be related to the high sensitivity of dynamical diffraction with respect to the lattice distortions. The speed of propagation of this ultrafast transversal strain deformation is observed to be slower to the longitudinal sound speed for Si as described in the bibliography.

Title: A controlled expansion for pairing in a polarized band with strong repulsion
Authors: Zhiyu Dong, Patrick A. Lee
Abstract: Can strong repulsive interactions be shown to give rise to pairing in a controlled way? We find that for a single flavor polarized band, there is a small expansion parameter in the low density limit, once the Bloch wavefunction form factor is taken into account. A perturbative expansion is possible, even if the interaction is much stronger than the Fermi energy $\epsilon_F$. As a matter of principle, our work shows analytically how strong pairing can emerge from strong repulsion. We illustrate our method with two examples: a 2D Dirac model and a 1D tight binding model with two orbitals. In the latter case, using density matrix renormalization group, we show that the analytical theory indeed guided us to discover the parameter regime where p-wave pairing with order-1 strength is dominant.

Title: Error bounds on the universal Lindblad equation in the thermodynamic limit
Authors: Teruhiro Ikeuchi, Takashi Mori
Abstract: It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has the desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors from several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation remain small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Fluctuations of local plastic strain in granular media
Authors: I. Awada, M. Bornert, V. Langlois, J. Léopoldès
Abstract: We experimentally study the heterogeneity of strain in a granular medium subjected to oscillatory shear in a rotating drum. Two complementary methods are used. The first method relies on optical imaging and grain tracking, allowing us to compute some components of the strain tensor and their variance. The second method, Diffusive Acoustic Wave Spectroscopy (DAWS), provides the quadratic strain within the bulk. Our results show that strain is spatially heterogeneous, with fluctuations about ten times larger than the mean, primarily dominated by variability at the grain scale. We then analyze in detail the strain fluctuations occurring during the forward and backward branches of the shear stress cycles, along with the intra-cycle plastic strain resulting from of each cycle. Both methods reveal that each shear cycle consists of two consecutive diffusive-like branches, and that the resulting plastic strain fluctuations scales with the mean plastic shear strain. We propose that plastic strain fluctuations result from irreversible strain heterogeneity that increases with applied shear -- reflected in forward--backward strain anticorrelations -- but is constrained by load-controlled induced memory.

Title: Machine Learning - Driven Materials Discovery: Unlocking Next-Generation Functional Materials - A review
Authors: Dilshod Nematov, Mirabbos Hojamberdiev
Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven techniques is revolutionizing materials discovery, property prediction, and material design by minimizing human intervention and accelerating scientific progress. This review provides a comprehensive overview of smart, machine learning (ML)-driven approaches, emphasizing their role in predicting material properties, discovering novel compounds, and optimizing material structures. Key methodologies in this field include deep learning, graph neural networks, Bayesian optimization, and automated generative models (GANs, VAEs). These approaches enable the autonomous design of materials with tailored functionalities. By leveraging AutoML frameworks (AutoGluon, TPOT, and this http URL), researchers can automate the model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, significantly improving the efficiency of materials informatics. Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven robotic laboratories and high-throughput computing has established a fully automated pipeline for rapid synthesis and experimental validation, drastically reducing the time and cost of material discovery. This review highlights real-world applications of automated ML-driven approaches in predicting mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of materials, demonstrating successful cases in superconductors, catalysts, photovoltaics, and energy storage systems. We also address key challenges, such as data quality, interpretability, and the integration of AutoML with quantum computing, which are essential for future advancements. Ultimately, combining AI with automated experimentation and computational modeling is transforming the way materials are discovered and optimized. This synergy paves the way for new innovations in energy, electronics, and nanotechnology.

Title: Symmetry resolved out-of-time-order correlators of Heisenberg spin chains using projected matrix product operators
Authors: Martina Gisti, David J. Luitz, Maxime Debertolis
Abstract: We extend the concept of operator charge in the context of an abelian U (1) symmetry and apply this framework to symmetry-preserving matrix product operators (MPOs), enabling the description of operators projected onto specific sectors of the corresponding symmetry. Leveraging this representation, we study the effect of interactions on the scrambling of information in an integrable Heisenberg spin chain, by controlling the number of particles. Our focus lies on out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) which we project on sectors with a fixed number of particles. This allows us to link the non-interacting system to the fully-interacting one by allowing more and more particle to interact with each other, keeping the interaction parameter fixed. While at short times, the OTOCs are almost not affected by interactions, the spreading of the information front becomes gradually faster and the OTOC saturate at larger values as the number of particle increases. We also study the behavior of finite-size systems by considering the OTOCs at times beyond the point where the front hits the boundary of the system. We find that in every sector with more than one particle, the OTOCs behave as if the local operator was rotated by a random unitary matrix, indicating that the presence of boundaries contributes to the maximal scrambling of local operators.

Title: A mean-field theory for heterogeneous random growth with redistribution
Authors: Maximilien Bernard, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Pierre Le Doussal
Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.

Title: Fate of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Paired Phase in Coupled $XY$ Models
Authors: Tianning Xiao, Youjin Deng, Xiao-Yu Dong
Abstract: Intriguing phases may emerge when two-dimensional systems are coupled in a bilayer configuration. In particular, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) paired superfluid phase was predicted and claimed to be numerically observed in a coupled $XY$ model with ferromagnetic interlayer interactions, as reported in [\href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 100601 (2019)}]. However, both our Monte Carlo simulations and analytical analysis show that this model does not exhibit a BKT paired phase. We then propose a new model incorporating paired-phase gradient interlayer interactions to realize the BKT paired phase. Moreover, we observe that the anomalous magnetic dimension varies along the phase transition line between the disordered normal phase and the BKT paired phase. This finding requires an understanding beyond the conventional phase transition theory.

Title: Ideal quantum geometry of the surface states of rhombohedral graphite and its effects on the surface superconductivity
Authors: Guodong Jiang, Tero Heikkilä, Päivi Törmä
Abstract: The interplay of quantum geometry and interactions determines the correlated state properties of flat bands. Here, we investigate the ideal quantum geometry (IQG), i.e., the property that the trace of quantum metric equals the Berry curvature, in the surface flat bands of rhombohedrally stacked graphene (RG) multilayers. We show that RG represents a class of semimetals with IQG, among which only RG has a nonvanishing IQG at the center of the surface bands. In the presence of long-range hoppings, a displacement field polarizes the electron density to one of the two surfaces, stabilizing the IQG and boosting transitions to correlated phases like superconductivity. Analyzing the superfluid stiffness of the superconducting state in a many-layer RG, we reveal a heavy-fermion picture where the "heavy electrons" carry a nonzero supercurrent. This unusual behavior arises from the IQG of the surface states, which suggests a large fraction of supercurrent running on the surface of RG.

Title: Exact large-scale correlations in diffusive systems with general interactions: explicit characterisation without the Dean--Kawasaki equation
Authors: Aurélien Grabsch, Davide Venturelli, Olivier Bénichou
Abstract: Characterising the statistical properties of classical interacting particle systems is a long-standing question. For Brownian particles the microscopic density obeys a stochastic evolution equation, known as the Dean--Kawasaki equation. This equation remains mostly formal and linearization (or higher-order expansions) is required to obtain explicit expressions for physical observables, with a range of validity not easily defined. Here, by combining macroscopic fluctuation theory with equilibrium statistical mechanics, we provide a systematic alternative to the Dean--Kawasaki framework to characterize large-scale correlations. This approach enables us to obtain explicit and exact results for dynamical observables such as tracer cumulants and bath-tracer correlations in one dimension, both in and out of equilibrium. In particular, we reveal a generic non-monotonic spatial structure in the response of the bath following a temperature quench. Our approach applies to a broad class of interaction potentials and extends naturally to higher dimensions.

Title: Ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory of correlations in hard rod gas
Authors: Anupam Kundu
Abstract: Recently, a theoretical framework known as {\it ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory} has been developed to study large-scale fluctuations and correlations in many-body systems exhibiting ballistic transport. In this paper, we review this theory in the context of a one-dimensional gas of hard rods. The initial configurations of the rods are sampled from a probability distribution characterised by slowly varying conserved density profiles across this http URL from a microscopic description, we first formulate the macroscopic fluctuation theory in terms of the phase-space density of quasiparticles. In the second part, we apply this framework to compute the two-point, two-time correlation functions of the conserved densities in the Euler scaling limit. We derive an explicit expression for the correlation function which not only reveals its inherent symmetries, but is also straightforward to evaluate numerically for a given initial state. Our results also recover known expressions for space-time correlations in equilibrium for the hard-rod gas.

Title: Evaporative Refrigeration Effect in Evaporation and Condensation between Two Parallel Plates
Authors: Peiyi Chen, Qin Li, Gang Chen
Abstract: It is well-known that evaporation can lead to cooling. However, little is known that evaporation can actually create a refrigeration effect, i.e., the vapor phase temperature can drop below the temperature of the cooling wall. This possibility was recently pointed out via modeling based on an approximate quasi-continuum approach. This work examines this effect rigorously by studying evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates by coupling the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation in the vapor phase with the continuum treatments in both liquid films. Numerical results show that the vapor phase temperature at the evaporating side can be much lower than the coldest wall temperature at the condensing surface, reaffirming the evaporative refrigeration effect. The present work further reveals that this effect is caused by two mechanisms. While the dominant mechanism is the asymmetry in the molecular distribution between the outgoing and the incoming molecules at the interface, additional cooling occurs within the Knudsen layer due to the sudden expansion, similar to the Joule-Thomson effect, although with subtle differences in that the interfacial expansion is not an isenthalpic process. The impacts of key parameters, including liquid thickness, Knudsen number, and accommodation coefficient, are investigated. The numerical simulation shows that with a thicker vapor, a thinner liquid film, and a larger accommodation coefficient, leads to stronger evaporative refrigeration effect. This work will motivate future experiments to further confirm this prediction and explore its potential applications in air-conditioning, refrigeration, and membrane distillation.

Title: Evolution of density variations in a trapped atomic superfluid driven into turbulence
Authors: Michelle A. Moreno-Armijos, Leandro Machado, Arnol D. García-Orozco, Sarah Sab, Amilson R. Fritsch, Vanderlei S. Bagnato
Abstract: In this work, we study the free decay of a turbulent trapped Bose gas by analyzing the temporal evolution of density variations extracted from absorption images. We introduce a parameter $\delta$ as a simple and experimentally accessible observable that captures the amplitude of density variations. After the driving is turned off, this parameter exhibits a clear decay, which enabled us to identify a characteristic relaxation time. Interestingly, this timescale remains nearly constant across the range of excitation amplitudes explored, while the magnitude of $\delta$ varies with the injected energy. Numerical simulations based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveal a qualitatively similar behavior, both showing a decay of density variations over time.

Title: Machine Learning Tool to Analyse Spectroscopic Changes in High-Dimensional Data
Authors: Alberto Martinez-Serra, Gionni Marchetti, Francesco D'Amico, Ivana Fenoglio, Barbara Rossi, Marco P. Monopoli, Giancarlo Franzese
Abstract: When nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into a biological solution, layers of biomolecules form on their surface, creating a corona. Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology. However, the influence of NP properties on protein conformation is not well understood. In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen, a crucial protein in human blood plasma, at physiological concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method offers a quantitative analysis of protein structural changes upon adsorption and enhances the understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.

Title: An adaptive, data-driven multiscale approach for dense granular flows
Authors: B. Siddani, Weiqun Zhang, Andrew Nonaka, John Bell, Ishan Srivastava
Abstract: The accuracy of coarse-grained continuum models of dense granular flows is limited by the lack of high-fidelity closure models for granular rheology. One approach to addressing this issue, referred to as the hierarchical multiscale method, is to use a high-fidelity fine-grained model to compute the closure terms needed by the coarse-grained model. The difficulty with this approach is that the overall model can become computationally intractable due to the high computational cost of the high-fidelity model. In this work, we describe a multiscale modeling approach for dense granular flows that utilizes neural networks trained using high-fidelity discrete element method (DEM) simulations to approximate the constitutive granular rheology for a continuum incompressible flow model. Our approach leverages an ensemble of neural networks to estimate predictive uncertainty that allows us to determine whether the rheology at a given point is accurately represented by the neural network model. Additional DEM simulations are only performed when needed, minimizing the number of additional DEM simulations required when updating the rheology. This adaptive coupling significantly reduces the overall computational cost of the approach while controlling the error. In addition, the neural networks are customized to learn regularized rheological behavior to ensure well-posedness of the continuum solution. We first validate the approach using two-dimensional steady-state and decelerating inclined flows. We then demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by modeling three-dimensional sub-aerial granular column collapse for varying initial column aspect ratios, where our multiscale method compares well with the computationally expensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-DEM simulation.

Title: Phonon, Infrared and Raman Spectra of LiGa5O8 from Density Functional Perturbation Theory
Authors: Sarker Md. Sadman, Walter R. L. Lambrecht
Abstract: LiGa$_5$O$_8$ with a cubic spinel type structure was recently reported to be a ultra-wide-band-gap semiconductor with unintentional p-type conduction. While the origin of p-type doping is still unclear, the fundamental properties of this material are of interest. Here we present a first-principles study of the phonons using density functional perturbation theory. The phonon band structures show no unstable modes verifying the stability of the structure. We focus mainly on the phonons at the Brillouin zone center for which a full symmetry analysis is presented. We present the dielectric function contributions from the infrared active modes as well as the Raman spectra and their polarization dependence. The phonon density of states integrated over the Brillouin zone is also presented as this may related to disordered Raman spectra.

Title: Efficient production of sodium Bose-Einstein condensates in a hybrid trap
Authors: Yanda Geng, Shouvik Mukherjee, Swarnav Banik, Monica Gutierrez Galan, Madison J. Anderson, Hector Sosa-Martinez, Stephen P. Eckel, Ian B. Spielman, Gretchen K. Campbell
Abstract: We describe an apparatus that efficiently produces $^{23}$Na Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a hybrid trap that combines a quadrupole magnetic field with a far-detuned optical dipole trap. Using a Bayesian optimization framework, we systematically optimize all BEC production parameters in modest sized batches of highly correlated parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier-based technique to optimize the duration of different evaporation stages constrained to have a fixed total duration; this enables the progressive creation of increasingly rapid experimental sequences that still generate high quality BECs. Taken together, our techniques constitute a general approach for refining and accelerating sequence-based experimental protocols.

Title: Cubic BeB$_2$: A metastable $p$-type conductive material from first principles
Authors: Xiao Zhang, Shashi Mishra, Elena R. Margine, Emmanouil Kioupakis
Abstract: Boron forms a wide variety of compounds with alkaline earth elements due to its unique bonding characteristics. Among these, binary compounds of Be and B display particularly rich structural diversity, attributed to the small atomic size of Be. Cubic BeB$_2$ is a particularly interesting phase, where Be donates electrons to stabilize a diamond-like boron network under high pressure. In this work, we employ \textit{ab initio} methods to conduct a detailed investigation of cubic BeB$_2$ and its functional properties. We show that this metastable phase is dynamically stable under ambient conditions, and its lattice match to existing substrate materials suggests possible epitaxial stabilization via thin-film growth routes. Through a comprehensive characterization of its electronic, transport, and superconductivity properties, we demonstrate that cubic BeB$_2$ exhibits high hole concentrations and high hole mobility, making it a potential candidate for efficient $p$-type transport. In addition, cubic BeB$_2$ is found to exhibit low-temperature superconductivity at degenerate doping levels, similar to several other doped covalent semiconductors such as diamond, Si, and SiC.

Title: Scanning gate microscopy probing of anisotropic electron flow in a two dimensional electron gas at the (110) $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ interface: A theoretical investigation
Authors: M. P. Nowak, M. Zegrodnik, D. Grzelec, B. Szafran, R. Citro, P. Wójcik
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the anisotropic dispersion features of a two dimensional electron gas at the (110) oriented $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ interfaces, as revealed by scanning gate microscopy of electronic flow from a quantum point contact. The dispersion relation of the (110) $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ interface is characterized by a highly non-circular Fermi surface. Here, we develop an efficient tight-binding model for the electron gas at the interface. We show that the anisotropy of the Fermi surface causes both the direction of the electron flux from the quantum point contact and the periodicity of the self-interference conductance fringes to depend strongly on the orientation of the constriction relative to the crystal lattice. We show that the radially non-uniform distribution of the Fermi velocity on the Fermi surface results in skewing of electron trajectories when the quantum point contact gates are not aligned with the in-plane primitive vectors. We show that this effect results in the separation of electrons belonging to different orbitals for wide (110) $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ quantum wells.

Title: Role of interaction anisotropy in polymer cononsolvency: insights from the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework
Authors: Satyen Dhamankar, Michael A. Webb
Abstract: Cononsolvency occurs when mixing two good solvents creates poor-solvent conditions for polymers over specific composition ranges, causing macroscopic phase separation or microscopic chain collapse. Despite its technological and biophysical relevance, the connection between macroscopic and microscopic manifestations of cononsolvency remains unclear. A key challenge is identifying which interactions govern cononsolvency: coarse-grained analyses like standard Flory--Huggins models assume purely isotropic interactions, while atomistic simulations contain complex anisotropic interactions that cannot be precisely controlled or isolated. Here, we address the role of interaction anisotropy using the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework, which yields $\chi$ as a thermodynamic average over both configurational and internal-state coarse-grained degrees of freedom. This enables controlled comparison between systems with isotropic versus orientation-dependent interactions that share identical effective $\chi$ parameters, either driving cononsolvency by strong solvent-cosolvent affinity or preferential polymer-cosolvent affinity. While pairs of systems exhibit equivalent macroscopic phase behavior, lattice Monte Carlo simulations reveal that those featuring orientation-dependent interactions generate distinct collapse signatures, particularly in reentrant coil-globule transitions or characteristics of the solvation structure. These results demonstrate how microscopic interactions influences cononsolvency behavior beyond what effective $\chi$ parameters alone predict.

Title: FeTaX2: A ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulator
Authors: Yadong Jiang, Huan Wang, Jing Wang
Abstract: We propose that the van der Waals layered ternary transition metal chalcogenides FeTa$X_2$ ($X=$ S, Se, Te) as a new family of ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulators with a sizable bulk gap and high Chern number $C=-2$. The magnetic order arises primarily from Fe atoms, whose strong ferromagnetic exchange induces moments on neighboring Ta sites. The large topological gap originates from a \emph{deep} $s$-$d$-type band inversion between spin-down Ta $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{xy}$ orbitals near the Fermi level-a mechanism unique to $d$-orbital systems. Remarkably, the Curie temperature of monolayer FeTa$X_2$ is predicted to significantly exceed that of monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Furthermore, both the Curie temperature and topological gap scale positively with the spin-orbit coupling strength of the $d$ electrons, suggesting a common physical origin. Owing to its structural similarity to Fe$X$ superconductors and reduced net magnetization, FeTa$X_2$ further offers a promising platform for realizing chiral topological superconductivity. These findings, if realized experimentally, could open new avenues for the research and application of topological quantum physics.

Title: Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part I: equilibrium multifarious self-assembly
Authors: Jakob Metson, Saeed Osat, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: Multifarious assembly models consider multiple structures assembled from a shared set of components, reflecting the efficient usage of components in biological self-assembly. These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. In contrast, discrete-time simulations are slow to show this instability, particularly for large system sizes. For the remaining state space we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space, and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.

Title: Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part II: non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization
Authors: Jakob Metson, Saeed Osat, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: In the context of self-assembly, where complex structures can be assembled from smaller units, it is desirable to devise strategies towards disassembly and reassembly processes that reuse the constituent parts. A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced, and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations, and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.

Title: Accelerating Resonant Spectroscopy Simulations Using Multi-Shifted Bi-Conjugate Gradient
Authors: Prakash Sharma, Luogen Xu, Fei Xue, Yao Wang
Abstract: Resonant spectroscopies, which involve intermediate states with finite lifetimes, provide essential insights into collective excitations in quantum materials that are otherwise inaccessible. However, theoretical understanding in this area is often limited by the numerical challenges of solving Kramers-Heisenberg-type response functions for large-scale systems. To address this, we introduce a multi-shifted biconjugate gradient algorithm that exploits the shared structure of Krylov subspaces across spectra with varying incident energies, effectively reducing the computational complexity to that of linear spectroscopies. Both mathematical proofs and numerical benchmarks confirm that this algorithm substantially accelerates spectral simulations, achieving constant complexity independent of the number of incident energies, while ensuring accuracy and stability. This development provides a scalable, versatile framework for simulating advanced spectroscopies in quantum materials.

Title: Infinite randomness criticality and localization of the floating phase in arrays of Rydberg atoms trapped with non-perfect tweezers
Authors: Jose Soto-Garcia, Natalia Chepiga
Abstract: Chains of Rydberg atoms have emerged as a powerful platform for exploring low-dimensional quantum physics. This success originates from the precise control of lattice geometries provided by optical tweezers, which allows access to a wide range of synthetic quantum phases. Experiments on one-dimensional arrays have stimulated tremendous progress in understanding quantum phase transitions into crystalline phases. However, the finite width of tweezers introduces small variations in interatomic distances, leading to quenched disorder in the interactions. In this letter, we numerically study how such disorder alters the nature of two critical regimes observed in experiments. Firstly, following experimental protocols, we analyze Kibble-Zurek dynamics and find a crossover from the clean Ising transition to the infinite-randomness fixed point as system size and disorder strength increase. Secondly, we show that the floating phase (an incommensurate Luttinger liquid phase emerging at stronger interactions) is localized by the disorder, yet preserves short-range incommensurate correlations with the same leading wave vector. Our results clearly reveal an additional technical challenge in the scalability of Rydberg-based quantum simulators.

Title: Fundamentals and advances in transverse thermoelectrics
Authors: Hiroto Adachi, Fuyuki Ando, Takamasa Hirai, Rajkumar Modak, Matthew A. Grayson, Ken-ichi Uchida
Abstract: Transverse thermoelectric effects interconvert charge and heat currents in orthogonal directions due to the breaking of either time-reversal symmetry or structural symmetry, enabling simple and versatile thermal energy harvesting and solid-state cooling/heating within single materials. In comparison to the complex module structures required for the conventional Seebeck and Peltier effects, the transverse thermoelectric effects provide the complete device structures, potentially resolving the fundamental issue of multi-module degradation of thermoelectric conversion performance. This review article provides an overview of all currently known transverse thermoelectric conversion phenomena and principles, as well as their characteristics, and reclassifies them in a unified manner. The performance of the transverse thermoelectric generator, refrigerator, and active cooler is formulated, showing that thermal boundary conditions play an essential role in discussion on their behaviors. Examples of recent application research and material development in transverse thermoelectrics are also introduced, followed by a discussion of future prospects.

Title: Spin non-Collinear Real-Time Time-Dependent Density-Functional Theory and Implementation in the Modern GPU-Accelerated INQ code
Authors: Jacopo Simoni, Xavier Andrade, Wuzhang Fang, Andrew C.Grieder, Alfredo A. Correa, Tadashi Ogitsu, Yuan Ping
Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a theory that describes the time evolution of quantum mechanical many-electron systems under the influence of external time-dependent electric and magnetic fields. INQ is a specially designed software to efficiently solve the real-time TDDFT equations on graphics processing units (GPUs), which aim to overcome the computational limitation of time and size scales of non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. In this work we will present an implementation of non-collinear TDDFT for the INQ code to simulate spin dynamics in real time and discuss the implementation of non-collinear magnetic effects into the code. We will discuss the implementation of exchange-correlation magnetic fields, spin-orbit coupling, and the interaction between the electronic system and external magnetic fields. We will then consider several prototypical examples of spin dynamics in magnetic clusters and solids after light excitation. Potential applications range from the study of real-time dynamics of magnons to ultrafast spin dynamics under linear and circularly polarized laser excitation, as well as spectroscopic signatures such as magnetic circular dichroism and pump-probe Kerr rotation.

Title: Time- and Polarization-Resolved Extreme Ultraviolet Momentum Microscopy
Authors: Sotirios Fragkos, Quentin Courtade, Olena Tkach, Jérôme Gaudin, Dominique Descamps, Guillaume Barrette, Stéphane Petit, Gerd Schönhense, Yann Mairesse, Samuel Beaulieu
Abstract: We report the development of an instrument combining an ultrafast, high-repetition-rate, polarization-tunable monochromatic extreme ultraviolet (XUV, 21.6 eV) beamline and a next-generation momentum microscope endstation. This setup enables time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of quantum materials, offering multimodal photoemission dichroism capabilities. The momentum microscope simultaneously detects the full surface Brillouin zone over an extended binding energy range. It is equipped with advanced electron optics, including a new type of front lens that supports multiple operational modes. Enhanced spatial resolution is achieved by combining the small XUV beam footprint (33 $\mu$m by 45 $\mu$m) with the selection of small regions of interest using apertures positioned in the Gaussian plane of the momentum microscope. This instrument achieves an energy resolution of 44 meV and a temporal resolution of 144 fs. We demonstrate the capability to perform linear, Fourier, and circular dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions from photoexcited 2D materials. This functionality paves the way for time-, energy-, and momentum-resolved investigations of orbital and quantum geometrical properties underlying electronic structures of quantum materials driven out of equilibrium.

Title: Thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the cuprate pseudogap: reconciling Fermi arcs and hole pockets
Authors: Harshit Pandey, Maine Christos, Pietro M. Bonetti, Ravi Shanker, Alexander Nikolaenko, Sayantan Sharma, Subir Sachdev
Abstract: The cuprate pseudogap phase displays Fermi arc spectral weight in photoemission and scanning tunneling microscopy, while recent magnetotransport observations yield evidence for the existence of hole pockets of fractional area $p/8$, where $p$ is the doping density. We reconcile these observations by a Monte Carlo study of a SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the background spin liquid of a fractionalized Fermi liquid of hole pockets. At the higher temperatures of the pseudogap, the inevitable finite-doping sign problem can be evaded by including only thermal fluctuations of the SU(2) gauge field and a charge $e$ Higgs boson, while the fermionic critical Dirac spinons and electrons are treated exactly. Our study also describes the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity by expulsion of vortices with flux $h/(2e)$, each with charge-order halos. We predict that quantum oscillations of hole pockets of area $p/8$ should be observable in clean under-hole-doped cuprates in regimes with a positive Hall co-efficient and without charge order, in contrast to existing quantum oscillation observations of electron pockets induced by charge density wave order.

Title: Temporal modulation of second harmonic generation in ferroelectrics by a pulsed electric field
Authors: Atsushi Ono
Abstract: We revisit the relationship between electric polarization modulation $\Delta P$ in ferroelectrics induced by a low-frequency pulsed electric field and the corresponding second harmonic intensity modulation $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Using nonlinear response theory, we derive their time-domain expressions linear in the pulse amplitude, revealing that not only the electric field but also its time derivative contributes to $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Furthermore, even when the time-derivative component is negligible, $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can be in antiphase with the pulsed field and thus with $\Delta P$. These theoretical predictions are further supported by real-time simulations of a model for electronic ferroelectrics. Our results demonstrate that the commonly assumed relation $\Delta P \propto \Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can break down under certain conditions, reflecting the complex-valued and frequency-dependent nature of nonlinear dynamical susceptibilities.

Title: CoS++: Towards More General and Explicit Implementations for Sampling High-Order Feynman Diagrammatic Series
Authors: Boyuan Shi
Abstract: Diagrammatic Monte Carlo methods provide robust routines for accurate computations of correlated electronic systems in the thermodynamical limit. Recently, its versatility was extended to SU(N) Hubbard model, where the core is a novel dynamical programming approach to the summation of all connected Feynman diagrams. We present several generalizations of it with more interaction vertices and symmetry broken terms. The framework treats SU(N) symmetry breaking both from nonuniform, flavor-dependent chemical potentials and from spontaneously broken phases induced by shift parameters. We also provide an end-to-end GPU acceleration path with dedicated CUDA C++ optimizations independent of a previous CUDA acceleration approach, where the parallelization strategy is different. We performed detailed numerical study of new algorithms involved in this article and exposed numerical instabilities of connected determinant formalism, which we solved in multiple ways. Together, these advances establish a scalable, high-performance DiagMC toolbox for multi-flavor correlated systems with and without symmetry breaking.

Title: Observation of Self-Bound Droplets of Ultracold Dipolar Molecules
Authors: Siwei Zhang, Weijun Yuan, Niccolò Bigagli, Haneul Kwak, Tijs Karman, Ian Stevenson, Sebastian Will
Abstract: Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.

Title: Gradient-based grand canonical optimization enabled by graph neural networks with fractional atomic existence
Authors: Mads-Peter Verner Christiansen, Bjørk Hammer
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials have become an indispensable tool for materials science, enabling the study of larger systems and longer timescales. State-of-the-art models are generally graph neural networks that employ message passing to iteratively update atomic embeddings that are ultimately used for predicting properties. In this work we extend the message passing formalism with the inclusion of a continuous variable that accounts for fractional atomic existence. This allows us to calculate the gradient of the Gibbs free energy with respect to both the Cartesian coordinates of atoms and their existence. Using this we propose a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method and document its capabilities for a Cu(110) surface oxide.

Title: Multiple Topological Phases Controlled via Strain in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets
Authors: Zesen Fu, Mengli Hu, Aolin Li, Haiming Duan, Junwei Liu, Fangping Ouyang
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) are an emergent class of magnetic materials that combine properties of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, exhibiting spin-polarized Fermi surfaces and zero net magnetic moment due to combined time-reversal and crystal symmetry. Here, we construct a Kondo-lattice model on a two-dimensional square Lieb lattice to investigate the topological properties of AMs. We identify a type-II quantum spin Hall state characterized by spin-polarized counterpropagating edge states. Breaking the $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, which connects magnetic sublattices, induces a transition to a quantum anomalous Hall state. We further establish a strain-induced mechanism to control these topological phase transitions and present the corresponding phase diagram. Finally, we demonstrate the predicted transitions in monolayer CrO, a realistic altermagnetic candidate, using first-principles calculations. Our findings highlight the potential of 2D AMs as a versatile platform for topological spintronics, enabling strain-tunable helical and chiral edge states within a single system.

Title: EAC-Net: Predicting real-space charge density via equivariant atomic contributions
Authors: Xuejian Qin, Taoyuze Lv, Zhicheng Zhong
Abstract: Charge density is central to density functional theory (DFT), as it fully defines the ground-state properties of a material system. Obtaining it with high accuracy is a computational bottleneck. Existing machine learning models are constrained by trade-offs among accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Here, we introduce the Equivariant Atomic Contribution Network (EAC-Net), which couples atoms and grids to integrate the strengths of grid-based and basis-function frameworks. EAC-Net achieves high accuracy (typically below 1% error), enhanced efficiency, and strong generalization across complex systems. Building on this framework, we develop EAC-mp, a universal charge density model covering the periodic table. The model demonstrates robust zero-shot performance across diverse systems, and generalizes beyond the training distribution, supporting downstream applications such as band structure calculations. By linking local chemical environments to charge densities, EAC-Net provides a scalable framework for accelerating electronic structure prediction and enabling high-throughput materials discovery.

Title: Intertwined Electron Pairing in the Bilayer Two-orbital Kanamori-Hubbard Model: a Unified Picture of Two Superconductivities in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$
Authors: Shi-cong Mo, Yao-yuan Zheng, Wéi Wú
Abstract: The mechanism of superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ bulk and film superconductors remains actively debated. Here, we investigate the bilayer two-orbital Kanamori-Hubbard model for $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ using cellular dynamical mean-field theory. We discover two intertwined $s_{\pm}-$ wave superconductivities with distinct physical origins. We show that when the $d_{z^2}$ orbital is under-doped, electron pairing associated to Hund's coupling $J_H$ prevails. As $d_{z^2}$ hole-doping $\delta_z$ increases, a second superconductivity, which is largely insensitive to $J_H$ but exhibiting a critical reliance on the $d_{z^2}$ - $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hybridization $V$, arises. These two primary pairing states exhibit comparable maximum transition temperatures $T_c$, and evolve from one to the other following a smooth $T_c$ versus $\delta_z$ relation. A stark particle-hole asymmetry is observed in the superconducting phase diagram, indicating the crucial role played by the $\gamma-$ band of $d_{z^2}$ orbital in pairing. Our results present a picture unifying the two possible pairing mechanisms in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ superconductors. We discuss the implications of our findings to recent experiments.

Title: Molecular augmented dynamics: Generating experimentally consistent atomistic structures by design
Authors: Tigany Zarrouk, Miguel A. Caro
Abstract: A fundamental objective of materials modeling is identifying atomic structures that align with experimental observables. Conventional approaches for disordered materials involve sampling from thermodynamic ensembles and hoping for an experimental match. This process is inefficient and offers no guarantee of success. We present a method based on modified molecular dynamics, that we call molecular augmented dynamics (MAD), which identifies structures that simultaneously match multiple experimental observables and exhibit low energies as described by a machine learning interatomic potential (MLP) trained from ab-initio data. We demonstrate its feasibility by finding representative structures of glassy carbon, nanoporous carbon, ta-C, a-C:D and a-CO$_x$ that match their respective experimental observables -- X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, pair distribution function and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data -- using the same initial structure and underlying MLP. The method is general, accepting any experimental observable whose simulated counterpart can be cast as a function of differentiable atomic descriptors. This method enables a computational "microscope" into experimental structures.

Authors: Anna Krasznai, Sergei Rutkevich, Gábor Takács
Abstract: We examine the dynamics of the three-state Potts quantum spin chain in the extreme ferromagnetic regime using perturbation theory in the transverse magnetic field. We demonstrate that this approach provides access to features well beyond the semiclassical method applied previously, including the description of resonant excitations and analytic prediction for the time evolution after a quantum quench. We also demonstrate that it agrees with the meson/bubble spectrum results from exact diagonalisation and the numerical simulations of the time evolution.

Title: Transient localization from fractionalization: vanishingly small heat conductivity in gapless quantum magnets
Authors: Shi Feng, Penghao Zhu, Johannes Knolle, Michael Knap
Abstract: Several candidate materials for gapless quantum spin liquids exhibit a vanishing thermal conductivity, which is at odds with theoretical predictions. Here, we show that a suppressed response can arise due to transient localization from fractionalization, even in the absence of extrinsic defects or disorder. Concretely, we consider a Kitaev ladder model in a uniform magnetic field, whose spin degrees of freedom fractionalize into visons and spinons. For moderate magnetic fields, visons are heavy and act as quasi-static disorder that induce transient localization of light spinons even in the translation-invariant model and at zero temperature, which strongly suppresses the residual conductivity at finite but low frequencies. At ultralow frequencies the conductivity is restored; however, such scales can be extremely hard to reach in experiments. Our results identify transient localization as a signature of fractionalization and provide a framework for interpreting anomalous transport in gapless spin liquid candidates.

Title: Insertion space in repulsive active matter
Authors: Luke K. Davis, Karel Proesmans
Abstract: For equilibrium hard spheres the stochastic geometry of the insertion space, the room to accommodate another sphere, relates exactly to the equation of state. We begin to extend this idea to active matter, analyzing insertion space for repulsive active particles in one and two dimensions using both on- and off-lattice models. In 1D we derive closed-form expressions for the mean insertion cavity size, cavity number, and total insertion volume, all in excellent agreement with simulations. Strikingly, activity increases the total insertion volume and tends to keep the insertion space more connected. These results provide the first quantitative foundation for the stochastic geometry of active matter, and opens up a new route to building a thermodynamics of active systems.

Title: Odd-parity longitudinal magnetoconductivity in time-reversal symmetry broken materials
Authors: Sunit Das, Akash Adhikary, Divya Sahani, Aveek Bid, Amit Agarwal
Abstract: Magnetotransport measurements are a sensitive probe of symmetry and electronic structure in quantum materials. While conventional metals exhibit longitudinal magnetoconductivity that is even in a magnetic field ($B$) for small $B$, we show that magnetic materials which intrinsically break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) show an {\it odd-parity magnetoconductivity} (OMC), with a leading linear-$B$ response. Using semiclassical transport theory, we derive explicit expressions for the longitudinal and transverse conductivities and identify their origin in Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment. Crystalline symmetry analysis shows that longitudinal OMC follows the same point-group constraints as the anomalous Hall effect, while transverse OMC obeys distinct rules, providing an independent probe of TRS breaking. In the large $B$ quantum oscillation regime, we uncover both odd- and even-$B$ contributions, demonstrating OMC beyond the semiclassical picture. Explicit calculations in valley-polarized gapped graphene show that OMC peaks near the band edges, vanish in the band gap and follow the temperature dependence of the magnetic order parameter. Our results explain the odd-parity magnetoresistance recently observed in magnetized graphene and establish OMC as a robust transport signature of intrinsic TRS breaking in metals.

Title: Effective delocalization in the one-dimensional Anderson model with stealthy disorder
Authors: Carlo Vanoni, Boris L. Altshuler, Paul J. Steinhardt, Salvatore Torquato
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the Anderson model in one dimension with "stealthy" disorder, defined as having a power spectrum that vanishes in a continuous band of wave numbers. Motivated by recent studies on the optical transparency properties of stealthy hyperuniform layered media, we compute the localization length via the perturbation theory expansion of the self-energy. We find that, for fixed energy and small but finite disorder strength $W$, there exists for any finite length system a range of stealthiness $\chi$ for which the localization length exceeds the system size. This kind of "effective delocalization" is the result of the novel kind of correlated disorder that spans a continuous range of length scales, a defining characteristic of stealthy systems. Unlike uncorrelated disorder, for which the localization length $\xi$ scales as $W^{-2}$ to leading order for small W, the leading order terms in the perturbation expansion of $\xi$ for stealthy disordered systems vanish identically for a progressively large number of terms as $\chi$ increases such that $\xi$ scales as $W^{-2n}$ with arbitrarily large $n$. Moreover, we support our analytical results with numerical simulations. Our results may serve as a first step in investigating the role of stealthy disorder in quantum systems, which is of both theoretical and experimental relevance.

Title: Supervised and Unsupervised Deep Learning Applied to the Majority Vote Model
Authors: J. F. Silva Neto, D. S. M. Alencar, L. T. Brito, G. A. Alves, F. W. S. Lima, A. Macedo-Filho, R. S. Ferreira, T. F. A. Alves
Abstract: We employ deep learning techniques to investigate the critical properties of the continuous phase transition in the majority vote model. In addition to deep learning, principal component analysis is utilized to analyze the transition. For supervised learning, dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. Using independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the critical point. Variational autoencoders also serve as generative models, producing artificial spin configurations.

Title: Quenched properties of the Spectral Form Factor
Authors: Dimitrios Charamis, Manas Kulkarni, Jorge Kurchan, Laura Foini
Abstract: The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.

Title: Coupled Interfacial Phenomena Suppress Propulsion in Catalytic Janus Colloids
Authors: Muhammad Haroon, Christopher Wirth
Abstract: Platinum-coated polystyrene Janus particles exhibit a combination of stochastic and deterministic motion in hydrogen peroxide solutions, making them promising candidates for applications in micro-scale cargo transport, drug delivery, and environmental remediation. The dynamics of Janus particles very near a boundary are dictated by conservative and non-conservative interactions that depend on particle, substrate, and solution properties. This study investigated the influence of orientational quenching by measuring the effect of changes in cap thickness and hydrogen peroxide concentration on particle velocity and maximum displacement. Janus particles with cap thicknesses of 3 nm, 7 nm, 10 nm, 20 nm, and 35 nm were analyzed in 1 wt./vol.% and 3 wt./vol.% hydrogen peroxide solutions near the bottom and top boundaries of the fluid cell. Results indicated that particles with lower cap thicknesses exhibit higher velocities, with faster particles in 3 wt./vol.% peroxide as compared to 1 wt./vol.% peroxide. Furthermore, results suggest a combined influence of activity and gravitational effects influenced whether particles moved along the top boundary i.e. ceiling or bottom boundary i.e. flooring. Heavier cap particles in lower peroxide concentration solution show less ceiling than lighter cap particles in higher peroxide concentration. We also find a global reduction in velocity for when a single surface of the two is plasma cleaned surface. These findings highlight the important interplay between cap weight, hydrodynamic interactions, and propulsion force in determining the dynamics of Janus particles.

Title: White-box machine learning for uncovering physically interpretable dimensionless governing equations for granular materials
Authors: Xu Han, Lu Jing, Chung-Yee Kwok, Gengchao Yang, Yuri Dumaresq Sobral
Abstract: Granular material has significant implications for industrial and geophysical processes. A long-lasting challenge, however, is seeking a unified rheology for its solid- and liquid-like behaviors under quasi-static, inertial, and even unsteady shear conditions. Here, we present a data-driven framework to discover the hidden governing equation of sheared granular materials. The framework, PINNSR-DA, addresses noisy discrete particle data via physics-informed neural networks with sparse regression (PINNSR) and ensures dimensional consistency via machine learning-based dimensional analysis (DA). Applying PINNSR-DA to our discrete element method simulations of oscillatory shear flow, a general differential equation is found to govern the effective friction across steady and transient states. The equation consists of three interpretable terms, accounting respectively for linear response, nonlinear response and energy dissipation of the granular system, and the coefficients depends primarily on a dimensionless relaxation time, which is shorter for stiffer particles and thicker flow layers. This work pioneers a pathway for discovering physically interpretable governing laws in granular systems and can be readily extended to more complex scenarios involving jamming, segregation, and fluid-particle interactions.

Title: Zero-field Anomalous Hall Effect in Bulk Single Crystal Mn3Ir
Authors: Xin Gu, Ruoqi Wang, Bo Zhao, Haofu Wen, Kunquan Hong, Shijun Yuan, Taishi Chen, Jinlan Wang
Abstract: The L1_2-phase non-collinear antiferromagnet (AFM) Mn_3Ir has emerged as a pioneering platform for realizing the zero-field anomalous Hall effect (AHE), thereby catalyzing rapid advances in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Despite its significant potential, experimental investigations of the intrinsic magnetic and electronic properties of Mn_3Ir have been greatly hindered by the formidable challenges in growing bulk single crystals. Here, we report the growth of stoichiometric Mn_3Ir bulk single crystals and their characterization in terms of magnetization and the AHE. Using a high-throughput flux method, we obtained (111)-oriented hexagonal Mn_3Ir single crystals. A small AHE signal was detected, which we attribute to the coexistence of A- and B-type antiferromagnetic domains that mutually cancel the net AHE response. Our results reveal key aspects of the intrinsic magnetic properties and AHE in bulk Mn_3Ir, providing a critical material platform for the development of advanced spintronic devices.

Title: A basis-free, octonionic criterion for Weyl points in solids
Authors: Christian Tantardini
Abstract: Standard ways of locating and characterizing Weyl points--Berry-flux integrals on small spheres and local $k\cdot p$ fits--are topologically sound but depend on user choices (sphere center/radius, gauge smoothing, surface charting, and Pauli-frame transport) that complicate high-throughput workflows. We introduce a local, basis-free criterion that avoids these knobs by using the octonionic geometry of $\operatorname{Im}\mathbb{O}\cong\mathbb{R}^7$. From a smooth two-band projector we build a unit octonion field $u(\mathbf{k})$ and its octonionic connection $\mathcal{A}_i=\operatorname{Im}(\bar u\,\partial_{k_i}u)$. Contracting the three directional derivatives with the $\mathrm{G}_2$-invariant three-form produces a pseudoscalar density whose sign gives the node's chirality. A companion quantity--the octonionic associator--vanishes at leading order precisely when the local three directions close inside an associative (quaternionic) three-plane; its smallness thus provides an intrinsic, pointwise self-consistency check that the two-band reduction is valid. The construction is invariant under $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge changes of the two-band subspace and under $\mathrm{G}_2$ rotations of its completion, and it eliminates enclosing surfaces and gauge seams. In the linear regime the density reduces to the oriented volume set by the velocity matrix, thereby agreeing with the Chern number on a small sphere and with the chirality obtained from a $k\cdot p$ linearization. We outline a practical stencil-based algorithm compatible with Wannier tight-binding Hamiltonians and demonstrate robustness to benign numerical choices, while providing an intrinsic warning signal near band entanglement or multi-fold touchings.

Title: Intrinsic defect intolerance in the ultra-pure metal PtSn$_4$
Authors: Samikshya Sahu, Dong Chen, Niclas Heinsdorf, Ashley N. Warner, Markus Altthaler, Ashutosh K. Singh, Douglas A. Bonn, Sarah A. Burke, Alannah M. Hallas
Abstract: Ultra-pure materials are highly valued as model systems for the study of intrinsic physics. Frequently, however, the crystal growth of such pristine samples requires significant optimization. PtSn$_4$ is a rare example of a material that naturally forms with a very low concentration of crystalline defects. Here, we investigate the origin of its low defect levels using a combination of electrical resistivity measurements, computational modeling, and scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. While typical flux-grown crystals of PtSn$_4$ can have residual resistivity ratios (RRRs) that exceed 1000, we show that even at the most extreme formation speeds, the RRR cannot be suppressed below 100. This aversion to defect formation extends to both the Pt and Sn sublattices, which contribute with equal weight to the conduction properties. Direct local imaging with scanning tunneling microscopy further substantiates the rarity of point defects, while the prohibitive energetic cost of forming a defect is demonstrated through density functional theory calculations. Taken together, our results establish PtSn$_4$ as an intrinsically defect-intolerant material, making it an ideal platform to study other properties of interest, including extreme magnetoresistance and topology.

Title: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in three-dimensional PT- and PC-symmetric class CI band structures
Authors: Ken Shiozaki
Abstract: We construct a previously missing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant for three-dimensional band structures in symmetry class CI defined by parity-time (PT) and parity-particle-hole (PC) symmetries. PT symmetry allows one to define a real Berry connection and, based on the $\eta$-invariant, a spin-Chern--Simons (spin-CS) action. We show that PC symmetry quantizes the spin-CS action to $\{0,2\pi\}$ with $4\pi$ periodicity, thereby yielding a well-defined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant. This invariant is additive under direct sums of isolated band structures, reduces to a known $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index when a global Takagi factorization exists, and in general depends on the choice of spin structure. Finally, we demonstrate lattice models in which this newly introduced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant distinguishes topological phases that cannot be detected by the previously known topological indices.

Title: Generalized Li-Haldane Correspondence in Critical Free-Fermion Systems
Authors: Yuxuan Guo, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu
Abstract: Topological phenomena in quantum critical systems have recently attracted growing attention, as they go beyond the traditional paradigms of condensed matter and statistical physics. However, a general framework for identifying such nontrivial phenomena, particularly in higher-dimensional systems, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we propose a universal fingerprint for detecting nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems protected by global on-site symmetries. Specifically, we analytically establish an exact relation between the bulk entanglement spectrum and the boundary energy spectrum at topological criticality in arbitrary dimensions, demonstrating that the degeneracy of edge modes can be extracted from the bulk entanglement spectrum. These findings, further supported by numerical simulations of lattice models, provide a universal fingerprint for identifying nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems.

Title: Hierarchy of timescales in a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder
Authors: Kadir Çeven, Lukas Peinemann, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner
Abstract: Understanding the timescales associated with relaxation to equilibrium in closed quantum many-body systems is one of the central focuses in the study of their non-equilibrium dynamics. At late times, these relaxation processes exhibit universal behavior, emerging from the inherent randomness of chaotic Hamiltonians. In this work, we investigate a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder - an experimentally realizable model known for its diffusive dynamics - to explore the connection between transport properties and spectral measures derived solely from the system's energy levels via these relaxation timescales. We begin by analyzing the spectral form factor, which yields the time when the system begins to follow the random matrix theory (RMT) statistics, known as the RMT time. We then determine the Thouless times - the average times for a local excitation to diffuse across the entire finite system - through the linear-response theory for both spin and energy transport. Our numerical results confirm that the RMT time scales quadratically with system size and upper bounds the Thouless times. Interestingly, we also find that, unlike other non-integrable models, spin diffusion proceeds faster than energy diffusion.

Title: Atomistic Insights into Cu/amorphous-Ta$_x$N Interfacial Adhesion via Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: Effects of Stoichiometry and Interface Construction
Authors: Jeong Min Choi, Jaehoon Kim, Ji-Hwan Lee, Won-Joon Son, Seungwu Han
Abstract: Accurate understanding and control of interfacial adhesion between Cu and Ta$_x$N diffusion barriers are essential for ensuring the mechanical reliability and integrity of Cu interconnect systems in semiconductor devices. Amorphous tantalum nitride (a-Ta$_x$N) barriers are particularly attractive due to their superior barrier performance, attributed to the absence of grain boundaries. However, a systematic atomistic investigation of how varying Ta stoichiometries influences adhesion strength at Cu/a-Ta$_x$N interfaces remains lacking, hindering a comprehensive understanding of interface optimization strategies. In this study, we employ machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to perform steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations of Cu/a-Ta$_x$N interfaces. We simultaneously evaluate three distinct interface construction approaches--static relaxation, high-temperature annealing, and simulated Cu deposition--to comprehensively investigate their influence on adhesion strength across varying Ta compositions ($x=1, 2, 4$). Peak force and work of adhesion values from SMD simulations quantitatively characterize interface strength, while atomic stress and strain analyses elucidate detailed deformation behavior, highlighting the critical role of interfacial morphologies. Additionally, we explore the atomistic mechanisms underlying cohesive failure, revealing how targeted incorporation of Ta atoms into Cu layers enhances the cohesive strength of the interface. This study demonstrates how MLIP-driven simulations can elucidate atomic-scale relationships between interface morphology and adhesion behavior, providing insights that can guide future atomistic engineering strategies toward enhancing intrinsic barrier adhesion, potentially enabling liner-free interconnect technologies.

Title: Dimer-driven multiple reentrant localization with composite potential
Authors: Pei-Jie Chang, Dong Ruan, Gui-Lu Long
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed reentrant localization transitions in quasi-periodic one-dimensional lattices, where the competition between dimerized hopping and staggered disorder plays a central role. Yet the extent to which such reentrant localization persists under more general conditions, such as additional periodic potentials, modified quasi-periodic modulations remains unclear. Here we investigate localization phenomena in a one-dimensional lattice subject to a periodic potential and an additional quasi-periodic modulation. Using both eigenstate-based indicators and experimentally accessible dynamical observables, we identify robust reentrant, or multiple, localization transitions. We show that these transitions are uniquely stabilized by the dimer structure of the unit cell, where the competition between the onsite periodic potential and the quasi-periodic modulation becomes most pronounced. By systematically varying the periodicity parameter $\alpha$ and the quasi-periodic frequency $\beta$, we find that the robust multiple reentrant localization behavior disappears for any deviation from the dimer configuration, confirming its essential role. Our results suggest that the interplay between these competing factors drives the multiple reentrant localization transitions.

Title: Extending the optical absorption in a lumped element meander structure to far-infrared wavelengths
Authors: Shekhar Chandra Pandey, Shilpam Sharma, Anudeep Singh, Utkarsh Pandey, S. S. Prabhu, Bhaskar Biswas, Sona Chandran, M. K. Chattopadhyay
Abstract: Superconducting radiation detectors typically exhibit detection and single photon sensitivity limited to the mid infrared wavelength range. Extending their detection capabilities into the far infrared range (>10 um) requires careful selection of substrate materials and detector geometries. The overall detection efficiency is linked to absorption and coupling efficiencies. In this study, the resonator geometry and absorption efficiency were estimated using electromagnetic simulations in CST Microwave Studio for a lumped-element meander structure. Simulations were performed for the 12 to 50 um wavelength range, corresponding to the Infrared Free Electron Laser (IR FEL) at RRCAT, Indore. Absorption in the meander inductor was influenced by the substrate material, thickness, and impedance matching between the detector and incident photon medium. The results indicate that SiO2 and diamond substrates are suitable for developing lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKID) in this range. Optimized meander geometries on diamond substrates demonstrated absorption efficiencies of up to 95% for narrow bandwidths and over 50% for wide bandwidths. A 30-pixel LEKID structure was fabricated using electron beam lithography on a 500 um SiO2 coated Si substrate, with a 20 nm thick Ti40V60 alloy resonator. Experimental absorption efficiency was determined through transmission and reflection measurements. Results show that in the 14 to 26 um IR-FEL range, the LEKID achieved up to 75% absorption efficiency. These studies demonstrate that the LEKID structure is ideal for detecting far infrared wavelengths above 10 um, with high absorption efficiency.

Title: Non-diagonal open spin-1/2 XXZ quantum chains by separation of variables: Complete spectrum and matrix elements of some quasi-local operators
Authors: G. Niccoli
Abstract: The integrable quantum models, associated to the transfer matrices of the 6-vertex reflection algebra for spin 1/2 representations, are studied in this paper. In the framework of Sklyanin's quantum separation of variables (SOV), we provide the complete characterization of the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the transfer matrix and the proof of the simplicity of the transfer matrix spectrum. Moreover, we use these integrable quantum models as further key examples for which to develop a method in the SOV framework to compute matrix elements of local operators. This method has been introduced first in [1] and then used also in [2], it is based on the resolution of the quantum inverse problem (i.e. the reconstruction of all local operators in terms of the quantum separate variables) plus the computation of the action of separate covectors on separate vectors. In particular, for these integrable quantum models, which in the homogeneous limit reproduce the open spin-1/2 XXZ quantum chains with non-diagonal boundary conditions, we have obtained the SOV-reconstructions for a class of quasi-local operators and determinant formulae for the covector-vector actions. As consequence of these findings we provide one determinant formulae for the matrix elements of this class of reconstructed quasi-local operators on transfer matrix eigenstates.

Title: Certifying quantum enhancements in thermal machines beyond the Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation
Authors: José A. Almanza-Marrero, Gonzalo Manzano
Abstract: Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. Introducing a comparison with classical machines using the same set of thermodynamic resources, we show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage under mild conditions. This advantage applies to both cases where the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators: the three-level amplifier, the three-qubit autonomous refrigerator, and a noise-induced-coherence machine.

Title: Achieving quantum advantage in a search for a violations of the Goldbach conjecture, with driven atoms in tailored potentials
Authors: Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Andrea Trombettoni, Giuseppe Mussardo, Maxim Olshanii
Abstract: The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p^{\text{(I)}}$ and $p^{\text{(II)}}$. In this article we propose a quantum analogue device that solves the following problem: given a small prime $p^{\text{(I)}}$, identify a member $N$ of a $\mathcal{N}$-strong set even numbers for which $N-p^{\text{(I)}}$ is also a prime. A table of suitable large primes $p^{\text{(II)}}$ is assumed to be known a priori. The device realizes the Grover quantum search protocol and as such ensures a $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}}$ quantum advantage. Our numerical example involves a set of 51 even numbers just above the highest even classical-numerically explored so far [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation {\bf 83}, 2033 (2013)]. For a given small prime number $p^{\text{(I)}}=223$, it took our quantum algorithm 5 steps to identify the number $N=4\times 10^{18}+14$ as featuring a Goldbach partition involving $223$ and another prime, namely $p^{\text{(II)}}=4\times 10^{18}-239$. Currently, our algorithm limits the number of evens to be tested simultaneously to $\mathcal{N} \sim \ln(N)$: larger samples will typically contain more than one even that can be partitioned with the help of a given $p^{\text{(I)}}$, thus leading to a departure from the Grover paradigm.

Title: Hilbert space representation for quasi-Hermitian position-deformed Heisenberg algebra and Path integral formulation
Authors: Thomas Katsekpor, Latévi M. Lawson, Prince K. Osei, Ibrahim Nonkané
Abstract: Position deformation of a Heisenberg algebra and Hilbert space representation of both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties may lead to loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Consequently, the Hamiltonian operator constructed from these operators are also not Hermitian. In the present paper, with an appropriate positive-definite Dyson map, we establish the Hermiticity of these operators by means of a quasi-similarity transformation. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these quasi-Hermitian operators that generate a quasi-Hermitian Heisenberg algebra. With the help of these representations we establish the path integral formulation of any systems in this quasi-Hermitian algebra. Finally, using the path integral of a free particle as an example, we demonstrate that the Euclidean propagator, action, and kinetic energy of this system are constrained by the standard classical mechanics limits.

Title: Optimal thresholds and algorithms for a model of multi-modal learning in high dimensions
Authors: Christian Keup, Lenka Zdeborová
Abstract: This work explores multi-modal inference in a high-dimensional simplified model, analytically quantifying the performance gain of multi-modal inference over that of analyzing modalities in isolation. We present the Bayes-optimal performance and recovery thresholds in a model where the objective is to recover the latent structures from two noisy data matrices with correlated spikes. The paper derives the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for this model and characterizes its performance in the high-dimensional limit via the associated state evolution. The analysis holds for a broad range of priors and noise channels, which can differ across modalities. The linearization of AMP is compared numerically to the widely used partial least squares (PLS) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) methods, which are both observed to suffer from a sub-optimal recovery threshold.

Title: Thermal and Quantum Phase Transitions of the $ϕ^4$ Model
Authors: István Gábor Márián, Andrea Trombettoni, István Nándori
Abstract: In this paper we discuss and revisit the finite temperature extension of the renormalization group (RG) treatment of $T=0$ field theories, focusing as a case study on the $\phi^4$ model. We first discuss the extension of RG equations of the very same model from $T=0$ to finite $T$ in the usual way by resorting to sums on the Matsubara frequencies and fixing the physical temperature parameter $T$. We show that this approach, although useful for a variety of applications, may lead to the disappearance of the critical points as extracted from the RG flow. Since the identification of fixed points is key in the study of classical and quantum phase transitions, wepropose a modification of the usual finite-temperature RG approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale, $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ where $k_T$ is the running cutoff for thermal, and $k$ is for the quantum fluctuations. Once introduced this dimensionless temperature $\tau$, we investigate the consequences on the thermal RG approach for the $\phi^4$ model and construct its phase diagram. Finally, we formulate requirements for the phase diagram of the $\phi^4$ theory based on known properties of the quantum and classical phase diagrams of the Ising model.

Title: Superfluids in expanding backgrounds and attractor times
Authors: Guri K. Buza, Toshali Mitra, Alexander Soloviev
Abstract: We determine the behavior of an out-of-equilibrium superfluid, composed of a $U(1)$ Goldstone mode coupled to hydrodynamic modes in a M\" uller-Israel-Stewart theory, in expanding backgrounds relevant to heavy ion collision experiments and cosmology. For suitable initial conditions, the evolution of the hydrodynamic variables leads to a change in the potential of the Goldstone mode, spontaneously breaking the symmetry. After some time, the condensate becomes small, leading the system evolution to be well described via hydrodynamic attractors for a timescale that we determine in Bjorken and Gubser flows. We define this new timescale as the \textit{attractor time} and show its dependence on initial conditions. In the case of the Gubser flow, we provide for the first time a complete description of the nonlinear evolution of the system, including a novel nonlinear regime of constant anisotropy not found in the Bjorken evolution. Finally, we consider the superfluid in the dynamical FLRW (Friedmann-Lemaitre-Roberston-Walker) background, where we observe a similar attractor behavior, dependent on the initial conditions, that at late times approaches a regime dominated by the condensate.

Title: Casimir effect in magnetic dual chiral density waves
Authors: Daisuke Fujii, Katsumasa Nakayama, Kei Suzuki
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the Casimir effect originating from Dirac fields in finite-density matter under a magnetic field. In particular, we focus on quark fields in the magnetic dual chiral density wave (MDCDW) phase as a possible inhomogeneous ground state of interacting Dirac-fermion systems. In this system, the distance dependence of Casimir energy shows a complex oscillatory behavior by the interplay between the chemical potential, magnetic field, and inhomogeneous ground state. By decomposing the total Casimir energy into contributions of each Landau level, we elucidate what types of Casimir effects are realized from each Landau level: the lowest or some types of higher Landau levels lead to different behaviors of Casimir energies. Furthermore, we point out characteristic behaviors due to level splitting between different fermion flavors, i.e., up/down quarks. These findings provide new insights into Dirac-fermion (or quark) matter with a finite thickness.

Title: Digital-Analog Simulations of Schrödinger Cat States in the Dicke-Ising Model
Authors: Dmitriy S. Shapiro, Yannik Weber, Tim Bode, Frank K. Wilhelm, Dmitry Bagrets
Abstract: The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''. Here, we propose a digital-analog quantum simulator for this model based on an ensemble of interacting qubits coupled to a single-mode photonic resonator. We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schrödinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.

Title: Meson dynamics from locally exciting a particle-conserving $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory
Authors: Vaibhav Sharma, Kaden R. A. Hazzard
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is an important avenue to gain insights into both particle physics phenomena and constrained quantum many-body dynamics. There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy collision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on current quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined mesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a particle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple, experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact numerics.

Title: Enhancement of superconducting pairing via quantum Lyapunov control
Authors: Oleksandr Povitchan, Denys I. Bondar, Andrii G. Sotnikov
Abstract: We demonstrate that quantum Lyapunov control provides an effective strategy for enhancing superconducting correlations in the Fermi-Hubbard model without requiring careful parameter tuning. While photoinduced superconductivity is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of a monochromatic laser pulse, our approach employs a simple feedback-based protocol that prevents the decrease of superconducting correlations once they begin to form. This method enables robust enhancement of pairing across a broad range of initial pumping conditions, eliminating the need for intricate frequency and amplitude optimization. We also show that an alternative implementation, asymptotic quantum control, achieves comparable results. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to suppress previously induced superconducting correlations, providing bidirectional control over quantum pairing states. These findings suggest practical pathways for manipulating quantum correlations in strongly interacting systems with minimal experimental complexity.

Title: ScarFinder: a detector of optimal scar trajectories in quantum many-body dynamics
Authors: Jie Ren, Andrew Hallam, Lei Ying, Zlatko Papić
Abstract: Mechanisms that give rise to coherent quantum dynamics, such as quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest as a way of controlling quantum chaos. However, identifying the presence of quantum scars in general many-body Hamiltonians remains an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce ScarFinder, a variational framework that reveals possible scar-like dynamics without prior knowledge of scar states or their algebraic structure. By iteratively evolving and projecting states within a low-entanglement variational manifold, ScarFinder isolates scarred trajectories by suppressing thermal contributions. We validate the method on the analytically tractable spin-1 XY model, recovering the known scar dynamics, as well as the mixed field Ising model, where we capture and generalize the initial conditions previously associated with ``weak thermalization''. We then apply the method to the PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, efficiently characterizing its mixed phase space and finding a previously unknown trajectory with nearly-perfect revival dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our results establish ScarFinder as a powerful, model-agnostic tool for identifying and optimizing coherent dynamics in quantum many-body systems.

Title: Spatially-Controlled Planar Guided Crystallization of Low-Loss Phase Change Materials for Programmable Photonics

Abstract: Photonic integrated devices are progressively evolving beyond passive components into fully programmable systems, notably driven by the progress in chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) for non-volatile reconfigurable nanophotonics. However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, we propose the concept of spatially-controlled planar guided crystallization, a novel method for programming the growth of optically homogeneous low-loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM-based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non-volatile optical phase-shifter exploiting a silicon nitride-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure optically uniform crystalline properties across devices is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non-volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits.

Title: On entanglement c-functions in confining gauge field theories
Authors: Niko Jokela, Jani Kastikainen, Carlos Nunez, José Manuel Penín, Helime Ruotsalainen, Javier G. Subils
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has proven to be a powerful tool for probing renormalization group (RG) flows in quantum field theories, with c-functions derived from it serving as candidate measures of the effective number of degrees of freedom. While the monotonicity of such c-functions is well established in many settings, notable exceptions occur in theories with a mass scale. In this work, we investigate entanglement c-functions in the context of holographic RG flows, with a particular focus on flows across dimensions induced by circle compactifications. We argue that in spacetime dimensions $d \geq 4$, standard constructions of c-functions, which rely on higher derivatives of the entanglement entropy of either a ball or a cylinder, generically lead to non-monotonic behavior. Working with known dual geometries, we argue that the non-monotonicity stems not from any pathology or curvature singularity, but from a transition in the holographic Ryu--Takayanagi surface. In compactifications from four to three dimensions, we propose a modified construction that restores monotonicity in the infrared, although a fully monotonic ultraviolet extension remains elusive. Furthermore, motivated by entanglement entropy inequalities, we conjecture a bound on the cylinder entanglement c-function, which holds in all our examples.

Title: Quantum Mpemba effect without global symmetries
Authors: Tanmay Bhore, Lei Su, Ivar Martin, Aashish A. Clerk, Zlatko Papić
Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a system initially farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than one closer to equilibrium, has been extensively studied in classical systems and recently explored in quantum settings. While previous studies of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) have largely focused on isolated systems with global symmetries, we argue that the QME is ubiquitous in generic, non-integrable many-body systems lacking such symmetries, including U(1) charge conservation, spatial symmetries, and even energy conservation. Using paradigmatic models such as the quantum Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields, we show that the QME can be understood through the energy density of initial states and their inverse participation ratio in the energy eigenbasis. Our findings provide a unified framework for the QME, linking it with classical thermal relaxation.

Title: Lieb's Theorem for Bose Hubbard Models
Authors: Zhong-Chao Wei, Chong Zhao
Abstract: Using a cone-theoretical method, we prove the uniqueness of the ground state for two Bose Hubbard models. The first model is the usual Bose Hubbard model with real hopping coefficients and attractive interactions. The second model is a two-component Bose Hubbard model. Under certain conditions, we show that the ground state in the subspace with particle number $N=2n$($n$ is a positive integer) is unique for both models. For the second model, we show that the ground state has spin along the z-axis $S^{z}=0$. When the hopping coefficients are real, it has zero spin quantum number, i.e., it is a singlet. Our proofs work equally well for any arbitrary finite-size lattice.

Title: Efficient implementation of quantum signal processing via the adiabatic-impulse model
Authors: D.O. Shendryk, O.V. Ivakhnenko, S.N. Shevchenko, Franco Nori
Abstract: Here we investigate analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.

Title: Insights into Ionic Diffusion in C-S-H Gel Pore from Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Spatial Distributions, Energy Barriers, and Structural Descriptor
Authors: Weiqiang Chen, Kai Gong
Abstract: Understanding transport behavior in nanoconfined environments is critical to many natural and engineering systems, including cementitious materials, yet its molecular-level mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate Na, Cl, and water diffusion inside a 4 nm calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) pore channel over temperatures ranging from 300 K to 360 K. Spatially resolved analysis revealed strong suppression of diffusivity near the solid-liquid interface and gradual recovery toward the pore center. Arrhenius analysis further quantified the spatial variation of activation energy barriers and intrinsic mobilities across the pore channel, showing distinct confinement effects. The spatially resolved structural analysis uncovers a mechanistic transition from structure-controlled to hydrodynamics-controlled transport regimes with increasing distance from the pore surface. A structural descriptor, total coordination strength (TCS), was introduced, providing a predictive link between local liquid structure and molecular mobility within approximately 1 nm of the interface. Beyond approximately 1 nm, suppressed diffusivities were well captured by an empirical model inspired by the Darcy-Brinkman framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MD study to comprehensively resolve the spatial heterogeneity of transport, thermal kinetics, and structure within cementitious nanopores. These findings deepen the fundamental understanding of nanoscale transport phenomena and suggest that tailoring the nanochannel structure and interfacial chemistry of cementitious gels, for example surface coordination environments, pore size distributions, and adsorption sites, may offer a promising strategy to suppress ionic ingress and enhance the durability of cement-based materials.

Title: Mixed five-point correlators in the 3d Ising model
Authors: David Poland, Valentina Prilepina, Petar Tadić
Abstract: We study five-point correlators of the $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, and $\epsilon'$ operators in the critical 3d Ising model. We consider the $\sigma \times \sigma$ and $\sigma \times \epsilon$ operator product expansions (OPEs) and truncate them by including a finite set of exchanged operators. We approximate the truncated operators by the corresponding contributions in appropriate disconnected five-point correlators. We compute a number of OPE coefficients that were previously unknown and show that these are consistent with predictions obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization of the critical 3d Ising model.

Title: Fully quantum perturbative description of correlated Stokes--anti-Stokes scattering
Authors: Raul Corrêa, Marcelo F. Santos, Carlos H. Monken, Ado Jorio
Abstract: The process in which Raman scattering produces correlated Stokes and anti-Stokes radiation is known as Stokes--anti-Stokes (SaS) scattering. It has been shown recently that this process can generate entangled photon pairs, making it a promising tool for quantum optical technologies, but a proper quantum theoretical description was lacking. In this paper, a fully quantum derivation of the electric polarization in a medium with vibrational Raman response, with quantized electromagnetic fields, is developed. Using quantum perturbation theory for Heisenberg operators, we find the solution for the material electric polarization and show that a four-wave mixing-like correlated SaS scattering appears in the first order of perturbation and completely characterizes the non-resonant SaS photon pair production. We also discuss how to construct the third-order non-linear optical susceptibility for the SaS scattering from the quantum formalism, and show that it coincides with the one derived for classical fields in stimulated Raman.

Title: Effective 2D Envelope Function Theory for Silicon Quantum Dots
Authors: Christian W. Binder, Guido Burkard, Andrew J. Fisher
Abstract: We present a rigorous method to reduce the three-dimensional (3D) description of a quantum dot in silicon to an effective two-dimensional (2D) envelope function theory for electron spin qubits. By systematically integrating out the strongly confined vertical dimension using a Born-Oppenheimer-inspired ansatz at the envelope-function level, we derive an effective in-plane potential that faithfully captures the essential electrostatics of the full 3D system. Considering the lowest two eigenstates of the out-of-plane direction, this reduction leads to the natural and explicit emergence of the valley degree of freedom within a 2D formalism, which is derived here from first principles. We validate the accuracy of the method through comparisons with full 3D simulations and demonstrate its superiority over naive 2D slicing, particularly in the presence of interface roughness. Crucially, the reduction in dimensionality leads to substantial computational savings, making our approach particularly well suited for simulating two-electron systems, e.g., for the extraction of parameters such as the exchange coupling. Beyond its practical utility, the rigorous 2D envelope function theory that is introduced in this study incorporates valley physics in a physically grounded manner, offering conceptual clarity on the role of valley states in qubit operation and measurement.

Title: Dynamic syndrome decoder in volume-law phases of hybrid quantum circuits
Authors: Dawid Paszko, Marcin Szyniszewski, Arijeet Pal
Abstract: Phases of matter with volume-law entanglement are frequently observed in quantum circuits and have numerous applications, ranging from deepening our understanding of quantum mechanics to advancements in quantum computing and cryptography. Their capacity to host entangled, complex quantum information is complemented by their ability to efficiently obscure it from quantum measurements through scrambling, reminiscent of quantum error-correction. However, the issue of initial-state decodability has primarily been studied in measurement-only models with area-law phases, which limit the entanglement of the encoded state. In this work, we introduce a class of Clifford circuits in one and two dimensions that feature a decodable volume law phase, allowing for information retrieval in logarithmic circuit depths. We present the Sign-Color Decoder that tracks stabilizers revealing the initial state, akin to monitoring a dynamically-changing syndrome for error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this approach in scenarios where error locations are either known or unknown to the decoder, and we provide new insights about the relationship between the decodability transition and measurement-induced phase transition. We propose that this decodability transition is universal across various settings, including different circuit geometries. Our findings pave the way for using volume law states as encoders with mid-circuit measurements, opening potential applications in quantum error correction and quantum cryptography.

Title: High-harmonic spectroscopy of mobility edges in one-dimensional quasicrystals
Authors: H. K. Avetissian, B. R. Avchyan, A. Brown, G. F. Mkrtchian
Abstract: Quasicrystals occupy a unique position between periodic and disordered systems, where localization phenomena such as Anderson transitions and mobility edges can emerge even in the absence of disorder. This distinctive behavior motivates the development of robust, all-optical diagnostic tools capable of probing the structural, topological, and dynamical properties of such systems. In this work, focusing on generalized Aubry-André-Harper models and on an incommensurate potential in the continuum limit, we demonstrate that high-harmonic generation phenomenon serves as a powerful probe of localization transitions and mobility edges in quasicrystals. We introduce a new parameter--dipole mobility--which captures the impact of intraband dipole transitions and enables classification of nonlinear optical regimes, where excitation and high-harmonic generation yield can differ by orders of magnitude. We show that the cutoff frequency of harmonics is strongly influenced by the position of the mobility edge, providing a robust and experimentally accessible signature of localization transitions in quasicrystals.

Title: Enhancement of Weak Interactions in Phase Transitions
Authors: V. V. Flambaum
Abstract: Weak interactions cause small parity-violating energy differences between left- and right-handed chiral systems. Although normally tiny, these effects may be significantly enhanced during collective phenomena such as phase transitions. We propose a theoretical model describing the enhancement of weak interactions in phase transitions. The enhancement factor is proportional to the critical number of atoms, $N_c$, in the nucleus of the new phase. After the nucleus reaches its critical size, it grows until it fills the entire system. Measurement of the ratio of produced left and right chiral structures may provide a way to measure this critical number $N_c$. Experiments where definite spin-chiral structures are formed during a phase transition in crossed electric and magnetic fields, indicate $N_c \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$. An open question is whether a similar enhancement could operate during cosmological phase transitions - thereby boosting CP-violating effects sufficiently to contribute to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry (baryogenesis).

Title: Systematic Study of Amorphous ABC Heterostructures at the Atomic Scale as a Nonlinear Optical Metamaterial
Authors: Martin Mičulka, Jinsong Liu, Sebastian Beer, Raihan Rafi, Denys Sevriukov, Sergiy Yulin, Vladimir Roddatis, Stefan Nolte, Isabelle Staude, Andreas Tünnermann, Sven Schröder, Adriana Szeghalmi
Abstract: The systematic exploration of ABC type heterostructures reveals that nanoscale morphological modification markedly improves nonlinear optical properties to maximize the artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures are fabricated through cyclic plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking centrosymmetry. We observe a dependence of optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials: SiO$_2$ (A), TiO$_2$ (B), and Al$_2$O$_3$ (C), ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these materials exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz}\nobreakspace{}=\nobreakspace{}2.0\nobreakspace{}\pm\nobreakspace{}0.2$ pm/V is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.
