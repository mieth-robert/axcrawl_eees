Title: On the problem of simple shear of an incompressible viscoelastic solid under finite deformations
Authors: Vladislav V. Kozhukhov
Abstract: In the framework of a viscoelastic material model, whose constitutive relation is given by a one-parameter family of Gordon-Schowalter derivatives, the problem of simple shear under acceleration and random velocity motion is considered. For motion with acceleration, the presence of non-zero normal stresses is discovered, which corresponds to the Poynting effect previously discovered for this material. A problem in which the shear rate was determined as a linear function of a random variable given from a normal distribution was studied. Within the framework of the methodology proposed by V.A. Lomakin, an analytical solution of the problem is constructed. A significant dependence of the dispersion of the stress tensor components on the choice of the objective derivative was found.

Title: An exact dimension-reduced dynamic theory for developable surfaces and curve-fold origami
Authors: Zhixuan Wen, Sheng Mao, Huiling Duan, Fan Feng
Abstract: Curve-fold origami, composed of developable panels joined along a curved crease, exhibits rich dynamic behaviors relevant to metamaterials and soft robotic systems. Despite multiple approximated models, a comprehensive and exact dynamical theory for curve-fold origami remains absent, limiting the precise predictions of its dynamics, especially for those with wide panels. In this work, we develop an exact dimension-reduced theory that focuses on the dynamics of curve-fold origami, utilizing the intrinsic one-dimensional nature of developable surfaces. Starting from a single developable surface, we investigate the kinematics and kinetic energy of a moving developable surface. By overcoming the difficulty of describing the motion of local frames, we derive the exact velocity field of wide surfaces solely described by the motion of the reference curve, which leads to the kinetic energy of the entire surface. Owing to the one-dimensional feature, the Lagrangian of the system, composed of both kinetic and elastic energy, is a functional of the reference curve. Thus, we may variate the Lagrangian and derive a nonlinear dynamical theory for the reference curve, which comprises governing equations similar to the rod model but can precisely describe the motion of developable surfaces. The theory is validated consistently in both Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks and is further extended to curved-fold origami modeled as a coupled bi-rod system. Utilizing our exact 1D model, we theoretically analyze the dynamical behaviors of various developable structures, revealing that the coupling of curvature and torsion along with the motion of local frames in our theory leads to the accurate modeling of arbitrarily deformed developable surfaces, which are validated by finite element analysis quantitatively.

Title: Onsager's Real Cavity model near solid interfaces
Authors: Johannes Fiedler, Drew F. Parsons
Abstract: We develop an extended Onsager real-cavity framework to describe the Casimir-Polder interaction of small molecules dissolved in dielectric liquids near planar interfaces. By analytically resolving the geometry of the cavity opening, we derive a closed expression that arises when the molecule approaches a surface and connects them smoothly to the asymptotic medium-assisted interaction. Using experimentally established dielectric functions for water, propanol, and PTFE together with accurate molecular polarisabilities for O2 and N2, we compute the full distance-dependent potential for four molecule (O2 and N2)-liquid (water and propanol)-surface (PTFE) combinations. The results reveal how local-field screening inside the cavity, molecular polarisability, and liquid permittivity jointly determine the magnitude and shape of the interaction, including the characteristic transition from the open cavity (small separations) and closed cavity (large separations). The framework provides a transparent baseline for dispersion forces in liquids, while highlighting limitations associated with the point-dipole description, the absence of repulsive contributions, and the breakdown of the dipole approximation at ultrashort separations.

Title: Composition-agnostic prediction of self-assembly in multicomponent amphiphile mixtures from molecular structure
Authors: Yuuki Ishiwatari, Takahiro Yokoyama, Tomoya Kojima, Taisuke Banno, Noriyoshi Arai
Abstract: Predicting self-assembly in multi-component amphiphilic systems is challenging due to the complexity of intercomponent interactions and the combinatorial growth of possible formulations. In this study, we develop a unified machine-learning framework that directly predicts self-assembly behavior from the molecular structures of constituent components, independent of the number or identity of those components. We extend the critical packing parameter (CPP) to multi-component systems and generate a large dataset of self-assembled morphologies using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations. By systematically evaluating twelve combinations of feature extraction methods and model architectures, we find that models incorporating a fully connected graph convolutional network (GCN) layer achieve superior performance, with the GCN-GCN architecture accurately capturing both intramolecular relationships and intercomponent interactions. Notably, this model exhibits strong extrapolative capability: it accurately predicts CPP values for five-component mixtures even when trained only on systems with fewer components, and it maintains high accuracy for mixtures composed of molecular species that are entirely absent from the training data. These results demonstrate that a composition-agnostic predictive framework can enable efficient virtual screening and provide a foundation for the rational design of complex amphiphilic materials.

Title: On the chemo-thermo-mechanics of constrained reactive mixtures of solids
Authors: Alberto Salvadori, Mattia Serpelloni, Robert M. McMeeking
Abstract: Building upon the classical chemo-mechanical theory of Larch{é} and Cahn for equilibrium, numerous studies have investigated the transport of species in solids, with or without trapping phenomena. In most applications -- such as the swelling of hydrogels, hydrogen embrittlement in metals, and the transport of lithium or sodium in battery electrodes -- the formation of a new phase or compound can be directly associated with the concentration of the diffusing species. In the present work, we focus on the formation of solid mixtures made of multiple compounds, each characterized by its own volumetric expansion coefficient. Such a scenario arises, for instance, during the sodiation of tin anodes, among other systems. The classical chemo-mechanical framework is naturally recovered as a particular case of the proposed formulation. The theoretical framework developed herein elucidates and differentiates the concepts of phases and flowing species, while establishing rigorous connections between them. The present note is restricted to the general formulation of the governing equations, whereas application-specific developments will be addressed in forthcoming publications.

Title: The extraordinary importance of self-avoiding behavior in two-dimensional polymers: Insights from large-deviation theory
Authors: Eleftherios Mainas, Jan Tobochnik, Richard Stratt
Abstract: Some recent work pointed out the usefulness of taking a large-deviation perspective when trying to extract anything resembling a macroscopic order parameter from a computer simulation. In this paper we note that the end-to-end distance of polymers is such an order parameter. The presence of long-ranged excluded volume interactions leads to significant qualitative differences between the conformations of two- and three-dimensional polymers, some of which are difficult to quantify in computer simulations of realistic (off-lattice) polymer models. But we show here that phenomena such as the greatly enlarged non-Hooke's-law elasticity present in 2D are straightforward to extract from simulation using a large-deviation framework - even though simulating that nonlinearity is tantamount to simulating a 4th order susceptibility. The large-deviation perspective includes both a set of thermodynamic-like tools suitable for studying finite-size systems and a realization that an accurate description of the system's average behavior needs to be consistent with how improbably large fluctuations would behave in that system. The latter is key because strong correlations are absent in this asymptotic large fluctuation regime, so the regime's far-reaching effects can be analytically incorporated into the analysis of simulation data. That, in turn, allows us to direct the efforts of simulations away from difficult-to-sample rare-event domains. We illustrate this point with two- and three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations (and exact results) on two models of a single isolated polymer chain: a chain of linked hard spheres, which has long-ranged excluded volume effects, and a discretized worm-like chain, which does not.

Title: The mechanics of anisotropic active plates with applications to cell alignment on curved substrates
Authors: Gabriele Fioretto, Giulio Lucci, Chiara Giverso, Luigi Preziosi
Abstract: We develop a general continuum mechanics framework for active anisotropic plates within the Föppl-von Kármán limit, incorporating a preferential direction and inelastic active contractions in geometrically nonlinear plate theory. Through asymptotic expansion, we derive coupled equilibrium equations for plates with transversely isotropic and possibly inhomogeneous reinforcement undergoing spatially varying active contractions through their thickness. The framework highlights the coupling between material anisotropy and active deformations, with target curvatures that compete with imposed geometric constraints. To demonstrate its capabilities, we apply the model to curvature-induced cell alignment, where substrate geometry, cytoskeletal anisotropy, and contractility interact to determine orientation. For cylindrical substrates, the model predicts a supercritical bifurcation in preferred orientation, from perpendicular to parallel, through an oblique orientation governed by the ratio of active contractility to substrate curvature and modulated by material stiffness. For ellipsoidal geometries, we capture stable parallel, perpendicular, and oblique configurations depending on principal curvatures, whereas spherical substrates do not show preferred alignments. These predictions qualitatively reproduce experimental observations across cell types, explaining divergent behaviors between contractile epithelial cells and stiffer fibroblasts in a rigorous context. Beyond cellular mechanics, this framework applies broadly to thin fiber-reinforced active structures in soft robotics, morphogenesis, and tissue engineering.

Title: LiquiFab -- Building with liquids in weightlessness
Authors: Erez Hochman, Aaron Sprecher, Kateryna Suzina, Amir Mann, Yuval Mihalovich, Valeri Frumkin, Moran Bercovici
Abstract: Existing digital manufacturing methods can be broadly divided into subtractive approaches, where material is removed from a bulk to reveal the desired form, and additive methods, in which material is introduced voxel-by-voxel to create an object. We here show a fundamentally different method for the fabrication of three-dimensional objects that is neither subtractive nor additive. Instead of removal or layer-by-layer material deposition, in LiquiFab we shape an entire volume of liquid polymer by subjecting it to a set of geometrical constraints under conditions of weightlessness. The physics of liquid interfaces then drives the polymer to naturally adopt a configuration that minimizes its surface energy. On Earth, we achieve weightlessness through neutral buoyancy, and show that a small, well-defined set of boundary surfaces can be used to drive the liquid into a desired form that is then solidified. By sequentially applying this process, complex architectures can be assembled from successive liquid-formed elements. Unlike additive manufacturing, where every point within the object must be individually visited by a print head or light field, LiquiFab forms the entire structure simultaneously. This makes the process highly scalable and opens the door to rapid manufacturing of large objects both on Earth and in space.

Title: Micromagnet-free operation of electron spin qubits in Si/Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ vertical double quantum dots
Authors: Abhikbrata Sarkar, Daniel Loss
Abstract: We study a vertical double quantum dot (DQD) in a Si/Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$/Si double-well heterostructure for full electrical control of electron Loss-DiVincenzo (LD) spin qubits, using realistic device modeling and numerical simulations. Due to the emerging spin-orbit interaction in the DQD, as well as strain from the gate electrodes, small (percentage range) but finite $g$ tensor variations emerge. In addition, we find a large valley splitting, on the order of $E_v{\sim}250\,\mu$eV. As a result, multiple avenues for fast electrical single qubit rotations emerge. An ac electric field gives rise to electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR), while electron spin resonance (ESR) in the presence of an ac magnetic field can be electrically controlled by local gates due to varying $g$ factors in DQDs. We also show that shuttling between neighboring dots, in vertical and horizontal direction, results in ultrafast single qubit gates of less than a nanosecond. Remarkably, this DQD architecture completely eliminates the need for micromagnets, significantly facilitating the scalability of LD spin qubits in semiconductor foundries.

Title: Geometry-Enforced Topological Chiral Fermions in Amorphous Chiral Metals
Authors: Justin Schirmann, Adolfo G. Grushin, Benjamin J. Wieder
Abstract: Since the prediction and observation of topological Weyl semimetals (chiral TSMs), there have been enormous efforts to characterize further condensed matter realizations of chiral fermions. These efforts were dramatically accelerated by the subsequent discovery of a profound link between low-energy topological and lattice chirality in structurally chiral crystals. Though TSMs are well understood in the limit of perfect translation symmetry, real solid-state materials host defects and disorder, and may even be rendered amorphous down to all but the smallest system length scales. Previous theoretical studies have concluded that chiral TSMs transition into trivial diffusive metals at moderate disorder scales, raising concerns that chiral TSM states may only be accessible in highly crystalline samples. In this work, we in contrast identify large families of chiral TSMs that persist under strong structural disorder - even into the amorphous regime. We show that amorphous chiral TSM phases can in particular be stabilized by the presence of long-range order in the local structural chirality. We present extensive analytic and numerical calculations demonstrating the existence of both Weyl and higher-charge chiral fermions in amorphous metals whose topology and spin and orbital angular momentum textures are tunable via the interplay of average symmetry and geometry. To distinguish and generate new realizations of strongly disordered chiral fermions, we introduce an analytic approach grounded in symmetry group theory. We then introduce an amorphous Wilson loop numerical method to characterize chiral fermions with quantized Berry curvature fluxes in metals with 3D structural disorder. Our findings bridge the crystalline and strongly disordered regimes of chiral TSMs, and indicate a clear route towards engineering geometry-enforced topology in non-crystalline materials and metamaterials.

Title: All-to-All interactions via multifractal wavefunction geometry
Authors: YouYoung Joung, Jemin Park, SungBin Lee
Abstract: We uncover a generic mechanism through which the intrinsic geometry of multifractal quantum wavefunctions generates effective all-to-all interactions in many-body systems. By analyzing the multifractal spectrum, we demonstrate that the simultaneous participation of widely separated length scales creates a global connectivity that bypasses local interaction constraints. This nonlocality leads to fast information scrambling, evidenced by sharp changes in the quenched dynamics of the quantum Fisher information and bipartite mutual information with the onset of negative tripartite mutual information. Such rapid scrambling is a defining feature of strongly chaotic quantum dynamics, and our results identify the systems with multifractal states as a promising solid-state platform for realizing this regime. More broadly, they reveal a new paradigm in which complex, multiscale wavefunction structure intrinsically generates long-range connectivity, providing a natural route to achieving nonlocal behavior in strongly correlated quantum materials.

Title: Quantum Phases of a Strongly Disordered Two-Legged Josephson Ladder
Authors: Eyal Walach, Efrat Shimshoni
Abstract: Disordered superconductors in low dimensions provide an exemplary manifestation for the role of quantum fluctuations in a many-body system. Specifically in Josephson arrays with comparable Josephson and charging energies ($E_J\sim E_C$), disorder tends to change the nature of the paradigmatic Superconductor-Insulator Transition (SIT) and potentially leads to formation of multiple distinct phases. We address this problem in a model of a two-legged Josephson ladder subjected to a wide spatial distribution of its parameters along the legs. In contrast, we assume the system to have a perfect $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry to interchange between the legs, and investigate the effects of spatial randomness which preserves this symmetry in the strong-disorder limit. To this end, we apply a strong randomness real-space renormalization group technique and explore the resulting phase diagram. We identify three disorder-dominated phases, including an intermediate phase between a disordered superconductor and a disordered insulator. The latter insulating phase can be mapped to a XY spin-chain in a spin glass phase, while the intermediate phase turns out to be a Bose glass.

Title: Preparation of a Quantum Spin Liquid in Non-Hermitian Quantum Dimer Models and Rydberg Arrays
Authors: Shashwat Chakraborty, Taylor L. Hughes
Abstract: We identify an unconventional form of the non-Hermitian skin effect that occurs not in position space but in many-body Fock space, which we call the Fock space skin effect (FSSE). Using quantum dimer models, we characterize FSSE analytically and numerically, and propose a concrete route toward its realization in Rydberg atom arrays. The dimer constraint is enforced through Rydberg gadgets employing the blockade mechanism, while directional reservoirs generate non-Hermitian flipping amplitudes. We show that FSSE enables the preparation of gapped spin liquid states, and in particular, we demonstrate how a Rydberg geometry realizing a square lattice quantum dimer model with next-nearest neighbor dimers can be driven by non-Hermiticity into an exact spin liquid ground state. Our results establish Fock-space non-Hermiticity as a powerful principle for engineering exotic quantum phases and dynamical state-preparation protocols.

Title: Spin Glasses: Disorder, Frustration, and Nonequilibrium Complexity
Authors: Naeimeh Tahriri, Vahid Mahdikhah, Jahanfar Abouie, Daryoosh Vashaee
Abstract: Spin glasses occupy a unique place in condensed matter: they freeze collectively while remaining struc-turally disordered, and they exhibit slow, history-dependent dynamics that reflect an exceptionally rug-ged free-energy landscape. This review provides an integrated account of spin-glass physics, emphasiz-ing how microscopic ingredients (quenched randomness, frustration, competing exchange interactions, and random fields) conspire to produce macroscopic glassiness. We begin with the canonical Edwards-Anderson and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick formulations to introduce the central theoretical ideas that recur across the literature: extensive degeneracy, metastability, and the emergence of long relaxation times that manifest as aging, memory, and rejuvenation under standard experimental protocols. We then summarize the principal routes used to characterize spin-glass freezing, combining thermodynamic signatures with dynamical probes that reveal the separation of timescales and the sensitivity to thermal and magnetic histories. Building on these foundations, we draw connections across experimental material classes (me-tallic alloys, insulating oxides, and geometrically frustrated systems) by emphasizing how intrinsic ver-sus induced disorder and competing interaction networks shape the observed phenomenology. Recent advances in reentrant and room-temperature spin-glass materials are highlighted as a rapidly developing direction that tests the limits of established paradigms and motivates new materials-driven questions. The review concludes by connecting modern computational developments, including machine-learning phase identification and neural-network analogies, to longstanding challenges in classification, univer-sality, and out-of-equilibrium behavior, and by outlining emerging opportunities at the boundary between classical and quantum spin glasses.

Title: Bosonization solution of the Kondo lattice in a Luttinger liquid
Authors: Tomás Bortolin, C. J. Bolech, Nayana Shah, Aníbal Iucci
Abstract: We address the physics of a regular arrangement of independent magnetic impurities embedded in a band of interacting electrons. We focus on the one-dimensional case that can be studied using bosonization and in which the electron bulk is described by a Luttinger liquid. The impurity spins interact with the electrons via magnetic exchange that introduces the possibility of Kondo and RKKY physics. We find that for two special values of the interactions, the model can be refermionized as a non-interacting electron band hybridized with a regular array of resonant levels. These solvable limits provide access to impurity correlators that correspond to either extended algebraic order or local screening. A physical picture emerges of how the interelectron interactions can stabilize either Kondo or RKKY physics depending on the sign of the interaction.

Title: On the Role of Internal Degrees of Freedom in Structural Relaxation of Ring-Tail Structured Liquids Across Temperature Regimes
Authors: Rolf Zeißler, Sandra Krüger, Robin Horstmann, Till Böhmer, Michael Vogel, Thomas Blochowicz
Abstract: We investigate how anisotropic molecular rotation and internal molecular flexibility influence liquid dynamics in 1-phenylalkanes. To this end, we combine depolarized dynamic light scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that anisotropic rotations and internal molecular flexibility substantially contribute to structural relaxation in the liquid state. However, their influence diminishes on entering the supercooled-liquid regime, where the relaxation behavior develops towards the previously identified generic relaxation shape, likely due to the increasing cooperativity of rotational dynamics. Because 1-phenylalkanes are simple model systems with similarities to many other molecular liquids, this study suggests that effects of anisotropic rotation and internal flexibility are relevant in various liquids with similar molecular complexity, and provides a proof of concept for how these effects can be identified.

Title: Dynamics of self-organization in dense persistent active matter
Authors: Atharva Shukla, Chandan Dasgupta
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional athermal binary mixture of Lennard-Jones particles with persistent random active forces. The liquid phase of this system for active forces exceeding a threshold value exhibits self-organization with long-range spatial correlations of particle velocities and active forces. We study by simulations the development of these correlations from a random initial state. Several characteristics of the growth of correlations are measured and compared with those of phase-ordering kinetics of equilibrium systems after a quench from a disordered state. The motion of the particles in the long-time steady state is found to be dominated by two streams that flow in opposite directions.

Title: A Unified Thermo-Chemo-Mechanical Framework for Bulk and Frontal Polymerization: Coupled Kinetics and Front Stability
Authors: Xuanhe Li, Tal Cohen
Abstract: Polymerization is a fundamental chemical process enabling large-scale production of material components across modern industries. By transforming a monomer mixture into a cross-linked polymer network, polymerization induces changes in temperature and material properties such as density and stiffness, which can generate residual stress and warping through coupled mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. Depending on processing conditions, polymerization may occur either in the bulk, sustained by continuous external energy input, or as a self-sustaining exothermic reaction front, commonly referred to as frontal polymerization. While frontal polymerization offers rapid and energy-efficient curing, its localized reaction zone produces sharp spatial gradients that amplify thermo-chemo-mechanical coupling effects. In this work, we develop a thermodynamically consistent framework that captures both bulk and frontal polymerization, incorporating stress-dependent reaction kinetics and the evolution of the stress-free configuration during curing. Using a narrow reaction-zone approximation in a uniaxial setting, we derive analytical predictions for propagation velocity, residual stress development, and stability. A perturbation analysis yields a stability criterion that generalizes the classical Zeldovich number by accounting for heat loss and mechanical loading, and enables construction of a phase diagram distinguishing stable, unstable, and quenched propagation regimes.

Title: A ruled narrow elastic strip model with corrected energy
Authors: E. Vitral, J. A. Hanna, L. Koens
Abstract: We present a new one-dimensional model for elastic strips based on a nondevelopable ruled surface. An auxiliary field regularizes the Sadowsky narrow-strip model to allow nonzero twist with vanishing curvature. The energy exhibits the scalings derived by Freddi and co-workers, and for a certain choice of parameter, convexifies the Sadowsky energy without patching. We present the kinematics and energetics of the model, and employ a variational approach featuring a rotation tensor to derive equilibrium equations. We perform a regular perturbation expansion to study the model behavior close to inflection points. When the energy is convex, curvature and moment are continuous at inflection points, while the auxiliary function suffers a jump, leading to a discontinuity in the ruled embedding for any finite width.

Title: Semi-automated estimation of hydrogenic initial states for localized Wannier functions
Authors: Tatsuki Oikawa, Kota Ido, Takahiro Misawa, Takashi Koretsune, Kazuyoshi Yoshimi
Abstract: We present a semi-automated method for obtaining an initial estimate of Wannier functions, designed to facilitate the construction of Wannier functions for describing low-energy effective models of solids, particularly those relevant to strongly correlated electron systems. Our approach automatically determines the hydrogenic projections orbitals and the center of the Wannier functions from information on Bloch wavefunctions at the $\Gamma$ point. This method is integrated into cif2qewan, enabling seamless generation of input files for Quantum ESPRESSO and Wannier90. We validate our method through applications to both inorganic and organic compounds, such as Si, SrVO$_3$, FeSe, Na$_8$Al$_6$Si$_6$O$_{24}$, and (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$. The obtained results demonstrate that our semi-automated projections give a good initial estimate of the Wannier functions. We also show the comparisons with other methods for estimating the initial states of the Wannier functions, such as the Selected Columns of the Density Matrix (SCDM). Our methodology shows an efficient way to construct Wannier functions, paving the way for high-throughput calculations in the study of complex materials.

Title: Metastability and high-Tc superconductivity in A15-type ternary hydride YSbH6 at moderate pressure
Authors: Maélie Caussé, Kieran Bozier, Peter I. C. Cooke, Stefano Racioppi, Chris J. Pickard
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductors remains a central challenge in materials science. Hydrogen-rich compounds are among the most promising candidates, as they can exhibit phonon-mediated superconductivity at elevated critical temperatures, though their stabilization typically requires extreme pressures. % Here, we report the identification of YSbH$_{6}$ as a promising superconductor by a multi-stage high-throughput screening on ternary A15-type hydrides, followed by a high-throughput computational search of the Y--Sb--H system, accelerated by ephemeral data derived potentials. % The cubic $Pm\Bar{3}$ YSbH$_{6}$ phase exhibits a predicted critical temperature of 118\,K at 50\,GPa, among the highest $T_{\rm c}$ reported to date for an A15-hydride at this pressure. Thermodynamic analysis shows that YSbH$_{6}$ lies $\sim$100\,meV/atom above the convex hull at 50\,GPa, but only 26\,meV/atom above the hull at 120\,GPa, suggesting possible metastability and synthesis at similar high pressure conditions. The phase is dynamically stable over a wide pressure range (20--120\,GPa), displays kinetic stability at 50\,GPa and elastic stability at 20 and 50\,GPa, key ingredients for long-lived metastable behaviour at moderate pressures. % These results highlight YSbH$_{6}$ as a benchmark case illustrating the balance between high-$T_{\rm c}$ performance and limited thermodynamic stability in ternary hydrides, and underscore the importance of combined dynamic, thermodynamic, kinetic and elastic stability analyses for guiding experimental synthesis of metastable superconductors.

Title: Three-dimensional atom-by-atom mapping of nanoscale precipitates in single Te inclusions in Cd0.9Zn0.1Te crystal
Authors: Eloïse Rahier, Sebastian Koelling, Guillaume Nadal, Sudarshan Singh, Luc Montpetit, Oussama Moutanabbir
Abstract: The complexity and richness of phenomena governing alloy crystal growth can be unraveled by examining the three-dimensional atomic-level distribution of elements and impurities incorporated during growth. These species act as atomic fingerprints, revealing the thermodynamic constraints that shape material structure and composition. Herein, we combine transmission electron microscopy and atom probe of tellurium (Te) inclusions within cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) single crystals. The correlative analysis uncovers nanoscale precipitates embedded within Te inclusions, consisting of CZT nanocrystals with a Zn content of 1.5 at.%. Surrounding these precipitates, an around 10 nm-thick shell is observed, enriched with copper and indium impurities. In addition, traces of sodium and sulfur are detected within the nanocrystals. These findings provide direct evidence of the complex segregation and precipitation processes occurring during CZT crystal growth, reflecting the interplay of thermodynamic driving forces and kinetic constraints that govern solute redistribution. The resulting insights contribute to a deeper understanding of impurity behavior and phase separation mechanisms in CZT alloys. This work establishes a framework for modeling and optimization of growth strategies of higher-quality CZT crystals for next-generation infrared and radiation detection technologies.

Title: Topological character of the antiferromagnetic EuMg$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$
Authors: Mazharul Islam Mondal, Issam Mahraj, Milo Sprague, Sabin Regmi, Xiaxin Ding, Firoza Kabir, Himanshu Sheokand, Krzysztof Gofryk, Dariusz Kaczorowski, Andrzej Ptok, Madhab Neupane
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic EuM$_{2}$Pn$_{2}$ compounds, where M is a metal element and Pn is a pnictogen element, have been recognized as candidates for realizing a topologically nontrivial electronic structure. In this paper, we focus on EuMg$_2$Bi$_2$, whose topological nature still remains unclear. We present a comprehensive study based on several experimental and theoretical techniques. Magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and specific heat capacity measurements confirm the existence of an antiferromagnetic ordering. The electronic band structure was investigated by high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), supported by ab initio calculations. ARPES measurement reveals that the electronic structure of this system is dominated by linearly dispersive hole-like bands near the Fermi level. Theoretical analyses of the electronic band structure indicates that EuMg$_2$Bi$_2$ is a strong topological insulator, which should be reflected in the presence of a metallic surface state. We also theoretically examine the magnetic-field-induced anomalous Hall conductivity, confirming previously reported observations.

Title: Anisotropic electron-phonon coupling and chiral phonons in van der Waals room temperature ferromagnet Fe$_{5}$GeTe$_{2}$
Authors: Smrutiranjan Mekap, Andrzej Ptok, Jyoti Saini, Changgu Lee, Subhasis Ghosh, Anushree Roy
Abstract: The layered van der Waals Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ (F5GT) compound exhibits room-temperature ferromagnetism, making it a promising candidate for technological applications. In our study, combined temperature- and polarization-dependent Raman measurements, along with modern {\it ab initio} calculations, reveal important aspects of the lattice dynamics. The angle dependence of Raman intensity under linear polarization configuration exhibits a strong tilt in the laboratory coordinate, indicating the existence of anisotropic electron-phonon coupling. The electron-phonon coupling was also examined via the Fano parameter of the asymmetric peak in the Raman spectra. Finally, the threefold rotational symmetry guarantees the existence of chiral phonons. We present direct spectroscopic evidence for these chiral vibrational modes through cross-circularly polarized Raman measurements, complemented by theoretical calculations of phonon circular polarization. Together, these results identify F5GT as an ideal platform for investigating emergent couplings among lattice, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom and for advancing the understanding of chiral phonons in magnetic van der Waals materials.

Title: Electronic and magnetic properties of the NdNiO$_2$/SrTiO$_3$ thin films
Authors: Sajid Sekh, Andrzej Ptok, Wojciech Brzezicki, Przemysław Piekarz, Andrzej M. Oleś
Abstract: The hole-doped NdNiO$_2$ layer deposited on the SrTiO$_{3}$ surface exhibits unconventional superconductivity. Here, we present a systematic study of the electronic and magnetic properties of the NdNiO$_2$ superconductor using the density functional theory (DFT). The strong local Coulomb interactions in the Ni($3d)$ and Nd($4f$) states are included within the DFT+$U$ method. The effect of Sr doping on the electronic band structure and density of states was studied for the NdNiO$_2$ thin films deposited on the SrTiO$_3$ (001) surface. The results obtained for the uncapped thin films were compared with the calculations for the NdNiO$_2$ films capped by the SrTiO$_3$ layer. We have found significant changes in the electronic structure and magnetic properties of the thin films compared to the bulk crystal.

Title: An introduction to monitored quantum systems and quantum trajectories: spectrum, typicality, and phases
Authors: Ryusuke Hamazaki, Ken Mochizuki, Hisanori Oshima, Yohei Fuji
Abstract: Thanks to recent experimental advances in simulating and detecting quantum dynamics with high precision and controllability, our understanding of the physics of monitored quantum systems has considerably deepened over the past decades. In this article, we provide an introductory theoretical review on the basic formalisms governing open quantum dynamics under measurement, along with recent developments in their spectral and typical aspects. After reviewing quantum measurement theory, we introduce the concept of quantum trajectories, which are the conditional dynamics of monitored states shaped by a set of measurement outcomes. We then discuss the spectral properties of the dynamical map describing the evolution averaged over measurement outcomes. As has recently been recognized, these spectral features are intimately connected to whether quantum trajectories exhibit typical behaviors, such as the ergodicity and purification. Moreover, we introduce Lyapunov exponents of typical quantum trajectories and discuss how these quantities serve as indicators of measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum many-body systems.

Title: Pyroelectric effects in hybrid semiconductor-lithium niobate quantum devices
Authors: Manas Ranjan Sahu, Suraj Thapa Magar, Yadav Prasad Kandel, John M. Nichol
Abstract: Hybrid quantum devices using surface acoustic waves show promise as key elements of quantum information processors. We report measurements of integrated flip-chip devices consisting of semiconductor quantum dots and surface acoustic wave resonators in lithium niobate. We observed that the pyroelectric effect in lithium niobate inhibited the operation of quantum dots in the integrated devices. GaAs/AlGaAs devices suffered from unintentional carrier depletion, and Si/SiGe devices suffered from electrostatic discharge. Our results highlight the importance of mitigating pyroelectric effects in semiconductor-lithium niobate hybrid devices for continued progress in quantum interconnects and transducers.

Title: Jordan-Wigner Transformation for the Description of Strong Correlation in Fermionic Systems

Abstract: Seniority is a useful way of organizing Hilbert space for strongly correlated systems. The exact zero-seniority wave function, doubly-occupied configuration interaction (DOCI), provides accurate results (given the right orbitals) for many strongly-correlated electronic systems, but has combinatorial computational cost. In many cases, pair coupled cluster doubles provides a polynomial-cost approximation that closely reproduces the energies of DOCI, but it breaks down in some cases and, as shown herein, it does not provide particularly good density matrices. In this work, we demonstrate that by using the Jordan-Wigner approximation to turn the seniority zero problem back into a fermionic one, we can provide variational results of DOCI quality for the Hubbard model and a few small molecular dissociation examples, with polynomial cost, both for the energies and for density matrices, all while being protected from collapse.

Title: Intrinsic spin Nernst effect in spin-triplet superconductors
Authors: Taiki Matsushita, Youichi Yanase, Takeshi Mizushima, Satoshi Fujimoto, Ilya Vekhter
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the intrinsic (impurity-independent) spin Nernst effect (SNE), a spin current generation perpendicular to temperature gradients, in spin-triplet superconductors. We show that, in these systems, the SNE consists of two distinct contributions: a direct quasiparticle contribution and an indirect supercurrent contribution. The quasiparticle contribution originates from the momentum space Berry curvature generated by spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The indirect contribution arises from a compensating supercurrent that cancels the bulk thermoelectric charge current. While this contribution vanishes when the condensate has no spin-polarization in momentum space, it can be comparable in magnitude to the quasiparticle contribution in nonunitary superconductors. These results demonstrate that thermoelectric spin supercurrent must be explicitly accounted for when evaluating the SNE in nonunitary superconductors.

Title: Quantized Quadrupole Superconductors
Authors: Yun-Mei Li, Yongwei Huang, Kai Chang
Abstract: We introduce a class of superconductors termed "quantized quadrupole superconductors" that support Majorana corner modes according to the bulk-corner correspondence, distinct from previous works on the second-order topological superconductors. An intrinsic physical quantity for superconductors, i.e., the quadrupole moment serves as the topological invariant, which is always half-quantized due to the particle-hole symmetry. As examples, two types of mixed pairings, $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\pm id_{xy}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\pm is$, induced in the bilayer two-dimensional electron gases with Rashba spin-orbit coupling give the quadrupole phase. Extended discussions indicate that the nontrivial phase is robust against relative phase fluctuations in the mixed pairings and the disorders. Our schemes provide realistic platforms to implement Majorana zero modes, paving the way for studying the Majorana physics.

Title: Superconductivity Near a Quantum Critical Point: Bounds on the Transition Temperature in the $γ$-Model
Authors: Ahmed Elezaby, Artem Abanov
Abstract: Near a quantum critical point (QCP) in a metal, strong Fermion-Fermion interactions mediated by soft collective bosons give rise to two competing phenomena: non-Fermi liquid behavior and superconductivity that deviates from conventional BCS and Migdal-Eliashberg theories. We consider the problem of obtaining closed-form analytical lower and upper bounds on transition temperatures for such systems. We focus mainly on a class of models known as the gamma-model, which generalizes the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity where the effective interaction potential scales as V(Omega) ~ 1/|Omega|^gamma. Building on a recent reformulation of Migdal-Eliashberg theory, expressed as a classical infinite spin chain with nonlocal interactions, and employing a simple linear algebra framework, we derive rigorous closed-form expressions for upper and lower bounds on the superconducting transition temperature for any gamma > 0. While our lower bounds coincide precisely with those previously in the literature, our derivation offers a more streamlined and accessible method. Moreover, our upper bounds are substantially tighter than any existing estimates and converge rapidly enough to the numerical results from various prior studies.

Title: Stress analysis of dilute particle suspensions in non-Newtonian fluids with efficient evaluation in the weakly non-Newtonian limit
Authors: Arjun Sharma, Donald L. Koch
Abstract: We present a semi-analytical framework to compute the suspension stress in dilute particle-laden non-Newtonian fluids, separating Newtonian and non-Newtonian contributions. The ensemble-averaged stress includes both the particle-induced non-Newtonian stress (PINNS) and an interaction stresslet arising from surface tractions due to the non-Newtonian stress and its induced Newtonian flow. Using a generalized reciprocal theorem, we express this interaction stresslet entirely in terms of the non-Newtonian stress, for a general constitutive model. For weakly non-Newtonian fluids, a regular perturbation expansion combined with the method of characteristics yields all leading-order stress contributions from the Newtonian velocity field alone, avoiding the need to solve coupled partial differential equations. This generalizes the method of Koch et al. (Phys. Rev. Fluids 1, 013301 (2016)) beyond polymeric fluids to any weakly non-Newtonian medium driven by velocity and its gradients. We apply the method to two systems: (i) spheres suspended in a fluid of smaller spheroids, where the interaction stress becomes negative for sufficiently anisotropic shapes due to orientation misalignment of the spheroids; and (ii) suspensions in weakly anisotropic nematic liquid crystals. In the latter, assuming a uniform director field fixed by an external field, PINNS vanishes while interaction stresslets remain, either opposing or enhancing background anisotropic stress. These results demonstrate the utility of our framework in capturing first-order particle-microstructure interactions across a broad class of non-Newtonian fluids.

Title: Altermagnetism Induced Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces Form Topological Superconductivity
Authors: Bo Fu, Chang-An Li, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: We propose a novel type of topological superconductivity based on Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) in an altermagnetic topological insulator proximitized by an s-wave superconductor. The 3D altermagnetic topological insulator is characterized by zero-energy surface states in bulk nodal-ring phases and anisotropically shifted surface Dirac cones in topological insulating phases. It is potentially realized in \mathrm{EuIn_{2}As_{2}}. The altermagnetic order in combination with superconductivity gives rise to highly anisotropic superconducting gaps with crystal-facet-dependent BFSs at the physical boundaries. These particular BFSs provide distinct platforms to realize Majorana zero modes (MZMs). We propose a quasi-1D nanowire in which the anisotropic BFSs experience topological phase transitions due to quantum confinement leading to MZMs at its ends. We further consider vortex phase transitions in the superconducting altermagnetic topological insulators. Remarkably, we find that the altermagnetic order allows us to transit between two distinct type of MZMs, one type is located at the vortex line, while the other type is located at the physical boundaries. Our work paves a new avenue utilizing altermagnetism-induced BFSs to engineer topological superconductivity through crystal anisotropy and quantum confinement.

Title: Microscopic and spectroscopic evidences for multiple ion-exchange reactions controlling biomineralization of CaO.MgO.2SiO2 nanoceramics
Authors: R. Vahedifard, E. Salahinejad
Abstract: This study is focused on the mechanism of in vitro biomineralization on the surface of CaO.MgO.2SiO2 (diopside) nanostructured coatings by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy assessments. A homogeneous diopside coating of almost 2 um in thickness was deposited on a medical-grade stainless steel by coprecipitation, dipping and sintering sequences. After soaking the sample in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for 14 days, a layer with the thickness of 8 {\mu}m is recognized to be substituted for the primary diopside deposit, suggesting the mineralization of apatite on the surface. Investigations revealed that the newly-formed layer is predominantly composed of Ca, P and Si, albeit with a biased accumulations of P and Si towards the surface and substrate, respectively. The variations in the ionic composition and pH of the SBF due to the incubation of the sample were also correlated with the above-interpreted biomineralization. In conclusion, the multiple ion-exchange reactions related to Ca, Mg, Si and P were found to be responsible for the in vitro bioactivity of nanodiopside.

Title: Dielectric and gate metal engineering for threshold voltage modulation in enhancement mode monolayer MoS2 field effect transistors
Authors: Lixin Liu, Han Yan, Leyi Loh, Kamal Kumar Paul, Soumya Sarkar, Deepnarayan Biswas, Tien-Lin Lee, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Manish Chhowalla, Yan Wang
Abstract: Excellent gate electrostatics in field effect transistors (FETs) based on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (2D TMD) channels can dramatically decrease static power dissipation. Energy efficient FETs operate in enhancement mode with small and positive threshold voltage (Vth) for n-type devices. However, most state-of-the-art FETs based on monolayer MoS2 channel operate in depletion mode with negative Vth due to doping from the underlying dielectric substrate. In this work, we identify key properties of the semiconductor/dielectric interface (MoS2 on industrially relevant high dielectric constant (k) HfO2, ZrO2 and hBN for reference) responsible for realizing enhancement-mode operation of 2D MoS2 channel FETs. We find that hBN and ZrO2 dielectric substrates provide low defect interfaces with MoS2 that enables effective modulation of the Vth using gate metals of different work functions (WFs). We use photoluminescence (PL) and synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to investigate doping levels in monolayer MoS2 on different dielectrics with different WF gate metals. We complement the FET and spectroscopic measurements with capacitance-voltage analysis on dielectrics with varying thicknesses, which confirm that Vth modulation in ZrO2 devices is correlated with WF of the gate metals - in contrast with HfO2 devices that exhibit signatures of Vth pinning induced by oxide/interface defect states. Finally, we demonstrate FETs using a 2D MoS2 channel and a 6 nm of ZrO2 dielectric, achieving a subthreshold swing of 87 mV dec-1 and a threshold voltage of 0.1 V. Our results offer insights into the role of dielectric/semiconductor interface in 2D MoS2 based FETs for realizing enhancement mode FETs and highlight the potential of ZrO2 as a scalable high-k dielectric.

Title: Ultrahigh Charge-to-Spin Conversion and Tunneling Magnetoresistance in Quasi-Two-Dimensional d-wave Altermagnet
Authors: Qing Zhang, Siyun Wang, Jianting Dong, Jia Zhang
Abstract: The emergence of altermagnets has driven groundbreaking advances in spintronics. Notably, d-wave altermagnets support non-relativistic spin transport, efficient charge-to-spin conversion, and T-odd spin currents. In addition, their integration as electrodes in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) enables a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, allowing electrical detection of Néel vectors for next-generation memory devices. In this work, we investigate the non-relativistic spin transport properties of the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) d-wave altermagnet KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O and the TMR effect in KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O-based AFMTJs via first-principles calculations. Our results reveal that KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O exhibits a non-relativistic longitudinal spin polarization and a spin Hall angle both exceeding 60\% at room temperature, while KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O-based AFMTJs achieve a giant TMR reaching approximately $10^{12}$\%, which remains robust against Fermi level shifts. These findings highlight the anisotropic spin polarization inherent to d-wave staggered magnetism and underscore the critical role of Fermi surface topology in enhancing T-odd spin transport and the TMR effect in AFMTJs.

Title: Gauge-Invariant Long-Wavelength TDDFT Without Empty States: From Polarizability to Kubo Conductivity Across Heterogeneous Materials
Authors: Christian Tantardini, Quentin Pitteloud, Boris Yakobson, Martin Andersson
Abstract: Electromagnetic response is commonly computed in two languages: length-gauge molecular polarizabilities and velocity-gauge (Kubo) conductivities for periodic solids. We introduce a compact, gauge-invariant bridge that carries the same microscopic inputs-transition dipoles and interaction kernels-from molecules to crystals and heterogeneous media, with explicit SI prefactors and fine-structure scaling via $(\alpha_{\rm fs})$. The long-wavelength limit is handled through a reduced dielectric matrix that retains local-field mixing, interfaces and 2D layers are treated with sheet boundary conditions (rather than naïve ultrathin films), and length-velocity equivalence is enforced in practice by including the equal-time (diamagnetic/contact) term alongside the paramagnetic current. Finite temperature is addressed on the Matsubara axis with numerically stable real-axis evaluation (complex polarization propagator), preserving unit consistency end-to-end. The framework enables predictive, unit-faithful observables from radio frequency to ultraviolet-RF/microwave heating and penetration depth, dielectric-logging contrast, interfacial optics of thin films and 2D sheets, and adsorption metrics via imaginary-axis polarizabilities. Numerical checks (gauge overlay and optical $(f)$-sum saturation) validate the implementation. Immediate priorities include compact, temperature- and salinity-aware kernels with quantified uncertainties and \emph{operando} interfacial diagnostics for integration into multiphysics digital twins.

Title: Multi-state electromagnetic phase modulations in NiCo2O4 through cation disorder and hydrogenation
Authors: Xuanchi Zhou, Xiaohui Yao, Shuang Li, Xiaomei Qiao, Jiahui Ji, Guowei Zhou, Huihui Ji, Xiaohong Xu
Abstract: One focal challenge in engineering low-power and scalable all-oxide spintronic devices lies in exploring ferromagnetic oxide material with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and electronic conductivity while exhibiting tunable spin states. Targeting this need, spinel nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4, NCO), featured by room-temperature ferrimagnetically metallic ground state with strong PMA, emerges as a promising candidate in the field of oxide spintronics. The cation distribution disorder inherent to NCO renders competing electromagnetic states and abnormal sign reversal of anomalous Hall effect (AHE), introducing an additional freedom to adjust electromagnetic transports. Here, we unveil multi-state electromagnetic phase modulations in NCO system through controllable cation disorder and proton evolution, extensively expanding electromagnetic phase diagram. The cation disorder in NCO tunable by growth temperature is identified as a critical control parameter for kinetically adjusting the proton evolution, giving rise to intermediate hydrogenated states with chemical stability. Hydrogen incorporation reversibly drives structural transformation and electromagnetic state evolutions in NCO, with rich spin-dependent correlated physics uncovered by combining the AHE scaling relation and synchrotron-based spectroscopy. Our work not only establishes NCO as a versatile platform for discovering spin-dependent physical functionality but also extends the horizons in materials design for state-of-the-art spintronic devices harnessing magneto-ionic control and inherent cation disorder.

Title: Geometry, electronic structure, and optical properties of boron cages: A first-principles DFT study
Authors: Kashinath T. Chavan, Ihsan Boustani, Alok Shukla
Abstract: A systematic study of the structural, electronic, and optical properties of cage-like boron clusters, with the number of constituent atoms ranging from 20 to 122, has been carried out within the framework of density-functional theory (DFT), employing 6-31G(d, p) extended basis set. The dynamic stability of the clusters is analyzed through the vibrational frequency analysis, while to study the thermodynamic stability, we computed their binding energies per atom. The results suggest that the 32- and 92-atom cages are the most stable among the small and the large structures. The optical absorption spectra of these cages is computed using the time-dependent densityfunctional theory (TDDFT), which suggests their applications in optoelectronic devices in the visible range of the spectrum.

Title: Linking Thermal History to Shear Band Interaction and Macroscopic Ductility in Metallic Glasses
Authors: Lechuan Sun, Shan Zhang, Bin Xu, Rui Su, Yunjiang Wang, Pengfei Guan
Abstract: Shear band propagation and interaction are critical to the mechanical performance of metallic glasses and are strongly governed by thermal history, yet their microscopic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations combined with a state-of-the-art annealing protocol, we systematically investigate these behaviors in a model metallic glass across effective quenching rates spanning six orders of magnitude. Through a double-notch model, we show that the normalized interaction distance relative to the single shear band width is significantly larger in slowly quenched samples than in rapidly quenched ones. Atomic-scale analysis reveals that rapidly quenched samples exhibit a high density of pre-existing soft regions, which trigger correlated shear transformation zones through local vortex fields, resulting in propagation path locking and weak inter-band coupling. In contrast, slowly quenched samples exhibit enhanced structural heterogeneity and a right-shifted activation energy spectrum, promoting a single large-scale vortex field ahead of the shear band front. This field facilitates long-range stress transmission and induces shear band deflection, convergence, and coalescence, a transition resembling a "shielding effect" in fracture mechanics, where vortex-mediated disturbances destabilize the advancing shear band front. Our findings establish a direct microscopic connection between glass stability and shear-band-mediated plasticity and suggest that regulating shear band interactions offers a promising route to enhance the room-temperature ductility of metallic glasses.

Title: From Interdependent Networks to Two-Interactions Physical Systems
Authors: Yuval Sallem, Nahala Yadid, Xi Wang, Irina volotsenko, Bnaya Gross, Beena Kalisky, Shlomo Havlin, Aviad Frydman
Abstract: Recent advances have shown that introducing dependency interactions between two superconducting networks can trigger abrupt, hysteretic normal-superconductor phase transitions. In this study, we demonstrate that such behavior can also arise in a single-network superconducting system that features two distinct types of interactions: short-range electrical connectivity and long-range thermal dependency. Using experimental and simulation methods, we show that when sufficient heat is dissipated within a single-layer disordered superconducting network, the system undergoes a mixed-order phase transition marked by both a discontinuous change in resistance and critical scaling behavior. We find that the emergence and characteristics of these abrupt transitions depend critically on the thermal conductivity of the underlying substrate, establishing heat flow as the origin of the unique phase transition. Additionally, both experimental and numerical results reveal long-lived transient states and scaling dynamics near the critical point, consistent with spontaneous branching processes observed in interdependent networks theory. These findings strongly demonstrate that complex critical phenomena, such as mixed-order transitions, previously attributed to structurally interdependent systems, can also arise within single-layer physical systems when dual interactions coexist. Our results broaden the scope of the theory and experiments of phase transitions in interdependent networks and suggest new ways to design and control phase changes in physical, biological, and technological systems where two interactions are present.

The structure, Raman spectra, low-temperature transport, Hall effect, magnetization, and magnetic susceptibility are studied. It was established that the crystals are ferromagnetic, with a Curie temperature ranging from 22 to 45\,K for different samples. Hall and magnetization measurements demonstrated that the system is a soft ferromagnet, which is of interest for practical applications.

Title: Turing Pattern Engineering Enables Kinetically Ultrastable yet Ductile Metallic Glasses
Authors: Huanrong Liu, Qingan Li, Shan Zhang, Rui Su, Yunjiang Wang, Pengfei Guan
Abstract: Enhancing the kinetic stability of glasses often necessitates deepening thermodynamic stability, which typically compromises ductility due to increased structural rigidity. Decoupling these properties remains a critical challenge for functional applications. Here, we demonstrate that pattern engineering in metallic glasses (MGs) enables unprecedented kinetic ultrastability while retaining thermodynamic metastability and intrinsic plasticity. Through atomistic simulations guided by machine-learning interatomic potentials and replica-exchange molecular dynamics, we reveal that clustering oxygen contents, driven by reaction-diffusion-coupled pattern dynamics, act as localized pinning sites. These motifs drastically slow structural relaxation, yielding kinetic stability comparable to crystal-like ultrastable glasses while retaining an energetic as-cast state. Remarkably, the thermodynamically metastable state preserves heterogeneous atomic mobility, allowing strain delocalization under mechanical stress. By tailoring oxygen modulation via geometric patterning, we achieve an approximately 200 K increase in the onset temperature of the glass transition (Tonset) while maintaining fracture toughness akin to conventional MGs. This work establishes a paradigm of kinetic stabilization without thermodynamic compromise, offering a roadmap to additively manufacture bulk amorphous materials with combined hyperstability and plasticity.

Title: Active Brownian particles in power-law viscoelastic media
Authors: David Santiago Quevedo, Monica Conte, Marjolein Dijkstra, Cristiane Morais Smith
Abstract: Many active particles are embedded in environments that exhibit viscoelastic properties. An important class of such media lacks a single characteristic relaxation timescale when subjected to a time-dependent stress. Rather, the stress response spans a broad continuum of timescales, a behavior naturally described by a scale-free, fractal-like power-law relaxation modulus. Using a generalization of the fractional Langevin equation, we investigate an active Brownian particle embedded in a power-law viscoelastic environment with translational and rotational dynamics governed by independent fractional orders. We solve the model analytically, develop a numerical scheme to validate the theoretical predictions, and provide tools that can be used in further studies. A rich variety of diffusion regimes emerges, which modify the intermediate-time behavior of the mean squared displacement. Notably, we find that the competition between translational and rotational contributions favors a superdiffusive persistence over the standard ballistic motion, and over-stretches its characteristic timescale, fundamentally altering the standard relation between persistence and propulsion in active matter.

Title: Symmetric Superconducting Dome Accompanied by Non-Fermi Liquid Transport in Ionic Liquid Gated-MoS2
Authors: Qiao Chen, Changshuai Lan, Huiqin Jian, Yi Yan, Xinming Zhao, Yihang Li, Huai Guan, Nina Girotto Erhardt, Dino Novko, Bo Gao, Chengyu Yan, Shun Wang
Abstract: In strongly correlated superconductors, the emergence of superconductivity is often accompanied by anomalous normal state. The connection between these two phenomena is considered crucial for understanding the underlying unconventional pairing mechanisms. In this study, we report analogous behavior in MoS2, a band insulator devoid of long-range magnetic order. Through ionic liquid gating, continuous doping control from the underdoped to the overdoped regime was achieved, revealing a symmetric superconducting dome that holds characteristic scaling relations mirror the behavior of strongly correlated superconductors. Strikingly, this system exhibits pronounced non-Fermi liquid transport near optimal doping, characterized by a quasi-linear temperature dependence of resistivity over a wide range and a T2-dependent Hall angle cotangent. The strength of the non-Fermi liquid transport is positively correlated with the superconducting transition temperature, with both evolving synchronously across the phase diagram. These results highlight the potential of MoS2 as an ideal platform for studying the intrinsic connection between non-Fermi liquid transport and superconductivity.

Title: Unveiling the Phase Diagram and Nonlinear Optical Responses of a Twisted Kitaev Chain
Authors: Ya-Min Quan, Shi-Qing Jia, Xiang-Long Yu, Hai-Qing Lin, Liang-Jian Zou
Abstract: Detecting Kitaev interactions in real materials remains challenge, as conventional experimental techniques often have difficulty distinguishing fractionalized excitations from other normal contributions. Terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) offers a novel approach for probing many-body phenomena, such as exotic excitations in quantum magnets. Motivated by recent experiments on CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and the development of the terahertz spectroscopy in Kitaev quantum spin liquid, we proposed a twisted Kitaev model for CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and determined the precise twist angle according to experimental specific-heat phase diagram. With this calibrated model, we found that non-rephasing diagonal and rephasing anti-diagonal signals appear in the 2DCS nonlinear response. The $x$ and $y$ components of the spin superexchange interactions split the rephasing signals into a grid of discrete peaks. We further demonstrate that the diagonal and the discrete rephasing signals primarily originate from two-spinon and four-spinon excitation processes based on numerical projection method. These findings indicate that even weak Kitaev interactions in quantum materials can be effectively detected via two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy .

Title: Composition-Based Machine Learning for Screening Superconducting Ternary Hydrides from a Curated Dataset
Authors: Kazuaki Tokuyama, Souta Miyamoto, Taichi Masuda, Katsuaki Tanabe
Abstract: We present an ensemble machine-learning approach for composition-based, structure-agnostic screening of candidate superconductors among ternary hydrides under high pressure. Hydrogen-rich hydrides are known to exhibit high superconducting transition temperatures, and ternary or multinary hydrides can stabilize superconducting phases at reduced pressures through chemical compression. To systematically explore this vast compositional space, we construct an ensemble of 30 XGBoost regression models trained on a curated dataset of approximately 2000 binary and ternary hydride entries. The model ensemble is used to screen a broad set of A-B-H compositions at pressures of 100, 200, and 300 GPa, with screening outcomes evaluated statistically based on prediction consistency across ensemble members. This analysis highlights several high-scoring compositional systems, including Ca-Ti-H, Li-K-H, and Na-Mg-H, which were not explicitly included in the training dataset. In addition, feature-importance analysis indicates that elemental properties such as ionization energy and atomic radius contribute significantly to the learned composition-level trends in superconducting transition temperature. Overall, these results demonstrate the utility of ensemble-based machine learning as a primary screening tool for identifying promising regions of chemical space in superconducting hydrides.

Title: Benchmarking Universal Interatomic Potentials on Elemental Systems
Authors: Hossein Tahmasbi, Andreas Knüpfer, Thomas D. Kühne, Hossein Mirhosseini
Abstract: The rapid emergence of universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (uMLIPs) has transformed materials modeling. However, a comprehensive understanding of their generalization behavior across configurational space remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate both the equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium performance of state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including three MACE-based models, MatterSim, and PET-MAD. Our assessment utilizes Equation-of-State (EOS) tests to evaluate near-equilibrium properties, such as bulk moduli and equilibrium volumes, alongside extensive Minima Hopping (MH) structural searches to probe the global Potential Energy Surface (PES). Here, we assess universality within the fundamental limit of unary (elemental) systems, which serve as a necessary baseline for broader chemical generalization and provide a framework that can be systematically extended to multicomponent materials. We find that while most models exhibit high accuracy in reproducing equilibrium volumes for transition metals, significant performance gaps emerge in alkali and alkaline earth metal groups. Crucially, our MH results reveal a decoupling between search efficiency and structural fidelity, highlighting that smoother learned PESs do not necessarily yield more accurate energetic landscapes.

Title: High-quality and field resilient microwave resonators on Ge/SiGe quantum well heterostructures
Authors: Luigi Ruggiero, Carlo Ciacca, Pauline Drexler, Vera Jo Weibel, Christian Olsen, Christian Schönenberger, Dominique Bougeard, Andrea Hofmann
Abstract: Superconducting resonators integrated with Ge quantum wells (QWs) offer a promising platform for hybrid quantum devices. Yet, in the most common heterostructure architectures, they have so far been limited by sizable photon losses. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of microwave resonators patterned in the Al thin film of an in-situ grown superconductor/semiconductor hybrid heterostructure (HS). The semiconductor part of this hybrid HS is grown on a commercial Ge substrate. We consistently achieve internal quality factors $Q_i>1000$, surpassing previous results on Ge QW heterostructures grown using the concept of a virtual Ge substrate on Si substrates. We reach $Q_i \approx 49000$ at single-photon occupation and a plateau of $Q_i \approx 20000$ at sub-one photon, an order of magnitude larger than any previously reported value of resonators on Ge QW structures at low power. We further characterize the thin Al film forming the resonator, extracting its kinetic inductance and superconducting gap, and studying its magnetic field dependence. Notably, the resonance remains well-defined up to in-plane magnetic fields of 850 mT. A hysteresis emerges in the out-of-plane magnetic field dependence, for both the resonance frequency and the quality factor, indicating an interesting interplay between vortex- and quasiparticle loss mechanisms.

Authors: Enlin Shen, Tiberiu I. Popescu, Nishwal Gora, Guratinder Kaur, Edmond Chan, Harry Lane, Jose A. Rodriguez-Rivera, Guangyong Xu, Peter M. Gehring, Russell A. Ewings, Andy N. Fitch, Chris Stock
Abstract: The discovery of ordered magnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals materials at the monolayer limit challenges the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries in two dimensions at finite temperatures. The persistence of static magnetism in low-dimensions is fundamentally influenced by magnetic anisotropy and the local single-ion crystalline electric field. Crucially, spin-orbit coupling connects the structural properties with spin degrees of freedom. We investigate the magnetic single-ion properties in the van der Waals magnet VI$_3$. Utilizing neutron and x-ray diffraction, we map out the symmetry breaking phase transitions and argue for a single structural transition at T$_S \sim$ 80 K, driven by an orbital degeneracy, followed by a ferromagnetic transition at a lower temperature, T$_C \sim$ 50 K. Through a comparative analysis of samples prepared under varying conditions, we suggest that lower temperature transitions reported near $\sim$ 30 K are not intrinsic to VI$_{3}$. A group theoretical analysis suggests a structural transition from rhombohedral $R\overline{3}$ to triclinic $P\overline{1}$ or $P1$. This transition is significant as it suggests the formation of two distinct crystallographyically inequivalent V$^{3+}$ sites, each with distinct spin-orbital properties. Neutron spectroscopy provides evidence for dominant magnetic exchange coupling only between symmetry-equivalent sites in the triclinc unit cell. We suggest this breaks up the low-temperature honeycomb VI$_3$ lattice into two interpenetrating approximately hexagonal planes resulting in a fragmentated honeycomb. Our findings highlight the critical role of magnetoelastic coupling in determining the magnetic and structural phases in two-dimensional van der Waals magnets.

Title: Effect of Underlayer Induced Charge Carrier Substitution on the Superconductivity of Ti40V60 Alloy Thin Films
Authors: Shekhar Chandra Pandey, Shilpam Sharma, L. S. Sharath Chandra, M.K. Chattopadhyay
Abstract: The influence of metallic and semiconducting (V, Al, and Si) under-layer induced charge carrier substitution on the superconducting properties of the Ti40V60 alloy thin films are studied and also compared with a pristine reference film without any under-layer. All the films exhibit metallic behavior in the normal state and a superconducting transition at low temperatures, where the superconducting transition temperature is tunable between 4.77 K and 5.73 K. Hall measurements on the films reveal that the under-layer strongly affects the charge carrier type and density, leading to a correlation between increasing carrier concentration and decreasing TC. The Si under-layer introduces the highest disorder yet yields the highest TC, indicating that in the Ti40V60 alloys, moderate disorder suppresses the spin-fluctuations induced pair breaking, thereby enhancing the superconductivity. The comparable TC of the V under-layer and pristine films without under-layer, along with a coherence length (~6.2 nm) much smaller than the film thickness (25 nm), confirms the absence of any significant proximity effects. These findings demonstrate that under-layer engineering provides an effective route to tune the superconducting properties of Ti-V alloy thin films.

Title: Reductive Contact and Dipolar Interface Engineering Enable Stable Flexible CsSnI3 Nanowire Photodetectors
Authors: Letian Dai, Wanru Chen, Quanming Geng, Ying Xu, Guowu Zhou, Nuo Chen, Xiongjie Li
Abstract: Lead-free tin-based halide perovskites are attractive for flexible and environmentally benign optoelectronics, but their application is limited by the rapid oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and poor operational stability. Here, we report a flexible CsSnI3 nanowire photodetector that achieves both high near-infrared photoresponse and long-term stability through synergistic aluminium-substrate contact engineering and dipolar interface modification. A 0.2 mm anodized aluminium foil serves as the flexible substrate, where localized laser ablation exposes metallic aluminium regions that act as reductive sites, effectively suppressing Sn2+ oxidation during nanowire growth. Simultaneously, a polar interlayer of 3-fluoro-2-nitroanisole is introduced to improve energy-level alignment, suppress interfacial deprotonation, and enhance charge extraction. The resulting device exhibits a responsivity of 0.39 A W-1, a specific detectivity of 1.38 * 10^13 Jones, and a wide linear dynamic range of 156 dB under 850 nm illumination. Moreover, the device retains over 85% of its initial photocurrent after 60 days in ambient air and maintains 94% of its initial photocurrent after 1000 bending cycles. This work establishes an effective strategy for stabilizing Sn-based perovskites toward high-performance flexible optoelectronic devices.

Authors: Pabitra Masanta, Ratan Sarkar, Punit Parmananda, Raghunath Chelakkot
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous motion of an elliptical Janus particle, driven by Marangoni forces, on a water surface to understand how particle shape and size influence its dynamics. The Janus particle is one-half infused with a substance such as camphor, which lowers the surface tension upon release onto the water surface. The resulting surface tension gradient generates Marangoni forces that propel the particle. For fully camphor-infused (non-Janus) particles, previous studies have shown that motion occurs along the short axis of the ellipse. However, for Janus particles, our experiments reveal a much richer steady-state dynamics, depending on both the particle's eccentricity and size. To understand these dynamics, we develop a numerical model that captures the connection between the spatio-temporal evolution of the camphor concentration field and the Marangoni force driving the particle. Using this model, we simulate the motion of particles with varying eccentricities - from nearly circular to highly elongated shapes. The simulations qualitatively reproduce all the trajectories observed in experiments and provide insights into how particle geometry influences the dynamics of chemically driven anisotropic particles. With the help of the numerical model, we compute a full phase diagram characterising the dynamical states as a function of surfactant properties.

Title: Universal quasi-degenerate orbital origin of two-dome phases in iron pnictide superconductors
Authors: Da-Yong Liu, Zhe Sun, Feng Lu, Wei-Hua Wang, Liang-Jian Zou
Abstract: A series of experiments revealed that novel bipartite magnetic and superconducting (SC) phases widely exist in the phase diagrams of iron pnictides and chalcogenides. Nevertheless, the origin of the two-dome magnetic and SC phases in iron-based compounds remains unclear. Here we theoretically investigated the electronic structures, magnetic and SC properties of three representative iron-based systems, i.e. LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$H$_{x}$, LaFeAs$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$O and KFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$. We propose a unified quasi-degenerate orbital mechanism for the emergence of the two-dome parent magnetic/structural phase and the subsequent two-dome SC phase. It is found that the degenerate in-plane anisotropic $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals dominate the first magnetic/structural and SC phases, while in-plane isotropic orbitals $d_{xy}$ or $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ with quasi-degeneracy originating from quasi-symmetry drive the emergence of the second magnetic/SC dome phase. Moreover, a matching rule of spin and orbital modes for SC pairing state is proposed in multi-orbital iron-based systems. These results imply an orbital-driven mechanism as well as an orbital-selective scenario, and shed light on the understanding of the multi-dome magnetic and SC phases in multi-orbital systems.

Title: Spatiotemporal Chaos and Defect Proliferation in Polar-Apolar Active Mixture
Authors: Partha Sarathi Mondal, Tamas Vicsek, Shradha Mishra
Abstract: Chaotic transitions in inertial fluids typically proceed through a direct energy cascade from large to small scales. In contrast, active systems, composed of self propelled units, inject energy at microscopic scales and therefore exhibit an inverse cascade, giving rise to distinctly unconventional flow patterns. Here, we investigate an active mixture consisting of both apolar and polar self driven components, a setting expected to display richer behaviours than those found in living liquid crystal (LLC) systems, where the apolar constituent is passive. Using numerical solutions of the corresponding hydrodynamic equations, we uncover a variety of complex dynamical states. Our results reveal a non-monotonic response of the apolar species to changes in the density and activity of the polar component. In an intermediate regime, reminiscent of LLC-induced disorder, the system develops a dynamically disordered phase characterised by high-density, chaotically evolving band-like structures and by the continual creation and annihilation of half integer topological defects. We show that this regime exhibits spatiotemporal chaos, which we quantify through two complementary measures: the spectral properties of density fluctuations and the maximal Lyapunov exponent. Together, these findings broaden the understanding of complex transitions in active matter and suggest potential experimental realisations in bacterial suspensions or synthetic microswimmer assemblies.

Title: Critical Temperature(s) of Sierpiński Carpet(s)
Authors: Riccardo Ben Alì Zinati, Giacomo Gori, Alessandro Codello
Abstract: We present a key algorithmic improvement to the generalized combinatorial Feynman--Vdovichenko method for calculating the critical temperature of the Ising model on Sierpiński carpets $SC_k(a,b)$, originally introduced in {\tt arXiv:1505.02699}. By reformulating the method in terms of purely real-valued transfer matrices, we substantially reduce their dimension. This optimization, together with modern computational resources, enables us to reach generation $k=10$ for the canonical $SC_k(3,1)$ carpet. Extrapolation from these data yields the most accurate estimate to date of the critical temperature $T_c^{(3,1)} = 1.4782927(26)$. We further extend the analysis to additional members of the $SC_k(a,b)$ family and report their corresponding critical temperatures.

Title: Multiple topological phases of magnons induced by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and pseudodipolar anisotropic exchange interactions in Kagome ferromagnets
Authors: Jin-Yu Ni, Xia-Ming Zheng, Peng-Tao Wei, Da-Yong Liu, Liang-Jian Zou
Abstract: Kagome magnets naturally hosting Dirac points and flat bands exhibit novel topological phases, enabling rich interplays between interactions and topologies. The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets generally coexisting with different types of magnetic interactions poses a challenge for topological magnonic manipulation. Here we investigate the topological magnon phases of 2D Kagome ferromagnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions, i.e. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI). It is found that the different sole magnetic anisotropic interactions introduce completely distinct topological phase diagrams and topological states. The multiple topological magnon phases with high Chern number emerge due to the distinct anisotropic interactions. Moreover, the interplay of the multiple anisotropic DMI and PDI interactions involved with Dirac and flat bands controls a variety of topological phase transitions, implying greater manipulation potential. In addition, the sign reversal of thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities induced by temperature is found in particular topological phase regions, namely topological origin, relating to the energy gap and Berry curvature (Chern number) in the vicinity of magnetic phase transition from the thermal fluctuations, providing a possible explanation for the experimental puzzles. All these results demonstrate that the novel topological magnonic properties in Kagome magnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions can realize a potential platform for magnonic devices and quantum computing.

Title: Local composition fluctuations act as precursors for crystal nucleation in polydisperse hard spheres
Authors: Marjolein de Jager, Antoine Castagnède, Frank Smallenburg, Laura Filion
Abstract: We revisit the effect of polydispersity on the crystal nucleation of hard spheres. Using event-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we obtain the nucleation rate as a function of the supersaturation for a range of polydispersities, and demonstrate that the nucleation rate of polydisperse hard spheres deviates from the trend of monodisperse hard spheres, even when mapped to the effective packing fraction. Furthermore, we show that nucleation tends to originate in regions with on average more larger-sized particles, indicating that such regions act as precursors for nucleation in systems of polydisperse hard spheres.

Title: Optimal navigation in a noisy environment
Authors: Abhijit Sinha, Sandeep Jangid, Tridib Sadhu, Shankar Ghosh
Abstract: Navigating toward a known target in a noisy environment is a fundamental problem shared across biological, physical, and engineered systems. Although optimal strategies are often framed in terms of continuous, fine-grained feedback, we show that efficient navigation emerges from a far simpler principle: natural wandering punctuated by intermittent course corrections. Using a controlled robotic platform, active Brownian particle simulations, and scaling theory, we identify a universal trade-off between noise-induced deviation and the finite cost of reorientation, yielding an optimal course correction frequency governed by only a few system parameters. Despite their differing levels of complexity, our experiment and theory collapse onto common quantitative signatures, including first-passage time distribution and non-Gaussian angular dispersion. Our results establish intermittent course-correction as a minimal and robust alternative to continuous feedback, offering a unifying guiding principle for point-to-point navigation in complex environments.

Title: Optical cooling of nuclear spins in GaAs/(Al,Ga)As quantum wells at subkelvin temperatures: Evidence of the dynamic self-polarization of nuclear spins
Authors: M. Kotur, D. Kudlacik, N. E. Kopteva, E. Kirstein, D. R. Yakovlev, K. V. Kavokin, M. Bayer
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic polarization of nuclear spins in a nominally undoped GaAs/Al$_{0.35}$Ga$_{0.65}$As quantum well using two complementary experimental approaches: time-resolved Kerr rotation and optical orientation measurements of photoluminescence. Using the first technique, we measure a remarkably large Overhauser field of 3.1 T in a geometry close to the Faraday configuration for a 19.7 nm wide quantum well at a temperature of 1.6 K. A nuclear spin temperature of 6.4 $\mu$K is measured at an external magnetic field of 0.006 T following an adiabatic sweep from 0.6 T. Despite the quadrupole-induced nuclear spin splitting inherent to nanostructures, the nuclear spin system is found to follow the predictions of spin temperature theory. Using the optical orientation of the photoluminescence, we investigated nuclear spin dynamics at millikelvin temperatures down to 300 mK. At a temperature of 500 mK, an Overhauser field of 160 mT is generated in an oblique but nearly Voigt magnetic field using low optical power to avoid heating. The nuclear polarization build-up time is of 150 s, consistent with earlier reports at higher temperatures, where hyperfine scattering on free photoexcited electrons governs relaxation. At 500 mK, the onset of dynamic self-polarization of nuclear spins is observed, which becomes more pronounced as the lattice temperature is further reduced to 300 mK. The estimated nuclear spin temperature in the dynamic self-polarization regime can be as low as 200 nK.

Title: Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Si, Ga, Ge, Sn) Heusler alloys as candidate materials for spintronic and microelectronic applications: Electronic structure, transport, and magnetism
Authors: Vyacheslav V. Marchenkov, Alena A. Semiannikova, Evgeny D. Chernov, Alexey V. Lukoyanov, Valentin Yu. Irkhin, Yulia A. Perevozchikova, Elena B. Marchenkova
Abstract: Magnetic and electronic transport properties of Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ga, Ge, Si, Sn) Heusler alloys were experimentally investigated. Electrical resistivity, in the temperature range from 4.2 to 300 K, as well as field dependences of the Hall effect and magnetization at T = 4.2 K in magnetic fields up to 100 kOe and 70 kOe, respectively, were measured. Experimental data are in good agreement with the results of the theoretical DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic moments. In the band structure of Co$_2$MnSi, half-metallicity is formed with the full spin polarization and the half-metallic gap of about 0.6 eV. In Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ge, Sn), it is shifted from the Fermi energy by the hole pockets at the point $\Gamma$, preventing thereby the formation of the half-metallic state. In a peculiar case of Co$_2$MnGa, the antisite defects are expected to determine structural and electronic properties. For the Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa topological semimetals, Weyl topological points are found at the Fermi energy; however, for Z = Si, Ge, Si, these features are located deeper within to the valence band. The results show that Co$_2$MnGe and Co$_2$MnSn are usual ferromagnets, Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa alloys are topological semimetals that can find application in microelectronics, while Co$_2$MnSi is a half-metallic ferromagnet that is in high demand in spintronics.

Title: Distinct Suppression Mechanisms of Superconductivity by Magnetic Domains and Spin Fluctuations in EuFe2(As1-xPx)2 superconductors
Authors: Mengju Yuan, Nan Zhou, Ruixia Ti, Long Zhang, Chenyang Zhang, Tian Hao Deliu Ou, Jingchun Gao, Mingquan He, Aifeng Wang, Jun-Yi Ge, Yue Sun, Yisheng Chai
Abstract: Using ac composite magnetoelectric technique, we map the phase diagrams of EuFe(As1-xPx)2 to resolve the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. For samples with Tc<TFM, the transition to a ferromagnetic multi-domain state suppresses Hc2 through the breakdown of Jaccarino-Peter compensation and enhanced magnetic scattering from inter-domain disorder, while Hirr is reduced due to vortex-antivortex pair nucleation at domain walls disrupting the vortex lattice. Conversely, for samples with Tc>TFM, strong short-range spin correlations and phase boundaries within a multiphase coexistence regime near the triple point act as potent pair-breaking centers, leading to pronounced Hc2 suppression.

Title: Intercalant-induced Kekule ordering and gap opening in quasi-free-standing graphene
Authors: Huu Thoai Ngo, Zamin Mamiyev, Niklas Witt, Tim Wehling, Christoph Tegenkamp
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural and electronic properties of Sn intercalated buffer layers on SiC(0001) using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (LT-STM/STS), spot-profile analysis low-energy electron diffraction (SPA-LEED), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Sn intercalation effectively decouples the buffer layer, yielding quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) while introducing local lattice distortions. Bias-dependent STM imaging revealed the coexistence of conventional and Kekule-ordered graphene domains, governed by the underlying Sn(1x1) reconstruction at the SiC interface. The measured STS spectra exhibit good agreement with DFT results. However, achieving homogeneous Sn(1x1) domains remains challenging, apparently, due to strain within the Sn monolayer, which drives the emergence of Kekule distortions and the associated electronic band-gap opening omogeneously in graphene. These findings highlight the crucial role of intercalant homogeneity and strain in tuning graphene`s structural and electronic properties.

Title: Electrical Drive of a Josephson Junction Array using a Cryogenic BiCMOS Pulse Pattern Generator: Towards a Fully Integrated Josephson Arbitrary Waveform Synthesizer
Authors: Yerzhan Kudabay, Oliver Kieler, Michael Starkloff, Marco Schubert, Michael Haas, Johannes Kohlmann, Mark Bieler, Vadim Issakov
Abstract: We combine a cryogenic BiCMOS integrated circuit, which generates high-speed return-to-zero (RTZ) pulses, with a superconducting Josephson junction array. The BiCMOS circuit acts as a cryogenic pulse pattern generator, delivering data rates of 30 Gb/s, while consuming 302 mW at 4 K. Each electrical pulse of the serializer effectively transfers one magnetic flux quantum through every Josephson junction, so that the average output voltage of the array produces well-defined plateaus (Shapiro steps) in its current-to-voltage characteristic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integration of a Josephson junction array with a cryogenic BiCMOS chip. The presented results pave the way toward a hybrid and fully integrated Josephson arbitrary waveform synthesizer (JAWS) that can generate ultra-low-noise signals for quantum voltage metrology and quantum information systems.

Title: Isotropic conductivity of two-dimensional three- and four-phase symmetric composites: duality and universal bounds
Authors: Leonid Fel
Abstract: We consider the problem of isotropic effective conductivity $\sigma_e(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)$ in two-dimensional three- and four-phase symmetric composites with a partial isotropic conductivity $\sigma_j$ of the $j$-th phase. The upper $\Omega(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)$ and lower $\omega(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)$, $n=3,4$, bounds for effective conductivity, found by the algebraic approach, are universal (independent of the composite micro-structure) and possess all algebraic properties of $\sigma_e(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)$ that follow from physics: first-order homogeneity, full permutation invariance, Keller's self-duality, positivity, and monotony. The bounds are compatible with the trivial solution $\sigma_e(\sigma,\ldots,\sigma)=\sigma$ and satisfy Dykhne's ansatz. Their comparison with previously known numerical calculations, asymptotic analysis, and exact results for isotropic effective conductivity $\sigma_e(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)$ of two-dimensional three- and four-phase composites showed complete agreement. The bounds $\Omega(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)$ and $\omega(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)$ in both cases $n=3,4$ are stronger than the currently known variational bounds.

Title: Surface Exciton Polaritons and Near-Zero Permittivity Surface Waves Supported by Artificial Organic Hyperbolic Metamaterials
Authors: José N. Gama, Diogo Cunha, Carla Estévez-Varela, Marina García-Pardo, Pablo Pedreira, Adelaide Miranda, M. Carmen López-González, Pieter A.A. De Beule, Eduardo Solano, Rosalia Serna, Mikhail Vasilevskiy, Martin Lopez-Garcia, Isabel Pastoriza-Santos, Sara Núñez-Sánchez
Abstract: Hyperbolic metamaterials enable extreme light confinement and control of photonic states, but their realization has been restricted to inorganic architectures. Here, a fully organic route to fabricate artificial hyperbolic metamaterials based on multilayered thin films of J-aggregate carbocyanine dyes alternated with polyelectrolytes is introduced. These structures exhibit strong optical anisotropy and experimentally support hyperbolic surface exciton polaritons and, for selected dyes, additional surface waves in near-zero permittivity regimes. Spectroscopic ellipsometry confirms a uniaxial dielectric tensor with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane components, close to the absorption peaks of the constituent J-aggregates. This anisotropy is preserved across individual layers, demonstrating the robustness of the layer-by-layer approach and enabling the coupling of surface exciton polaritons and near-zero permittivity modes even in films only a few nanometres thick. Transfer-matrix simulations based on the obtained dielectric tensor reproduce the coupling conditions for all thicknesses, validating the optical model. Structural characterization reveals the link between optical anisotropy and supramolecular order, with preferential in-plane molecular orientation and the evolution from discrete nanostructures to continuous films as deposition progresses. These organic hyperbolic metamaterial architectures, associated with narrow excitonic resonances from J-aggregates, offer a unique platform for tailoring emission, energy transport, and exploring polariton dynamics at the nanoscale.

Title: Iterative learning scheme for crystal structure prediction with anharmonic lattice dynamics
Authors: Hao Gao, Yue-Wen Fang, Ion Errea
Abstract: First-principles based crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods have revealed an essential tool for the discovery of new materials. However, in solids close to displacive phase transitions, which are common in ferroelectrics, thermoelectrics, charge-density wave systems, or superconducting hydrides, the ionic contribution to the free energy and lattice anharmonicity become essential, limiting the capacity of CSP techniques to determine the thermodynamical stability of competing phases. While variational methods like the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) accurately account for anharmonic lattice dynamics \emph{ab initio}, their high computational cost makes them impractical for CSP. Machine-learning interatomic potentials offer accelerated sampling of the energy landscape compared to purely first-principles approaches, but their reliance on extensive training data and limited generalization restricts practical applications. Here, we propose an iterative learning framework combining evolutionary algorithms, atomic foundation models, and SSCHA to enable CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics. Foundation models enable robust relaxations of random structures, drastically reducing required training data. Applied to the highly anharmonic H$_3$S system, our framework achieves good agreement with the benchmarks based on density functional theory, accurately predicting phase stability and vibrational properties from 50 to 200 GPa. Importantly, we find that the statistical averaging in the SSCHA reduces the error in the free energy evaluation, avoiding the need for extremely high accuracy of machine-learning potentials. This approach bridges the gap between data efficiency and predictive power, establishing a practical pathway for CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics.

Title: Opening a gap in the collective excitation modes of a driven-dissipative condensate in the presence of an external coherent drive
Authors: E. Stazzu, G. A. P. Sacchetto, I. Carusotto
Abstract: We build a minimal theoretical model to describe the opening of a gap in the dispersion of the collective excitations of a driven-dissipative condensate when the condensate phase is fixed by an additional coherent phase-locking drive. We map out the phase diagram as a function of the frequency and the strength of the coherent drive. We identify regions where the gap is purely imaginary or has a finite real part. When the coherent drive is unable to lock the condensate phase, a gapless Goldstone mode is recovered in the Floquet-Bogoliubov dispersion of collective modes. We finally characterize regions of finite-wavevector dynamical instability, where the condensate tends to develop a supersolid-like spatial modulation. While our theoretical framework is directly related to recent experiments with exciton-polariton condensates, it can be applied to describe the effect of external injection also in a variety of spatially extended optical parametric oscillators or laser devices.

Title: Tensor-network study of the ground state of maple-leaf Heisenberg antiferromagnet
Authors: Samuel Nyckees, Pratyay Ghosh, Frédéric Mila
Abstract: We study the quantum phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) combined with a corner transfer matrix renormalization group scheme adapted to $C_3$-symmetric lattices. Focusing on the fully antiferromagnetic $J$-$J_d$ model with $J_h = J_t := J$, we map out the ground-state phase diagram as a function of the dimer coupling $J_d$. Our results show that the system hosts only two phases: a magnetically ordered canted-$120^\circ$ phase and an exact dimer singlet product phase. We identify a first-order transition between these two phases at $J_d/J \approx 1.45$. Within the magnetically ordered phase, we observe small but finite magnetic moments. We also resolve the quantum renormalization of the canting angle, which deviates from the classical prediction over almost the entire magnetically ordered phase.

Title: Quantum vs thermal fluctuations in phase transitions of two-dimensional superconductors
Authors: Andrea Ponticelli, Francesco Giuseppe Capone, Vittorio Cataudella, Giulio De Filippis, Antonio De Candia, Carmine Antonio Perroni
Abstract: We investigate the impact of quantum and thermal phase fluctuations on the suppression of superconducting order in two-dimensional systems. Within the two-dimensional quantum XY model in the phase representation, where on-site interaction terms govern quantum phase fluctuations, we perform extensive path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting temperature-interaction phase diagram establishes the presence of a well-defined critical line ending at a quantum critical point at vanishing temperature with no indication of reentrant behavior. We further demonstrate that the resistance above the critical line reproduces the two expected different critical behaviors. For stronger interactions, above the quantum critical point, the system exhibits a crossover to an insulating regime at low temperatures. Finally, Monte Carlo calculations of current-current correlation functions enable us to extract the frequency-dependent conductivity in both superconducting and normal regimes, revealing a finite-frequency response that we attribute to quantum phase fluctuations.

Title: Optoelectronically Directed Self-Assembly of Active and Passive Particles into Programmable and Reconfigurable Colloidal Structures
Authors: Donggang Cao, Sankha Shuvra Das, Gilad Yossifon
Abstract: Controlled assembly of active-passive colloidal mixtures offers a route to reconfigurable microscale machines, but their self-assembly pathways remain poorly understood. We study the directed assembly of metallo-dielectric Janus particles (JPs) and passive polystyrene (PS) beads using optoelectrically reconfigurable AC-field patterning, which allows precise control over particle composition and binding sequence. Through experiments, analytical modeling, and simulations, we show that dipolar interactions drive robust JP-JP and JP-PS dimer formation with frequency-dependent stability. At intermediate and high frequencies, JP-PS binding is strongly attractive, whereas at low frequencies it becomes effectively repulsive due to electrical double-layer screening and electrohydrodynamic flows at the metallic hemisphere. In multi-particle systems, PS beads act as cooperative hubs that hierarchically recruit JPs, yielding higher-order hybrid structures. We identify structural isomers - for example, 3JP + 1PS clusters can form chain-like or triangular configurations depending on assembly sequence. Simulations confirm both as equilibrium states, with the triangular isomer slightly more stable. Similar polymorphism appears in larger clusters (4JPs). Overall, we establish a framework for controlled active-passive colloidal assembly, showing how frequency-tunable interactions and structural polymorphism enable the design of reconfigurable colloidal machines for applications in microrobotics, targeted delivery, and adaptive materials.

Title: Electronic states at twist stacking faults in rhombohedral graphite
Authors: Xiaoqian Liu, Yifei Guan, Oleg V. Yazyev
Abstract: Flat bands in graphitic materials emerged as a platform for realizing tunable correlated physics. As a nodal-line semimetal, rhombohedral graphite features flat drumhead surface states in the vicinity of the Dirac points, which carry a nontrivial topological charge. We present a comprehensive study on rhombohedral graphite with twist stacking faults. Using both the continuum models and the realistic tight-binding models, we show that the twist angle between the graphene layers can tune the interface states at such stacking faults. The evolution of interface states originates from the interplay between the moiré periodicity and Zak phase topology, predicting the occurrence of nearly flat bands throughout the moiré Brillouin zone. We further investigate the disorder-induced layer polarization and tunable Chern number for flat band, and characterize the relationship between the disorder strength and Chern number in twisted rhombohedral graphite.

Title: Ferrofluids under oscillatory magnetic fields
Authors: Taige Wang, Kaiyuan Gu, Anzhou Wang, Zhentang Wang
Abstract: Ferrofluids exhibit two canonical interfacial instabilities, a static Rosensweig (normal-field) instability that produces a lattice of peaks and a dynamical Faraday instability that produces parametrically excited standing waves. Here we present a systematic phase diagram of ferrofluid surface states driven by a purely AC vertical magnetic field with zero mean. Scanning a broad range of frequencies and field amplitudes, we resolve two robust branches: a Faraday-wave regime that includes a stable square lattice and a Rosensweig-like peak--valley regime indistinguishable in morphology from Rosensweig peaks. The Faraday-onset boundary is well described by a power law close to $\sqrt{f}$, while the Rosensweig-like peak onset becomes essentially frequency independent at low viscosity. The wave vector of the square lattice grows linearly with frequency over our accessible band. We present a surface-wave theory that captures the full phenomenology, including the emergence of Rosensweig peaks under zero-mean AC driving, the near-$\sqrt{f}$ scaling of the phase boundaries, the linear growth of the selected wave vector with frequency, and the preference for square over hexagonal lattices.

Title: Shear viscosity at finite magnetic field for graphene, non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic cases
Authors: Cho Win Aung, Thandar Zaw Win, Subhalaxmi Nayak, Sabyasachi Ghosh
Abstract: Present article has addressed finite magnetic field extension of previous work by Cho et al. (Phys. Rev. B 108, 235172, 2023) on microscopic calculation of shear viscosity for electron fluid in graphene system. Our calculation is based on the kinetic theory approach in the relaxation time approximation. In the absence of magnetic field, transport is governed by a single shear viscosity coefficient, whereas the application of a finite magnetic field induces anisotropy, give rise to the five independent shear viscosity coefficients associated with distinct velocity gradient tensors. These coefficient can be physically categorized into perpendicular, parallel and Hall components relative to the magnetic field direction. When the scattering time equals to the cyclotron time, the perpendicular component is suppressed by 80% and parallel component by 50%, and Hall effect can reach maximum. Corresponding magnetic field strength for electron fluid in graphene is around 0.01-0.1 Tesla and the same for non-relativistic electron fluid and ultra-relativistic quark fluid are around 10 Tesla and 10^14 Tesla respectively. They may be considered as required magnetic field strength in three different fluid systems to observe noticeable magnetic field response in their shear viscosity coefficients.

Title: Viscoelastic Material Properties of Gelatin with Varying Water to Collagen mass Ratios
Authors: Joseph E. Bonavia
Abstract: Gelatin is often used as an analog for studying soft and biological materials in order to understand the mechanics of behavior of biological tissue in events like traumatic brain injuries. The material properties of gelatin change with the ratio of water to gelatin powder used to make a given sample. Characterizing the relationship between this ratio and the material properties of gelatin is crucial to enable its use in mechanics experiments. In this work, compression tests were performed on a texture analyzer on samples which ranged from a 2:1 to 20:1 ratio of water to gelatin powder. In this range, instantaneous stiffnesses were well fit via power law in this ratio and decreased from 277 +/- 30 kPa to 4.34 +/- 0.64 kPa. The dominant (longest) timescales of the samples were well fit via a sigmoid function in this ratio and increased from 29.8 +/- 1.0 s to 621 +/- 92 s. The resulting ratio-property relationships offer a functional way to design gelatin samples for use in mechanics experiments.

Abstract: Moiré superlattices in van der Waals materials have revolutionized the study of electronic and excitonic systems by creating periodic electrostatic potentials. Extending this concept to magnetic materials promises new pathways in merging spintronics with photonics. While moiré magnetism has been revealed with near-field probes and nonlinear optical techniques, the coupling of these magnetic textures to optical excitations - magneto-moiré excitons - remains unexplored. Here, we report the observation of magneto-moiré excitons in twisted bilayer CrSBr, correlated with moiré spin textures that emerge below a critical twist angle of ~2°. The nanoscale moiré spin texture imprints distinct signatures onto the optical spectrum, shifting the exciton energy via a periodic magnetic exchange field. First-principles calculations corroborate that these signatures arise from one-dimensional spin textures governed by the balance of exchange interactions and domain wall energy. Our results demonstrate that moiré magnetism can be used to engineer nanoscale excitonic energy landscapes, providing a new platform for magneto-optical sensing, quantum transduction, and control of non-collinear magnetism and topology through light.

Title: Run and Tumble Dynamics of Biased Quantum Trajectories in a Monitored Qubit
Authors: Aritra Kundu
Abstract: We investigate the active stochastic dynamics of a qubit subjected to continuous measurement and conditional feedback. The stochastic equation governing the state vector trajectory of the qubit can be mapped, in the high-diffusion limit, to the dynamics of a classical persistent Run-and-Tumble Particle (p-RTP) in a bounded one-dimensional domain. The mapping enables us to use analytical results from classical active matter to derive an approximate non-equilibrium steady-state (NESS) distribution for the monitored quantum system. The competition between the coherent Rabi drive and the measurement-induced feedback leads to a rich NESS phase displaying Zeno--anti-Zeno transition--which is statistically equivalent to the propulsion-induced trapping observed in confined active particles.

Title: Spin noise of localized electrons in CdTe/CdMgTe quantum well
Authors: A. L. Zibinskiy, S. Cronenberger, B. Gribakin, R. Baye, D. Scalbert, R. André, D. S. Smirnov, M. Vladimirova
Abstract: The spin dynamics of localized electrons in bulk semiconductors is governed by the interplay of effective nuclear field fluctuations, spin exchange between electrons, and spin transitions into the conduction band. Using spin noise spectroscopy, we reveal this interplay for donor-bound electrons in a CdTe/CdMgTe quantum well and spectrally separate electron spin relaxation and dephasing in zero magnetic field. We identify a specific regime of the electron spin dynamics, where temperature-induced activation of spin-independent hopping leads to a monotonic acceleration of electron spin relaxation. This behavior contrasts with bulk CdTe crystals, where the motional narrowing effect is observed. We attribute this difference to the significantly larger inhomogeneous broadening of the donor-related trion resonance in our quantum well compared to bulk samples. The theoretical analysis of the spin noise power and the strength of the spin exchange interaction provides the estimation of the donor concentration in our unintentionally doped structure.

Title: Magnetic excitons in a suspended 2D antiferromagnetic membrane
Authors: Joanna L.P. Wolff, Loïc Moczko, Jérémy Thoraval, Michelangelo Romeo, Benjamin Bacq-Labreuil, Stéphane Berciaud, Arnaud Gloppe
Abstract: Layered magnetic and strongly correlated materials present a rich platform for condensed matter physics with intrinsic properties intertwined by magnetism and low-dimensionality. A suspended light-emitting 2D antiferromagnetic membrane forms a highly controllable hybrid system in which the interplay between spin ordering, optical and mechanical degrees of freedom can be uniquely explored. NiPS$_3$ hosts excitons responsible for a puzzling luminescence down to a few atomic layers, linked to its zigzag antiferromagnetic order. The nature of these excitons remains unclear. Here we report on the magnetic excitons of a suspended few-layer NiPS$_3$ membrane. We reveal nematic zigzag states and study the optical transitions induced by the magnon-mediated motion of the excitation in the magnetic lattice, resulting in magnon-dressed excitons. We observe a strain tuning of these emission lines, dependent on their microscopic origin, with rates that sign a strong localization of the magnetic excitons, fading with the number of magnon-mediated hops.

Title: Substrate and cation engineering for optimizing superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates

Abstract: In a recent experiment [Nature 642, 58 (2025)], a new record for the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ among infinite-layer nickelates has been reported in doped SmNiO$_2$. Here, we use the cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A), and qualitatively as well as quantitatively reproduce the $T_c$ vs. doping dome for this compound. Encouraged by this, we go further and identify a path towards realizing even higher $T_c$'s by changing the cation along the line Nd$\rightarrow$Sm$\rightarrow$Y$\rightarrow$Lu with matching substrates. The successively smaller cation radius allows for smaller lattice constants of the substrate. This in turn increases the in-plane hopping and thus eventually $T_c$.

Title: Cuprates, Pnictides and Sulfosalts: Lessons in Functional Materials
Authors: N. Barišić, D. K. Sunko
Abstract: Murunskite K$_2$Cu$_3$FeS$_4$ is a representative sulfosalt, isostructural to the pnictides, but with electronic properties more similar to the insulating parent compounds of the cuprates. We use it as a bridge to compare the chemical and physical roles of metal and ligand orbitals in cuprates and pnictides. In cuprates, ionicity, covalency, and metallicity are tightly interwoven to give rise to high-temperature superconductivity (SC). Their most remarkable property is the interaction of an ionically localized hole on the copper (Cu) with a Fermi liquid (FL) on the oxygens (O), which is critically important for understanding all key properties of these materials. The localization is due to strong correlations on the Cu $3d$ orbital. We describe a scenario in which the localized hole gives rise both to SC by Cooper scattering of O holes, and to Fermi arcs, as observed in cuprate spectroscopy, the latter by a purely kinematic projection of the static local disorder, without invoking any residual interactions between the mobile O FL carriers. In the pnictides, the orbitals responsible for binding and metallic conduction appear to be separate. The Fe $3d$ $e_{g}$ orbitals hybridized with the ligands set the lattice spacing. The $3d$ $t_{2g}$ orbitals overlap directly between the Fe atoms, resulting in several electronic bands appearing at the Fermi level. The ensuing Fermi liquid exhibits both charge and magnetic correlations. We argue that a similar SC scenario as in the cuprates is plausible in the pnictides, except that a light FL scatters on a slow nearly-antiferromagnetic (AF) one, rather than on localized holes as in the cuprates.

Title: The role of charge in thermodynamic uncertainty relations
Authors: David Christian Ohnmacht, Wolfgang Belzig, Juan Carlos Cuevas
Abstract: We demonstrate that the charge value of transport mechanisms heavily impacts the validity of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). Specifically, we show within the framework of full counting statistics, that the recently established quantum TUR can be violated by the presence of transport processes that carry more than one charge, like Andreev reflection processes in normal metal-superconductor junctions. We propose a modified quantum TUR, which incorporates the charge value and demonstrate that this charge-dependent quantum TUR can only be violated if the highest charge transport process exceeds this charge value. In particular, we establish that the breaking of the quantum TUR solely originates from the charge value of the highest charge transport process. Namely, our analytical considerations do not invoke the existence of superconductivity, and these considerations generally hold for non-interacting electronic transport which can be described by the scattering formalism.

Title: Comparative study of plasmons in half-filled graphene via Quantum Monte Carlo and Random Phase Approximation
Authors: Maksim Ulybyshev, Adrien Reingruber, Kitinan Pongsangangan
Abstract: Transport properties of strongly correlated materials have contributions from quasiparticle excitations such as electrons and holes as well as emerging collective excitations such as sounds and plasmons which are sustained by interactions. It was previously shown in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 205127] that thermal excitation of the long-lived plasmons in graphene provides a substantial contribution to heat and momentum transport in the interaction-dominated regime. Detailed information on these excitations is therefore necessary for the understanding of hydrodynamic transport with quantitative precision. On the other hand, dynamics of graphene plasmons is usually studied using the perturbation theory within the Dirac-cone approximation, thus neglecting the effects of a finite Brillouin zone and higher-order perturbative corrections. Both these effects can be however significant for strong-interacting systems including free-standing graphene where the effective coupling constant can reach values up to two. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the behavior of plasmons in half-filled free standing graphene using unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We confirm the existence of well-defined resonance peaks for plasmons around the $\Gamma$ point, report their dispersion and the dependence of their quasiparticle residue on momentum. Comparison with the Random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculation for the Dirac theory shows that strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone effects, automatically taken into account in QMC calculations substantially alter the results. Our findings highlight the need to account for these effects analytically when developing theories of electronic transport in free-standing graphene.

Title: Kinetic energy constructed from exact gradient expansion of second order in uniform gas limit
Authors: Abhishek Bhattacharjee, Hemanadhan Myneni, Manoj K. Harbola, Prasanjit Samal
Abstract: Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory (OFDFT) has re-emerged as a viable alternative to Kohn-Sham DFT, driven by recent advances in kinetic energy density functionals (KEDFs). Nonlocal (NL) KEDFs have significantly extended OFDFT's applicability, particularly for bulk solids, but their high computational cost and dependence of system-specific parameters limit their universality. In this work, we propose a semilocal KEDF at the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) level that achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art NL and meta-GGA functionals, while remaining entirely parameter-free. Our construction revives the Thomas-Fermi-von Weizsacker (TFvW) framework by modulating the relative contributions of TF and vW terms through physically motivated constraints and preserving the exact second-order gradient expansion. Despite its simple form, the proposed functional (KGE2) performs remarkably well across both extended systems (metals and semiconductors) and finite systems (clusters), without any need for parameter tuning. These results mark a step toward a transferable, computationally efficient, and general-purpose KEDF suitable for large-scale OFDFT simulations.

Title: Microwave Response of Superconductors with Paramagnetic Impurities
Authors: Mehdi Zarea, J. A. Sauls
Abstract: We develop theoretical methods to predict the effects of paramagnetic impurities on the microwave response of conventional spin-singlet superconductors. Our focus is on superconducting devices and resonators with low concentrations of impurities and exchange interactions with conduction electrons. We connect the sub-gap quasiparticle spectrum generated by pair-breaking to the frequency and temperature dependence of the conductivity for superconductors operating at microwave frequencies. We report theoretical results for superconducting device performance -- dissipation, quality factor and frequency shift anomalies -- based on self-consistent calculations of the current response and penetraion of the electromagnetic field at the vacuum-superconducting interface. Key results include the prediction of a non-monotonic anomaly in the low-frequency superfluid fraction and penetration depth at very low temperatures related to the sub-gap quasiparticle spectrum. Dissipation of microwave power is predicted from intra- and inter- impurity band transitions at GHz frequencies at low temperatures, including a physical mechanism responsible for residual resistance. We predict anomalies in the resonant frequency, $f(T)$, and quality factor, $Q(T)$, of high-Q SRF cavities operating in the GHz range at low-temperatures that are sensitive to non-magnetic and paramagnetic impurity disorder.

Title: Rényi-like entanglement probe of the chiral central charge
Authors: Julian Gass, Michael Levin
Abstract: We propose a ground state entanglement probe for gapped, two-dimensional quantum many-body systems that involves taking powers of reduced density matrices in a particular geometric configuration. This quantity, which we denote by $\omega_{\alpha,\beta}$, is parameterized by two positive real numbers $\alpha, \beta$, and can be seen as a ``Rényi-like" generalization of the modular commutator -- another entanglement probe proposed as a way to compute the chiral central charge from a bulk wave function. We obtain analytic expressions for $\omega_{\alpha,\beta}$ for gapped ground states of non-interacting fermion Hamiltonians as well as ground states of string-net models. In both cases, we find that $\omega_{\alpha,\beta}$ takes a universal value related to the chiral central charge. For integer values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, our quantity $\omega_{\alpha,\beta}$ can be expressed as an expectation value of permutation operators acting on an appropriate replica system, providing a natural route to measuring $\omega_{\alpha,\beta}$ in numerical simulations and potentially, experiments.

Title: Singlet Fission among two Single Molecules
Authors: Sumanta Paul, Oleksandr Yampolskyy, Zehua Wu, Klaus Müllen, Thomas Basché
Abstract: Singlet fission (SF) is a photophysical process where a singlet excitation generates two triplet excited states, enhancing exciton multiplication potentially useful for solar energy conversion. Since SF typically outcompetes radiative decay, single molecule studies of SF have remained elusive. Here, we present single molecule spectroscopy of a terrylenediimide (TDI) dimer at room and cryogenic temperatures. By analysing the stream of photons emitted by single dimers, the rates of formation and decay of SF-born triplet states were determined. We report considerable static and dynamic heterogeneities of the SF process which are reflected in broad rate distributions as well as the occasional occurrence of delayed fluorescence and rate fluctuations during spin evolution. Cryogenic experiments point to the formation of a coherent multiexciton superposition state which decays into the singlet exciton from which a correlated triplet pair evolves. Our results establish single molecule spectroscopy as a new avenue into mechanistic details of the SF process which often are drowned by ensemble av-eraging.

Title: Leakage-Aware Bandgap Prediction on the JARVIS-DFT Dataset: A Phase-Wise Feature Analysis
Authors: Gaurav Kumar Sharma
Abstract: In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the JARVIS-DFT bandgap dataset and identify and remove descriptors that may inadvertently encode band-structure information, such as effective masses. This process yields a curated, leakage-controlled subset of 2280 materials. Using this dataset, a three-phase modeling framework is implemented that incrementally incorporates basic physical descriptors, engineered features, and compositional attributes. The results show that tree-based models achieve R2 values of approximately 0.88 to 0.90 across all phases, indicating that expanding the descriptor space does not substantially improve predictive accuracy when leakage is controlled. SHAP analysis consistently identifies the dielectric tensor components as the dominant contributors. This work provides a curated dataset and baseline performance metrics for future leakage-aware bandgap prediction studies.

Title: Observation of flat-band skin effect
Authors: Xulong Wang, Dongyi Wang, Congwei Lu, Ruo-Yang Zhang, Ching Hua Lee, Kun Ding, Guancong Ma
Abstract: Symmetry-protected ideal flat bands in one-dimensional (1D) Hermitian lattices are populated by compact localized states (CLS) - a special class of localization with wavefunctions confined within a small region. In this work, we discover that the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) can appear in a flat band. Unlike conventional NHSEs for dispersive bands that are protected by nontrivial point-gap topology, the flat band remains a point on the complex-energy plane and is therefore always topologically trivial. We found that, intriguingly, the flat-band skin effect (FBSE) is associated with the non-trivial spectral topology of the dispersive bands enclosing the flat band on the complex-energy plane, so it only emerges within a finite range of non-Hermitian parameters and can counterintuitively disappear at large non-Hermiticity. Moreover, the gaps between the flat and the dispersive bands can close at higher-order exceptional points under both periodic and open boundary conditions. The flat-band wavefunctions are discontinuous in quantum distance across these exceptional points, signifying that the gap-closing is singular. The FBSE was experimentally observed in a non-Hermitian mechanical lattice. Our work reveals flat-band phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems and highlights new possibilities in quantum geometry and localization control.

Title: First results of the Tritium Absorption InfraRed Spectroscopy (T2ApIR) experiment
Authors: Alexander Marsteller, Dominic Batzler, Beate Bornschein, Lutz Bornschein, Elisabeth Eckard, Florian Hanß, Joshua Kohpeiß, Daniel Kurz, Ralph Lietzow, Michael Sturm, Tin Vrkic, Stefan Welte, Robin Größle
Abstract: The literature on experimentally verified material properties of tritium is sparse but information about this is crucial in fusion for pellet production (Magnetic Confined Fusion), target fueling (Inertial Confined Fusion), cryogenic distillation, as well as in astroparticle physics for neutrino experiments, and search for rare physics. To improve on this, the T$_2$ApIR experiment has been designed and built at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK), and is in its scientific commissioning phase. The main focus of this experiment is to enable the investigation of the properties of all six hydrogen isotopologues and their mixtures in the gaseous, liquid, and solid phase, as well as the dynamics of their phase changes. In addition, mixtures with noble gases such as xenon and neon can be investigated. This is achieved using a cryogenic setup capable of reaching less than 10 in a measurement cell that allows optical access for infrared absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and a polariscope setup, as well as temperature and pressure measurement.

Title: Rapid reduction of nitrophenols using reusable magnetic \textit{h}-BN/Ni--NiO nanocomposites
Authors: Anjali Varshney, Ritesh Dubey, Sushil Kumar, Tapas Goswami, Samar Layek
Abstract: The efficient and cost-effective conversion of nitro compounds to amines is crucial for industrial processes and environmental remediation, highlighting the growing demand for earth-abundant metal-based catalysts. In this study, magnetic Ni--NiO nanostructures and their composites with two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (\textit{h}-BN) were synthesized via a simple and scalable combustion method. The structural, morphological, and compositional properties of the synthesized materials were systematically investigated using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV--Vis spectroscopy. The catalytic activity of both Ni--NiO and \textit{h}-BN/Ni--NiO nanostructures was evaluated using nitrophenol reduction as a model reaction. The \textit{h}-BN/Ni--NiO nanocomposite exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic performance compared to pristine Ni--NiO, highlighting the synergistic interaction between \textit{h}-BN and Ni--NiO nanoparticles. Notably, the magnetic nature of the Ni--NiO core enabled facile recovery of the catalyst using an external magnetic field, and the composite demonstrated excellent stability and reusability for up to six catalytic cycles with minimal loss of activity. The combination of high catalytic efficiency, magnetic separability, and structural stability positions the \textit{h}-BN/Ni--NiO nanocomposite as a promising candidate for green and sustainable catalytic applications, particularly in environmental remediation.

Title: Validation of Quantum Computing for Transition Metal Oxide-based Automotive Catalysis
Authors: Yuntao Gu, Louis Hector Jr, Paolo Giusto, Matthew Titsworth, Alok Warey, Dnyanesh Rajpathak, Eser Atesoglu
Abstract: Quantum computing presents a promising alternative to classical computational methods for modeling strongly correlated materials with partially filled d orbitals. In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts. These findings provide a roadmap for near-term and future quantum simulations of industrially relevant catalytic materials, offering insights into the feasibility and scaling of quantum chemistry applications in materials science.

Title: Theory of Scalable Spin Squeezing with Disordered Quantum Dipoles
Authors: Avi Kaplan-Lipkin, Philip J. D. Crowley, Jonathan N. Hallén, Zilin Wang, Weijie Wu, Sabrina Chern, Chris R. Laumann, Lode Pollet, Norman Y. Yao
Abstract: Spin squeezed entanglement enables metrological precision beyond the classical limit. Understood through the lens of continuous symmetry breaking, dipolar spin systems exhibit the remarkable ability to generate spin squeezing via their intrinsic quench dynamics. To date, this understanding has primarily focused on lattice spin systems; in practice however, dipolar spin systems$\unicode{x2014}$ranging from ultracold molecules to nuclear spin ensembles and solid-state color centers$\unicode{x2014}$often exhibit significant amounts of positional disorder. Here, we develop a theory for scalable spin squeezing in a two-dimensional randomly diluted lattice of quantum dipoles, which naturally realize a dipolar XXZ model. Via extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram for finite-temperature XY order, and by extension scalable spin squeezing, as a function of both disorder and Ising anisotropy. As the disorder increases, we find that scalable spin squeezing survives only near the Heisenberg point. We show that this behavior is due to the presence of rare tightly-coupled dimers, which effectively heat the system post-quench. In the case of strongly-interacting nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we demonstrate that an experimentally feasible strategy to decouple the problematic dimers from the dynamics is sufficient to enable scalable spin squeezing.

Title: Learning transitions of topological surface codes
Authors: Finn Eckstein, Bo Han, Simon Trebst, Guo-Yi Zhu
Abstract: For the surface code, topological quantum order allows one to encode logical quantum information in a robust, long-range entangled many-body quantum state. However, if an observer probes this quantum state by performing measurements on the underlying qubits, thereby collecting an ensemble of highly correlated classical snapshots, two closely related questions arise: (i) do measurements decohere the topological order of the quantum state; and (ii) how much of the logical information can one learn from the snapshots? Here we address these questions for measurements in a uniform basis on all qubits. We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana "metal" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a "metal to insulator" transition...

Title: Ergotropy of quantum many-body scars
Authors: Zhaohui Zhi, Qingyun Qian, Jin-Guo Liu, Guo-Yi Zhu
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars break ergodicity and evade thermalization, resulting in area law entanglement entropy even with high energy density. While their quantum correlations and entanglement have been elaborated previously, their capacity in storing extractable energy, quantified by the notion ergotropy, remains an open question. Here we focus on the representative PXP model, and unveil the extensive ergotropy scaling of a family of states interpolating between quantum many-body scars and thermal states, the latter of which are known to be passive with vanishing ergotropy. A phenomenological relation between ergotropy and entanglement is uncovered, which generalizes the existing free fermion integrable results to an interacting scenario. The ergotropy in a dynamical protocol shows that a reset with a global uniform coherent rotation can inject extractable energy, as a proof of principle way to charge a quantum "battery". Our protocol is tailored for near term Rydberg neutral atoms array, while also being feasible for other quantum processors. Our results establish that quantum many-body scars, despite the tiny fraction of the Hilbert space they occupy, can be efficiently exploited for storing extractable energy, and "scarring" a many-body system as a promising route for engineering quantum many-body battery.

Title: Fundamentals of quantum Boltzmann machine learning with visible and hidden units
Authors: Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: One of the primary applications of classical Boltzmann machines is generative modeling, wherein the goal is to tune the parameters of a model distribution so that it closely approximates a target distribution. Training relies on estimating the gradient of the relative entropy between the target and model distributions, a task that is well understood when the classical Boltzmann machine has both visible and hidden units. For some years now, it has been an obstacle to generalize this finding to quantum state learning with quantum Boltzmann machines that have both visible and hidden units. In this paper, I derive an analytical expression for the gradient of the quantum relative entropy between a target quantum state and the reduced state of the visible units of a quantum Boltzmann machine. Crucially, this expression is amenable to estimation on a quantum computer, as it involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations reminiscent of those appearing in my prior work on rotated Petz recovery maps. This leads to a quantum algorithm for gradient estimation in this setting. I then specialize the setting to quantum visible units and classical hidden units, and vice versa, and provide analytical expressions for the gradients, along with quantum algorithms for estimating them. Finally, I replace the quantum relative entropy objective function with the Petz-Tsallis relative entropy; here I develop an analytical expression for the gradient and sketch a quantum algorithm for estimating it, as an application of a novel formula for the derivative of the matrix power function, which also involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations. Ultimately, this paper demarcates progress in training quantum Boltzmann machines with visible and hidden units for generative modeling and quantum state learning.

Title: Designing low-loss cavities across the band-gap of photonic crystal slabs
Authors: Nadhia Monim, Wolfgang Langbein, Francesco Masia
Abstract: Photonic crystal cavities (PCCs) are defects in host photonic crystals (PCs) which create bound states in the PC band gap. These bound states are resonant states of the electromagnetic field with a complex resonance frequency and can have very small mode volumes. PCCs are attractive for a variety of applications, from cavity quantum electrodynamics to biosensing. A PC slab geometry is advantageous given its superior manufacturability compared to three-dimensional crystals, and the accessibility of the surface allows sensing and coupling. However, the emission into the half spaces above and below the slab limits the bound state lifetime. Controlling this emission is thus crucial for applications, most of which benefiting from a long lifetime. A range of methods to find defect geometries suppressing the emission to increase the lifetime have been demonstrated in the past. However, they do not cater for a designed resonant frequency covering a wide addressable range, as needed for multiplexed devices. Here, we demonstrate a design method controlling both resonance frequency and emission, by minimising a cost function including both losses and target frequency. We show applications on PCCs in GaAs PC slabs immersed in water, relevant for biosensing. The reduced refractive index contrast in these structures compared to previously studied PCCs embedded in vacuum renders the emission suppression more challenging. We optimize the quality factor of a standard L3 cavity from 1000 to 10^4-10^5, with an addressable resonance frequency range covering 12% relative bandwidth, spanning more than half of the band gap. We furthermore report optimised structures of H1 cavities, and provide the optimisation code for widespread use.

Title: Quantum information scrambling in strongly disordered Rydberg spin systems
Authors: Maximilian Müllenbach, Sebastian Geier, Adrian Braemer, Eduard Braun, Titus Franz, Gerhard Zürn, Matthias Weidemüller, Martin Gärttner
Abstract: Despite the fact that power-law interactions occur in a plethora of physical systems, their many-body dynamics is far less understood than that of nearest-neighbor interacting systems. Here, we study information scrambling in strongly disordered spin systems with power-law interactions via out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs). Numerically, we find pronounced differences in the dynamical spreading of OTOCs between nearest-neighbor and power-law interacting systems. This deviation persists even for short-range interactions, opposing the common view that these interactions produce dynamics equivalent to the nearest-neighbor case. In a detailed experimental proposal, tailored but not limited to Rydberg tweezer setups, we present a protocol to extract OTOCs in XXZ Heisenberg spin systems with tunable anisotropy and programmable disorder based on currently available techniques.

Title: The relation between classical and quantum Lyapunov exponent and the bound on chaos in classically chaotic quantum systems
Authors: Fabian Haneder, Gerrit Caspari, Juan Diego Urbina, Klaus Richter
Abstract: Out-of-Time-Ordered Commutators (OTOCs), representing a key diagnostic for scrambling as a facet of short-time quantum chaos, have attracted wide-ranging interest, from many-body physics to quantum gravity. By means of a suitable form of the Wigner-Moyal expansion, and invoking ensemble equivalence in statistical physics, we provide a consistent approach to the growth rate of the OTOC for many-body systems with chaotic classical limit where both the classical Lyapunov exponent and the quantum nature of the density of states enter. Applying this construction to quantized high-dimensional hyperbolic motion, i.e., a quantum chaotic system that exhibits gravity-like correlation functions in the late-time regime, we compute the OTOC growth rate $\Lambda$ as a function of the number of degrees of freedom, $f$, and inverse temperature, $\beta$. We show that the scaled growth rate, $\Lambda/f$, can be described by a universal function of $f \beta$ and displays a cross-over from classical to quantum behavior as we increase $f$ and/or lower the temperature. In the deep quantum regime of infinite $f$, we find maximally fast scrambling in the sense of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound on chaos. This elucidates the non-perturbative mechanism underlying the saturation of the bound via quantum contributions to the mean density of states, and it provides further support for this dynamical system as a dual to two-dimensional quantum gravity. In this way, we present first evidence of maximally fast scrambling in a quantum chaotic system with a well-defined classical Hamiltonian limit, without invoking any external mechanism such as (disorder) averaging.

Title: Entanglement of General Subregions in Time-Dependent States
Authors: Wu-zhong Guo, Song He, Tao Liu
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for computing Rényi and entanglement entropies of arbitrary spacetime intervals in time-dependent states of $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theories. By combining the spacetime density matrix formalism with the replica method, we show that entanglement entropy is well defined for both spacelike and timelike separations. Applying this framework to global quenches prepared by boundary states and to local quenches generated by operator insertions, we obtain analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy in general spacetime configurations. The results reveal qualitative differences between spacelike and timelike intervals: the timelike entanglement entropy is time-independent in the global quench model, depends solely on the temporal separation, and universally exhibits a constant imaginary contribution. These features are naturally explained by a generalized quasiparticle picture in which entanglement is produced precisely when one worldline of each quasiparticle pair intersects the interval. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linear sum rule relating time- and spacelike entanglement persists in both global and local quenches, indicating a broader universality of spacetime entanglement in real-time quantum dynamics.

Title: Fabrication, drug delivery kinetics and cell viability assay of PLGA-coated vancomycin-loaded silicate porous microspheres
Authors: N. Zirak, A. Maadani, E. Salahinejad, N. Abbasnezhad, M. Shirinbayan
Abstract: Porous ceramic microspheres are a desirable substance for bone tissue reconstruction and delivery applications. This study focuses on Mg-Ca silicate microspheres encapsulated in biodegradable poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to serve as a biocompatible carrier for the controlled release of vancomycin hydrochloride. In this regard, diopside (MgCaSi2O6), bredigite (MgCa7Si4O16) and akermanite (MgCa2Si2O7) powders were synthesized by sol-gel and subsequent calcination methods. Then, porous akermanite, diopside and bredigite microspheres of 700-1000 um in diameter were fabricated by using carbon porogen, droplet extrusion and sintering, then loaded with the drug and eventually coated with PLGA. The bare microspheres showed a considerable burst release mode of the drug into a physiological medium, whereas PLGA coating of the microspheres reduced the burst release level. To investigate effective mechanisms governing in the drug release from the carriers, the contribution of burst, degradation, and diffusion was analyzed by the sequential quadratic programming algorithm method. It was found that the relative contribution of diffusion to bioresorption is ranked as diopside > akermanite > bredigite, whereas PLGA coating dominates the diffusion mechanism. The dental pulp stem cells cytocompatibility MTT assay of the microspheres also showed that the drug loading deteriorates but PLGA coating improves the cell biocompatibility significantly. Comparatively, the biocompatibility of the PLGA-coated microspheres was ranked as akermanite > diopside > bredigite, as a result of a compromise between the release of the constituting ions of the ceramic carriers and vancomycin molecules. It was eventually concluded that PLGA-coated Mg-Ca silicate microspheres are promising candidates for drug-delivery bone tissue engineering and dental bone grafting applications.

Title: Disorder-induced broadening of quantum momentum distribution
Authors: Vili Heinonen, Jani Lukkarinen
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of a non-interacting two-dimensional quantum gas in a weak random potential with long-range correlations. Any peaked initial momentum distribution will eventually become isotropic and broaden due to scattering events with the random potential. We derive an expression for the long-time average of the momentum distribution and test it against computer simulations. We also discuss momentum isotropization and spatial diffusion.

Title: Deterministic exciton confinement in 2D semiconductors via local dielectric engineering for scalable quantum light sources
Authors: Raziel Itzhak, Alex Hayat, Ilya Goykhman
Abstract: Single-photon emitters are essential building blocks for quantum communication and photonic quantum technologies. However, realizing scalable, on-chip SPEs on a CMOS-compatible platform remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose and theoretically demonstrate a scalable approach to exciton confinement in two-dimensional semiconductors via local dielectric engineering. By introducing a high-dielectric-constant nanopillar above or beneath the 2D material, we create a spatially varying dielectric environment that can support localized exciton states, enabling deterministic, lithography-compatible single-photon emission without relying on strain, defects, or etching of the 2D layer. Using numerical solutions to the 2D excitonic Schrodinger equation, we quantify the resulting confinement through binding energies, wavefunction profiles, and a spatial confinement parameter. These results offer a practical and scalable route for integrating 2D-based quantum emitters into photonic platforms, paving the way for next-generation quantum optoelectronic devices.

Title: Quantum Geometric Tensor in the Wild: Resolving Stokes Phenomena via Floquet-Monodromy Spectroscopy
Authors: Prasoon Saurabh
Abstract: Standard topological invariants, such as the Chern number and Berry phase, form the bedrock of modern quantum matter classification. However, we demonstrate that this framework undergoes a \textbf{catastrophic failure} in the presence of essential singularities -- ubiquitous in open, driven, and non-Hermitian systems ("Wild" regime). In these settings, the local geometric tensor diverges, rendering standard invariants ill-defined and causing perturbative predictions to deviate from reality by order unity ($\sim 100\%$). We resolve this crisis by introducing the \textbf{Floquet-Monodromy Spectroscopy (FMS)} protocol, a pulse-level control sequence, which experimentally extracts the hidden \textit{Stokes Phenomenon} -- the "missing" geometric data that completes the topological description. By mapping the singularity's Stokes multipliers to time-domain observables, FMS provides a rigorous experimental bridge to \textbf{Resurgence Theory}, allowing for the exact reconstruction of non-perturbative physics from divergent asymptotic series. We validate this framework on a superconducting qudit model, demonstrating that the "Stokes Invariant" serves as the next-generation quantum number for classifying phases of matter beyond the reach of conventional topology.

Title: Non-Hermitian Exceptional Topology on a Klein Bottle Photonic Circuit
Authors: Ze-Sheng Xu, J. Lukas K. König, Andrea Cataldo, Rohan Yadgirkar, Govind Krishna, Venkatesh Deenadayalan, Val Zwiller, Stefan Preble, Emil J. Bergholtz, Jun Gao, Ali W. Elshaari
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has unlocked a wealth of unconventional wave phenomena beyond the reach of Hermitian systems, with exceptional points (EPs) driving enhanced sensitivity, nonreciprocal transport, and topological behavior unique to non-Hermitian degeneracies. Here, we present a scalable and reconfigurable silicon photonic integrated circuit capable of emulating arbitrary non-Hermitian time evolution with high precision. Using this programmable platform, we implement a two-band non-Hermitian Hamiltonian defined on a Klein-bottle topology a nonorientable parameter space that enables exceptional phases forbidden on orientable manifolds. Through an on-chip amplitude-and-phase reconstruction protocol, we retrieve the full complex Hamiltonian at multiple points in parameter space and experimentally map the associated Fermi arc where the imaginary eigenvalue gap closes. The orientation of the measured Fermi arc reveals a nontrivial exceptional topology: it implies the presence of same-charge EPs (or an EP monopole) that cannot annihilate locally on the Klein bottle. Our results demonstrate the first photonic realization of exceptional topology on a nonorientable manifold and establish a versatile platform for exploring exotic non-Hermitian and topological models relevant to classical and quantum photonics.

Title: Towards compressed baryonic matter densities: thermodynamics and transport coefficients
Authors: Anand Rai, Dani Rose J Marattukalam, Prasanta Murmu, Ashutosh Dwibedi, Rishabh Sharma, Sabyasachi Ghosh
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic and transport properties of hot and dense quantum chromodynamic matter expected to be produced in low-energy heavy-ion collisions, using three different effective quantum chromodynamic frameworks: the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, the chiral effective model, and the hadron resonance gas model. We briefly outline the theoretical formulation of thermodynamic quantities and transport coefficients within these approaches, where quarks are treated with effective masses in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio and chiral effective models, and hadronic degrees of freedom are employed in the hadron resonance gas model. The transport coefficients are evaluated using the Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation-time approximation. Following the theoretical overview, we present a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of these quantities as functions of the baryon chemical potential or net baryon density. The Lorenz ratio $\kappa/(\sigma T)$ is found to increase rapidly-indicating a strong violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the low-$\mu_{B}$ regime--while approaching the universal value at higher baryon chemical potentials or densities. The shear-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio $\eta/s$ remains nearly constant at low $\mu_{B}$ but exhibits a gradual increase as $\mu_{B}$ grows. We also discuss the qualitative similarities of these trends with those observed in the electron-hole plasma of graphene, an emergent quasi-relativistic system characterized by massless energy-momentum dispersion.

Title: Entropy of matter on the Carroll geometry
Authors: Saurav Samanta, Bibhas Ranjan Majhi
Abstract: Two prescriptions, the expansion of near horizon of geometry and expansion of metric with zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$ (speed of light in vacuum), of constructing Carroll geometries are known to complement each other. The entropy of an ideal gas, confined in a box and kept very near to the horizon, depends on the transverse area of the container. We show this by using the Carroll geometry constructed through the expansion of the metric and then taking zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$. Therefore the present analysis re-assures the complementing nature of two ways of finding the Carroll geometry from the thermodynamical point of view.

Title: Finite-Temperature Thermally-Assisted-Occupation Density Functional Theory, Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics, and Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics Methods
Authors: Shaozhi Li, Jeng-Da Chai
Abstract: Recently, thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT) [J.-D. Chai, J. Chem. Phys. 136, 154104 (2012)] has been demonstrated to be an efficient and accurate electronic structure method for studying the ground-state properties of large multi-reference (MR) systems at absolute zero. To explore the thermal equilibrium properties of large MR systems at finite electronic temperatures, in the present work, we propose the finite-temperature (FT) extension of TAO-DFT, denoted as FT-TAO-DFT. Besides, to unlock the dynamical information of large MR systems at finite temperatures, FT-TAO-DFT is combined with ab initio molecular dynamics, leading to FT-TAO-AIMD. In addition, we also develop FT-TAO-DFT-based quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), denoted as FT-TAO-QM/MM, to provide a cost-effective description of the thermal equilibrium properties of a QM subsystem with MR character embedded in an MM environment at finite temperatures. Moreover, the FT-TAO-DFT, FT-TAO-AIMD, and FT-TAO-QM/MM methods are employed to explore the radical nature and infrared (IR) spectra of n-acenes (n = 2--6), consisting of n linearly fused benzene rings, in vacuum and in an argon (Ar) matrix at finite temperatures. According to our calculations, for n-acenes at 1000 K or below, the electronic temperature effects on the radical nature and IR spectra are very minor, while the nuclear temperature effects on these properties are noticeable. For n-acene in an Ar matrx at absolute zero, the Ar matrix has minimal impact on the radical nature of n-acene, while the co-deposition procedure of n-acene and Ar atoms may affect the IR spectrum of n-acene.

Title: Profusion of Symmetry-Protected Qubits from Stable Ergodicity Breaking
Authors: Thomas Iadecola, Rahul Nandkishore
Abstract: We show how combining a discrete symmetry with topological Hilbert space fragmentation can give rise to exponentially many topologically stable qubits protected by a single discrete symmetry. We illustrate this explicitly with the example of the $\mathsf{CZ}_p$ model, where the encoded qubits are stable to arbitrary symmetry-respecting perturbations for parametrically long times, substantially enhancing the robustness of a recently proposed construction based on nontopological fragmentation. In this model, the encoded qubits naturally come in pairs for which a universal set of transversal logical gates can be performed, ruling out (by the Eastin-Knill theorem) the possibility of using them for quantum error correction. We also comment on the combination of symmetry enrichment and topological fragmentation more generally, and the implications for use of systems exhibiting Hilbert space fragmentation as quantum memories.

Title: On the Hartree-Fock phase diagram for the two-dimensional Hubbard model
Authors: Christophe Charlier, Edwin Langmann, Jonatan Lenells
Abstract: We propose an analytical method for the construction of Hartree-Fock phase diagrams for the (fermion) Hubbard model and various generalizations thereof. Such phase diagrams are traditionally constructed numerically, but we argue that, by using asymptotic techniques, it is possible to obtain analytic formulas approximating the curves separating the different phases to very high accuracy. To illustrate the new method, we apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice at zero temperature. This yields formulas for the Hartree-Fock phase boundaries that agree with, but also improve on, earlier numerical results. In particular, our results provide the first rigorous proof of the existence of mixed phases in this model.

Title: How fast can a liquid metal drop respond to a time-dependent electrocapillary excitation?
Authors: Javier Otero Martinez, Ana Garcia Armada, Yi Li, Christian Nijhuis, Javier Rodríguez-Rodríguez
Abstract: Gallium alloys are promising materials in biomedical engineering, electronics, and wireless communications, thanks to their good conductivity, non toxicity and their ability to sustain large deformations. They can be transported in capillaries using purely electric means by continuous electrowetting (CEW). Current models of CEW-driven flows do not address the transient response to fast changes in the excitation, crucial in many applications. Here, we present a theory that describes the CEW-driven oscillatory motion of a drop of Eutectic Gallium-Indium alloy inside a capillary. We consider inertia, viscosity and the transient response of the electrical circuit consisting of the drop plus the electrolyte where it is immersed. The theory describes fairly well the experimental drop velocity and explains the existence of an optimal frequency that maximizes the velocity.

Title: Random Stinespring superchannel: converting channel queries into dilation isometry queries
Authors: Filippo Girardi, Francesco Anna Mele, Haimeng Zhao, Marco Fanizza, Ludovico Lami
Abstract: The recently introduced random purification channel, which converts $n$ copies of an arbitrary mixed quantum state into $n$ copies of the same uniformly random purification, has emerged as a powerful tool in quantum information theory. Motivated by this development, we introduce a channel-level analogue, which we call the random Stinespring superchannel. This consists in a procedure to transform $n$ parallel queries of an arbitrary quantum channel into $n$ parallel queries of the same uniformly random Stinespring isometry, via universal encoding and decoding operations that are efficiently implementable. When the channel is promised to have Choi rank at most $r$, the procedure can be tailored to yield a Stinespring environment of dimension $r$. As a consequence, quantum channel learning reduces to isometry learning, yielding a simple channel learning algorithm, based on existing isometry learning protocols, that matches the performance of the two recently proposed channel tomography algorithms. Complementarily, whereas the optimality of these algorithms had previously been established only up to a logarithmic factor in the dimension, we close this gap by removing this logarithmic factor from the lower bound. Taken together, our results fully establish the optimality of these recently introduced channel learning algorithms, showing that the optimal query complexity of learning a quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ is $\Theta(d_A d_B r)$.

Title: Coexistence of distinct Discrete Time-Crystalline orders in the Floquet Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model
Authors: Shashank Mishra, Sayan Choudhury
Abstract: We examine the distinct discrete time crystals (DTCs) that emerge in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, subjected to spatially nonuniform periodic driving. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that by appropriately tailoring the drive protocol, distinct DTC orders can be realized in different spatial regions of the system. Consequently, the system exhibits spatially varying sub-harmonic responses with distinct frequencies. We employ a semi-classical analysis to establish the stability of these co-existing DTC orders in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we establish the stability of the stability of these co-existing DTCs in the presence of quantum fluctuations. Our results establish spatially structured driving as a powerful route to engineer novel forms of time-crystalline order.

Title: Tunably realizing flat-bands and exceptional points in kinetically frustrated systems: An example on the non-Hermitian Creutz ladder
Authors: Debashish Dutta, Sayan Choudhury
Abstract: We study a non-Hermitian extension of the Creutz ladder with generic non-reciprocal hopping. By mapping the ladder onto two decoupled non-Hermitian Su--Schrieffer--Heeger (SSH) chains, we uncover a rich structure in parameter space under different boundary conditions. Under periodic boundary conditions, the spectrum admits a fine-tuned line in parameter space with entirely real eigenvalues, while deviations from this line induce a real--complex spectral transition without crossing exceptional points. In contrast, an exact analytical diagonalization under open boundary conditions reveals extended regions in parameter space with purely real or purely imaginary spectra, separated from complex spectral domains by exceptional lines. The intersections of these exceptional lines define triple-junction points where distinct spectral regimes meet, giving rise to a structured phase diagram that is absent under periodic boundary conditions. We further show that flat bands in this system can occur both as Hermitian diabolical points and as non-Hermitian exceptional points, known as exceptional flat bands, where the dynamics is more stringent than in the Hermitian case, leading to distinct spectral and dynamical signatures.

Title: Revealing the Electronic Structure of van der Waals Antiferromagnetic NiPS$_3$ through Synchrotron-Based $μ$-ARPES and Alkali Metal Dosing
Authors: Yifeng Cao, Qishuo Tan, Yucheng Guo, Clóvis Guerim Vieira, Mário S. C. Mazzon, Jude Laverock, Nicholas Russo, Hongze Gao, Chris Jozwiak, Aaron Bostwick, Eli Rotenberg, Jinghua Guo, Ming Yi, Matheus J. S. Matos, Xi Ling, Kevin E. Smith
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the band structure in NiPS$_3$, a van der Waals layered antiferromagnet, utilizing high-resolution synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and corroborative density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By tuning the parameters of the light source, we obtained a very clear and wide energy range band structure of NiPS$_3$. Comparison with DFT calculations allows for the identification of the orbital character of the observed bands. Our DFT calculations perfectly match the experimental results, and no adaptations were made to the calculations based on the experimental outcomes. The appearance of novel electronic structure upon alkali metal dosing (AMD) were also obtained in this ARPES study. Above valence band maximum, structure of conduction bands and bands from defect states were firstly observed in NiPS$_3$. We provide the direct determination of the band gap of NiPS$_3$ as 1.3 eV from the band structure by AMD. In addition, detailed temperature dependent ARPES spectra were obtained across a range that spans both below and above the Néel transition temperature of NiPS$_3$. We found that the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic states have almost identical spectra, indicating the highly localized nature of Ni $d$ states.

Title: Consistent time reversal and reliable and accurate inference in the presence of memory
Authors: Tassilo Schwarz, Anatoly B. Kolomeisky, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: Thermodynamic inference from coarse observations remains a key challenge. Memory, in particular correlations between consecutively observed mesostates, blur signatures of irreversibility and must be accounted for in defining physical time-reversal, which remains an open problem. We derive an experimentally accessible k-th order estimator for the entropy production rate. Using novel measure-theoretic techniques we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for guaranteed lower bounds on the dissipation even in the strongly non-Markovian setting. The proof reveals that estimators saturated in the order unravel the duration of memory which needs to be considered in defining physically consistent time-reversal. We show that Markovian estimators in absence of a time-scale separation lead to artifacts, which convey no physical meaning. Similarly, estimators not saturated in the order may overestimate the dissipation. The necessity of correctly accounting for memory in thermodynamic inference from strongly non-Markovian observations underscores the still underappreciated challenges and intricacies in defining and understanding irreversibility in presence of memory. Our results will hopefully stimulate experiments systematically considering thermodynamic inference on multiple scales consistently accounting for memory.

Title: Band-gap reduction and band alignments of dilute bismide III--V alloys
Authors: Abdul Saboor, Shoaib Khalid, Anderson Janotti
Abstract: Adding a few atomic percent of Bi to III--V semiconductors leads to significant changes in their electronic structure and optical properties. Bismuth substitution on the pnictogen site leads to a large increase in spin-orbit splitting $\Delta_{\rm SO}$ at the top of the valence band ($\Gamma_{8v}-\Gamma_{7v}$) and a large reduction in the band gap, creating unique opportunities in semiconductor device applications. Quantifying these changes is key to the design and simulation of electronic and optoelectronic devices. Using hybrid functional calculations, we predict the band gap of III--Vs (III=Al, Ga, In and V=As, Sb) with low concentrations of Bi (3.125\% and 6.25\%), the effects of adding Bi on the valence- and conduction-band edges, and the band offset between these dilute alloys and their III--V parent compounds. As expected, adding Bi raises the valence-band maximum (VBM). However, contrary to previous assumptions, the conduction-band minimum (CBM) is also significantly lowered, and both effects contribute to the sizable band-gap reduction. Changes in band gap and $\Delta_{\rm SO}$ are notably larger in the arsenides than in the antimonides. We also predict cases of band-gap inversion ($\Gamma_{6c}$ below $\Gamma_{8v}$) and $\Delta_{\rm SO}$ larger than the band gap, which are key parameters for designing topological materials and for minimizing losses due to Auger recombination in infrared lasers.

Title: Dynamical phase transitions in certain non-ergodic stochastic processes
Authors: Yogeesh Reddy Yerrababu, Satya N. Majumdar, Benjamin Guiselin, Tridib Sadhu
Abstract: We present a class of stochastic processes in which the large deviation functions of time-integrated observables exhibit singularities that relate to dynamical phase transitions of trajectories. These illustrative examples include Brownian motion with a death rate or in the presence of an absorbing wall, for which we consider a set of empirical observables such as the net displacement, local time, residence time, and area under the trajectory. Using a backward Fokker-Planck approach, we derive the large deviation functions of these observables, and demonstrate how singularities emerge from a competition between survival and diffusion. Furthermore, we analyse this scenario using an alternative approach with tilted operators, showing that at the singular point, the effective dynamics undergoes an abrupt transition. Extending this approach, we show that similar transitions may generically arise in Markov chains with transient states. This scenario is robust and generalizable for non-Markovian dynamics and for many-body systems, potentially leading to multiple dynamical phase transitions. We have confirmed most of our findings on the singular large-deviation function using rare-event simulation techniques.

Title: Exciton-polariton condensate in the van der Waals magnet CrSBr

Abstract: Van der Waals magnets are an emergent material class of paramount interest for fundamental studies in coupling light with matter excitations, which are uniquely linked to their underlying magnetic properties. Among these materials, the semiconducting magnet CrSBr is possibly a first playground where we can study simultaneously the interaction of photons, magnons, and excitons at the quantum level. Here we demonstrate a coherent macroscopic quantum phase, the bosonic condensation of exciton-polaritons, emerging in a CrSBr flake embedded in a fully tunable cryogenic open optical cavity. The Bose condensate is characterized by a highly non-linear threshold-like behavior, and coherence manifests distinctly via its first and second order quantum correlations. We find that the condensate's non-linearity is highly susceptible to the magnetic order in CrSBr. Specially, it can encounter a sign change from attractive to repulsive interactions when the intrinsic antiferromagnetic order transforms to the forced ferromagnetic order. Our findings open a route towards magnetically controllable quantum fluids of light, and optomagnonic devices where spin magnetism is coupled to on-chip Bose-Einstein condensates.

Title: Competing effect of disorder on phase separation in active systems
Authors: Pratikshya Jena, Shambhavi Dikshit, Shradha Mishra
Abstract: We investigate the impact of random pinned disorder on a collection of self propelled particles. To achieve this, we construct a continuum model by formulating the coupled hydrodynamic equations for slow variables, local density and momentum density of particles. The disorder in the system acts as pinning sites, effectively immobilizing the particles that come into contact with them. Our numerical results reveal that weak disorder leads to phase separation in the system at density and activity lower than the typical values for motility induced phase separation. We construct a phase diagram using numerical simulations as well as linearized approximation in the plane of activity and packing fraction of particles at weak disorder densities. On increasing disorder density the system shows the Micro phase separation, while at large disorder densities, the system becomes heterogeneous and eventually undergoes kinetic arrest. The structure factor tail deviates from the Porods law, indicating increased roughness at domain interfaces under strong disorder. Furthermore, we analyze the fractal dimension of the interface as a function of disorder density, highlighting the increasing irregularity of phase separated domains. We also found that disorder significantly suppresses number fluctuations in the system.

Title: Nonreciprocal wave-mediated interactions power a classical time crystal
Authors: Mia C. Morrell, Leela Elliott, David G. Grier
Abstract: An acoustic standing wave acts as a lattice of evenly spaced potential energy wells for sub-wavelength-scale objects. Trapped particles interact with each other by exchanging waves that they scatter from the standing wave. Unless the particles have identical scattering properties, their wave-mediated interactions are nonreciprocal. Pairs of particles can use this nonreciprocity to harvest energy from the wave to sustain steady-state oscillations despite viscous drag and the absence of periodic driving. We show in theory and experiment that a minimal system composed of two acoustically levitated particles can access four distinct dynamical states, two of which are emergently active steady states. Under some circumstances, these emergently active steady states break spatiotemporal symmetry and therefore constitute a classical time crystal.

Title: Hydrodynamic fields in fluctuating environment: a model for isochoric heat capacity of simple liquids
Authors: I. P. de Freitas, F. Sobrero, A. M. S. Macedo, N. F. Svaiter
Abstract: Using functional methods, we investigate the sound quanta arising from quantized hydrodynamic fields in simple liquids at low temperatures, under the influence of high-energy processes, coming from non-hydrodynamic degrees of freedom. To model these effects on the hydrodynamic fields, we assume that the quantum fields are coupled to an additive, delta-correlated (in space and time) quantum noise field. Thus, the hydrodynamic fields are defined in a fluctuating environment. After defining the generating functional of connected correlation functions in the presence of the noise field, we perform a functional integral over all noise field configurations. This is done using a formal object inspired by the distributional zeta-function method, called the configurational zeta-function. We obtain a new generating functional written in terms of an analytically tractable functional series. This formalism allow us to obtain the excitation spectra of liquids. In the liquid, each term of the series describes the emergent non-interacting elementary excitations with the usual phonon-like dispersion relation and additional excitations with dispersion relations with gaps in pseudo-momentum space. Finally, the behavior of the constant volume specific heat as a function of temperature is obtained for different simple liquids.

Title: The Physics of Local Optimization in Complex Disordered Systems
Authors: Mutian Shen, Gerardo Ortiz, Zhiqiao Dong, Martin Weigel, Zohar Nussinov
Abstract: Limited resources motivate decomposing large-scale problems into smaller,``local" subsystems and stitching together the so-found solutions. We explore the physics underlying this approach and discuss the concept of ``local hardness", i.e., the complexity of predicting local properties of the solution from local information, for the ground-state problem of both P- and NP-hard spin-glasses and related frustrated spin systems. Depending on the model considered, we observe varying scaling behaviors in how errors associated with local predictions decay as a function of the size of the solved subsystem. These errors are intimately connected to global critical threshold instabilities, characterized by gapless, avalanche-like excitations that follow scale-invariant size distributions. Away from criticality, local solvers quickly achieve high accuracy, aligning closely with the results of the computationally much more expensive global minimization. We leverage these findings to introduce a heuristic contraction-based algorithm for globally studying spin-glass ground states. The local solvers further display sharp imprints of the phase transition from the spin-glass to the ferromagnetic phase as the distribution of spin-glass couplings is shifted, as well as characteristic differences for the infinite-range model, implying the existence of specific classes of local hardness. Our findings shed light on how Nature may operate solely through local actions at her disposal.

Title: Bridging constrained random-phase approximation and linear response theory for computing Hubbard parameters
Authors: Alberto Carta, Iurii Timrov, Sophie Beck, Claude Ederer
Abstract: The predictive accuracy of popular extensions to density-functional theory (DFT) such as DFT+U and DFT plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) hinges on using realistic values for the screened Coulomb interaction U. Here, we present a systematic comparison of the two most widely used approaches to compute this parameter, i.e. linear response theory (LRT) and the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA), using a unified framework based on the use of maximally localized Wannier functions. We show that the U in LRT and cRPA can differ as much as 30%. We demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from two main differences: neglecting the response of the exchange-correlation potential in cRPA and additional excitation channels in LRT. By taking these differences into account, we can achieve near perfect agreement between the two techniques. Moreover, we show that in cases with strong hybridization between interacting and screening subspaces, the application of cRPA becomes ambiguous and can lead to unrealistically small U values, while LRT remains well-behaved. Our work formally connects both methods, sheds light on their strengths and limitations, and emphasizes the importance of using a consistent set of Wannier orbitals to ensure transferability of U values between different implementations.

Title: Functional approach to superfluid stiffness: Role of quantum geometry in unconventional superconductivity
Authors: Maximilian Buthenhoff, Tobias Holder, Michael M. Scherer
Abstract: Nontrivial quantum geometry of electronic bands has been argued to facilitate superconductivity even for the case of flat dispersions where the conventional contribution to the superfluid weight is suppressed by the large effective mass. However, most previous work focused on the case of conventional superconductivity while many contemporary superconducting quantum materials are expected to host unconventional pairing. Here, we derive a generalized expression for the superfluid weight employing mean-field BCS theory for systems with time-reversal symmetry in the normal state and arbitrary unconventional superconducting order with zero-momentum intraband pairing. Our derivation reveals the necessity of incorporating functional derivatives of the grand potential with respect to the superconducting gap function. Through perturbative analysis in the isolated narrow-bands limit, we demonstrate that this contribution arises from quantum geometrical effects, specifically due to a nontrivial Wilczek-Zee connection. Utilizing the newly obtained expressions for the superfluid weight, we apply our framework to an extended Kane-Mele model, contrasting conventional $s$-wave superconductivity with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.

Title: Pressure induced evolution of anisotropic superconductivity and Fermi surface nesting in a ternary boride
Authors: Subhajit Pramanick, Sudip Chakraborty, A. Taraphder
Abstract: Using Migdal-Eliashberg theory implemented in Electron Phonon Wannier (EPW) code, we have investigated anisotropic superconductivity in a ternary boride $\mathrm{Ta(MoB)_2}$. It is a single-gap, anisotropic, phonon-mediated superconductor having a critical temperature $\mathrm{T_c}\sim \, 19.3$ K. A dominant contribution to superconductivity arises from the robust coupling between electronic states, primarily created by the $\mathrm{d_{xy}}$,$\mathrm{d_{x^2 - y^2}}$ orbitals of Mo atoms and the in-plane vibrations of Mo atoms. A weak Fermi surface nesting and a small electron-phonon coupling cannot induce charge density wave-like instabilities, as evidenced by the lack of a significant peak in the real part of the total Lindhard susceptibility and the absence of phonon softening. Furthermore, we have studied its electronic and superconducting properties under hydrostatic pressure up to 76.69 GPa, owing to its low bulk modulus and metastability. The persistent reduction in the density of states at the Fermi level, Fermi surface nesting and the stiffening of phonon modes lead to a diminution of superconductivity under pressure up to 59.71 GPa. At 76.69 GPa, a modification in the topology of the Fermi surface, namely a Lifshitz transition, occurs resulting in a sudden enhancement of nesting. This enhanced nesting, in turn, induces an abrupt stabilisation of superconductivity at 76.69 GPa, resulting in a V-shaped response to pressure.

Title: Diffusion with stochastic resetting on a lattice
Authors: Alexander K. Hartmann, Satya N. Majumdar
Abstract: We provide an exact formula for the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to a target at the origin for a single particle diffusing on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic {\em lattice} starting from a fixed initial position $\vec R_0$ and resetting to $\vec R_0$ with a rate $r$. Previously known results in the continuous space are recovered in the scaling limit $r\to 0$, $R_0=|\vec R_0|\to \infty$ with the product $\sqrt{r}\, R_0$ fixed. However, our formula is valid for any $r$ and any $\vec R_0$ that enables us to explore a much wider region of the parameter space that is inaccessible in the continuum limit. For example, we have shown that the MFPT, as a function of $r$ for fixed $\vec R_0$, diverges in the two opposite limits $r\to 0$ and $r\to \infty$ with a unique minimum in between, provided the starting point is not a nearest neighbour of the target. In this case, the MFPT diverges as a power law $\sim r^{\phi}$ as $r\to \infty$, but very interestingly with an exponent $\phi= (|m_1|+|m_2|+\ldots +|m_d|)-1$ that depends on the starting point $\vec R_0= a\, (m_1,m_2,\ldots, m_d)$ where $a$ is the lattice spacing and $m_i$'s are integers. If, on the other hand, the starting point happens to be a nearest neighbour of the target, then the MFPT decreases monotonically with increasing $r$, approaching a universal limiting value $1$ as $r\to \infty$, indicating that the optimal resetting rate in this case is infinity. We provide a simple physical reason and a simple Markov-chain explanation behind this somewhat unexpected universal result. Our analytical predictions are verified in numerical simulations on lattices up to $50$ dimensions. Finally, in the absence of a target, we also compute exactly the position distribution of the walker in the nonequlibrium stationary state that also displays interesting lattice effects not captured by the continuum theory.

Title: Apparent inconsistency between Streda formula and Hall conductivity in reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$
Authors: Yi Huang, Seth Musser, Jihang Zhu, Yang-Zhi Chou, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported by F. Xu, arXiv.2504.06972 which display a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble or Wigner crystal phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at filling $\nu = -0.63$, F. Xu et al. report that the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope, necessitating a different interpretation. We propose and substantiate with analysis of the experimental data that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi-surface topology and a metallic phase with a non quantized Hall response. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have a valley-imbalanced metal parent state.

Title: Dynamical and structural properties of an absorbing phase transition: a case study from granular systems
Authors: Raphael Maire, Andrea Plati, Frank Smallenburg, Giuseppe Foffi
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical and structural properties of absorbing phase transitions (APTs) within granular systems. Specifically, we examine a model for vibrofluidized systems of spherical grains, which undergo a transition from a state of purely vertical motion to one characterized by horizontal diffusion as the density increases. Numerical simulations reveal that, depending on the specific system parameters, both continuous and discontinuous transitions can occur, each associated with markedly distinct structural properties at the transition point. We explain this using a theoretical analysis based on kinetic theory applied to an effective 2D model, which elucidates the role of a synchronization effect in determining the nature of the transition. A fluctuating hydrodynamic theory, which quantitatively describes the structural and dynamical properties of the active state such as hyperuniformity is derived from the microscopic dynamics, together with an equilibrium-like assumption concerning the noises on the hydrodynamic fields. This work expands on previous studies by providing a comprehensive examination of the APT characteristics and proposing new theoretical models to interpret the observed behaviors.

Title: Surprisingly High Redundancy in Electronic Structure Data
Authors: Sazzad Hossain, Ponkrshnan Thiagarajan, Shashank Pathrudkar, Stephanie Taylor, Abhijeet S. Gangan, Amartya S. Banerjee, Susanta Ghosh
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic structure underpins advances in chemistry, materials science, and condensed matter physics. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has enabled the development of powerful surrogate models that can enable the prediction of the ground state electron density and related properties at a fraction of the computational cost of conventional first principles simulations. Such ML models typically rely on massive datasets generated through expensive Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory calculations. A key reason for relying on such large datasets is the lack of prior knowledge about which portions of the data are essential, and which are redundant. This study reveals significant redundancies in electronic structure datasets across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and chemically complex alloys -- challenging the notion that extensive datasets are essential for accurate ML-based electronic structure predictions. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy. Furthermore, a state-of-the-art coverage-based pruning strategy that selects data across all learning difficulties, retains chemical accuracy and model generalizability using up to 100-fold less data, while reducing training time by threefold or greater. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods, which eliminate easy-to-learn data, can catastrophically fail at higher pruning factors due to significant reduction in data coverage. This heretofore unexplored high redundancy in electronic structure data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset representative of each material class.

Title: Observation of Integer and Fractional Chern insulators in high Chern number flatbands
Authors: Jingwei Dong, Le Liu, Jundong Zhu, Zitian Pan, Yu Hong, Fankun Wang, Zhiyuan Ren, Zhengnan Jia, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Luojun Du, Dongxia Shi, Wei Yang, Guangyu Zhang
Abstract: Moiré flatbands with high Chern numbers (C>1) offer opportunities to study the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects that go beyond the Landau level paradigm with C=1, which remain unexplored yet. Here, we target the novel topological phases in high Chern number flatbands by designing a new moiré system, i.e., twisted rhombohedral trilayer-bilayer graphene. We observe quantized anomalous Hall effects (QAH) with C = 3 at v = 1 and v = 3, demonstrating the high Chern number nature of the flat band from continuum calculations. By fractionally filling the flat band, we observe QAH with C = 2 at even-denominator fractional filling v = 3/2, as well as QAH with C = 3 continuously from v = 1 to the even-denominator v = 3/2 at zero magnetic fields. Most importantly, we observe, for the first time, evidence of an FCI with C = -6/5 at v = 12/5, corresponding to 2/5 filling of a high Chern number flat band with C = -3, verified by both Streda formula analysis and a fractionally QAH. It is also worth noting that Streda formula analysis reveals a signature of another FCI with C = -3/2 at v = 5/2 under finite magnetic fields. Our results demonstrate the tRTBG, which can be naturally extended to other twisted graphene moiré superlattices based on rhombohedral graphene multilayers, as a novel platform for hosting unconventional high Chern number correlated topology in the ultra-strong correlated regime that is beyond the paradigm of fractional phases with C < 1.

Title: Phonon-Mediated Chirality Transfer from Organic Cation to Inorganic lattice in Hybrid Perovskites
Authors: Sankaran Ramesh, Prasenjit Mandal, Rafael Araujo, Jakob Thyr, Pratik Bhagwat, Yong Li, Tomas Edvinsson, Tönu Pullerits, Dmitry Baranov
Abstract: Two-dimensional hybrid metal halide perovskites combine strong spin-orbit coupling, soft lattice dynamics and molecular tunability, making them promising platforms for chiral optoelectronics and spin dependent phenomena. While chiral organic spacers are known to induce optical activity, the microscopic mechanism by which molecular chirality couples to the inorganic lattice remains unclear. Here, we investigate coherent vibrational dynamics in the chiral perovskite ($R$-MBA)$_2$PbI$_4$ and its racemic analogue using transient absorption spectroscopy, complemented by Raman spectroscopy and ab-initio calculations. We identify a coherent phonon at ~5.7 meV that couples strongly to excitons in the chiral material but is absent in the racemic counterpart. This mode is assigned to lattice vibrations involving coupled motion of the chiral spacer and Pb-I framework, including rotational displacement patterns. These results establish coherent lattice motion as a pathway for mediating chiral responses in hybrid materials.

Title: Beyond-mean-field fluctuations for the solution of constraint satisfaction problems
Authors: Niklas Foos, Bastian Epping, Jannik Grundler, Alexandru Ciobanu, Ajainderpal Singh, Tim Bode, Moritz Helias, David Dahmen
Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) lie at the heart of complexity theory and find application in a plethora of prominent tasks ranging from cryptography to genetics. Classical approaches use Hopfield networks to find approximate solutions while recently, modern machine-learning techniques like graph neural networks have become popular for this task. In this study, we employ the known mapping of MAX-2-SAT, a class of CSPs, to a spin-glass system from statistical physics, and use Glauber dynamics to approximately find its ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution of the underlying problem. We show that Glauber dynamics outperforms the traditional Hopfield-network approach and can compete with state-of-the-art solvers. A systematic theoretical analysis uncovers the role of stochastic fluctuations in finding CSP solutions: even in the absence of thermal fluctuations at $T=0$ a significant portion of spins, which correspond to the CSP variables, attains an effective spin-dependent non-zero temperature. These spins form a subspace in which the stochastic Glauber dynamics continuously performs flips to eventually find better solutions. This is possible since the energy is degenerate, such that spin flips in this free-spin space do not require energy. Our theoretical analysis leads to deterministic solvers that effectively account for such fluctuations, thereby reaching state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Exceptional Andreev spectrum and supercurrent in p-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junctions
Authors: Chang-An Li, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: We investigate the spectrum of Andreev bound states and supercurrent in a $p$-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junction (NHJJ) in one dimension. The studied NHJJ is composed of two topological $p$-wave superconductors connected by a non-Hermitian dissipative junction. Starting from the effective non-Hermitian Bogoliubov-de Gennes bulk Hamiltonian, we find that a pair of exceptional points emerge in the complex spectrum of Andreev quasi-bound states. The two exceptional points with zero energy locate symmetrically with respect to Josephson phase difference $\phi=\pi$, at which a Majorana zero mode persists. Notably, the exceptional points descend from a pair of Majorana zero modes after turning on the non-Hermiticity and are topologically protected. By analyzing the non-Hermitian scattering process at the junction, we explicitly demonstrate the loss of quasiparticles through the decay of scattering amplitude probabilities. Furthermore, we obtain the supercurrent directly by the inelastic Andreev reflection amplitudes, which provides a more intuitive interpretation of transport properties in NHJJs. The supercurrent varies continuously as a function of $\phi$ across the exceptional points. No enhancement of critical current is observed. We also generalize our analysis to a mixed $s$-$p$ wave NHJJ. Our results provide new insights on transport properties of Josephson junctions in presence of Majorana zero modes, exceptional points, and non-Hermiticity.

Title: Path-Integral Formulation of Bosonic Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics with Monte Carlo stochastic trajectories using the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q Functions and Hybrids
Authors: Toma Yoneya, Kazuya Fujimoto, Yuki Kawaguchi
Abstract: The Monte Carlo (MC) trajectory sampling of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) based on the quasiprobabilities, such as the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q functions, enables us to investigate bosonic open quantum many-body dynamics described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. In this method, the MC samplings for the initial distribution and stochastic noises incorporate quantum fluctuations, and thus, we can go beyond the mean-field approximation. However, description using SDEs is possible only when the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation has a positive-semidefinite diffusion matrix. In this work, we analytically derive the SDEs for arbitrary Hamiltonian and jump operators based on the path-integral formula, independently of the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). In the course of the derivation, we formulate the path-integral representation of the GKSL equation by using the $s$-ordered quasiprobability, which systematically describes the aforementioned quasiprobabilities by changing the real parameter $s$. The essential point of this derivation is that we employ the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation in the path integral, and its application is not always feasible. We find that the feasible condition of the HS transformation is identical to the positive-semidefiniteness condition of the diffusion matrix in the FPE. In the benchmark calculations, we confirm that the MC simulations of the obtained SDEs well reproduce the exact dynamics of physical quantities and non-equal time correlation functions of numerically solvable models, including the Bose-Hubbard model. This work clarifies the applicability of the approximation and gives systematic and simplified procedures to obtain the SDEs to be numerically solved.

Title: Metallic Contact Contributions in Thermal Hall Conductivity Measurements
Authors: Hongyu Ma, Xuesong Hu, Junren Shi
Abstract: We investigate the influence of metallic contacts on thermal Hall measurements. By analyzing typical measurement setups, we show that heat currents bypassing through metallic contacts could generate non-negligible thermal Hall signals. We find that contributions from metallic contacts with thicknesses on the order of 10$^{-2}$ of sample widths can approximately replicate experimental observations across different materials in both temperature dependence and magnitude, assuming silver contacts with a conductivity of $10^{8}~\mathrm{S/m}$. Our analysis underscores the need to minimize metallic contact effects in thermal Hall measurements, which can be achieved by optimizing measurement configurations.

Title: Domain Wall-mediated Interfacial Ferroelectric Switching
Authors: Hao-Wen Xu, Wen-Cheng Fan, Jun-Ding Zheng, Cheng-Shi Yao, Ni Zhong, Wen-Yi Tong, Chun-Gang Duan
Abstract: Interfacial ferroelectricity offers a promising platform for ultrafast, low-power memory devices. While previous studies have demonstrated the importance of domain wall in polarization switching, the coexistence of various domain wall types and their impact on polarization stability lacks fundamental understanding. By integrating first-principles calculations, machine learning methods, and experimental validations, we show that domain walls connect opposite polarization states and respond to out-of-plane electric field through polarization vector deviation, leading to inhomogeneous interlayer sliding and domain-wall migration. This mechanism bears clear resemblance to that in traditional ferroelectrics. Notably, different domain wall types result in distinct switching behaviors, which play a crucial role in determining the reversibility of polarization switching. We then propose strategies beyond ideal conditions to achieve non-volatile ferroelectric switching, which are supported by our experimental observations. These insights shed light on the microscopic switching mechanism in hexagonal interfacial ferroelectrics, offering guidance for future nanoelectronics applications.

Title: Controlling Skyrmion Lattice Orientation with Local Magnetic Field Gradients
Authors: Duc Minh Tran, Edoardo Mangini, Elizabeth M. Jefremovas, Fabian Kammerbauer, Dennis Meier, Robert Frömter, Mathias Kläui
Abstract: Precise control over the formation and arrangement of magnetic skyrmion lattices is essential for understanding their emergent behavior and advancing their integration into spintronic and magnonic devices. We report on a simple and minimally invasive technique to nucleate and manipulate skyrmion lattices in soft magnetic CoFeB using single-pass magnetic force microscopy (MFM). By tuning the scan-line spacing to match the intrinsic stripe domain periodicity, the stray field gradient from the MFM tip induces reversible transitions from stripe domains to isolated skyrmions and locally ordered lattices. The resulting skyrmion positions are extracted to compute the local orientational order parameter $\psi_6$, enabling quantitative evaluation of lattice ordering. A systematic improvement in $\langle |\psi_6| \rangle$ is observed with repeated scanning, indicating a transition from a disordered state to ordered hexagonal lattices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the lattice orientation can be deterministically rotated by changing the scanning direction, as confirmed by both real-space analysis and fast Fourier transformations. This method enables the controlled creation, reordering, and deletion of metastable skyrmion textures on demand. Our approach establishes a practical and accessible platform for studying two-dimensional phase behavior in topological spin systems, offering direct and reconfigurable control over lattice symmetry, order, and orientation.

Title: MnBr$_2$ on the graphene on Ir(110) substrate: growth, structure, and super-moirè
Authors: Affan Safeer, Oktay Güleryüz, Nicolae Atodiresei, Wouter Jolie, Thomas Michely, Jeison Fischer
Abstract: Single-layer MnBr$_2$ is grown on graphene (Gr) supported by Ir(110) and investigated using low-energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, and spectroscopy. The structure and epitaxial relationship with the substrate are systematically characterized. The structure and epitaxial relationship with the substrate are systematically characterized. The growth morphology strongly depends on the growth temperature, evolving from fractal to dendritic and eventually to compact dendritic skeletal islands, reflecting changes in the underlying surface diffusion processes. The pronounced variation in the apparent height with tunneling conditions for the magnetic insulator is explained based on the measured electronic density of states. MnBr$_2$ on Gr/Ir(110) constitutes a three-lattice system, giving rise to a super-moiré pattern -- a moiré of moirés. The super-moiré of MnBr$_2$/Gr/Ir(110) is unique, as it involves a virtual moiré of MnBr$_2$ with the Ir(110) surface lattice -- two lattices not in contact with each other. Using a careful Fourier analysis, the known properties of Gr/Ir(110), and the results of ab initio calculations, the origin of the virtual moiré is uncovered and related to the inhomogeneous binding of Gr to Ir(110). Comparative experiments with MnBr$_2$ on Gr/Ir(111) show similar growth and structure, but highlight the unique properties of the MnBr$_2$/Gr/Ir(110) super-moiré.

Title: Emergence of quantum spin liquid and spin-flop phase in Kitaev antiferromagnets in a [111] magnetic field
Authors: Shuai Liu, Hao Wu, Jinbin Li, Xiaoqun Wang, Qiang Luo
Abstract: Kitaev magnets have emerged as pivotal systems for investigating frustrated magnetism, providing a unique platform to explore quantum phases governed by the interplay between bond-dependent anisotropy and external magnetic fields. However, the quantum phase diagrams, particularly near the dominant antiferromagnetic Kitaev regime, remain puzzling despite extensive studies. In this work, we perform unbiased exact diagonalization calculations of the Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model in a [111] magnetic field on a $C_{6}$-symmetric 24-site cluster. By calculating the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux density and the topological entanglement entropy, we reveal multiple phase transitions and identify signatures of both scalar and vector chiral orders in the intermediate-field regime between the Kitaev spin liquid and the polarized phase. As the negative $\Gamma$ interaction increases, we discover a proximate quantum spin liquid featured by a three-peak specific heat and a spin-flop phase at a moderate magnetic field. Our findings provide insight into the field-induced intermediate phases in the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model and pave the way for the hunt for emergent phases in real materials.

Title: The Thermodynamic Limit of Extreme First-Passage Times
Authors: Talia Baravi, Eli Barkai
Abstract: The statistics of the slowest first-passage time among a large population of $N$ searchers is crucial for determining the completion time of many stochastic processes. Classical extreme-value theory predicts that for diffusing particles in a finite domain of size $L$, the slowest first passage time follows a Gumbel distribution, but a Fréchet distribution in an infinite domain. Here, we study the physically relevant thermodynamic limit where both $N$ and $L$ diverge while the density $\rho = N/L$ remains constant. We obtain an explicit solution for the extreme value in the thermodynamic limit, which recovers the Fréchet and Gumbel distributions in the low- and high-density limits, respectively, and reveals new, nontrivial behavior at intermediate densities. We then extend the framework to compact diffusion on fractal domains, showing that the walk dimension $d_w$ and fractal dimension $d_f$ control the extreme-value statistics via geometry-dependent scaling. The theory yields the full set of moments and finite-density corrections, providing a unified description of slowest-arrival times in confined Euclidean and fractal media.

Title: Local Order Average-Atom Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Chloe A. Zeller, Ronald E. Miller, Ellad B. Tadmor
Abstract: This article describes an extension to the effective Average Atom (AA) method for random alloys to account for local ordering (short-range order) effects by utilizing information from partial radial distribution functions. The new Local-Order Average Atom (LOAA) method is rigorously derived based on statistical mechanics arguments and validated for non-stoichiometric binary 2D hexagonal crystals and 3D FeNiCr and NiAl alloys whose ground state is obtained through Monte Carlo sampling. Material properties for these alloys, and phase transformations for the NiAl system, computed from static and dynamic atomistic simulations using standard interatomic potentials (IPs) exhibit a strong dependence on local ordering that is captured by simulations with effective LOAA IPs, but not the original AA method. The advantage of LOAA is that it requires smaller system sizes to achieve statistically converged results and therefore enables the simulation of complex materials, such as high-entropy alloys, at a fraction of the computational cost of standard IPs.

Title: Hybridization Gap and Edge States in Strained-layer InAs/In0.5Ga0.5Sb Quantum Spin Hall Insulator
Authors: Wenfeng Zhang, Peizhe Jia, Wen-kai Lou, Xinghao Wang, Shaokui Su, Kai Chang, Rui-Rui Du
Abstract: The hybridization gap in strained-layer InAs/InxGa1-xSb quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) is significantly enhanced compared to binary InAs/GaSb QSHI structures, where the typical indium composition, x, ranges between 0.2 and 0.4. This enhancement prompts a critical question: to what extent can quantum wells (QWs) be strained while still preserving the fundamental QSHI phase? In this study, we demonstrate the controlled molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of highly strained-layer QWs with an indium composition of x = 0.5. These structures possess a substantial compressive strain within the In0.5Ga0.5Sb QW. Detailed crystal structure analyses confirm the exceptional quality of the resulting epitaxial films, indicating coherent lattice structures and the absence of visible dislocations. Transport measurements further reveal that the QSHI phase in InAs/In0.5Ga0.5Sb QWs is robust and protected by time-reversal symmetry. Notably, the edge states in these systems exhibit giant magnetoresistance when subjected to a modest perpendicular magnetic field. This behavior is in agreement with the Z2 topological property predicted by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model, confirming the preservation of topologically protected edge transport in the presence of enhanced bulk strain.

Title: Nanorod Pair Complexes Manipulated via Magnetic Casimir Forces
Authors: S Pal, L. M. Woods, C. Persson, I. Brevik, U. De Giovannini, M. Boström
Abstract: Controlling nanoscale interactions to suppress aggregation from short-range attractive forces is a key problem in nanoengineering. Here, we demonstrate a route to modulate Casmir-Lifshitz interactions between anisotropic nanoparticles with the magnetic fluids. By semi-classical quantum electrodynamics, we study ground state dispersion forces for cylindrical dielectric nanorods made of polystyrene (PS), and zinc oxide (ZnO) embedded in toluene-based host media with gold-coated magnetite nanoparticles and also predict magnetic contributions to the non-retarded excited state interaction. The variation in magnetic permeability enables tuning between repulsive and attractive interaction and a thermally unstable and measurable magnetic Casimir traps are predicted between a pair of ZnO-PS nanoparticles whose equilibrium position can be modulated over an order of magnitude with a small variation in the size of the magnetite nanoparticle. This provides an alternative magnetic Casimir-effect pathway to reversibly tune quantum electromagnetic forces at the nanoscale for assembly and enhancement of colloidal stability.

Title: Statistical structural properties of many-body chaotic eigenfunctions and applications
Authors: Wen-ge Wang, Qingchen Li, Jiaozi Wang, Xiao Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we employ a semiperturbative theory to study the statistical structural properties of energy eigenfunctions (EFs) in many-body quantum chaotic systems consisting of a central system coupled to an environment. Under certain assumptions, we derive both the average shape and the statistical fluctuations of EFs on the basis formed by the direct product of the energy eigenbases of the system and the environment. Furthermore, we apply our results to two fundamental questions: (i) the properties of the reduced density matrix of the central system in an eigenstate, and (ii) the structure of the off-diagonal smooth function within the framework of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Numerical results are also presented in support of our main findings.

Title: Experimental Evidence of Néel-order-driven Magneto-optical Kerr Effect in an Altermagnetic Insulator
Authors: Haolin Pan, Rui-Chun Xiao, Jiahao Han, Hongxing Zhu, Junxue Li, Qian Niu, Yang Gao, Dazhi Hou
Abstract: The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is investigated in hematite, a collinear antiferromagnetic insulator, across a broad wavelength spectrum. By combining the optical measurements with magnetometry results, we unambiguously demonstrate that the Néel-order contribution dominates the MOKE signal, while contributions from net magnetization and external magnetic fields are negligible. This conclusion is quantitatively supported by first-principles calculations, and qualitatively by a symmetry analysis that the Néel contribution appears at the first order in spin-orbit coupling while the magnetization contribution starts only at the third order. This study clarifies the altermagnetic origin of the pronounced MOKE in hematite, underscoring the potential of altermagnets as a promising new class of magneto-optical materials.

Title: Non-Hermitian off-diagonal disordered optical lattices
Authors: E. T. Kokkinakis, I. Komis, K. G. Makris, E. N. Economou
Abstract: Within the framework of non-Hermitian photonics, we investigate the spectral and dynamical properties of one- and two-dimensional non-Hermitian off-diagonal disordered optical lattices, where randomness is applied to the couplings rather than to the on-site potential terms. We analyze eigenvalue distributions and the localization properties of the eigenmodes, comparing them with those of the corresponding Hermitian lattices. Furthermore, we study their transport behavior under single-channel excitation and identify unconventional phenomena such as jumps between distant lattice regions in systems with a purely real spectrum, as well as complex spectrum-induced Anderson jumps, reported here for the first time in two dimensions. Our results establish a reference framework for non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder and open new directions for future studies of localization phenomena.

Title: Momentum-resolved spectral functions of super-moiré systems using tensor networks
Authors: Anouar Moustaj, Yitao Sun, Tiago V. C. Antão, Jose L. Lado
Abstract: Computing spectral functions in large, non-periodic super-moiré systems remains an open problem due to the exceptionally large system size that must be considered. Here, we establish a tensor network methodology that allows computing momentum-resolved spectral functions of non-interacting and interacting super-moiré systems at an atomistic level. Our methodology relies on encoding an exponentially large tight-binding problem as an auxiliary quantum many-body problem, solved with a many-body kernel polynomial tensor network algorithm combined with a quantum Fourier transform tensor network. We demonstrate the method for one and two-dimensional super-moiré systems, including super-moiré with non-uniform strain, interactions treated at the mean-field level, and quasicrystalline super-moiré patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows us to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions restricted to selected regions of a super-moiré, enabling direct imaging of position-dependent electronic structure and minigaps in super-moiré systems with non-uniform strain. Our results establish a powerful methodology to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions in exceptionally large super-moiré systems, providing a tool to directly model scanning twisting microscope tunneling experiments in twisted van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: Ab initio prediction of strain-tunable spin defects in quasi-1D TiS3 and NbS3 nanowires
Authors: Jordan Chapman, Arindom Nag, Thang Pham, Vsevolod Ivanov
Abstract: Defects in atomically thin van der Waals materials have recently been investigated as sources of spin-photon entanglement with sensitivity to strain tuning. Unlike many two-dimensional materials, quasi-one-dimensional materials such as transition metal trichalcogenides exhibit in-plane anisotropy resulting in axis-dependent responses to compressive and tensile strains. Herein, we characterize the tunable spin and optical properties of intrinsic vacancy defects in titanium trisulfide (TiS3) and niobium trisulfide (NbS3) nanowires. Within our ab initio approach, we show that sulfur vacancies and divacancies (VS and VD , respectively) in TiS3 and NbS3 adopt strain-dependent defect geometries between in-plane strains of -3 % and 3 %. The calculated electronic structures indicate that both VS and VD possess in-gap defect states with optically bright electronic transitions whose position relative to the conduction and valence bands varies with in-plane strain. Further, our calculations predict that VS in TiS3 and VD in NbS3 exhibit transitions in their ground state spins; specifically, a compressive strain of 0.4 % along the direction of nanowire growth causes a shift from a triplet state to a singlet state for the VS defect in TiS3, whereas a tensile strain of 2.9 % along the same direction in NbS3 induces a triplet ground state with a zero-phonon line of 0.83 eV in the VD defect. Our work shows that the anisotropic geometry of TiS3 and NbS3 nanowires offers exceptional tunability of optically active spin defects that can be used in quantum applications.

Title: Utilizing Quantum Processor for the Analysis of Strongly Correlated Materials
Authors: Hengyue Li, Yusheng Yang, Pin Lv, Jinglong Qu, Zhe-Hui Wang, Jian Sun, Shenggang Ying
Abstract: This study introduces a systematic approach for analyzing strongly correlated systems by adapting the conventional quantum cluster method to a quantum circuit model. We have developed a more concise formula for calculating the cluster's Green's function, requiring only real-number computations on the quantum circuit instead of complex ones. This approach is inherently more suited to quantum circuits, which primarily yield statistical probabilities. As an illustrative example, we explored the Hubbard model on a 2D lattice. The ground state is determined utilizing Xiaohong, a superconducting quantum processor equipped with 66 qubits, supplied by QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. Subsequently, we employed the circuit model to compute the real-time retarded Green's function for the cluster, which is then used to determine the lattice Green's function. We conducted an examination of the band structure in the insulator phase of the lattice system. This preliminary investigation lays the groundwork for exploring a wealth of innovative physics within the field of condensed matter physics.

Title: Approach to Hyperuniformity in the One-Dimensional Facilitated Exclusion Process
Authors: S. Goldstein, J. L. Lebowitz, E. R. Speer
Abstract: For the one-dimensional Facilitated Exclusion Process with initial state a product measure of density $\rho=1/2-\delta$, $\delta\ge0$, there exists an infinite-time limiting state $\nu_\rho$ in which all particles are isolated and hence cannot move. We study the variance $V(L)$, under $\nu_\rho$, of the number of particles in an interval of $L$ sites. Under $\nu_{1/2}$ either all odd or all even sites are occupied, so that $V(L)=0$ for $L$ even and $V(L)=1/4$ for $L$ odd: the state is hyperuniform, since $V(L)$ grows more slowly than $L$. We prove that for densities approaching 1/2 from below there exist three regimes in $L$, in which the variance grows at different rates: for $L\gg\delta^{-2}$, $V(L)\simeq\rho(1-\rho)L$, just as in the initial state; for $A(\delta)\ll L\ll\delta^{-2}$, with $A(\delta)=\delta^{-2/3}$ for $L$ odd and $A(\delta)=1$ for $L$ even, $V(L)\simeq CL^{3/2}$ with $C=2\sqrt{2/\pi}/3$; and for $L\ll\delta^{-2/3}$ with $L$ odd, $V(L)\simeq1/4$. The analysis is based on a careful study of a renewal process with a long tail. Our study is motivated by simulation results showing similar behavior in higher dimensions; we discuss this background briefly.

Title: Quantum simulation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model using time-dependent disorder in optical cavities
Authors: Rahel Baumgartner, Pietro Pelliconi, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Francesca Orsi, Nick Sauerwein, Philipp Hauke, Jean-Philippe Brantut, Julian Sonner
Abstract: The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model is a paradigm for extreme quantum chaos, non-Fermi-liquid behavior, and holographic matter. Yet, the dense random all-to-all interactions that characterize it are an extreme challenge for realistic laboratory realizations. Here, we propose a general scheme for densifying the coupling distribution of random disorder Hamiltonians, using a Trotterized cycling through sparse time-dependent disorder realizations. To diagnose the convergence of sparse to dense models, we introduce an information-theory inspired diagnostic. We illustrate how the scheme can come to bear in the realization of the complex SYK$_4$ model in cQED platforms with available experimental resources, using a single cavity mode together with a fast cycling through independent speckle patterns. The simulation scheme applies to the SYK class of models as well as spin glasses, spin liquids, and related disorder models, bringing them into reach of quantum simulation using single-mode cavity-QED setups and other platforms.

Title: Laser Stabilised Ionising Transitions
Authors: Erika Cortese, Simone De Liberato
Abstract: We investigate a ionising electronic transition under resonant pumping. We demonstrate that, above a critical value of the pump intensity, a novel metastable electronic bound state is created, which can decay into the free electron continuum by two-photon ionization. We calculate the system's resonant fluorescence spectrum, finding results qualitatively different from the Mollow triplet expected in a bound-to-bound transition. The fluorescent emission can be used to measure the time-resolved population of the novel metastable state. Contrary to Kramers-Hennenberger atoms, stabilised by non-perturbative, non-resonant laser pulses, the physics we observe is inherently resonant and relies on perturbative level repulsion. In analogy to how the AC-Stark shift is a semiclassical version of the single-photon Rabi splitting observed in photonic cavity, the phenomenon we describe is better understood as a semiclassical version of recently observed excitons bound by a single cavity photon. Our results demonstrate a novel way to stabilise electronic states with intense laser fields, increasing our capability to design and engineer non-classical states of matter.

Title: Implementation and representation of qudit multi-controlled unitaries and hypergraph states by N-body angular momentum couplings
Authors: F. E. S. Steinhoff
Abstract: We construct a representation of qudit multi-controlled unitary operators in terms of N-body angular momentum interactions. The representation is particularly convenient for odd-dimensional systems, with interesting connections to the Pegg-Barnett phase formalism. We illustrate the main points in the special case of qutrits, where simplifications and connections to dipole-quadrupole and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions can be established. We describe the representation of the closely related set of qudit hypergraph states, identifying possible realizations and their main obstacles. Qutrit tripartite controlled unitaries are decomposed in terms of more familiar two-body angular momentum couplings, enabling their implementation in a variety of physical systems. We give then a concrete example of implementation of qutrit unitaries and hypergraph states in optical systems that employs single-photon sources, two-mode cross-Kerr interactions and linear optical operations. Moreover, we define a new set of states, called angular momentum hypergraph states, which are more directly related to the angular momentum representation.

Title: High-fidelity realisation of CNOT gate in Majorana-based optical platform
Authors: Jia-Kun Li, Kai Sun, Ze-Yan Hao, Jia-He Liang, Jiannis K. Pachos, Lucy Byles, Jin-Shi Xu, Yong-Jian Han, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo
Abstract: We present the experimental realisation of a robust CNOT quantum gate using Majorana zero modes simulated on a photonic platform. Three Kitaev chains supporting Majorana zero modes at their endpoints are used to encode two logical qubits, and both intra-chain and inter-chain braiding operations are performed to implement the CNOT gate. While the topological encoding of quantum information in Majorana fermions does not offer full topological protection in our non-interacting photonic setting, it nevertheless exhibits a natural resilience to the dominant noise and decoherence effects present in the experiment. Consequently, the fidelity of the CNOT gate is significantly enhanced, surpassing 0.992 and addressing a key limitation in the path toward scalable quantum computation. These results represent a major advancement in topological quantum computing with Majorana fermions and underscore the potential of photonic platforms for realising high-fidelity quantum gates.

Title: Critical Dynamics of Superfluids
Authors: Aristomenis Donos, Polydoros Kailidis
Abstract: We use standard techniques of hydrodynamics to construct a relativistic effective field theory for the low energy dynamics of nearly critical superfluids. In an appropriate non-relativistic limit, our theory predicts an additional coefficient when compared and contrasted to earlier work of Khalatnikov and Lebedev. In addition, we provide an alternative derivation of the same effective theory, using the Keldysh-Schwinger framework for non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we comment on the comparison with the results of an appropriate holographic computation presented in a companion paper. This provides further evidence in support of the theory we propose and confirms the existence of the extra coefficient we identified.

Title: Generalizing quantum dimensions: Symmetry-based classification of local pseudo-Hermitian systems and the corresponding domain walls
Authors: Yoshiki Fukusumi, Taishi Kawamoto
Abstract: We study conformal field theories (CFTs) and their classifications from a modern perspective based on the abstract algebraic formalism of symmetries or conserved charges, known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). By studying the algebraic structure of the SymTFTs in detail, we found a natural generalization of the quantum dimensions associated with (pseudo-)Hermitian systems and (non)-unitary CFTs. These generalized data of SymTFTs provide classifications of massless and massive renormalization group flows, which will describe the quantum phase transitions of the corresponding pseudo-Hermitian systems. Moreover, our discussions straightforwardly enable one to relate a general class of coset constructions or level-rank dualities to domain wall problems between topological quantum field theories (or a series of corresponding quantum phase transitions related to the Higgs mechanism). Our work provides a systematic reduction and classification of algebraic data, symmetries, for pseudo-Hermitian systems based on ideas from established mathematical fields, linear algebra and ring theory.

Title: Bismuth nanogratings with narrow plasmon resonances for dynamic polarized color generation and colorimetric sensing
Authors: Fernando Chacón-Sánchez, Fátima Cabello, Marina García Pardo, Emmanuel Haro-Poniatowski, Rosalía Serna, Johann Toudert
Abstract: Bismuth nanostructures are appealing for sustainable color generation and sunlight harvesting, thanks to their non-toxicity and their tunable visible-to-near infrared interband plasmon resonances. However, owing to their broad and polarization-insensitive spectral features, the nanostructures reported so far displayed a limited color tunability and were lacking other functionalities such as sensing. Herein, we report bismuth nanogratings with polarization-sensitive and narrow plasmon resonances (Q > 10). They were fabricated on the $cm^2$ scale following a lithography-free approach: conformal pulsed laser deposition of bismuth onto both the reflective and transparent nanostructured layers of DVDs. We characterized their specular reflectance for different orientations of the plane of incidence, angles of incidence, and polarizations of light. When light is polarized in the plane perpendicular to the lines, plasmon resonances occur and shift across the visible-to-near infrared upon changing the angle of incidence. In contrast, no such resonances occur when light is polarized in the plane parallel to the lines. This results in well-contrasted, polarization-sensitive colors, which are iridescent for the former orientation of polarization, and not for the latter. Resonances strongly shift upon changing the refractive index of the surrounding medium (> 500 nm/RIU), resulting in a marked change in the plasmonic color, e.g., from green in air to red in water. This showcases the potential of these nanogratings for dynamic polarized color generation and colorimetric sensing.

Authors: Chi-Hsien Tai, Wen-Yu Wen
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a time-crystalline phase in a single-band holographic superconductor, extending the AdS/CFT framework. By incorporating a nonlinear gauge-scalar coupling and external driving, we derive coupled equations of motion for the plasma and Higgs modes, analogous to those in high-Tc superconductors. Multi-scale analysis reveals a sum resonance with subharmonic growth indicating broken time-translation symmetry. We perform numerical computation of quasinormal mode and demonstrate the transition to the time-crystalline phase. The holographic model may serve as a robust tool for studying strongly coupled time crystals.

Abstract: Linear phase-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques compatible with high-throughput 4D-STEM acquisition are widely used to enhance phase contrast in weakly scattering and beam-sensitive materials. In these modalities, contrast transfer is often suppressed at low spatial frequencies, resulting in a characteristic contrast gap that limits quantitative imaging. Approaches that retain low-frequency phase contrast exist but typically require substantially increased experimental complexity, restricting routine use. Dark-field STEM imaging captures this missing low-frequency information through electrons scattered outside the bright-field disk, but discards a large fraction of the scattered signal and is therefore dose-inefficient. Fused Full-field STEM (FF-STEM) is introduced as a 4D-STEM imaging modality that overcomes this limitation by combining ptychographic phase reconstruction with tilt-corrected dark-field imaging within a single acquisition. Bright-field data are used to estimate probe aberrations and reconstruct a high-resolution phase image, while dark-field data provide complementary low-frequency contrast. The two channels are optimally fused in Fourier space using minimum-variance weighting based on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio, yielding transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity. FF-STEM preserves the upsampling and depth-sectioning capabilities of ptychography, adds robust low-frequency contrast characteristic of dark-field imaging, and enables dose-efficient, near-real-time reconstruction.
