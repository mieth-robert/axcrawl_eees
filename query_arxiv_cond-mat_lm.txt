Title: Etching-free dual-lift-off for direct patterning of epitaxial oxide thin films
Authors: Jiayi Qin, Josephine Si Yu See, Yanran Liu, Xueyan Wang, Wenhai Zhao, Yang He, Jianbo Ding, Yilin Wu, Shanhu Wang, Huiping Han, Afzal Khan, Shuya Liu, Sheng'an Yang, Hui Zhang, Jiangnan Li, Qingming Chen, Jiyang Xie, Ji Ma, Wanbiao Hu, Jianhong Yi, Liang Wu, X. Renshaw Wang
Abstract: Although monocrystalline oxide films offer broad functional capabilities, their practical use is hampered by challenges in patterning. Traditional patterning relies on etching, which can be costly and prone to issues like film or substrate damage, under-etching, over-etching, and lateral etching. In this study, we introduce a dual-lift-off method for direct patterning of oxide films, circumventing the etching process and associated issues. Our method involves an initial lift-off of amorphous Sr$_3$Al$_2$O$_6$ or Sr$_4$Al$_2$O$_7$ ($a$SAO) through stripping the photoresist, followed by a subsequent lift-off of the functional oxide thin films by dissolving the $a$SAO layer. $a$SAO functions as a ``high-temperature photoresist", making it compatible with the high-temperature growth of monocrystalline oxides. Using this method, patterned ferromagnetic La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ and ferroelectric BiFeO$_3$ were fabricated, accurately mirroring the shape of the photoresist. Our study presents a straightforward, flexible, precise, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective method for patterning high-quality oxide thin films.

Title: Quantum anomalous Hall effect with high Chern number in two dimensional ferromagnets Ti2TeSO
Authors: Panjun Feng, Miao Gao, Xun-Wang Yan, Fengjie Ma
Abstract: Two-dimensional Chern insulators have emerged as crucial platforms for the realization of the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and as such have attracted significant interest in spintronics and topological quantum physics due to their unique coexistence of spontaneous magnetization and nontrivial topological characteristics. Nonetheless, substantial challenges persist in such systems, encompassing spin entanglement and the possession of only one edge state (Chern number C=1), which significantly hinder their practical applications. Herein, we propose a novel two-dimensional ferromagnetic half-semi-Weyl-metal, monolayer Ti2TeSO, that exhibits exceptional electronic properties. Its majority spin channel possesses only a pair of symmetry-protected Weyl points at the Fermi level, while the states of minority one locate far away from the Fermi level. When spin-orbit coupling is included, a substantial band gap of ~ 92.8 meV is induced at the Weyl points. Remarkably, the emergence of dual dissipationless chiral edge channels and a quantized Hall conductivity plateau at 2e2/h collectively establish monolayer Ti2TeSO as a high-Chern-number insulator with C=2. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that valley polarization can be achieved and controlled through the application of strain and the manipulation of the direction of magnetization. The first-principles calculations, in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations, yield a Curie temperature of 161 K for monolayer Ti2TeSO, thereby indicating the plausibility of coexistence of valley polarization and topological states at elevated temperatures. These findings could provide a foundation for the development of multi-channels dissipationless transport devices and nonvolatile multistate memory architectures.

Title: Semi-Dirac spin liquids and frustrated quantum magnetism on the trellis lattice
Authors: Sourin Chatterjee, Atanu Maity, Janik Potten, Tobias Müller, Andreas Feuerpfeil, Ronny Thomale, Karlo Penc, Harald O. Jeschke, Rhine Samajdar, Yasir Iqbal
Abstract: Geometrical frustration in quantum magnets provides a fertile setting for unconventional phases of matter, including quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The trellis lattice, with its complex site arrangements and edge-sharing triangular motifs, presents a promising platform for such physics. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive classification of all fully symmetric QSLs on the trellis lattice using the projective symmetry group approach within the Abrikosov fermion representation. We find 7 U(1) and 25 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ short-ranged $\textit{Ansätze}$, uncovering both gapped and Dirac QSLs as well as a novel semi-Dirac spin liquid, in which the spinon dispersion is linear along one momentum direction but quadratic along the orthogonal one. We demonstrate that such dispersions can occur only at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone with $C_{2v}$ little groups and analyze their characteristic correlation signatures. Moreover, by optimizing over all mean-field states, we map out a phase diagram -- featuring six distinct phases -- of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the trellis lattice. Going beyond mean field, we also assess equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors of these phases using density-matrix renormalization group and Keldysh pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations. Finally, we identify four cuprate and vanadate compounds as promising experimental realizations and provide spectroscopic predictions, based on first-principles Hamiltonians, as a guide for future neutron-scattering studies on these materials.

Title: Doping a spin-one Mott insulator: possible application to bilayer nickelate
Authors: Hanbit Oh, Hui Yang, Ya-Hui Zhang
Abstract: In this article, we review some recent theoretical developments on potential high-temperature superconductors and unconventional metallic states that can arise from doping a spin-one Mott insulator in the $d^{8}$ valence. These studies are particularly relevant-though not limited-to the recently discovered bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We focus on a ferromagnetic (FM) Kondo lattice model with mobile electrons in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital coupled to the localized spin moments in $d_{z^2}$ orbital through a large Hund's coupling $J_H$. In the large $J_H$ limit, the model reduces to the type II t-J model with a mixture of spin-half singlon states and spin-one doublon states. We summarize DMRG results on the Luther-Emery liquid in one dimensional chain and two-leg ladder. Then we mainly focus on bilayer square lattice and show that a large inter-layer coupling $J_\perp$ of $d_{z^2}$ orbital can induce strong inter-layer pairing of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. In the strong $J_\perp$ limit, a kinetic-energy driven high $T_c$ superconductivity is demonstrated in an ideal model with only a single hopping term. Furthermore, the model predicts a symmetric pseudogap metal-dubbed `second Fermi liquid"-in the underdoped regime, yielding a phase diagram analogous to that of hole-doped cuprates. The bilayer Kondo model therefore, presents a promising platform for both realizing higher-Tc superconductors and exploring non-Fermi liquid physics. We also comment on the possible limitations of the current models for the bilayer nickelate material and point out some future directions.

Title: Robust superconductivity upon doping chiral spin liquid and Chern insulators in a Hubbard-Hofstadter model
Authors: Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Stefan Divic, Michael P. Zaletel, Tomohiro Soejima, Ashvin Vishwanath
Abstract: Demonstrating superconductivity in purely repulsive Hubbard models is a compelling goal which underscores the counter-intuitive ability of Coulomb interactions to mediate superconductivity. Here, we present numerical evidence for robust superconductivity in a triangular Hubbard-Hofstadter model at $\pi/2$ flux per plaquette. Employing infinite density matrix renormalization group calculations on infinite cylinders of finite circumference, we observe superconducting ground states for a wide range of dopings, whose pair-correlations strengthen as the 2D limit is approached. At a density of one electron per site, Hubbard interactions have been reported to drive the insulating parent state of the superconductor from an integer quantum Hall (IQH) state to a chiral spin liquid (CSL). Our findings give credence to a recent proposal that proximity to the IQH-CSL transition serves to make chiral superconductivity energetically favorable on doping, and also correctly predicts the nature of the edge modes in the superconductor. On the CSL side, this suggests the superconductor can be thought of as arising from Laughlin's `anyon superconductivity' mechanism. Thus the Hubbard-Hofstadter model studied here offers a clean and experimentally accessible setup, potentially realizable in moiré heterostructures, for exploring the properties of anyonic matter at finite density and the interplay of topological order, quantum criticality and superconductivity.

Title: Ultrafast anisotropic exciton transport in phosphorene
Authors: Kai-Wei Chang, Joshua J. P. Thompson, Bartomeu Monserrat
Abstract: Phosphorene is a two-dimensional (2D) material exhibiting strong in-plane structural anisotropy. In this work, we investigate the influence of structural anisotropy on the optics, dynamics, and transport of excitons in phosphorene by combining microscopic many-body theory with first principles calculations. Our framework offers a complete and material specific description of the excitonic properties of phosphorene, including exciton states and exciton-phonon interactions, which allow us to quantitatively evaluate the optical absorption spectra, exciton relaxation, and exciton transport, revealing direction-dependent characteristics. Interestingly, we identify the critical role of long-range exchange interactions, which significantly enhance the anisotropy of exciton diffusion, particularly at low temperatures. Our work provides fundamental insights into exciton dynamics in an intrinsically anisotropic 2D material, offering guiding principles for the design of next-generation optoelectronic devices.

Title: In search of exotic pairing in the Hubbard model: many-body computation and quantum gas microscopy
Authors: Chunhan Feng, Thomas Hartke, Yuan-Yao He, Botond Oreg, Carter Turnbaugh, Ningyuan Jia, Martin Zwierlein, Shiwei Zhang
Abstract: Pair density waves and exotic superconductivity have long been of strong interest, and have attracted much recent attention. We present a joint theoretical and experimental exploration of possible signatures of fermion pairing with finite center-of-mass momentum, or the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) order. Experimentally a doped and spin-imbalanced attractive two-dimensional Hubbard model is realized with a cold atomic gas in an optical lattice, and quantum gas microscopy is used to probe its properties. Computationally we study the same model with state-of-the-art constrained-path (CP) auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). Direct comparisons between experiment and computation on various short-range magnetic and charge correlations show excellent agreement. We then investigate these correlations, as well as pairing correlation functions, systematically to low temperatures with CP-AFQMC, and determine parameter regimes in density and magnetization where signatures of FFLO order may be observed. We show that the temperature at which precursors of such orders appear is already within reach of the current experiment. We discuss routes for direct experimental detection and measurements of such states.

Title: Competing Dirac masses in one dimension: Symmetry-enhanced pseudo-first-order transition and deconfined criticality
Authors: Manuel Weber
Abstract: Emergent symmetries and slow crossover phenomena are central themes in quantum criticality and manifest themselves in the pseudocritical scaling experienced in the context of deconfined criticality. Here we discover its conceptual counterpart, i.e., a symmetry-enhanced pseudo-first-order transition. It emerges from a one-dimensional realization of deconfined criticality between charge- and bond-ordered states driven by competing Holstein and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon couplings, for which quantum fluctuations and thereby the nature of the transition can be tuned systematically via the phonon frequency $\omega_0$. In the classical limit $\omega_0 \to 0$, a low-energy Dirac theory predicts a direct first-order transition with emergent U(1) symmetry. Using exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we provide strong evidence for symmetry enhancement and even finite-size scaling on intermediate length scales but in the thermodynamic limit it turns into a narrow intermediate phase where both order parameters are finite, as chiral U(1) symmetry is weakly broken on the lattice. Including quantum lattice fluctuations diminishes the width of the intermediate phase, gradually restores the U(1) symmetry, and eventually tunes the system to a deconfined quantum critical point.

Title: Generative AI for Crystal Structures: A Review
Authors: Pierre-Paul De Breuck, Hai-Chen Wang, Gian-Marco Rignanese, Silvana Botti, Miguel A. L. Marques
Abstract: As in many other fields, the rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence is reshaping materials discovery by offering new ways to propose crystal structures and, in some cases, even predict desired properties. This review provides a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in generative models specifically for inorganic crystalline materials. We begin by introducing the fundamentals of generative modeling and invertible material descriptors. We then propose a taxonomy based on architecture, representation, conditioning, and materials domain to categorize the diverse range of current generative AI models. We discuss data sources and address challenges related to performance metrics, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarks. Specific examples and applications of novel generated structures are presented. Finally, we examine current limitations and future directions in this rapidly evolving field, highlighting its potential to accelerate the discovery of new inorganic materials.

Title: Topological Chiral Superconductivity in the Triangular-Lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard Model
Authors: Feng Chen, Wen O. Wang, Jia-Xin Zhang, Leon Balents, D. N. Sheng
Abstract: Moiré materials provide exciting platforms for studying the interplay of strong electronic correlation and large magnetic flux effects. We study the lightly doped Hofstadter-Hubbard model on a triangular lattice through large-scale density matrix renormalization group and determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find strong evidence for a robust chiral superconducting (SC) phase with dominant power-law pairing correlations and a quantized spin Chern number. The SC phase emerges at very weak interaction and grows stronger at intermediate interaction strengths (U ) for a wide range of hole doping. We also discuss the possible distinct nature of the normal state in different U regimes. Our work provides theoretical insights into the emergence of topological superconductivity from doping topological Chern bands or magnetic flux induced chiral spin liquid states of Moiré materials.

Title: Quantum Transport in Ultrahigh-Conductivity Carbon Nanotube Fibers
Authors: Shengjie Yu, Natsumi Komatsu, Liyang Chen, Joe F. Khoury, Nicolas Marquez Peraca, Xinwei Li, Oliver S. Dewey, Lauren W. Taylor, Ali Mojibpour, Yingru Song, Geoff Wehmeyer, Matteo Pasquali, Matthew S. Foster, Douglas Natelson, Junichiro Kono
Abstract: We investigate quantum transport in aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers fabricated via solution spinning, focusing on the roles of structural dimensionality and quantum interference effects. The fibers exhibit metallic behavior at high temperatures, with conductivity increasing monotonically as the temperature decreases from room temperature to approximately 36 K. Below this temperature, the conductivity gradually decreases with further cooling, signaling the onset of quantum conductance corrections associated with localization effects. Magnetoconductance measurements in both parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields exhibit pronounced positive corrections at low temperatures, consistent with weak localization (WL). To determine the effective dimensionality of electron transport, we analyzed the data using WL models in 1D, 2D, and 3D geometries. We found that while the 2D model can reproduce the field dependence, it lacks physical meaning in the context of our fiber architecture and requires an unphysical scaling factor to match the experimental magnitude. By contrast, we developed a hybrid 3D+1D WL framework that quantitatively captures both the field and temperature dependences using realistic coherence lengths and a temperature-dependent crossover parameter. Although this combined model also employs a scaling factor for magnitude correction, it yields a satisfactory fit, reflecting the hierarchical structure of CNT fibers in which transport occurs through quasi-1D bundles embedded in a 3D network. Our results establish a physically grounded model of phase-coherent transport in macroscopic CNT assemblies, providing insights into enhancing conductivity for flexible, lightweight power transmission applications.

Title: $P$-type Ru$_2$Ti$_{1-x}$Hf$_x$Si full-Heusler bulk thermoelectrics with $zT = 0.7$
Authors: Fabian Garmroudi, Illia Serhiienko, Michael Parzer, Andrej Pustogow, Raimund Podloucky, Takao Mori, Ernst Bauer
Abstract: Heusler compounds have emerged as important thermoelectric materials due to their combination of promising electronic transport properties, mechanical robustness and chemical stability -- key aspects for practical device integration. While a wide range of XYZ-type half-Heusler compounds have been studied for high-temperature applications, X$_2$YZ-type full-Heuslers, often characterized by narrower band gaps, may offer potential advantages at different temperature regimes but remain less explored. In this work, we report the discovery of $p$-type Ru$_2$Ti$_{1-x}$Hf$_x$Si full-Heusler thermoelectrics, exhibiting a high figure of merit $zT \sim 0.7$ over a broad range of temperatures $700-1000$ K. These results not only represent the largest values known to date among full-Heusler materials but confirm earlier theoretical predictions that $p$-type Ru$_2$TiSi systems would be superior to their $n$-type counterparts. Moreover, using a two-band model, we unveil electronic structure changes induced by the Hf substitution at the Ti site and outline strategies to further improve $zT$ up to $zT > 1$. Our findings highlight the untapped potential of new semiconducting full-Heusler phases and the crucial need for continued exploration of this rich materials class for thermoelectric applications.

Title: Decomposition of low-angle grain boundaries
Authors: Wei Wan, Changxin Tang, Eric R Homer
Abstract: Grain boundaries (GBs) merge and grains disappear during microstructure evolution. However, the Peach-Koehler model predicts that particular stress states may reverse such a process by exerting differential Peach-Koehler forces on different dislocations. This work considers this reversal as GB decomposition and illustrates it in a low-angle asymmetric tilt GB and a low-angle mixed tilt-twist GB via atomistic simulation. In both cases, the dislocations separate into two GBs separated by a new grain. This work describes the requirements for decomposition and the importance of dislocation separability. Additionally, we examine the dislocation behaviors and stress signatures associated with this process, along with the impact of strain rate and temperature on those aspects.

Title: Gravity and Composition Modulated Solidification and Mechanical Properties of Al-Cu Nanostructures
Authors: Apurba Sarker, Sourav Saha
Abstract: The future of space exploration and human settlement beyond Earth hinges on a deeper understanding of in space manufacturing processes. The unique physical conditions and scarcity of experimental data demand robust computational models to investigate the atomic scale physics of solidification. This work presents a molecular dynamics (MD) model to examine the solidification behavior of the Al Cu binary alloy, focusing on the influence of varying compositions and gravity levels (Earth, Lunar, Martian, and microgravity) on atomistic solidification mechanisms and the resulting mechanical properties specifically, hardness of as solidified nanostructures. Hardness is evaluated via nanoindentation simulations. The study confirms that gravitational forces significantly affect the solidification pathways of Al Cu alloys. Notably, by tuning alloy composition, the influence of gravity can be modulated and in some cases, even reversed. Moreover, hardness exhibits a coupled dependence on both composition and gravity, offering a promising avenue for bottom-up design of components tailored for extraterrestrial environments. The article delves into the nanoscale physical mechanisms underlying these phenomena and outlines future directions for extending this modeling framework to broader applications.

Title: Current-induced molecular dissociation: Topological insulators as robust reaction platforms
Authors: Erika L. Mehring, Amparo Figueroa, Matias Berdakin, Hernán L. Calvo
Abstract: The growing interest in topological materials with symmetry-protected surface states as catalytic platforms has sparked the emerging field of \textit{topocatalysis}. As robust transport is one of the key features of topological insulators, here we explore current-induced molecular dissociation in a transport setup. Using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we compare how the occupancies of bonding and antibonding levels, as well as the associated electronic forces in a diatomic molecule, are affected when the molecule is coupled to either a metallic (graphene) or a topological (Kane-Mele) substrate. We find a greater dissociative capability in the topological substrate than in graphene, a difference mainly attributed to the localized nature of the edge states. The inclusion of vacancy disorder within the substrate further enhances this disparity in the dissociative force. Our findings highlight the role of topological protection in molecular dissociation under non-equilibrium conditions, pointing to new opportunities for robust catalysis in topological materials.

Title: NeuroQD: A Learning-Based Simulation Framework For Quantum Dot Devices
Authors: Shize Che, Junyu Zhou, Seong Woo Oh, Jonathan Hess, Noah Johnson, Mridul Pushp, Robert Spivey, Anthony Sigillito, Gushu Li
Abstract: Electron spin qubits in quantum dot devices are promising for scalable quantum computing. However, architectural support is currently hindered by the lack of realistic and performant simulation methods for real devices. Physics-based tools are accurate yet too slow for simulating device behavior in real-time, while qualitative models miss layout and wafer heterostructure. We propose a new simulation approach capable of simulating real devices from the cold-start with real-time performance. Leveraging a key phenomenon observed in physics-based simulation, we train a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer the qubit-layer electrostatic potential from gate voltages. Our GPU-accelerated inference delivers >1000x speedup with >96% agreement to the physics-based simulation. Integrated into the experiment control stack, the simulator returns results with millisecond scale latency, reproduces key tuning features, and yields device behaviors and metrics consistent with measurements on devices operated at 9 mK.

Title: Highly tunable band structure in ferroelectric R-stacked bilayer WSe$_2$
Authors: Zhe Li, Prokhor Thor, George Kourmoulakis, Tatyana V. Ivanova, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Hongyi Yu, Mauro Brotons-Gisbert, Brian D. Gerardot
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers unite two frontiers of quantum materials research: sliding ferroelectricity, arising from rhombohedral (R) stacking, and moiré quantum matter, emerging from small-angle twisting. The spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric R-stacked homobilayers produces a highly tunable band structure, which, together with strain-induced piezoelectricity, governs the topology and correlated electronic phases of twisted bilayers. Here we present a systematic low-temperature optical spectroscopy study of R-stacked bilayer WSe$_2$ to quantitatively establish its fundamental electronic and ferroelectric properties. Exciton and exciton-polaron spectroscopy under doping reveals a pronounced electron-hole asymmetry that confirms type-II band alignment, with the conduction and valence band edges located at the $\Lambda$ and K valleys, respectively. Through distinct excitonic responses and tunable interlayer-intralayer exciton hybridization under displacement fields, we uncover the coexistence of AB and BA ferroelectric domains. Using exciton-polarons as a probe, we directly measure the intrinsic polarization field and extract the interlayer potential. Finally, we demonstrate electric-field-driven symmetric switching of the valence band maximum, attributed to ferroelectric domain switching. These results provide a complete experimental picture of the band alignment, spontaneous polarization field, and domain dynamics of R-stacked WSe$_2$, establishing key parameters to understand twisted bilayers and enabling new ferroelectric and excitonic device opportunities.

Title: Magnetic resonance and microwave resistance modulation in van der Waals colossal-magnetoresistance material
Authors: Miuko Tanaka, Abdul Ahad, Darius-Alexandru Deaconu, Varun Shah, Daisuke Nishio-Hamane, Tomohiro Ishii, Masayuki Hashisaka, Shoya Sakamoto, Shinji Miwa, Mohammad Saeed Bahramy, Toshiya Ideue
Abstract: Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is a fascinating quantum phenomenon that continues to draw significant interest in condensed matter physics. Mn3Si2Te6 has emerged as a prototypical CMR material, notable for its puzzling magnetoresistance behavior and pronounced directional anisotropy. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms driving CMR in Mn3Si2Te6 remain elusive [1-4]. In this work, we explore the magnetic resonance of Mn3Si2Te6 and observe a reduced g-factor for magnetic fields applied along the crystalline c-axis compared to the ab-plane, indicating a substantial orbital magnetization contribution along the c-axis. Furthermore, we detect resistance modulation under resonance conditions, suggesting that CMR in Mn3Si2Te6 is sensitive to the out-of-the plane spin polarization. These findings shed new light on the role of orbital magnetic moment in Mn3Si2Te6, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom of electrons in this system.

Title: $\textit{Ab Initio}$ Theory of Eliminating Surface Oxides of Superconductors with Noble Metal Encapsulation
Authors: Cristóbal Méndez, Nathan Sitaraman, Matthias Liepe, Tomás Arias
Abstract: Nanometer-scale surface chemistry limits the performance of SRF cavities and quantum circuits. We present a first-principles framework coupling DFT of interfacial energetics with strong-coupling Eliashberg theory for Nb and Ta bilayers. The approach identifies Au and Au alloys (AuPd, AuPt) as effective passivation layers. We also we introduce a thin Cu wetting underlayer as a means to minimize cap thickness while preserving superconductivity. These newly proposed design rules explain observed behavior in Nb- and Ta-based qubits and will enable longer coherence times and lower surface resistance.

Title: Tunable Coatings on Various Substrates for Self-Adaptive Energy Harvesting with Daytime Solar Heating and Nighttime Radiative Cooling
Authors: Ken Araki, Vishwa Krishna Rajan, Liping Wang
Abstract: In this work, tunable vanadium dioxide (VO2) metafilms on different substrate materials fabricated via low-oxygen furnace oxidation are demonstrated for self-adaptive daytime solar heating and nighttime radiative cooling. Because of its thermally-driven insulator-to-metal phase transition behavior, the VO2 metafilms work as spectrally-selective solar absorber with a high solar absorptance of 0.86 and a low infrared emissivity of ~0.2 at daytime, while they behave as selective cooler at nighttime to dissipate heat effectively through the atmospheric transparency window with a high emissivity of ~0.76 to cold outer space. From the outdoor vacuum tests, a significant temperature rise up to 169 K upon solar heating and a temperature drop of 17 K at night are experimentally observed from these tunable VO2 metafilms. With the atmosphere temperature fitted in-situ, the accurate heat transfer model shows excellent agreement with the stagnation temperature measurement, and indicates a high heating power of ~400 W/m2 at 80°C sample temperature in the middle of the day, and a cooling power of ~60 W/m2 at 30°C in equilibrium with ambient at night. This work would facilitate the development of self-adaptive coatings with cost-effective and scalable fabrication approaches for all-day energy harvesting.

Title: Efficient determination of eigenenergies and eigenstates of $N$ ($N=3$--$4$) identical 1D bosons and fermions under external harmonic confinement
Authors: J.D. Norris, D. Blume
Abstract: Few-atom systems play an important role in understanding the transition from few- to many-body quantum behaviors. This work introduces a new approach for determining the energy spectra and eigenstates of small harmonically trapped single-component Bose and Fermi gases with additive two-body zero-range interactions in one spatial dimension. The interactions for bosons are the usual $\delta$-function interactions while those for fermions are $\delta$-function interactions that contain derivative operators. Details of the derivation and benchmarks of the numerical scheme are presented. Extensions to other systems are discussed.

Title: Effect of $Γ_7$ and $Γ_8$ Hybridizations on Three-Channel Kondo Phase Emerging from Ho Ions
Authors: Takashi Hotta
Abstract: By employing a numerical renormalization group method, we analyze a seven-orbital impurity Anderson model for Ho$^{3+}$ ion with ten $4f$ electrons. This model includes both $V_7$ and $V_8$, which are hybridizations between localized $4f$- and conduction electrons in $\Gamma_7$ and $\Gamma_8$ orbitals, respectively. For the case of $V_7=V_8$ with the local $\Gamma_5$ triplet ground state, we have reported the discovery of a three-channel Kondo (TCK) phase, characterized by a residual entropy of $\log \phi$ with the golden ratio $\phi=(1+\sqrt{5})/2$. In this research, by depicting the ground-state phase diagram on the $(V_8, V_7)$ plane, we attempt to unveil the effect of $V_7$ and $V_8$ on the emergence of the TCK phase. After performing a lot of numerical calculations, we find that the TCK phase appears in a relatively wide region on the $(V_8, V_7)$ plane. The boundary curves surrounding the TCK phase are determined by the variation of the temperature dependence in entropy and the abrupt change in energy spectra. We consider that most of the phases surrounding the TCK phase are Fermi liquids, but the non-Fermi liquid two-channel Kondo phase is unexpectedly found to exist next to the TCK phase. Finally, we briefly comment on the actual material concerning the detection of the TCK phase.

Title: Size-Dependent Structural Motifs in Ag$_n$Mo (n = 2-13) Clusters: From Planar to Icosahedral Architectures
Authors: Samantha Ortega-Flores, Peter Ludwig Rodríguez-Kessler
Abstract: We present a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study of Mo-doped silver clusters Ag$_n$Mo ($n=1$-14), focusing on their structural, electronic, and bonding properties. Global optimization reveals an evolution from planar and low-symmetry isomers in small clusters to compact three-dimensional geometries with higher symmetry, culminating in a highly stable icosahedral structure at $n=12$. Binding energy and second-order energy difference analyses identify $n=12$ as a "magic number" cluster exhibiting enhanced thermodynamic stability and a pronounced HOMO-LUMO gap, indicative of electronic shell closure. Bond length analysis shows relatively constant Ag-Mo distances alongside a size-dependent increase in Ag-Ag bond lengths, reflecting the growth of metallic bonding networks. Hirshfeld charge analysis reveals significant charge transfer from Ag to Mo in small clusters, which decreases with size as the system transitions toward delocalized metallic bonding. These findings provide detailed insights into the size-dependent interplay of geometry, bonding, and electronic structure in Ag$_n$Mo clusters, with implications for their catalytic and material applications.

Title: High-$Q$ membrane resonators using ultra-high-stress crystalline TiN films
Authors: Yuki Matsuyama, Shotaro Shirai, Ippei Nakamura, Masao Tokunari, Hirotaka Terai, Yuji Hishida, Ryo Sasaki, Yusuke Tominaga, Atsushi Noguchi
Abstract: High-quality-factor ($Q$) mechanical resonators are essential components for precise sensing and control of mechanical motion at a quantum level. While amorphous materials such as SiN have been widely used in high-$Q$ mechanical resonators utilizing stress-induced dissipation dilution, crystalline materials have emerging potential to achieve higher quality factors by combining low intrinsic loss and high tensile stress. In this paper, we demonstrate high-Q membrane resonators using ultra-high-stress crystalline TiN. Our membrane resonator exhibits a tensile stress exceeding 2.3 GPa and a quality factor of $Q = 8.0 \times 10^6$ at 2.2 K. By estimating the dilution factor, we infer that our TiN resonator has a intrinsic quality factor comparable to that of SiN membrane resonators. With its ultra-high stress and crystalline properties, our TiN films can serve as a powerful tool for opto- and electromechanical systems, offering highly dissipation-diluted mechanical resonators.

Title: Anisotropic spin fluctuations in the triangular Kondo lattice compound CePtAl$_4$Ge$_2$ probed by site-selective $^{27}$Al NMR
Authors: H. Sakai, S. Shin, S. Kambe, Y. Tokunaga, H. Harima, E. Pomjakushina, T. Park
Abstract: A site-selective $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study is carried out on the Kondo lattice compound CePtAl$_4$Ge$_2$, which crystallizes in a rhombohedral lattice with quasi-two-dimensional Ce layers forming a triangular lattice network. Two inequivalent Al sites, Al(1) and Al(2), are unambiguously assigned by comparing measured nuclear quadrupole parameters with electric field gradients obtained from electronic structure calculations. Knight shift analysis yields distinct hyperfine coupling constants, revealing that they arise predominantly from RKKY-type transferred hyperfine fields through conduction electrons. Spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal pronounced anisotropic spin fluctuations, and comparison of the relaxation rates between the two Al sites clarifies the momentum-space structure of these fluctuations. At low magnetic fields, $(T_1T)^{-1}$ is strongly enhanced on cooling toward the Néel temperature, indicating the growth of in-plane antiferromagnetic correlations in the paramagnetic state.

Title: Aging of glass-forming materials following a temperature jump
Authors: Ayata Ueno, Tomoko Mizuguchi, Takashi Odagaki
Abstract: Aging in a glass forming model in which both trapping effect and delayed response of the free energy landscape (FEL) exist is studied after the temperature is changed. It is confirmed that the trapping effect gives rise to Type-I aging where the relaxation time increases with waiting time regardless of the direction of temperature change, and that the delayed response of the FEL produces Type-II aging where the waiting-time dependence of the relaxation time depends on the direction of temperature change. When both effects exist and the response time of the FEL is appropriate, these effects can be differentiated in the short-time behavior of the temporal relaxation time. It is argued that the material time or the internal clock and the fictive temperature introduced phenomenologically are understood as the concepts describing the delayed response of the FEL to temperature change.

Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on ferromagnets are canonical devices in spintronics, with wide-ranging applications in data storage, computing, and sensing. They simultaneously exhibit mechanisms for electrical detection of magnetic order through the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, and reciprocally, for controlling magnetic order by electric currents through spin-transfer torque (STT). It was long assumed that neither of these effects could be sizeable in tunnel junctions made from antiferromagnetic materials, since they exhibit no net magnetization. Recently, however, it was shown that all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) based on chiral antiferromagnets do exhibit TMR due to their non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin polarization and cluster magnetic octupole moment, which are manifestations of their spin-split band structure. However, the reciprocal effect, i.e., the antiferromagnetic counterpart of STT driven by currents through the AFMTJ, has been assumed non-existent due to the total electric current being spin-neutral. Here, in contrast to this common expectation, we report nanoscale AFMTJs exhibiting this reciprocal effect, which we term octupole-driven spin-transfer torque (OTT). We demonstrate current-induced OTT switching of PtMn3|MgO|PtMn3 AFMTJs, fabricated on a thermally oxidized silicon substrate, exhibiting a record-high TMR value of 363% at room temperature and switching current densities of the order of 10 MA/cm2. Our theoretical modeling explains the origin of OTT in terms of the imbalance between intra- and inter-sublattice spin currents across the AFMTJ, and equivalently, in terms of the non-zero net cluster octupole polarization of each PtMn3 layer. This work establishes a new materials platform for antiferromagnetic spintronics and provides a pathway towards deeply scaled magnetic memory and room-temperature terahertz technologies.

Title: Observation of surface superconductivity in bulk polycrystalline MoS2 induced by electric double-layer doping
Authors: Yoshihiro Shimazu, Tomonori Miyatake, Kento Ueno, Masatomo Uehara
Abstract: We report the observation of electric-field-induced superconductivity on the surface of bulk polycrystalline MoS2 using electric double-layer doping. A gate voltage applied in an ionic liquid environment systematically increased carrier density, leading to an insulator-to-metal transition and a sharp resistance drop at low temperatures, indicating superconductivity. The onset temperature of superconductivity strongly depended on carrier density inferred from conductance, showing a significant increase and eventual saturation. Unlike prior studies limited to single-crystalline MoS2, our results demonstrate that superconductivity can also be electrostatically induced in polycrystalline systems, broadening the scope for exploring gate-controlled superconductivity in a wider range of materials.

Title: First-Order PT Phase Transition in Non-Hermitian Superconductors
Authors: Xuezhu Liu, Ming Lu, Haiwen Liu, X. C. Xie
Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity and environmental dissipation, effectively captured by non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, is a new frontier for exotic quantum phases. We explore a PT-symmetric non-Hermitian superconductor with balanced gain and loss. To ensure experimental relevance, we develop a right-eigenstate-based non-Hermitian mean-field theory. We uncover a novel first-order phase transition that coincides exactly with the PT symmetry breaking point, driven by the interplay between superconducting pairing interactions and non-Hermitian dissipation. In the PT-symmetric phase, moderate NH dissipation enhances superconductivity, while in the PT-broken phase, intensified dissipation significantly suppresses it. These phenomena, characterized by abrupt jumps in observables, can be probed through localized spectral measurements and macroscopic superfluid density analysis. Additionally, the stability analysis offers robust theoretical insights to support experimental investigations of this unique transition.

Title: Deconfined Quantum Critical Point in Quantum Hall Bilayers
Authors: Guangyu Yu, Tao Xiang, Zheng Zhu
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) represent an unconventional class of quantum criticality beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson-Fisher paradigm. Nevertheless, both their theoretical identification and experimental realization remain challenging. Here we report compelling evidence of a DQCP in quantum Hall bilayers with half-filled $n=2$ Landau levels in each layer, based on large-scale variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) simulations and exact diagonalization (ED). By systematically analyzing the ground-state fidelity, low-lying energy spectra, exciton superfluid and stripe order parameters, and ground-state energy derivatives, we identify a direct and continuous quantum phase transition between two distinct symmetry-breaking phases by tuning the layer separation: an exciton superfluid phase with spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking at small separation, and a unidirectional charge density wave with broken translational symmetry at large separation. Our results highlight quantum Hall bilayers as an ideal platform for realizing and experimentally probing DQCPs under precisely tunable interactions.

Title: Machine learning-accelerated search of superconductors in B-C-N based compounds and R3Ni2O7-type nickelates
Authors: Xiaoying Li, Wenqian Tu, Run Lv, Li'e Liu, Dingfu Shao, Yuping Sun, Wenjian Lu
Abstract: Superconductor research has traditionally depended on experiments and theoretical approaches. However, the rapid advancement of data-driven methods and machine learning (ML) has opened avenues for accelerating superconductor discovery. Here, we integrated ML with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to efficiently screen conventional B-C-N based superconductors and identify potential high-TC candidates among R3Ni2O7-type bilayer nickelates. We identified 12 new binary and ternary B-C-N based superconductors with TC >= 10 K, including 3 with TC >= 25 K, such as two structural forms of B2CN (TC = 44.8 K and 41.5 K) and TiNbN2 (TC = 26.2 K). These materials share a common feature of strong {\sigma}-bonds, which is key to achieving relatively high TC. Moreover, we proposed Tb3Ni2O7 (TC = 61.6 K) and Ac3Ni2O7 (TC = 70.3 K) as potential high-TC nickelate superconductors under high pressure. Their electronic structures closely resemble those of La3Ni2O7, especially in the hole-type band dominated by Ni-3dz2 orbital character. We also analyzed feature importance in the ML results for both conventional and high-TC superconductors. These results advance the search for new superconductors and enhance the fundamental understanding of superconducting mechanisms.

Title: Probing ice-rule-breaking transition in $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ thin film by proximitized transport and magnetic torque
Authors: Chengkun Xing, Han Zhang, Kyle Noordhoek, Guoxin Zheng, Kuan-Wen Chen, Lukas Horák, Yan Xin, Eun Sang Choi, Lu Li, Haidong Zhou, Jian Liu
Abstract: While the spin ice state of bulk pyrochlores such as $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ and $\rm{Ho_2Ti_2O_7}$ has been extensively studied in the last several decades due to its unique degenerate ground state and emergent monopole excitation, whether it survives in the thin-film form remains a mystery. The limited volume of thin-film sample makes it challenging to study the intrinsic magnetic properties. Here, we synthesized 18nm-thick $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ thin film on YSZ substrate and capped it by a thin conductive $\rm{Bi_2Ir_2O_7}$ layer, and performed the proximitized magnetoresistance measurements. Our study found that the ice-rule-breaking phase transition survives but with a modified effective nearest-neighbor interaction and distorted Ising spin axes compared to the bulk crystal. The results are supported by the simultaneously measured capacitive torque magnetometry. Our study demonstrates that proximitized transport is an effective tool for thin films of insulating frustrated magnets.

Title: Silicon-monoxide flames: the nucleation and condensation of silica fume
Authors: Nils Erland L. Haugen, Axel Brandenburg, Bernd Friede, Rolf G. Birkeland
Abstract: Silica fume is a valuable by-product from the silicon and ferrosilicon production. It is therefore important to understand the impact on the silica fume quality when converting the furnace feed from fossil-based to renewable reduction materials. Using self-consistent numerical simulations of the nucleation and condensation process, we present a detailed study of the silica fume formation process. It is found that the most critical physical effect that determines the final particle size distribution is coalescence due to Brownian motion. Furthermore, it is crucial to use appropriate thermophysical parameters in order to reproduce reliable particle size distributions. Contrary to what has been done in previous studies on the same topic, this is now done by using reasonable expressions for surface energy, saturation pressure and the nucleation pre-exponential factor. It is also found that under conditions relevant to furnaces, the liberation of latent heat leads to an explosive chain reaction of particle nucleation and condensation when the first particles nucleate and start growing due to condensation. This process continues until the relative saturation pressure of silicon dioxide is reduced to unity. Finally, it is found that the Lagrangian approach for particle tracking is more flexible and accurate, and also more CPU efficient, than the Eulerian approach.

Title: A New Approach to the Glass Transition of Percolated Polymers from the Perspective of Thermal Volume Expansion
Authors: Jan-Kristian Krüger, Bernd Wetzel, Andreas Klingler
Abstract: In 1995, the Nobel Price winner P.W. Anderson made the following remarkable statement: The deepest and most interesting unsolved problem in solid state theory is probably the theory of the nature of glass and glass transition. Although there have been new theoretical developments in the meantime, in our opinion, this situation has only improved marginally to date. One of the main reasons is the insufficient consideration of experimental boundary conditions. A central experimental problem arises from the fact that the time constants required to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium increase sharply in the vicinity of and above a hypothetical static glass transition. If these equilibrium conditions are violated, additional internal thermodynamic variables come into play that normally alter the static and dynamic susceptibilities significantly and thus lead to misinterpretations of the experimental data. This raises, for example, the question of whether there are static property changes during the canonical glass transition and how these correlate with dynamic precursors. In this article, we attempt to find answers to these questions using a new experimental method called temperature-modulated optical refractometry in combination with the temperature-jump technique. The total time required to investigate the glass transition behaviour of our model epoxy was approximately two years.

Title: Ab initio spin Hamiltonians and magnetism of Ce and Yb triangular-lattice compounds
Authors: Leonid V. Pourovskii, Rafael D. Soares, Alexander Wietek
Abstract: We calculate the crystal-field splitting, ground-state Kramers doublet and intersite exchange interactions within the ground-state doublet manifold using an ab initio Hubbard-I based approach for a representative set of Ce and Yb triangular-lattice compounds. These include the putative quantum spin liquids (QSL) RbCeO$_2$ and YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ and the antiferromagnets KCeO$_2$ and KCeS$_2$. The calculated nearest-neighbor (NN) couplings are antiferromagnetic and exhibit noticeable anisotropy. The next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings are ferromagnetic in the Ce systems and dominated by classical dipole-dipole interactions in the Yb case. Solving the resulting effective spin-1/2 models by exact diagonalization up to $N=36$ sites, we predict ordered magnetic ground states for all systems, including the two QSL candidates. We explore the phase space of an anisotropic NN + isotropic NNN triangular-lattice model finding that a significant antiferromagnetic NNN coupling is required to stabilize QSL phases, while the NN exchange anisotropy is detrimental to them. Our findings highlight a possibly important role of deviations from the perfect triangular model - like atomic disorder - in real triangular-lattice materials.

Title: Reciprocity of Magnetism and Nanostructure Growth
Authors: Felix Zahner, Kirsten von Bergmann, Roland Wiesendanger, André Kubetzka
Abstract: The growth of thin films and nanostructures is a fundamental process for constructing both model-type systems and nanoscale devices, where performance and functionalities can be controlled by the choice of parameters. For magnetic systems the crystal structure, material composition, size, and shape determine already most of the magnetism-related properties. Here, we investigate the reciprocal route, which is controlling nanostructure growth via magnetism. To this end we deposit Co on a uniaxial antiferromagnetic surface above and below its Néel temperature. Growth above the Néel temperature results in the formation of roughly hexagonal islands, reflecting the surface symmetry. For growth below the Néel temperature we find quasi-one-dimensional Co nanostructures along distinct crystallographic directions, which signal the local antiferromagnetic domain orientation. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of controlling growth via magnetism and the necessity to take magnetism-related effects into account for growth on magnetic surfaces.

Title: Shift Current Anomalous Photovoltaics in a Double Perovskite Ferroelectric
Authors: Linjie Wei, Fu Li, Yi Liu, Hongbin Zhang, Junhua Luo, Zhihua Sun
Abstract: Ferroelectric anomalous photovoltaic (APV) effect, as a fascinating physical conceptual phenomenon, holds significant potentials for new optoelectronic device applications. However, due to the knowledge lacking on the origin and underlying mechanism of ferroelectric APV effect, substantial challenges still remain in exploring new APV-active candidate materials. The emerging shift current model, involving the transfer of photogenerated charges through the displacement of wave functions, has attracted considerable attention for its unique insights into the bulk photovoltaic effect. Here, we present strong APV properties in a high-temperature double perovskite ferroelectric (cyclohexylmethylammonium)$_2$CsAgBiBr$_7$, showing an extremely large above-bandgap photovoltage up to about 40 V. This figure-of-merit is far beyond its bandgap of about 2.3 eV and comparable to the state-of-art molecular ferroelectrics. Strikingly, the shift current model reveals an intrinsic correlation with Cs$^{+}$ cation displacement and provides, for the first time, an explicit explanation for the structural origin of ferroelectric APV activities. Besides, its steady-state APV photocurrent exhibits the unique light-polarization dependence, which endows remarkable polarization-sensitivity with the highest polarization ratios of about 41 among the known 2D single-phase materials. As the unprecedented exploration of ferroelectric APV characteristics illuminated by the shift current mechanism, this finding paves a pathway to assemble new optoelectronic smart devices.

Abstract: A reliable route to the deterministic fabrication of impurity ion donors in silicon is required to advance quantum computing architectures based upon such systems. This paper reports the ability to dope isotopically-defined unique (${}^{121}\mathrm{Sb}{}^{123}\mathrm{Sb}$) clusters into silicon with measured detection efficiencies of 94% being obtained. Atomically resolved imaging of the doped clusters reveals a Sb-to-Sb separation of ~2 nm post-implantation, thus indicating suitability to form coupled qudit systems. The method used is fully compatible with integration into processing that includes pre-enrichment of the silicon host to < 3ppm ${}^{29}\mathrm{Si}$ levels. As such, we present a potential pathway to the creation of scaled qudit arrays within silicon platforms for quantum computing.

Title: Inherent momentum-dependent gap structure of altermagnetic superconductors
Authors: Christian L. H. Rasmussen, Jannik Gondolf, Mats Barkman, Mercè Roig, Daniel F. Agterberg, Andreas Kreisel, Brian M. Andersen
Abstract: Altermagnetic metals break time-reversal symmetry and feature spin-split Fermi surfaces generated by compensated Néel-ordered collinear magnetic moments. Being metallic, such altermagnets may undergo a further instability at low temperatures to a superconducting state, and it is an interesting open question what are the salient features of such altermagnetic superconductors? We address this question on the basis of realistic microscopic models that capture the altermagnetic sublattice degrees of freedom. We find that the sublattice structure can strongly affect the superconducting gap structure in altermagnetic superconductors. In particular, it imposes nodes in the gap on the Brillouin zone edges for superconductors stabilized by momentum-independent bare attraction channels. We contrast this to the case of nearest-neighbor pairing where pairing is allowed on the Brillouin zone edges and $d$-wave gap structures can be favored.

Title: Effect of Magnetic Anisotropy on Magnetoelastic Waves in Ni/LiNbO3 Hybrid Device
Authors: Minwoo Yu, Moojune Song, Minseok Kang, Mujin You, Yunyoung Hwang, Albert Min Gyu Park, Byong-Guk Park, Kab-Jin Kim, Junho Suh
Abstract: We study the effects of magnetic anisotropy and crystalline axes in surface acoustic waves (SAWs) driven magnetic resonances of Ni/LiNbO3 hybrid devices. SAW absorption from the interaction with magnons in Ni displays a strong anisotropic dependence on the direction of the applied in-plane magnetic field. Magnetic anisotropy is further investigated by magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements to show both uniaxial and biaxial anisotropy components in Ni films on LiNbO3. By introducing a dipolar interaction term in addition to the anisotropies, we successfully explain the anisotropic SAW absorption in our devices. These findings show the importance of substrate-induced anisotropy and long-range dipolar effects in SAW-magnons hybrid devices and indicate future directions for optimizing these spin-acoustic devices through comprehensive anisotropy engineering.

Title: A Review on Phenomenological Models for Chromonic Liquid Crystals
Authors: Silvia Paparini
Abstract: Chromonic liquid crystals (CLCs) are lyotropic materials which are attracting growing interest for their adaptability to living systems. A considerable body of works has been devoted to exploring their properties and applications. In this paper, I endeavour to review some of the contributions concerning their theoretical modelling, aimed at rationalizing experimental observations. The elastic theory of CLCs is not completely established. Their ground state in the 3D space, as revealed by a number of recent experiments, is quite different from that of ordinary nematic liquid crystals: it is twisted instead of uniform. The common explanation provided for this state within the classical Oseen-Frank elastic theory demands that one Ericksen's inequality is violated. Since such a violation would make the Oseen-Frank stored energy density unbounded below, the legitimacy of these theoretical treatments is threatened by a number of mathematical issues. To overcome these difficulties, a novel elastic theory has been proposed and tested for CLCs; it extends the classical Oseen-Frank energy by incorporating a quartic twist term. Another key characteristic of CLCs is that they exhibit broad biphasic regions, in which the nematic and isotropic phases coexist. Mathematical models inspired by experimental settings have been developed for CLC droplets in 2D. The contributions reviewed here address the morphogenesis of nuclei and topological defects during phase transitions, the topological shape transformations arising from the interplay of nematic elastic constants, and the prediction of shape bistability (yet to be observed) where tactoids and smooth-edged discoids can coexist in equilibrium. General methods have also been applied to experimental data to extract estimates of the isotropic surface tension at the nematic isotropic interface and the chromonics' planar anchoring strength.

Title: Material parameter influence on the expression of Solitary-Wave-Induced Surface Dilation
Authors: Eric Frizzell, Christine Hartzell
Abstract: We formulate a method for predicting peak particle forces in a Solitary Wave (SW) wavefront within a randomly filled 3D granular channel. The SW in our simulation are driven by a sustained impact originating in the bumpy floor of the channel. We show that, when generated in this manner, forces in the driven SW wavefront within the 3D assembly follow the same power law scaling on material properties and impact velocity as in a 1D chain. A simple scaling of the 1D forces matches results from simulated impact tests we conduct using Soft Sphere Discrete Element method simulations. We then quantify the magnitude of Solitary Wave Induced Surface Dilation (SID) that occurs as a result of varied material properties and gravitational environments, giving an equation that can be used to predict the lofting depth (depth to which particles experience bulk density changes as a result of a laterally propagating SW wavefront). As predicted by our equation and confirmed with simulated results, SID is amplified as particle material properties become closer to lunar regolith grains, supporting the hypothesis that SID is the Lunar Cold Spot formation mechanism.

Title: Theory of single molecule NMR detection
Authors: Baruch Horovitz, Alexander Shnirman
Abstract: In relation to recent experimental data [1], we develop a theory framework for demonstrating the feasibility of detecting sharp Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) oscillations in a real time ESR data. The procedure is to follow real time oscillations of the ESR signal measured at a selected frequency of a hyperfine transition. We study a variety of systems such as a single radical molecule with one or two hyperfine coupled nuclei or two molecules that coexist as either radicals or non-radicals, facilitated by charge transfer. We develop a master equation for describing these scenarios and find parameters for which a sharp NMR line can be observed. We show that in all cases an off-diagonal term in the hyperfine tensor is essential for the observation.

Title: Family of Unconventional Superconductivities in Crystalline Graphene

Liong, Zach Hadjri, Rasul Gazizulin, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Mingda Li, Dominik M. Zumbühl, Long Ju
Abstract: Unconventional superconductors exhibit multiple broken symmetries and exceed the range of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. For instance, time-reversal symmetry can be broken in addition to the gauge symmetry, resulting in superconductors that can be enhanced or induced by a magnetic field. However, such unconventional superconductivities are more vulnerable to impurities than their BCS counterparts, requiring highly ordered and clean material systems to observe them. Crystalline rhombohedral multilayer graphene is a promising platform to explore unconventional superconductivity due to its superior material quality and gate-tunable strong correlation effects. Here we report transport measurements of rhombohedral tetralayer and pentalayer graphene, where a spectrum of superconductivities in a clean limit are observed. Three of them (SC2-4) show highly unusual enhancements by magnetic fields: 1. SC2 is strengthened by an in-plane field; 2. SC3 is boosted by a small out-of-plane field; 3. SC4 is induced by an in-plane field. All these superconductors are robust against an in-plane field up to 8.5 Tesla, exceeding the Pauli limit of conventional superconductors by tens of times and suggesting their unconventional nature. Moreover, we observed that proximitized spin-orbit coupling generates a plethora of new superconductors in the phase diagram, while maintaining the high quality of bare rhombohedral graphene. Our work establishes a family of new superconductors in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, which also provides an ideal platform to engineer non-Abelian quasiparticles by proximitizing with quantum anomalous Hall states existing in the same material system.

Title: Noise resilience of two-dimensional Floquet topological phases
Authors: Balaganchi A. Bhargava, Sanjib Kumar Das, Lukas M. Sieberer, Ion Cosma Fulga
Abstract: We study the effect of noise on two-dimensional periodically driven topological phases, focusing on two examples: the anomalous Floquet-Anderson phase and the disordered Floquet-Chern phase. Both phases show an unexpected robustness against timing noise. The noise-induced decay of initially populated topological edge modes occurs in two stages: At short times, thermalization among edge modes leads to exponential decay. This is followed by slow algebraic decay $\sim n^{-1/2}$ with the number of Floquet cycles $n$. The exponent of $1/2$ is characteristic for one-dimensional diffusion, here occurring along the direction perpendicular to the edge. In contrast, localized modes in the bulk exhibit faster decay, $\sim n^{-1}$, corresponding to two-dimensional diffusion. We demonstrate these behaviors through full-scale numerical simulations and support our conclusions using analytical results based upon a phenomenological model. Our findings indicate that two-dimensional Floquet topological phases are ideal candidates for potential applications of Floquet topology, given the unavoidable presence of both quenched disorder and decoherence in experiments.

Title: Investigation of non-Hermitian and Hermitian models of Altermagnets
Authors: Partha Goswami
Abstract: Insulating altermagnets like MnTe exhibit spin configurations where opposing spins are not only aligned antiparallel but also rotated relative to each other. This is an arrangement reminiscent of antiferromagnetism with a twist of spin canting. This study investigates a model Hamiltonian that captures the essential physics of such systems, incorporating key interactions including Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and conventional exchange terms, relativistic spin-orbit coupling, and d-wave and g-wave orderings. Non-Hermitian dynamics are introduced through complex potentials that simulate energy dissipation and amplification. The paper delves into the behavior of the quantum geometric tensor and the emergence of the quantum anomalous Hall effect within the topologically insulating regime. It also broadens the scope to encompass non-Hermitian metallic altermagnets, focusing on phases characterized by symmetry-breaking d-wave and g-wave order parameters.

Title: Fabrication and Characterization of the Moiré surface state on a topological insulator

Abstract: A Moire superlattice on the topological insulator surface is predicted to exhibit many novel properties but has not been experimentally realized. Here, we developed a two-step growth method to successfully fabricate a topological insulator Sb2Te3 thin film with a Moire superlattice, which is generated by a twist of the topmost layer via molecular beam epitaxy. The established Moire topological surface state is characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. By application of a magnetic field, new features in Landau levels arise on the Moire region compared to the pristine surface of Sb2Te3, which makes the system a promising platform for pursuing next-generation electronics. Notably, the growth method, which circumvents contamination and the induced interface defects in the manual fabrication method, can be widely applied to other van der Waals materials for fabricating Moire superlattices.

Title: Role of Fe intercalation on the electronic correlation in resistively switchable antiferromagnet Fe$_{x}$NbS$_2$
Authors: Wenxin Li, Jonathan T. Reichanadter, Shan Wu, Ji Seop Oh, Rourav Basak, Shannon C. Haley, Elio Vescovo, Donghui Lu, Makoto Hashimoto, Christoph Klewe, Suchismita Sarker, James G. Analytis, Robert J. Birgeneau, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Yu He
Abstract: Among the family of intercalated transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), Fe$_{x}$NbS$_2$ is found to possess unique current-induced resistive switching behaviors, tunable antiferromagnetic states, and a commensurate charge order, all of which are tied to a critical Fe doping of $x_c$ = 1/3. However, the electronic origin of such extreme stoichiometry sensitivities remains unclear. Combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify and characterize a dramatic eV-scale electronic restructuring that occurs across the $x_c$. Moment-carrying Fe 3$d_{z^2}$ electrons manifest as narrow bands within 200 meV to the Fermi level, distinct from other transition metal intercalated TMD magnets. This state strongly interacts with the itinerant electron in TMD layer, and rapidly loses coherence above $x_c$. These observations resemble the exceptional electronic and magnetic sensitivity of strongly correlated systems upon charge doping, shedding light on the important role of electronic correlation in magnetic TMDs.

Title: Quantifying many-body contributions to depletion forces
Authors: Gabriel Pérez-Angel, Marco A. Ramírez-Guízar, Néstor M. De Los Santos-López, José M. Méndez-Alcaraz, Ramón Castañeda-Priego
Abstract: Effective interactions inherently encompass many-body effects that appear unified. Analyzing these in reverse, that is, separating them into contributions from pairs, triples, or larger groups, is typically intricate and seldom pursued. However, this could offer essential insights into the structural architecture of complex systems, such as soft materials. This contribution tackles this issue employing a new simulation-based approach to accurately determine effective interactions. The approach is sufficiently sensitive to assess the effects of higher-order terms in the depletion potentials between large particles. Previous research has primarily focused on the role of small particles, and this work expands on these findings. However, understanding the contributions of large particles on the effective forces, particularly beyond the dilute limit, remains challenging and is not yet fully grasped, leading us to primarily focus on exploring this topic. Within the range of particle concentrations examined here, while maintaining a constant chemical potential for smaller particles, we have observed that the concentration of larger particles has no impact on the entropic potential between large colloids, as long as the size ratio remains below $q=0.15$. This confirms a long-established prediction founded on purely geometric considerations, which we have confirmed by means of direct observation. In contrast, for mixtures with less size asymmetry, such effects become considerably influential. Specifically, we have conducted an in-depth examination of scenarios with size asymmetries of $q=0.45$ and $0.60$. Our results for the depletion forces were directly compared with those obtained from the integral equation theory, which has also enabled us to improve and refine the approaches involved.

Title: Emergence of spin-mixed superstripe phases in spin-orbit coupled spin-1 condensate
Authors: Sanu Kumar Gangwar, Rajamanickam Ravisankar, Paulsamy Muruganandam, Pankaj Kumar Mishra
Abstract: We numerically investigate the ground state phases and quench dynamics of spin-orbit coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. For finite Rabi coupling, the system exhibits zero-momentum, elongated zero-momentum, and stripe phases, while in the limit $\Omega\rightarrow 0$, the superstripe wave phases emerge. Varying the attractive density-density ($c_0$) and spin-exchange ($c_2$) interactions induces the transition from stripe and superstripe phases to the elongated zero-momentum phase, characterized by miscibility and polarization. The condensate remains miscible in the zero-momentum phase and partially miscible for the elongated, stripe, and superstripe phases. Quenching in Rabi coupling stabilizes the condensate, while spin-orbit coupling quenching leads to fluctuations or the formation of complex patterns, with the stripe phase exhibiting the vanishing of the zeroth spin component over time. Our results may offer valuable insights into engineering exotic quantum phases in ultracold atomic gases.

Title: Controlled Buildup of Half-Quantized Thermal Conductance in an Engineered Chiral Spin Liquid Platform
Authors: Bo-Ye Sun, Baptiste Bermond, Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Marin Bukov, Zheng-Wei Zhou, Nathan Goldman
Abstract: We study thermal transport along the edge of a small chiral-spin-liquid device coupled to two Ising-chain reservoirs, a platform suitable for quantum-engineered systems. Adiabatically switching on the tunnel couplings to the reservoirs generates a thermal current that dynamically builds up and reaches a quasi-steady-state regime. In this time window, the two-terminal thermal conductance can approach half-quantized values -- a hallmark of Majorana-mediated transport -- under finely tuned conditions. The results agree with a steady-state Landauer-Büttiker description for sufficiently large reservoirs, where energy-resolved transmission rates help identify the optimal parameters to achieve the half-quantized conductance. This work provides a controllable platform to investigate topological thermal transport in engineered spin systems, such as realized in cold-atom and Rydberg-atom settings.

Title: Tailored Thermal Transport in Phase Change Materials-Based Nanocomposites through Interfacial Structuring
Authors: Viktor Mandrolko, Mykola Isaiev
Abstract: Interfacial thermal transport is a critical bottleneck in nanoscale systems, where heat dissipation and energy efficiency are strongly modulated by molecular ordering at solid-liquid boundaries. Here, using atomistic simulations of hexadecane confined by structured silica substrates, we reveal how interfacial geometry, specifically curvature, governs the density distribution and thermal transport across the interface. At flat and mildly curved surfaces, the liquid exhibits surface-templated layering, promoting efficient heat transfer, which is enhanced with increasing contact surface area. As curvature increases, this ordering breaks down, giving rise to interference-like density patterns, reduced molecular packing, and localized depletion zones. This structural reorganization leads to a systematic increase in interfacial thermal resistance (ITR), even when the contact area is kept constant. By decomposing the interface into convex ("hill" of solid) and concave ("valley" of solid) regions, we find that valleys consistently offer lower thermal resistance. In contrast, hills act as bottlenecks to heat flow. Remarkably, we show that the work of adhesion and entropy-related energy losses scale non-trivially with curvature: while adhesion increases with contact area, the entropic penalty dominates the total energy change, reflecting curvature-induced frustration of molecular alignment. These findings unveil a direct link between surface geometry, thermodynamic dissipation, and heat transport, offering new design principles for thermally tunable nanostructured materials, thermal interface coatings, and phase-change systems.

Title: Magnetic Bloch bands and Weiss oscillations in Dirac mass superlattices
Authors: A. Anand, R. Egger, A. De Martino
Abstract: We study two-dimensional Dirac fermions in a one-dimensional mass superlattice under a perpendicular magnetic field. Using exact solutions for isolated and finite arrays of domain walls, we demonstrate the persistence of Jackiw-Rebbi modes with a field-dependent renormalized velocity. For the periodic case, we adopt a gauge-invariant projection method onto magnetic Bloch states, valid for arbitrary fields and mass profiles, which yields dispersive Landau levels, and confirm its accuracy by comparison with finite arrays spectra. From the miniband spectra we predict modified quantum Hall plateaus and Weiss-like magnetoconductivity oscillations, characterized by a strongly reduced amplitude and a $\pi/2$ phase shift compared to electrostatic superlattices.

Title: Variation-matching sensitivity-based virtual fields for hyperelastic material model calibration
Authors: Denislav P. Nikolov, Zhiren Zhu, Jonathan B. Estrada
Abstract: Accurate identification of nonlinear material parameters from three-dimensional full-field deformation data remains a challenge in experimental mechanics. The virtual fields method (VFM) provides a powerful, computationally efficient approach for material model calibration, however, its success depends critically on the choice of virtual fields and the informativeness of available kinematic data. In this work, we advance the state-of-the-art discrete formulation of the sensitivity-based virtual fields (SBVF) method by systematically developing and comparing alternative variational and analytical SBVFs within a strain-invariant-based modeling framework. A central contribution of this work is the implementation and assessment of variation-based SBVFs (vSBVFs), formulated using directional Gâteaux derivatives, as well as virtual fields derived from analytical differentiation (aSBVFs) which provide explicit, model-tailored virtual displacement fields for parameter identification. Using simulated noisy volumetric datasets, we demonstrate that vSBVFs and aSBVFs enable procedural, automated construction of optimal virtual fields for each material parameter, substantially enhancing the robustness and efficiency of calibration without the need for manual field selection or high temporal resolution in the data acquisition. We quantify data richness -- the effective diversity of sampled kinematic states -- showing that increased data richness via sample geometry and loading protocols leads to improved parameter identifiability. These findings establish a pathway for automated, noise-robust material model calibration suitable for future deployment with experimental full-field imaging of soft, complex materials, and provide a foundation for optimizing shape topology and extending to viscoelastic and anisotropic behaviors.

Title: Topology meets superconductivity in a one-dimensional $t-J$ model of magnetic atoms
Authors: Leonardo Bellinato Giacomelli, Thomas Bland, Louis Lafforgue, Francesca Ferlaino, Manfred J. Mark, Luca Barbiero
Abstract: Strongly interacting fermions represent the key constituent of several intriguing phases of matter. However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter.

Title: A Comprehensive Assessment and Benchmark Study of Large Atomistic Foundation Models for Phonons
Authors: Md Zaibul Anam, Ogheneyoma Aghoghovbia, Mohammed Al-Fahdi, Lingyu Kong, Victor Fung, Ming Hu
Abstract: The rapid development of universal machine learning potentials (uMLPs) has enabled efficient, accurate predictions of diverse material properties across broad chemical spaces. While their capability for modeling phonon properties is emerging, systematic benchmarking across chemically diverse systems remains limited. We evaluate six recent uMLPs (EquiformerV2, MatterSim, MACE, and CHGNet) on 2,429 crystalline materials from the Open Quantum Materials Database. Models were used to compute atomic forces in displaced supercells, derive interatomic force constants (IFCs), and predict phonon properties including lattice thermal conductivity (LTC), compared with density functional theory (DFT) and experimental data. The EquiformerV2 pretrained model trained on the OMat24 dataset exhibits strong performance in predicting atomic forces and third-order IFC, while its fine-tuned counterpart consistently outperforms other models in predicting second-order IFC, LTC, and other phonon properties. Although MACE and CHGNet demonstrated comparable force prediction accuracy to EquiformerV2, notable discrepancies in IFC fitting led to poor LTC predictions. Conversely, MatterSim, despite lower force accuracy, achieved intermediate IFC predictions, suggesting error cancellation and complex relationships between force accuracy and phonon predictions. This benchmark guides the evaluation and selection of uMLPs for high-throughput screening of materials with targeted thermal transport properties.

Title: The frustrated Ising model on the honeycomb lattice: Metastability and universality
Authors: Denis Gessert, Martin Weigel, Wolfhard Janke
Abstract: We study the Ising model with competing ferromagnetic nearest- and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interactions of strengths $J_1 > 0$ and $J_2 < 0$, respectively, on the honeycomb lattice. For $J_2 > - J_1 / 4$ it has a ferromagnetic ground state, and previous work has shown that at least for $J_2 \gtrsim -0.2 J_1$ the transition is in the Ising universality class. For even lower $J_2$ some indicators pointing towards a first-order transition were reported. By utilizing population annealing Monte Carlo simulations together with a rejection-free and adaptive update, we can equilibrate systems with $J_2$ as low as $-0.23 J_1$. By means of a finite-size scaling analysis we show that the system undergoes a second-order phase transition within the Ising universality class at least down to $J_2 =-0.23 J_1$ and, most likely, for all $J_2 > - J_1 / 4$. As we show here, there exist very long-lived metastable states in this system explaining the first-order like behavior seen in only partially equilibrated systems.

Title: Control across scales: signals, information, and adaptive biological mechanical function
Authors: James Clarke, Jake McGrath, Colin Johnson, José Alvarado
Abstract: Biological systems perform an astonishing array of dynamical processes -- including development and repair, regulation, behavior and motor control, sensing and signaling, and adaptation, among others. Powered by the transduction of stored energy resources, these behaviors enable biological systems to regulate functions, achieve specific outcomes, and maintain stability far from thermodynamic equilibrium. These behaviors span orders of magnitude in length and time: from nanometer-scale molecular motors driving morphogenesis to kilometer-scale seasonal migrations, and from millisecond reflexes to millennia of evolutionary adaptations. While physical laws govern the dynamics of biological systems, they alone are insufficient to fully explain how living systems sense, decide, adapt, and, ultimately, control their dynamics. In this article, we argue that control theory provides a powerful, unifying framework for understanding how biological systems regulate dynamics to maintain stability across length and time scales far from equilibrium.

Title: Phase Diagram and dynamical phases of self organization of a Bose--Einstein condensate in a transversely pumped red-detuned cavity
Authors: Julian Mayr, Maria Laura Staffini, Simon B. Jäger, Corinna Kollath, Jonathan Keeling
Abstract: We study a transversely pumped atomic Bose--Einstein Condensate coupled to a single-mode optical cavity, where effective atom--atom interactions are mediated by pump and cavity photons. A number of experiments and theoretical works have shown the formation of a superradiant state in this setup, where interference of pump and cavity light leads to an optical lattice in which atoms self-consistently organize. This self-organization has been extensively studied using the approximate Dicke model (truncating to two momentum states), as well as through numerical Gross--Pitaevskii simulations in one and two dimensions. Here, we perform a full mean-field analysis of the system, including all relevant atomic momentum states and the cavity field. We map out the steady-state phase diagram vs pump strength and cavity detuning, and provide an in-depth understanding of the instabilities that are linked to the emergence of spatio-temporal patterns. We find and describe parameter regimes where mean-field predicts bistability, regimes where the dynamics form chaotic trajectories, instabilities caused by resonances between normal mode excitations, and states with atomic dynamics but vanishing cavity field.

Title: Chirality, confinement and dimensionality govern re-entrant transitions in active matter
Authors: Anweshika Pattanayak, Amir Shee, Debasish Chaudhuri, Abhishek Chaudhuri
Abstract: The non-equilibrium dynamics of individual chiral active particles underpin the complex behavior of chiral active matter. Here we present an exact analytical framework, supported by simulations, to characterize the steady states of two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles and three-dimensional torque-driven counterparts in a harmonic trap. Using a Laplace-transform approach of the Fokker-Planck equation, we derive closed-form expressions for displacement moments and excess kurtosis, providing a precise probe of non-Gaussian statistics. Our analysis reveals three distinct regimes: bimodal active states with off-center peaks, Gaussian-like passive states, and weakly heavy-tailed distributions unique to two dimensions. We show that dimensionality plays a decisive role: in two dimensions, increasing chirality suppresses activity and restores passive behavior, while in three dimensions torque preserves activity along the torque axis, producing anisotropic steady states. These behaviors are captured by simple active length-scale arguments that map the boundaries between passive and active phases. Our results offer concrete experimental signatures - including kurtosis crossovers, off-center peaks, and torque-induced anisotropy - that establish confinement as a powerful tool to probe and control chiral and torque-driven active matter.

Title: Speeding up Brownian escape via intermediate finite potential barriers
Authors: Vishwajeet Kumar, Ohad Shpielberg, Arnab Pal
Abstract: The mean first-passage time (MFPT) for a Brownian particle to surmount a potential barrier of height $\Delta U$ is a fundamental quantity governing a wide array of physical and chemical processes. According to the Arrhenius Law, the MFPT typically grows exponentially with increasing barrier height, reflecting the rarity of thermally activated escape events. In this work, we demonstrate that the MFPT can be significantly reduced by reshaping the original single-barrier potential into a structured energy landscape comprising multiple intermediate barriers of lower heights, while keeping the total barrier height $\Delta U$ unchanged. Furthermore, this counterintuitive result holds across both linear and nonlinear potential profiles. Our findings suggest that tailoring the energy landscape -- by introducing well-placed intermediate barriers -- can serve as an effective control strategy to accelerate thermally activated transitions. These predictions are amenable to experimental validation using optical trapping techniques.

Title: Integral $ab$ $initio$/DFT and experimental TDPAC approach enlightening the $aftereffects$ phenomenon: probing electronic properties in $α$-Al$_2$O$_3$:$^{111}$In($\rightarrow$ $^{111}$Cd) at the atomic scale
Authors: G. N. Darriba, R. Vianden, A. P. Ayala, M. Rentería
Abstract: By means of an integral experimental and $ab$ $initio$/DFT approach we contribute here to enlighten and quantify the origin of dynamic hyperfine interactions (HFIs) assigned to the electron-capture (EC) decay aftereffects (ECAE) phenomenon observed in time-differential perturbed $\gamma$-$\gamma$ angular correlation (TDPAC) experiments in oxides doped with ($^{111}$In (EC)$\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd as probe-atom. In previous works [Darriba et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 195201 (2022)] we proposed an $ab$ $initio$ scenario in which the fluctuating electric-field gradients (EFG) producing the dynamic HFI were related with fluctuating electronic environments close to the $^{111}$Cd nucleus, succeeding to identify the environment which produce the final static EFG when the dynamic ($on-off$) process have stopped. In this work we show that in addition it is possible to obtain, for each temperature and HFI observed, the set of initial electronic configurations close to the probe nucleus as well as their related EFGs among which the system fluctuates to generate these dynamic HFIs. For this, we demonstrate analytically and checked experimentally the conditions to stablish the equivalence between the two approaches most used to analyze this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by Bäverstam et al. and by Lupascu et al.. To unravel the unexpected TDPAC results in $^{111}$In($\rightarrow$ $^{111}$Cd)-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals reported in the literature, we perform a complete $ab$ $initio$/DFT study of Cd-doped $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed defect formation energy analysis as a function of the charge state of the Cd impurity. The presence of an unexpected second interaction was a key factor to provide experimental support to identify and quantify the different charge states the $^{111}$Cd atom goes through during its electronic recovery process.

Title: Signatures of emergent surface states across a displacive topological phase transition in Bi$_4$I$_4$

Abstract: Topological phase transitions involving crystalline symmetry breaking provide a fertile ground to explore the interplay between symmetry, topology, and emergent quantum phenomena. Recently discovered quasi-one-dimensional topological material, Bi$_4$I$_4$, has been predicted to host topologically non-trivial gapless surfaces at high temperature, which undergo a finite temperature phase transition to a low temperature gapped phase. Here we present experimental signatures of this room temperature phase transition from a high-temperature $\beta$-phase with a surface state to a gapped $\alpha$-phase hosting hinge states. Using real-space current mapping and resistance fluctuation spectroscopy, we identify signatures of a displacive topological phase transition mediated by a first-order thermodynamic structural change. Near the emergence of $\beta$-phase, we observe pronounced telegraphic noise, indicating fluctuating phase domains with topological surface states. The spatially resolved current map reveals electron transport via the gapless surface states in the $\beta$-phase, which vanishes upon transitioning to the $\alpha$-phase with localized conduction channels (or hinge modes). Our experimental results, supported by first principles estimates and effective theory of a topological displacive phase transition, establish Bi$_4$I$_4$ as a candidate material showing intricate interplay of classical thermodynamic phase transitions with topological quantum phenomena.

Title: Dissipationless dynamics of spin supersolid states in a spin-1/2 triangular antiferromagnet with impurities
Authors: Yixuan Huang, Yuan Gao, Wei Li, Seiji Yunoki, Sadamichi Maekawa
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental observations of possible spin supersolid states in triangular lattice compounds, we study the dynamical properties of various ground states in the spin-1/2 easy-axis antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with impurities under magnetic fields, using numerical Density Matrix Renormalization Group methods. For both spin supersolid states in the low and high fields, the gapless Goldstone mode at the $K$ points remains robust with impurities, which is related to the presence of spin superfluidity. As a comparison, we find a splitting of magnon band at the same impurity density level in the conventional magnetic state, the so-called up-up-down state. In addition, the finite superfluid stiffness probed by the twisted phase in the spin supersolid states is consistent with the excitation spectrum. We argue that this excitation spectrum with impurity provides direct evidence of the dissipationless dynamics in the spin supersolid states, which could be tested in neutron scattering experiments.

Title: Enhanced second-harmonic generation from WS$_2$/ReSe$_2$ heterostructure
Authors: Kanchan Shaikh, Taejun Yoo, Zeyuan Zhu, Qiuyang Li, Amalya C. Johnson, Hui Deng, Fang Liu, Yuki Kobayashi
Abstract: Van der Waals stacking presents new opportunities for nonlinear optics with its remarkable tunability and scalability. However, the fundamental role of interlayer interactions in modifying the overall nonlinear optical susceptibilities remains elusive. In this letter, we report an anisotropic enhancement of second-harmonic generation (SHG) from a WS$_2$/ReSe$_2$ heterobilayer, where the individual composite layers possess distinctive crystal phases. We investigate polarization-resolved response and twist-angle dependence in SHG and reveal that band alignment alone is insufficient to explain the observed anisotropy in the modified SHG response. Spectral shifts in excitonic features highlight band renormalization, supporting the role of hybridization between the two layers. Furthermore, SHG enhancement is highly anisotropic and can even be suppressed in some orientations, suggesting possible intensity-borrowing mechanisms within the heterostructure. Our work demonstrates the ability to tune both the intensity and polarization dependence of nonlinear optical responses with van der Waals stacking of distinctive crystal phases.

Title: Ambient-pressure superconductivity and electronic structures of engineered hybrid nickelate films

Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates have emerged as a crucial platform for exploring the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. However, the Fermi surface topology required for superconductivity remains elusive. Here, we report the thin film growth and ambient-pressure superconductivity of both hybrid monolayer-bilayer (1212) and pure bilayer (2222) structures, together with the absence of superconductivity in hybrid monolayer-trilayer (1313) structure, under identical compressive epitaxial strain. The onset superconducting transition temperature is up to 50 K, exceeding the McMillan limit, in the 1212 structure. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals key Fermi surface differences in these atomically-engineered structures. In superconducting 1212 and 2222 films, a dispersive hole-like band (i.e. the {\gamma} band) crosses the Fermi level, surrounding the Brillouin zone corner. In contrast, the top of the {\gamma} flat band is observed ~70 meV below the Fermi level in the non-superconducting 1313 films. Our findings expand the family of ambient-pressure nickelate superconductors and establish a connection between structural configuration, electronic structure, and the emergence of superconductivity in nickelates.

Title: Control of single spin-flips in a Rydberg atomic fractal
Authors: Robin C. Verstraten, Ivo H. A. Knottnerus, Yu Chih Tseng, Alexander Urech, Tiago Santiago do Espirito Santo, Vinicius Zampronio, Florian Schreck, Robert J. C. Spreeuw, Cristiane Morais Smith
Abstract: Rydberg atoms trapped by optical tweezers have emerged as a versatile platform to emulate lattices with different geometries, in which long-range interacting spins lead to fascinating phenomena, ranging from spin liquids to topological states of matter. Here, we show that when the lattice has a fractal geometry with Hausdorff dimension 1.58, additional surprises appear. The system is described by a transverse-field Ising model with long-range van der Waals interactions in a Sierpinski gasket fractal. We investigate the problem theoretically using exact diagonalization, variational mean field, quantum Monte Carlo, and a graph-based numerical technique, SIM-GRAPH, which we developed. We find that in the quantum regime, the phase diagram exhibits phases in which the spins flip one-by-one. The theoretical results are in excellent agreement with experiments performed with single 88Sr atoms trapped by optical tweezers arranged in a fractal geometry. The magnetization and von Neumann entanglement entropy reveal several regimes in which single spin-flips are delocalized over many sites of one sublattice, thus allowing for an unprecedented control of a cascade of phase transitions in a manybody system. These results expand the possibilities of Rydberg atoms for quantum information processing and may have profound implications in quantum technology.

Title: Rosette formations as symmetry-breaking events: theory and experiment
Authors: Mattia Miotto, Giorgio Gosti, Maria Rosito, Michela Dell'Omo, Viola Folli, Valeria de Turris, Giancarlo Ruocco, Alessandro Rosa, Matteo Paoluzzi
Abstract: Multicellular rosettes are observed in different situations such as morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer progression. While some molecular insights have been gained to explain the presence of these assemblies of five or more cells around a common center, what are the tunable, global features that favors/hinders their formation is still largely unknown. Here, we made use of a Voronoi dynamical model to investigate the ingredients driving the emergence of rosettes characterized by different degree of stability and organization. We found that (i) breaking the local spatial symmetry of the system, i.e., introducing curvature-inducing defects, allows for the formation of rosette-like structures (ii) whose probability of formation depends on the characteristic of the cellular layer. In particular, a trade-off between tissue fluidity and single cell deformability dictates the assembly of transient rosettes, that are strongly stabilized in the presence of cell alignment interactions. To test our model predictions, we performed fluorescence microscopy experiments on rosette-forming neural populations derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, finding significant agreement. Overall, our work may set the stage to gain an unifying understanding of the plethora of biophysical mechanisms involving the occurrence of rosette-like structure both in physiology and their altered formation in pathology.

Title: Anyons in the $π$-flux phase of fermionic matter coupled to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauge field
Authors: Sven Bachmann, Leonardo Goller, Marcello Porta
Abstract: We consider a system of weakly interacting spinful lattice fermions coupled to a dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. The ground state lies in the sector of a uniform $\pi$-flux per plaquette and the monopoles are massive. In the presence of a staggered mass for the fermions, this yields a fully gapped, four-dimensional ground state space on large tori. It is topologically ordered. By considering adiabatic $\pi$-flux insertion, we construct dressed monopole excitations and show that their braiding with the fermionic excitations are those of the toric code.

Authors: Aleksandr E. Kolosov, Volodymyr I. Sivetskii, Elena P. Kolosova, Volodymyr V. Vanin, Aleksandr V. Gondlyakh, Dmytro E. Sidorov, Igor I. Ivitskiy, Volodymyr P. Symoniuk
Abstract: Various aspects of the methods of physical and physicochemical modification of components of filled thermoplastic composite materials are analyzed, aimed at improving the surface properties of the fillers and the technological properties of the polymer matrix during their interaction. It is noted that the improvement of the interfacial interaction of the components of polymer reactoplastic composites, including adhesive strength, is a key factor for improving the reliability of the cured filled composite. As a promising area of research, a modification of the surface of the reinforcing fibrous filler and the technological characteristics of the liquid polymer binder, aimed at increasing their contact properties in the composite, was chosen. The effectiveness of the physical method of modifying the components of composites in the form of low-frequency ultrasonic processing is described. The peculiarities of cluster formation and physicochemical modification of epoxy polymers filled with dispersed fillers are analyzed. Attention is focused on the effectiveness of ultrasonic processing in the cavitation mode for deagglomeration and uniform distribution of nanoparticles in a liquid medium during the creation of nanocomposites. Experimentally confirmed is the improvement of the technological properties of liquid epoxy polymers, modified by ultrasound, used for the impregnation of oriented fibrous fillers, as well as the improvement of the physicomechanical properties of the sonicated epoxy matrices. Some issues of biological modifications of components of polymers for functional application are briefly reviewed.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) printing of bioelectronics offers a versatile platform for fabricating personalized and structurally integrated electronic systems within biological scaffolds. Biodegradable electronics, which naturally dissolve after their functional lifetime, minimize the long-term burden on both patients and healthcare providers by eliminating the need for surgical retrieval. In this study, we developed a library of 3D-printable, biodegradable electronic inks encompassing conductors, semiconductors, dielectrics, thereby enabling the direct printing of fully functional, multi-material, customizable electronic systems in a single integrated process. Especially, conjugated molecules were introduced to improve charge mobility, energy level alignment in semiconducting inks. This ink platform supports the fabrication of passive/active components and physical/chemical sensors making it suitable for complex biomedical applications. Versatility of this system was demonstrated through two representative applications: (i) wireless pressure sensor embedded within biodegradable scaffolds, (ii) wireless electrical stimulators that retain programmable electrical functionality in vivo and degrade post-implantation. This work establishes a foundation of modules for autonomous, biodegradable bioelectronic systems fabricated entirely via 3D printing, with implications for personalized diagnostics, therapeutic interfaces, and transient medical devices.

Abstract: This community paper developed out of the NSF Workshop on the Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Mathematical and Physics Sciences (MPS), which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains (Astronomy, Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics) can best capitalize on, and contribute to, the future of AI. We present here a summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer 2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational institutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to be a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of AI+MPS.

Title: Self-similar kinetics for gravitational Bose-Einstein condensation
Authors: A.S. Dmitriev, D.G. Levkov, A.G. Panin, I.I. Tkachev
Abstract: We study an overpopulated gas of gravitationally interacting bosons surrounding a droplet of Bose-Einstein condensate - Bose star. We argue that kinetic evolution of this gas approaches with time a self-similar attractor solution to the kinetic equation. If the scale symmetry of the equation is broken by external conditions, the attractor solution exists, remains approximately self-similar, but has slowly drifting scaling dimension. The latter new regime of adiabatic self-similarity can determine growth of dark matter Bose stars in cosmological models.

Title: Scattering and induced false vacuum decay in the two-dimensional quantum Ising model
Authors: Luka Pavešić, Marco Di Liberto, Simone Montanger
Abstract: We study scattering in the quantum Ising model in two dimensions. In the ordered phase, the spectrum contains a ladder of bound states and intertwined scattering resonances, which enable various scattering channels. By preparing wave packets on a $24 \times 24$ lattice and evolving the state with tensor networks, we explore and characterize these regimes, ranging from elastic scattering in the perturbative regime, to non-perturbative processes closer to the critical point. Then, we break the spin inversion symmetry and study the stability of the metastable false vacuum state on the collision of its excitations. We find that a highly-energetic scattering process can induce a violent decay of the false vacuum, and investigate the spread of the resulting true vacuum bubble.

Title: Efficient strategy for Parallel Minority Games
Authors: Ankith Reddy Vemula, Soumyajyoti Biswas
Abstract: We study the parallel Minority Game, where a group of agents, each having two choices, try to independently decide on a strategy such that they stay on minority between their own two choices. However, there are multiple such groups of agents, and some of them have common choices. This overlap brings in additional competition among the agents making the variance reduction a complex optimization problem. We study multiple stochastic strategies and find that the most efficient strategy is the one where the agents have just the memory of their last visit to the their alternative choice. The resulting dynamics, even though giving the lowest population variance among the strategies studied here, end up in a frozen state. However, the frozen state does not bring the the variance to its lowest possible value; a situation qualitatively analogous to spin-glass systems.

Title: Conformal bootstrap: from Polyakov to our times
Authors: Slava Rychkov
Abstract: We trace the history of conformal bootstrap from its early days to our times - a great example of unity of physics. We start by describing little-known details about the origins of conformal field theory in the study of strong interactions and critical phenomena in the 1960s and 1970s. We describe similarities and differences between approaches and results of the main groups in Moscow, Rome, and Sofia. Then come the breakthroughs in the 1980s and the 1990s, in particular 2D CFT and holography. Finally, we describe the genesis of the numerical conformal bootstrap, from the conformal technicolor bounds in the 2000s, to the determination of the 3D Ising critical exponents in the 2010s. We conclude with some outstanding challenges. We stress that conformal invariance is a symmetry of nature.

Title: From negligible to neglecton: making Ising anyons braiding universal
Authors: Filippo Iulianelli, Sung Kim, Joshua Sussan, Aaron D. Lauda
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for achieving universal topological quantum computation using Ising anyons via braiding alone. Our approach builds on recent developments in non-semisimple topological quantum field theories in (2+1)-dimensions, which extend the traditional semisimple paradigm. While standard Ising anyons are limited to Clifford operations and thus not computationally universal, we show that their non-semisimple counterparts give rise to new anyon types we call \emph{neglectons}; adding a single neglecton to the traditional Ising theory enables universal quantum computation through braiding alone. The resulting braid group representations are unitary with respect to an indefinite Hermitian form, with the computational subspace embedded in a positive-definite sector. We identify a range of parameters for which the model supports universal gate sets and, notably, special values of the parameter $\alpha$ where the computational subspace decouples exactly from the negative-norm components of the Hilbert space. This leads to low-leakage, fully unitary evolution on the physical subspace and improved prospects for efficient gate compilation.

Title: Geometric analysis of Ising models, Part III
Authors: Michael Aizenman
Abstract: The random current representation of the Ising model, along with a related path expansion, has been a source of insight on the stochastic geometric underpinning of the ferromagnetic model's phase structure and critical behavior in different dimensions. This representation is extended in this work to systems with a mild amount of frustration, such as generated by disorder operators and external field of mixed signs. Further examples of the utility of stochastic geometric representations are presented here in the context of the deconfinement transition of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge model -- particularly in three dimensions -- and in streamlined proofs of correlation inequalities with wide-ranging applications.

Title: PDRL: Post-hoc Descriptor-based Residual Learning for Uncertainty-Aware Machine Learning Potentials
Authors: Shih-Peng Huang, Nontawat Charoenphakdee, Yuta Tsuboi, Yong-Bin Zhuang, Wenwen Li
Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty quantification (UQ) for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their effectiveness and limitations.

Title: Quantum optical reset with classical memory
Authors: Evgeniy O. Kiktenko, Oleg M. Sotnikov, Ilia A. Iakovlev, Yuri A. Biriukov, Aleksey K. Fedorov, Stanislav S. Straupe, Ivan V. Dyakonov, Vladimir V. Mazurenko
Abstract: Dynamic quantum circuits generate states that depend on the measurement results obtained during circuit execution. To date such a quantum computing model has mainly been implemented with qubit-based superconducting hardware utilizing reset operations and classical logic. Here we develop a model of optical reset by using time-bin self-looped interferometers demonstrated in recent experiments. Synchronizing the optical reset with a simple classical device storing history of measurement results allows one to decrease uncertainty of future measurements, which suggests unprecedented flexibility in constructing dynamical circuits on optical platforms. We reveal and characterize information flow in the proposed reset model with distinct information-theoretic measures.

Title: Identifiability and minimality bounds of quantum and post-quantum models of classical stochastic processes
Authors: Paul M. Riechers, Thomas J. Elliott
Abstract: To make sense of the world around us, we develop models, constructed to enable us to replicate, describe, and explain the behaviours we see. Focusing on the broad case of sequences of correlated random variables, i.e., classical stochastic processes, we tackle the question of determining whether or not two different models produce the same observable behavior. This is the problem of identifiability. Curiously, the physics of the model need not correspond to the physics of the observations; recent work has shown that it is even advantageous -- in terms of memory and thermal efficiency -- to employ quantum models to generate classical stochastic processes. We resolve the identifiability problem in this regime, providing a means to compare any two models of a classical process, be the models classical, quantum, or `post-quantum', by mapping them to a canonical `generalized' hidden Markov model. Further, this enables us to place (sometimes tight) bounds on the minimal dimension required of a quantum model to generate a given classical stochastic process.

Title: Tilted Dirac cones and their topology in Holographic Materials
Authors: Jeong-Won Seo, Taewon Yuk, Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We explore strongly correlated materials with tilted Dirac cone by introducing a method to realize this spectral feature within a holographic setup. Following the work by Moradpouri et al., we construct an asymptotically AdS spacetime by uplifting the vielbein of Volovik et al to tilt the flat spacetime light cone. We then couple the resulting metric to holographic fermions and compute their spectral functions, confirming the presence of a tilted Dirac cone in momentum space. We also calculate the topological number using the holographic Green's function and find that the Chern number is independent of the tilting parameter. Additionally, we show that the optical conductivity exhibits a Drude peak even at zero chemical potential, revealing nontrivial strong-coupling effects absent in field-theoretic models.

Title: Theory of dynamical superradiance in organic materials
Authors: Lukas Freter, Piper Fowler-Wright, Javier Cuerda, Brendon W. Lovett, Jonathan Keeling, Päivi Törmä
Abstract: We develop the theory of dynamical superradiance -- the collective exchange of energy between an ensemble of initially excited emitters and a single-mode cavity -- for organic materials where electronic states are coupled to vibrational modes. We consider two models to capture the vibrational effects: first, vibrations treated as a Markovian bath for two-level emitters, via a pure dephasing term in the Lindblad master equation for the system; second, vibrational modes directly included in the system via the Holstein--Tavis--Cummings Hamiltonian. By exploiting the permutation symmetry of the emitters and weak U(1) symmetry, we develop a numerical method capable of exactly solving the Tavis-Cummings model with local dissipation for up to 140 emitters. Using the exact method, we validate mean-field and second-order cumulant approximations and use them to describe macroscopic numbers of emitters. We analyse the dynamics of the average cavity photon number, electronic coherence, and Bloch vector length, and show that the effect of vibrational mode coupling goes beyond simple dephasing. Our results show that superradiance is possible in the presence of vibrational mode coupling; for negative cavity detunings, the vibrational coupling may even enhance superradiance. We identify asymmetry of the photon number rise time as a function of the detuning of the cavity frequency as an experimentally accessible signature of such vibrationally assisted superradiance.

Title: Narwhals and their blessings: exact coherent structures of elastic turbulence in channel flows
Authors: Alexander Morozov, Martin Lellep, Damiano Capocci, Moritz Linkmann
Abstract: Solutions of long, flexible polymer molecules are complex fluids that simultaneously exhibit fluid-like and solid-like behaviour. When subjected to external flows, dilute polymer solutions develop elastic turbulence - a unique chaotic flow state absent in Newtonian fluids such as water. Unlike turbulence in Newtonian fluids, elastic turbulence arises from polymer stretching and alignment in the flow, and can occur even at vanishing inertia. While experimental realisations of elastic turbulence are well documented, its underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present a perspective on the transition to elastic turbulence in pressure-driven channel flows, drawing on recent computational work from our group. We outline our current understanding of the transition in both two and three spatial dimensions, centred on two key building blocks: (i) narwhals, exact coherent states of the flow, and (ii) blessings, spatio-temporal intermittent states made up of several localised narwhal solutions. This contribution is based on a talk given by one of us (A.M.) at the 2024 APS DFD meeting.

Title: Ultrafast Optical Probing of Laser Processing
Authors: Jörn Bonse
Abstract: Laser treatment has emerged into a cornerstone of industrial manufacturing. This creates the demand to understand in detail the involved physical processes and their dynamics, to control the process, and to keep guard in-situ the laser manufacturing steps. Given the contactless interaction of light with matter, particularly optical methods appear most suitable for probing laser processing. This chapter reviews the current scientific and technological state of analyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical pulses. For that, sequential passive interrogation of material properties (via reflection, absorption, scattering, diffraction, interference, or specific nonlinear responses) can be employed through so-called pump-probe techniques (where the time-resolution is not given by the detector response time but by the duration of an electromagnetic probe pulse that is interrogating the transient scenery at a controlled delay (typ. fs to \mu s) with respect to the arrival of the pump laser pulse). These approaches are capable to analyze on microscopic to macroscopic scales a plethora of different processes involved in laser processing, such as heating, melting, ablation, plasma- and shockwave-formation, optical breakdown in surrounding liquids and gases, shielding and accumulation effects, surface solidification and restructuring, etc. A special focus is set on the variety of ultrafast optical imaging schemes for visualizing the dynamics of laser processing at the surface and in the bulk of the irradiated materials, including photography and microscopy, holography, tomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging. The chapter provides a historic survey, highlights important scientific and technological developments and breakthroughs, discusses selected applications, explores the requirements and current limitations, and sheds light on emerging future trends.

Title: Parquet theory for molecular systems. I. Formalism and static kernel parquet approximation
Authors: Antoine Marie, Pierre-François Loos
Abstract: The $GW$ approximation has become a method of choice for predicting quasiparticle properties in solids and large molecular systems, owing to its favorable accuracy-cost balance. However, its accuracy is the result of a fortuitous cancellation of vertex corrections in the polarizability and self-energy. Hence, when attempting to go beyond $GW$ through inclusion of vertex corrections, the accuracy can deteriorate if this delicate balance is disrupted. In this work, we explore an alternative route that theoretically goes beyond $GW$: the parquet formalism. Unlike approaches that focus on a single correlation channel, such as the electron-hole channel in $GW$ or the particle-particle channel in $T$-matrix theory, parquet theory treats all two-body scattering channels on an equal footing. We present the formal structure of the parquet equations, which couple the one-body Green's function, the self-energy, and the two-body vertex. We discuss the approximations necessary to solve this set of equations, the advantages and limitations of this approach, outline its implementation for molecular systems, and assess its accuracy for principal ionization potentials of small molecular systems.

Title: Detection of noise correlations in two qubit systems by Machine Learning
Authors: Dario Fasone, Shreyasi Mukherjee, Dario Penna, Fabio Cirinnà, Mauro Paternostro, Elisabetta Paladino, Luigi Giannelli, Giuseppe A. Falci
Abstract: We introduce and validate a machine-learning assisted quantum sensing protocol to classify spatial and temporal correlations of classical noise affecting two ultrastrongly coupled qubits. We consider six distinct classes of Markovian and non-Markovian noise. Leveraging the sensitivity of a coherent population transfer protocol under three distinct driving conditions, the various forms of noise are discriminated by only measuring the final transfer efficiencies. Our approach achieves $\gtrsim 86\%$ accuracy in classification providing a near-perfect discrimination between Markovian and non-Markovian noise. The method requires minimal experimental resources, relying on a simple driving scheme providing three inputs to a shallow neural network with no need of measuring time-series data or real-time monitoring. The machine-learning data analysis acquires information from non-idealities of the coherent protocol highlighting how combining these techniques may significantly improve the characterization of quantum-hardware.

Title: Universal representation of the long-range entanglement in the family of Toric Code states
Authors: Mohammad Hossein Zarei, Mohsen Rahmani Haghighi
Abstract: Since the long range entanglement is a universal characteristic of topological quantum states belonging to the same class, a suitable mathematical representation of the long range entanglement has to be also universal. In this Letter, we introduce such a representation for the family of Toric Code states by using Kitaev's Ladders as building blocks. We consider Toric Code states corresponding to various planar graphs and apply non-local dientanglers to qubits corresponding to non-contractible cycles that satisfy a topological constraint. We demonstrate that, independent of the geometry of the underlying graph, disentanglers convert Toric Code states into a tensor product of Kitaev's Ladder states. Since Kitaev's Ladders with arbitrary geometric configurations include the short-range entanglements, we conclude that the above universal and non-local pattern of entanglement between ladders is responsible of the long-range entanglement inherent in Toric Code states. Our result emphasizes in the capability of such non-local representations to describe topological order in ground-state wave functions of topological quantum systems.

Title: Ultrafast single-photon interference with a dipole qubit in a nanocavity
Authors: Athul S. Rema, Adrián E. Rubio López, Felipe Herrera
Abstract: The stationary spectrum of individual dipole emitters in plasmonic nanocavities has been studied for a range of cavity geometries and dipole configurations. Less is known about the coherent dynamics of single photon creation in the nanocavity near field by an excited dipole. We address this gap by developing a Lorentzian kernel approximation that solves the time-dependent Schrödinger equation that describes the coupled dipole-photon dynamics in the single-excitation manifold. Our approach encodes the broadband nature of the nanocavity field through a non-Markovian memory kernel, derived from macroscopic QED theory. For a two-level dipole near a metallic nanosphere, we show that the single photon probability density in frequency space evolves in strong coupling from an initially localized source at the qubit frequency into a Rabi doublet over a timescale governed by the kernel spectrum. This dynamical crossover is accompanied by the formation of single-photon interference patterns in frequency and time, propagating coherently over a timescale limited by the shape of kernel spectrum to $\sim 100-150$ fs, which is accessible to ultrafast spectroscopy. We also show that the stationary spectrum of the coupled system can be manipulated by driving the nanocavity field using coherent pulses with variable spectral bandwidth. Using single-photon pulses narrower than the kernel spectrum, the Rabi splitting in a system that supports strong coupling can be effectively removed. The applicability of our results to other dipole-nanocavity configurations is discussed and a general strong coupling criterion for nanocavities is formulated.

Title: Observation of Universal Expansion Anisotropy from Cold Atoms to Hot Quark-Gluon Plasma
Authors: Ke Li, Hong-Fang Song, Hao-Jie Xu, Yu-Liang Sun, Fuqiang Wang
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy has been ubiquitously observed in high-energy proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus (heavy-ion) collisions, shaking the early belief that those anisotropies require an intense phase of multiple interactions between the created particles. This work reports a study of anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in an anisotropic potential, as a function of the interaction strength that can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. It is found that the expansion anisotropy builds up quickly at small interaction strength, without the need of a large amount of interactions. An unexpected and quantitative universal scaling of the expansion anisotropy is observed for the first time between cold atom and heavy-ion systems as a function of the number of collisions per particle or opacity ($n_{\rm coll}$), despite their vast differences in scale and physics. The expansion isotropy in both the cold atom gases and heavy-ion collisions increases smoothly and shows no sign of saturation in the observed opacity range, with an approximate power-law dependence of $\sqrt{n_{\rm coll}}$, characteristic of random walks. This universality potentially unifies a variety of vastly different physical systems, from weakly interacting dilute gases to the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma of the early universe.

Title: High-efficiency microwave photodetection by cavity coupled double dots with single cavity-photon sensitivity
Authors: Subhomoy Haldar, Harald Havir, Waqar Khan, Drilon Zenelaj, Patrick P. Potts, Sebastian Lehmann, Kimberly A. Dick, Peter Samuelsson, Ville F. Maisi
Abstract: We present a superconducting cavity-coupled double quantum dot (DQD) photodiode that achieves a maximum photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 25% in the microwave domain. With a higher-quality-factor cavity and improved device design to prevent photon leakages through unwanted pathways, our device measures microwave signals down to 100 aW power level and achieves sensitivity to probe microwave signals with one photon at a time in the cavity. We analyze the photodiode operation using Jaynes-Cummings input-output theory, identifying the key improvements of stronger cavity-DQD coupling needed to achieve near-unity photodetection efficiency. The results presented in this work represent a crucial advancement toward near unity microwave photodetection efficiency with single cavity-photon sensitivity for studies of photon statistics in the microwave range and applications related to quantum information processing.

Title: Distinct effect of Kondo physics on crystal field splitting in electron and spin spectroscopies
Authors: M. Kornjača, R. Flint
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy is a key feature of rare earth materials from permanent magnets to heavy fermions. We explore the complex interplay of Kondo physics and anisotropy, and their effect on different experimental probes of magnetic anisotropy in a minimal J = 3/2 Anderson impurity model using numerical renormalization group. While anisotropy suppresses Kondo screening, virtual valence fluctuations enhance the anisotropy. We find distinct renormalization of the magnetic anisotropy measured via dynamical spin response (inelastic neutron scattering) versus electronic excitations in the impurity spectral function (resonant inelastic x-rays and scanning tunneling spectroscopy). The two measurement types have different responses and dependences on the temperature and Kondo scales.

Title: Anisotropic Spin Stripe Domains in Bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has motivated the investigation of a parent spin density wave (SDW) state, which could provide the underlying pairing interaction. Here, we employ resonant soft x-ray scattering and polarimetry on thin films of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to determine that the magnetic structure of the SDW forms unidirectional diagonal spin stripes with moments lying within the NiO$_2$ plane and perpendicular to $\mathbf{Q}_{SDW}$, but without evidence of the strong charge disproportionation typically associated with other nickelates. These stripes form anisotropic domains with shorter correlation lengths perpendicular versus parallel to $\mathbf{Q}_{SDW}$, revealing nanoscale rotational and translational symmetry breaking analogous to the cuprate and Fe-based superconductors, with possible Bloch-like antiferromagnetic domain walls separating orthogonal domains.

Title: Anisotropic conductivity for the type-I and type-II phases of Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall set-ups
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We compute the non-Drude part of the conductivity tensor in planar Hall set-ups, for tilted Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals, considering both the type-I and type-II phases. We do so in three distinct set-ups, taking into account the possible relative orientations of the plane spanned by the electric and magnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt-axis. We derive the analytical expressions for the response tensor, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), both of which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the three-dimensional manifold defined by the Brillouin zone. We exhibit the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the nonzero components of the magnetoelectric conductivity, and outline whether the contributions from the former or the latter dominate the overall response. Our results also show that, depending on the configuration of the planar Hall set-up, one may or may not get terms which have a linear-in-$ B$ dependence.

Title: Anyon Superconductivity from Topological Criticality in a Hofstadter-Hubbard Model
Authors: Stefan Divic, Valentin Crépel, Tomohiro Soejima, Xue-Yang Song, Andrew J. Millis, Michael P. Zaletel, Ashvin Vishwanath
Abstract: We argue that the combination of strong repulsive interactions and high magnetic fields can generate electron pairing and superconductivity. Inspired by the large lattice constants of moiré materials, which make large flux per unit cell accessible at laboratory fields, we study the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette, where previous literature has argued that a chiral spin liquid separates a weak-coupling integer quantum Hall phase and a strong-coupling topologically-trivial antiferromagnetic insulator at a density of one electron per site. We argue that topological superconductivity emerges upon doping in the vicinity of the integer quantum Hall to chiral spin liquid transition. We employ exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods to examine this theoretical scenario and find that electronic pairing indeed occurs on both sides of criticality over a remarkably broad range of interaction strengths. On the chiral spin liquid side, our results provide a concrete model realization of the long-hypothesized mechanism of anyon superconductivity. Our study thus establishes a beyond-BCS mechanism for electron pairing in a well-controlled limit, relying crucially on the interplay between electron correlations and band topology.

Title: Fermi surface and pseudogap in highly doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$

Abstract: The fate of the Fermi surface in bulk electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ remains elusive, as does the origin and extension of its pseudogap phase. Here, we use high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_{2-x}$La$_{x}$IrO$_{4}$ up to $x=0.2$, a factor of two higher than in previous work. We find that the antinodal pseudogap persists up to the highest doping level, and thus beyond the sharp increase in Hall carrier density to $\simeq 1+x$ recently observed above $x^{*}\simeq 0.16$ [Y.-T. Hsu et al., Nature Physics 20, 1593 (2024)]. This suggests that doped iridates host a unique phase of matter in which a large Hall density coexists with an anisotropic pseudogap, breaking up the Fermi surface into disconnected arcs. The temperature boundary of the pseudogap is $T^{*}\simeq 200$ K for $x=0.2$, comparable to cuprates and to the energy scale of short range antiferromagnetic correlations in cuprates and iridates.

Title: The Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a binary quantum fluid
Authors: Yanda Geng, Junheng Tao, Mingshu Zhao, Shouvik Mukherjee, Stephen Eckel, Gretchen K. Campbell, Ian B. Spielman
Abstract: Instabilities, where small fluctuations seed the formation of large-scale structures, govern dynamics in a variety of fluid systems. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI), present from tabletop to astronomical scales, is an iconic example characterized by mushroom-shaped incursions appearing when immiscible fluids are forced together. Despite its ubiquity, RTI experiments are challenging; here, we report the observation of the RTI in an immiscible binary superfluid consisting of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We force these components together to initiate the instability, and observe the growth of mushroom-like structures. The interface can also be stabilized, allowing us to spectroscopically measure the "ripplon" interface modes. Lastly, we use matter-wave interferometry to transform the superfluid velocity field at the interface into a vortex chain. These results-in agreement with our theory-demonstrate the close connection between the RTI in classical and quantum fluids.

Title: Emergence of a Landau level structure in dark optical lattices
Authors: Sylvain Nascimbene, Jean Dalibard
Abstract: An optical flux lattice is a set of light beams that couple different internal states of an atom, thereby producing topological energy bands. Here we present a configuration in which the atoms exhibit a dark state, i.e. an internal state that is not coupled to the light. At large light intensity, the low-energy dynamics is restricted to the dark state, leading to an effective continuum model with a Landau-level-like structure. This structure is dramatically different from that of usual topological optical lattices, which lead to discrete models in the tight-binding limit. For well-chosen atomic species, the proposed system is essentially immune to heating due to photon scattering, making it a highly promising way to emulate the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect.

Title: Evidence for spin liquid behavior in the frustrated three-dimensional $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg garnet NaCa$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$(VO$_{4}$)$_{3}$

Abstract: Three-dimensional quantum spin liquids have remained elusive, hindered by reduced quantum fluctuations from larger lattice connectivity inherent to high-dimensional systems. Here, we investigate the remarkable persistence of dynamical short-range magnetic correlations in the nearly body-centered cubic garnet NaCa$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$(VO$_{4}$)$_{3}$ down to $T = 50$ mK, two orders of magnitude below its Curie-Weiss temperature. Using a combination of neutron and muon spectroscopies plus numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a dynamical regime emerges, characterized by a dual response in the inelastic spectrum composed of short-live dispersive excitations and a quasi-elastic component. Strongly frustrated exchange interactions combined with subtle temperature-dependent Jahn-Teller spin-lattice effects are a plausible mechanism to explain the origin of this spin-liquid behavior.

Title: Superconductivity and normal-state transport in compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ thin films
Authors: Yidi Liu, Eun Kyo Ko, Yaoju Tarn, Lopa Bhatt, Berit H. Goodge, David A. Muller, Srinivas Raghu, Yijun Yu, Harold Y. Hwang
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity under high pressure in Ruddlesden-Popper phases of bulk nickelates has sparked great interest in stabilizing ambient pressure superconductivity in thin-film form using epitaxial strain. Recently, signs of superconductivity have been observed in compressively strained bilayer nickelate thin films with an onset temperature exceeding 40 K, albeit with broad and two-step-like transitions. Here, we report intrinsic superconductivity and normal-state transport properties in compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ thin films, achieved through a combination of isovalent Pr substitution, growth optimization, and precision ozone annealing. The superconducting onset occurs above 48 K, with zero resistance reached above 30 K, and the critical current density at 1.4 K is 100-fold larger than previous reports. The normal-state resistivity exhibits quadratic temperature dependence indicative of Fermi liquid behaviour, and other phenomenological similarities to transport in overdoped cuprates suggest parallels in their emergent properties.

Title: Principled model selection for stochastic dynamics
Authors: Andonis Gerardos, Pierre Ronceray
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems, from macromolecules to ecosystems, are often modeled by stochastic differential equations. To learn such models from data, a common approach involves sparse selection among a large function library. However, we show that overfitting arises not just from individual model complexity, but also from the combinatorial growth of possible models. To address this, we introduce Parsimonious Stochastic Inference (PASTIS), a principled method combining likelihood-estimation statistics with extreme value theory to suppress superfluous parameters. PASTIS outperforms existing methods and reliably identifies minimal models, even with low sampling rates or measurement error. It extends to stochastic partial differential equations, and applies to ecological networks and reaction-diffusion dynamics.

Title: Keldysh field theory approach to direct electric and thermoelectric currents in quantum dots coupled to superconducting leads
Authors: Marco Uguccioni, Luca Dell'Anna
Abstract: We study the transport properties of a quantum dot contacted to two superconducting reservoirs by means of the Keldysh field theory approach, showing how this technique allows us to straightforwardly recover previous results, resulting extremely effective in dealing with quantum transport problems. In particular, we determine the direct current occurring at equilibrium and the electric and thermoelectric currents triggered when the system is driven out of equilibrium by a voltage or a temperature bias, also for a normal-quantum dot-superconductor junction. The main result of the work is the derivation of the full expression for the thermoelectric current in a superconductor-quantum dot-superconductor junction for any values of the temperature difference between the superconducting leads. We show that in the linear response regime, in addition to the Josephson current, a weakly phase-dependent thermoelectric contribution occurs, provided that electron-hole symmetry is broken. Far from linearity, instead, other contributions arise which lead to thermoelectric effects, dominant at weak coupling, also in the presence of particle-hole symmetry.

Title: The Saga of $α$-RuCl$_3$: Parameters, Models, and Phase Diagrams
Authors: Marius Möller, P. A. Maksimov, Shengtao Jiang, Steven R. White, Roser Valenti, A. L. Chernyshev
Abstract: RuCl$_3$ was likely the first ever deliberately synthesized ruthenium compound, following the discovery of the $_{44}$Ru element in 1844. For a long time it was known as an oxidation catalyst, with its physical properties being discrepant and confusing, until a decade ago when its allotropic form $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rose to exceptional prominence. This "re-discovery" of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has not only reshaped the hunt for a material manifestation of the Kitaev spin liquid, but it has opened the floodgates of theoretical and experimental research in the many unusual phases and excitations that the anisotropic-exchange magnets as a class of compounds have to offer. Given its importance for the field of Kitaev materials, it is astonishing that the low-energy spin model that describes this compound and its possible proximity to the much-desired spin-liquid state is still a subject of significant debate ten years later. In the present study, we argue that the existing key phenomenological observations put strong natural constraints on the effective microscopic spin model of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and specifically on its spin-orbit-induced anisotropic-exchange parameters that are responsible for the non-trivial physical properties of this material. These constraints allow one to focus on the relevant region of the multi-dimensional phase diagram of the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ model, suggest an intuitive description of it via a different parametrization of the exchange matrix, offer a unifying view on the earlier assessments of its parameters, and bring closer together several approaches to the derivation of anisotropic-exchange models. We explore extended phase diagrams relevant to the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ parameter space using quasi-classical, Luttinger-Tisza, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix renormalization group methods, demonstrating a remarkably c...

Title: Quantum geometry and low-frequency optical conductivity of nodal planes
Authors: Raymond Wiedmann, Kirill Alpin, Moritz M. Hirschmann, Andreas P. Schnyder
Abstract: Nodal planes, two-dimensional symmetry-enforced band crossings, can carry a topological charge, similar to Weyl points. While the transport properties of Weyl points are well understood, those of nodal planes remain largely unexplored. These properties are influenced not only by the Berry curvature, but also by other quantum geometric quantities. In this work we study the quantum geometry - specifically the Berry curvature and quantum metric - and the linear optical conductivity of topological nodal planes. We introduce a low-energy model and investigate its low-frequency optical responses to determine the unique signatures of nodal planes. By comparing these findings to the optical response in a tight-binding model with a topological nodal plane, we observe consistent low-frequency behavior with a cubic power law. This paves the way for the experimental detection of nodal planes through optical conductivity measurements for which we suggest suitable materials, most promisingly the material group $X$Mo$_3$S$_3$ ($X$ = Rb, K, Cs).

Title: Large deviations of density fluctuations in the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process
Authors: Denis Bernard, Tony Jin, Stefano Scopa, Shiyi Wei
Abstract: We consider the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process (QSSIP) which describes a one-dimensional system of bosonic particles with stochastic nearest-neighbor hopping, modeled as a Brownian motion, with gain/loss processes at the endpoints of the chain driving the system out-of-equilibrium. Although the averaged QSSIP dynamics differs from that of the Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (QSSEP) - the analogous system where bosons are replaced by fermions - we show that, paradoxically, the dynamics of their matrices of two-point functions, along with all their fluctuations, coincide. In contrary, the underlying classical models differs significantly, as the bosonic statistics allow the inclusion of multiple particles at the same site, in contrast to (symmetric) simple exclusion processes (SSEP). We provide an exact derivation of the large deviation function of density fluctuations in QSSIP and, as a consequence, in the classical inclusion process (SSIP) by exploiting its quantum formulation. Remarkably, our study highlights that, both in QSSEP and QSSIP, fluctuations of the local densities are typically classical, i.e. the cumulant generating functions of the local densities are asymptotically self-averaging and converge toward those of the classical SSEP and SSIP, realization-wise. This provides a test of the conjectured almost sure classical behavior of transport fluctuations, at leading order in the system size, in noisy diffusive quantum many-body systems.

Title: Unexpected collapse of edge reconstruction in compressible Quantum Hall fluid within filling fraction range 2/3 to 1
Authors: Suvankar Purkait, Tanmay Maiti, Pooja Agarwal, Suparna Sahoo, Giorgio Biasiol, Lucia Sorba, Biswajit Karmakar
Abstract: The edge structure of a gate-defined compressible quantum Hall fluids in the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 is studied using the three reconstructed $e^2/3h$ fractional edge modes of unity filling integer quantum Hall state. We find that the individually excited partially resolved $e^2/3h$ edge modes of the bulk state equilibrate completely even at higher magnetic field when passing through the gate defined compressible fluid with filling between 2/3 and 1. This result is unexpected because edge reconstruction at the smooth boundary is generally expected due to dominant incompressibility at filling 2/3 and 1/3. Recently such reconstructed edge mode has been reported for the compressible fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3. In contrary, equilibration of fractional edge modes in the compressible fluid within the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 becomes faster with increasing magnetic field. This anomalous results will stimulate further investigations on edge structure in these complex many body systems.

Authors: Matthew Kafker, Xerxes D. Arsiwalla
Abstract: We investigate the response of a system of hard spheres to two classes of perturbations over a range of densities spanning the fluid, crystalline, and glassy regimes within a molecular dynamics framework. Firstly, we consider the relaxation of a "thermal inhomogeneity," in which a central region of particles is given a higher temperature than its surroundings and is then allowed to evolve under Newtonian dynamics. In this case, the hot central "core" of particles expands and collides with the cold surrounding material, creating a transient radially-expanding "compression wave," which is rapidly dissipated by particle-particle collisions and interaction with periodic images at the boundary, leading to a rapid relaxation to equilibrium. Secondly, we consider a rapid compression of the spheres into a disordered glassy state at high densities. Such rapidly compressed systems exhibit very slow structural relaxation times, many orders of magnitude longer than thermalization times for simple temperature inhomogeneities. We find that thermal relaxation of the velocity distribution is determined simply by the total collision rate, whereas structural relaxation requires coordinated collective motion, which is strongly suppressed at high density, although some particle rearrangement nevertheless occurs. We further find that collisions propagate significantly faster through glassy systems than through crystalline systems at the same density, which leads to very rapid relaxation of velocity perturbations, although structural relaxation remains very slow. These results extend the validity of previous observations that glassy systems exhibit a hybrid character, sharing features with both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we introduce the hard sphere causal graph, a network-based characterization of the dynamical history of a hard sphere system, which encapsulates several useful...

Title: Finite-strain constitutive model for shape memory alloys formulated in the logarithmic strain space

Abstract: This work presents a finite-strain version of an established three-dimensional constitutive model for polycrystalline shape memory alloys (SMA) that is able to account for the large deformations and rotations that SMA components may undergo. The model is constructed by applying the logarithmic strain space approach to the original small-strain model, which was formulated within the Generalized Standard Materials framework and features a refined dissipation (rate) function. Additionally, the free energy function is augmented to be more versatile in capturing the transformation kinetics. The model is implemented into finite element software. To demonstrate the model performance and validate the implementation, material parameters are fitted to the experimental data of two SMA, and two computational simulations of SMA components are conducted. The applied approach is highly flexible from the perspective of the future incorporation of other phenomena, e.g., irreversibility associated with plasticity, into the model.

Title: Fractonic Fractional Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Justin Schirmann, Peru d'Ornellas, Charles Stahl, Adolfo G. Grushin
Abstract: In non-interacting systems, disorder can drive a trivial phase into a topological one. However little is known how to construct a fractional quantum Hall ground-state, a paradigmatic topologically ordered state, that exists both in crystalline and disordered lattices and is qualitatively different to known topological phases. Here, we propose a general method for building such a phase. This is done by coupling quantum wires placed aperiodically in real-space, where the spatial positioning allows us to tune the inter-wire couplings. We call the emergent phase the Fractonic Fractional Quantum Hall Effect as it displays a rich interplay of fractional quantum Hall physics with fractonic constraints, formed by coupling differently-fractionalised wires into a globally gapped phase. The ground state has an exponential degeneracy in system size, a signature of the emergence of fractons. It displays a rich phenomenology of excitations, which can either behave like anyons confined to move in one dimension (lineons), multiples of which can then hop between two wires (s-lineons) or be free to travel across the system (C-anyons), depending on the multiplicity. Both the ground state degeneracy and mutual statistics are directly determined by the real-space positions of the wires, which can be disordered. Our method provides an analytically solvable pathway to non-crystalline fractional quantum Hall effects and fractonic theories in two-dimensions, examples of which were lacking.

Title: High frequency permeability of the composite with ferromagnetic spherical shells
Authors: A.O. Sboychakov
Abstract: The paper studies high-frequency permeability of the composite materials consisting of hollow ferromagnetic particles embedded into the non-magnetic media. We model the ferromagnetic particles in composite by spherical shells: the thickness of the ferromagnetic region $d$ compared to the particles' diameter $D$ can vary in a wide range, from $d\ll D$ to $d\sim D$. We assume that the magnetization distribution in such a particle is non-uniform, but forms a vortex-like structure: the magnetization is twisted in some plane outside two vortex cores placed at the poles of the particle. We consider two types of magnetic anisotropy, which help to stabilize such a magnetic configuration: the easy-plane magnetic anisotropy and the ``circular'' uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with easy axis rotated together with the magnetization direction outside the vortex core. The high-frequency permeability of such a composite material has been studied in the limit of non-interacting particles. We study the dependence of the permeability on the ratio $d/D$. We showed that for $d\sim D$ the composite's permeability behaves in similar manner for both types of magnetic anisotropy. It was shown also that for the second type of magnetic anisotropy and in the limit $d/D\ll1$ the frequency dependence of the particle's susceptibility is quite similar to that for the thin film. At the same time, the magnetization oscillations in the ac field are non-homogeneous for both types of anisotropy.

Title: Spectrum Selective Interfaces and Materials towards Non-photothermal Saltwater Evaporation: Demonstration with a White Ceramic Wick
Authors: Navindra D. Singh, James Leung, Ji Feng, Alma K. González-Alcalde, Arial Tolentino, David Tuft, Juchen Guo, Luat T. Vuong
Abstract: Most solar desalination efforts are photothermal: they evaporate water with ``black'' materials that absorb as much sunlight as possible. Such ``brine-boiling'' methods are limited by the high thermal mass of water, i.e., its capacity to store and release heat. Here, we study the light-enhanced evaporation by a hard, white, aluminum nitride wick, and propose a route to selectively target salt-water bonds instead of bulk heating via deep-UV interactions. Through experiments and analyses that isolate the effects of light absorption and heating in aluminum nitride, we provide experimental evidence of a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation. Leverage of these light-matter interactions in white ceramic wicks may achieve low-cost, low-energy desalination, reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies, and contribute to new cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.

Title: Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional line-gapped non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics
Authors: Xiao-Dong Lin, Long Zhang
Abstract: The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems with real line gaps through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band-inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. The framework is also generalized to imaginary line-gapped topological phases. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.

Title: Reentrant localization in a quasiperiodic chain with correlated hopping sequences
Authors: Sourav Karmakar, Sudin Ganguly, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems are known to exhibit localization transitions in low dimensions, wherein all electronic states become localized beyond a critical disorder strength. Interestingly, recent studies have uncovered a reentrant localization (RL) phenomenon: upon further increasing the quasiperiodic modulation strength beyond the localization threshold, a subset of previously localized states can become delocalized again within a specific parameter window. While RL transitions have been primarily explored in systems with simple periodic modulations, such as dimerized or long-range hopping integrals, the impact of more intricate or correlated hopping structures on RL behavior remains largely elusive. In this work, we investigate the localization behavior in a one-dimensional lattice featuring staggered, correlated on-site potentials following the Aubry-André-Harper model, along with off-diagonal hopping modulations structured according to quasiperiodic Fibonacci and Bronze Mean sequences. By systematically analyzing the fractal dimension, inverse participation ratio, and normalized participation ratio, we demonstrate the occurrence of RL transitions induced purely by the interplay between quasiperiodic on-site disorder and correlated hopping. We further examine the parameter space to determine the specific regimes that give rise to RL. Our findings highlight the crucial role of underlying structural correlations in governing localization-delocalization transitions in low-dimensional quasiperiodic systems, where the correlated disorder manifests in both diagonal and off-diagonal terms.

Title: Deterministic Switching of the Néel Vector by Asymmetric Spin Torque
Authors: Shui-Sen Zhang, Zi-An Wang, Bo Li, Wen-Jian Lu, Mingliang Tian, Yu-Ping Sun, Haifeng Du, Ding-Fu Shao
Abstract: Néel vector, the order parameter of collinear antiferromagnets, serves as a state variable in associated antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronic devices to encode information. A deterministic switching of Néel vector is crucial for the write-in operation, which, however, remains a challenging problem in AFM spintronics. Here we demonstrate, based on analytical derivation and macro-spin simulations, that Néel vector switching can be generally achieved via a current-induced spin torque, provided the spin accumulations responsible for this torque are non-identical between opposite sublattices. This condition occurs widely in AFM films, as symmetry equivalence between sublattice-dependent spin accumulations is usually absent, allowing unequal spin accumulations induced by Edelstein effect or a spin current. Unlike previously studied spin torques induced by uniform or staggered spin accumulations -- where either the field-like or damping-like component dominates exclusively -- the asymmetric spin torque features cooperative contributions from both components, leading to Néel vector dynamics that are fundamentally distinct from previous expectations. The switching conditions derived analytically agree well with simulation results and suggest various directions for further optimization. Our work establishes a general mechanism for current-induced Néel vector switching, which is in principle feasible for all collinear antiferromagnets, and thus paves the route to realize efficient writing in antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Title: Tunable corner states in topological insulators with long-range hoppings and diverse shapes
Authors: Fang Qin, Rui Chen
Abstract: In this work we develop a theoretical framework for the control of corner modes in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) featuring long-range hoppings and diverse geometries, enabling precise tunability of their spatial positions. First, we demonstrate that the locations of corner states can be finely tuned by varying long-range hoppings in a circular HOTI, as revealed by a detailed edge theory analysis and the condition of vanishing Dirac mass. Moreover, we show that long-range hoppings in different directions (e.g., $x$ and $y$) have distinct effects on the positioning of corner states. Second, we investigate HOTIs with various polygonal geometries and find that the presence and location of corner modes depend sensitively on the shape. In particular, a corner hosts a localized mode if the Dirac masses of its two adjacent edges have opposite signs, while no corner mode emerges if the masses share the same sign. Our findings offer a versatile approach for the controlled manipulation of corner modes in HOTIs, opening avenues for the design and implementation of higher-order topological materials.

Title: Symmetry analysis of cross-circular and parallel-circular Raman optical activity
Authors: Hikaru Watanabe, Rikuto Oiwa, Gakuto Kusuno, Takuya Satoh, Ryotaro Arita
Abstract: The Raman scattering regarding the circularly-polarized incident and scattered lights is closely related to the circular activity of a given system. We investigate the symmetry of its activity, called the cross-circular and parallel-circular Raman optical activity. The analysis is systematically performed with the magnetic point groups and indicates that the response allows for a useful diagnosis of the symmetry of materials like chirality and (magneto-)axiality. It is also shown that the Stokes and anti-Stokes processes are related to each other by the conserved antiunitary symmetry for the time-reversal operation and that combined with the mirror reflection.

Title: Dynamical stability for dense patterns in discrete attractor neural networks
Authors: Uri Cohen, Máté Lengyel
Abstract: Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By directly analyzing the bulk and outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.

Title: Numerically Discovered Inherent States are Always Protocol Dependent in Jammed Packings
Authors: Eddie Bautista, Eric I. Corwin
Abstract: The energy landscape for soft sphere packings exists in a high-dimensional space and plays host to an astronomical number of local minima in a hierarchical and ultrametric arrangement. Each point in the landscape is a configuration that can be unambiguously mapped to its inherent state, defined as the local minimum that the configuration will flow to under perfectly overdamped continuous dynamics. Typically, discrete in time dynamics are used to computationally find local minima, but it is not known whether these algorithms are capable of reliably finding inherent states. Here, we use steepest descent dynamics to find the distribution of the largest time step, $\delta_\textrm{best}$, which finds the inherent state. We find that for systems of $N$ particles, $\delta_\textrm{best}$ is approximately proportional to $N^{-3}$, and weakly dependent on d and $\varphi$. We argue that the proportionality is due to saddle points in the energy landscape. Our results suggest that it is impossible, in practice, to reliably find inherent states for systems of about 64 particles or more.

Title: Flow Matching at Scale: A Machine Learning Framework for Efficient Large-Size Sampling of Many-Body Systems
Authors: Qian-Rui Lee, Daw-Wei Wang
Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous, temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability offers a powerful and efficient alternative for studying critical phenomena. The method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems described by continuous fields on a lattice. Furthermore, this framework can serve as a powerful proposal generator in a hybrid scheme with MCMC, dramatically accelerating high-precision studies of the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Orbital-selective two-gap superconductivity in kagome metal CsV3Sb5
Authors: Run Lv, Wenqian Tu, Dingfu Shao, Yuping Sun, Wenjian Lu
Abstract: Recent experiments have revealed anisotropic multi-gap superconductivity in the kagome metal CsV3Sb5. However, the impact of multi-orbital character and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) on the multiple superconducting gaps remains not fully understood. In this work, we theoretically investigate the multi-orbital electronic structure and superconducting gap properties of CsV3Sb5 by combining first-principles calculations with superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT). Our results demonstrate that orbital-selective pairing drives the observed two-gap superconductivity in CsV3Sb5. Specifically, the two distinct gaps exhibit strong orbital dependence: a large, highly anisotropic gap (average magnitude ~0.64 meV) primarily originates from V-3d orbitals, while a small, isotropic gap (~0.25 meV) is associated with the Sb-5pz orbital. The V-3d orbitals exhibit strong coupling to the in-plane V-V bond-stretching and out-of-plane V-Sb bending phonon modes, whereas the Sb-5pz orbitals show weak coupling to the out-of-plane vibrations of both Cs and the apical Sb atoms. These findings provide fundamental insights into the orbital-selective superconductivity and EPC mechanisms in kagome CsV3Sb5.

Title: Learning Reaction-Diffusion Kinetics from Mechanical Information
Authors: Royal C. Ihuaenyi, Hongbo Zhao, Ruqing Fang, Ruobing Bai, Martin Z. Bazant, Juner Zhu
Abstract: A central challenge in materials science is characterizing chemical processes that are elusive to direct measurement, particularly in functional materials operating under realistic conditions. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical strain fields contain sufficient information to reconstruct hidden chemical kinetics in coupled chemomechanical systems. Our partial differential equation-constrained learning framework decodes concentration-dependent diffusion kinetics, thermodynamic driving forces, and spatially heterogeneous reaction rates solely from mechanical observations. Using battery electrode materials as a model system, we demonstrate that the framework can accurately identify complex constitutive laws governing three distinct scenarios: classical Fickian diffusion, spinodal decomposition with pattern formation, and heterogeneous electrochemical reactions with spatial rate variations. The approach demonstrates robustness while maintaining accuracy with limited spatial data and reasonable experimental noise levels. Most significantly, the framework simultaneously infers multiple fundamental processes and properties, including diffusivity, reaction kinetics, chemical potential, and spatial heterogeneity maps, all from mechanical information alone. This method establishes a paradigm for materials characterization, enabling accurate learning of chemical processes in energy storage systems, catalysts, and phase-change materials where conventional diagnostics prove difficult. By revealing that mechanical deformation patterns serve as information-rich fingerprints of the underlying chemical processes, this work follows the pathway of inversely learning constitutive laws, with broad implications in materials science and engineering.

Title: Origin of Glass-like Thermal Conductivity in Crystalline TlAgTe
Authors: Shantanu Semwal, Yi Xia, Chris Wolverton, Koushik Pal
Abstract: Ordered crystalline compounds exhibiting ultralow and glass-like thermal conductivity are both fundamentally and technologically important, where phonon quasi-particles dominate their heat transport. Understanding the microscopic mechanisms that govern such unusual transport behavior is necessary to unravel the complex interplay of crystal structure, phonons, and collective excitations of these quasi-particles. Here, we use state-of-the-art first-principles calculations based on quantum density functional theory to investigate the origin of experimentally measured unusually low and glassy thermal conductivity in semiconducting TlAgTe. Utilizing a unifying framework of anharmonic lattice dynamics theory that combine phonon self-energy induced frequency renormalization, particle-like Peierls ($\kappa_{l}^{P}$) and wave-like coherent ($\kappa_{l}^{C}$) thermal transport contributions including three and four-phonon scattering channels, we successfully explain the experimental results both in terms of magnitude and temperature dependence. Our analysis reveals that TlAgTe exhibits several localized phonon modes arising from concerted rattling-like vibration of Tl atoms, which show strong temperature dependence and enhanced four-phonon scattering rates that are dominated by Umklapp processes, suppressing $\kappa_{l}^{P}$ to ultralow values. The ensuing strong anharmonicity induced by local structural distortions, lone-pair electrons, and rattling-like vibrations of the heavy cations lead to a transition from particle-like behavior to wave-like tunneling characteristics of the phonon modes above 40 cm$^{-1}$, contributing significantly to $\kappa_{l}^{C}$ which increases with temperature. Our analysis uncovers important structure-property relationship, which may be used in designing of novel materials with tunable thermal conductivity.

Title: Percolation transition in entangled granular networks
Authors: Seongmin Kim, Daihui Wu, Yilong Han
Abstract: Highly nonconvex granular particles, such as staples and metal shavings, can form solid-like cohesive structures through geometric entanglement (interlocking). The network structure formed by this entanglement, however, remains largely unexplored. Here we utilize network science to investigate the entanglement networks of C-shaped granular particles under vibration through experiments and simulations. By analyzing key network properties, we demonstrate that these networks undergo a percolation transition as the number of links increases logarithmically over time; the entangled particles form a giant cluster when the number of links exceeds a critical threshold. We propose a continuum percolation model of rings that effectively describes the observed transition. Additionally, we find that particle's opening angle significantly affects mechanical bonding and, consequently, the network structure. This work highlights the potential of network-based approaches to study entangled materials, paving the way for advancements in applications ranging from mechanical metamaterials to entangled robot swarms.

Title: Odd-Parity Selection in Parity-Forbidden Electronic Transitions Revealed by Mn4+ Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Authors: Yitong Wang, Fei Tang, Jiqiang Ning, Shijie Xu
Abstract: Mn4+-doped fluoride phosphors represent a significant class of narrow band red-emitting materials, whose luminescent properties are profoundly influenced by electron-phonon coupling. However, the parity-forbidden nature of these electronic transition systems is incompatible with the conventional Condon approximation, which is widely adopted in the classic theories such as the Huang-Rhys theory, a framework established on the assumption of parity-allowed electric dipole transitions. This results in a critical knowledge gap regarding the principles governing the phonon sidebands of parity-forbidden electronic transitions. This study experimentally reveals a pronounced parity-dependent intensity distribution in the phonon sidebands of these systems: significantly suppressed even-order sidebands and normally observed odd-order sidebands. To elucidate the phenomenon, we extend the Huang-Rhys theory to parity-forbidden systems by incorporating the Herzberg-Teller approximation into the treatment of the transition matrix elements. The improved theory successfully uncovers the physical mechanism behind the strong suppression of the even-order sidebands in the parity-forbidden systems, in which the Huang-Rhys factor is derived as S=((2I_3)/(9I_1 ))^(1/2). This work not only reveals new findings regarding the phonon sidebands of the parity-forbidden electronic transition systems, but also establishes an improved theoretical framework for understanding the electron-phonon coupling mechanisms of color centers in solids.

Title: Intermittent localization and fast spatial learning by non-Markov random walks with decaying memory
Authors: Paulina R. Martín-Cornejo, Denis Boyer
Abstract: Random walks on lattices with preferential relocation to previously visited sites provide a simple modeling of the displacements of animals and humans. When the lattice contains a single impurity or resource site where the walker spends more time on average at each visit than on the other sites, the long range memory can suppress diffusion and induce by reinforcement a steady state localized around the resource. This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial learning process by the walker. Here we study theoretically and numerically how the decay of memory impacts learning in these models. If memory decays as $1/\tau$ or slower, where $\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the localized solutions are the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and they are linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\tau$, for instance exponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where well localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are interspersed with intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes, for a kernel in $1/\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the fastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence forgetting can allow the walker to save memory without compromising learning and to achieve a faster learning. These findings agree with biological evidence on the benefits of forgetting.

Title: Non-Ferroelectric to Ferroelectric Phase Transition in epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ via Rapid Thermal Annealing Induced Nitrogen Doping
Authors: Soumyajyoti Mondal, Asraful Haque, Binoy Krishna De, Shubham Kumar Parate, Pramod Kumar Yadav, Arup Basak, Kaushal Tiwari, Bhagwati Prasad, Pavan Nukala
Abstract: Oxygen vacancies are often essential for stabilizing the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase in HfO$_2$, with cationic doping widely employed to introduce such defects. In contrast, systematic studies on anionic doping to induce ferroelectricity remain largely in nascent stages. On epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ grown on ITO buffered YSZ substrates that crystallize in a mixed monoclinic (non-polar) and orthorhombic (polar) phases, we introduce nitrogen doping via post deposition rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in N$_2$ atmosphere at 900~$^\circ$C. As the annealing time increases from 10s to 4min, the monoclinic phase fraction diminishes, enabling the emergence of well-defined ferroelectric loops in films annealed beyond 2~min. We clearly show that this is an effect of nitrogen incorporation (doping) into the samples through a suite of structure-property correlation measurements including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These results reveal that nitrogen actively participates in the RTA-induced phase stabilization, enabling ferroelectricity in epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ without sacrificing crystallographic coherence, providing a viable pathway for structure-property correlation studies and a model system to study opto-electronic devices integrated with ferroelectrics.

Title: Enhanced Terahertz Thermoelectricity via Engineered van Hove Singularities and Nernst Effect in Moiré Superlattices
Authors: L. Elesin, A. L. Shilov, S. Jana, I. Mazurenko, P. A. Pantaleon, M. Kashchenko, N. Krivovichev, V. Dremov, I. Gayduchenko, G. Goltsman, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, Y. Wang, E. I. Titova, D. A. Svintsov, K. S. Novoselov, D. A. Bandurin
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials, long explored for energy harvesting and thermal sensing, convert heat directly into electrical signals. Extending their application to the terahertz (THz) frequency range opens opportunities for low-noise, bias-free THz detection, yet conventional thermoelectrics lack the sensitivity required for practical devices. Thermoelectric coefficients can be strongly enhanced near van Hove singularities (VHS), though these are usually difficult to access in conventional materials. Here we show that moiré band engineering unlocks these singularities for THz optoelectronics. Using 2D moiré structures as a model system, we observe strong enhancement of the THz photothermoelectric response in monolayer and bilayer graphene superlattices when the Fermi level is tuned to band singularities. Applying a relatively small magnetic field further boosts the response through the THz-driven Nernst effect, a transverse thermoelectric current driven by the THz-induced temperature gradient. Our results establish moiré superlattices as a versatile platform for THz thermoelectricity and highlight engineered band structures as a route to high-performance THz optoelectronic devices.

Title: Deep Variational Multivariate Information Bottleneck -- A Framework for Variational Losses
Authors: Eslam Abdelaleem, Ilya Nemenman, K. Michael Martini
Abstract: Variational dimensionality reduction methods are widely used for their accuracy, generative capabilities, and robustness. We introduce a unifying framework that generalizes both such as traditional and state-of-the-art methods. The framework is based on an interpretation of the multivariate information bottleneck, trading off the information preserved in an encoder graph (defining what to compress) against that in a decoder graph (defining a generative model for data). Using this approach, we rederive existing methods, including the deep variational information bottleneck, variational autoencoders, and deep multiview information bottleneck. We naturally extend the deep variational CCA (DVCCA) family to beta-DVCCA and introduce a new method, the deep variational symmetric information bottleneck (DVSIB). DSIB, the deterministic limit of DVSIB, connects to modern contrastive learning approaches such as Barlow Twins, among others. We evaluate these methods on Noisy MNIST and Noisy CIFAR-100, showing that algorithms better matched to the structure of the problem like DVSIB and beta-DVCCA produce better latent spaces as measured by classification accuracy, dimensionality of the latent variables, sample efficiency, and consistently outperform other approaches under comparable conditions. Additionally, we benchmark against state-of-the-art models, achieving superior or competitive accuracy. Our results demonstrate that this framework can seamlessly incorporate diverse multi-view representation learning algorithms, providing a foundation for designing novel, problem-specific loss functions.

Title: Propp's benzels and Lai's nearly symmetric hexagons with holes
Authors: Seok Hyun Byun, Mihai Ciucu, Yi-Lin Lee
Abstract: In this paper we present a new version of the second author's factorization theorem for perfect matchings of symmetric graphs. We then use our result to solve four open problems of Propp on the enumeration of trimer tilings on the hexagonal lattice. As another application, we obtain a semi-factorization result for the number of lozenge tilings of a large class of hexagonal regions with holes (obtained by starting with an arbitrary symmetric hexagon with holes, and translating all the holes one unit lattice segment in the same direction). This in turn leads to the solution of two open problems posed by Lai and to an extension of a result due to Fulmek and Krattenthaler, which results in exact enumeration formulas for some new families of hexagonal regions with holes. Our result also allows us to find new, simpler proofs (and in one case, a new, simpler form) of some formulas due to Krattenthaler for the number of perfect matchings of Aztec rectangles with unit holes along a lattice diagonal.

Title: Transdimensional Defects
Authors: Elia de Sabbata, Nadav Drukker, Andreas Stergiou
Abstract: This note introduces a novel paradigm for conformal defects with continuously adjustable dimensions. Just as the standard $\varepsilon$ expansion interpolates between integer spacetime dimensions, a new parameter, $\delta$, is used to interpolate between different integer-dimensional defects. The ensuing framework is explored in detail for defects of dimension $p=2+\delta$ in both free and interacting $O(N)$ bulk conformal field theories (CFTs) in $d=4-\varepsilon$. Comprehensive calculations are performed to first and second order in $\varepsilon$ and to high or all orders in $\delta$. Additionally, in the large-$N$ limit, the interpolation between defects of dimensions $p=1$ and $p=2$ is analysed for spacetime dimensions $4\leq d\leq 6$. The new parameter $\delta$ provides a natural enrichment of the space of defect CFTs and allows to find new integer dimension or co-dimension defects.

Title: Periodic revivals from supersymmetry in a fermionic kinetically constrained model
Authors: Wouter Buijsman, Pieter W. Claeys
Abstract: Supersymmetry provides a natural playground for the construction of dynamically constrained lattice fermion models. We here illustrate how supersymmetry can be used to construct a fermionic equivalent of the PXP model with an adjustable chemical potential. This model is closely related to the $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric $M_1$ model, inheriting its integrability. The supersymmetric algebra additionally implies that the dynamics exhibit periodic revivals for specific initial states, including the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered (every second site occupied) product state. These dynamics are reminiscent to those of the PXP model, a paradigmatic effective model in the field of quantum many-body scars. We draw a further parallel by uncovering eigenstates obeying sub-thermal entanglement scaling at energies given by (plus or minus) square roots of integers and relate these to special eigenstates of the $M_1$ model. While we focus on a concrete model, our proposed approach is applicable to more general supersymmetric algebras, where it is expected to lead to non-ergodic dynamics.

Title: Chiral vortical conductivities and the moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas
Authors: M. Abedlou Ahadi, N. Sadooghi
Abstract: We determine the chiral vortical conductivities, as well as the orbital and spin moment of inertia of a charged, chiral, and rigidly rotating free Fermi gas. To this purpose, we begin by calculating the vacuum expectation values of a vector and axial vector current using the free fermion propagator in this medium. This propagator is derived by employing the Fock-Schwinger method based on the solutions of the Dirac equation in the presence of rotation and finite axial chemical potential. We present a complete derivation of these solutions. We demonstrate that in the first approximation, the chiral vortical conductivity associated with the vector current is proportional to the product of the vector and axial chemical potentials. In contrast, the chiral vortical conductivity related to the axial vector current depends on the temperature, the vector, and the axial vector chemical potential squares. We use the relation between the axial vector current and the angular momentum density associated with spin to determine the spin and the orbital moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas in a charged and chirally imbalanced medium separately. In addition, we compute the total moment of inertia by utilizing the methods presented in the first part of the paper and show that the orbital moment of inertia of a free fermion gas vanishes.

Title: Dynamical Decoupling of Generalization and Overfitting in Large Two-Layer Networks
Authors: Andrea Montanari, Pierfrancesco Urbani
Abstract: Understanding the inductive bias and generalization properties of large overparametrized machine learning models requires to characterize the dynamics of the training algorithm. We study the learning dynamics of large two-layer neural networks via dynamical mean field theory, a well established technique of non-equilibrium statistical physics. We show that, for large network width, the training dynamics exhibits a separation of timescales which implies: $(i)$ The emergence of a slow time scale associated with the growth in Gaussian/Rademacher complexity of the network; $(ii)$ Inductive bias towards small complexity if the initialization has small enough complexity; $(iii)$ A dynamical decoupling between feature learning and overfitting regimes; $(iv)$ A non-monotone behavior of the test error, associated `feature unlearning' regime at large times.

Title: Direct comparison of stochastic driven nonlinear dynamical systems for combinatorial optimization
Authors: Junpeng Hou, Amin Barzegar, Helmut G. Katzgraber
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in industrial applications. However, finding optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can often be extremely hard. Because some of these problems can be mapped to the ground-state search of the Ising model, tremendous effort has been devoted to developing solvers for Ising-type problems over the past decades. Recent advances in controlling and manipulating both quantum and classical systems have enabled novel computing paradigms such as quantum simulators and coherent Ising machines to tackle hard optimization problems. Here, we examine and benchmark several physics-inspired optimization algorithms, including coherent Ising machines, gain-dissipative algorithms, simulated bifurcation machines, and Hopfield neural networks, which we collectively refer to as stochastic-driven nonlinear dynamical systems. Most importantly, we benchmark these algorithms against random Ising problems with planted solutions and compare them to simulated annealing as a baseline leveraging the same software stack for all solvers. We further study how different numerical integration techniques and graph connectivity affect performance. This work provides an overview of a diverse set of new optimization paradigms.

Title: Controlling Competing Feedback Mechanisms for Programmable Patterns via Nonlinear Laser Lithography
Authors: Özgün Yavuz, Ihor Pavlov, Abdullah bin Aamir, Sezin Galioğlu, Petro Deminskyi, Ü. Seleme Nizam Bayrak, Onur Tokel, Serim Ilday, F. Ömer Ilday
Abstract: Controlling laser-induced pattern formation remains a long-standing challenge. A key advance was recognising the pivotal role of intrinsic feedback mechanisms in self-organisation, which enabled self-similar patterns with long-range order through nonlinear laser lithography. This concept was recently leveraged to surpass the diffraction limit. However, demonstrated structures in laser-induced pattern formation have been relatively simple and material-specific, as they rely on a single assumed formation mechanism for each material. Here, we reveal the coexistence of competing feedback mechanisms that drive distinct chemical and ablative processes, resulting in patterns with different symmetries. We show that one mechanism can be selectively activated, while completely suppressing the other, by tuning the laser parameters independently of the material. The competing mechanisms break surface symmetries in distinct lateral and vertical directions, and the selection can be dynamically inverted in situ, leading to rich surface chemistries and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications through the maskless and ambient-air fabrication of complex composite patterns on diverse materials and substrates. These include seamlessly stitched superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic domains, structural colour, and a holographic temperature sensor. Combining programmable mechanism selection with recent demonstrations of sub-10 nm features could enable the maskless fabrication of composite structures that rival the capabilities of nanofabrication techniques.

Title: From Chaos to Coherence: Effects of High-Order Synaptic Correlations on Neural Dynamics
Authors: Nimrod Sherf, Xaq Pitkow, Krešimir Josić, Kevin E. Bassler
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Network models have elucidated the interplay between structure and dynamics in biological neural networks, particularly the emergence of irregular and rhythmic activities in cortex. However, most studies have focused on networks with random or simple connectivity structures. Experimental observations find that high-order cortical connectivity patterns affect the temporal patterns of network activity, but a theory that relates such complex structure to network dynamics has yet to be developed. Here, we show that third- and higher-order cyclic correlations in synaptic connectivities greatly impact neuronal dynamics. Specifically, strong cyclic correlations in a network suppress chaotic dynamics and promote oscillatory or fixed activity. This change in dynamics is related to the form of the unstable eigenvalues of the random connectivity matrix. A phase transition from chaotic to fixed or oscillatory activity coincides with the development of a cusp at the leading edge of the eigenvalue support. We also relate the dimensions of activity to the network structure.

Title: The Enduring Relevance of Semiempirical Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Jonathan E. Moussa
Abstract: The development of semiempirical models to simplify quantum mechanical descriptions of atomistic systems is a practice that started soon after the discovery of quantum mechanics and continues to the present day. There are now many methods for atomistic simulation with many software implementations and many users, on a scale large enough to be considered as a software market. Semiempirical models occupied a large share of this market in its early days, but the research activity in atomistic simulation has steadily polarized over the last three decades towards general-purpose but expensive ab initio quantum mechanics methods and fast but special-purpose molecular mechanics methods. I offer perspective on recent trends in atomistic simulation from the middle ground of semiempirical modeling, to learn from its past success and consider its possible paths to future growth. In particular, there is a lot of ongoing research activity in combining semiempirical quantum mechanics with machine learning models and some unrealized possibilities of tighter integration between ab initio and semiempirical quantum mechanics with more flexible theoretical frameworks and more modular software components.

Title: Slip-flow theory for thermo-osmosis based on a kinetic model with near-wall potential
Authors: Tetsuro Tsuji, Koichiro Takita, Satoshi Taguchi
Abstract: In this paper, thermal-slip coefficients in slip boundary conditions of the Stokes equation are derived using the generalized slip-flow theory, with special interest in the role of near-wall potential in micro- and nanoscale flows. As the model of fluids and fluid-solid interaction, we employ the model Boltzmann equation for dilute gases and the diffuse-reflection boundaries with near-wall potential, respectively. It is found that, when the mean free path of gas molecules and the effective range of potential are of the same order of magnitude, the thermal-slip boundary condition can be derived in the near-continuum limit. In the derived slip-flow theory, the thermal-slip coefficient and the boundary-layer corrections (i.e., Knudsen-layer corrections) are determined by solving the kinetic boundary-layer problems (i.e., Knudsen-layer problems) that include external-force terms and inhomogeneous terms both driven by the potential. As an application of the slip-flow theory, thermo-osmosis between two parallel plates with uniform temperature gradients is analyzed. The results of the slip-flow theory are validated by comparing them with those of the direct numerical analysis of the same problem. Furthermore, it is found that thermo-osmosis and thermal slip on the plates are significantly affected by the features of the near-wall potential; even the gas-flow direction can be reversed when the near-wall potential is repulsive. Such a flow reversal is qualitatively similar to thermo-osmosis in liquids reported in existing molecular dynamics simulation.

Title: Variational simulation of quantum phase transitions induced by boundary fields
Authors: Alan Duriez, Andreia Saguia, Marcelo S. Sarandy
Abstract: The characterization of quantum phase transitions is a fundamental task for the understanding of quantum phases of matter, with a number of potential applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we use digital quantum simulation as a resource to theoretically and experimentally study quantum phase transitions. More specifically, we implement the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ transverse-field Ising chain in the presence of boundary magnetic fields. Such fields can induce a rich phase diagram, including a first-order line and also a continuous wetting transition, which is a quantum version of the classical wetting surface phenomenon. We present results for noiseless simulations of the associated quantum circuits as well as hardware results taken from a superconducting quantum processor. For different regions of the phase diagram, the quantum algorithm allows us to predict the critical value of the magnetic fields responsible for either the first or second-order transitions occurring in the system.

Title: RinQ: Towards predicting central sites in proteins on current quantum computers
Authors: Shah Ishmam Mohtashim
Abstract: We introduce RinQ, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for identifying functionally critical residues in proteins by formulating centrality detection as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. Protein structures are modeled as residue interaction networks (RINs), and the QUBO formulations are solved using D-Wave's simulated annealing. Applied to a diverse set of proteins, RinQ consistently identifies central residues that closely align with classical benchmarks, demonstrating both the accuracy and robustness of the approach.

Title: Continuous-wave, high-resolution, ultra-broadband mid-infrared nonlinear spectroscopy with tunable plasmonic nanocavities
Authors: Zhiyuan Xie, Nobuaki Oyamada, Francesco Ciccarello, Wen Chen, Christophe Galland
Abstract: Vibrational sum- and difference-frequency generation (SFG and DFG) spectroscopy is a technique to probe the nonlinear response of interfaces at mid-infrared wavelengths while detecting the upconverted signal at visible wavelengths. It has recently transitioned from large-area molecular films and colloidal suspensions to nanoscale structures, enabled by dual-resonant plasmonic nanocavities that confine light and matter in the same deep-subwavelength sensing volume. Here, we implement high-resolution ($<1$~cm$^{-1}$), continuous-wave ultra-broadband SFG and DFG spectroscopy from $860$ to $1670~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ on a variety of dual-resonant antennas under ambient conditions. The use of a commercial, broadly tunable quantum-cascade laser and the absence of geometric phase-matching requirements speed up and simplify data acquisition. At the same time, simultaneous access to SFG and DFG sidebands permits ratiometric signal analysis, enabling both common-noise rejection and field-normalized characterization of coherent response. The resulting spectra harbour the signatures of coherent interference between the resonant (vibrational) and nonresonant (electronic) contributions to the $\chi^{(2)}$ susceptibility, previously only observed under fs- and ps-pulsed excitation. We demonstrate the versatility and reproducibility of our approach across several molecules that yield distinct resonant and nonresonant mid-infrared responses. Moreover, we identify robust differences between our data and DFT calculations that hint at the modification of the infrared molecular response by the nanocavity environment. Together, these features position our platform as a scalable route toward multiplexed, high-resolution mid-IR sensing and a potential basis for coherent single- or few-molecule vibrational spectroscopy at the chip level.

Title: Nonadiabatic force matching for alchemical free-energy estimation
Authors: Jorge L. Rosa-Raíces, David T. Limmer
Abstract: We propose a method to compute free-energy differences from nonadiabatic alchemical transformations using flow-based generative models. The method, nonadiabatic force matching, hinges on estimating the dissipation along an alchemical switching process in terms of a nonadiabatic force field that can be learned through stochastic flow matching. The learned field can be used in conjunction with short-time trajectory data to evaluate upper and lower bounds on the alchemical free energy that variationally converge to the exact value if the field is optimal. Applying the method to evaluate the alchemical free energy of atomistic models shows that it can substantially reduce the simulation cost of a free-energy estimate at negligible loss of accuracy when compared with thermodynamic integration.

Title: Heterogeneity drives plasmid maintenance in large microbial communities
Authors: Johannes Nauta, Kaitlin A. Schaal, Ying-Jie Wang, James P.J. Hall, Shai Pilosof, Manlio De Domenico
Abstract: Microbiomes are complex systems comprised of many interacting species. Species can survive harsh or changing conditions by rapid adaptation, a process accelerated by the exchange of genetic material between different species through horizontal gene transfer. Conjugative plasmids are ubiquitous mobile genetic elements that mediate such exchanges both within and between species. Therefore, predicting whether a plasmid can invade and be maintained by a microbial community is critical, for example when assessing the risks of antimicrobial resistance gene spread in commensal or environmental microbiomes. However, existing theory developed to assist such predictions has generally focused on the balance among plasmid costs, benefits, and infection rates, overlooking other relevant factors such as the inherent dynamics and diversity of microbiomes. Here, we hypothesize that plasmid persistence in the absence of positive selection can arise purely from the heterogeneity present in large and diverse microbial communities. We introduce a generic model that integrates population-level dynamics with plasmid conjugation. Using this model, we show that we can predict plasmid maintenance, and that the probability for a plasmid to be maintained depends on traits of the plasmid, most importantly the conjugation rate, and the species abundance distribution of the community. Then, using both empirical abundance data and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the inherent randomness of ecological interactions and conjugation rates enables plasmid persistence -- even in the absence of positive selection. Our findings thus suggest that natural microbial communities are likely to maintain plasmids indefinitely, offering a new perspective on the spread, maintenance, and ubiquity of plasmids.

Title: Approaching transform-limited linewidths in telecom-wavelength transitions of ungated quantum dots
Authors: Andrew N. Wakileh, Dan Dalacu, Philip J. Poole, Boris Lamontagne, Simona Moisa, Robin L. Williams, Nir Rotenberg
Abstract: Highly coherent quantum emitters operating in the telecommunication C-band (1530 - 1565nm), where ultra-low-loss fibers and photonic circuits are available, are crucial to the development of scalable quantum technologies. In this work, we report on a modified Stranski-Krastanov growth scheme using chemical beam epitaxy to enable the generation of high-quality InAs/InP quantum dots, characterized by near-transform-limited linewidths ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{TL}}$). We demonstrate the growth of highly-symmetric quantum dots with aspect ratios >0.8 and densities ranging from 2 to 22$\,\mu$m$^{-2}$. Optical characterization of these sources reveal fine-structure splittings down to $25\pm4\,\mu$eV and a single-photon purity of $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.012\pm\mathrm{0.007}$, confirming the quality of these dots. Further, using an etalon to measure the linewidth, in combination with rigorous modelling, we find an upper-bound to the mean, low-power linewidths of only $12.1\pm 6.7\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$ and, in the best case, $2.8\pm 1.8\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$. These results represent a significant step in the development of telecom-wavelength quantum light sources which are essential for complex quantum networks and devices.
