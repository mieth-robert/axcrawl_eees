Title: Interacting Chern insulator transition on the sphere: revealing the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa criticality
Authors: Zhi-Qiang Gao, Taige Wang, Dung-Hai Lee
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, the transition between topological and trivial Chern insulators exemplifies a class of beyond-Landau critical phenomena. We show that the interaction-driven multicritical point of this transition falls into the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) universality class, a topic of considerable interest in both high-energy and condensed matter physics. In this work, we focus on the $N=2$ case of the GNY criticality. We employ exact diagonalization of Dirac fermions on a sphere to circumvent the parity anomaly, capitalize on full SO(3) symmetry to reduce finite-size effects, and directly extract operator scaling dimensions from the excitation spectrum. Despite working with only modest system sizes, our results closely match conformal bootstrap predictions for low scaling dimension operators and reveal several previously uncharacterized higher primaries. These findings highlight the efficacy of spherical geometry for probing interacting Dirac criticality.

Title: Multimagnon and multispinon $L_3$-edge RIXS spectra of an effective $\tilde{J}_1-\tilde{J}_2-\tilde{J}_3$ square lattice Heisenberg model
Authors: Kai-Yuan Qi, Shangjian Jin, Trinanjan Datta, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: We investigate the multimagnon and the multispinon $L_3$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra of a spin-1/2 effective $\tilde{J}_1-\tilde{J}_2-\tilde{J}_3$ square lattice Heisenberg model in its Néel ordered phase. Motivated by the observation of satellite intensity peaks above the single magnon dispersion in the $L$-edge RIXS spectrum, we propose a resonating valence bond (RVB) inspired RIXS mechanism that incorporates the local site ultrashort core-hole lifetime (UCL) expansion. We compute the multimagnon and the multispinon excitations using $\mathcal{O}(1/S)$ interacting spin wave theory and Schwinger boson mean-field theory (SBMFT) formalism, respectively. We treat the x-ray scattering process up to second order in the UCL expansion. Our calculations of two-magnon, bimagnon, and three-magnon RIXS intensities reveal that interacting spin wave theory fails to fully capture all the quantum correlations in the antiferromagnetic ordered phase. However utilizing the SBMFT framework, with a ground state that combines Néel order and fluctuating RVB components, we demonstrate that a RIXS bond-flipping mechanism provides an alternative deeper physical explanation of the satellite intensities. Specifically, we find that the spin correlation spectra predicted by the fluctuating RVB mechanism aligns with higher order UCL expansion results. We further show that the satellite intensity above the single-magnon mode can originate both from a one-to-three-magnon hybridization vertex process and from condensed spinons exhibiting Higgs mechanism. These features reflect the interplay of quantum fluctuation, entanglement, and gauge interaction effects of quantum magnetism probed by RIXS.

Title: Bacterial chemotaxis considering memory effects (letter)
Authors: Manuel Mayo, Rodrigo Soto
Abstract: Chemotaxis in bacteria such as \textit{E.\ coli} is controlled by the slow methylation of chemoreceptors. As a consequence, intrinsic time and length scales of tens of seconds and hundreds of micrometers emerge, making the Keller--Segel equations invalid when the chemical signal changes on these scales, as occurs in several natural environments. Using a kinetic approach, we show that chemotaxis is described using the concentration field of the protein that controls tumbling in addition to bacterial density. The macroscopic equations for these fields are derived, which describe the nonlocal response.

Title: Bacterial chemotaxis considering memory effects
Authors: Manuel Mayo, Rodrigo Soto
Abstract: Bacterial chemotaxis for this http URL is controlled by methylation of chemoreceptors, which in a biochemical pathway regulates the concentration of the CheY-P protein that finally controls the tumbling rate. As a consequence, the tumbling rate adjusts to changes in the concentration of relevant chemicals, to produce a biased random walk toward chemoattractants of against the repellers. Methylation is a slow process, implying that the internal concentration of CheY-P is not instantaneously adapted to the environment, and the tumbling rate presents memory. This implies that the Keller-Segel (KS) equations used to describe chemotaxis at the macroscopic scale, which assume a local relation between the bacterial flux and the chemical gradient, are not fully valid as memory and the associated nonlocal response are not considered. To derive the equations that replace the KS ones, we use a kinetic approach, in which a kinetic equation for the bacterial transport is written considering the dynamics of the protein concentration. When memory is large, the protein concentration field must be considered a relevant variable as the bacterial density. Working out the Chapman-Enskog (CE) method, the dynamical equations for these fields are obtained, which have the form of reaction-diffusion equations with flux and source terms depending on the gradients on the chemical signal. The transport coefficients are obtained entirely in terms of the microscopic dynamics, giving their values of the case of this http URL. Solving the equations for an inhomogeneous signal it is shown that the response is nonlocal, with a smoothing length as large as $170\mu$m for this http URL. The homogeneous response and the relaxational dynamics are also studied. The case of small memory is also studied, in which case the CE method reproduces the KS equations, with explicit expressions for the transport coefficients.

Title: Helicons in multi-Weyl semimetals
Authors: Shiv Kumar Ram, Amit Gupta
Abstract: Helicons are transverse electromagnetic modes in three dimension(3D) electron systems in the presence of a static magnetic field. This modes have been proposed in isotropic or single Weyl semimetals(sWSMs) (Francesco M.D. Pellegrino et al, Phys. Rev. B 92, 201407(R) (2015)). In this work, we extend our study to investigate helicons modes in gapless multi-Weyl semimetals(mWSMs) within semiclassical Boltzmann approach and discuss the differences that arise compared to single Weyl semimetals.

Title: Strain engineering of doped hydrogen passivated silicon quantum dots
Authors: Swarnava Ghosh, Markus Eisenbach
Abstract: Silicon quantum dots are nanomaterials that are attractive candidates for photovoltaic applications. Doping of these materials creates p-n junctions and is important for solar cells. In this work, we present a first-principles study of the coupled influence of doping and strain on the stability, energy gap, Fermi level, electronic density, and density of states of hydrogen-passivated silicon quantum dots. We find that the cohesive energy and the energy gap decrease with increasing quantum dot size and are strongly influenced by strain. Furthermore, the response to strain also depends on the size of the quantum dot and dopant type. We present expressions of cohesive energy and energy gap as power-law of size and polynomial dependence on strain. We also show that the Fermi energy increases with size for pristine and p-type doping but decreases with size for n-type doping. We also discuss the influence of strain and dopant type on the density of states and electron density of the quantum dots.

Title: Electronic dimensionality of UTe2
Authors: L. Zhang, C. Guo, D. Graf, C. Putzke, M. M. Bordelon, E. D. Bauer, S. M. Thomas, F. Ronning, P. F. S. Rosa, P. J. W. Moll
Abstract: Superconductivity in the heavy-fermion metal UTe2 survives the application of very high magnetic fields, presenting both an intriguing puzzle and an experimental challenge. The strong, non-perturbative influence of the magnetic field complicates the determination of superconducting order parameters in the high-field phases. Here, we report electronic transport anisotropy measurements in precisely aligned microbars in magnetic fields to 45 T applied along the b-axis. Our results reveal a highly directional vortex pinning force in the field-reinforced phase. The critical current is significantly suppressed for currents along the c direction, whereas the flux-flow voltage is reduced with slight angular misalignments--hallmarks of vortex lock-in transitions typically seen in quasi-2D superconductors like cuprates and pnictides. These findings challenge the assumption of nearly isotropic charge transport in UTe2 and point to enhanced two-dimensionality in the high-field state, consistent with a change in the order parameter. A pair-density-wave-like state at high fields could naturally induce a layered modulation of the superfluid density, forming planar structures that confine vortices and guide their sliding in the flux-flow regime.

Title: Nernst power factor and figure of merit in compensated semimetal ScSb
Authors: Antu Laha, Sarah Paone, Asish K. Kundu, Juntao Yao, Niraj Aryal, Elio Vescovo, Qiang Li
Abstract: Recently, topological semimetals have emerged as strong candidates for solid state thermomagnetic refrigerators due to their enhanced Nernst effect. This enhancement arises from the combined contributions of the Berry curvature induced anomalous Nernst coefficient associated with topological bands and the normal Nernst effect resulting from synergistic electron-hole compensation. Generally, these two effects are intertwined in topological semimetals, making it challenging to evaluate them independently. Here, we report the observation of high Nernst effect in the electron hole compensated semimetal ScSb with topologically trivial electronic band structures. Remarkably, we find a high maximum Nernst power factor of $PF_N \sim 35 \times 10^{-4}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ in ScSb. The Nernst thermopower ($S_{xy}$) exhibits a peak of $\sim$ 47 $\mu$V/K at 12 K and 14 T, yielding a Nernst figure of merit ($z_N$) of $\sim 28 \times 10^{-4}$ K$^{-1}$. Notably, despite its trivial electronic band structure, both the $PF_N$ and $z_N$ values of ScSb are comparable to those observed in topological semimetals with Dirac band dispersions. The origin of the large Nernst signal in ScSb is explained by well compensated electron and hole carriers, through Hall resistivity measurements, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Title: The case of the missing gallium vacancy in gallium arsenide: A multiscale explanation
Authors: Leopoldo Diaz, Harold P. Hjalmarson, Jesse J. Lutz, Peter A. Schultz
Abstract: Irradiation of gallium arsenide (GaAs) produces immobile vacancies and mobile interstitials. However, after decades of experimental investigation, the immobile Ga vacancy eludes observation, raising the question: Where is the Ga vacancy? Static first-principles calculations predict a Ga vacancy should be readily observed. We find that short-time dynamical evolution of primary defects is key to explaining this conundrum. Introducing a multiscale Atomistically Informed Device Engineering (AIDE) method, we discover that during the initial displacement damage, the Fermi level shifts to mid-gap producing oppositely charged vacancies and interstitials. Driven by Coulomb attraction, fast As interstitials preferentially annihilate Ga vacancies, causing their population to plummet below detectable limits before being experimentally observed. This innovative model solves the mystery of the missing Ga vacancy and reveals the importance of a multiscale approach to explore the dynamical chemical behavior in experimentally inaccessible short-time regimes.

Title: Nonreciprocal wave-mediated interactions power a classical time crystal
Authors: Mia C. Morrell, Leela Elliott, David G. Grier
Abstract: An acoustic standing wave acts as a lattice of evenly spaced potential energy wells for sub-wavelength-scale objects. Trapped particles interact with each other by exchanging waves that they scatter from the standing wave. Unless the particles have identical scattering properties, their wave-mediated interactions are nonreciprocal. Pairs of particles can use this nonreciprocity to harvest energy from the wave to sustain steady-state oscillations despite viscous drag and the absence of periodic driving. We show in theory and experiment that a minimal system composed of two acoustically levitated particles can access five distinct dynamical states, two of which are emergently active steady states. Under some circumstances, these emergently active steady states break spatiotemporal symmetry and therefore constitute a classical time crystal.

Title: Orientation-Adaptive Virtual Imaging of Defects using EBSD

Abstract: EBSD is a foundational technique for characterizing crystallographic orientation, phase distribution, and lattice strain. Embedded within EBSD patterns lies latent information on dislocation structures, subtly encoded due to their deviation from perfect crystallinity - a feature often underutilized. Here, a novel framework termed orientation-adaptive virtual apertures (OAVA) is introduced. OAVAs enable the generation of virtual images tied to specific diffraction conditions, allowing the direct visualization of individual dislocations from a single EBSD map. By dynamically aligning virtual apertures in reciprocal space with the local crystallographic orientation, the method enhances contrast from defect-related strain fields, mirroring the principles of diffraction-contrast imaging in TEM, but without sample tilting. The approach capitalizes on the extensive diffraction space captured in a single high-quality EBSD scan, with its effectiveness enhanced by modern direct electron detectors that offer high-sensitivity at low accelerating voltages, reducing interaction volume and improving spatial resolution. We demonstrate that using OAVAs, identical imaging conditions can be applied across a polycrystalline field-of-view, enabling uniform contrast in differently oriented grains. Furthermore, in single-crystal GaN, threading dislocations are consistently resolved. Algorithms for the automated detection of dislocation contrast are presented, advancing defect characterization. By using OAVAs across a wide range of diffraction conditions in GaN, the visibility/invisibility of defects, owing to the anisotropy of the elastic strain field, is assessed and linked to candidate Burgers vectors. Altogether, OAVA offers a new and high-throughput pathway for orientation-specific defect characterization with the potential for automated, large-area defect analysis in single and polycrystalline materials.

Title: Transition from positive to negative photoconductivity in AlGaN/GaN quantum-well heterostructures
Authors: Maciej Matys, Atsushi Yamada, Toshihiro Ohki, Kouji Tsunoda
Abstract: The AlGaN/GaN quantum-well heterostructures typically exhibit a positive photoconductivity (PPC) during the light illumination. Surprisingly, we found that introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier into N-polar AlGaN/GaN quantum-well heterostructures induces a transition in these heterostructures from PPC to negativie photoconductivity (NPC) as the SL period number increased at room temperature. This transition occurred under an infrared light illumination and can be well explained in terms of the excitation of hot electrons from the two-dimensional electron gas and subsequent trapping them in a SL structure. The NPC effect observed in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with SL back barrier exhibits photoconductivity yield exceeding 85 % and thus is the largest ones reported so far for semiconductors. In addition, NPC signal remains relatively stable at high temperatures up to 400 K. The obtained results can be interesting for the development of NPC related devices such as photoelectric logic gates, photoelectronic memory and infrared photodetectors.

Title: Evidence of Ultrashort Orbital Transport in Heavy Metals Revealed by Terahertz Emission Spectroscopy
Authors: Tongyang Guan, Jiahao Liu, Wentao Qin, Yongwei Cui, Shunjia Wang, Yizheng Wu, Zhensheng Tao
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum of electrons offers a promising, yet largely unexplored, degree of freedom for ultrafast, energy-efficient information processing. As the foundation of orbitronics, understanding how orbital currents propagate and convert into charge currents is essential - but remains elusive due to the challenge in disentangling orbital and spin dynamics in ultrathin films. Although orbital currents have been predicted to propagate over long distances in materials, recent theoretical studies argue that lattice symmetry may constrain their mean free paths (MFPs) to the scale of a single atomic layer. In this work, we provide the first direct experimental evidence for ultrashort orbital MFPs in heavy metals (HMs) - W, Ta, Pt - revealed by femtosecond terahertz emission spectroscopy. This is enabled by sub-nanometer-precision control of thin-film thickness using wedge-shaped HM|Ni heterostructures. By employing a multi-component terahertz-emission model, we quantitatively extract the orbital MFPs, consistently finding them shorter than their spin counterparts. Furthermore, control experiments rule out interfacial orbital-to-charge conversion as the dominant mechanism, confirming that the process is governed by the bulk inverse orbital Hall effect. Our findings resolve a central controversy in orbitronics and provide key insights into orbital transport and conversion mechanisms.

Title: Designing Optimal Distorted-Octahedra Superlattices for Strong Topological Hall Effect
Authors: Yiyan Fan, Qinghua Zhang, Jingdi Lu, Chuanrui Huo, Tianyang Wang, Qiao Jin, Ting Cui, Qianying Wang, Dongke Rong, Shiqing Deng, Lingfei Wang, Kuijuan Jin, Jun Chen, Er-Jia Guo
Abstract: Topologically protected spin states hold great promise for applications in next generation of memory circuits and spintronic devices. These intriguing textures typically emerge in bulk materials or heterostructures with broken inversion symmetry, accompanied by an enhanced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In this study, we successfully induced the topological Hall effect (THE) in atomically designed (DyScO3)n/(SrRuO3)n (DnSn) superlattices over a significant range of temperatures (10~120K) and thicknesses (16~40nm). Using magnetic force microscopy (MFM), we observed the formation and stability of magnetic domains, such as topological skyrmions. By precisely controlling the interlayer thickness (n) and biaxial strain, we elucidated the mechanisms underlying the modulation and induction of magnetic topological states. Supporting evidence was provided by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), thereby lending further credence to our conclusions. These heterostructures offer a universal method for exploring topological phenomena driven by distorted octahedra, while enhancing the integrability and addressability of topologically protected functional devices.

Title: Optical-vortex-pulse induced nonequilibrium spin textures in spin-orbit coupled electrons
Authors: Shunki Yamamoto, Masahiro Sato, Satoshi Fujimoto, Takeshi Mizushima
Abstract: Optical vortex beams are a type of topological light characterized by their inherent orbital angular momentum, leading to the propagation of a spiral-shaped wavefront. In this study, we focus on two-dimensional electrons with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions and examine how they respond to pulsed vortex beams in the terahertz frequency band. Spin-orbital interactions play a vital role in transferring the orbital angular momentum of light to electron systems and generating spatiotemporal spin textures. We show that the spatiotemporal spin polarization of electrons reflects orbital angular momentum carried by optical vortex pulses. These findings demonstrate how optical vortices facilitate ultrafast spin manipulation in spin-orbit-coupled electrons. Our results can be straightforwardly extended to the case of higher-frequency vortex beams for other two-dimensional metals with a larger Fermi energy.

Title: Spin-dependent electronic transport in NiMnSb/MoS2(001)/NiMnSb magnetic tunnel junction
Authors: Aloka Ranjan Sahoo, Sharat Chandra
Abstract: Half-metallic Heusler alloy compounds with Curie temperatures above room temperature are suitable candidate electrode materials for injecting large spin-polarised charge carriers into the semiconducting barriers at the ferromagnet semiconductor junction to obtain highly spin-polarised current. Combining the density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function method, the electronic structure, spin dependent electron transport in NiMnSb/MoS2(001)/NiMnSb is studied. The possibilities of injecting 100% spin-polarised electron into MoS2 using half metallic NiMnSb as an electrode, the layer dependent, and the effect of the type of interface on electronic structure and spin-transport properties in magnetic tunnel junction devices are studied. We show that the half-metallicity of NiMnSb(111) is preserved at the interface between the half-Heusler alloy NiMnSb and MoS2. NiMnSb keeps a fully spin-polarised state in the majority spin channel at the interface between NiMnSb and MoS2, injecting fully spin-polarised electrons into the semiconductor. The device based on NiMnSb/MoS2(single layer)/NiMnSb has a metallic interface. Metal-induced states in the spin-majority channel of MoS2 are seen after making an interface with half metallic NiMnSb. In contrast, the NiMnSb/MoS2(three layers)/NiMnSb interface with a multilayer of MoS2 has a band gap region, and electrons can tunnel through the junction. The Mn-S interface is more conducting than the Sb-S interface due to the strong bonding of Mn and S atoms at the Mn-S interface.

Title: Can we build a transistor using vacancy-induced bound states in a topological insulator
Authors: Cunyuan Jiang
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) have been considered as promising candidates for next generation of electronic devices due to their topologically protected quantum transport phenomena. In this work, a scheme for atomic-scale field effect transistor (FET) based on vacancy-induced edge states in TIs is promoted. By designing the positions of vacancies, the closed channel between source and drain terminals provided by vacancy-induced edge states can have the energy spectra with a gap between edge and bulk states. When gate terminal receive the signal, electric field applied by gate terminal can shift quasi Fermi energy of the closed channel from edge states into the gap, and hence open the channel between source and drain terminals. The energy spectra and the effect of electric field are demonstrated using Haldane model and density functional theory (DFT) respectively. This work suggest possible revolutionary applicational potentials of vacancy-induced edge states in topological insulators for atomic-scale electronics.

Title: A diagrammatic approach to correlation functions in superfluids
Authors: Alessia Biondi, Maria Luisa Chiofalo, Massimo Mannarelli, Silvia Trabucco
Abstract: Renaud Parentani has given a vast contribution to the development of gravitational analogue models as tools to explore various important aspects of general relativity and of quantum field theory in curved space-time. In these systems, two-point correlation functions are of the utmost importance for the characterization of processes taking place close to the acoustic horizon. In the present paper, dedicated to him, we present a study of path integral methods that allow to determine two-point correlation functions by a perturbative expansion, in a way that -- beyond its generality -- is especially suited to analyze these processes. Our results apply to non-relativistic superfluids, realizable in terrestrial experiments, as well as to relativistic superfluids, relevant for compact stellar objects.

Title: Designing cobalt-free face-centered cubic high-entropy alloys: A strategy using d-orbital energy level
Authors: Yulin Li, Artur Olejarz, Lukasz Kurpaska, Eryang Lu, Mikko J. Alava, Hyoung Seop Kim, Wenyi Huo
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are promising materials for high-temperature structural applications such as nuclear reactors due to their outstanding mechanical properties and thermal stability. Instead of the trial-and-error method, it is efficient to design and prepare single-phase face-centered cubic (FCC) structured HEAs using semi-empirical phase formation rules. However, almost all of phase formation rules were proposed without taking into account the cobalt-free situation. The HEAs containing cobalt are unsuitable for nuclear applications because of the long-term activation of cobalt. Here, six parameters, d-orbital energy level, valance electron concentration, entropy of mixing, enthalpy of mixing, atom size differences, and parameter of the entropy of mixing ({\Omega}) were calculated to determine the solid solution phase, especially the FCC phase formation rules in cobalt-free HEAs. HEAs of 4 components were arc melted to verify the newly developed phase formation rules. The nanomechanical properties of produced HEAs were evaluated using nanoindentation. Among the six parameters, the d-orbital energy level and valance electron concentration are the critical factors that determine the FCC phase stability in cobalt-free alloys. Interestingly, the d-orbital energy level can be alone used as a benchmark for developing mechanical properties.

Title: Emergent epithelial elasticity governed by interfacial surface mechanics and substrate interaction
Authors: Urska Andrensek, Matej Krajnc
Abstract: During the life of animals, epithelial tissues undergo extensive deformations--first to form organs during embryogensis and later to preserve integrity and function in adulthood. To what extent these deformations resemble that of non-living elastic materials is not well understood. We derive an elasticity theory of epithelia, supported by a thin layer of extracellular material and the stroma, in which the mechanics of individual cells are dominated by differential interfacial tensions stemming from cell cortical tension and adhesion. Upon coarse-graining a discrete single-cell-level mechanics model, we obtain a harmonic deformation energy and derive the critical conditions for the elastic instability, where an initially flat tissue either buckles out of plane or forms wrinkles. Due to the distinct origin of elasticity, the scaling of the critical load to induce an instability and the wrinkling wavelength with layer thickness is fundamentally different than in solid plates. The theory also naturally describes reversal of the groove-to-crest thickness-modulation phase--a recently observed epithelial shape feature which cannot be explained by the classical elasticity theory. Our work provides a guideline for understanding the relative role of cell surface tensions and the interaction of tissues with substrates during epithelial morphogenesis.

Title: Original mechanism of transformation from soft metallic (sp2/sp3) C12 to ultra-dense and ultra-hard (sp3) semi-conducting C12: Crystal chemistry and DFT characterizations
Authors: Samir F Matar
Abstract: An original mechanism is proposed for a pressure-induced transformation of orthorhombic C12 from ground state normal pressure (NP) sp2/sp3 allotrope to ultra-dense and ultra-hard HP sp3 form. Upon volume decrease, the trigonal C=C parallel segments characterizing glitter-like tfi topology of NP C12 change to crossing C-C segments with the loss of sp2 character accompanied by a large densification with density=3.64 g/cm3, larger than diamond, defining a novel orthorhombic HP C12 with 44T39 topology. The crystal chemistry engineering backed with quantum density functional theory DFT-based calculations let determine the ground state structures and energy derived physical properties. Furthering on that, the E(V) equations of states (EOS) let define the equilibrium NP(E0,V0) allotrope at lower energy and higher volume versus HP(E0, V0) allotrope at higher energy and smaller volume. A potential pressure induced transformation NP to HP was estimated at ~100 GPa, reachable with a diamond anvil cell DAC. Both allotropes were found cohesive and mechanically stable with low and large Vickers hardness magnitudes: HV(tfi C12) =24 GPa and HV(44T39 C12) =90 GPa; the latter being close to diamond hardness (HV ~95 GPa). Besides, both allotropes were found dynamically stable with positive phonon frequencies and a spectroscopic signature of C=C high frequency bands in tfi C12. The electronic band structures show metallic behavior for NP tfi C12 and a small band gap for HP 44T39 C12 letting assign semiconducting properties. The work is meant to open further the scope of C(sp2)and C(sp3) transformation mechanisms that are fundamental in solid state physics and chemistry.

Title: Spin and energy diffusion vs. subdiffusion in disordered spin chains
Authors: J. Herbrych, P. Prelovšek
Abstract: While the high-temperature spin diffusion in spin chains with random local fields has been the subject of numerous studies concerning the phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the energy diffusion in the same models has been much less explored. We show that energy diffusion is faster at weak random fields but becomes essentially equal at strong fields; hence, both diffusions determine the slowest relaxation time scale (Thouless time) in the system. Numerically reachable finite-size systems reveal the anomalously large distribution of diffusion constants with respect to actual field configurations. Despite the exponential-like dependence of diffusion on field strength, results for the sensitivity to twisted boundary conditions are incompatible with the Thouless criterion for localization and the presumable transition to MBL, at least for numerically reachable sizes. In contrast, we find indications for the scenario of subdiffusive transport, in particular in the dynamical diffusivity response.

Title: Domain-wall driven suppression of thermal conductivity in a ferroelectric polycrystal
Authors: Rachid Belrhiti-Nejjar, Manuel Zahn, Patrice Limelette, Max Haas, Lucile Féger, Isabelle Monot-Laffez, Nicolas Horny, Dennis Meier, Fabien Giovannelli, Jan Schultheiß, Guillaume F. Nataf
Abstract: A common strategy for reducing thermal conductivity of polycrystalline systems is to increase the number of grain boundaries. Indeed, grain boundaries enhance the probability of phonon scattering events, which has been applied to control the thermal transport in a wide range of materials, including hard metals, diamond, oxides and 2D systems such as graphene. Here, we report the opposite behavior in improper ferroelectric ErMnO3 polycrystals, where the thermal conductivity decreases with increasing grain size. We attribute this unusual relationship between heat transport and microstructure to phonon scattering at ferroelectric domain walls. The domain walls are more densely packed in larger grains, leading to an inversion of the classical grain-boundary-dominated transport behavior. Our findings open additional avenues for microstructural engineering of materials for thermoelectric and thermal management applications, enabling simultaneous control over mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties.

Title: Entropy Stabilized ZrHfCoNiSnSb Half-Heusler Alloy for Thermoelectric Applications: A Theoretical Prediction
Authors: Rajeev Ranjan
Abstract: Half-Heusler (HH) alloys are potential thermoelectric materials for use at elevated temperatures due to their high Seebeck coefficient and superior mechanical and thermal stability. However, their enhanced lattice thermal conductivity is detrimental to thermoelectric applications. One way to circumvent this problem is to introduce mass disorder at lattice sites by mixing the components of two or more alloys. Such systems are typically stabilized by the entropy of mixing. In this work, using computational tools, we propose a mixed HH, namely, ZrHfCoNiSnSb, which can be formed by the elemental compositions of the parent half-Heuslers ZrNiSn/HfNiSn and HfCoSb/ZrCoSb. We propose that this new compound can be synthesized at elevated temperatures, as its Gibbs free energy is reduced due to higher configurational entropy, making it more thermodynamically stable than the parent compounds under such conditions. Our calculations indicate that it is a dynamically stable semiconductor with a band gap of 0.61 eV. Its lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature is $5.39~\text{Wm}^{-1}\text{K}^{-1}$, which is significantly lower than those of the parent compounds. The peak value of this alloy's figure of merit (ZT) is 1.00 for the n-type carriers at 1100 K, which is 27% more than the best figure of merit obtained for the parent compounds.

Title: Emergent Kitaev materials in synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayers
Authors: Daniel González-Cuadra, Alejandro Bermudez
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of bond-directional spin-spin interactions in a synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayer that can be realized with ultracold fermions in Raman optical lattices. The model exploits synthetic dimensions to couple two honeycomb layers, each corresponding to a different hyperfine atomic state, via Raman-assisted tunneling and, moreover, via an inter-layer Hubbard repulsion due to the cold-atom scattering. In the strong-coupling regime at half filling, we derive effective spin Hamiltonians for the kinetic exchange featuring Kitaev, Heisenberg, off-diagonal exchange ($\Gamma$-couplings), as well as tunable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We identify specific configurations that generate both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev couplings with various perturbations of relevance to Kitaev materials, providing a tunable platform that can explore how quantum spin liquids emerge from itinerant fermion systems. We analyze the Fermi-liquid and Mott-insulating phases, highlighting a correspondence between Dirac and Majorana quasi-particles, with possible phase transitions thereof. In an extreme anisotropic limit, we show that the model reduces to an inter-layer ribbon in a quasi-1D ladder, allowing for a numerical study of the correlated ground state using matrix product states. We find a transition from a symmetry-protected topological insulator to a Kitaev-like regime characterized by nonlocal string order. Our results establish that cold-atom quantum simulators based on Raman optical lattices can be a playground for extended Kitaev models, bridging itinerant fermionic systems and spin-liquid physics.

Title: From Spin Waves to Monte Carlo Simulations: Compiling an Experimental Exchange Interaction Dataset for Magnetic Materials
Authors: Mojtaba Alaei, Zahra Mosleh, Nafise Rezaei, Artem R. Oganov
Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering data on magnetic crystals are highly valuable in materials science, as they provide direct insight into microscopic magnetic interactions. Using spin wave theory, these interactions can be extracted from magnetic excitations observed in such experiments. However, these datasets are often scattered across the literature and lack standardization, limiting their accessibility and usability. In this paper, we compile and standardize Heisenberg exchange interaction data for magnetic materials obtained from inelastic neutron scattering experiments. Through an extensive literature review, we identify experimental data for approximately 100 magnetic materials. The standardized dataset includes mapping the results of various Heisenberg Hamiltonians into a unified standard form, visualizations of crystal structures with annotated exchange interactions, and input and output files from Monte Carlo simulations performed for each compound using the ESpinS code. Using experimentally determined exchange interactions, we calculate transition temperatures $T_c$ via classical Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of the $S+1)/S$ correction within classical Monte Carlo simulations, finding that it produces transition temperatures in excellent agreement with experimental values in most cases.

Title: A primer on Kitaev Model: Basic aspects, material realization, and recent experiments
Authors: Saptarshi Mandal
Abstract: This elementary review article is aimed to the beginning graduate students interested to know basic aspects of Kitaev model. We begin with a very lucid introduction of Kitaev model and present its exact solution, Hilbert space structure, fractionalisation, spin-spin correlation function and topological degeneracy in an elementary way. We then discuss the recent proposal of realizing Kitaev interaction in certain materials. Finally we present some recent experiments done on these materials, mainly magnetization, susceptibility, specific heat and thermal Hall effect to elucidate the recent status of material realization of coveted Kitaev spin-liquid phase. We end with a brief discussion on other theoretical works on Kitaev model from different many-body aspects.

Title: Thermoelectric performance of quantum dots embedded in an Aharonov-Bohm ring: a Pauli master equation approach
Authors: Parbati Senapati, Prakash Parida
Abstract: Within linear response theory using Pauli master equation approach, we have investigated the thermoelectric properties of quantum dots (QDs) embedded in an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring weakly coupled to two metallic electrodes. This study explores the impact of magnetic flux on thermoelectric transport, emphasizing the role of quantum interference induced by the flux. When the magnetic flux is varied from 0 to one quantum of flux $\Phi = \Phi_{0} = \frac{h}{e}$, both the electrical conductance and the thermoelectric figure of merit ($ZT$) significantly increase by two order of magnitude. Moreover, our investigation into the effects of onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions in this nanojunction indicates that an optimal $ZT$ is attained with moderate onsite Coulomb interaction and minimal inter-site Coulomb interaction. We briefly discussed the effects of asymmetric arrangements of triple QDs within an AB ring. However, within our parameter regime, a symmetric arrangement offers superior thermoelectric performance compared to asymmetric configurations. Furthermore, we explored how increasing the number of QDs in the ring enhances the thermoelectric properties, resulting in a potential $ZT$ value of around $0.43$. This study shows that arranging multiple QDs symmetrically in an AB ring can result in significant thermoelectric performance in nanostructured system at low temperatures.

Title: Attractive and repulsive angulons in superfluid environments
Authors: Wei Zhang, Zhongda Zeng, Tao Shi
Abstract: We investigate the in- and out-of-equilibrium phenomena of a rotational impurity -- specifically, a linear molecule -- coupled to a nonconventional environment, a helium nanodroplet. By employing a Lee-Low-Pines-like transformation combined with a multireference configuration approach, we self-consistently account for the molecule's backaction on the superfluid bath and accurately capture the complex entanglement between the molecule's rotational degrees of freedom and the bath excitations. Our findings reveal that, in the ground state, the impurity induces a density defect in the superfluid bath, giving rise to two novel types of excited states: (a) attractive angulon states, analogous to bound states in photonic crystals and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states in superconductors, localized within the density defect region; and (b) long-lived repulsive angulon states in dilute environments. Rotational spectroscopy demonstrates a crossover from repulsive to attractive angulon states as the bath density increases. This work paves the way for exploring novel nonequilibrium phenomena of quantum impurities in interacting environments.

Title: DFT exploration of pressure dependent physical properties of the recently discovered La3Ni2O7 superconductor
Authors: Md. Enamul Haque, Ruman Ali, M. A. Masum, Jahid Hassan, S. H. Naqib
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 under pressure has drawn a lot of interest. La3Ni2O7 is isostructural with cuprates in some respect. Investigation of its properties will undoubtedly provide new insights into high-Tc superconductivity. In the present work, we study structural, mechanical, elastic, optoelectronic, thermophysical properties, and Fermi surface topology of La3Ni2O7 under pressure within the range of 30-40 GPa employing the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated structural parameters agree well with the earlier experimental findings. The structural, mechanical, and thermodynamical stability is justified across the entire pressure range. The computed elastic moduli classify the compound as ductile, and the material's ductility is largely unaffected by pressure. The compound has a high level of machinability index and dry lubricity. The electronic band structure reveals metallic feature of La3Ni2O7. The Debye temperature, thermal conductivity, and melting temperature increase with increasing pressure, but in an anomalous manner. The characteristic peaks in refractive index, reflectivity, and photoconductivity exhibit a small shift towards higher energy for all polarizations of the electric field vector with increasing pressure. The investigated material might be a good ultraviolet radiation absorber and can be used as an anti-reflection system. Moreover, the pressure dependent electronic density of states at the Fermi level, pressure induced negligible variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential, and the changes in the Debye temperature have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.

Title: Instability of oxide perovskite surfaces induced by vacancy formation
Authors: Ned Thaddeus Taylor, Michael Thomas Morgan, Steven Paul Hepplestone
Abstract: This work presents a first principles study of the (001) surface energetics of nine oxide perovskites, with a focus on the role of surface vacancies in determining termination stability. Additionally, investigation into the behaviour of vacancies as a function of depth from the surface in these perovskites, ABO$_{3}$ (A=Ca, Sr, Ba; B=Ti, Zr, Sn), is carried out, and results are compared to formation of the vacancies in bulk. Combining results from these investigations reveals a general trend for all nine perovskites - the undefected AO surface is more energetically favourable to form than the BO2 surface. This dominance of the AO over the BO2 surface is further enforced by the phase diagrams of perovskite surfaces. However, A-site vacancies at the AO surface are far more favourable (1-2 eV lower in energy) than B-site vacancies at the BO2 surface. Charged vacancies only drive this further under oxygen-rich conditions, showing a smaller range of stability for the AO than the BO2 surface. These results indicates that, whilst the AO surface is easier to form, the BO2 surface will display better long term stability, making it more suitable for use in potential applications. This study furthers the understanding of oxide perovskite (001)-terminated surface stability, which will aid in surface growth and manufacturing.

Title: Universal transparency and fine band structure near the Dirac point in HgTe quantum wells
Authors: V. Dziom, A. Shuvaev, J. Gospodaric, E. G. Novik, A. A. Dobretsova, N. N. Mikhailov, Z. D. Kvon, Z. Alpichshev, A. Pimenov
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in thin HgTe quantum wells results in a relativistic-like electron band structure, making it a versatile solid state platform to observe and control non-trivial electrodynamic phenomena. Here we report an observation of universal terahertz (THz) transparency determined by fine-structure constant $\alpha \approx 1/137$ in 6.5 nm-thick HgTe layer, close to the critical thickness separating phases with topologically different electronic band structure. Using THz spectroscopy in magnetic field we obtain direct evidence of asymmetric spin splitting of the Dirac cone. This particle-hole asymmetry facilitates optical control of edge spin currents in the quantum wells.

Title: Defects, Sound Damping, and the Boson Peak in Amorphous Solids
Authors: Elijah Flenner, Grzegorz Szamel
Abstract: Two nearly universal and anomalous properties of glasses, the peak in the specific heat and plateau of the thermal conductivity, occur around the same temperature. This coincidence suggests that the two phenomena are related. Both effects can be rationalized by assuming Rayleigh scaling of sound attenuation and this scaling leads one to consider scattering from defects. Identifying defects in glasses, which are inherently disordered, is a long-standing problem that was approached in several ways. We examine candidates for defects in glasses that represent areas of strong sound damping. We show that some defects are associated with quasi-localized excitations, which may be associated with modes in excess of the Debye theory. We also examine generalized Debye relations, which relate sound damping and the speed of sound to excess modes. We derive a generalized Debye relation that does not resort to an approximation used by previous authors. We find that our relation and the relation given by previous authors are almost identical at small frequencies and also reproduce the independently determined density of states. However, the different generalized Debye relations do not agree around the boson peak. While generalized Debye relations accurately predict the boson peak in two-dimensional glasses, they under estimate the boson peak in three-dimensional glasses.

Title: Improving robustness and training efficiency of machine-learned potentials by incorporating short-range empirical potentials
Authors: Zihan Yan, Zheyong Fan, Yizhou Zhu
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are powerful tools for materials modeling, but their performance is often limited by training dataset quality, particularly the lack of rare event configurations. This limitation undermines their accuracy and robustness in long-time and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we present a hybrid MLFF framework that integrates an empirical short-range repulsive potential and demonstrates improved robustness and training efficiency. Using solid electrolyte Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$ (LLZO) as a model system, we show that purely data-driven MLFFs fail to prevent unphysical atomistic clustering in extended simulations due to inadequate short-range repulsion. In contrast, the hybrid force field eliminates these artifacts, enabling stable long-time simulations, which are critical for studying various properties of LLZO. The hybrid framework also reduces the need for extensive active learning and performs well with just 25 training configurations. By combining physics-driven constraints with data-driven flexibility, this approach is compatible with most existing MLFF architectures and establishes a universal paradigm for developing robust, training-efficient force fields for complex material systems.

Title: ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$: A Promising Kagome Antiferromagnetic Candidate for Room-Temperature Nernst Effect-based thermoelectrics
Authors: Olajumoke Oluwatobiloba Emmanuel, Shuvankar Gupta, Xianglin Ke
Abstract: The Nernst effect, the generation of a transverse electric voltage in the presence of longitudinal thermal gradient, has garnered significant attention in the realm of magnetic topological materials due to its superior potential for thermoelectric applications. In this work, we investigate electronic and thermoelectric transport properties of a Kagome magnet ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$, a compound showing an incommensurate antiferromagnetic phase followed by a ferrimagnetic phase transition upon cooling. We show that in the antiferromagnetic phase ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$ exhibits both topological Nernst effect and anomalous Nernst effect, analogous to the electric Hall effects, with the Nernst coefficient reaching 1.71 uV/K at 300 K and 3 T. This value surpasses that of most of previously reported state-of-the-art canted antiferromagnetic materials and is comparable to recently reported other members of RMn$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = rare-earth, Y, Lu, Sc) compounds, which makes ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$ a promising candidate for advancing the development of Nernst effect-based thermoelectric devices.

Title: Full Crystallographic Imaging of Hexagonal Boron Nitride Monolayers with Phonon-Enhanced Sum-Frequency Microscopy
Authors: Niclas S. Mueller, Alexander P. Fellows, Ben Johna, Andrew E. Naclerio, Christian Carbogno, Katayoun Gharagozloo-Hubmann, Damián Baláž, Ryan A. Kowalski, Hendrik H. Heenen, Christoph Scheurer, Karsten Reuter, Joshua D. Caldwell, Martin Wolf, Piran R. Kidambi, Martin Thämer, Alexander Paarmann
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an important 2D material for van der Waals heterostructures, single photon emitters, and infrared nanophotonics. The optical characterization of mono- and few-layer samples of hBN however remains a challenge as the material is almost invisible optically. Here we introduce phase-resolved sum-frequency microscopy as a technique for imaging monolayers of hBN grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and visualize their crystal orientation. A combination of femtosecond mid-infrared (IR) and visible laser pulses is used for sum-frequency generation (SFG), which is imaged in a wide-field optical microscope. The IR laser resonantly excites a phonon of hBN that leads to an ~800-fold enhancement of the SFG intensity, making it possible to image large 100x100 {\mu}m2 sample areas in less than 1 s. Implementing heterodyne detection in combination with azimuthal rotation of the sample further provides full crystallographic information. Through combined knowledge of topography and crystal orientation, we find that triangular domains of CVD-grown monolayer hBN have nitrogen-terminated zigzag edges. Overall, SFG microscopy can be used as an ultra-sensitive tool to image crystal structure, strain, stacking sequences, and twist angles, and is applicable to the wide range of van der Waals structures, where location and identification of monolayer regions and interfaces with broken inversion symmetry is of paramount importance.

Title: Ge$_{1-x}$Si$_{x}$ single crystals for Ge hole spin qubit integration

Abstract: Spin qubits are fundamental building blocks of modern quantum computing devices. The path of Ge-based hole-spin qubits has several advantages over Si-based electron-spin systems, such as the absence of valley band degeneracy, the possibility of efficient field control due to large spin-orbit coupling, and smaller effective masses. Among the possible Ge qubit devices, Ge/GeSi planar heterostructures have proven to be favourable for upscaling and fabrication. The Si concentration of the straining GeSi buffer serves as an important tuning parameter for the electronic structure of Ge/GeSi qubits. A particularly low Si concentration of x = 0.15 of the Ge$_{0.85}$Si$_{0.15}$ crystal should enable minimal lattice strain for spin qubit heterostructures, which is difficult to stabilize as a random alloy. We present a synchrotron-based study to investigate the chemical composition, valence band electronic structure and local atomic structure of a Ge$_{0.85}$Si$_{0.15}$ single crystal using the advanced combination of hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES), hard X-ray momentum microscopy (HarMoMic) and X-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD). We found that the Ge$_{0.85}$Si$_{0.15}$ crystal has an individual, uniform valence band structure, with no signs of phase separation. The shapes of the valence bands resemble those of pure Ge, as do the low effective masses. XPD experiments and Bloch wave calculations, show the Si atoms located at Ge lattice sites within the crystal, forming a random alloy. This high chemical, electronic and structural quality of Ge$_{0.85}$Si$_{0.15}$ single-crystal substrates is of crucial importance for their implementation to enable long spin lifetimes in Ge-based hole-spin qubits. The results emphasise the power of combined X-ray spectromicroscopy techniques, which provide key insights into the qubit building blocks that form the basis of quantum technologies.

Title: Criticality and magnetic phases of Ising Shastry-Sutherland candidate holmium tetraboride
Authors: Guga Khundzakishvili, Bishnu P. Belbase, Pravin Mahendran, Kevin Zhang, Hanjing Xu, Eliana Stoyanoff, Joseph G. Checkelsky, Yaohua Liu, Linda Ye, Arnab Banerjee
Abstract: Frustrated magnetic systems arising in geometrically constrained lattices represent rich platforms for exploring unconventional phases of matter, including fractional magnetization plateaus, incommensurate orders, and complex domain dynamics. However, determining the microscopic spin configurations that stabilize such phases is a key challenge, especially when in-plane and out-of-plane spin components coexist and compete. Here, we combine neutron scattering and magnetic susceptibility experiments with simulations to investigate the emergence of field-induced fractional plateaus and the related criticality in a frustrated magnet holmium tetraboride (HoB4) that represents the family of rare earth tetraborides that crystalize in a Shastry-Sutherland lattice in the ab plane. We focus on the interplay between classical and quantum criticality near phase boundaries as well as the role of material defects in the stabilization of the ordered phases. We find that simulations using classical annealing can explain certain observed features in the experimental Laue diffraction and the origin of multiple magnetization plateaus. Our results show that defects and out of plane interactions play an important role and can guide the route towards resolving microscopic spin textures in highly frustrated magnets.

Title: Thermal rectification and phonon properties in partially perforated graphene
Authors: Markos Poulos, Konstantinos Termentzidis
Abstract: In this work, a thermal rectification ratio $\eta$ of 18.5% was observed in partially perforated graphene with the use of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. In all cases studied here, heat preferentially flows from the porous to the pristine region and both $\kappa$ and $\eta$ increase upon increasing the length of the pristine region and upon decreasing the size of the pores. To interpret the results, the macroscopic "R-Series Model" is applied, attributing rectification to the different temperature dependence of $\kappa$ of perforated and pristine graphene. According to the model, $\eta$ is maximized when the two regions composing the structure have matching thermal resistances and mismatching temperature-dependence of $\kappa$. The model agrees qualitatively with the MD results, indicating that the latter is the principal rectification mechanism, but it can significantly underestimate $\eta$. Phonon analysis further reveals the appearance of new 'defect' modes localized around and between pores, resulting in the emergence of a new prominent peak in the phonon Density of States at 520 $cm^{-1}$. The study considers key geometric factors such as the length of the pristine region, and the pore size, shape, alignment, and orientation. Pore shape and alignment exert minimal influence on $\eta$, although alignment greatly influences $\kappa$. Eventually, arranged pores are deemed more efficient than randomly distributed defects for increasing rectification.

Title: From observed transitions to hidden paths in Markov networks
Authors: Alexander M. Maier, Udo Seifert, Jann van der Meer
Abstract: The number of observable degrees of freedom is typically limited in experiments. Here, we consider discrete Markov networks in which an observer has access to a few visible transitions and the waiting times between these transitions. Focusing on the underlying structure of a discrete network, we present methods to infer local and global properties of the network from observed data. First, we derive bounds on the microscopic entropy production along the hidden paths between two visible transitions, which complement extant bounds on mean entropy production and affinities of hidden cycles. Second, we demonstrate how the operationally accessible data encodes information about the topology of shortest hidden paths, which can be used to identify potential clusters of states or exclude their existence. Finally, we outline a systematic way to combine the inferred data, resulting in an algorithm that finds the candidates for a minimal graph of the underlying network, i.e., a graph that is part of the original one and compatible with the observations. Our results highlight the interplay between thermodynamic methods, waiting-time distributions and topological aspects like network structure, which can be expected to provide novel insights in other set-ups of coarse graining as well.

Title: Locally Machine-Learnability of Density of Electronic States
Authors: A. Aryanpour, Ali Sadeghi
Abstract: The electronic density of states (DOS) plays a crucial role in determining the properties of materials. In this study, we investigate the machine learnability of additive atomic contributions to the electronic DOS. Our approach focuses on atom-projected DOS rather than structural DOS. This method for structure-property mapping is both scalable and transferable, achieving high prediction accuracy for pure and compound silicon and carbon structures of varying sizes and configurations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the complex Sn-S-Se compound structures. By employing locally trained DOS, we significantly enhance the accuracy in predicting secondary material properties, such as band energy, Fermi level, heat capacity, and magnetic susceptibility. Our findings indicate that directly learning atomic DOS, rather than structural DOS, improves the efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability of machine learning in structure-property mapping. This streamlined approach reduces computational complexity, paving the way for the examination of electronic structures in materials without the need for computationally expensive ab initio calculations.

Title: Simulating quantum dynamics in two-dimensional lattices with tensor network influence functional belief propagation
Authors: Gunhee Park, Johnnie Gray, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: Describing nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a significant computational challenge due to the growth of spatial entanglement. The tensor network influence functional (TN-IF) approach mitigates this problem for computing the time evolution of local observables by encoding the subsystem's influence functional path integral as a matrix product state (MPS), thereby shifting the resource governing computational cost from spatial entanglement to temporal entanglement. We extend the applicability of the TN-IF method to two-dimensional lattices by demonstrating its construction on tree lattices and proposing a belief propagation (BP) algorithm for the TN-IF, termed influence functional BP (IF-BP), to simulate local observable dynamics on arbitrary graphs. Even though the BP algorithm introduces uncontrolled approximation errors on arbitrary graphs, it provides an accurate description for locally tree-like lattices. Numerical simulations of the kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice, motivated by a recent quantum experiment, highlight the effectiveness of the IF-BP method, which demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-time dynamics where traditional tensor network state-based methods struggle. Our results further reveal that the temporal entanglement entropy (TEE) only grows logarithmically with time for this model, resulting in a polynomial computational cost for the whole method. We further construct a cluster expansion of IF-BP to introduce loop correlations beyond the BP approximation, providing a systematic correction to the IF-BP estimate. We demonstrate the power of the cluster expansion of the IF-BP in simulating the quantum quench dynamics of the 2D transverse field Ising model, obtaining numerical results that improve on the state-of-the-art.

Title: Canonical ensemble of a $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordström black hole in a cavity
Authors: Tiago V. Fernandes, José P. S. Lemos
Abstract: We construct the canonical ensemble of a $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordström black hole spacetime in a cavity surrounded by a heat reservoir through the Euclidean path integral formalism. The heat reservoir is described by the boundary of the cavity with fixed radius $R$, fixed temperature $T$, and fixed electric charge $Q$. We use York's approach to find the reduced action, and then perform a zero loop approximation. We find that the number of solutions for the black hole depends on the electric charge being smaller or larger than a critical $Q_s$, having two stable and one unstable solutions for the former case, and one stable solution for the latter. We obtain the system's thermodynamic properties from the partition function. We analyze thermodynamic stability, controlled by the positivity of the heat capacity at constant area and electric charge. We show that there is a discontinuity in the heat capacity, signaling a turning point. We investigate the favorable stable phases and the phase diagram of the system. We show that the two stable black hole solutions can suffer a first order phase transition from one to the other, and at the critical charge $Q_s$ this turns into a second order one. We introduce a model of charged hot flat space, i.e., hot flat space with charge near the boundary. We find that a first order phase transition between the large stable black hole and charged hot flat space occurs at a horizon radius larger than the Buchdahl bound, and comment on the physics. Finally, we recover the Davies thermodynamic solutions and a Rindler solution in the limit of infinite cavity, and the York solutions in the limit of zero charge. Hence, both York and Davies formalisms are unified and connected in our approach. In all instances we mention carefully the four-dimensional case, for which we accomplish new results, and study in detail all aspects of the five-dimensional case.

Title: Non-Hermitian wave turbulence
Authors: Xander M. de Wit, Sébastien Galtier, Michel Fruchart, Federico Toschi, Vincenzo Vitelli
Abstract: Wave turbulence describes the long-time statistical behavior of out-of-equilibrium systems composed of weakly interacting waves. Non-Hermitian media ranging from open quantum systems to active materials can sustain wave propagation in so-called $PT$-symmetric states where gain and loss are effectively balanced. Here, we derive the kinetic equations governing wave turbulence in a prototypical non-Hermitian medium: a three-dimensional fluid with odd viscosity. We calculate its exact anisotropic solution, the so-called Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum, and validate the existence of this regime using direct numerical simulations. This non-Hermitian wave turbulence generates a direct cascade that is sustained down to the smallest scales, suppressing the transition to strong turbulence typically observed in rotating fluids and electron magnetohydrodynamics. Beyond odd viscous fluids, this qualitative mechanism applies to any non-linear system of waves where non-Hermitian effects are enhanced at small scales through gradient terms in the dynamical equations, e.g. via odd elastic moduli or other non-reciprocal responses.

Title: The Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-quantum electrodynamics
Authors: M. J. Neves
Abstract: The Lee-Wick pseudo-quantum electrodynamics in the presence of a Chern-Simons term is studied in this paper. The paper starts with a non-local lagrangian density that sets the Lee-Wick electrodynamics defined on a bidimensional space added to the Chern-Simons topological term. We investigate classical aspects as the potential energy for the interaction of static charges through the gauge propagator. The gauge field of the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons electrodynamics is minimally coupled to the fermions sector that includes new degree of freedom, as a Lee-Wick heavy fermion partner of the electron. The perturbative approach for the theory is presented via effective action in which we obtain the Ward identities. We study the radiative corrections at one loop for the electron self-energy, the vacuum polarization, and the $3$-vertex through the Ward identity. We show that the Lee-Wick mass has a fundamental role in these results.

Title: Long-lived entanglement of a spin-qubit register in silicon photonics
Authors: Hanbin Song, Xueyue Zhang, Lukasz Komza, Niccolo Fiaschi, Yihuang Xiong, Yiyang Zhi, Scott Dhuey, Adam Schwartzberg, Thomas Schenkel, Geoffroy Hautier, Zi-Huai Zhang, Alp Sipahigil
Abstract: Color centers provide an optical interface to quantum registers based on electron and nuclear spin qubits in solids. The T center in silicon is an emerging spin-photon interface that combines telecom O-band optical transitions and a long-lived electron spin in a scalable photonics platform. In this work, we demonstrate the initialization, coherent control, and state readout of a three-qubit register based on the electron spin of a T center coupled to a hydrogen and a silicon nuclear spin. The spin register exhibits long spin echo coherence times of $0.41(2)$ ms for the electron spin, $112(12)$ ms for the hydrogen nuclear spin, and $67(7)$ ms for the silicon nuclear spin. We use nuclear-nuclear two-qubit gates to generate entanglement between the two nuclear spins with a fidelity of $F=0.77(3)$ and a coherence time of $T^*_2=2.60(8)$ ms. Our results show that T centers can realize a long-lived multi-qubit register with an optical interface in silicon photonics.

Title: Mapping molecular polariton transport via pump-probe microscopy
Authors: Piper Fowler-Wright, Michael Reitz, Joel Yuen-Zhou
Abstract: We demonstrate how the transport properties of molecular polaritons in optical cavities can be extracted from a microscopic modeling of pump-probe spectroscopy. Our approach combines a mean-field treatment of the light-matter Hamiltonian with a perturbative expansion of both light and matter components, along with spatial coarse-graining. This approach extends semiclassical cavity spectroscopy to multimode light-matter interactions, providing full access to spatially resolved transient spectra. By simulating a microscopy experiment with counter-propagating pump and probe pulses, we compute the differential transmission and show how molecular dephasing and persistent dark exciton populations drive sub-group-velocity transport of the root-mean-square displacement. We analyze transport across the polariton dispersion, showing how velocity renormalization correlates with excitonic weight, consistent with experimental observations, and further its dependence on the rate of molecular dephasing. Our results highlight the need to consider measured spectroscopic observables when characterizing transport in polaritonic systems.

Title: Coupled Instantons In A Four-Well Potential With Application To The Tunneling Of A Composite Particle
Authors: Pervez Hoodbhoy, M. Haashir Ismail, M. Mufassir
Abstract: Coupled instantons are introduced by generalizing the double well potential to multiple mutually coupled wells. Physically this corresponds to the simultaneous tunneling of multiple degrees of freedom. A system with four equal minima is examined in detail. It has three instanton types or flavors with distinct actions. For weak coupling and subject to there being a single large (or small) parameter, the interactive system can be handled perturbatively. The zero mode problem arising from time translation symmetry is handled via the Fadeev-Popov procedure. A diagrammatic procedure allows corrections to the fluctuation determinant to be calculated systematically. Independent instanton contributions are summed over by extending the dilute gas approximation to three flavors and energy splittings of the lowest four states is calculated. All tunneling amplitudes are concisely expressed in terms of elementary functions. While the model is possibly useful for a variety of physical systems, an application is made here to the tunneling of a composite particle in one dimension.

Title: Atomically-Thin Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanolasers: Challenges and Opportunities
Authors: Teresa López-Carrasco, Marcos H.D. Guimarães
Abstract: Low energy consumption nanolasers are crucial for advancing on-chip integrated optical interconnects and photonic integrated circuits. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional semiconductor materials for nanolaser optical gain medium, promising ultralow lasing threshold powers. While several studies suggest that TMDs meet the criteria for lasing, whether true lasing has been achieved remains a topic of heavy debate within the scientific community. In this perspective, we offer an overview of the field, outlining the key characteristics of laser light and methods for testing these properties in TMD-based devices. We then conduct a thorough review of recent reports claiming lasing, assessing the findings against established criteria for laser light emission. Finally, we discuss future research directions and applications, highlighting the key challenges that must be addressed to realize practical TMD-based nanolasers.

Title: A new representation formula for the logarithmic corotational derivative -- a case study in application of commutator based functional calculus
Authors: Michal Bathory, Miroslav Bulíček, Josef Málek, Vít Průša
Abstract: The logarithmic corotational derivative is a key concept in rate-type constitutive relations in continuum mechanics. The derivative is defined in terms of the logarithmic spin tensor, which is a skew-symmetric tensor/matrix given by a relatively complex formula. Using a newly developed commutator based functional calculus, we derive a new representation formula for the logarithmic spin tensor. In addition to the result on the logarithmic corotational derivative we also use the newly developed functional calculus to answer some problems regarding the matrix logarithm and the monotonicity of stress-strain relations. These results document that the commutator based functional calculus is of general use in tensor/matrix analysis, and that the calculus allows one to seamlessly work with tensor/matrix valued functions and their derivatives.

Title: (Thermo-)dynamics of the spin-boson model in the weak coupling regime: Application as a quantum battery
Authors: Mahima Yadav, Devvrat Tiwari, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: We investigate the spin-boson model's dynamical and thermodynamic features in the weak coupling regime using the weak coupling spin-boson (WCSB) and phase covariant (PC) master equations. Both unital (pure dephasing) and non-unital (dissipative) quantum channels are considered. On the dynamical side, we explore key quantum features including non-Markovianity, quantum speed limit, quantum coherence, and the system's steady-state behavior. Notably, the measures of non-Markovianity exhibit different behavior under WCSB and PC dynamics. From the quantum thermodynamic perspective, we conceptualize the spin-boson system as a quantum battery and analyze its performance through metrics such as energy, ergotropy, anti-ergotropy, and battery capacity. We further examine the roles of pure dephasing and dissipative processes in shaping the battery's performance. Our findings demonstrate the spin-boson model's versatility as a platform for efficient energy storage and transfer in quantum thermodynamic devices.

Title: Positive-tone Nanolithography of Antimony Trisulfide with Femtosecond Laser Wet-etching
Authors: Abhrodeep Dey, Uwe Hübner, Albane Benardais, Xiaofei Wu, Andrea Dellith, Jan Dellith, Torsten Wieduwilt, Henrik Schneidewind, Markus A Schmidt, Virginie Nazabal, Volker Deckert, Jer-Shing Huang, Wei Wang
Abstract: Antimony trisulfide ($Sb_{2}S_{3}$), as an emerging material for integrated photonic devices, has attracted significant attention due to its high index, low loss, and phase-changing property in the optical regime. However, conventional lithography-based fabrication methods involve complex, time-consuming, multistep processes, rendering the photonic application of $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ challenging. Here, we demonstrate that positive-tone fabrication of $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ nanostructures using wet-etch femtosecond laser processing, a straightforward technique for the engraving of micro- and nanoscale structures, can address major fabrication challenges. The patterning mechanism and factors influencing resolution of $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ thin film structures deposited on quartz (transmissive) and gold (reflective) substrates are experimentally investigated and supported by theoretical modelling. Using this approach, the smallest linewidth fabricated is measured at 178 nm. Consequently, multiple test patterns are demonstrated showing versatile functionalities. Functional Fresnel Zone Plates (FZPs) with varying focal length are fabricated and characterized. This study provides a significantly simplified approach for realizing $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ based integrated photonic devices.

Title: Lax dynamics
Authors: Stefano Lepri
Abstract: A novel approach is proposed to characterize the dynamics of perturbed many-body integrable systems. Focusing on the paradigmatic case of the Toda chain under non-integrable Hamiltonian perturbations, this study introduces a method based the time evolution of the Lax eigenvalues $\lambda_\alpha$ as a proxy of the quasi-particles velocities and of the perturbed Toda actions. A set of exact equations of motion for the $\lambda_\alpha$ is derived that closely resemble those for eigenenergies of a quantum problem (also known as the Pechukas-Yukawa gas). Numerical simulations suggest that the invariant measure of such dynamics is basically the thermal density of states of the Toda lattice, regardless of the form of the perturbation.

Title: Detector of microwave photon pairs based on a Josephson photomultiplier
Authors: E. V. Stolyarov, R. A. Baskov
Abstract: We propose a viable design of a microwave two-photon threshold detector. In essence, the considered scheme is an extension of the existing single-photon detector - a Josephson photomultiplier (JPM) - an absorbing microwave detector based on a capacitively-shunted rf SQUID. To implement a two-photon threshold detector, we utilize a dimer of resonators - two lumped-element resonators interacting via an asymmetric dc SQUID, with one of the resonators capacitively coupled to the JPM. By specific tuning of the resonator frequencies and the external flux through the dc SQUID coupler, we engineer a non-perturbative two-photon coupling between the resonators. This coupling results in the coherent conversion of a photon pair from one resonator into a single photon in another resonator, enabling selective response to quantum states with at least two photons. We also consider an extended coupler design that allows on-demand \textit{in situ} switching of two-photon coupling. In addition, we propose the modified JPM design to improve its performance. Our calculations demonstrate that, for realistic circuit parameters, we can achieve more than $99\%$ fidelity of photon pair detection in less than 50 ns. The considered scheme may serve as a building block for the implementation of efficient photon-number-resolving detectors in circuit QED architecture.

Title: Wilson lines with endpoints in 3d CFT
Authors: Nabil Iqbal, Navonil Neogi
Abstract: In Abelian gauge theories with dynamical matter, Wilson lines can end on the insertions of charged fields. We study the endpoints of Wilson lines in large $N$ bosonic QED$_3$. at its critical point. We first study the stability of an infinite Wilson line in the $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model by computing the appropriate functional determinant at large $N$. We also compute the conformal dimension of the lowest-dimension endpoint of the line to first order in $N^{-1}$. Along the way we calculate the field-strength tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ in the presence of the line with endpoint and discuss a state-operator correspondence for the endpoints, as well as the existence of an OPE that allows two open-ended Wilson lines to be glued together into a single line.

Authors: Heiko Gimperlein, Ruma R. Maity, Apala Majumdar, Michael Oberguggenberger
Abstract: This manuscript establishes a pathway to reconstruct material parameters from measurements within the Landau-de Gennes model for nematic liquid crystals. We present a Bayesian approach to this inverse problem and analyse its properties using given, simulated data for benchmark problems of a planar bistable nematic device. In particular, we discuss the accuracy of the Markov chain Monte Carlo approximations, confidence intervals and the limits of identifiability.

Title: The Cavity Approach to Parallel Dynamics of Ising Spins on a Graph
Authors: I. Neri, D. Bollé
Abstract: We use the cavity method to study parallel dynamics of disordered Ising models on a graph. In particular, we derive a set of recursive equations in single site probabilities of paths propagating along the edges of the graph. These equations are analogous to the cavity equations for equilibrium models and are exact on a tree. On graphs with exclusively directed edges we find an exact expression for the stationary distribution of the spins. We present the phase diagrams for an Ising model on an asymmetric Bethe lattice and for a neural network with Hebbian interactions on an asymmetric scale-free graph. For graphs with a nonzero fraction of symmetric edges the equations can be solved for a finite number of time steps. Theoretical predictions are confirmed by simulation results. Using a heuristic method, the cavity equations are extended to a set of equations that determine the marginals of the stationary distribution of Ising models on graphs with a nonzero fraction of symmetric edges. The results of this method are discussed and compared with simulations.

Title: Static and dynamic properties of a few spin $1/2$ interacting fermions trapped in an harmonic potential
Authors: Abel Rojo-Francàs, Artur Polls, Bruno Juliá-Díaz
Abstract: We provide a detailed study of the properties of a few interacting spin $1/2$ fermions trapped in a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential. The interaction is assumed to be well represented by a contact delta potential. Numerical results obtained by means of direct diagonalization techniques are combined with analytical expressions for both the non-interacting and strongly interacting regime. The $N=2$ case is used to benchmark our numerical techniques with the known exact solution of the problem. After a detailed description of the numerical methods, in a tutorial-like manner, we present the static properties of the system for $N=2, 3, 4$ and 5 particles, e.g. low-energy spectrum, one-body density matrix, ground-state densities. Then, we consider dynamical properties of the system exploring first the excitation of the breathing mode, using the dynamical structure function and corresponding sum-rules, and then a sudden quench of the interaction strength.

Title: Non-thermal electrons open the non-equilibrium pathway of the phase transition in FeRh
Authors: Maximilian Mattern, Steffen Peer Zeuschner, Matthias Rössle, Jon Ander Arregi, Vojtěch Uhlíř, Matias Bargheer
Abstract: We use ultrafast x-ray diffraction to study non-equilibrium pathways of the phase transition in FeRh parametrized by the structural response. By increasing the pump-pulse duration beyond the electron-phonon coupling time, we suppress the electron-phonon non-equilibrium present upon femtosecond laser excitation but still photoexcite electrons to non-thermal states. Irrespective of the pump pulse duration, we find an optically induced nucleation of ferromagnetic domains on an $8\,\text{ps}$ timescale that starts as soon as the successively deposited energy surpasses the site-specific threshold energy. If in contrast, FeRh is only indirectly excited by diffusion of thermalized electrons from an opaque Pt cap layer, the ferromagnetic phase rises on a $50\,\text{ps}$ timescale. These findings unambiguously identify the photo-excitation of non-thermal electrons and not electron-phonon non-equilibria to enable the non-equilibrium pathway of the phase transition in FeRh.

Title: Extremely strong spin-orbit coupling effect in light-element altermagnetic materials
Authors: Shuai Qu, Zhen-Feng Ouyang, Ze-Feng Gao, Hao Sun, Kai Liu, Peng-Jie Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling is a key to realize many novel physical effects in condensed matter physics. Altermagnetic materials possess the duality of real-space antiferromagnetism and reciprocal-space ferromagnetism. It has not been explored that achieving strong spin-orbit coupling effect in light-element altermagnetic materials. In this work, based on symmetry analysis, the first-principles electronic structure calculations plus Dynamical Mean Field Theory, we demonstrate that there is strong spin-orbit coupling effect in light-element altermagnetic materials $\rm NiF_3$ and $\rm FeCO_3$, and then propose a mechanism for realizing such effective spin-orbit coupling. This mechanism reveals the cooperative effect of crystal symmetry, electron occupation, electronegativity, electron correlation, and intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Our work provides an approach for searching light-element altermagnetic materials with an effective strong spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Radial distribution and its spherical harmonics expansion in liquid CO2 at 250 K and 50 bar based on pressure-constant Monte Carlo simulation using Kihara Potential Model
Authors: Koji Kobashi
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to compute the radial distribution function of liquid CO2 at 250 K and 50 bar and its expansion coefficients by spherical harmonics as a function of intermolecular distance up to 20 angstroms for all possible combinations of angular indices l, l prime, and m less than or equal to 8, in contrast to past works of limited combinations. The positions and orientations of CO2 molecules were determined by pressure-constant Monte Carlo simulation using a Kihara potential model. It was found that the radial distribution function had an intense peak at 4.05 angstroms and a broad band at around 7.85 angstroms. The expansion coefficients had prominent structures below approximately 7.5 angstroms, showing positive and/or negative peaks, which indicated that the orientational correlations of the central molecule were intense with the molecules present in that region. It was also found that the peaks of some expansion coefficients were not small even when l = 8. Furthermore, molecular orientations had a tendency to orient along one direction presumably because of the linear form of CO2 molecule.

Title: Electric transport in doped Mott insulators dictated by a non-Ioffe-Larkin composition rule and spinons
Authors: Chuan Chen, Jia-Xin Zhang, Zhi-Jian Song, Zheng-Yu Weng
Abstract: The electric resistivity is examined in the constrained Hilbert space of a doped Mott insulator, which is dictated by a non-Ioffe-Larkin composition rule due to the underlying mutual Chern-Simons topological gauge structure. In the low-temperature pseudogap phase, where holons remain condensed while spinons proliferate, the charge transport is governed by a chiral spinon excitation, comprising a bosonic spin-$1/2$ at the core of a supercurrent vortex. It leads to a vanishing resistivity with the ``confinement'' of the spinons in the superconducting phase but a low-$T$ divergence of the resistivity once the spinon confinement is disrupted by external magnetic fields. In the latter, the chiral spinons will generate a Hall number $n_H =$ doping concentration $ \delta$ and a Nernst effect to signal an underlying long-range entanglement between the charge and spin degrees of freedom. Their presence is further reflected in thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat and spin susceptibility. Finally, in the high-temperature spin-disordered phase, it is shown that the holons exhibit a linear-$T$ resistivity by scattering with the spinons acting as free local moments, which generate randomized gauge fluxes as perceived by the charge degree of freedom.

Title: The Origin of Sound Damping in Amorphous Solids: Defects and Beyond
Authors: Elijah Flenner, Grzegorz Szamel
Abstract: Comprehending sound damping is integral to understanding the anomalous low temperature properties of glasses. After decades of theoretical and experimental studies, Rayleigh scattering scaling of the sound attenuation coefficient with frequency, $\Gamma \sim \omega^{d+1}$, became generally accepted when quantum and finite temperature effects can be neglected. Rayleigh scaling invokes a picture of scattering from defects. However, it is unclear how to define glass defects, or even if defects are necessary for Rayleigh scaling. Here we determine a particle level contribution to sound damping in the Rayleigh scaling regime. We find that there are areas in the glass that contribute more to sound damping than other areas over a range of frequencies, which allows us to define defects. We show that over a range of glass stability, sound damping scales linearly with the fraction of particles in the defects. However, sound is still attenuated in ultra-stable glasses where no defects are identified. We show that sound damping in these glasses is due to nearly uniformly distributed non-affine, microscopic forces that arise after macroscopic deformations of non-centrosymetric structures. To fully understand sound attenuation in glasses one has to consider contributions from defects and a defect-free background, which represents a new paradigm of sound damping in glasses.

Title: Nearest-Neighbours Neural Network architecture for efficient sampling of statistical physics models
Authors: Luca Maria Del Bono, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi, Francesco Zamponi
Abstract: The task of sampling efficiently the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution of disordered systems is important both for the theoretical understanding of these models and for the solution of practical optimization problems. Unfortunately, this task is known to be hard, especially for spin glasses at low temperatures. Recently, many attempts have been made to tackle the problem by mixing classical Monte Carlo schemes with newly devised Neural Networks that learn to propose smart moves. In this article we introduce the Nearest-Neighbours Neural Network (4N) architecture, a physically-interpretable deep architecture whose number of parameters scales linearly with the size of the system and that can be applied to a large variety of topologies. We show that the 4N architecture can accurately learn the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution for the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model, and specifically for some of its most difficult instances. In particular, it captures properties such as the energy, the correlation function and the overlap probability distribution. Finally, we show that the 4N performance increases with the number of layers, in a way that clearly connects to the correlation length of the system, thus providing a simple and interpretable criterion to choose the optimal depth.

Title: Cavity-Driven Attractive Interactions in Quantum Materials
Authors: F. Helmrich, H. S. Adlong, I. Khanonkin, M. Kroner, G. Scalari, J. Faist, A. Imamoglu, T. F. Nova
Abstract: Many-body phenomena in quantum materials emerge from the interplay among a broad continuum of electronic states, and controlling these interactions is critical for engineering novel phases. One promising approach exploits fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field confined within optical cavities to tailor electronic properties. Here, we demonstrate that terahertz cavity photons can mediate attractive interactions in a tunable van der Waals material and reorganize a continuum of electron-hole transitions into an exciton-like state. We introduce a broadband, sub-wavelength time-domain microscope that integrates exfoliated, dual-gated two-dimensional quantum materials into a terahertz cavity. This approach enables the first-ever measurement of the field-tunable bandgap of bilayer graphene at terahertz frequencies while revealing ultrastrong coupling with a vacuum Rabi frequency exceeding $\Omega_{Rabi}/\omega\approx 40\%$ of the bare photon energy. Crucially, we identify a novel cavity-induced resonance emerging from the interband continuum that resembles Coulomb-bound excitons and remains stable across a broad temperature range. By uniting longstanding theoretical predictions with advanced experimental techniques, our findings open new avenues for designing and probing unique light-matter states and realizing hybrid correlated phases in quantum materials.

Title: Second harmonic generation due to spatial structure of radiation beam
Authors: A. A. Gunyaga, M. V. Durnev, S. A. Tarasenko
Abstract: We show that spatially structured radiation generates second harmonic in a two-dimensional system even if the system is homogeneous and isotropic. The effect originates from non-locality of electric response to structured electromagnetic field. We develop an analytical theory of such a second harmonic generation in conducting two-dimensional systems. For the general type of structured radiation, we calculate the emerging electric currents at the double frequency and the emitted second harmonic radiation. The theory applied to twisted light reveals that the angular momentum of light doubles in the second harmonic emission. Our results pave the way for second harmonic generation and structuring in two-dimensional materials beyond the constraints imposed by crystal symmetry.

Title: Nonlinear planar magnetotransport as a probe of the topology of surface states
Authors: Maria Teresa Mercaldo, Mario Cuoco, Carmine Ortix
Abstract: It has been recently established that transport measurements in the nonlinear regime can give direct access to the quantum metric (QM): the real part of the quantum geometric tensor characterizing the geometry of the electronic wavefunctions in a solid. In topological materials, the QM has been so far revealed in thin films of the topological antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ where it provides a direct contribution to longitudinal currents quadratic in the driving electric field. Here we show that the Dirac surface states of strong three-dimensional topological insulators have a QM that can be accessed from the nonlinear transport characteristics in the presence of an externally applied planar magnetic field. A previously unknown intrinsic part of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity carries the signature of the QM while coexisting with the extrinsic part responsible for the so-called bilinear magnetoelectric resistance. We prove that the QM-induced nonlinear magnetotransport carries specific signatures of single Dirac cones. This allows to use it as an efficient diagnostic tool of the bulk topology of three-dimensional non-magnetic insulators.

Title: Ternary nickel hydrides: a new platform for unconventional superconductivity and quantum magnetism
Authors: Mateusz Domanski, Antonio Santacesaria, Paolo Barone, Jose Lorenzana, Wojciech Grochala
Abstract: In this letter, we propose ternary nickel hydrides MNiH2 (M = Li, Na) as new materials that mimic cuprate physics but have important differences and interesting properties. Ni-H bands are wider than in oxides due to shorter bond lengths and covalency is larger than in Ni oxides which leads to a large scale of magnetic interactions. The charge transfer energy is smaller than in LaNiO2 which in cuprates translates to a larger Tc. We notice the formation of the electride band close to the Fermi surface which appears due to H vacancy along the c lattice vector. The considerable difference with cuprates arises from dz2 orbitals hybridization with interstitial orbitals allowing charge transfer to an apical vacancy state and self-doping the cuprate like Ni dx2-y2 H s antibonding bands which suggests that stoichiometric NaNiH2 may already be metallic and superconducting.

Title: Intrinsic Spin Nernst Effect and Chiral Edge Modes in van der Waals Ferromagnetic Insulators: Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vs. Kitaev Interactions
Authors: Verena Brehm, Paweł Sobieszczyk, Alireza Qaiumzadeh
Abstract: The thermomagnetic Nernst effect and chiral edge states are key signatures of nontrivial topology and emerging Berry curvature in magnonic systems. Implementing atomistic spin simulations, we theoretically demonstrate the emergence of chiral magnon edge states at the boundaries of a ferromagnetic hexagonal lattice in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Kitaev interactions, which are robust against nonlinear magnon interactions. In our simulations, we consider the spin parameters of CrI$_3$ as a prototype of van der Waals magnetic layers. We show that the spin accumulation is reduced in the presence of Kitaev spin interactions compared to systems governed by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This reduction stems from the breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry, which leads to a shorter spin coherence length imposed by the Kitaev interaction. We propose that measuring the angular dependence of the Nernst signal in a magnetic field provides an effective indirect method for identifying the microscopic origin of topological magnons. Our findings hold promising potential for advancing next-generation energy-harvesting Nernst materials and facilitating the integration of topological magnetic materials with spintronic-based quantum technologies.

Title: Topological orders with classical Lie group symmetries from coupling electron wires
Authors: Pak Kau Lim, Michael Mulligan, Jeffrey C.Y. Teo
Abstract: We study the topological order that arises from chiral states with ${\rm SU}(N)$ or ${\rm SO}(N)$ edge-state symmetry. This extends our previous study of topological orders that descend from the bosonic $E_8$ quantum Hall state. We use exactly solvable models of coupled electron wires to construct states with ${\rm SU}(m)_n$, ${\rm SO}(m)_n$, or ${\rm Sp}(m)_n$ topological order for various levels $n$. We use our constructions to write down string operators for various non-Abelian anyons. We thereby provide a systematic, model derivation of quantum Hall states, topological superconductors, and spin liquids with emergent non-Abelian quasiparticle excitations, including those of Ising, metaplectic, and Fibonacci type.

Title: A single-phase epitaxially grown ferroelectric perovskite nitride

Abstract: The integration of ferroelectrics with semiconductors is crucial for developing functional devices, such as field-effect transistors, tunnel junctions, and nonvolatile memories. However, the synthesis of high-quality single-crystalline ferroelectric nitride perovskites has been limited, hindering a comprehensive understanding of their switching dynamics and potential applications. Here we report the synthesis and characterizations of epitaxial single-phase ferroelectric cerium tantalum nitride (CeTaN3) on both oxides and semiconductors. The polar symmetry of CeTaN3 was confirmed by observing the atomic displacement of central ions relative to the center of the TaN6 octahedra, as well as through optical second harmonic generation. We observed switchable ferroelectric domains in CeTaN3 films using piezo-response force microscopy, complemented by the characterization of square-like polarization-electric field hysteresis loops. The remanent polarization of CeTaN3 reaches approximately 20 uC/cm2 at room temperature, consistent with theoretical calculations. This work establishes a vital link between ferroelectric nitride perovskites and their practical applications, paving the way for next-generation information and energy-storage devices with enhanced performance, scalability, and manufacturability.

Title: Purely electrical detection of the Néel vector of $p$-wave magnets based on linear and nonlinear conductivities
Authors: Motohiko Ezawa
Abstract: A $p$-wave magnet has a momentum-dependent band structure and zero-net magnetization just as in the case of an altermagnet. It will be useful for high-density and ultra-fast memory. However, it is a nontrivial problem to detect the Néel vector of a $p$-wave magnet because time-reversal symmetry is preserved, while this is not a problem in an altermagnet because the anomalous Hall conductivity is present due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show that it is possible to detect the in-plane component of the Néel vector of the $p$-wave magnet by measuring the transverse and longitudinal Drude conductivity. Remarkably, this measurement is possible without using magnetization. Furthermore, it is possible to detect the $z$-component by measuring nonlinear conductivity including the nonlinear Drude conductivity and quantum-metric induced nonlinear conductivity by introducing tiny magnetization along the $z$ axis. We obtain analytic formulae for them in the first-order perturbation theory, which agree quite well with numerical results without perturbation. Our results will pave a way to spintronic memory based on $p$-wave magnets.

Title: Microscopic fluctuations in the spreading fronts of circular wetting liquid droplets
Authors: J. M. Marcos, J. J. Melendez, R.Cuerno, J. J. Ruiz-Lorenzo
Abstract: We study numerically the kinetic roughening properties of the precursor fronts of nonvolatile liquid droplets spreading on solid substrates, for the case of circular droplets, more frequently addressed in experiments. To this end, we perform kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations of a lattice gas model whose kinetic roughening behavior has been recently assessed in a band geometry [J.\ M.\ Marcos {\em et al.}, Phys.\ Rev.\ E {\bf 105}, 054801 (2022)]. We compare the scaling behaviors of the spreading fronts obtained for the two geometries, in view of the occurrence of, for example, different universality subclasses for different growth geometries for the related important Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. For circular droplets we obtain that the average front position increases (sub-)diffusively as $R\sim t^{\delta}$, where $\delta \lesssim 1/2$ shows a stronger dependence on the conditions considered for temperature and substrate wettability than in band geometry. In spite of this, front fluctuations for circular droplets behave qualitatively similar to those seen for band geometries, with kinetic roughening exponent values which similarly depend on temperature $T$ but become $T$-independent for sufficiently high $T$. Circular droplets also display intrinsic anomalous scaling with different values of the roughness exponent at short and large length scales, and fluctuations statistics which are close to the Tracy-Widom probability distribution function that applies in the corresponding KPZ universality subclass, now the one expected for interfaces with an overall circular symmetry.

Title: Enhanced Kohn-Luttinger topological superconductivity in bands with nontrivial geometry
Authors: Ammar Jahin, Shi-Zeng Lin
Abstract: We study the effect of the electron wavefunction on Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity. The role of the wavefunction is encoded in a complex form factor describing the topology and geometry of the bands. We show that the electron wavefunction significantly impacts the superconducting transition temperature and superconducting order parameter. We illustrate this using the lowest Landau level form factor and find exponential enhancement of Tc for the resulting topological superconductor. We find that the ideal band geometry, which favors a fractional Chern insulator in the flat band limit, has an optimal Tc. Finally, we apply this understanding to a model relevant to rhombohedral graphene multilayers and unravel the importance of the band geometry for achieving robust superconductivity.

Title: Thermalization of a Closed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev System in the Thermodynamic Limit
Authors: Santiago Salazar Jaramillo, Rishabh Jha, Stefan Kehrein
Abstract: The question of thermalization of a closed quantum system is of central interest in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here we present one such study analyzing the dynamics of a closed coupled Majorana SYK system. We have a large-$q$ SYK model prepared initially at equilibrium quenched by introducing a random hopping term, thus leading to non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the final stationary state reaches thermal equilibrium with respect to the Green's functions and energy. Accordingly, the final state is characterized by calculating its final temperature and the thermalization rate. We provide a detailed review of analytical methods and derive the required Kadanoff-Baym equations, which are then solved using the algorithm developed in this work. Our results display rich thermalization dynamics in a closed quantum system in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Excitons and trions in CrSBr bilayers
Authors: M. A. Semina, F. Tabataba-Vakili, A. Rupp, A.S. Baimuratov, A. Högele, M.M. Glazov
Abstract: We study theoretically the neutral and charged excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors with anisotropic dispersion of charge carriers. Such a situation is realized in CrSBr-based van der Waals heterostructures. We calculate the binding energies of excitons and trions and explore their dependence on the mass ratio, dielectric screening, and interlayer distance in bilayer structures. We also address the effects of exciton-light coupling, including the radiative decay and long-range electron-hole exchange interaction, and briefly analyze correlations between the excitons and the Fermi sea of resident electrons. The estimates for CrSBr bilayers are in reasonable agreement with recent experiments.

Title: Hybrid interacting quantum Hall thermal machine
Authors: S. Finocchiaro, D. Ferraro, M. Sassetti, G. Benenti
Abstract: We investigate a hybrid thermal machine based on a single closed quantum Hall edge channel forming a quantum dot. It is tunneling coupled with two quantum Hall states at $\nu = 2$ in contact with reservoirs at different temperatures and chemical potentials. One of these edge states is also driven out-of-equilibrium by means of a periodic train of Lorentzian voltage pulses. This device allows to explore various possible working regimes including the engine, the heat pump and the refrigerator configuration. Regions where two regimes coexist can also be identified. Moreover, the proposed set-up exhibits robustness and in some parameter regions also slightly enhanced performance in the presence of electron-electron interactions.

Title: Disentangling morphology and conductance in amorphous graphene
Authors: Nicolas Gastellu, Ata Madanchi, Lena Simine
Abstract: Amorphous graphene or amorphous monolayer carbon (AMC) is a family of carbon films that exhibit a surprising sensitivity of electronic conductance to morphology. We combine deep learning-enhanced simulation techniques with percolation theory to analyze three morphologically distinct mesoscale AMCs. Our approach avoids the pitfalls of applying periodic boundary conditions to these fundamentally aperiodic systems or equating crystalline inclusions with conducting sites. We reproduce the previously reported dependence of charge conductance on morphology and explore the limitations of partial morphology descriptors in witnessing conductance properties. Finally, we perform crystallinity analysis of conductance networks along the electronic energy spectrum and show that they metamorphose from being localized on crystallites at band edges to localized on defects around the Fermi energy opening the possibility of control through gate voltage.

Title: Anisotropic spin-split states with canted persistent spin textures in two-dimensional Janus $1T^{'}$ $MXX'$ ($M$ = Mo, W; $X\neq X'$= S, Se, Te) controlled by surface alloying
Authors: Moh. Adhib Ulil Absor, Muhammad Arifin, Iman Santoso, Harsojo
Abstract: Two-dimensional tungsten-based transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), $MX_{2}$ ($M$: W, Mo; $X$: S, Se, Te) monolayers (MLs) with a $1T'$ structure, serve as significant-gap quantum spin Hall insulators. However, due to the centrosymmetric nature of these crystals, spin degeneracy persists throughout their electronic band structures, limiting their potential for spintronic applications. By modifying the chalcogen ($X$) atoms in the TMDCs ML surface to create a higly stable Janus $MXX'$ MLs structure, we demonstrate through density-functional theory calculations that substantial spin splitting of the electronic states can be achieved. Taking the Janus $1T'$ WSTe ML as a representative case, we identify pronounced anisotropic spin-splitting bands, with maximum spin splittings of 0.14 eV and 0.10 eV occurring at the highest occupied states and lowest unoccupied states, respectively. These significant band splittings give rise to canted persistent spin textures (PST) in the spin polarization, which differ significantly from those in commonly studied PST materials. We demonstrate that this intricate spin splitting and unique spin textures stem from strong in-plane $p-d$ orbital interactions between tungsten (W) and the chalcogen atoms (Te and Se), driven by the reduced symmetry of the crystal's point group. Further analysis using a $\vec{k}\cdot\vec{p}$ model derived from symmetry considerations corroborates the origins of the observed anisotropic spin splitting and canted PST. the spin-split states are highly sensitive to surface imperfections caused by surface alloying effects, such as variations in the chalcogen composition on the monolayer surface. These findings underscore the potential of Janus $1T'$ $MXX'$ MLs as promising candidates for next-generation spintronic devices.

Title: Deteriorated Interlayer Coupling in Twisted Bilayer Cobaltites

Abstract: A wealth of remarkable behaviors is observed at the interfaces between magnetic oxides due to the coexistence of Coulomb repulsion and interatomic exchange interactions. While previous research has focused on bonded oxide heterointerfaces, studies on magnetism in van der Waals interfaces remain rare. In this study, we stacked two freestanding cobaltites with precisely controlled twist angles. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed clear and ordered moiré patterns, which exhibit an inverse relationship with the twist angle. We found that the Curie temperature in the twisted region is reduced by approximately 13 K compared to the single-layer region using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry. This phenomenon may be related to the weakening of the orbital hybridization between oxygen ions and transition metal ions in the unbonded interfaces. Our findings suggest a potential avenue for modulating magnetic interactions in correlated systems through twist, providing opportunities for the discovery of unknown quantum states.

Title: Floquet-Bloch Valleytronics
Authors: Sotirios Fragkos, Baptiste Fabre, Olena Tkach, Stéphane Petit, Dominique Descamps, Gerd Schönhense, Yann Mairesse, Michael Schüler, Samuel Beaulieu
Abstract: Driving quantum materials out-of-equilibrium makes it possible to generate states of matter inaccessible through standard equilibrium tuning methods. Upon time-periodic coherent driving of electrons using electromagnetic fields, the emergence of Floquet-Bloch states enables the creation and control of exotic quantum phases. In transition metal dichalcogenides, broken inversion symmetry within each monolayer results in a non-zero Berry curvature at the K and K$^{\prime}$ valley extrema, giving rise to chiroptical selection rules that are fundamental to valleytronics. Here, we bridge the gap between these two concepts and introduce Floquet-Bloch valleytronics. Using time- and polarization-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy combined with state-of-the-art ab initio theory, we demonstrate the formation of valley-polarized Floquet-Bloch states in 2H-WSe$_2$ upon below-bandgap coherent electron driving with chiral light pulses. We investigate quantum path interference between Floquet-Bloch and Volkov states, showing that this interferometric process depends on the valley pseudospin and light polarization-state. Conducting extreme ultraviolet photoemission circular dichroism in these nonequilibrium settings reveals the potential for controlling the orbital character of Floquet-engineered states. These findings link Floquet engineering and quantum geometric light-matter coupling in two-dimensional materials. They can serve as a guideline for reaching novel out-of-equilibrium phases of matter by dynamically breaking symmetries through coherent dressing of winding Bloch electrons with tailored light pulses.

Title: Automated in situ optimization and disorder mitigation in a quantum device
Authors: Jacob Benestad, Torbjørn Rasmussen, Bertram Brovang, Oswin Krause, Saeed Fallahi, Geoffrey C. Gardner, Michael J. Manfra, Charles M. Marcus, Jeroen Danon, Ferdinand Kuemmeth, Anasua Chatterjee, Evert van Nieuwenburg
Abstract: We investigate automated in situ optimization of the potential landscape in a quantum point contact device, using a $3 \times 3$ gate array patterned atop the constriction. Optimization is performed using the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy, for which we introduce a metric for how "step-like" the conductance is as the channel becomes constricted. We first perform the optimization of the gate voltages in a tight-binding simulation and show how such in situ tuning can be used to mitigate a random disorder potential. The optimization is then performed in a physical device in experiment, where we also observe a marked improvement in the quantization of the conductance resulting from the optimization procedure.

Title: Quantum transport theory for unconventional magnets: Interplay of altermagnetism and p-wave magnetism with superconductivity
Authors: Tim Kokkeler, Ilya Tokatly, F. Sebastian Bergeret
Abstract: We present a quantum transport theory for generic magnetic metals, in which magnetism occurs predominantly due to exchange interactions, such as ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, altermagnets and p-wave magnets. Our theory is valid both for the normal and the superconducting state. We derive the effective low-energy action for each of these materials, where the spin space groups are used to determine the form of the tensor coefficients appearing in the action. The transport equations, which are obtained as the saddle point equations of this action, describe a wider range of phenomena than the usual quasiclassical equations. In ferromagnets, in addition to the usual exchange field and spin relaxation effects, we identify a spin-dependent renormalization of the diffusion coefficient, which provides a description of spinpolarized currents in both the normal and superconducting equal spin-triplet states. In the normal state, our equations provide a complete description of the spin-splitting effect in diffusive systems, recently predicted in ideal clean altermagnets. In the superconducting state, our equations predict a proximity induced magnetization, the appearance of a spontaneous magnetic moment in hybrid superconductor-altermagnet systems. The distribution and polarization direction of this magnetic moment depend on the symmetry of the structure, thus measurements of such polarization reveal the underlying microscopic symmetry of the altermagnet. Finally, for inversionsymmetry broken antiferromagnets, such as the p-wave magnet, we show that spin-galvanic effects which are distinguishable from the spin-galvanic effect induced by spin-orbit coupling only in the superconducting state. Besides these examples, our model applies to arbitrary magnetic systems, providing a complete theory for nonequilibrium transport in diffusive nonconventional magnets at arbitrary temperatures.

Title: The fate of $p$-wave spin polarization in helimagnets with Rashba spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Erik Wegner Hodt, Hendrik Bentmann, Jacob Linder
Abstract: It has recently been realized that magnetic systems with coplanar magnetic order that are invariant under the combined operation of time-reversal and translation with half a unit cell feature energy bands with a symmetry-protected p-wave spin polarization. Such $p$-wave magnets are a sought-after spin analogy of unconventional triplet superconducting pairing and show promise for use in spintronics. Metallic helimagnets provide a realization of $p$-wave magnetism, but such order often occurs in systems lacking inversion symmetry so that Rashba spin-orbit interactions can be prominent. An important question is therefore how the magnitude and the existence of $p$-wave spin polarization is affected by Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Here, we prove that while the $p$-wave symmetry of the spin-polarized bands is strictly speaking removed by such spin-orbit interactions in helimagnets unless the period of the helix is fine-tuned, the actual quantitative deviation from $p$-wave symmetry is extremely weak unless the period of the helix is only a few lattice sites. Thereafter, we show that the $p$-wave magnetism becomes completely robust in pairs of antiferromagnetically coupled helices. More precisely, the $p$-wave spin-polarization of the bands then appears regardless of the periodicity and regardless of the strength of the spin-orbit interactions. This shows that antiferromagnetically coupled helimagnetic chains produce robust $p$-wave spin polarization free of fine-tuning requirements, making them attractive for potential spintronic applications.

Title: Edge modes in chiral electron double layers
Authors: Klaus Ziegler, Roman Ya. Kezerashvili
Abstract: We study the quasiparticles in chiral double layers with electron pairing within the framework of the Bogoliubov de Gennes equation. In the presence of an edge it is demonstrated that the quasiparticle modes can be distinguished as edge modes and bulk modes, which appear at different energies. The bulk-edge correspondence is obtained by an analytic continuation from the in-gap edge modes to the bands of bulk modes. By varying the energy we find a transition from localized edge modes to delocalized bulk modes. We calculate the quasiparticle currents, discuss briefly how these currents couple to external currents, and predict how this can be used to control the quasiparticle modes.

Title: Low damped acoustic modes in polycrystalline nickel cavities fabricated by ps-laser delamination
Authors: Alba Viejo-Rodríguez, Marco Gandolfi, Andrea Rossetti, Yoav Urbina-Elgueta, Evgeny B. Modin, Svetlana Starikovskaia, Tat Loon Chng, Vasily Temnov, Maria Antonietta Vincenti, Daniele Brida, Paolo Vavassori, Nicolò Maccaferri
Abstract: Single-shot picosecond (ps) laser induced delamination allows for the direct generation of suspended membranes from a continuous metallic film. It is not known if polycrystalline membranes obtained by local ps-pulsed laser delamination of a continuous film on a substrate would show low damping compared to the film. Here, we report on the dynamics of acoustic waves excited by femtosecond light pulses and confined in a single freestanding nickel layer, acting as an acoustic cavity. By combining Fourier transform analysis of the measured pump-probe signal and numerical multi-physics simulations, we show that high-frequency (> 10 GHz) longitudinal acoustic pulses can resonate inside the cavity and display lower damping compared to a reference nickel film on SiO2 substrate given that the conditions of total internal reflection are nearly met in the cavity, even if these cavities display more defects in terms of crystal structure and surface roughness. This result provides evidence that the ps-laser induced local delamination could be effectively utilized, after further optimization, as a flexible process to design on-demand micro-structured systems for opto-acoustic applications.

Title: Photodynamics and Performance Metrics in Cavity-Coupled OLEDs: A Unified Quantum Master Equation Approach
Authors: Olli Siltanen, Kimmo Luoma, Konstantinos S. Daskalakis
Abstract: Controlling light-matter interactions is emerging as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). By embedding the emissive layer in planar microcavities or other modified optical environments, excitons can couple to photonic modes, enabling new regimes of device operation. In the weak-coupling regime, Purcell-enhanced emission can accelerate radiative decay, while in the strong-coupling regime, excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates with altered dynamics. These effects offer potential solutions to key challenges in OLEDs, such as triplet accumulation and efficiency roll-off, yet demonstrations in the strong-coupling case remain sparse and modest. To systematically understand and optimize photodynamics across the different coupling regimes, we develop a unified quantum master equation model for cavity-coupled (and uncoupled) OLEDs. We apply this model to evaluate device performance and explore how photonic environments can be engineered for triplet harvesting, enhanced emission, and beyond.

Title: A phase-field model for solutions of DNA-made particles
Authors: Marco Cappa, Francesco Sciortino, Lorenzo Rovigatti
Abstract: We present a phase-field model based on the Cahn-Hilliard equation to investigate the properties of phase separation in DNA nanostar systems. Leveraging a realistic free-energy functional derived from Wertheim theory, our model captures the thermodynamic properties of self-assembling DNA nanostars under various conditions. This approach allows for the study of both one-component and multi-component systems, including mixtures of different nanostar species and cross-linkers. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the model ability to replicate experimental observations, including liquid-liquid phase separation, surface tension variation, and the structural organisation of multi-component systems. Our results highlight the versatility and predictive power of the Cahn-Hilliard framework, particularly for complex systems where detailed simulations are computationally prohibitive. This work provides a robust foundation for studying DNA-based materials and their potential applications in nanotechnology and biophysics, including liquid-liquid phase separation in cellular environments.

Title: Dipolar magnetostirring protocol for three-well atomtronic circuits
Authors: Héctor Briongos-Merino, Felipe Isaule, Montserrat Guilleumas, Bruno Juliá-Díaz
Abstract: We propose a magnetostirring protocol to create persistent currents on an annular system. Under this protocol, polar bosons confined in a three-well ring circuit reach a state with high average circulation. We model the system with an extended Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian and show that the protocol can create circulation in an atomtronic circuit for a range of tunable parameters. The performance and robustness of this scheme are examined, in particular considering different interaction regimes. We also present a method for predicting the optimal protocol parameters, which improves protocol's scalability and enables its application to systems with large numbers of bosons. This overcomes computational limitations and paves the way for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena.

Title: Quantum correlations and spatial localization in trapped one-dimensional ultra-cold Bose-Bose-Bose mixtures
Authors: Tran Duong Anh-Tai, Miguel A. García-March, Thomas Busch, Thomás Fogarty
Abstract: We systematically investigate and illustrate the complete ground-state phase diagram for a one-dimensional, three-species mixture of a few repulsively interacting bosons trapped harmonically. To numerically obtain the solutions to the many-body Schrödinger equation, we employ the improved Exact Diagonalization method [T. D. Anh-Tai {\it et al.}, SciPost Physics 15, 048 (2023)], which is capable of treating strongly-correlated few-body systems from first principles in an efficiently truncated Hilbert space. We present our comprehensive results for all possible combinations of intra- and interspecies interactions in the extreme limits that are either the ideal limit ($g=0$) or close to the hard-core limit ($g\to\infty$). These results show the emergence of unique ground-state properties related to correlations, coherence and spatial localization stemming from strongly repulsive interactions.

Title: Quantum fluctuations can enhance or reduce positional uncertainty at finite temperature
Authors: Harukuni Ikeda
Abstract: The uncertainty principle guarantees a non-zero value for the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle > 0$, even without thermal fluctuations. This implies that quantum fluctuations inherently enhance positional uncertainty at zero temperature. A natural question then arises: what happens at finite temperatures, where the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations may give rise to complex and intriguing behaviors? To address this question, we systematically investigate the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$, of a particle in equilibrium confined within a nonlinear potential of the form $V(x) \propto x^a$, where $a = 2, 4, 6, \dots$ represents an even exponent. Using path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ in equilibrium as a function of the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\Lambda$. Interestingly, for large values of $a$, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$: it initially decreases with increasing $\Lambda$ at small $\Lambda$ but increases at larger $\Lambda$. To further understand this behavior, we employ a semiclassical approximation, which reveals that quantum fluctuations can reduce positional uncertainty for small $\Lambda$ when the nonlinearity of the potential is sufficiently strong. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this result for many-body phenomena driven by strong nonlinear interactions, such as glass transitions, where the transition densities exhibit a similar non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$.

Title: Strain-induced proximity effect in topological insulator TaSe$_3$
Authors: R.M. Lukmanova, I.A. Cohn, V.E. Minakova, S.V. Zaitsev-Zotov
Abstract: The magnetoresistance of superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor structures, with indium as the superconductor and TaSe$_3$ as the topological insulator, shows steplike features on the resistance under magnetic fields. These resistance steps are resulted from the suppression of superconductivity, induced by the superconducting proximity effect in both the bulk and surface states of the topological insulator. The position and amplitude of the steps, occurring at approximately 0.1 T, show an unusual dependence on the magnitude of the uniaxial strain ($\epsilon$), indicating their connection with surface states. This behavior follows the expected transition sequence: semi-metal $\rightarrow$ strong topological insulator $\rightarrow$ trivial insulator, and supports the presence of surface states at $0.46\% \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 0.85\%$.

Title: Accelerated Transition Rates in Generalized Kramers Problems for Non-Variational, Non-Normal System
Authors: Virgile Troude, Didier Sornette
Abstract: Kramers' escape problem serves as a paradigm for understanding transitions and various types of reactions, such as chemical and nuclear reactions, in systems driven by thermal fluctuations and damping, particularly within the realm of classical variational dynamics. Here, we generalize Kramers' problem to processes with non-normal dynamics characterized by asymmetry, hierarchy, and stochastic fluctuations, where transient amplification and stochastic perturbations play a critical role. The obtained generalized escape rates are structurally similar to those for variational systems, but with a renormalized temperature proportional to the square of the condition number $\kappa$ which measures non-normality. Because $\kappa$ can take large values (e.g., $10$ or more) in many systems, the resulting acceleration of transition rates can be enormous, given the exponential dependence on the inverse temperature in Kramers' formula. As an illustration, our framework offers a potential resolution to the long-standing question in epigenetics of how DNA methylation can proceed with such remarkable speed. By uncovering the role of strong non-normal dynamics, we derive a robust, universal expression for methylation timing that predicts fast, switch-like transitions, on the order of minutes, for a wide range of noise amplitudes and methylation levels, and in agreement with experimental observations. More broadly, our findings indicate that non-normal accelerated escape rates are likely to be a key mechanism underlying rapid transitions in diverse systems, from biological metabolism and ecosystem shifts to climate dynamics and socio-economic processes.

Title: A New Type of MPd5 Kagome Superconductors
Authors: Dan Li, Zhengxuan Wang, Panshi Jing, Mehrdad Shiri, Kun Wang, Chunlan Ma, Shijing Gong, Chuanxi Zhao, Tianxing Wang, Xiao Dong, Lin Zhuang, Wuming Liu, Yipeng An
Abstract: Kagome materials, which are composed of hexagons tiled with a shared triangle, have inspired enormous interest due to their unique structures and rich physical properties, but exploring superconducting material systems with new kagome structures is still an important research direction. Here, we predict a new type of kagome superconductors, MPd5 (M is a group IIA metal element), and identify that they exhibit coexistence of superconductivity and non-trivial topological properties. We uncover their phonon-mediated superconductivity by the density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT), predicting the superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) of 2.64, 2.03, and 1.50 K for CaPd5, SrPd5, and BaPd5, respectively, which can be effectively tuned by external pressure and electron doping. The present results also demonstrate that MPd5 have various topological properties such as, CaPd5 shows topological non-trivial intersection near the Fermi level (EF). Our results indicate that the MPd5 materials can be an emerging material platform with rich exotic physics in their kagome structures, and render themselves excellent candidates for superconducting and advanced functional materials that could be utilized in topological quantum computing and information technology.

Title: Phonon fluctuation diagnostics: Origin of charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals
Authors: Stefan Enzner, Jan Berges, Arne Schobert, Dongjin Oh, Mingu Kang, Riccardo Comin, Ronny Thomale, Tim O. Wehling, Domenico Di Sante, Giorgio Sangiovanni
Abstract: The microsopic origin of the charge-density wave (CDW) in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) kagome metals remains a longstanding question, often revolving around electron-phonon coupling and purely electronic mechanisms involving Van Hove scenarios, nesting, and sublattice interference. To reveal the processes driving the CDW transition, we combine ab-initio calculations analysis of the phonon self-energy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Our momentum-resolved study, supported by ARPES data, reveals that lattice instabilities in the V-135 family of kagome metals appear to also be driven by electronic states far from high-symmetry points, where these states exhibit the strongest coupling with the phonon modes responsible for the CDW distortion. Footing on an interpretation scheme based on phonon fluctuation diagnostics, our work challenges and revises theories that so far have exclusively attributed CDW formation to nesting effects close to the Fermi level.

Title: $t$-$J$ model for strongly correlated two-orbital systems: Application to bilayer nickelate superconductors
Authors: Tatsuya Kaneko, Masataka Kakoi, Kazuhiko Kuroki
Abstract: We derive a $t$-$J$ model applicable to strongly correlated two-orbital systems including bilayer nickelate superconductors. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states raising the on-site Coulomb energy and derive resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.

Title: Vector pulse magnet
Authors: Kosuke Noda, Kenta Seki, Dilip Bhoi, Kazuyuki Matsubayashi, Kazuto Akiba, Akihiko Ikeda
Abstract: The underlying symmetry of the crystal, electronic structure, and magnetic structure manifests itself in the anisotropy of materials' properties, which is a central topic of the present condensed matter research. However, it demands such a considerable effort to fill the explorable space that only a small part has been conquered. We report a vector pulse magnet (VPM) as an alternative experimental technique to control the direction of applied magnetic fields, which may complement the conventional methods with its characteristic features. The VPM combines a conventional pulse magnet and a vector magnet. The VPM can create vector pulsed magnetic fields and swiftly rotating pulsed magnetic fields. As a demonstration, the three-dimensional magnetoresistance measurement of a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite is carried out using the AC four-probe method at 4.5 K and 6 T. The two-dimensional electronic structure of graphite is visualized in the three-dimensional magnetoresistance data. One can uncover the rotational and time-reversal symmetry of materials using a VPM and a variety of measurement techniques.

Title: Capacity threshold for the Ising perceptron
Authors: Brice Huang
Abstract: We show that the capacity of the Ising perceptron is with high probability upper bounded by the constant $\alpha_\star \approx 0.833$ conjectured by Krauth and Mézard, under the condition that an explicit two-variable function $\mathscr{S}_*(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ is maximized at $(1,0)$. The earlier work of Ding and Sun proves the matching lower bound subject to a similar numerical condition, and together these results give a conditional proof of the conjecture of Krauth and Mézard.

Title: Generalized Gibbs ensembles in weakly interacting dissipative systems and digital quantum computers
Authors: Iris Ulčakar, Zala Lenarčič
Abstract: Identifying use cases with superconducting circuits not critically affected by the inherent noise is a pertinent challenge. Here, we propose using a digital quantum computer to showcase the activation of integrable effects in weakly dissipative integrable systems. Dissipation is realized by coupling the system's qubits to ancillary ones that are periodically reset. We compare the digital reset protocol to the usual Lindblad continuous-time evolution by considering non-interacting integrable systems dynamics, which can be analyzed using scattering between the Bogoliubov quasiparticles caused by the dissipation. If not dominant, the inherent noise would cause extra scattering but would not critically change the physics. A corresponding quantum computer implementation would illuminate the possibilities of stabilizing exotic states in nearly integrable quantum materials.

Title: When resampling/reweighting improves feature learning in imbalanced classification?: A toy-model study
Authors: Tomoyuki Obuchi, Toshiyuki Tanaka
Abstract: A toy model of binary classification is studied with the aim of clarifying the class-wise resampling/reweighting effect on the feature learning performance under the presence of class imbalance. In the analysis, a high-dimensional limit of the input space is taken while keeping the ratio of the dataset size against the input dimension finite and the non-rigorous replica method from statistical mechanics is employed. The result shows that there exists a case in which the no resampling/reweighting situation gives the best feature learning performance irrespectively of the choice of losses or classifiers, supporting recent findings in Cao et al. (2019); Kang et al. (2019). It is also revealed that the key of the result is the symmetry of the loss and the problem setting. Inspired by this, we propose a further simplified model exhibiting the same property in the multiclass setting. These clarify when the class-wise resampling/reweighting becomes effective in imbalanced classification.

Title: Structure-Adaptive Topology Optimization Framework for Photonic Band Gaps with TM-Polarized Sources
Authors: Aditya Bahulikar, Feng Wang, Mustafa Cenk Gursoy, Rodrick Kuate Defo
Abstract: We present a structure-adaptive topology optimization framework for engineering photonic band gaps with TM-polarized sources based on computation of the photonic density of states with a uniform source substituting for the standard Dirac delta function sources in formalisms analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration and to integration over a full Brillouin zone. We generalize the limiting uniform and Dirac delta function sources to more general collections of sources, such that the union of the sources in a given collection is hyperuniform. The uniform-source approach necessarily leads to the fastest computations. We also demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to the treatment of the frequency-dependent optical response of materials. Finally, we show that we can recover known two-dimensional photonic crystals for the TM polarization. A key advantage of our work is its ability to optimize for a specific midgap frequency and band gap in a structure-adaptive manner. Our work leverages the insight that the determination of the minimum supercell size and the minimum precision to which the frequencies within the photonic band gap must be sampled will lead to the observation of photonic-crystal structures when the $\Gamma$-point formalism for the uniform-source approach is employed. Additionally, our $\Gamma$-point and full Brillouin zone formalisms for the uniform-source approach inherently encourage binarized designs even in gradient descent.

Title: Coarse-grained Bootstrap of Quantum Many-body Systems
Authors: Minjae Cho, Colin Oscar Nancarrow, Petar Tadić, Yuan Xin, Zechuan Zheng
Abstract: We present a new computational framework combining coarse-graining techniques with bootstrap methods to study quantum many-body systems. The method efficiently computes rigorous upper and lower bounds on both zero- and finite-temperature expectation values of any local observables of infinite quantum spin chains. This is achieved by using tensor networks to coarse-grain bootstrap constraints, including positivity, translation invariance, equations of motion, and energy-entropy balance inequalities. Coarse-graining allows access to constraints from significantly larger subsystems than previously possible, yielding substantially tighter bounds compared to earlier methods.

Title: Direct Sampling of Confined Polygons in Linear Time
Authors: Clayton Shonkwiler, Kandin Theis
Abstract: We present an algorithm for sampling tightly confined random equilateral closed polygons in three-space which has runtime linear in the number of edges. Using symplectic geometry, sampling such polygons reduces to sampling a moment polytope, and in our confinement model this polytope turns out to be very natural from a combinatorial point of view. This connection to combinatorics yields both our fast sampling algorithm and explicit formulas for the expected distances of vertices to the origin. We use our algorithm to investigate the expected total curvature of confined polygons, leading to a very precise conjecture for the asymptotics of total curvature.

Title: Decoding the Competing Effects of Dynamic Solvation Structures on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Chemical Shifts of Battery Electrolytes via Machine Learning
Authors: Qi You, Yan Sun, Feng Wang, Jun Cheng, Fujie Tang
Abstract: Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is critical for optimizing the electrochemical performance of rechargeable batteries, as it directly influences properties such as ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical stability. The highly complex structures and strong interactions in high-concentration electrolytes make accurate modeling and interpretation of their ``structure-property" relationships even more challenging with spectroscopic methods. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach to predict dynamic $^7$Li NMR chemical shifts in LiFSI/DME electrolyte solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis to interpret the observed chemical shift behavior in our experiments, particularly the abrupt changes in $^7$Li chemical shifts at high concentrations. Using advanced modeling techniques, we quantitatively establish the relationship between molecular structure and NMR spectra, offering critical insights into solvation structure assignments. Our findings reveal the coexistence of two competing local solvation structures that shift in dominance as electrolyte concentration approaches the concentrated limit, leading to anomalous reverse of $^7$Li NMR chemical shift in our experiment. This work provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of the intricate solvation structures probed by NMR spectroscopy, leading the way for enhanced electrolyte design.

Title: A study of pendular liquid bridge between two equal solid spheres
Authors: James Q Feng
Abstract: Pendular liquid bridges with concave meridians between two equal rigid spheres are mathematically studied emphasizing some less analyzed facts in the literature. Discrepancies from the numerical solution of the Young-Laplace equation are examined among typical simplifying approximations and a few curve-fitting formulas. An in-depth analysis is provided about the important role of separation distance between spheres played in pendular ring formation via capillary condensation at a given relative humidity and the strength of subsequent capillary forces. For most practical situations, the toroidal approximation could be reasonably accurate (especially with diminishing separation distance) and provide valuable mathematical insights at least in a qualitative sense with its relatively simple analytical formulas. Using the elliptic meridional profile generally offers more accurate approximations, but with such complicated analytical formulas that it would limit its convenience for practical applications. With a few examples, the present study shows that curve-fitting formulas cannot be perfect and, by their approximative nature, would always leave room for improvements; therefore, care should be taken when applying curve-fitting formulas, to avoid undesirable errors

Title: Flexible radio-frequency transistors exceeding 100 GHz
Authors: Fan Xia, Tian Xia, Haotian Su, Lanyue Gan, Qianlan Hu, Wanyi Wang, Ruyi Huang, Tianshun Bai, Yufan Chen, Chao Ma, Guanhua Long, Shan X. Wang, Eric Pop, Lian-Mao Peng, Youfan Hu
Abstract: The advent of 6G communication demands seamlessly integrated terminals operating above 100 GHz with low power consumption for human-centric applications. In this work, we report high-performance, flexible radio-frequency (RF) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) based on aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays, achieving, for the first time, as-measured current gain cutoff frequency (fT) and power gain cutoff frequency (fmax) both exceeding 100 GHz. Electro-thermal co-design improves both heat dissipation and RF performance, despite the low thermal conductivity of the flexible substrate. The transistors deliver 0.947 mA/$\mathrm{mu}$m on-state current and 0.728 mS/$\mathrm{mu}$m transconductance. Peak extrinsic $f_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $f_{\mathrm{max}}$ reach 152 GHz and 102 GHz with power consumption < 200 mW/mm, setting new performance records for flexible CNT-based RF transistors by nearly 100$\times$, outperforming all other flexible RF MOSFETs. Additionally, flexible RF amplifiers achieve 64 mW/mm output power and 11 dB power gain in the K-band, marking a significant milestone in flexible RF technologies for next-generation wireless communication systems.

Title: A Radio-Frequency Emitter Design for the Low-Frequency Regime in Atomic Experiments
Authors: Yudong Wei, Zhongshu Hu, Yajing Guo, Zhentian Qian, Shengjie Jin, Xuzong Chen, Xiong-jun Liu
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) control is a key technique in cold atom experiments. We present a compact and efficient RF circuit based on a capacitive transformer, where a low-frequency coil operating up to 30 MHz serves as both inductor and power-sharing element. The design enables high current and flexible matching bandwidth, and integrates broadband and narrowband RF manipulation within a unified configuration, overcoming the distance constraints imposed by metallic chambers. In evaporative cooling, the broadband circuit reduces RF input power from 14.7 dBW to -3.5 dBW due to its low-pass behavior, effectively cooling the Bose-Fermi mixture to below 10{\mu}K. In a Landau-Zener protocol, the narrowband circuit transfers 80% of rubidium atoms from |F=2, mF=2> to |2, -2> in 1 millisecond, yielding a Rabi frequency of about 7.6 kHz under an input power of 0.1 dBW. The concise design ensures robust impedance matching and stable performance across a wide frequency range, with behavior closely consistent with lumped-element simulations.

Title: Analytical model for balling defects in laser melting using rivulet theory and solidification
Authors: Zane Taylor, Tharun Reddy, Maureen Fitzpatrick, Kwan Kim, Wei Li, Chu Lun Alex Leung, Peter D. Lee, Kaila M. Bertsch, Leora Dresselhaus-Marais
Abstract: In the laser welding and additive manufacturing (AM) communities, the balling defect is primarily attributed to the action of fluid instabilities with a few authors suggesting other mechanisms. Without commenting on the validity of the fluid instability driven \textit{mechanism} of balling in AM, this work intends to present the most realistic analytical discussion of the balling defect driven purely by fluid instabilities. Synchrotron-based X-ray radiography of thin samples indicate that fluid instability growth rates and solidification can be comparable in magnitude and thus compete. Neglecting the action of fluid flows and heat transport, this work presents an analytical formalism which accounts for fluid instabilities and solidification competition, giving a continuous transition from balling to non-balling which is lacking in current literature. We adapt a Rivulet instability model from the fluid physics community to account for the stabilizing effects of the substrate which the Plateau-Rayleigh instability model does not account for, and estimate the instability growth rate. Our model predicts instability growth at higher wavelengths and shallower melt pool depths relative to width, as well as strong sensitivity to the solidification front curvature. Deviations between model predictions and our experimental results demonstrate the importance of fluid flows and heat transport in the balling process. Our experiments further demonstrate at least one mechanism by which the melt pool length and balling wavelength are not equivalent, as commonly claimed.

Title: Collective Superradiance: Estimating the Peak Emission Rate and Time
Authors: Raphael Holzinger, Susanne Yelin
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.

Title: Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive
Authors: Raúl A. Briceño, William Gyory, Thomas Iadecola, Srimoyee Sen
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.

Title: Quantum Simulation of the Unruh Temperature Via the Thermal Properties of Virtually Evolving Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Imad-Eddine Chorfi, Nacer eddine Belaloui, Abdellah Tounsi, Achour Benslama, Mohamed Taha Rouabah
Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.
